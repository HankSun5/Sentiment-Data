And this is exactly why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , going for just $0.035, is racing towards becoming the next crypto to explode, especially as comparisons grow increasingly unavoidable as they are drawn against Shiba Inu (SHIB). Unlike mainstream DeFi, Mutuum is pioneering a truly new DeFi credit economy platform that supports under-collateralized loan services, something that mainstream DeFi has never quite managed successfully before. It is being recognized as the top crypto for investors looking for utility and early-stage growth. Shiba Inu Experiencing Deep Correction as Support Lines are Tested Shiba Inu (SHIB), despite being under heavy bear market pressures, has seen its price plummet down due to its recent breakdown, descending down towards a 23-month low of about $0.00000837, as was seen through most of 2024. Although having increasingly growing burn rates, decreasing exchange balances, and, quite amazingly, its own SHIB Spot ETF filing by asset manager T. Rowe Price, managing funds of $1.7 trillion, Shiba Inu has yet to spark a potential buy signal and reverse its market trend positively once again. Presently, holders of Shiba Inu, who had purchased it at its opening value this year, have decreased by 57% since Shiba Inu has managed to breach more than a few technical support levels, including its moving averages of 20, 50, and 200 days. Support can be expected around price levels of $0.000006, while its relief rally would have to reclaim price points above $0.00001150 through $0.00001220 if it is going to turn its trend positively again. Because of its currently weakening market structure, some investors have turned their focus on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the next crypto to explode. Mutuum Finance Drives the Next DeFi Innovation Wave Mutuum Finance is quickly appearing as one of the most visionary forces on the horizon of the market of decentralized finance. Its presale is still ongoing and has been beating all estimates, having attracted over 17,810 participants and raising more than $18.5 million. All this indicates that Mutuum Finance is the top crypto on offer on today’s market. Smart, Transparent, and Open Lending on Web3 Also at the core of this platform is a new loan and borrow system that has been designed as a means of addressing many of the issues identified as problematic through previous DeFi platforms that have been used as a model for Mutuum Finance’s design and functionality. Mutuum Finance enables borrowers and lenders to agree on repayment terms, as well as enables borrowers to have flexible loan rates that vary based on market conditions. Establishing a New Benchmark for Future DeFi Platforms Through its focus on openness, user empowerment, and economic design, Mutuum Finance is setting up a solid platform for what is expected of DeFi in the coming years. Mutuum Finance is bringing back trust and functionality into DeFi and providing a platform for value creation through actual usage as opposed to hype. With time, Mutuum Finance is emerging not only as an investment token, but as a system that is expected to cultivate participation and sustainability through financial growth that is community-oriented. Mutuum Finance has currently managed to onboard over 17,810 investors and has garnered over $18.5 million, with Phase 6 of its presale more than 85% sold out at a price of $0.035. Mutuum is filling a market need that many other altcoins, such as Shiba Inu, have been unable to address through its utility-focused DeFi platform and its provision of under-collateralized loan services and transparent loan conditions that many DeFi platforms lack today due to scalability issues and technology constraints. Investors looking for the next crypto to explode have a great entry point before Phase 7’s price increases to $0.04, positioning Mutuum Finance as the top crypto for the coming market cycle. Take immediate action through the official presale of Mutuum Finance to buy tokens at entry price and prepare for potential high growth returns, making it the next crypto to explode.

54213555,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=856631,1762725600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/54213555.jpeg,How RentStac (RNS) Is Transforming DeFi and Creating New Millionaires,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/how-rentstac-rns-is-transforming-defi-and-creating-new-millionaires/,"The DeFi market is rapidly evolving as investors search for projects that connect blockchain with tangible assets, as RentStac (RNS) does.This crypto has entered the spotlight by merging decentralized finance with real estate income, offering a structured and transparent way for users to participate in property-backed yield through the blockchain. According to verified data, the token sale price begins at $0.025 per RNS , progressing through seven presale stages. The total supply is fixed at 2 billion tokens , with 40 percent (800 million) allocated to the presale. The full target across all stages is approximately $27.45 million , as stated in the project’s official documentation. Real Utility Behind the Trend While many DeFi projects rely purely on speculation, this crypto is building on the real economy. It tokenizes rental properties through legally registered structures known as SPVs, converting real rental income into blockchain-based rewards. This connection between traditional finance and DeFi is driving attention from analysts focused on long-term sustainability. The platform distributes yield in stablecoins, introduces a buyback-and-burn model to reduce circulating supply, and integrates DAO-based governance. All these mechanisms are designed to ensure that token value reflects real usage and revenue, not short-term market hype. Security and Transparency Security and transparency are central to this project’s development. The official site reports a Solidity Scan score of 92.48 percent , showing a high level of smart contract integrity. The team has also announced a full CertiK audit , with results to be published upon completion. Each property listed on the platform is linked to an SPV, allowing legal and financial verification of ownership. Multi-signature wallets and oracle feeds are used to verify data before any on-chain updates occur. These practices make the system auditable and compliant with emerging DeFi standards. Token Structure and Growth Potential The token model is designed to support long-term growth. Staking allows holders to earn a share of the platform’s income, while governance tools give participants the power to vote on new property integrations and fee structures. A portion of transaction revenue is allocated for token buybacks and permanent burns, reducing total supply over time. Now, with the 100% bonus currently active , investors receive double the tokens for every purchase during the presale. This changes the potential outcomes dramatically. At the presale price of $0.025 per token , a $10,000 investment normally provides 400,000 tokens , but with the bonus , the total becomes 800,000 tokens . If the token reaches $1 , that same holding would be worth $800,000 . To hit the $1,000,000 mark , an investor would need roughly $12,500 invested at the current presale stage (since $12,500 × 2 = $25,000 worth of tokens → 1,000,000 tokens × $1 = $1,000,000). That’s the potential upside when combining early entry pricing with the bonus multiplier — an opportunity only available during the presale period. A New Direction for DeFi This crypto represents a growing movement within decentralized finance, one focused on real assets and measurable results. By connecting blockchain infrastructure with rental income and property liquidity, it creates a sustainable model that could outlast many purely speculative tokens. With its fixed supply, transparent presale system, and integration of asset-backed yield, RentStac (RNS) is shaping up to be one of the most distinctive entries in this new DeFi cycle.

Institutional capital is returning, and projects that pair innovation with credibility are set to lead the next growth phase. Among the top crypto to buy in 2025, four names consistently stand out: BlockDAG, XRP, Ethereum, and Solana. Each represents a cornerstone of crypto’s evolution, from scalability and regulation to infrastructure and adoption. BlockDAG’s record-breaking $435 million presale and rapid ecosystem expansion position it alongside XRP’s payment leadership, Ethereum’s ongoing upgrades, and Solana’s accelerating institutional inflows. Together, these projects highlight a shift toward tangible progress and real-world use cases, setting the tone for what could become crypto’s strongest cycle of sustained growth yet. BlockDAG: Countdown to Final Phase With Only 4.3B Coins Left The countdown has officially begun for BlockDAG’s Value Era. With BDAG priced at just $0.005 in Batch 32, this marks the final stage before prices climb higher. BlockDAG (BDAG) has already raised $435 million, leaving only 4.3 billion coins remaining before the presale concludes. Over 312,000 holders, 20,000+ X-Series miners sold, and 3.5 million+ X1 mobile app users form one of the largest active communities in blockchain today. This phase defines scarcity. All bonuses and promotional resets have ended, creating a structured model where each stage increases in price. Once Batch 32 is complete, the next tier will be costlier, reinforcing urgency for those tracking the best crypto to buy now. The Value Era is not marketing, it is mathematics. Every stage closed means fewer tokens at a higher rate, and each passing day narrows the discount window. BlockDAG’s appeal lies not only in price but in measurable progress. Its hybrid Proof-of-Work and Directed Acyclic Graph architecture, combined with EVM compatibility and verified audits, establishes both speed and security. As the presale moves closer to its $600 million goal, momentum continues to build across global markets. For participants seeking disciplined structure and early-stage advantage, BlockDAG’s Value Era offers clarity, scarcity, and timing, all converging right now. XRP: The Payment Powerhouse Reinventing Liquidity Few projects command institutional attention like XRP, still one of the top crypto to buy in 2025 for those betting on real-world adoption. Ripple Labs’ planned 1 billion XRP unlock, worth around $2.5 billion,has raised eyebrows across the market. While skeptics see it as a supply pressure risk, others interpret it as a step toward greater transparency and ecosystem maturity. XRP’s real strength lies in its positioning as a cross-border payment layer. With $3 billion in open interest on CME and renewed partnerships with global financial institutions, it’s clear institutional money hasn’t lost faith. The token’s near-term volatility could present entry opportunities for investors aiming for long-term exposure in global remittances. If XRP can maintain stability around its $2.30–$2.40 support while scaling up utility-based transactions, it could reassert itself as one of 2025’s most reliable Layer-1 assets. Its mix of liquidity, compliance evolution, and sustained corporate adoption makes it a compelling top crypto to buy in 2025 for risk-adjusted investors. Ethereum: A Quiet Giant Readying Its Next Leap Despite shifting narratives, Ethereum remains the anchor of Web3 infrastructure,and arguably the top crypto to buy in 2025 for institutional portfolios. While short-term ETF inflows have cooled, Ethereum’s roadmap continues to signal long-term growth. The upcoming Fusaka hard fork, scheduled for December 3, introduces PeerDAS, a feature designed to optimize data availability for roll-ups and layer-2 networks. What does this mean? Better scalability, improved efficiency, and more value flowing through its ecosystem. Ethereum is currently consolidating around the $3,865 mark, with resistance near $4,000. If this upgrade strengthens network activity and reduces congestion, ETH could see renewed upside momentum heading into 2025. While competitors like Solana and BlockDAG are gaining attention, Ethereum’s combination of maturity, liquidity, and developer dominance continues to make it a cornerstone of any diversified portfolio. For those seeking balance between innovation and stability, ETH remains a must-have among the top crypto to buy in 2025. Solana: Institutional Magnet with Record-Breaking Metrics No list of the top crypto to buy in 2025 is complete without Solana. Once written off after its network outages, Solana has bounced back stronger than ever, with $155 million in ETF inflows and more than 70 million daily transactions recorded in October. Its decentralized exchanges processed over $143 billion that same month,a staggering figure for a single-layer chain. Institutional appetite is accelerating, and Solana’s focus on speed, DeFi, and real-world scalability is paying off. Analysts from Bitwise even position Solana as one of the “two ways to win” in crypto alongside Bitcoin. The network’s next phase will depend on converting transaction volume into sustained user engagement across DeFi, gaming, and tokenized assets. If Solana maintains its upward trajectory while strengthening developer retention, it could become the fastest-growing institutional blockchain of 2025. With its tech-driven fundamentals and rising mainstream recognition, Solana sits firmly among the top crypto to buy in 2025. Final Verdict As the crypto landscape matures, this new era favors fundamentals over hype. BlockDAG’s record-breaking $435M presale, XRP’s expanding institutional presence, Ethereum’s network evolution, and Solana’s surging adoption form the backbone of the market’s next cycle. For early investors, the signal is clear: the top crypto to buy in 2025 are those solving real problems, scaling for mass use, and driving new waves of capital. Whether traders seek disruptive potential (BlockDAG), cross-border strength (XRP), proven infrastructure (Ethereum), or high-speed innovation (Solana), these four names represent the core pillars of crypto’s next bull phase. The momentum has already begun. Those who move now are positioning themselves ahead of the curve, where the next wave of value will inevitably rise.

While the general market sentiment suggests that the end of the bull cycle might be near, the latest on-chain data indicates that the premier cryptocurrency might merely be undergoing a reset. According to a blockchain firm’s report, the recent sluggishness seems to be setting the stage for the coin’s next major move. BTC Not In A Cycle Exhaustion Phase: XWIN In the latest Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, XWIN Research Japan revealed that the current situation of Bitcoin looks less like the end of a cycle and more like a restructuring phase. The DeFi firm believes that the market foundations are being reset after the clearing out of excess leverage in recent weeks. Supporting the claim of reduced leverage, XWIN Research highlighted that open interest in the Bitcoin future market has reduced significantly since late October. This decline in open interest signals the exit of short-term traders from their leveraged positions. The blockchain firm noted that, in past cycle peaks, leveraged trades often increased even at high price levels. However, this euphoric buildup of market positions is not currently the case for Bitcoin, meaning that a cycle top is likely not what is being witnessed. Furthermore, XWIN Research Japan said that the Bitcoin price is currently lacking momentum and not missing structural support. The blockchain firm pinpointed declining demand from United States institutional investors—as spotlighted by the negative Coinbase Premium Index —as one of the factors behind the lack of momentum. As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at around $101,930, reflecting no significant movement in the past 24 hours. The flagship cryptocurrency is deep in the red on the weekly timeframe, though, having suffered an 8% price decline in the last seven days. Bitcoin Market Shows Both Strengths And Weaknesses Despite the weakened institutional demand for BTC, XWIN Research highlighted some positive signs that could contribute to the cryptocurrency’s eventual recovery. For instance, the DeFi firm revealed that Bitcoin exchange reserves remain at multi-year lows, meaning that a limited supply is still available. Additionally, stablecoin liquidity is gradually flowing back into the market; this means that purchasing power is also returning, and investors might just be waiting for the right time. However, XWIN Research noted that, despite the obvious market resilience, the current sentiment suggests a range-bound movement in the short term.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-09 22:00:08

The CFTC’s acting chair has revealed exciting discussions about launching spot crypto services with major exchanges. This breakthrough could transform how Americans access cryptocurrency markets through regulated platforms. What Are CFTC Spot Crypto Services and Why Do They Matter? The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is actively working to bring regulated spot crypto services to the market. Acting Chair Caroline Pham confirmed that these discussions involve not just traditional financial giants but also innovative crypto-native platforms. This represents a significant step toward mainstream cryptocurrency adoption. These spot crypto services would allow direct trading of cryptocurrencies rather than just derivatives. The CFTC’s involvement brings crucial regulatory oversight that could boost investor confidence. Moreover, the inclusion of leveraged instruments suggests comprehensive market coverage. Which Exchanges Are Involved in These Groundbreaking Talks? The CFTC’s conversations span across diverse market participants. Traditional powerhouses like Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Cboe Futures Exchange are at the table. However, the real excitement comes from including companies like: Coinbase Derivatives Kalshi Polymarket US This diverse participation ensures that the resulting spot crypto services will serve various market segments. The blend of established institutions and innovative newcomers creates a balanced regulatory approach. How Will These New Spot Crypto Services Benefit Traders? Regulated spot crypto services offer multiple advantages for market participants. First, they provide enhanced consumer protection through established regulatory frameworks. Second, institutional investors gain comfortable entry points into cryptocurrency markets. The inclusion of leveraged products within these spot crypto services addresses sophisticated trader needs. This comprehensive approach could attract significant capital from traditional finance sectors. Furthermore, standardized procedures may reduce operational risks associated with cryptocurrency trading. What Challenges Might These Regulatory Efforts Face? Implementing spot crypto services through CFTC-regulated exchanges presents several hurdles. Regulatory clarity remains an ongoing concern across different jurisdictions. Additionally, technological integration between traditional and crypto systems requires careful planning. Market participants must adapt to new compliance requirements. However, the potential benefits of regulated spot crypto services outweigh these challenges. The CFTC’s proactive approach demonstrates commitment to fostering innovation while maintaining market integrity. When Can We Expect These Services to Launch? According to recent reports, the timeline appears remarkably aggressive. The CFTC aims to have initial spot crypto services operational as early as next month. This accelerated schedule reflects both market demand and regulatory readiness. The rapid progression suggests that groundwork has been underway for some time. Market participants should prepare for potentially swift implementation of these new spot crypto services. Early adoption could provide competitive advantages in the evolving regulatory landscape. Conclusion: A New Era for Cryptocurrency Regulation The CFTC’s push for spot crypto services marks a pivotal moment in digital asset regulation. This initiative bridges traditional finance with innovative cryptocurrency markets. Investors, traders, and the broader financial ecosystem stand to benefit from these regulated access points. As these developments unfold, market participants should stay informed about evolving requirements. The successful implementation of spot crypto services could set new standards for global cryptocurrency regulation. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly are spot crypto services? Spot crypto services enable direct trading of cryptocurrencies at current market prices, unlike derivatives which are based on future price expectations. Why is the CFTC involved in spot cryptocurrency markets? The CFTC regulates commodity futures and options markets in the US, and since cryptocurrencies are classified as commodities, they fall under its jurisdiction. How will these services differ from existing crypto exchanges? CFTC-regulated spot crypto services will operate under established financial regulations, offering enhanced consumer protections and institutional-grade infrastructure. Can retail investors access these new services? Yes, these services are designed to be accessible to both institutional and retail investors through regulated exchange platforms. What cryptocurrencies will be available initially? While specific assets haven’t been confirmed, major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are likely candidates for initial offerings. How will leverage work in these spot crypto services? Leveraged instruments will allow traders to amplify their positions, similar to margin trading in traditional markets, but with regulatory oversight.

By 2028, ADAUSD could reach $3.28 By 2031, Cardano might reach a maximum price of $10.08 Cardano is a third-generation blockchain platform launched in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson. Designed for decentralized applications and smart contracts, it uses Ouroboros—a unique, energy-efficient Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. Cardano’s two-layer architecture separates transactions from smart contracts, enhancing scalability and flexibility. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, is used for transaction fees, staking, and governance, allowing holders to influence the platform’s future. Emphasizing a research-driven, peer-reviewed development approach, Cardano aims to tackle blockchain challenges like scalability and sustainability, making it a strong alternative to platforms like Ethereum. Perhaps you’re wondering: with its innovative technology, can Cardano’s ADA reach new all-time highs soon? Let’s uncover what the future holds for Cardano. Overview Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $0.5230 Market Cap $18.69B Trading Volume (24-hour) $1.86B Circulating Supply 44.99B ADA All-time High $3.10 on Sept 02, 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on Oct 01, 2017 24-hour High $0.5624 24-hour Low $0.4934 Cardano price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 11.56% (Very High) 50-day SMA $ 0.7441 14-Day RSI 30.29 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 21 ( Extreme Fear) Green Days 12/30 (40%) 200-day SMA $ 0.7475 Cardano (ADA) price analysis Cardano shows signs of stabilizing around the $0.52 level with oversold RSI hinting at a short-term rebound Holding above $0.50 could push ADA toward $0.55 or $0.58 in the near term A drop below $0.50 may lead to further declines toward $0.47 as momentum remains cautious Cardano price analysis 1-day chart: Cardano stabilizes near support but bearish pressure remains The 1-day chart shows Cardano trading near $0.56, following a prolonged downtrend. Price remains below the 20-day and 50-day moving averages, indicating ongoing bearish momentum. The Bollinger Bands are slightly tightening, suggesting reduced volatility and potential consolidation. ADAUSD 1-day price chart by TradingView RSI at 36 signals ADA is approaching oversold territory, which may limit further downside in the short term. If buyers step in, a rebound toward $0.60–$0.62 is possible, but meaningful trend reversal requires a breakout above the 50-day MA near $0.70. If weakness persists, the next support lies around $0.51–$0.50. Overall, ADA is stabilizing but still leans bearish. ADA price analysis 4-hour chart: Cardano holds Support at $0.55 while eyeing a break toward $0.60 resistance Cardano is showing short-term stabilization after a prior downtrend, trading near $0.56 with price consolidating between the Bollinger mid-band and lower band. The MACD is slightly positive, signaling early bullish momentum, but the slope is weak, indicating no strong trend yet. If buyers hold price above the $0.55 support zone, ADA may retest $0.59–$0.60 resistance. ADAUSD 4-hour price chart by TradingView However, rejection at this level could trigger a pullback toward $0.54 or $0.52. Overall, ADA is in a cautious recovery phase. A sustained breakout above $0.60 is needed to confirm a shift into stronger upward momentum. ADA technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.6719 SELL SMA 5 $ 0.6564 SELL SMA 10 $ 0.6694 SELL SMA 21 $ 0.6525 SELL SMA 50 $ 0.7441 SELL SMA 100 $ 0.7924 SELL SMA 200 $ 0.7475 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 0.6791 SELL EMA 5 $0.7861 SELL EMA 10 $ 0.8158 SELL EMA 21 $ 0.8344 SELL EMA 50 $ 0.8142 SELL EMA 100 $ 0.7776 SELL EMA 200 $ 0.7455 SELL What to expect from the Cardano price analysis next? Cardano’s price action currently reflects a cautious recovery phase, with the token holding above the $0.55 support level on the 4-hour chart. The RSI remains near neutral territory, suggesting neither strong bullish nor bearish dominance. The MACD shows early signs of positive momentum, indicating a possible attempt toward the $0.59–$0.60 resistance zone. However, the upper Bollinger Band is tightening, which signals reduced volatility and a potential breakout soon. If buyers sustain pressure above $0.60, ADA may target $0.63 next. Conversely, failure to hold $0.55 could trigger a decline toward $0.52 support in the short term. Is Cardano a good investment? Cardano (ADA) presents a mixed investment opportunity. It is a third-generation blockchain that aims to solve scalability issues and enhance security through its Proof-of-Stake mechanism. While some analysts predict significant price increases by 2030, others caution that it remains a high-risk investment due to the volatile nature of the crypto market. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and research before investing, as Cardano’s future performance is uncertain and contingent on market conditions and technological advancements. Will Cardano recover? Cardano’s recovery potential depends on market sentiment and adoption. Despite past challenges, its projected price increase in 2025, potentially reaching $1, has significantly bolstered confidence in the coin’s future. Will Cardano reach $5? Cardano hitting $5 seems quite achievable given past levels. With its ATH around $3.10, $5 would only need to beat that peak by about 60%. A solid bull run and some serious adoption could usher in a unit price of $5. Will Cardano reach $10? Cardano hitting $10 is a long shot. Its all-time high was around $3.10 back in 2021, so $10 would mean more than tripling that peak. From current prices, that’s over a 13x jump. While crypto can be unpredictable, that would need massive adoption and a bull run far beyond what we saw in 2021. Will Cardano reach $50? Cardano hitting $50 is extremely likely. With ADA’s current supply of around 35 billion tokens, a $50 price would require a market cap of approximately $1.75 trillion. Even in crypto’s craziest bull runs, that kind of valuation doesn’t happen for altcoins. What is the Cardano forecast for 2040? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2040 is highly speculative as it depends on multiple factors, including adoption, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and macroeconomic conditions. However, if Cardano continues its development in smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and blockchain efficiency, it could see widespread adoption, driving its price higher. Some optimistic projections suggest that ADA could reach double-digit prices, possibly ranging from $10 to $50 or more. However, in a bearish scenario, where regulatory hurdles and competition slow its progress, ADA could struggle to maintain high valuations. What will be the future price of Cardano in 2050? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2050 is highly speculative, but if blockchain adoption continues to grow and Cardano successfully scales its smart contract ecosystem, its price could see significant appreciation. What that number will be remains to be seen. Does Cardano have a good long-term future? Cardano (ADA) has the potential for a positive long-term future, primarily driven by its technological advancements and growing ecosystem. The platform’s unique features, such as its focus on scalability and partnerships with various institutions, position it well for future adoption. However, its success will depend on overcoming regulatory scrutiny and developer engagement challenges. Recent news/opinion on Cardano Cardano has officially joined forces with the Brave browser.

Dogecoin (DOGE) price action is locked near $0.19, showing resilience against market noise. Shiba Inu (SHIB) burn rate has spiked by an incredible 71,000%, a clear sign of intense community-led scarcity. Yet, one project is fundamentally changing the discussion. BlockDAG (BDAG) has become the most important ecosystem in 2025. The presale has already secured $435M+ raised. The price is fixed at $0.005 in batch 32. Most importantly, the project has 20+ exchange listings secured before launch. BlockDAG (BDAG) is now entering its critical Value Era. This phase signals maturity, transparency, and high institutional confidence. These traits confirm its position as the top crypto to buy for smart, forward-looking traders. Shiba Inu’s Massive Burn Rate: Is Scarcity Enough? Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) burn rate has shocked the market. It saw a massive 71,687% jump in just 24 hours. This removed over 29.43 million coins from circulation. This huge deflationary event demonstrates the power of its dedicated community and the coin’s built-in scarcity plan. Over 410 trillion SHIB have been permanently destroyed. This fuels long-term optimism, even though traders remain cautious in the short term. The surge in Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) burn rate helped push the price up slightly to $0.00001043. This put the coin’s market cap back above $6 billion. Analysts suggest a sharp rally could happen if SHIB can clear resistance between $0.00001250–$0.00001350. Lower exchange inflows, down 62%, show that holders are strongly refusing to sell their supply. As the deflationary story grows stronger, SHIB remains one of the top crypto to buy for people chasing high, volatility-driven gains. Dogecoin Price: Holding as Whales Shift Dogecoin’s (DOGE) price action has found stability around $0.19. This happened despite a small 3% daily dip. It successfully holds a crucial support level. However, trading volume surged by 60%, moving past $2 billion. This signals strong market interest from both retail and large-scale traders. Whale movements are creating speculation. Over $26 million in DOGE was moved to Binance. Another $3 million was withdrawn. This suggests a complex movement of liquidity is happening before a potential price rebound. Technically, Dogecoin’s (DOGE) price action shows mixed signals. A “death cross” of the 50-day and 200-day moving averages suggests possible weakness. Yet, whale accumulation of over $134 million in recent weeks shows deep underlying support. Analysts pinpoint immediate resistance between $0.204 and $0.210. Possible breakout targets sit at $0.25, $0.33, and even $0.50. If support holds, Dogecoin could again prove why it is one of the top crypto to buy in terms of community strength and explosive potential. BlockDAG $0.005: Poised for Unstoppable Growth BlockDAG is positioning itself as a blockchain project focused on steady development and adoption. The presale is currently in Batch 32 at a price of $0.005, with more than $435 million reportedly raised. The project’s current phase, called the Value Era, represents the final stage of the presale. During this phase, all early bonuses and promotional rewards have concluded. Purchases now follow a structured vesting schedule, with 40% of coins released immediately and the remaining 60% distributed over three months. This schedule aims to promote orderly distribution and transparency. The Value Era has drawn attention from institutional participants and individual users seeking projects with clear operational frameworks. The newly updated Dashboard V4 enhances the user experience, providing live trading simulations, real-time data, and order book information. BlockDAG has also confirmed listings on 20 exchanges, increasing accessibility and liquidity. Combined with the stated $600 million presale target, these developments demonstrate a focus on systematic growth and network sustainability. By emphasizing structured coin release, active participation, and accessible tools, BlockDAG aims to support consistent adoption. The Value Era reflects the project’s approach to growth, focusing on transparency, functionality, and practical engagement with users and trading platforms. The Final Analysis: BlockDAG Is the Future Top Crypto to Buy As the market fluctuates, these three coins sit at the crossroads of movement and maturity. Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) burn rate continues to fuel deflationary dreams. Dogecoin’s (DOGE) price action shows resilience against market pressure. BlockDAG’s $0.005 Value Era positions it for a historic breakout. In a market often driven by fleeting speculation, BlockDAG’s combination of verified progress, institutional backing, and transparent structure gives it an unbeatable edge. It is not just following the market; it is actively setting its future direction. For traders seeking the top crypto to buy with high growth and reliability, the message is simple: BlockDAG is building the foundation for lasting, massive value.

This week, traders witnessed a stunning $960 gap as the market reopened, creating both excitement and opportunity for savvy investors. Understanding these CME Bitcoin futures movements can unlock valuable trading insights. What Exactly Are CME Bitcoin Futures Gaps? CME Bitcoin futures gaps occur when there’s a significant difference between Friday’s closing price and Monday’s opening price. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) closes for the weekend, while Bitcoin’s spot market operates 24/7. This creates a fascinating dynamic where weekend volatility directly impacts Monday’s CME Bitcoin futures opening. This recent $960 gap saw contracts jump from $104,160 to $105,120. The substantial movement demonstrates how weekend trading activity in the spot market can create immediate opportunities when CME Bitcoin futures resume trading. Why Do CME Futures Gaps Matter for Traders? Traders closely monitor CME Bitcoin futures gaps because they often present predictable trading patterns. Many investors watch for these gaps to fill, meaning the price tends to move back toward the original closing level. However, this isn’t guaranteed – sometimes gaps expand further. Price discovery : Gaps reveal hidden weekend market sentiment Trading signals : Large gaps often indicate strong momentum Risk management : Understanding gaps helps set appropriate stop losses Opportunity identification : Gaps can highlight undervalued or overvalued conditions How Can You Profit from CME Bitcoin Futures Gaps? Successful traders develop strategies around CME Bitcoin futures gaps. The key lies in understanding whether a gap will fill or continue expanding. Historical data shows that most CME gaps eventually fill, but timing is crucial. Consider these approaches when trading CME Bitcoin futures gaps: Wait for confirmation before entering trades Use multiple time frame analysis Monitor spot market correlations Set realistic profit targets based on gap size What Makes This $960 Gap So Significant? This particular CME Bitcoin futures gap of $960 represents substantial weekend volatility. The size indicates strong market movement during the CME’s closure, potentially driven by major news events or institutional activity. Such large gaps in CME Bitcoin futures often precede significant price trends. Traders should note that larger gaps typically take longer to fill, if they fill at all. The current CME Bitcoin futures environment suggests continued institutional interest and market maturity. Mastering CME Bitcoin Futures Trading Understanding CME Bitcoin futures gaps provides a competitive edge in cryptocurrency trading. These patterns offer valuable insights into market sentiment and potential price movements.

The $960 gap serves as a powerful reminder that cryptocurrency markets never sleep, even when traditional exchanges close. This creates unique opportunities for alert traders who understand how CME Bitcoin futures interact with continuous spot markets. Frequently Asked Questions What causes CME Bitcoin futures gaps? CME Bitcoin futures gaps occur because the exchange closes on weekends while Bitcoin’s spot market trades continuously. Weekend price movements create the difference between Friday’s close and Monday’s open. How often do CME futures gaps fill? Most CME Bitcoin futures gaps eventually fill, though the timing varies. Some fill within days, while others may take weeks. Larger gaps typically take longer to close. Are CME gaps reliable trading signals? While CME gaps provide valuable information, they shouldn’t be used as standalone signals. Combine gap analysis with other technical indicators and market fundamentals for better accuracy. Can retail traders benefit from CME gaps? Absolutely. Both institutional and retail traders can develop strategies around CME Bitcoin futures gaps.

The paper reported, without citing sources, that a letter of intent to resolve the trade deadlock is expected in the coming weeks, ahead of a deal set to be presented at the World Economic Forum in Davos this January. The report continued to indicate that Trump and next year’s Swiss President Guy Parmelin, who is also the economy minister, are expected to unveil a plan for U.S. import duties. These duties will be similar to the 15% tariffs Washington has already agreed with the European Union, assuming all goes as planned. Swiss business leaders push for trade relief with Trump The Swiss Economic Affairs Ministry did not comment on the report, which follows a visit by Swiss business leaders with Trump on Tuesday. It stated that the meeting, which included executives from MSC, Rolex, Partners Group, Mercuria, and Richemont, as well as MKS, was a private initiative that it supported, but conducted independently of its own efforts. The Swiss ministry stated that the Federal Council is primarily responsible for negotiations with the relevant U.S. authorities, and that Federal Councillor Parmelin maintains regular contact with U.S. officials, including Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. During the visit, the Swiss delegation presented Trump with a Rolex watch for his presidential library and a specially engraved gold bar, according to Blick. The delegation also pledged to work toward reducing the U.S. trade deficit with Switzerland over the next five to seven years. Other proposals included relocating gold smelting operations to the United States within the next 12 to 24 months and supporting U.S. infrastructure projects. Investments in pharmaceuticals and an increase in Swiss purchases of aircraft from American manufacturers were also discussed. Trump showed goodwill towards the proposals, Blick said, while on Friday Greer spoke with Parmelin and Helene Budliger-Artieda from the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) in talks the Swiss side described as “very constructive.” Government negotiations continue amid private-sector initiative Trump had initially imposed a 39% tariff on the country, threatening to drive up costs for chocolatiers, including Lindt , and watchmakers such as the Swatch Group and Rolex SA. Swiss diplomats have also been engaged in negotiations with officials in Washington, hoping to have the levy reduced. The Swiss government was informed about the private-sector push; however, it didn’t control it, according to the Economy Ministry in Bern. “This is a private initiative by Swiss business leaders, which the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs supported in its preparation, but is taking place independently of the Federal Council’s involvement in this matter,” a spokesperson said in an email. The ministry also said that it “welcomes the commitment shown by the companies concerned,” however, that the government remains in charge of negotiations. Economy Minister Guy Parmelin is in regular contact with U.S. authorities, including Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, according to the statement. In a social media post last week, Trump said it was “my Great Honor to just meet with high-level Representatives of Switzerland. We discussed many subjects, including, and most importantly, Trade and Trade Imbalance.” He said Greer will “discuss the subjects further with Switzerland’s Leaders.” The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on who Trump met with. The Swiss government declined to comment, saying it’s up to the executives to disclose their involvement. The U.S. scrapped plans to impose tariffs on gold bars from Switzerland earlier this year after the proposal shocked global markets and threatened to disrupt supplies. Switzerland has recently proposed relocating some of its gold refining operations to the US as part of a bid to broker a broader trade deal. As part of these efforts, top Swiss trade diplomat Helene Budliger Artieda has made several trips to Washington in recent weeks. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Notably, this activity may comprise leveraged options and is scheduled for early next month. Sources noted that this report was legitimate after Pham acknowledged the announcement through a shared X post where she briefly said “True,” in response to an article released on Sunday, November 9. The move comes as the federal government is shut down, which has impacted other crypto policy efforts. It would move away from current US rules, which largely limit leveraged trading to derivatives, such as futures and perpetual contracts, rather than the actual crypto assets underlying them. Pham hints at the beginning of leveraged spot crypto trading Regarding the announcement that Pham acknowledged efforts to start leveraged spot crypto trading. Sources have pointed out that the news illustrates that the acting chair has been actively negotiating with CFTC-regulated designated contracts markets (DCMs) exchanges to reach an agreement. This group comprises leading financial firms like ICE Futures, CME, and Cboe Futures Exchange. Additionally, it includes crypto-focused companies such as Coinbase Derivatives, Kalshi prediction markets, and US-based Polymarket. Sources close to the situation indicated that their discussions focus on the launch of spot crypto trading products that involve leverage, financing options, and margin. As we work with Congress to further clarify these markets via new legislation, we are also using our existing authority to adopt the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Market s recommendations rapidly,” said Pham in a statement. Analysts noted that this crucial step marks a significant shift in the US regulators’ approach to managing crypto markets. For example, Pham is utilizing current regulations from the Commodity Exchange Act rather than waiting for Congress to grant the CFTC clear authority over spot crypto markets. Concerning the current regulations, it is worth noting that these rules highlight that retail trading of commodities with margin, financing, or leverage must be conducted on regulated exchanges. With leveraged spot crypto trading implemented, investors can borrow funds to boost their investment in digital currencies like Ether and Bitcoin. As a result, they could gain both substantial profits and larger losses. In this type of trading, participants typically issue part of the total trade value as collateral, known as margin, while the broker or exchange covers the remaining amount. For instance, if a trader uses 5x leverage, they could manage $5,000 worth of bitcoin by investing only $1,000 of their own cash. While these products have been available on international crypto exchanges for several years, sources acknowledge that providing them on CFTC-regulated platforms has an added advantage. It will introduce enhanced surveillance, risk management, and safeguard measures for investors for leveraged crypto trading in the US. Pham pushes leveraged spot crypto trading despite government shutdown The CFTC typically has five commissioners who come from diverse political origins. However, following the current situation, Pham is the only commissioner left, and the other positions remain vacant. This grants her more authority to lead the federal agency. Interestingly, Pham has not halted her efforts even as the government is in a shutdown that has held up the possibility of confirming Mike Selig, currently the chief counsel for the SEC’s Crypto Task Force and Trump’s pick to head that agency. Pham is expected to assume the role of global crypto payments company MoonPay’s chief legal officer and chief administrative officer after her time at the CFTC. However, sources discovered that the acting chair’s confirmation post did not mention plans about MoonPay. When reporters contacted Pham and the CFTC for comment on the situation, they did not respond immediately. Get seen where it counts.

This significant move pushes the market out of the extreme fear category for the first time in weeks, signaling a potential shift in investor confidence that could impact your trading decisions. What does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index actually measure? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a crucial barometer for market emotions. This innovative tool calculates sentiment across multiple dimensions to give traders a clear picture of market psychology. Understanding how this index works can help you make more informed investment choices during volatile periods. The index breaks down into six key components that together create a comprehensive sentiment score: Volatility (25%) – Measures price fluctuations Trading volume (25%) – Tracks market activity levels Social media mentions (15%) – Monitors online discussions Surveys (15%) – Gathers direct investor opinions Bitcoin dominance (10%) – Watches BTC’s market share Google search volume (10%) – Measures public interest Why should you care about the Crypto Fear & Greed Index movement? When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index moves from extreme fear to fear territory, it often signals changing market conditions. Historically, periods of extreme fear have presented buying opportunities for savvy investors. However, the current reading of 29 still suggests caution remains prevalent among market participants. This improvement in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index typically correlates with several market behaviors. For instance, we often see reduced selling pressure and increased accumulation during fear periods. Moreover, the transition from extreme fear can indicate that the market is finding a bottom, which might precede a more sustained recovery. How can you use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index in your strategy? The current Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading provides valuable context for your investment decisions. While the move to 29 shows improvement, remember that we’re still in fear territory. This suggests maintaining a balanced approach rather than making aggressive moves. Consider these actionable insights based on the current Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading: Dollar-cost average during fear periods Monitor key resistance levels for breakout confirmation Diversify your portfolio across different assets Set stop-loss orders to manage risk What historical patterns does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index reveal? Looking back at previous movements in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, we can identify interesting patterns. The transition from extreme fear to fear has often marked the beginning of recovery phases. However, each market cycle presents unique characteristics that require careful analysis.

While we’ve exited extreme fear territory, the journey toward greed and extreme greed remains ahead. This measured progress suggests cautious optimism is returning, but vigilance remains essential. Remember that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as one tool among many in your analytical toolkit. Combine its insights with fundamental analysis and technical indicators to build a comprehensive market view. The current reading encourages strategic positioning rather than emotional reactions. Frequently Asked Questions What is considered a good Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading? There’s no single ‘good’ reading, as different investors use the index differently. However, readings below 25 often indicate potential buying opportunities, while readings above 75 suggest caution might be warranted. How often does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index update? The index updates daily, providing fresh sentiment data that reflects the most recent market conditions and social media trends. Can the Crypto Fear & Greed Index predict price movements? While it doesn’t predict prices directly, extreme readings often coincide with market turning points. The index serves as a contrarian indicator at sentiment extremes. Why does Bitcoin dominance affect the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? Bitcoin dominance measures BTC’s market share relative to other cryptocurrencies. When dominance is high, it often indicates risk-off sentiment, while low dominance suggests altcoin speculation. How reliable is the social media component of the index? The social media metric captures sentiment trends rather than absolute accuracy. It works best when combined with other indicators in the index calculation. Should I make investment decisions based solely on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? No, the index should complement your research, not replace it. Always combine multiple analysis methods before making investment decisions. Found this analysis helpful?

Both of these companies share a major financial backer in Tether Holdings, and the takeover is expected to support Rumble’s effort to expand from video hosting into cloud infrastructure. The offer being discussed would give Northern Data shareholders fewer shares of Rumble than previously proposed, so the exchange ratio has changed from 2.319 Rumble shares for each Northern Data share to around 2 shares. The earlier plan had projected a combined company worth about $4.5 billion with Northern Data investors holding a third of the new entity. Due to declining stock prices on both sides, the combined valuation now sits near $2.9 billion. Stake terms adjusted and loan forgiveness included As part of the deal structure , Tether would forgo a significant portion of a €575 million loan issued to Northern Data. Confidence around Northern Data weakened after news that European prosecutors opened a criminal investigation into the company. Authorities are examining whether Northern Data purchased large quantities of GPUs for a facility in northern Sweden while claiming tax incentives meant for artificial intelligence computing. Investigators are reviewing whether those GPUs were actually used for crypto mining instead. The investigation pushed the company’s share price lower and intensified the urgency to resolve its financial position. Last week, Northern Data sold its mining division, Peak Mining, for up to $200 million. The buyer was not publicly identified, though individuals familiar with the matter said the buyer is also connected to Tether. The sale removes a unit that had drawn regulatory attention and allows Northern Data to focus on its cloud and high-performance computing operations ahead of the anticipated merger. Tether profit strength drives influence across sectors At the same time, Tether is reporting record financial performance. Paolo Ardoino, chief executive of Tether, said, “This year we’re going to approach another $15 billion profit. That’s very rare,” during remarks in Lugano at the Plan B Forum. USDT, the stablecoin issued by Tether, has around $183 billion in circulation and accounts for about 60% of the stablecoin market. Even with these profits, outside firms have expressed interest in investing. Talks have taken place about raising up to $20 billion in exchange for roughly a 3% stake, which would value Tether at around $500 billion. Paolo said many companies are approaching them, stating, “We have been contacted by an enormous amount of companies that want to invest in us. We have to draw a line in the sand on a valuation that we think is very cheap.” Tether is preparing to re-enter the United States later next year through a new stablecoin project called USAT that reportedly aligns with pro-crypto policies under President Donald Trump.

What Are the Challenges in Resolving the Government Shutdown? Despite Trump’s optimism, several hurdles remain. Political divisions often stall agreements, and compromises must address core issues like budget allocations and policy demands. Moreover, public pressure mounts as the shutdown drags on, making timely action essential. However, the reported partial deal indicates that lawmakers are willing to find common ground, which could pave the way for a full resolution.

This development comes as welcome relief to thousands of federal employees and marks a crucial step toward restoring normal government operations after weeks of uncertainty. What Does the Government Shutdown Agreement Include? The partial government shutdown deal emerged from negotiations between Senators Angus King, Jeanne Shaheen, and Maggie Hassan working with Republican colleagues. According to Politico reports, the agreement centers on a temporary spending bill that already passed the House on Sunday. This bill serves as the foundation for what could become a more comprehensive budget solution. Moreover, Senate Majority Leader John Thune has committed to providing Senate Democrats with a December vote on extending Affordable Care Act subsidies. This concession represents a key compromise in the government shutdown negotiations. How Will This Government Shutdown Resolution Affect Federal Workers? The immediate impact of this government shutdown agreement brings substantial relief to furloughed employees. Here’s what the deal means for them: Federal employees return to work immediately All unpaid wages will be provided Government services resume normal operations Uncertainty about paycheck timing ends This government shutdown resolution ensures that essential services can continue without further disruption. The return of federal workers means agencies can address backlogs that accumulated during the shutdown period. What Comes Next in the Government Shutdown Process? While this represents significant progress, the government shutdown solution remains partial. The Senate must still formalize the agreement through official voting procedures. Democrats will have additional opportunities to decide on votes for other policy extensions beyond the healthcare subsidies. The temporary nature of this government shutdown agreement means lawmakers will need to continue working toward a more permanent budget solution. However, this breakthrough demonstrates that bipartisan cooperation can produce results even in politically challenging circumstances. Why Does This Government Shutdown Resolution Matter? This government shutdown agreement matters beyond immediate political headlines. It shows that our democratic institutions can still function effectively when lawmakers prioritize practical solutions over partisan politics.

Frequently Asked Questions When will federal employees return to work? Federal employees will return to work immediately once the agreement is finalized and implemented. Will furloughed workers receive back pay? Yes, the agreement specifies that all furloughed employees will receive any unpaid wages from the shutdown period. What happens to the temporary spending bill? The Senate will vote on the temporary spending bill that passed the House, using it as a foundation for broader budget negotiations. Are the Affordable Care Act subsidies guaranteed? Senate Democrats have been promised a vote in December on extending the subsidies, but the outcome will depend on that vote. Is this a permanent solution to the government shutdown? This is a partial agreement that resolves the immediate shutdown but requires further work on a comprehensive budget deal. How long did the government shutdown last? The duration varied by agency, but this agreement ends the shutdown period for all affected government operations. Help spread this important news!

Major cryptocurrency projects are scheduled to release millions of dollars worth of tokens into circulation between November 10-16, with APT leading the way at $36.19 million. Understanding these token unlocks is crucial for any serious crypto investor looking to navigate market volatility. Why Should You Care About Token Unlocks? Token unlocks represent scheduled releases of previously locked cryptocurrency tokens into the market. These events can significantly impact prices and trading volumes. When large amounts of tokens become available, they often create selling pressure that affects market dynamics. However, smart investors use this information to make informed decisions about their portfolios. This Week’s Major Token Unlock Schedule The upcoming week features several substantial token unlocks across multiple blockchain projects. According to Tokenomist data, here are the key events you need to monitor: November 10 – LINEA: 2.88 billion tokens ($36.01 million) at 11:00 a.m. UTC November 11 – APT: 11.31 million tokens ($36.19 million) at 6:00 a.m. UTC November 13 – AVAX: 1.67 million tokens ($29.52 million) at 12:00 a.m. UTC – CHEEL: 20.81 million tokens ($13.73 million) at 12:00 a.m. UTC November 15 – CONX: 2.32 million tokens ($29.22 million) at 12:00 a.m. UTC – STRK: 127 million tokens ($18.79 million) at 12:00 a.m. UTC – WCT: 125 million tokens ($15.61 million) at 12:00 a.m. UTC – SEI: 55.56 million tokens ($10.14 million) at 12:00 p.m. UTC November 16 – ARB: 92.65 million tokens ($27.63 million) at 1:00 p.m. UTC How Do Token Unlocks Affect Market Prices? These token unlock events create both risks and opportunities for investors. When tokens become available, early investors and team members might sell their holdings, potentially driving prices down. However, well-managed projects often see these events as milestones that bring more liquidity and participation to their ecosystems. The percentage of circulating supply being unlocked is particularly important. For example, WCT’s unlock represents 65.21% of its circulating supply, which could have a massive impact compared to APT’s 0.49% release. Strategic Approaches to Token Unlock Events Smart investors don’t just watch these token unlocks – they plan around them. Some traders use these events to enter positions at potentially lower prices, while others might temporarily reduce exposure to affected assets. The key is understanding each project’s fundamentals and how the unlock aligns with its development roadmap. Monitoring token unlock calendars should be part of every crypto investor’s routine. These scheduled events provide predictable market-moving catalysts that can be factored into trading strategies and long-term investment plans. What Makes This Week’s Token Unlocks Significant? This week stands out due to the concentration of major token unlocks across multiple prominent projects. The combined value exceeds $200 million, representing one of the most active unlock weeks in recent memory. The diversity of projects involved – from layer-1 blockchains to gaming tokens – means the impact will be felt across multiple cryptocurrency sectors. FAQs About Token Unlocks What exactly are token unlocks? Token unlocks refer to scheduled releases of cryptocurrency tokens that were previously locked or vested, making them available for trading or selling. Why do projects schedule token unlocks? Projects use token unlocks to gradually release tokens to team members, investors, and advisors while maintaining price stability during early stages. How do token unlocks affect prices? Token unlocks often create selling pressure as recipients may cash out, potentially causing temporary price declines before markets absorb the new supply. Should I sell before a token unlock? This depends on the project’s fundamentals, the unlock size relative to circulating supply, and your investment strategy – there’s no one-size-fits-all answer. Where can I find token unlock schedules? Platforms like Tokenomist, CoinMarketCap, and project official documentation provide comprehensive token unlock calendars. Do all token unlocks cause price drops? Not necessarily – well-communicated unlocks in fundamentally strong projects sometimes have minimal impact or can even be bullish if demand exceeds new supply.

The latest data reveals the Altcoin Season Index currently stands at 31, sparking important questions about market direction and investment opportunities. This crucial metric serves as your compass in the volatile cryptocurrency landscape. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index acts as a powerful thermometer measuring market sentiment. Created by CoinMarketCap, this innovative tool compares the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies against Bitcoin over 90 days. However, it excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens to provide a pure measurement of market dynamics. When this index hits 75 or higher, we officially enter an altcoin season. This means at least 75% of major altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin during the measurement period. Currently sitting at 31, we’re clearly in Bitcoin-dominated territory, but the index provides valuable clues about potential shifts ahead. Why Should You Care About This Number? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index gives you a strategic advantage in portfolio management. Here’s what the current reading tells us: Bitcoin dominance continues – Most altcoins are underperforming BTC Potential accumulation phase – Lower prices may present buying opportunities Early warning system – Rising index values signal changing market conditions Risk assessment tool – Helps gauge when to shift between BTC and altcoins How Can You Use This Information Strategically? The current Altcoin Season Index reading of 31 suggests several actionable insights for savvy investors. First, recognize that we’re still in a Bitcoin-led market cycle. This means your portfolio should maintain significant Bitcoin exposure while selectively accumulating promising altcoins at discounted prices. Monitor the index weekly for any upward movement. A consistent climb above 50 could signal the early stages of an altcoin season approaching. Many successful investors use these transition periods to rebalance their holdings before major price movements occur. What Historical Patterns Reveal About Future Movements Historical data shows that the Altcoin Season Index typically moves in cycles. Periods of Bitcoin dominance often precede explosive altcoin rallies. The current low reading might actually represent a prime opportunity for strategic positioning. Previous cycles demonstrate that when the index rapidly climbs from low levels, the resulting altcoin season can generate substantial returns for early investors. However, timing remains challenging, which is why gradual accumulation during low-index periods often proves most effective. Key Takeaways for Your Investment Strategy The Altcoin Season Index at 31 delivers a clear message: patience and preparation are essential. While we’re not in altcoin season yet, the groundwork is being laid for potential future opportunities. Use this time to research fundamentally strong projects and establish entry points that align with your risk tolerance. Remember that successful cryptocurrency investing requires both discipline and timing. The index provides valuable data, but your personal strategy should consider multiple factors including project fundamentals, market sentiment, and overall portfolio goals. Frequently Asked Questions What triggers an altcoin season? Altcoin seasons typically occur when market confidence expands beyond Bitcoin, often driven by new technological developments, increased institutional interest in alternative cryptocurrencies, or Bitcoin price stability that encourages investors to seek higher returns elsewhere. How often does the Altcoin Season Index update? The index updates regularly on CoinMarketCap, typically reflecting the most recent 90-day performance data. For the most current readings, check the platform directly. Should I sell my Bitcoin when altcoin season arrives? Not necessarily. Many investors maintain Bitcoin exposure while allocating a portion of their portfolio to altcoins during these periods. Diversification helps manage risk while capturing potential upside. Can the index predict exact timing of altcoin seasons? While the Altcoin Season Index indicates conditions, it cannot predict exact timing. Use it as one tool among many in your market analysis toolkit. What other indicators should I watch with this index? Combine the Altcoin Season Index with Bitcoin dominance charts, trading volume analysis, and fundamental project research for comprehensive market understanding. How long do altcoin seasons typically last? Historical altcoin seasons have varied from several weeks to multiple months, depending on market conditions and broader economic factors.

According to whale on-chain movement, XRP whales are not leaving the market, they are actually investing in a new crypto coin called Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . With a price of only $0.035, Mutuum Finance is one of the most popular new coins currently circulating within the crypto market because of its DeFi lending mechanism and real yield system and growth rate for the new crypto coin. With Stage 6 of its presale already being 85% sold, Mutuum Finance is one of the top candidates for next crypto to explode for Q4 of this year and into 2026 because demand is escalating at a rate that defies estimates and predictions currently available on market research platforms available online today. XRP Price Pressure Intensifies XRP has had a tough week, falling more than 10% as it maintains its tight range between $2.16 and $2.52, exactly on the Fibonacci support level of 0.382. While efforts are being made by bulls to protect this region, presently, however, XRP is finding it tough to move past its EMA resistance levels, thereby preventing it from moving up significantly. To get its momentum back, XRP would need to get past its present resistance of $2.52, potentially opening up a way towards $2.77-$3.10. But if this resistance is not negated, then forecasts point towards a possible fall towards $1.94. However, one thing that is keeping market participants up is that open interest is increasing, thereby foretelling that soon a huge volatility is due, though whether it would be up or down is still unclear. It is this kind of uncertainty that has made many investors, who would have liked more predictable upside potential, look towards Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a relatively better growth option at this point of time, positioning it as the next crypto to explode. Mutuum Finance presale enters fresh growth phase Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still gathering pace across the DeFi space as it nears its final stages of presale. Mutuum Finance is currently at an advanced stage of completion at 85% of Phase 6, indicating that this is one of the most engaged projects in DeFi that has emerged recently on a decentralized finance platform. At this point, at a price of $0.035 for Phase 6, investors have a final opportunity before investing, as it is expected that this presale is set to soar as soon as it enters Phase 7, at a price of $0.04 per token. Mutuum Finance has received more than 17,810 supporters and has reached more than $18.5 million in presale funding. That, however, is not all, as Mutuum Finance’s attractiveness lies in its utility-focused model, development roadmap, and emphasis on establishing a transparent and sustainable lending platform. With this basic framework, Mutuum Finance remains the new crypto coin to buy, having carved its niche within a competitive market. Imminent testnet launch for core DeFi functionality Additionally, one of the most notable milestones is expected in Q4 of 2025, and that will be when they roll out their test network, Sepolia, and this project brings about the first live environment that incorporates the Mutuum Finance loaning and value creation system. Users will be able to obtain funding by providing collateral through ETH and USDT, and they can earn more value through their mtTokens that earn them MUTM rewards. Additionally, Mutuum Finance will be able to test and develop other essential operating functions on its testnet, such as risk management, rate of interest, as well as loan algorithms, before fully implementing them on its mainnet platform as a result of its testnet opening. All these measures demonstrate Mutuum Finance’s focused attention to its longevity and success on its platform. While excitement and anticipation continue to build, Mutuum Finance is being looked at as one of the projects that is set for considerable growth and development within the DeFi space, thereby making MUTM one of the cryptos that need close monitoring as the market approaches its next crypto to explode, and solidifying it as the next crypto to explode in the upcoming cycle.

This nightmare became reality for South Korean personality Han Hye-jin, whose channel was hijacked and deleted after broadcasting a fraudulent cryptocurrency live stream. The incident highlights growing security threats in the crypto space that can impact even established creators. What Exactly Happened in This XRP Hack? Early on July 10, Han Hye-jin’s YouTube channel began airing a suspicious live stream titled “Ripple (XRP): CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s Growth Forecast.” The broadcast, which had comments disabled, falsely claimed to feature Ripple’s CEO discussing market insights and XRP strategies. This XRP hack represents a sophisticated social engineering attack that exploited both the channel’s credibility and viewers’ interest in cryptocurrency news. How Do These Cryptocurrency Hacks Occur? Cybercriminals typically use phishing techniques to gain access to YouTube accounts. They might send fake login alerts or partnership offers that trick creators into revealing their credentials. Once inside, hackers can: Change channel passwords and recovery options Delete existing content and upload fraudulent streams Disable comments to prevent viewer warnings Promote fake cryptocurrency giveaways or investments The XRP hack on Han Hye-jin’s channel followed this pattern precisely, using Ripple’s reputation to lend credibility to their scam. Why Are Crypto-Related Channels Targeted? Cryptocurrency channels attract substantial attention from investors seeking quick profits and market insights. Hackers capitalize on this enthusiasm by: Leveraging established trust in popular creators Exploiting FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) among viewers Using technical jargon that confuses less experienced investors Promising unrealistic returns or exclusive opportunities The recent XRP hack demonstrates how attackers manipulate both platform vulnerabilities and psychological triggers. What Can Content Creators Learn From This XRP Hack? This incident serves as a crucial warning for all digital creators. Implement these security measures immediately: Enable two-factor authentication on all accounts Use unique, strong passwords for each platform Verify suspicious emails through official channels Regularly monitor account activity and connected devices Educate team members about phishing attempts Proactive security could have prevented this devastating XRP hack and channel deletion. How Can Viewers Protect Themselves From Similar Scams? Cryptocurrency enthusiasts must remain vigilant when consuming online content. Always: Verify unusual streams through official social media accounts Be skeptical of promises offering guaranteed returns Research investment opportunities independently Report suspicious content to platform moderators immediately Remember that legitimate companies rarely promote through hacked channels The XRP hack incident reminds us that if an opportunity seems too good to be true, it probably is. What Does This Mean For Cryptocurrency Security? This XRP hack represents a broader trend of digital security challenges in the crypto space. As blockchain technology evolves, so do the methods criminals use to exploit it. The incident underscores the importance of: Platform-level security improvements from companies like YouTube Increased creator education about digital safety practices Collaboration between crypto projects and content platforms Transparent communication during security incidents Ultimately, protecting digital assets requires vigilance from all parties involved. Frequently Asked Questions How did hackers access Han Hye-jin’s YouTube channel? While the exact method remains unconfirmed, similar incidents typically involve phishing attacks where creators unknowingly provide login credentials through fake security alerts or partnership offers. Can deleted YouTube channels be recovered? Sometimes, if reported quickly enough. However, recovery depends on YouTube’s policies and the extent of damage. Immediate reporting to YouTube support offers the best chance. What makes cryptocurrency channels particularly vulnerable? Their audience often includes investors seeking quick information, making them more likely to engage with fraudulent investment schemes promoted through hacked channels. How can I identify a hacked YouTube stream? Look for red flags like disabled comments, unusual streaming times, promises of guaranteed returns, and content that doesn’t match the channel’s typical style. Has Ripple commented on this incident? As of publication, Ripple hasn’t issued an official statement, but companies typically distance themselves from unauthorized uses of their executives’ names and branding. Are there legal consequences for these hackers? Yes, unauthorized computer access, fraud, and impersonation carry serious legal penalties, though international jurisdiction complicates prosecution.

The company, founded in Paris in 2014, has reported record revenues in 2025, reaching triple-digit millions, driven by both individual and institutional demand. CEO Pascal Gauthier told the Financial Times that this year has been the company’s strongest yet, as hackers increasingly target digital assets. “We’re being hacked more and more every day … hacking of your bank accounts, of your crypto, and it’s not going to get better next year and the year after that,” he said. Crypto Thefts Hit New Highs The surge in Ledger sales coincides with a record year for crypto-related thefts. According to Chainalysis, hackers stole $2.2 billion worth of digital assets in the first half of 2025, surpassing the total losses recorded in all of 2024. Approximately 23% of these attacks targeted individual wallets, highlighting the growing need for secure hardware solutions. Ledger Secures $100 Billion in Bitcoin Gauthier revealed that Ledger currently secures around $100 billion worth of Bitcoin for its customers. He also suggested that the company may benefit from seasonal spikes in sales during Black Friday and the Christmas period. Looking ahead, Ledger plans to raise funds in 2026, either through a private funding round or a US listing. The company is increasing its New York headcount, with Gauthier noting, “money is in New York today for crypto, it’s nowhere else in the world, it’s certainly not in Europe.” Competitors such as Trezor and Tangem offer similar “cold storage” wallets, but Ledger remains the market leader. The company was last valued at $1.5 billion in 2023, with backing from 10T Holdings and True Global Ventures. Multisig App Upgrade Sparks Debate Last month, Ledger launched a new multisignature (multisig) interface, receiving mixed reactions from its user base, as reported by Bitzuma . While many praised the upgrade as a technical improvement, the new fee structure—including a $10 flat fee per transaction and a 0.05% variable fee for token transfers—drew criticism. Developers such as pcaversaccio accused Ledger of moving away from its Cypherpunk roots, arguing the app has become a centralized “choke point” aimed at extracting revenue from users.",Crypto News|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|WALLET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-11-10 01:54:18

In his recent social media analysis, Hayes made a compelling Bitcoin surge prediction that has the crypto community buzzing with excitement and anticipation. Why This Bitcoin Surge Prediction Matters Now Arthur Hayes, the visionary behind BitMEX, dropped a bombshell on social media platform X. He declared that the U.S. government has returned to its primary business of printing money and distributing benefits. This monetary policy shift, according to Hayes, will directly fuel a significant price increase for both Bitcoin and privacy-focused cryptocurrency ZEC. Hayes’s analysis comes at a critical time when investors are searching for reliable indicators in the volatile crypto market. His track record in the cryptocurrency space lends substantial credibility to this Bitcoin surge prediction , making it essential reading for anyone involved in digital assets. How Money Printing Powers Cryptocurrency Growth When governments increase money supply through quantitative easing or stimulus programs, several key effects typically follow: Traditional currency devaluation occurs Investors seek inflation-resistant assets Cryptocurrencies become attractive alternatives Digital gold narratives gain strength This economic environment creates perfect conditions for Hayes’s Bitcoin surge prediction to materialize. Historically, periods of aggressive money printing have correlated strongly with cryptocurrency price increases. What Makes ZEC Part of This Surge Prediction? While Bitcoin often dominates cryptocurrency discussions, Hayes specifically included ZEC in his analysis. Zcash offers enhanced privacy features that appeal to investors concerned about financial surveillance. As monetary policies become more invasive, privacy-focused cryptocurrencies may experience disproportionate growth. The dual focus in this Bitcoin surge prediction highlights how different cryptocurrency segments can benefit from the same macroeconomic trends. Investors should consider diversifying across both established and specialized digital assets. Actionable Insights From This Analysis How can investors position themselves based on this Bitcoin surge prediction ? Consider these strategic approaches: Dollar-cost average into Bitcoin positions Research privacy coin fundamentals Monitor Federal Reserve announcements Set realistic profit-taking targets Remember that while Hayes’s analysis provides valuable insight, cryptocurrency investments always carry risk. Never invest more than you can afford to lose, and consider consulting with financial professionals. The Bigger Picture: Cryptocurrency as Monetary Hedge This Bitcoin surge prediction reinforces cryptocurrency’s evolving role in global finance. As traditional monetary systems face stress tests, digital assets increasingly serve as: Inflation protection mechanisms Borderless value transfer systems Financial sovereignty tools Technological innovation platforms The current economic climate may accelerate adoption across all these use cases, potentially validating Hayes’s optimistic outlook. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly did Arthur Hayes predict? Arthur Hayes predicted that both Bitcoin and ZEC will experience significant price increases due to resumed money printing by the U.S. government. Why does money printing affect cryptocurrency prices? Increased money supply typically devalues traditional currency, making limited-supply assets like Bitcoin more attractive as stores of value. How reliable are cryptocurrency price predictions? While experts like Hayes provide valuable analysis, cryptocurrency markets remain highly volatile and unpredictable. Always conduct your own research. Should I invest based on this prediction? Use expert predictions as one data point among many in your investment research. Never make financial decisions based solely on any single analysis. What makes ZEC different from Bitcoin? Zcash offers enhanced privacy features through zero-knowledge proofs, while Bitcoin transactions are publicly visible on the blockchain. When does Hayes expect this surge to happen? Hayes didn’t specify exact timing, focusing instead on the causal relationship between money printing and cryptocurrency valuation increases.

During an interview on CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday, November 9, Hassett noted that the lack of air traffic controllers is causing significant travel disruptions as Thanksgiving approaches. “Thanksgiving is one of the busiest times of the year for the economy… and if people can’t travel during that period, we could see a negative quarter for the fourth quarter,” the White House economic adviser explained . Flight delays in the US hinder traveling as Thanksgiving approaches On Sunday, US-based airlines canceled over 2,200 flights, raising concerns among passengers. To address these concerns, the country’s Secretary of Transportation, Sean Duffy, cautioned that air travel will slow down to a “trickle” because air traffic control was experiencing staffing shortages as Thanksgiving draws near. He attributed this situation to the ongoing federal shutdown. His statement came after several airlines reportedly faced their third consecutive day of mandatory flight cuts due to delays and cancellations that interfered with travel schedules on Saturday, November 8. Notably, the federal shutdown has lasted 40 days , resulting in a shortage of air traffic controllers, who, like other federal employees, have not received pay for weeks. “It’s only going to get worse… during the two weeks before Thanksgiving, you’ll see air travel drop significantly,” Duffy stated on CNN’s “State of the Union.” These US flight delays have disrupted the plans of millions of individuals, as most of them had preferred to travel before Thanksgiving. This event is one of the significant holidays in the country, taking place on November 27 this year. Still, Duffy warned that many individuals will be unable to board airplanes as there will be insufficient flights if this situation remains unchanged. Following his remarks, analysts noted that Sunday was the worst day for flight cancellations since the shutdown kicked off on October 1. Meanwhile, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has instructed airlines to reduce their daily flights by 4% starting this Friday. This order will be enforced at 40 major airports because of safety concerns regarding air traffic control. Sources mentioned that these flight cutbacks are set to escalate to 6% on Tuesday and reach 10% by November 14. Following the FAA’s instructions, many airlines have already made their cancellations for the upcoming days public. For example, United Airlines shared its intention to cancel 190 flights on Monday and 269 on Tuesday, according to the company. The ongoing federal shutdown raises tension in the airline industry On Sunday, 4:20 p.m. ET (2120 GMT), at least 2,215 US flights had been cancelled and more than 7,200 delayed as conditions worsened, according to FlightAware, a flight tracking website. Additionally, the FAA reported that 12 control towers experienced staffing issues earlier. Apart from these challenges, Duffy highlighted that more air traffic controllers have retired since the federal shutdown started on October 1. This was after he told reporters that the FAA is short about 1,000 to 2,000 controllers for full staffing. He further explained that he paid skilled controllers to perform their task and not retire. According to him, he had about four controllers retiring per day before the shutdown, and now the number has increased to around 15 to 20 per day. On Saturday alone, approximately 1,550 flights were canceled and 6,700 were delayed. That was up from 1,025 cancellations and 7,000 delays reported on Friday. Sources close to the situation mentioned that Airline officials privately stated that they could schedule and plan very few flights because several were delayed. They expressed worry about how the system would function if staffing problems further deteriorate. Meanwhile, the Senate is moving toward a deal to reopen the government, which would fund operations through January 2026.

That’s exactly what the Bank of Korea is proposing in their groundbreaking new approach to bank-led stablecoins . This strategic move could reshape how we think about digital money and financial stability. Why Is the Bank of Korea Pushing for Bank-Led Stablecoins? The Bank of Korea recently released a white paper that makes a compelling case for bank-led stablecoins as the future of digital currency. Their recommendation centers on having banks take the lead in stablecoin issuance rather than allowing non-bank entities to dominate this emerging market. This approach directly contrasts with current U.S. policy under the Trump administration. What makes this development particularly interesting is the Bank of Korea’s reliance on Biden-era financial policy. They specifically cited the U.S. President’s Working Group on Financial Markets report from the previous administration to support their position. This creates an intriguing international dialogue about how different countries approach cryptocurrency regulation. How Do Bank-Led Stablecoins Differ from Current Models? Traditional stablecoins typically come from cryptocurrency companies or fintech startups. However, bank-led stablecoins would operate differently in several key ways: Enhanced regulatory oversight through existing banking frameworks Built-in consumer protections that banks already provide Seamless integration with traditional financial systems Proven risk management practices from established institutions Greater financial stability through centralized oversight This model addresses many concerns that regulators have about privately-issued stablecoins, including reserve transparency and systemic risk. What Challenges Might Bank-Led Stablecoins Face? While the bank-led stablecoins approach offers significant benefits, it also faces several hurdles. Traditional banks may struggle with the technological innovation required for digital currency systems. Additionally, there are concerns about whether banks can move quickly enough to compete with agile crypto startups. Another challenge involves international coordination. Since cryptocurrencies operate across borders, different regulatory approaches could create friction in global markets. The Bank of Korea’s proposal highlights how countries are taking varied paths toward regulating digital assets. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors and Users? The push for bank-led stablecoins represents a significant shift in how governments view digital currencies. For users, this could mean: More stable and reliable digital payment options Better consumer protection mechanisms Easier integration between crypto and traditional banking Increased regulatory clarity for digital assets This development suggests that major financial institutions are taking cryptocurrencies seriously and want to play a central role in their evolution. How Might This Impact Global Crypto Regulation? The Bank of Korea’s position on bank-led stablecoins could influence other countries considering their own digital currency frameworks. As one of Asia’s leading economies, South Korea’s regulatory approach often sets precedents for neighboring nations. Moreover, the reference to U.S. policy shows how international regulatory discussions are shaping local decisions. This creates an interesting dynamic where countries learn from each other’s experiences with cryptocurrency regulation. Conclusion: The Future of Stablecoins Is Evolving The Bank of Korea’s advocacy for bank-led stablecoins marks a pivotal moment in cryptocurrency history. By leveraging Biden-era financial policy while adapting it to local needs, they’re creating a hybrid approach that balances innovation with stability. This could become a model for other nations seeking to regulate digital assets without stifling their potential. As the debate continues between bank-centric and open models, one thing is clear: stablecoins are becoming too important to leave unregulated. The question isn’t whether they’ll be regulated, but how—and the Bank of Korea has just made a powerful case for their preferred approach. Frequently Asked Questions What are bank-led stablecoins? Bank-led stablecoins are digital currencies issued and managed by traditional banking institutions rather than cryptocurrency companies or fintech startups. Why does the Bank of Korea prefer bank-led stablecoins? The Bank of Korea believes banks offer better consumer protection, regulatory oversight, and financial stability compared to non-bank issuers. How does this differ from U.S. policy? Current U.S. policy under the Trump administration allows non-bank entities to issue stablecoins, while the Bank of Korea wants to restrict issuance to banks. What policy did the Bank of Korea reference? They cited the U.S. President’s Working Group on Financial Markets report from the Biden administration that recommended bank-centric approaches. When might we see bank-led stablecoins in South Korea? There’s no specific timeline yet, but the white paper suggests the Bank of Korea is seriously considering this regulatory framework. Will this affect existing stablecoins? Existing stablecoins might need to adapt to new regulations or partner with banks if the Bank of Korea’s proposal becomes law. Found this analysis insightful?

Smart buyers are strongly pursuing transparency and sustainable growth models. Recent news surrounding Solana’s (SOL) price target and Hyperliquid’s (HYPE) price prediction have created strong optimism for the best crypto to buy right now moving into 2026. Solana’s ETF launch and Hyperliquid’s buyback momentum are securing institutional confidence even amidst volatile market conditions. Amid these significant developments, BlockDAG (BDAG) has become the main focus. Its presale is currently in Batch 32, priced at $0.005. Special price in batch 32, and has already secured $435M+ raised. Under its new Value Era framework, the project is changing its entire coin distribution model. Solana: The $210 Target Fueled by Institutional ETF Inflows Solana has maintained impressive growth following the announcement of the Bitwise Solana Staking ETF debut on the New York Stock Exchange. Analysts believe this development could push Solana’s (SOL) price target toward $210 very soon. This is supported by solid institutional money flowing in and active community demand. As one of the most bullish assets, Solana remains a focal point for those seeking exposure to high-speed blockchain networks. SOL currently trades near $202. Its market cap is over $111 billion, and its 24-hour volume exceeds $14 billion. These numbers show accelerating market engagement. Analysts note a bullish technical setup. This is supported by the MACD and RSI indicators, which signal a strong footing above the $190 price range. While Solana’s immediate outlook is very promising, a comparison with newer ecosystems like BlockDAG and Hyperliquid highlights a growing preference for sustainable, scarcity-driven growth models. Hyperliquid: Buyback Program Anchors Market Stability Hyperliquid’s (HYPE) price prediction holds steady near $48. This follows a volatile trading week. Despite market tension, sentiment remains positive. This is thanks to Hyperliquid’s reliable fee revenue and its ongoing $644 million buyback program. This program aims to reduce the circulating coin supply. This strategic approach has strengthened HYPE’s position as one of the best crypto to buy right now in the decentralized derivatives sector. The recent HIP-3 upgrade has boosted on-chain utility. It allows developers to launch perpetual markets through staking 500,000 HYPE. Data from DeFiLlama reports over $111 million in monthly fees and $98.9 million in holder revenue. This reflects strong network performance. Technically, Hyperliquid’s (HYPE) price prediction shows a neutral-to-bullish trend. The RSI is near 58, and the Bollinger Bands are tightening. This suggests a potential breakout above $48 toward the $52 resistance zone. BlockDAG’s Value Era Show Structure & Scarcity BlockDAG’s Value Era marks a decisive shift toward mainnet activation and exchange readiness. The price is $0.005. Special price in batch 32. It has successfully secured $435M+ raised. The project has moved away from bonuses toward a fully transparent, vesting-based model. Each purchase now releases 40% of coins immediately. The remaining 60% is distributed evenly over three months. This structure dramatically improves credibility. It supports liquidity and shows a long-term approach that appeals to serious buyers. CEO Anthony Turner confirmed that 4.3B coins remaining are allocated for this final presale stage. This is supported by an $86 million institutional commitment. The Presale is ending soon. This fixed timeline creates predictability and accountability in a market often defined by uncertainty. A massive 75% reduction in earlier bonus coins has capped the presale supply at 50 billion coins. This strongly reinforces a scarcity-based model. This disciplined structure gives BlockDAG a measurable advantage in maturity and transparency. For those tracking Hyperliquid’s and Solana’s progress, BlockDAG’s Value Era stands apart as a benchmark of stability and institutional confidence. Final Thoughts While Solana (SOL) and Hyperliquid (HYPE) are attracting attention through ETF momentum and buyback plans, they still rely on short-term market sentiment. Their growth outlook is strong, but volatility and regulatory uncertainty remain. In sharp contrast, BlockDAG’s Value Era represents strategic clarity. For $0.005 Special price in batch 32 with $435M+ raised, the project is anchored in transparency and fairness. Its vesting plan and reduced coin supply establish it as the best crypto to buy right now for 2026 and beyond. This is a project built to withstand market cycles while offering long-term value to smart traders.

Recent analysis reveals a dramatic transformation that every crypto investor should understand. The Ethereum market has undergone a fundamental shift from its traditional spot-driven structure to becoming highly speculative, creating new challenges and opportunities for traders. What Exactly Changed in the Ethereum Market? CryptoQuant contributor Darkfost’s analysis shows the Ethereum market has completely transformed its trading dynamics. Previously, Ethereum trading was dominated by spot market activity, which created more stable and sustainable bull runs. However, the current environment prioritizes quick profits over long-term stability. This shift matters because it affects everyone involved in the Ethereum market. The change impacts price stability, investment strategies, and risk management approaches for both retail and institutional participants. How Speculative Has the Ethereum Market Become? The data reveals astonishing growth in speculative activity. Current open interest and trading volumes for ETH have reached unprecedented levels that dwarf previous cycles. Consider these eye-opening statistics: Binance’s ETH trading volume surpassed $6 trillion this year alone This represents a two to threefold increase from the previous year Binance’s ETH open interest exceeded $12.5 billion as of August This is approximately five times higher than the previous all-time high of $2.5 billion set in November 2021 Why Does This Ethereum Market Shift Matter to You? The increased speculation in the Ethereum market creates both risks and opportunities. Higher volatility means potentially larger gains but also greater losses. The shift from spot-driven to speculative trading indicates changing market psychology where quick profits dominate investment decisions. This transformation affects how you should approach the Ethereum market. Traditional buy-and-hold strategies might need adjustment, while risk management becomes increasingly crucial in this new environment. What Can We Learn From This Ethereum Market Analysis? The data clearly indicates that the current Ethereum market cycle operates differently from previous ones. The exceptional speculation and increased volatility require investors to adapt their strategies. Understanding these market structure changes helps you make more informed decisions about your Ethereum investments. Moreover, recognizing these patterns in the Ethereum market can help you anticipate potential price movements and manage your exposure more effectively during both bullish and bearish phases. Navigating the New Ethereum Market Reality The Ethereum market’s transformation from spot-driven to highly speculative represents a significant evolution in cryptocurrency trading. While this brings new opportunities for profit, it also introduces increased risks that require careful navigation. Successful participation in today’s Ethereum market demands awareness of these structural changes and adaptation to the new trading environment. By understanding these dynamics, you can better position yourself for whatever comes next in this rapidly evolving space. Frequently Asked Questions What does ‘spot-driven market’ mean for Ethereum? A spot-driven Ethereum market means trading is primarily based on actual cryptocurrency purchases and sales rather than derivatives or leverage. This typically creates more stable and sustainable price movements. How does speculative trading affect Ethereum prices? Speculative trading increases volatility in the Ethereum market, leading to larger price swings in both directions. This can create opportunities for quick profits but also increases risk for investors. What is open interest in cryptocurrency trading? Open interest represents the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, such as futures and options, that haven’t been settled. High open interest often indicates increased speculative activity in the Ethereum market. Should I change my Ethereum investment strategy? While every investor’s situation differs, the increased speculation in the Ethereum market suggests reviewing your risk management strategies and considering whether your current approach aligns with the new market dynamics. How reliable is this Ethereum market analysis? The analysis comes from CryptoQuant, a reputable on-chain analytics platform, using verifiable trading data from major exchanges like Binance, making it a credible assessment of current Ethereum market conditions. Will the Ethereum market return to spot-driven trading? Market structures evolve continuously. While the current Ethereum market shows high speculation, future developments in regulation, technology, or investor behavior could shift the balance back toward spot trading dominance.

The suspension begins precisely at 9:00 a.m. UTC on July 19, giving traders limited time to prepare. Why is Upbit Implementing This AVAX Suspension? The primary reason behind this temporary Upbit AVAX suspension is a scheduled network upgrade for the Avalanche blockchain. Network upgrades are essential maintenance procedures that enhance: Security features and protocol improvements Transaction speed and network efficiency Overall system stability and performance Therefore, exchanges like Upbit must temporarily pause services to ensure a smooth transition and protect user assets during the upgrade process. What Exactly Does This Suspension Mean for You? During the Upbit AVAX suspension period, users cannot perform several key functions. Understanding these limitations helps you plan accordingly and avoid unexpected disruptions to your trading strategy. Deposits halted : You cannot transfer AVAX into your Upbit wallet Withdrawals paused : Moving AVAX out of Upbit becomes impossible Trading continues : Importantly, AVAX trading pairs remain active Other assets unaffected : Only AVAX services experience interruption How Long Will This Upbit AVAX Suspension Last? Upbit has not specified an exact end date for the Upbit AVAX suspension , which is common practice during network upgrades. The duration typically depends on how quickly the Avalanche development team completes the upgrade and when exchanges can safely resume operations. However, based on historical patterns, such suspensions usually last between 2-12 hours. Upbit will announce the resumption of services through their official channels once they confirm network stability. What Should You Do Before the Suspension Starts? Smart traders prepare in advance. Here are actionable steps to take before the Upbit AVAX suspension begins at 9:00 a.m. UTC on July 19: Complete any pending AVAX transfers immediately Plan your trading strategy around the suspension window Monitor Upbit’s official announcements for updates Consider setting price alerts for AVAX during this period Diversify your trading activities to other unaffected assets Is This Upbit AVAX Suspension Cause for Concern? Absolutely not. Temporary suspensions for network upgrades demonstrate Upbit’s commitment to security and operational excellence. The Upbit AVAX suspension follows standard industry practices that prioritize user asset protection above all else. Moreover, such upgrades typically bring valuable improvements that benefit the entire Avalanche ecosystem in the long run. The temporary inconvenience leads to enhanced network performance and security for all users. Key Takeaways from the Upbit Announcement The Upbit AVAX suspension represents a routine maintenance procedure rather than an emergency situation. Remember these crucial points: This is a planned, temporary measure for network improvement Only AVAX deposits and withdrawals are affected Trading of AVAX pairs continues uninterrupted The suspension begins July 19 at 9:00 a.m. UTC Normal operations resume after upgrade completion Network upgrades, while temporarily disruptive, ultimately strengthen the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The Upbit AVAX suspension demonstrates the exchange’s proactive approach to maintaining robust infrastructure and protecting user assets.

Only deposits and withdrawals are temporarily paused. Will my existing AVAX holdings be safe during the upgrade? Absolutely. Your AVAX assets remain secure in your Upbit wallet. The suspension only affects moving funds in or out of the platform. How will I know when the suspension ends? Upbit will make an official announcement through their website and social media channels once services resume. Enable notifications to stay updated. Can I use other exchanges for AVAX during this time? Yes, other exchanges supporting Avalanche will continue normal operations unless they announce their own maintenance schedules. Why don’t exchanges schedule these during low-traffic hours?

The Financial Services Commission (FSC) plans to submit a government sponsored bill by the end of 2025. It will join five other competing stablecoin bills under review in the National Assembly which have been submitted by individual lawmakers. Meanwhile, the Bank of Korea (BOK), which released a stablecoin whitepaper on October 27, stressed that “currency functions on trust rather than technology,” and is also seeking a role in licensing and monitoring. Legislative chaos Competing proposals have muddled the stablecoin policy landscape. “Most of the bills in the National Assembly envision a licensing regime for private stablecoin issuers,” said Sejin Kim, a fintech policy analyst at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. “The central bank, on the other hand, wants to keep issuance in the hands of banks over concerns about financial stability.” The FSC views stablecoins as part of the virtual asset market and maintains that licensing, exchange oversight, and custody supervision should remain within its jurisdiction. While all the bills share the same overarching objective none of them fully align with either the FSC’s or the BOK’s preferred model, explained J eonghwan JK Kim, an attorney specializing in digital assets at Architect Legal Advisory. The kimchi premium spreads to stablecoins The newly elected President Jae-Myung Lee expressed concerns that South Koreans are too reliant on USD backed assets. USD pegged stablecoins USDC and USDT dominate Korea’s crypto market. According to the BOK, the total trading volume of USD pegged stablecoins reached 56.95 trillion won ($41.6 billion) in the first quarter of 2025, marking a threefold increase from 17.06 trillion won in the third quarter of 2024. But Korean investors are paying more for USDT and USDC than investors abroad. The price gap, referred to as the “kimchi premium,” stems from high user demand and capital restrictions that make it harder for traders to move money in and out of the country. The price hike was initially observed in the 2017 Bitcoin bull run where prices soared as high as 30% and has now spread to stablecoins. Pro-crypto president President Lee pledged to transform the country into a digital asset hub. His election campaign included proposals to establish a Korean won pegged stablecoin market, and allow domestic companies to issue stablecoins. Sejin Kim believes the stablecoin debate has the wrong priorities. She said the FSC and BOK are too focused on licensing authority and the idea that stablecoins are the key to unlocking new growth industries. She stressed that stablecoins work as a high volume settlement system with razor thin profit margins. The success of Korea’s stablecoin ecosystem depends on how distribution costs are managed and whether surrounding industries grow around it. “Licensing follows after the design principles are formed,” she said. “For a won pegged stablecoin to function in Korea’s real economy, it must be designed alongside actual use cases such as spot ETFs, tokenized securities (STO), international remittances, and cross-border B2B settlement. ETFs act as the investment pipe. Stablecoins act as the settlement pipe. Korea can only capture global capital flows if both pipes move together.” Central bank caution The BOK insists that the issuance of won stablecoins should be bank-led. In its stablecoin whitepaper , the BOK outlined several risk factors, such as depegging where the coin loses its one-on-one value with fiat currency, mass redemptions, as well as foreign exchange violations and capital flight. BOK Governor Chang-yong Rhee said that the issuance of won pegged stablecoin could act as a bypass for foreign exchange regulations, potentially increasing capital outflow and exchange rate volatility. Jaewon Choi, professor of finance at Seoul National University, agrees with the BOK’s measured approach. While USD stablecoins are traded at high volumes in Korea, he is uncertain whether a won-denominated stablecoin will gain traction. “I think the Bank of Korea’s concerns are legitimate. Of course, we can’t predict whether a stablecoin will collapse until it happens. But given that the most liquid USD stablecoins have a risk of depegging, it is not surprising that the BOK suspects that won denominated stablecoins carry the same risk.” Sejin Kim, fintech policy analyst at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation stressed that the Korean won cannot be compared to the dominant USD stablecoins. “The won does not have the same global liquidity profile, so Korea needs to carefully evaluate the economic effects of introducing won pegged stablecoins at scale.” Jeonghwan JK Kim of Architect Legal Advisory said Korea’s regulatory philosophy remains rooted in a “positive-list” model, where only activities explicitly approved by authorities are allowed. “Initial coin offerings are a prime example of this because they are not formally banned, but they have never launched in practice because of regulatory pressure,” he said. It’s a legacy that makes it difficult for Korea to adopt a market-driven, innovation-first framework like the U.S. Genius Act. Two issuers, one coin Korean won pegged stablecoin issuers are waiting in the wings for legislation to be finalized. Blockchain developer IQ AI and Frax Finance announced the launch of the KRWX stablecoin on October 30. The coin was built for multi-blockchain and cross-border use. It is still at the proof-of-concept stage and not yet available to South Korean residents KRW1 , launched by Busan Digital Asset Custody Services in September, is officially South Korea’s first stablecoin. It was designed around Korea’s regulations and with institutional transactions in mind. In particular, cross-border remittances, emergency aid distribution, and institutional finance applications. The token remains in pilot mode until national stablecoins rules are finalized. Control versus innovation South Korea is leaning towards splitting duties, with the central bank managing reserves and settlement, and the FSC oversees licensing and exchanges, said Jeonghwan JK Kim. “It’s not yet a formal agreement, but the bills assume some form of shared responsibility.” He said it’s likely that the first stablecoins will come from bank-led consortia rather than tech startups. “Both regulators share a common recognition that stablecoins should be introduced gradually and should function as a safe, institutionally anchored asset.” This kind of a model would make Korea’s version of stablecoins less experimental but more durable.

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-death-cross-incoming-heres-the-significance/,"A new technical pattern on XRP’s daily chart has become a focal point in the crypto market after Coin Bureau shared an analysis highlighting an approaching Death Cross on the XRP chart. The chart shows the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) nearing a crossover below the 200-day SMA. Although there is notable recovery right now, t raders see this formation as a bearish indicator that could signal continued downward pressure in the near term. The chart illustrates XRP trading around the $2.17 level, while the shorter-term 50-day SMA (blue line) trends downward toward the longer-term 200-day SMA (red line). A yellow circle on the chart marks the imminent point of crossover. ALERT: XRP DEATH CROSS INCOMING! The 50 day SMA is about to cross the 200 day SMA. This is considered bearish and is termed a ""Death Cross"". pic.twitter.com/3Pa3VsWvNX — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) November 7, 2025 Understanding the Death Cross The Death Cross occurs when a shorter-term moving average, such as the 50-day SMA, crosses below a longer-term average, typically the 200-day SMA. This pattern suggests that short-term momentum has weakened relative to the long-term trend, often interpreted by traders as a sign that selling pressure could dominate. Historically, the Death Cross has preceded market downturns in various asset classes, though its predictive accuracy is often debated among analysts. In XRP’s case, the crossover comes after a series of lower highs and declining daily closes that began after resistance near the $2.7 region. The 50-day SMA, which tracks more recent price action, has been declining since mid-October, reflecting persistent weakness. Meanwhile, the 200-day SMA has maintained a slower downward slope, reflecting the broader trend that has been in place for several months. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Where is XRP Going Next? Coin Bureau has been tracking this death cross for some time, and the chart indicates that XRP has already fallen almost 30% from its October highs, with bears maintaining control of short-term market momentum. The current setup reinforces what many traders view as a continuation of the correction phase that began after a failed breakout attempt earlier in the quarter. While Coin Bureau did not provide a price target or extended commentary in the post, the chart’s structure implies caution for those anticipating an immediate reversal. The Death Cross alone does not guarantee further losses, but it serves as a warning signal. Other analysts have predicted a continued downturn for XRP , as the broader crypto market also faces bearish pressure. Until a reversal pattern forms, the digital asset will likely continue this decline, potentially testing crucial support around $2.

The Senate on Sunday advanced a 60-vote cloture deal to reopen the federal government, sending the package to the House and President Trump for approval. The agreement funds operations through Jan. 30, 2026, reverses certain employee firings, secures SNAP benefits through fiscal 2026 and sets up a December vote on Affordable Care Act subsidies. Relief over a near-term resolution fed risk appetite, and traders rotated into higher beta assets. Nasdaq futures rose 0.8% and S&P 500 futures gained 0.5% in early trade, signaling a firmer Wall Street open. Crypto reflected the swing in sentiment. After the early pop, Bitcoin last traded near $106,097, up 4.4% from 24 hours earlier. Market snapshot Bitcoin : $106,097, up 4.4% Ether : $3,636.14, up 7.9% XRP : $2.44, up 7.8% Total crypto market cap: $3.66 trillion, up 4.8% Investors Looked Past Recent Volatility As Liquidity Returned To Equities And Crypto Across equities, MSCI’s Asia ex-Japan index added 0.5% and Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.6%. South Korea’s Kospi advanced 2%, and in Europe, Euro Stoxx 50 and DAX futures gained 1.3% each. Bond markets signaled a modest unwind of safety trades. The US 10-year yield edged up to about 4.13%, while the two-year rose to roughly 3.59%. The dollar recovered part of last week’s pullback as investors reassessed the growth outlook against a patient Federal Reserve. Inside Washington, the prolonged shutdown has strained the economy. Federal workers across airports, law enforcement and the military have gone unpaid, and the central bank has faced data gaps with limited government reporting. NEW: U.S. GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN PREDICTED TO END NOV. 14 ON @Polymarket , AS AXIOS REPORTS AT LEAST 10 SENATE DEMOCRATS WILL BACK PROCEDURAL MOTION FOR SPENDING BILLS AND SHORT-TERM FUNDING THROUGH JANUARY SOURCE: https://t.co/niBILMkqxl pic.twitter.com/rNHNAenYqn — DEGEN NEWS (@DegenerateNews) November 9, 2025 Shutdown Fallout Weighs On Confidence, Keeping Investors Cautious White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said fourth-quarter GDP could turn negative if the shutdown persisted. Consumer nerves showed up in the data. US consumer sentiment fell to near a three-and-a-half-year low in early November as households weighed the potential fallout, adding another layer of uncertainty to trading desks. For crypto, the path to a deal matters. The shutdown had tightened liquidity across pockets of the market and increased volatility around macro releases, so clearer fiscal footing lowers tail risks and supports positioning in digital assets sensitive to growth and risk cycles. Wall Street Eyes Shutdown Vote After Turbulent Week For Tech Stocks Equity investors kept one eye on last week’s shakeout. Concerns over stretched valuations in AI-linked names sparked the Nasdaq Composite’s worst week since April’s tariff-driven selloff, with the index down 3%. The S&P 500 fell 1.6% and the Dow slipped 1.2% for the week. Fed speakers last week signaled a preference to go slow on further rate cuts, and recent employment readings hinted at softening momentum. Traders, balancing those signals with the shutdown news, leaned toward a constructive start to the week. As the House takes up the Senate package and the White House reviews it, markets will watch the timeline closely. A clean passage keeps the relief bid intact, while any snag could revive volatility across both stocks and crypto.

The price is trading above $3,500 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $3,350 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move up if it clears the $3,720 zone. Ethereum Price Attempts Recovery Ethereum price managed to stay above $3,200 and started a recovery wave, like Bitcoin . ETH price was able to climb above the $3,350 and $3,400 resistance levels. There was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $3,350 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair surpassed the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,920 swing high to the $3,058 low. The upward move was such that the price spiked above $3,620. Ethereum price is now trading above $3,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is another recovery wave, the price could face resistance near the $3,650 level.

The first major resistance is near the $3,750 level. A clear move above the $3,750 resistance might send the price toward the $3,820 resistance.

This shocking reality unfolded as crypto futures liquidated at an alarming rate, with short traders bearing the brutal brunt of the market movement. The perpetual futures market experienced one of its most dramatic sessions recently, leaving traders reeling from massive losses. What Exactly Happened With These Crypto Futures Liquidations? The cryptocurrency derivatives market witnessed a perfect storm that triggered widespread liquidations. When we say crypto futures liquidated, we’re referring to the forced closure of leveraged positions when traders can’t meet margin requirements. This recent episode saw an overwhelming majority of these forced closures hitting traders who had bet against the market. Let’s break down the staggering numbers: Bitcoin liquidations totaled $115 million Short positions accounted for 91.35% of BTC liquidations Ethereum saw $91.42 million in liquidations 86.27% of ETH liquidations were short positions Zcash experienced $14.47 million in liquidations Why Did Short Traders Get Hit So Hard? The massive wave of crypto futures liquidated primarily affected short sellers because of unexpected price movements. When markets move against short positions, these traders face immediate margin calls. Many were caught off guard by sudden price increases, forcing exchanges to automatically close their positions. This domino effect creates what traders call a ‘short squeeze.’ As prices rise, short positions get liquidated, which then fuels further buying pressure. Consequently, more crypto futures liquidated in a cascading effect that amplified the market movement. How Does This Impact the Broader Crypto Market? When significant amounts of crypto futures liquidated occur, the entire market feels the ripple effects. These massive liquidations can create increased volatility and affect market sentiment. However, they also help reset leveraged positions, potentially creating healthier market conditions afterward. Traders should note that periods of heavy liquidation often precede calmer market conditions. The removal of excessive leverage typically reduces future volatility. Therefore, understanding these cycles becomes crucial for anyone involved in crypto derivatives trading. What Can Traders Learn From This Liquidation Event? The recent $220 million liquidation event offers valuable lessons for crypto traders. First, proper risk management remains essential when trading leveraged products. Second, diversifying positions across different timeframes and assets can help mitigate liquidation risks. Key takeaways include: Always use stop-loss orders Maintain adequate margin buffers Monitor market conditions continuously Avoid over-leveraging during volatile periods Will We See More Crypto Futures Liquidated Soon? Market analysts suggest that while such massive liquidation events are dramatic, they’re not uncommon in crypto markets. The high volatility inherent in cryptocurrency trading means traders should always prepare for potential liquidation waves. However, the concentration of short positions in this particular event made it especially noteworthy. As the market continues to evolve, we may see different patterns emerge. What remains constant is the need for cautious trading practices and thorough market analysis. Frequently Asked Questions What causes crypto futures to get liquidated? Crypto futures get liquidated when traders cannot meet margin requirements, typically due to adverse price movements against their positions. How can I avoid getting liquidated? Use proper risk management, maintain sufficient margin, employ stop-loss orders, and avoid excessive leverage during volatile market conditions. Why were short positions hit harder in this event? Short positions suffered more because unexpected price increases triggered margin calls against traders betting on price declines. Do liquidation events affect spot prices? Yes, large liquidation events can create increased volatility and temporary price distortions in spot markets due to forced selling or buying. How often do major liquidation events occur? Significant liquidation events happen periodically, often coinciding with major market movements or unexpected news events. Can liquidation events create trading opportunities? Experienced traders sometimes use liquidation events to enter positions at potentially favorable prices once the volatility subsides. Found this analysis helpful?

Ethereum continues to drive the decentralized economy through its Layer-2 expansion, improving speed and scalability across millions of daily transactions. Hedera, on the other hand, is buzzing thanks to its enterprise-grade partnerships that push boundaries in data transparency and real-world integration. These giants are shaping how digital ecosystems evolve, setting the stage for new challengers ready to take a leap. Among these rising stars, MoonBull is making headlines with its MoonBull presale, now in Stage 6. The hype is real because it’s designed to deliver what every investor secretly craves – that rare 1000x crypto moment. With structured tokenomics and powerful community backing, MoonBull offers a presale opportunity that feels like catching lightning in a bottle – or rather, a bull in full charge. MoonBull ($MOBU): The 1000x Crypto Presale Changing the Game MoonBull’s presale feels like the crypto version of finding gold before the rush begins. It’s currently in Stage 6 at just $0.00008388, and the buzz is deafening. More than 1,900 holders have already jumped in, pushing the presale tally above $550K. Early backers are staring at a potential ROI of over 7244% from Stage 6 to the listing price of $0.00616 – the kind of return that turns peanuts into a feast. Here’s where it gets juicy: imagine investing $30,000 at this stage. When the listing hits, that could swell to over $2.17 million, setting up the kind of financial freedom meme coin dreams are made of. This isn’t empty hype – it’s structured through 23 smartly designed stages that steadily raise the price, ensuring scarcity and momentum at every turn. That’s why MoonBull is being touted as the 1000x crypto play of the year. Launch Plan: Built to Reward the Community MoonBull’s launch blueprint is another reason this project feels like the next 1000x crypto. After the final presale stage, liquidity is locked for 48 hours to stabilize price action, ensuring no dump drama. During the first hour of launch, selling requires a matching buy, meaning early holders won’t watch their gains vanish in thin air. The whole setup screams fairness and foresight. By deploying on Ethereum, MoonBull merges meme culture with DeFi stability. Its auto-liquidity injections, reflections, and burns work like a self-feeding bull engine – every transaction strengthens the system. From staking to governance, MoonBull transforms investors from mere spectators into participants shaping the project’s destiny. Ethereum: The Pioneer Still Leading the Charge Ethereum keeps proving why it’s the backbone of decentralized finance. With the 2025 rollout of enhanced Layer-2 scaling and Ethereum 2.0 validators topping 900,000, its transaction efficiency has gone from sluggish to slick. Developers and investors continue to favor it for its massive ecosystem of smart contracts, DEXs, and NFTs. It’s like the seasoned bull that’s still strong in the ring – tested, respected, and constantly improving. The platform’s focus on scalability and security has strengthened its position as the go-to network for innovation. Major projects rely on Ethereum’s backbone to launch dApps, DAOs, and token ecosystems. While newer blockchains are trying to bite into its market share, Ethereum remains untouchable due to its maturity, developer loyalty, and proven reliability. For investors chasing the next 1000x crypto, Ethereum’s evolution sets the tone for where innovation begins – and where MoonBull builds its foundation. Hedera: The Corporate-Grade Blockchain With a Twist Hedera’s 2025 momentum is driven by its unique Hashgraph consensus, which allows transactions at lightning speed with near-zero energy waste. It has partnered with global players like Google and IBM, showing the world that enterprise blockchain isn’t just a buzzword. With over 11 billion transactions processed and consistent network uptime, Hedera stands as the penguin in a crowd of bulls – calm, efficient, and quietly dominating its niche. What sets Hedera apart is its corporate council governance. Over 39 international organizations now help steer the platform, ensuring accountability and stability – something meme coin ecosystems can learn from. Yet even with its real-world adoption, Hedera’s growth still leaves room for agile projects like MoonBull to thrive. For those seeking the next 1000x crypto, Hedera’s stability contrasts perfectly with MoonBull’s daring, high-reward energy. Conclusion Based on the latest research and market trends, Ethereum continues to fortify its DeFi kingdom while Hedera advances enterprise-grade adoption with unmatched efficiency. Both ecosystems set the stage for innovation but lean toward long-term utility over viral growth. This leaves a wide gap in the market for bold meme tokens built on structure and substance – and that’s exactly where MoonBull, the potential 1000x crypto , charges in. MoonBull isn’t just another meme coin – it’s a movement. With its transparent MoonBull presale, 23 scarcity-driven stages, and tokenomics crafted for real reward, it’s pulling crypto enthusiasts back into the excitement of early adoption. The window fo r Stage 6 entry is closing fast, and every smart investor knows bulls don’t wait around.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/market-strategist-do-not-buy-xrp-anymore-heres-why/,"Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto), a popular market analyst, has issued a firm warning to investors, saying that XRP could be entering another significant downturn if a key technical condition persists. His analysis centers on the 200-week simple moving average (SMA), a metric that has historically signaled major market shifts for the asset. Technical Indicator Raises Concern In a recent video, Steph explained that XRP’s position relative to the 200-week SMA is crucial. “Do not buy XRP if we see multiple weekly closes below the 200 weekly simple moving average here in the blue color,” he said, referring to the technical line that tracks long-term price trends. He pointed to two previous examples where similar signals preceded severe market declines . In 2018, when XRP closed two consecutive weekly candles below the 200-week SMA, it entered a sharp bear market that pushed its price down by approximately 81.13%. The same pattern repeated in 2021, leading to another 66.06% drop. Steph Is Crypto noted that XRP has once again fallen below this level, suggesting that history could repeat itself if the token remains there for an extended period. Do Not Buy #XRP Anymore… pic.twitter.com/6ADLtEbk62 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) November 7, 2025 Potential Downside Projections With XRP currently trading around $2.3, applying those historical declines gives a sobering perspective. An 81.13% decline from current levels would bring the asset down to $0.43, while a 66.06% drop would put it near $0.78. These figures are hypothetical but grounded in past reactions to similar technical breakdowns. The analyst emphasized that traders should “watch this very closely,” as sustained weakness below the 200-week SMA may confirm a bearish phase similar to prior cycles. For investors relying heavily on technical indicators, such a move could be interpreted as a sign to stay out of the market until a clear recovery is visible above that key threshold. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Short-Term Strength Could Offer Relief Despite these warnings, XRP’s recent performance shows some encouraging signs. The asset has climbed by almost 4% in the past 24 hours, indicating that buyers are still active and willing to support the price at current levels. This short-term momentum could provide temporary relief if sustained buying pressure lifts XRP further. Technical trends can change quickly, and a continued climb could invalidate the bearish outlook and shift sentiment once again. Until then, Steph’s advice is that traders monitor weekly closes to see if XRP follows its historical pattern or breaks from it before making new investment decisions.

A massive 235,661,219 USDT – valued at approximately $236 million – has just moved from an unknown wallet to the OKX exchange. This enormous transaction represents one of the most significant capital movements in recent crypto history, and market watchers are scrambling to understand its implications. What Does This Massive USDT Whale Transfer Mean? When we see a USDT whale transfer of this magnitude, it typically signals major market activity ahead. Large transfers to exchanges often precede significant trading moves. However, the unknown origin of this wallet adds an intriguing layer of mystery. Could this be an institution preparing for a major purchase? Or perhaps a whale positioning for market volatility? The timing of this USDT whale transfer is particularly interesting given current market conditions. With cryptocurrency prices showing increased volatility, such massive movements can significantly impact liquidity and trading patterns across multiple exchanges. Why Should Crypto Investors Care About Whale Movements? Understanding whale behavior is crucial for any serious cryptocurrency investor. These massive players can: Influence market prices through large buy or sell orders Signal upcoming trends before they become apparent to retail traders Affect liquidity across multiple trading pairs Provide insights into institutional sentiment This particular USDT whale transfer stands out not just for its size, but for its destination. OKX has become one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, making this movement even more significant for global market dynamics. How Do Unknown Wallets Impact Market Analysis?

Whale Alert is highly reliable for monitoring large blockchain transactions.

(Nov. 10),https://invezz.com/news/2025/11/10/why-is-the-crypto-market-going-up-today-nov-10/,"The crypto market rally gained steam on Monday morning, with the total valuation of all tokens jumping by nearly 5% to $4.57 trillion. Bitcoin remained above $105,000, while top coins like PUMP, Virtuals Protocol, Zcash, and Aerodrome Finance were up by over 15%. Crypto market rally happening as government shutdown nears end The main reason why the government shutdown is happening is that the longest government shutdown is nearing its end after some moderate senators reached a deal on Sunday. The proposed deal seems like a victory to Donald Trump and the Republicans, who have largely achieved most things they wanted, such as ending Obamacare subsidies. Democrats main victory was a commitment for no federal employees layoffs through January next year. Ending the government shutdown is a good thing for the crypto market as it removes one of the biggest risks in the market. It also means that the US will start releasing key macro data on areas like the labor market and inflation soon. These numbers are important as they help to complement those published by the private sector, which the Federal Reserve and other economists have been relying on in the past few months. Crypto market going up as SOFR rate slips Another key reason why the crypto market rally is happening is that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) has continued moving downwards, and is now at the lowest level in years. The SOFR is an important interest rate that companies like banks pay for overnight financing. It is collateralized by the US treasury in the repurchase or repo market. Analysts believe that the SOFR rate is often more important than the headline interest rate that the Fed cuts or raises. A falling SOFR rate boosts the stock and crypto markets by lowering the cost of borrowing, which leads to a risk-on sentiment among investors. SOFR rate has fallen recently | Source: Fred Demand for privacy tokens rising The other main catalyst for the ongoing crypto market rally is happening is that demand for privacy tokens is soaring . Data compiled by CoinMarketCap shows that privacy tokens are leading the ongoing surge in the crypto market industry. Zcash price has jumped from below $50 in October to $650 today, making it the 12th biggest token in the crypto industry. Dash price jumped by 14% in the last 24 hours, while other tokens like Monero, Horizen, and Decred have maintained their bull run. Rising volume and open interest The crypto market rally is also happening as volume and futures open interest gains steam. Data shows that open interest in the crypto industry jumped by 5.22% in the last 24 hours to $148 billion, a sign that investors are starting to deploy leverage into the industry. There are signs that the funding rate has bottomed after plunging sharply last month when over 1.6 million traders were liquidated. The volume in the spot market has also jumped in to past few days, moving to $270 billion in the last 24 hours. Upcoming crypto earnings The crypto market rally is happening ahead of the upcoming earnings by some of the biggest companies in the crypto industry. Gemini Space Station, the crypto exchange backed by the Winklevoss Twins, will be the first crypto exchange to publish it numbers this week. The other top companies to watch will be TeraWulf and Circle. TeraWulf is a $5 billion company that mines Bitcoin and is now pivoting to the AI data center space. Circle, on the other hand, is the company behind USDC, the second-biggest company in the stablecoin industry after Tether. The post Why is the crypto market going up today?

This decisive action brings relief to millions of Americans and federal workers who faced uncertainty about government operations and services. What Does the Temporary Budget Bill Accomplish? The newly passed temporary budget bill provides essential government funding through January, ensuring continuous operation of federal agencies and services. This stopgap measure passed with a solid 60-40 vote margin, demonstrating bipartisan support for keeping the government functioning. Following the bill’s approval, President Donald Trump expressed optimism about the shutdown ending soon. The temporary budget bill represents a practical solution that allows more time for comprehensive budget negotiations while preventing immediate disruption to government services. Why Was This Temporary Budget Bill Necessary? Government shutdowns create widespread consequences that affect: Federal employee pay and benefits Essential public services National park operations Economic stability and market confidence The temporary budget bill serves as a bridge solution, providing lawmakers additional time to reach consensus on longer-term funding arrangements. This approach prevents the damaging effects of a full government shutdown while maintaining critical operations. How Does the Political Process Unfold From Here? With the temporary budget bill now passed, attention shifts to the House of Representatives and presidential approval. The legislative process requires both chambers to agree on identical versions before the bill reaches the President’s desk for signature. This temporary budget bill success follows reports of senators reaching partial agreements earlier in the week. The 60-40 vote margin indicates significant cross-party cooperation, suggesting growing consensus around the urgency of avoiding a government shutdown. What Are the Immediate Impacts of This Decision? The passage of this temporary budget bill brings several immediate benefits: Federal workers can continue their duties without interruption Government services remain accessible to citizens Economic uncertainty decreases International confidence in US stability strengthens Moreover, the temporary budget bill creates a stable environment for businesses and individuals who rely on consistent government operations. This stability is crucial for maintaining economic momentum and public confidence. Looking Ahead: What Comes After This Temporary Budget Bill? While this temporary budget bill resolves the immediate crisis, it sets the stage for more comprehensive budget negotiations in the coming months. Lawmakers now have until January to develop a longer-term funding solution that addresses broader fiscal priorities. The successful passage of this temporary budget bill demonstrates that bipartisan cooperation remains possible in challenging political environments. It serves as a model for future negotiations and highlights the importance of pragmatic solutions over ideological standoffs. Frequently Asked Questions What is a temporary budget bill? A temporary budget bill, often called a continuing resolution, provides short-term funding to keep government operations running when full-year budgets aren’t approved by the deadline. How long does this temporary budget bill last? This specific temporary budget bill funds the government through January, giving lawmakers several months to negotiate a more comprehensive budget agreement. What happens if a temporary budget bill isn’t passed? Without a temporary budget bill or full budget approval, the government would partially shut down, furloughing non-essential workers and suspending many services.

The company operates the Truth Social social media platform and saw revenues decline to $972,900 from over $1 million a year ago. Shares ended trading down 1.73% at $13.10 and rose slightly after hours to $13.20. Crypto Holdings and Strategy Trump Media held 11,542 Bitcoin as of September 30. The company first began buying Bitcoin in late July and has indicated plans to acquire more, alongside exploring other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin holdings generated $15.3 million of realised income from options investments. Additionally, the company posted $33 million in unrealised gains from holding Cronos tokens. The company said it acquired Bitcoin as part of an investment strategy launched in May after raising $1.5 billion from stock sales and $1 billion from bonds. Expansion and Treasury Moves CEO Devin Nunes stated the quarter was crucial to Trump Media’s expansion plans. He said the company has “secured our financial future with a massive Bitcoin treasury, and expanded our existing platforms.” The company also formed Trump Media Group CRO Strategy, a digital asset treasury company aimed at buying up to $1 billion in Cronos tokens, representing over 6.3 trillion units. “With these financial assets now earning income, alongside our second consecutive quarter of positive operating cash flow, we’re well-poised to act on our mergers and acquisitions strategy,” Nunes said. Financial Assets and Stock Challenges Trump Media’s financial assets grew from $274 million in March 2024 to $3.1 billion as of September 30. Despite this, the company’s stock has struggled, losing 61% year-to-date.

In a recent interview with the South China Morning Post , Winters praised the city’s forward-thinking regulatory approach, saying its openness to experimentation has created an ideal environment for developing blockchain solutions that can transform financial services. He pointed to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s (HKMA) pilot programmes on tokenized deposits, wholesale central bank digital currencies and stablecoins as examples of how regulators are enabling innovation without compromising safety. “We’re going to remain ahead on digital technology, and what we lose in margin, we’re going to make up in volume by providing a better service to our customers,” Winters said. Hong Kong Deepens Fintech Ambitions With Fintech 2030 Hong Kong’s push to become a global hub for digital finance gained fresh momentum last week. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority launched its five-year “Fintech 2030” strategy to accelerate innovation across the city’s financial system. The plan focuses on four pillars (data and payments, artificial intelligence, resilience and tokenization) together forming the DART framework. This roadmap will guide the next wave of Hong Kong’s fintech growth. In addition, the initiative includes more than 40 programmes aimed at integrating new technologies, strengthening cybersecurity and expanding financial inclusion. Collectively, these efforts could help the sector surpass $600b in revenue by 2032. Hong Kong will allow licensed crypto exchanges to connect with global order books, ending its current isolated trading model. #HongKong #Crypto https://t.co/f8Lj9NKxoR — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 3, 2025 Regulators are also easing constraints on digital asset trading. Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) Chief Executive Julia Leung said licensed crypto exchanges in Hong Kong will soon be allowed to link with global order books , enabling local platforms to tap into broader liquidity and attract more institutional players. Standard Chartered Builds Momentum In Capital-Light, High-Return Digital Segments Standard Chartered has played an active role in the HKMA’s regulatory sandboxes, where new blockchain applications are tested in controlled settings. Winters said blockchain technology could lower transaction costs and improve efficiency across financial services. “Ultimately, people will prioritise moving money securely, efficiently and cheaply,” he said. “Financial markets always find a way.” He added that the bank would continue to strengthen compliance with anti-money-laundering and fraud-prevention rules as it scales digital operations. Growth In High-Return Segments Lifts Standard Chartered’s Quarterly Earnings Standard Chartered’s commitment to digital finance is already paying off. In the third quarter, the bank’s net profit rose 10% to $1.03b, beating analyst expectations. The performance was driven by growth in capital-light, high-return segments such as wealth management, cross-border payments and digital finance. “Those areas are less capital-intensive, higher-returning and fast-growing, so we’re happy to keep deploying resources there,” Winters said. Hong Kong remains a key investment destination for Standard Chartered’s affluent and wealth management business across Asia, the Middle East and Africa. The bank plans to invest $1.5b in wealth management over the next five years. This move reinforces its long-term commitment to the region. For Bill Winters, Hong Kong’s growing regulatory clarity and strong institutional participation strengthen its appeal. Moreover, the city’s openness to blockchain innovation makes it central to Standard Chartered’s digital finance roadmap.

The clip features Trump speaking about how the country’s payment and money transfer systems remain “ decades out of date ,” and how new legislation would make the entire framework “eligible for a 21st century upgrade using the state-of-the-art crypto technology.” Trump’s comments struck a familiar chord within the XRP community. The statement about crypto-driven modernization came at a time when many digital asset advocates have emphasized the need for scalable blockchain systems capable of supporting global financial settlements. XRP supporters in particular view these remarks as aligning closely with the use cases long associated with Ripple’s XRP-powered payment solutions and technology. He basically said XRP without saying XRP pic.twitter.com/CytuHZdcCu — XRPee (@XRPee3) November 8, 2025 Interpretation of Trump’s Message In his response to Trump’s comments, XRPee told his audience that the president had effectively confirmed what many in the crypto space have been saying for years. “You can no longer deny the fact that the reset is happening in real time,” he said, adding that most Americans “have no clue” about the scale of the change taking place behind the scenes. He argued that Trump’s statement showed that cryptocurrencies will be the backbone of this transition , and he suggests that XRP and similar technologies could play a role in this shift, given their design for real-time, low-cost transactions. While Trump did not name any specific cryptocurrency, XRPee emphasized that his comments align with the direction Ripple and its ecosystem have pursued for over a decade. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 How XRP Fits into the Conversation The XRP Ledger has been positioned as a solution to inefficiencies Trump described. It enables near-instant cross-border settlements without relying on outdated intermediary networks. The idea that “payments and money transfers are costly and take days or even weeks to clear,” as Trump stated, mirrors the problem Ripple has long sought to solve through its use of blockchain technology. For years, Ripple executives and developers have described their system as an upgrade to the traditional infrastructure underpinning the global financial system. Although Trump’s statement was delivered in the context of a legislative proposal, it has resonated strongly among crypto enthusiasts who believe the financial reset is underway. While Trump never mentioned XRP directly, his acknowledgment of crypto technology as key to modernizing America’s financial system has been interpreted by many as a signal that the era of XRP integration and adoption may be closer than expected.

The campaign, running from 16:00 on November 7 to 15:59 on November 14 (UTC), is designed to help users manage funds more efficiently and seize opportunities in volatile markets. The campaign is simple to participate in, with exceptional discounts and no entry requirements. Users who complete KYC verification and take margin loans or collateral swaps will enjoy real, tangible savings. Let us dive into the campaign for details. https://www.htx.com/support/35016819991657 Event 1: Enjoy Up to 30% Interest Rebate on USDT Loans To meet strong demand for stablecoin borrowing during market swings, HTX is launching tiered rebates for USDT loans. During the event, users who borrow USDT via HTX Margin or Collateral Swap (formerly Crypto Loans) will receive a rebate of up to 30% of the actual interest paid, based on cumulative borrowing volume. The specific rules are as follows: Borrow ≥10,000 USDT to receive a 10% rebate; Borrow ≥100,000 USDT to receive a 20% rebate; Borrow ≥1,000,000 USDT to win a 30% rebate. The more you borrow, the more you can save. With interest discounts of up to 30%, every loan becomes a low-cost opportunity to capture profits amid market volatility. Event 2: Up to 50% Off Borrowing Costs on PoW Token Loans – Exclusive for Prime Users HTX is also rolling out loan interest rate discounts for BTC and other major PoW assets. During the event, users borrowing BTC, LTC, DOGE, BCH, or ETC via HTX Margin or Collateral Swap will receive tiered interest reductions according to their Prime level: Average users: 10% off; Prime 1-3: 30% off; Prime 4 and above: 50% off. The discount applies automatically with no extra steps required. Higher Prime levels unlock deeper savings, giving traders a notable cost advantage in hedging, arbitrage, or margin trading. Event 3: Borrow & Earn – Interest Vouchers for Every Participant All participants who borrow a cumulative total of 20,000 USDT (or equivalent) across any supported cryptocurrency via HTX Margin or Collateral Swap will receive a 10% Interest Voucher, capped at 300 USDT. The voucher is valid for 14 days and can be applied to future margin loans or swaps. It also works in combination with Prime discounts for even greater savings. In fast-moving crypto markets, time defines opportunity, and cost defines advantage.

In London, the BBC reels from a leadership shake-up after a Trump documentary scandal. Meanwhile, Beijing and Washington ease trade tensions with reciprocal port fee suspensions, and Bitcoin rockets past $106,000, signaling renewed confidence in crypto markets. A glance at the major developments this morning. Senate Democrats strike deal to end shutdown After 40 tense days of the longest government shutdown in US history, Senate Democrats finally struck a breakthrough deal on Sunday. In a 60–40 vote, the Senate agreed to move forward with a bipartisan plan to get most of the government back up and running through January 30, 2026. Eight Democrats crossed party lines to back the measure, bowing to growing frustration from the public over unpaid federal workers and airport chaos caused by the shutdown. The deal includes guaranteed back pay for federal employees and restores full SNAP benefits, but Democrats had to compromise on one key issue: immediate extensions to Affordable Care Act subsidies. Instead, they secured a promise for a future Senate vote on those health care provisions. The agreement now heads to the House, which still needs to approve it before the government officially reopens. BBC chief quits over Trump documentary scandal The BBC was thrown into chaos this weekend after both Director General Tim Davie and News CEO Deborah Turness resigned over a major controversy surrounding a Panorama documentary about former President Donald Trump. The program came under fire for allegedly editing together parts of Trump’s January 6 speech in a way that made it look like he directly urged his supporters to “fight like hell” and storm the Capitol, something critics say was misleading and unfair. The backlash was swift, sparking accusations of bias and deepening concerns about the BBC’s editorial standards. Davie said he took “ultimate responsibility” for what happened and that stepping down was his own decision. Turness, meanwhile, admitted the situation had become too damaging for the organization, saying accountability had to come first. Trump wasted no time responding, blasting the BBC as “corrupt journalists.” China, US pause port fees amid thaw China announced it’s suspending port fees on US-linked vessels for a full year starting November 10, 2025, a move that marks a rare moment of calm in the ongoing trade tensions between the two countries. According to the Chinese transport ministry, the decision comes as part of a reciprocal deal after the US agreed to pause its own retaliatory port fees on Chinese ships. It’s a small but meaningful step toward cooling things down in the maritime trade arena, where costs and delays have been piling up for months. The suspension is expected to give global shipping networks some breathing room by easing financial and logistical pressures. For shipping companies, it’s a welcome bit of relief. And for both Washington and Beijing, it’s a sign they’re at least trying to steer relations, and their shipbuilding industries, back into smoother waters. Bitcoin blazes past $106K as crypto markets rally Bitcoin has smashed through the $106,000 mark, setting a new record in what’s shaping up to be one of its most powerful rallies yet. The surge comes as big financial institutions and corporations continue jumping on board, with some even parking portions of their treasuries in Bitcoin, a sign that mainstream adoption is accelerating fast. Behind the rally, improvements to the Bitcoin network itself have made transactions more efficient and secure, adding to investor confidence. This latest high blows past previous records, climbing roughly 60% above the 2021 peak of around $65,000. Yes, Bitcoin is still volatile as it always has been, but the market’s tone feels different this time. Stronger network activity, clearer regulations, and a more mature ecosystem are giving investors reason to believe this isn’t just another short-term spike, but part of a longer, steadier climb.

Bloomberg reported Monday that the new set of “digitally native” bonds will be denominated in US dollars, Hong Kong dollars, euros and offshore yuan. Sources familiar with the move said that the deal could be priced as early as Monday. A digital bond is a type of security issued and managed using blockchain technology. The blockchain allows the bond’s details and ownership to be recorded securely and transparently on a digital ledger. The latest offering of digitally native bonds across multiple currencies can be issued on public blockchains like Ethereum or via DLT platforms offered by HSBC Holdings or Goldman Sachs. Hong Kong is marketing a new set of “digitally native” bonds denominated in multiple currencies, intensifying the city’s drive to become a global hub for digital assets https://t.co/uZjZ8bDhUh — Bloomberg (@business) November 10, 2025 Digital Bonds Gain Traction in Hong Kong Hong Kong’s latest move builds on the city’s established tokenized bond frameworks announced in 2024. The HKMA introduced its second tokenized green bond in 2023 , aiming to leverage blockchain for transparency in the redemption process. Besides, Hong Kong has solidified its position as Asia’s leading international bond issuance hub . It accounts for nearly 30% of Asian international bond issuances, topping the regional league table for nine years. The announcement to sell digital green bonds comes days after global asset manager Franklin Templeton launched Hong Kong’s first tokenized money-market fund. The fund uses blockchain to boost transparency and transaction efficiency and is initially open to institutional investors. Further, Hong Kong-based corporates issue at least six digital notes, Bloomberg noted. These notes have raised a total of $1 billion with four launching this year. Rain Yin, Director at S&P Global Ratings, said that the firm has given AA+ rating to the proposed digital notes. “Those are mitigated by a plan that requires, ultimately, shifting the notes to the traditional systems in case of disruption.” The post Hong Kong Launches ‘Digitally Native’ Bonds to Intensify Crypto Hub Ambitions appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|Digital Assets|Hong Kong,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-11-10 05:22:38

His bullish outlook was shared amid rising market uncertainty and recent analysis showing Bitcoin’s fundamentals hinting at a rebound. However, contrasting views from market analysts paint a more cautious picture, with whales and long-term holders offloading assets and driving persistent sell pressure, very similar to the post-dot-com crash era. Analysts suggest this consolidation phase could last up to another year. Kiyosaki Bets on Hard Assets Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki reinforced his bullish stance on hard assets by saying he’s buying more gold, silver, Bitcoin, and Ethereum as global markets brace for what he believes will be an inevitable financial crash. In a post that was shared on X on Sunday, Kiyosaki warned of an impending downturn but said he is preparing for it by accumulating assets he describes as “real money.” He also set ambitious price targets of $27,000 for gold, $100 for silver, and $250,000 for Bitcoin by 2026. Kiyosaki attributed his gold forecast to economist Jim Rickards, while his Bitcoin projection aligns with his long-standing belief that BTC serves as a hedge against what he calls the Federal Reserve’s “fake money.” The bestselling author also revealed that he is turning increasingly optimistic about Ethereum, thanks to Fundstrat’s Tom Lee, who views the blockchain as the foundation for stablecoins and a crucial infrastructure for global finance. Kiyosaki said his investment philosophy is rooted in Gresham’s Law — the idea that bad money drives out good — and Metcalfe’s Law, which links a network’s value to its number of users. In addition to this, the outspoken financial educator once again criticized the US Treasury and the Federal Reserve for excessive money printing, and accused them of turning the United States into the “biggest debtor nation in history.” After once again sharing his well-known mantra that “savers are losers,” Kiyosaki urged investors to buy tangible assets even during market corrections, and argued that the coming crisis will widen the gap between real and “fake” money. On-chain indicators may actually support Kiyosaki’s optimism. Data from analytics firm Crypto Crib shows that Bitcoin’s Market Value to Realised Value (MVRV) ratio returned to 1.8, which is a level that historically preceded big rebounds of 30% to 50%. Meanwhile, former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes predicted that the Federal Reserve will soon resort to “stealth quantitative easing” to manage the ballooning US debt. Hayes said this form of hidden liquidity injection through the Fed’s Standing Repo Facility will quietly boost asset prices, particularly Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Crypto Faces Heavy Whale Selling On the other hand, crypto whales and long-term holders are cashing out and putting consistent selling pressure on the market, keeping prices subdued. This is according to analyst Jordi Visser . He compared the current state of the crypto market to the aftermath of the 2000s dot-com bubble, where tech stocks plunged by up to 80% and then spent more than a decade consolidating before recovering their highs. Visser explained that during that period, venture capitalists and insiders who invested in early-stage tech companies were locked into their positions due to investment restrictions, and once those lock-up periods expired, they began offloading their holdings into every market rally in search of liquidity. Visser said a similar dynamic is now playing out in crypto, as early investors and insiders in projects like Solana, Ethereum, and Bitcoin sell their holdings during every price rebound, weighing down the broader market. He clarified that it will not take 16 years for the crypto sector to recover as it did for tech stocks, but used the comparison to explain that the market is in a prolonged consolidation phase that could last up to another year before a decisive rebound occurs. The comments were made as sentiment across the digital asset market turned increasingly cautious. Many analysts and investment firms have scaled back their bullish forecasts, with some suggesting that a bear market may have started in October. Bitcoin, which recently dipped below $106,000, showed some early signs of stabilizing around the $100,000 level, though some analysts warn that continued selling pressure could push the price as low as $92,000. BTC’s price action over the past month (Source: CoinMarketCap ) According to CryptoQuant analyst Julio Moreno , the selling activity by whales and long-term holders is not inherently negative—it only becomes a drag on prices when demand fails to absorb the new supply entering the market. Moreno pointed out that since October, long-term holder selling increased as demand simultaneously weakened, leaving the market unable to sustain higher prices. This combination of diminished demand and persistent whale selling created a grinding market environment that is very similar to the consolidation seen in past post-bubble periods. This suggests that crypto may still have some way to go before a clear recovery begins.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-10 05:30:00

South Korea’s leading exchange Upbit has announced a temporary suspension of Moss Coin (MOC) deposits and withdrawals starting November 12 at 9:00 AM UTC. This crucial Upbit MOC suspension comes as the platform prepares for a significant network switch that could impact your trading activities. Why Is Upbit Implementing This MOC Suspension? The primary reason behind this temporary halt is a network migration for Moss Coin. When blockchain networks undergo upgrades or switches, exchanges must pause transactions to ensure security and prevent potential losses. This Upbit MOC suspension demonstrates the exchange’s commitment to protecting user assets during technical transitions. Network switches involve complex technical processes that require: Complete synchronization with the new blockchain Security verification of all transaction pathways Testing of deposit and withdrawal mechanisms Validation of smart contract functionality What Does This Mean for MOC Holders? If you currently hold Moss Coin on Upbit, here’s what you need to know about this Upbit MOC suspension . During the maintenance period, you cannot deposit new MOC tokens to your Upbit wallet or withdraw existing holdings. However, your assets remain secure in your account, and trading of MOC against other cryptocurrencies may continue unaffected. This temporary measure actually benefits users in several ways: Prevents transaction errors during network transition Ensures smooth migration to upgraded blockchain Maintains the integrity of your digital assets Provides time for comprehensive security checks When Will Normal Services Resume? Upbit has indicated that the Upbit MOC suspension will begin precisely at 9:00 AM UTC on November 12. The exchange typically provides updates through official channels once the network switch completes successfully. Users should monitor Upbit’s announcement page for the resumption notice, as the duration depends on the complexity of the migration process. Historical data shows that similar network upgrades usually take between 2-8 hours, but preparation is key. Therefore, plan your MOC transactions accordingly and avoid last-minute transfers around the suspension timeframe. How Can You Prepare for the Suspension? Smart cryptocurrency management means anticipating such events. Before the Upbit MOC suspension takes effect, consider these proactive steps: Complete any urgent MOC deposits or withdrawals beforehand Monitor Upbit’s official communication channels regularly Keep your account security measures updated Diversify your trading strategies to account for temporary limitations Remember that such suspensions are standard industry practice during network upgrades. Major exchanges like Upbit implement these measures to protect user funds and ensure seamless transition to improved blockchain networks. What Are the Long-Term Benefits? While temporary inconveniences exist, this Upbit MOC suspension ultimately serves the Moss Coin ecosystem’s growth. Network upgrades typically bring enhanced features such as faster transaction speeds, lower fees, improved security, and better scalability. These improvements can potentially increase MOC’s utility and market value over time. The cryptocurrency space evolves rapidly, and periodic network maintenance ensures your investments remain compatible with the latest technological advancements. Upbit’s proactive approach demonstrates their commitment to providing a secure and updated trading environment. Final Thoughts: Navigating Temporary Disruptions The upcoming Upbit MOC suspension represents a necessary step toward technological progress in the blockchain space. While temporary transaction halts might cause minor disruptions, they ultimately contribute to a more robust and efficient cryptocurrency infrastructure. Stay informed, plan ahead, and recognize that these measures protect your digital assets in the long run. The cryptocurrency landscape requires adaptability from both exchanges and users. Upbit’s transparent communication about the Moss Coin network switch sets a positive industry standard for handling such technical transitions responsibly. Frequently Asked Questions Can I trade MOC during the suspension? Typically, trading continues normally during deposit and withdrawal suspensions. However, check Upbit’s specific announcement for confirmation. How long will the Upbit MOC suspension last? Upbit hasn’t specified an end time, but similar network upgrades usually take 2-8 hours. Monitor official channels for updates. Are my MOC coins safe during this period? Yes, your existing MOC holdings remain secure in your Upbit wallet throughout the suspension. Will this affect MOC’s market price? Temporary suspensions rarely cause significant price impacts unless combined with other market factors. Should I move my MOC to another exchange before the suspension? Only if you need immediate access during the suspension period. Otherwise, waiting is generally safer to avoid transfer risks. How will I know when services resume? Upbit will publish an official announcement on their website and social media channels once normal operations restore.

The proposal passed a key procedural vote 60–40 and is expected to proceed to a final vote later this week before heading to the House for approval. They still need to vote to make it official, but the results will likely be positive, as both parties support the plan. The U.S. Senate plans to end the shutdown It’s now 40 days since the government shutdown, and citizens across the country are feeling the effects firsthand as public offices remain closed, federal workers haven’t been paid, and government services continue to be delayed. The shutdown has primarily affected financial markets, including cryptocurrency, as investors tend to dislike uncertainty. Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune has made numerous attempts to meet with lawmakers from both parties, marking his 15th effort to resolve the issue. However, there is a glimmer of hope because senators are working on a three-part budget plan that will keep the government open until the end of January. Lawmakers will vote in December to extend tax credits from the Affordable Care Act for one more year and prevent or reverse layoffs of federal workers that happened during the shutdown. Senators received the final version of the budget bills before the weekend vote, allowing them more time to review the plan’s mission. And because the current situation is urgent, they have to return to Washington for a rare weekend session to vote on the plan. If all goes well, the Senate will proceed with the budget plan, and the government will finally open its doors after more than a month of shutdown. The crypto market reacts as the uncertainty goes down, and policies become clearer The price of Bitcoin increased rapidly and reached around $126,080 when the shutdown began, as investors saw an opportunity to buy while traditional markets remained uncertain about the future. However, as the shutdown lasted longer than expected, Bitcoin’s value fell by over 17% to approximately $104,370. This drop in Bitcoin occurred around the same time that President Donald Trump announced 100% tariffs on China, which unsettled global markets. Analysts say investors hesitated to buy, and institutions that planned to enter the crypto market stayed away because they were unsure how long the shutdown would last. Traders and analysts are closely monitoring the current situation, as past government shutdowns have had a similar impact on the cryptocurrency market. During the shutdown between December 2018 and January 2019, the price of Bitcoin increased from roughly $3,550 to $13,000 over the next five months after the government reopened. Prediction markets also expect the shutdown to end soon, as the probability that it will reopen between Tuesday and Friday increased from 27% to 54% on Polymarket. President Trump also announced that most Americans may receive a $2,000 dividend from tariff revenue to increase consumer spending and inject more money into the economy. Analysts will closely monitor the timing of the Senate vote, as the market could remain nervous and Bitcoin prices could fluctuate if lawmakers delay or contest the vote. They will also study how other cryptocurrencies behave in the first 24 to 72 hours after the government officially reopens and monitor trading volumes, as they represent the confidence among traders.

While this has negatively impacted markets, including cryptocurrencies, the long-awaited agreement may finally be coming. The first step toward reopening the government has been taken, with the US Senate passing a temporary funding bill that will fund the government until January, according to The Block. The bill passed with 60 votes in favor and 40 against. This decision followed reports that senators had reached a partial deal to end the government shutdown. Fourteen previous Senate votes failed to meet the 60 votes needed to enact the budget bill. While there are still hurdles to overcome, this vote paves the way for the shutdown to end by the end of this week. The bill must pass the House of Representatives before it goes to US President Donald Trump's desk for signature. As you may recall, Donald Trump also stated that he believed the shutdown would end soon. Bitcoin and Altcoins Started the New Week with an Uptrend! Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and altcoins are on the rise, fueled by renewed optimism in global markets following news that the government shutdown in the US may soon end. Bitcoin rose 4.5% in the last 24 hours to $106,100, while Ethereum rose 6.5% to $3,600. XRP gained 8.4%, BNB gained 3%, and Solana gained 7%. Peter Chung, Head of Research at Presto Research, said the positive political move from the Senate has helped ease recent market pressures. “The prolonged closure reduced market liquidity and exacerbated market tensions over the past few weeks,” Chung said. “However, the fact that this situation is now fading paves the way for risk assets to price in a positive macro environment, namely looser monetary policy, the end of trade disputes, and ahead of next year's midterm elections.” Vincent Liu, chief investment officer at Kronos Research, also said that the rise in Bitcoin and altcoins was helped by decreasing macro uncertainty and renewed policy optimism. *This is not investment advice.

Trump, in a post on Truth Social, said most citizens, except high-income Americans, will receive payments of at least $2,000. Trump stated that the US has collected “trillions of dollars” in tariffs, adding that these revenues would be used both to reduce the $37 trillion national debt and to give citizens “the rewards they deserve.” While praising the country's economic outlook, Trump lashed out at those criticizing the tariffs, calling them “idiots.” Chart showing the reaction of the BTC price to the Covid incentives announced at the end of 2020.

He also said that investment in the country and factory construction across the country are at a “historic peak.” In the same series of statements, Trump also addressed Republicans, stating that the lengthy government shutdowns that have led to the shutdown should be abolished. He argued that Republicans should shorten the process, reopen the government, and win the upcoming midterm elections by “passing big things.” *This is not investment advice.

The gap between online popularity and real-world connection remains wide – and ripe for innovation. This is precisely where SACHI steps in. The platform introduces a pioneering framework that fuses the viral energy of the creator economy with the unrepeatable spontaneity that defines legendary nightlife. It’s a cultural bridge between digital influence and physical experience, built to empower creators while captivating their audiences in completely new ways. At first glance, SACHI might appear to be simply another event collective tailored to modern tastes – and that’s partly true. But the vision goes far beyond that. SACHI is designing the infrastructure for a new era of audience conversion, loyalty, and community, embodied in what it calls “Creator-First Nightlife.” Redefining the Residency: Spikes for Conversion Bursts At the core of SACHI’s Creator-First Nightlife concept lies its innovative approach to the Residency . Traditionally, clubs and venues rely on resident performers to maintain steady, predictable turnouts night after night. SACHI reimagines this model by tapping into the built-in audiences of leading DJs, streamers, and influencers, creating events that pulse with high energy and full-capacity crowds. “The key insight is that a creator’s audience arrives in spikes – when a live stream starts, when a new track drops, or when a major announcement hits,” explains Jonas Martišius, CEO of SACHI. “Our Residencies are engineered to harness these moments, transforming them into premium, time-sensitive experiences that drive powerful conversion bursts. It’s as much about brand momentum as it is about unforgettable nights.” This precision-driven strategy ensures that while attendees may initially “come for the DJ,” the experience keeps them engaged long after, fostering loyalty to the broader SACHI community and nightlife culture. From Viewer to Regular: Unlocking Token-Gated Nights SACHI has created an ecosystem built to keep audiences coming back for more – because every experience here is designed to feel one of a kind. The ongoing demand to enter these premium spaces becomes a natural incentive, pushing fans to secure project-issued or community-earned tokens that grant access to SACHI’s exclusive Token-Gated Nights. These Token-Gated Nights represent a crossover of cutting-edge Web3 technology with the timeless appeal of high-profile residencies. In this system, digital tokens function as proof of membership – credentials that grant entry into real-world sections where unforgettable, once-in-a-lifetime experiences await. Participation can be as simple as following or subscribing to a creator online, making access both rewarding and attainable. Token-gating serves as a frictionless on-ramp, transforming a viewer’s admiration for a creator into tangible privileges that establish their place within SACHI’s exclusive communities. These tokens can unlock special privileges such as artist meet-and-greets, VIP seating, or priority access to upcoming events. Through this tiered structure, SACHI builds both anticipation and loyalty. At its core, this system turns quick social media interactions into real community connections. SACHI is redefining how audiences connect with creators, turning engagement into equity, and participation into belonging. “We’re giving the audience a piece of the action – a verifiable stake in the scene they’re helping to build,” said Jonas Martisius, CEO of SACHI. “It’s not just about controlling entry; it’s about acknowledging passion, rewarding dedication, and turning casual viewers into lifelong insiders.” The Blueprint for the Future of Creator-Led Entertainment SACHI believes that the future of entertainment involves the complete integration of performers and their audiences into wholesome, shared experiences. It is now providing a framework that converts audience loyalty and interactions with their favorite creators into a mutually beneficial environment where creators gain a reliable, high-impact venue for growth and monetization, while token-holding communities enjoy unique experiences. The key message is clear: The era of passive viewing is over. SACHI is building the active, engaged, and token-gated nightlife of tomorrow.

CoinShares’ XRPL, Franklin’s XRPZ, 21Shares’ TOXR, Canary’s XRPC, and Bitwise’s XRP ETF (XRP) are expected to hit the U.S. market by the end of November. The DTCC list, last updated on Friday, includes both active ETFs that may be processed at the DTCC and pre-launch ETFs that cannot yet be processed at the DTCC. Pre-launch ETFs usually lack the necessary regulatory and other approvals. Cryptopolitan reported nearly a week ago that XRP ETFs are expected to be launched in the U.S. within the next two weeks. U.S. SEC filings reveal that multiple XRP ETF products are in the pipeline, and the removal delay clauses (in S-1s) suggest that their approval is almost guaranteed. Cryptopolitan also noted that REX-Osprey’s XRPR ETF is already active in the U.S. markets, and rising XRP ETF speculation has created a market opportunity for XRP Tundra. Geraci predicts XRP ETFs could start launching this week Nate Geraci, co-founder of the ETF Institute, stated earlier today that the end of the government shutdown means the floodgates for spot crypto ETFs are opening. He pointed out that the first ‘33 Act spot XRP ETF could be launched as early as this week. In last week’s ETF buzz, Geraci disclosed that Canary’s spot XRP ETF is coming soon, maybe by the end of this week. Canary Capital filed with the U.S. SEC on November 8, seeking to list and trade on The Nasdaq. CoinDesk Indices calculate the Pricing Benchmark based on a 60-minute time-weighted average price of the XRP-USD CCIXber Reference Rate. The Trust also intends to have both Gemini and BitGo as its XRP custodians. Geraci also mentioned that WisdomTree has filed for the CoinDesk 20 ETF, which will hold 20 of the largest crypto assets by market cap that are eligible for inclusion in the index. XRP is expected to account for nearly 19.6% of the total holdings. “Sometime in the next two weeks, I expect the launch of first spot xrp ETFs…SEC had open litigation against Ripple for the past five years, up until three months ago…IMO, launch of spot xrp ETFs represents final nail in coffin of previous anti-crypto regulators.” – Nate Geraci , Co-founder of the ETF Institute Geraci’s weekly ETF buzz revealed that October saw a record month of 136 ETF launches. However, Roundhill CEO Dave Mazza noted that it is difficult for small, upstart issuers to survive in the ETF Terrordome, emphasizing that this fact is well documented. Schwab says investors are flooding into ETFs Charles Schwab’s latest ETF study suggests that nearly 62% of investors can envision putting all their money into ETFs. Half (50%) said they could be fully invested in ETFs in the next five years. Schwab believes this signals growing affinity for and reliance on ETFs to meet a range of investment needs. Meanwhile, Schwab observed that 66% of the respondents who participated in the study started investing in ETFs within the past five years. The majority of investors (~94%) also agreed that ETFs help them maintain low costs within their portfolios. Another 46% said ETFs offered access to asset classes that would otherwise be inaccessible. David Botset, Managing Director, Head of Strategy, Innovation, and Stewardship at Schwab Asset Management, asserted that the world of investing is undergoing a rapid transformation. He particularly pointed out that ETF investors are at the forefront of this evolving landscape. Botset believes many investors are using ETFs, which now outnumber individual U.S. stocks, for low-cost core portfolio investments. He also claimed that 48% of ETF investors want to be in fixed income allocations. Get seen where it counts.

54224740,624359,1762754404,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54224740.jpeg,Why Are Bitcoin OGs Dumping Billions Of Dollars In BTC?,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-ogs-dumping-btc/,"A recent report from Bitcoinist highlighted a disturbing trend among early Bitcoin investors that could explain why the cryptocurrency’s price has been in a perpetual state of decline. According to data from on-chain data analytics platforms, these early Bitcoin whales , who hold thousands of BTC, had begun selling their considerable stash. But even after a month of consistent dumping, it seems these large investors are far from done, and more pain could be ahead. Bitcoin Whales Dump Billions Of Dollars On The Market As the Bitcoinist report showed, two early Bitcoin whales began moving their holdings into centralized exchanges back in October. This selling continued into the new month, and by the first week of November, these two whales had sent more than 16,000 BTC to exchanges. In total, the value of the BTC came out to over $1.7 billion, showing the considerable sell pressure that Bitcoin had faced at the time. Following these initial sell-offs into the start of November, there seemed to be a slowdown in the selling , but this did not last very long. On-chain data platform Lookonchain reported that the whales were back at it once again, and this time, one of the whales had returned and looks to be selling the rest of their holdings. Bitcoin OG Owen Gunden is at the center of all of this selling, recently moving the last of his considerable Bitcoin holdings onto a centralized exchange. In total, Gunden sent 3,549 BTC worth $362.84 million at the time of the transaction to the Kraken exchange, after previously sending out 600 BTC worth $61.17 million. In total, Gunden has sent 11,000 BTC worth $1.12 billion to exchanges, presumably to sell . Why The Selling Is Ramping Up With these early Bitcoin whales on the move and triggering significant selling pressure on the market, the question has been why these investors are choosing to sell now after waiting for all of this time. This comes as the $100,000 level remains threatened, and these billion-dollar sell-offs could trigger a bear market. While crypto community members look for some deep meaning in the sell-offs, crypto influencer Udi Wertheimer gave a short and precise answer: the OGs are simply taking profit. These whales had bought their BTC when it was dirt cheap and have held onto their stash for around 15 years. Having grown considerably since then, with most becoming billionaires, it is only natural for these whales to sell and cash out their profits. Instead of asking why the whales are selling, Wertheimer explains that what investors should really be asking is “why is btc price not down -70% when so many OGs are selling?” Given the strength that Bitcoin is demonstrating amid the selling, the crypto influencer believes “that’s what should keep the bears up at night.”",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-10 06:00:04

On-chain data showed that the ETF recorded individual net purchases of 28 billion Korean won on its establishment day. The ACE U.S. AI Tech Core Industry Active ETF also surpassed cumulative individual net purchases of 76 billion Korean won within five days of listing. A source from Korea Investment Management argued that the evolution of AI technology is a structural renewal across industries, which is already deeply permeating every aspect of daily life. He also told local media that investing in the AI sector is no longer a question of whether to invest but what and how to invest. Korea Investment Management’s ETF encompasses the entire AI value chain According to Korea Investment Management, the ACE U.S. AI Tech Core Industry Active ETF captures the industrial technological shift driven by artificial intelligence. The firm also acknowledged that the fund dynamically adjusts investment weights across four core industries, including computing infrastructure, AI hardware, energy infrastructure, and AI software. The investment manager noted that the AI industry has an ecosystem where leading sectors change at each stage of development. The firm confirmed that its ETF encompasses the entire AI value chain and reflects market trends as well. “AI, big tech, and semiconductors are not short-term trend sectors but megatrends fundamentally transforming industrial structures. Broad benefits are expected from AI infrastructure to application stages, and their influence will grow as changes accelerate.” – Nam Yong-soo , Head of ETF Management Division at Korea Investment Management. Yong-soo also revealed that ACE ETFs categorizes market trends into core axes to design investment areas. He added that the fund will continue to present strategic alternatives tailored to investor demand.

Korea Investment Management strengthens its focus on U.S. tech The firm revealed that the fund focuses its investments in seven major U.S. tech giants, including Google, NVIDIA, Apple, and Microsoft. According to the investment manager, the ETF also captures key growth drivers in the tech space, such as cloud, AI, data centers, and platform business. On-chain data revealed that the ETF has seen continuous capital inflows since its listing in September 2023. The fund recorded a net cumulative individual net purchase of 124 billion Korean won since the start of 2025. The fund has also had 16 consecutive days of individual net purchases and stable returns. On-chain data showed that the ETF recorded a 6-month return of 45.28%, a 1-year return of 45.55%, and a post-listing return of 129.61%.

Korea Investment Management believes that semiconductors are a core infrastructure industry connected to AI, data centers, and automotive electronics.

What makes this chart stand out is the structural change identified by The Great Mattsby, who noted that XRP is exhibiting behavior never before seen in its price history. According to Mattsby, “The 3-month Ichimoku Cloud demonstrates how powerful $XRP’s bull trend actually is.” $XRP : Further Bullish Signals https://t.co/vyjqqFrVhe pic.twitter.com/Brl3jAyoje — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) November 8, 2025 XRP’s New Bullish Indicator He explained that XRP “has never built a base above the 3-month conversion or baseline in its history, and it’s doing it now for the past year.” This development, highlighted in the chart, represents a critical phase for the cryptocurrency. The Ichimoku Cloud’s conversion and baseline lines often act as dynamic support and resistance levels. Sustained price action above these levels is generally interpreted as confirmation of bullish strength. The current chart shows XRP maintaining its structure above both lines for the past four consecutive quarters. Historically, such positioning has not occurred for the token, which previously struggled to establish stability above these mid-term indicators during prior market cycles. This shift suggests that the asset has transitioned from reactive rallies to a more defined structural uptrend . What the Indicator Suggests for XRP’s Momentum The Ichimoku Cloud model is designed to show equilibrium within the market. When price action remains above the conversion and baseline for an extended period, it typically signals control by buyers and indicates that pullbacks are being absorbed. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 For XRP, maintaining this position across multiple quarterly candles highlights the possibility of a new long-term base forming. This setup means XRP may be in the early stages of a sustained expansion. The three-month timeframe adds weight to the analysis, as longer intervals filter out short-term volatility and highlight genuine directional strength. Should XRP continue to hold above the baseline, traders could see the next major test around prior resistance zones near the $3 area. Looking Ahead This configuration also offers insight into XRP’s potential resilience against broader market fluctuations. If the price remains supported above these key Ichimoku levels, it could provide a technical foundation for further growth. While shorter-term corrections are always possible, maintaining structure above these support regions tends to attract more institutional and long-term interest . With XRP trading around $2.46, analysts are closely monitoring whether the asset can preserve this structural base through the coming months.

The announcement came Friday from China’s Ministry of Commerce, and it follows the October 30 meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Busan, South Korea, where both sides agreed to slow down their long-running trade fight. The suspended restrictions, which were first introduced on October 9, had placed tight controls on rare earth elements, lithium battery materials, and industrial processing technologies, which are all critical to both military hardware and the semiconductor industry. China halts dual-use material controls after Busan meeting As part of the same trade de-escalation, Beijing has reversed its December 2024 decision to restrict the export of key high-strength materials, including antimony, synthetic diamonds, and boron nitrides, in addition to gallium and germanium. These materials fall under China’s category of dual-use items, meaning they can be used in both civilian products and military systems. Their previous restriction was a direct response to Washington’s broader semiconductor export bans. China also suspended strict checks that had been introduced on exports of graphite, rules that required U.S. buyers to explain exactly how and where the materials would be used. That rule, which came into effect last December, had made life harder for American companies needing the mineral for electric vehicle production and missile guidance systems. Those checks are now also on pause for a year. These export relaxations don’t just happen out of nowhere. China controls a majority of the world’s production of critical minerals and rare earths, and it has used that dominance to push back during trade fights. By pausing these restrictions, Beijing is temporarily lowering its weapon of economic leverage in exchange for U.S. concessions. U.S. drops shipbuilding probe, China shelves port fee plan While the minerals story grabbed headlines, the trade deal also included another major concession: Donald Trump’s administration has frozen its investigation into China’s shipbuilding industry. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) said in a statement that the probe was suspended at midnight Monday, with talks set to continue on unresolved issues. The USTR did not specify what those unresolved issues were, but said further discussions with Beijing will take place over the next twelve months. Shortly after that, China’s Ministry of Transport followed up with its own announcement, confirming it was also putting its retaliatory measures on ice. That included halting a plan to impose extra port fees on vessels coming from the U.S., which had been scheduled to kick in this quarter. These twin decisions remove immediate cost pressures for companies shipping goods between both countries. If the planned port fees had gone into effect, it would’ve raised freight costs and disrupted deliveries of key global commodities like oil , not to mention commercial goods. The fee standoff had originally started in mid-October, when China announced its maritime investigation in direct response to the U.S. launching its own. In addition to lifting those probes, Washington agreed to delay a September 29 rule that would’ve blacklisted Chinese firms’ subsidiaries by placing them on the U.S. entity list. This move blocks them from doing business with American suppliers. That rule has now been shelved, for the time being, as part of the broader understanding reached in Busan. On the tariff side, Trump agreed to slash duties on Chinese imports by 10 percentage points, and to keep his “reciprocal tariffs,” originally scheduled to ramp up again, on hold until November 10, 2026. That decision removes a key pressure point that’s been weighing on tech companies, manufacturers, and the global supply chain.

Sentiment improved after China’s October consumer prices unexpectedly rose 0.2% y/y, the first gain since June, fueled by holiday spending and expanded trade-in programs. The record-breaking U.S. government shutdown is nearing an end after moderate Senate Democrats agreed to back a deal to reopen the government and fund key departments, Bloomberg News reported on Monday. Gold rose more than 1% to around $4,050 per ounce on Monday, reaching a two-week-high amid mounting concerns over the US economy. The annual inflation rate in Bangladesh fell to 8.17% in October 2025 from 8.36% in the previous month, marking the lowest reading since July 2022. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 1.33% to above 50,500, while the broader Topix Index added 0.5% to 3,315 on Monday, recovering part of last week’s losses. The Japanese yen depreciated toward 154 per dollar on Monday, nearing nine-month lows, amid expectations that the new administration will push for a massive stimulus package and support accommodative monetary policy. The Bank of Japan signaled that it may continue to gradually raise interest rates as economic activity and prices improve, but emphasized caution amid persistent uncertainties, according to the summary of opinions from its October meeting. The Japanese government is expected to finalise an economic stimulus package on November 21, marking Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s first major policy initiative since taking office last month. Japan’s leading economic index — which gauges the outlook for the coming months based on indicators such as job offers and consumer sentiment — rose to 108.0 in September 2025 from August’s five-month low of 107.0, preliminary estimates showed. Japan’s coincident economic index, which tracks key indicators including factory output, employment, and retail sales, rose to 114.6 in September 2025 from 112.8 in the previous month. China ( SHCOMP ) rose 0.47% to around 3,995 while the Shenzhen Component lost 0.4% to 13,350 on Monday, with mainland stocks sliding for the second straight session as stronger-than-expected inflation data dampened hopes for near-term policy support, and the offshore yuan remained around 7.12 per dollar, trading in a sideways range. China's consumer price index showed unexpected strength in October 2025, rising 0.2% year-over-year (Y/Y). Meanwhile, deflationary pressure at the factory gate continued to ease. China’s Producer Price Index declined 2.1% Y/Y in October. Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, also accelerated, rising 1.2% Y/Y. Within the CPI data, food prices fell 2.9% Y/Y, which represents an easing from the 4.4% drop in September. China has granted exemptions to export controls on Nexperia chips for civilian applications, the commerce ministry said on Sunday, in a move that will help relieve supply shortages for carmakers and automotive suppliers, Reuters reported. Separately, China has suspended its ban on approving exports of “dual-use items” related to gallium, germanium, antimony, and super-hard materials to the United States, the Commerce Ministry said on Sunday. Hong Kong ( HSI ) rose 1.56% to 26,352 in Monday morning trade, rebounding from prior losses as consumer and property stocks led gains. India ( SENSEX ) rose 0.52% to 83,424 in morning trade on Monday, erasing losses from the previous three sessions. Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.75% to close at 8,836 on Monday, recouping about half of last week's losses, with commodity-linked stocks leading the rebound amid stronger underlying prices. The Australian dollar climbed above $0.65, nearing one-week highs, after Reserve Bank of Australia Deputy Governor Andrew Hauser noted that monetary policy faces an unusual challenge and emphasized the need to keep policy tight to contain inflation. Australia’s monetary policy faces a tricky phase as the economy’s recovery began with demand already exceeding potential output, leaving little room for near-term easing, the Reserve Bank Deputy Governor Andrew Hauser said in a speech on Monday. Private house approvals in Australia grew 4.0% month-on-month to 9,547 units in September 2025, rebounding from a 1.0% fall in the previous month and confirming preliminary estimates. The seasonally adjusted number of total dwellings approved in Australia climbed 12% month-on-month to 17,019 units in September 2025, matching preliminary estimates and rebounding from a 3.6% fall in August. In the U.S. on Friday, all three major indexes rebounded from early losses to close mostly higher on Friday amid hopes that Congress members were making progress toward ending the government shutdown. U.S. stock futures advanced on Monday after the Senate passed the initial stage of a deal to end the government shutdown, securing the minimum 60 votes required, with eight Democratic senators breaking from party leadership: Dow +0.28% ; S&P 500 +0.73% ; Nasdaq +1.27% .

Given this trend, the expectations are that the cryptocurrency could be getting ready for another rally like the last two bear markets. Even though the year 2025 is about to come to an end and there has been no such rally in sight, it has not dimmed bullishness among investors. Analyst Predicts 3rd Wave For Dogecoin Price Pseudonymous crypto analyst EtherNaysyonal shared an analysis with the Dogecoin community that shows where they expect the DOGE price to be headed next. This analysis focuses on the sudden explosive bull runs that have happened in the Dogecoin lifetime, predicting the next one that could send the meme coin toward new all-time highs. Related Reading: Big Bitcoin Holders Are Selling, But Few Buyers Are Stepping In As Demand Weakens Highlighting the previous performances, the crypto analyst shows how the Dogecoin price has consolidated for a long time before reaching an end in 2017. Once this bottom was established, the price saw an over 7,000% increase, rising from below $0.00028 to over $0.02 before the bear market began in 2018. Next came another long consolidation trend that spanned years before ending in 2021. Just like the performance in 2021, the end case for the 2021 rally was similar, which was an explosive rally. The Dogecoin price increased from below $0.0028 to over $0.7, registering an over 30,000% increase by the time the run was completed. Pointing to these previous performances, the analyst believes that Dogecoin may be on the verge of another major run. If the price sees a similar bounce, then the analyst believes that the meme coin’s price will cross $1. By the time it’s done, it could see an over 1,200% increase, causing the price to reach $2.2 before the momentum fades. The Evolution Of DOGE The analysis comes in response to a previous post that EtherNaysyonal had made, showing how Dogecoin has managed to evolve from a joke into a serious cryptocurrency. They explain that the existence of DOGE shows that money doesn’t always have to be serious. Related Reading: $300 Million Worth Of XRP On The Move – Where Are They Headed? Despite starting out as a joke, though, Dogecoin has since grown beyond that and has seen some major developments that solidified its position in the market. Just like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and XRP, Dogecoin is one of the few cryptocurrencies out of millions to be used as a reserve currency by companies. There have also been several ETF filings for Dogecoin as it is being moved into the mainstream for institutional participation. DOGE has also been incorporated into the likes of Tesla as a payment method for merchandise, expanding its reach.

Key Takeaways: Ledger is planning a New York listing or private fundraise next year as demand for crypto security devices reaches record highs. The company’s 2025 revenues hit triple-digit millions, securing about $100 billion in Bitcoin for customers worldwide. Rising crypto thefts exceeding $2.1 billion this year are driving investors toward Ledger’s cold storage wallets for safer asset protection. Chief executive Pascal Gauthier said Ledger is exploring both a potential US listing and a private funding round, as the company expands its presence in New York, according to a report from the Financial Times . “Money is in New York today for crypto, it’s nowhere else in the world, certainly not in Europe,” Gauthier told the paper, noting that investor appetite for digital asset infrastructure remains stronger in the United States. Ledger Revenue Hits Triple-Digit Millions as It Secures $100B in Bitcoin Ledger’s revenues have already hit triple-digit millions in 2025, marking its best performance to date — and that figure is expected to grow further as the company enters its peak season during Black Friday and the holiday shopping period. The Paris-based firm, founded in 2014, currently secures around $100 billion worth of Bitcoin on behalf of customers and was last valued at $1.5 billion following a 2023 funding round backed by 10T Holdings and True Global Ventures. The renewed investor interest in crypto security comes amid an alarming rise in digital thefts. Criminals stole $2.17 billion worth of digital assets in the first half of 2025 alone, surpassing the total for all of 2024, according to data from Chainalysis. As the wave of cybercrime intensifies, more retail and institutional investors are turning to cold storage wallets like those produced by Ledger, Trezor, and Tangem for protection. LATEST: Ledger is considering an IPO in New York following triple-digit million-dollar revenues in 2025, driven by escalating crypto security threats, CEO Pascal Gauthier told the Financial Times. pic.twitter.com/xj7grmeg4J — CoinMarketCap (@CoinMarketCap) November 9, 2025 Ledger has also been expanding its product line, launching an iOS app for enterprise users and adding native TRON support. However, its new multisig wallet feature has drawn mixed feedback from developers and long-time customers over transaction fees. The rise in security concerns extends beyond the digital realm. Earlier this year, Ledger co-founder David Balland was kidnapped in France, with attackers demanding a €10 million crypto ransom before being captured in Morocco. Despite the risks, Gauthier says Ledger’s mission remains unchanged: securing users’ digital wealth as crypto adoption accelerates globally. Crypto Crime Turns Violent as Illicit Transactions Top $40B in 2024 Illicit cryptocurrency activity surged to at least $40.9 billion in 2024, according to Chainalysis, with the number likely to grow as more criminal-linked wallets are identified. Hacks alone accounted for $2.2 billion in stolen assets, a 21% increase from the previous year. North Korean-linked groups, including Lazarus and Tradetraitor, were behind over 60% of those thefts, with major incidents like the $300 million hack of Japan’s DMM Bitcoin exchange among their hits. However, the threats go beyond online exploits. Criminal groups are using crypto to fund and conceal a wider range of crimes, from investment scams and AI-enhanced romance frauds to drug trafficking and even physical violence. In one alarming case on May 13, 2025, the daughter and grandson of Paymium’s CEO were nearly kidnapped in Paris by masked men.

Aside from the massive double-digit gainers from the mid-tear club, XRP stands out as the top gainer from the largest 10 alts. So, why is this, and can the asset sustain its upward move? ETF-Driven Hype? Citing information from Glassnode, we reported yesterday that XRP has shown some warning signs in terms of profit-taking divergance from previous cycles, as long-term holders were disposing of their tokens during price corrections this time, not just rallies. This, aligned with whales selling off XRP en masse, spelled trouble for the underlying asset, which had already retraced to under $2.20 at the time. However, what took place in the following 12 hours was quite different. On the heels of Trump’s $2,000 dividend promise and his hopeful statement that the US government might reopen soon, XRP jumped by more than 7% and neared $2.50 earlier this morning. This makes it the top performer from the largest 15 altcoins, according to CoinGecko data. Perhaps a large portion of those gains are due to the latest developments on the ETF front. Numerous issuers continue to update their XRP ETF filings, and those from Bitwise, Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, Canary Capital, and CoinShares have now found a spot on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation’s (DTCC) listings. If the US government’s shutdown indeed ends soon, it could open the doors for a speedy approval of these applications. However, even if it’s not, many of them removed the “delayment amendments” part, which could essentially guarantee that they will launch within the next few weeks unless the SEC formally objects. The first can see the light of day in just three days. XRP Technicals Popular analyst CW indicated that XRP’s turn is “beginning,” as it had “bottomed out” and is about to stage a notable rebound. Their analysis suggests that the asset’s upcoming rally could be quite spectacular, leading to a new all-time high as it progresses toward the top of Phase 4. $XRP ‘s turn is beginning. It has bottomed out and is beginning a rebound. This rally will likely surpass its ATH and head towards the top of Phase 4. pic.twitter.com/ZxTn0Dtdf4 — CW (@CW8900) November 9, 2025 CRYPTOWZRD also outlined XRP’s “slightly bullish” close, especially against BTC. The analyst said another move higher could follow once the XRP/BTC pair starts pushing above the daily lower high trend. This is possible when bitcoin’s dominance starts to decline again.

Lee Eok-won, Chairman of the Financial Services Commission (FSC), recently presented three fundamental criteria that must guide how stablecoins enter mainstream finance. This announcement comes at a pivotal moment when global regulators are racing to establish frameworks for these digital assets. Why Does Stablecoin Adoption Need Clear Guidelines? Stablecoins represent one of cryptocurrency’s most promising innovations, but their potential impact on financial systems demands careful regulation. The FSC Chairman emphasized that proper stablecoin adoption requires balancing innovation with protection. During his budget review presentation before the National Assembly, Lee outlined how these digital assets could transform financial services while maintaining system integrity. What Are the Three Pillars of Stablecoin Adoption? The FSC Chairman identified three critical considerations that must guide stablecoin adoption frameworks: Global Consistency: Stablecoin systems must align with international standards and keep pace with worldwide regulatory trends Innovation Enablement: Regulations should foster creative uses and applications of stablecoin technology System Stability: Implementation must include robust safeguards to protect financial markets How Will Global Consistency Shape Stablecoin Adoption? Lee stressed that successful stablecoin adoption requires harmonization with international standards. This approach prevents regulatory arbitrage and ensures that South Korea remains competitive in the global digital economy. The Chairman noted that isolated national frameworks could hinder cross-border transactions and limit the potential benefits of stablecoin adoption. Can Innovation and Regulation Coexist in Stablecoin Adoption? The FSC recognizes that excessive regulation could stifle the very innovation that makes stablecoins valuable. Therefore, the framework for stablecoin adoption must enable diverse use cases while maintaining necessary controls. This balanced approach allows developers to explore new applications while ensuring consumer protection remains paramount. What Safeguards Are Essential for Stablecoin Adoption? Given stablecoins’ potential to significantly impact financial stability, the FSC Chairman emphasized that any framework for stablecoin adoption must include: Robust reserve requirements Transparent auditing processes Clear redemption mechanisms Comprehensive risk management protocols How Will These Criteria Transform Stablecoin Adoption? The three criteria establish a comprehensive foundation for responsible stablecoin adoption. By addressing global alignment, innovation potential, and systemic protection simultaneously, South Korea positions itself as a thoughtful leader in cryptocurrency regulation. This approach could serve as a model for other nations developing their own stablecoin frameworks. The FSC’s clear guidelines provide much-needed direction for businesses and investors interested in stablecoin adoption. As the global community watches South Korea’s regulatory development, these principles may influence international standards and shape how stablecoins integrate into mainstream finance worldwide. Frequently Asked Questions What are stablecoins? Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to reserve assets like fiat currencies or commodities. Why is stablecoin regulation important? Proper regulation ensures that stablecoins don’t threaten financial stability while still enabling innovation and consumer protection. How do South Korea’s guidelines compare to other countries? South Korea’s approach emphasizes global consistency, making it more likely to align with emerging international standards than country-specific frameworks. When will these stablecoin guidelines take effect? The guidelines were presented during 2026 budget discussions, suggesting implementation could begin within the next few years. Can individuals use stablecoins under these guidelines? Yes, the framework aims to enable various uses while ensuring proper safeguards are in place for all participants. How will this affect existing cryptocurrency markets? Clear stablecoin regulations typically increase market confidence and could lead to greater institutional participation.

TIA’s price is attempting to hold above $1 as buyers gained confidence, resulting in a push above Fib channels. Will the TIA price reach $100?

This suggests that new all-time highs for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies might occur around 2025. Considering this, along with the ongoing development of the Celestia network and the growing adoption of modular blockchain technology, the outlook appears positive for the year ahead. Based on a deep technical analysis of past TIA price data, the price of Celestia is predicted to reach a minimum level of $1, a potential maximum of $1.5, and an average trading price of $1.3 in 2025.

This surge happened amid optimism that the US government shutdown would end soon. This article explores forecasts for some of the top gainers in the crypto market like Decred (DCR), Zcash (ZEC), Starknet (STRK), and World Liberty Financial (WLFI). Decred price forecast Decred price surged in the past few days, making it one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies. It was trading at $36 today, up by 65% from its lowest level on Saturday. Decred, which was built by the same team that built Monero, has surged because of the ongoing demand for privacy tokens. Its main feature is that it uses a hybrid proof-of-stake and proof-of-work. The daily timeframe chart shows that the DCR price remained in a consolidation phase for months as its volume remained low. This consolidation ended in October when the token went parabolic, reaching a high of $70, up by 342% from its lowest level in October. Decred price then plunged to $22 on November 8 and has now rebounded to the current $37. It has moved above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA), a sign that bulls remain in control. Decred remains above the Ichimoku cloud and the Supertrend indicators. Therefore, the most likely scenario is where it continues to ride the Zcash wave and hit the important resistance level at $50. A move below the support at $24 will invalidate the bullish outlook. Decred price chart | Source: TradingView Zcash price prediction Zcash price has been the best-performing cryptocurrency this year, rising from $30 in August to a high of $740. This surge was driven by the recent launch of a fund tracking the token, which has now accumulated over $150 million in assets. The rally then accelerated after bullish statements by some notable analysts and investors, including Arthur Hayes, who predicted that it would surge to $1000 over time. In a recent statement, Nansen analysts explained the surge, noting the it was like an encrypted Bitcoin because of its advanced privacy features. Zcash price has moved above all moving averages, and is in an extended markup phase of the Wyckoff Theory. This phase is characterized by the Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) and increased buying the dip. The coin has now moved into the overbought level as the Relative Strength Index and the Stochastic Oscillator have continued rising. Therefore, while the token may keep rising, there is an elevated risk that it may pull back in the near term as investors book profits. Zcash price chart | Source: TradingView Starknet price prediction Starknet is a top player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry, where it offers a platform for monetizing Bitcoin. It allows Bitcoin holders to generate a return, pay, and borrow using their Bitcoin. It has over $335 million in total value locked. The token has jumped despite the unlock that will increase the supply by 163 million tokens valued at $28 million. Starknet price rose as it remains in a tight range between the support and resistance levels at $0.1040 and $0.1965. There are signs that it is in the accumulation phase of the Wyckoff Theory, which may trigger a strong bullish breakout, potentially to the psychological level at $0.50. Starknet price chart | Source: TradingView WLFI price forecast The World Liberty Financial token has been in a strong uptrend in the past few days, moving from a low of $0.072 on October 11 to a high of $0.1697 today. It has jumped to the highest level since October 10. The token has moved above the important resistance level at $0.1560, its highest level on October 29. It also moved between the 38.2% and 50% Fibonacci Retracement levels. WLFI price chart | Source: TradingView WLFI price has moved above the 50-period and 100-period Exponential Moving Averages. It will likely continue rising as bulls target the key resistance level at $0.200.

National Court Judge José Luis Calama ordered his arrest without bail after finding a secret Singapore account containing 29 million euros ($33.5 million) connected to the scheme. According to Cadena SER, a national news outlet, Romillo was detained on Thursday because prosecutors feared he would flee the country. Judge José Luis Calama stated that Romillo might be sentenced to 9 years in prison, and even up to 18 years in prison if it is considered that the defrauding constitutes a mass offense. Romillo’s MIC allegedly duped investors of millions In late 2024, Spanish authorities began investigating MIC, and in October of that same year, they reported three complaints. The Central Operational Unit of Spain’s Civil Guard (UCO) believes that Romillo’s MIC allegedly operated a Ponzi scheme that defrauded 3,000 people of €260 million (approximately $300 million). According to Zaballos Abogados, a Spanish law firm, Romillo has assisted law enforcement over the past year by attending court proceedings. He also assisted the authorities in recovering assets, including high-end vehicles. Zalaballos Abogados reported that the National Police and the Public Prosecutor’s Office of the National Court seized a total of twenty-four luxury vehicles registered to one of the firms. The authorities seized three more luxury vehicles registered to another company inside the MIC network. Each car had been uniquely identifiable by its chassis number and registration plate. The Spanish law firm stated that a Mercedes-Benz S650 Maybach, a Ferrari Testarossa, a Ferrari 430 Scuderia, a Ferrari 365 GTC4, a Ferrari F131, several Jaguars, numerous Porsches, BMWs, a Ford Mustang, and other distinctive automobiles of significant economic value were among the vehicles. MIC required deposits (a minimum of €2,000 per investor) with assured buybacks and fixed earnings that were very high, at about 20% annually. The deposits helped MIC to purchase digital “artwork” contracts and shares in luxury items, including yachts, Ferraris, and gold. During his Friday court appearance, Romillo stated that he planned to reimburse investors and had even sent money back to 2,700 parties; however, he did so in cash and claimed he had no method to account for the payments. Romillo’s $115,000 cash handshake sparks election investigation The National Court has an open case against CryptoSpain for allegedly operating a cryptocurrency pyramid scheme . The Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the Civil Guard and the Tax Agency submitted a report to Spain’s National Court Judge José Luis Calama, emphasizing the existence of solid and rational indications of criminality committed by Romillo. The UCO report detailed that last year, Romillo acknowledged using an underhanded cash payment of €100,000 ($115,000) to support the 2024 election campaign of far-right Spanish MEP Luis “Alvise” Pérez, the leader of the SALF party. Pérez is being investigated in a separate instance from the broader MIC investigation. According to a Euro News report, Romillo allegedly handed the money in hard currency to Pérez on 27 May, just days before the European elections. In the report, Pérez allegedly contacted Romillo in March to set up a digital wallet that would enable him to receive “anonymous and encrypted” funding. Pérez acknowledged on Telegram receiving the money “as a freelancer without an invoice,” for which he was fined 25% of the total. According to the report, Pérez claimed that Romillo agreed with the public prosecutor’s office to escape pre-trial imprisonment for fraud by accusing the MEP of accepting the money to support his election campaign. Additionally, Romillo provided documentation demonstrating their continued communication. He claimed Pérez informed him that he required between €300,000 and €360,000 to start his campaign for Brussels. According to Spain’s party financing rules, donations exceeding €25,000 must be disclosed to the Court of Auditors, and donations exceeding €50,000 annually are prohibited.

He also cautioned that traders pressing longs too early should expect one more drive lower into the $1.90 zone before the next leg higher.

The outflows represent the third-largest ever recorded. From November 3 to November 7 (ET), spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a weekly net outflow of $1.22 billion, the third-largest on record.

Spot Solana ETFs posted a weekly net inflow of $137… pic.twitter.com/6QHfqFTsRb — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) November 10, 2025 The funds saw $558.4 million in net outflows on Friday alone, the largest single-day withdrawal since August, per SoSoValue data . This development comes amid ongoing market volatility and macroeconomic pressures. The data revealed that BlackRock’s IBIT fund is the primary contributor to the outflow, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC and Grayscale’s GBTC funds. As of Monday, Bitcoin witnessed a climb above $106,000, up 4.4% in 24 hours, Cryptonews reported . The largest crypto is trading at $ $106,166.5 at press time. ETF Flows Deepen – Long-Term Bearish Signal or short-term Correction? The scale of US Bitcoin Spot ETF outflows offers a clear indication that the sentiment on Bitcoin investment is shifting. Market analysts say that the recent outflows should not be construed as a long-term bearish signal, but a consolidation period. The significant outflows from Bitcoin ETFs indicate that “institutional players are taking profits off the table,” Przemysław Kral, CEO of European crypto exchange zondacrypto, told Cryptonews. Besides, several factors appear to be contributing to the recent withdrawal peak. This includes global economic uncertainties, including inflation rates, interest rate hikes by central banks, and geopolitical tensions that continue to generate waves of risk aversion among investors. Bitfinex analysts argue that the early October Bitcoin move toward $125,000 leaned on strong ETF inflows and that macro shocks plus profit-taking broke the move. “For upside to restart, ETF inflows need to climb back above $1 billion per week and broader macro needs to ease.” Bitcoin Price Slide Vs BTC ETF Outflows BTC spot ETF issuers reported a second consecutive week of outflows in June, followed by the crypto sliding below $100,000. Drawing parallels, BTC ETFs $1.22 billion in weekly net outflows last week, came at the brink of Bitcoin losing below $100,000. Similarly, ETH spot ETF issuers registered net outflows of $508.2 million in the reporting week ending November 7. Ethereum fell to a November 4 low of $3,058 before rebounding above $3,400. The crypto is now trading at $3,614 , a 6% increase in past 24 hours.

Binance Coin ( BNB ) advanced 2.26% to $1,010, and Solana ( SOL ) extended its rally with a 6.05% rise to $167.79. Top cryptocurrency performance. Source: Finbold Why the crypto market is rallying The surge came after reports that U.S. lawmakers had reached a bipartisan deal to end the 40-day government shutdown, easing fears that had rattled global markets for weeks. The shutdown had drained liquidity and delayed the release of key economic data, leaving investors uncertain about the Federal Reserve’s next policy moves. With the prospect of government operations resuming and fresh fiscal spending on the horizon, traders rushed back into risk assets, including digital currencies. Adding to the optimism, a new proposal by President Donald Trump to use tariff revenues to fund $2,000 dividend payments to Americans helped lift sentiment further. The plan, which includes allocating tariff proceeds to partially cover healthcare expenses, is widely viewed as a form of fiscal stimulus likely to boost consumer spending and liquidity, both favorable conditions for risk assets like cryptocurrencies . The comeback follows weeks of heavy outflows from crypto exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ), with over $2.1 billion withdrawn from spot Bitcoin products and $579 million from Ethereum funds over the past eight trading sessions. Indeed, the downturn saw Bitcoin fall below $100,000, with analysts warning that the major digital asset could correct further. However, as things stand, Bitcoin’s next target remains reclaiming the $110,000 mark, provided it holds onto the $105,000 support.

The latest reports reveal that the FTX estate repayment process has successfully distributed $7.1 billion to affected parties, marking a significant milestone in the ongoing bankruptcy proceedings. What Makes This FTX Estate Repayment So Remarkable? The FTX estate repayment story contains several surprising elements that defy typical bankruptcy expectations. Unlike most corporate failures where creditors receive pennies on the dollar, the FTX estate has managed to provide substantial recoveries. The most notable achievement involves smaller creditors receiving more than their original claims. Consider these key highlights from the repayment process: Three successful installment distributions completed Creditors with claims under $50,000 received 119% repayment Interest payments included in the distributions Next distribution scheduled for January 2026 How Did the FTX Estate Achieve This Recovery? The successful FTX estate repayment results from meticulous asset management and strategic liquidation. Bankruptcy administrators have been working tirelessly to identify, secure, and liquidate FTX’s remaining assets. This process involved tracking down cryptocurrency holdings, evaluating company investments, and managing the complex web of international assets. Moreover, the recovery team benefited from several favorable market conditions. The recent cryptocurrency market recovery helped increase the value of remaining digital assets. Additionally, careful timing of asset sales maximized returns for creditors seeking compensation through the FTX estate repayment program. What Does This Mean for Future Distributions? With the next FTX estate repayment scheduled for January 2026, creditors have reason for cautious optimism. The current success suggests that future distributions may continue to exceed initial expectations. However, the complexity of remaining assets and potential legal challenges could impact the timeline and amounts. Key factors influencing future distributions include: Ongoing asset recovery efforts Legal proceedings and settlements Market conditions for remaining cryptocurrency holdings Administrative costs and fees Why Should the Crypto Community Pay Attention? This unprecedented FTX estate repayment sets important precedents for the cryptocurrency industry. It demonstrates that even in cases of catastrophic failure, recovery is possible. The successful distribution of funds provides valuable lessons about asset protection, bankruptcy procedures, and creditor rights in the digital asset space. The process also highlights the importance of proper corporate governance and transparent financial practices. As the industry matures, cases like the FTX estate repayment will help establish standards and expectations for investor protection. Conclusion: A Beacon of Hope in Crypto’s Darkest Hour The remarkable success of the FTX estate repayment process offers hope and valuable lessons for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. While the FTX collapse represented one of the industry’s most significant failures, the ongoing recovery demonstrates resilience and the potential for redemption. The 119% returns for small creditors particularly stand as a testament to what can be achieved through diligent bankruptcy management. Frequently Asked Questions How much has the FTX estate repaid to creditors? The FTX estate has repaid $7.1 billion to creditors across three installments to date. What percentage did small creditors receive? Creditors with claims of $50,000 or less received 119% repayment, including interest. When is the next distribution scheduled? The next FTX estate repayment distribution is scheduled for January 2026. How were such high repayments possible? Successful asset recovery, favorable market conditions, and strategic liquidation contributed to the higher-than-expected returns. Will all creditors receive the same percentage? No, the repayment percentages vary based on claim size and creditor classification within the bankruptcy structure. What happens to remaining FTX assets? Remaining assets continue to be managed and liquidated for future distributions to creditors. Found this update on the FTX estate repayment surprising?

This has naturally raised brand new concerns that demand for AI chips might be cooling as analysts still expect 27.4% growth for the current quarter, though the company’s stock is up 37% year-to-date, showing that investors have mostly stayed optimistic … until now. Just last week, investors dumped tech shares over fears of inflated valuations. Big names on Wall Street flagged a looming correction. One of them was Michael Burry, whose Scion Asset Management revealed bearish bets against Nvidia, the top name in AI chips. Even with that warning bell, the industry keeps pouring billions into AI infrastructure. That includes Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet, who together are set to invest more than $400 billion in 2026, a 21% jump from this year, to stay ahead in the AI race. Huang pushes TSMC for more chips in Taiwan Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, met with TSMC’s chief C.C. Wei during a two-day visit to Taiwan. Huang requested more chip supply, saying his company was “growing month by month, stronger and stronger.” The trip came as demand outstrips supply and all major chip designers are chasing production slots at TSMC’s plants in Hsinchu. Wei told analysts last month that capacity remains tight and the company is still working to balance supply and demand. Nvidia’s competitors, including AMD and Qualcomm, also depend on TSMC for manufacturing. The company also produces custom chips for Apple, including the silicon used in iPhones and other hardware. Qualcomm’s CEO Cristiano Amon told Bloomberg TV that people are still underestimating how huge AI will become. Nvidia blocked in China, political tensions grow Huang’s trip to Taiwan also followed some sharp commentary about the U.S.–China AI conflict. He told the Financial Times that “China will win” due to lower energy costs and friendlier regulations, but later clarified that he was simply pointing out China’s strength in the sector. On Friday in Tainan, he made it clear that Nvidia isn’t trying to restart Blackwell chip sales in China: “There are no active discussions. Currently, we’re not planning to ship anything to China.” Huang has said before that he’d like to grow business in China, but tensions between the U.S. and Chinese governments have stopped that from happening. President Donald Trump mentioned in October that he might bring up the Nvidia–China issue during a meeting with Xi Jinping, but he later backtracked and the topic was never raised. While Washington has allowed Nvidia to sell its H20 chips (a less advanced product) to Chinese buyers, Beijing told domestic firms to avoid foreign chips and stick to local alternatives. Companies like Huawei and Cambricon are pushing hard to build their own AI processors, with backing from the Communist Party, which doesn’t want to depend on American tech. Huang warned that U.S. export rules could actually hurt American companies by pushing China to accelerate its development of rival AI chip technologies. “It’s up to China when they would like Nvidia products to go back to serve the Chinese market,” he said. “I look forward to them changing their policy.” If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Smart investors, however, understand there are legal ways to reduce (or even avoid) paying taxes on their crypto gains in 2025. Whether you’re just trading, staking, or simply HODLing your crypto, understanding how tax rules apply to digital assets can undoubtedly make a huge difference come filing time. In this article, we take a look at 10 entirely legal strategies to decrease or entirely avoid your crypto taxes. These approaches work within the existing regulations set by agencies such as the IRS, the HMRC, ATO, and more. We will also provide easy-to-understand examples and actionable planning advice you can follow step-by-step. Key Takeaways: You can minimize (or avoid) crypto taxes through structure, deductions, and timing. Strategies include offsetting losses, strategic donations, long-term HODLing, and more. Make sure to always document your transactions and consult a tax professional before submitting your tax files. Understanding How Crypto is Taxed in 2025 First things first, before looking into ways to avoid crypto taxes, it’s essential to understand how taxation actually works. In the US, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) classifies cryptocurrency as property, not as a currency. This means that crypto transactions are generally subject to capital gains and income tax. You are not taxed for simply holding your digital assets, but a taxable event takes place every time you sell, swap, spend, or earn crypto through activities such as mining or airdrops. The profits from sales are treated as capital gains – short-term if you have held the asset for less than 12 months, and long-term if that period has been surpassed. Earned cryptocurrency through mining or staking is usually regarded as income based on its fair market value at the time you receive it. When you file your taxes, you have to report your crypto activities on forms such as Form 8949 (for disposals) and Schedule 1 or Schedule C (for income), and also answer the digital asset question on Form 1040. This might be different depending on your jurisdiction, but most of the larger regulators treat crypto as property and not as a currency and the differences will be mostly procedural. New 2025 Crypto Tax Updates There are a few significant changes, especially in the US, that are sort of reshaping the crypto tax landscape. One of the key updates is the rollout of a new form called Form 1099-DA. Since January 1st, 2025, crypto brokers and wallets have to report the gross proceeds of crypto sales and exchanges. Going forward, from January 1st, 2026, these brokers will also have to report the cost basis and the gain/loss data, so you will be receiving that form as well. Additionally, the IRS has also sharpened its focus on cryptocurrencies in a bid to increase scrutiny of DeFi transactions, as well as unreported transactions – this was detailed in a recent update on Digital Assets. Top 11 Ways to Avoid Cryptocurrency Taxes in 2025 Focus on Investing and Avoid Short-Term Capital Gains In many jurisdictions, the duration you hold your cryptocurrencies directly affects the rate of your taxes. Selling your coins within the first 12 months after you have purchased them would most often than not trigger short-term capital gains. These are usually taxed at higher income-tax rates. On the other hand, if you hold your crypto for longer than a year, this would usually qualify you for long-term capital gain rates, which can be 0%, 15%, or 20% in the US or even lower in other jurisdictions. The strategy here is very simple: Step 1: Maintain a trade record that keeps proper purchase dates and cost basis for each crypto you buy. Step 2: Mark incoming taxable events on your calendar (avoid sales within the 12-month window, IF possible). Step 3: Consider selling the older lots first when you need liquidity, provided LIFO is available in your jurisdiction (see the section on choosing a cost-basis method see below). Step 4: Coordinate larger sales with expected changes in income (e.g., deferring to a year with expected lower income; see the section on timing below). Step 5: Use a crypto tax software to tag purchase lots and produce reports that are ready for audits (see below). Use Tax-Loss Harvesting You’ve probably heard the term “tax-loss harvesting” quite a bit. It simply means selling crypto assets that have fallen below your average purchase price to realize a loss. This loss, then, offsets your taxable gains. Example: You bought BTC at $10,000 and sold it at $20,000, therefore realizing a profit of $10,000. However, you also bought ETH at $4,000, and its price has now dropped to $2,000. You can sell that ETH and realize a $2,000 loss. This loss will then offest your $10,000 profit and your taxable income will amount to $8,000. The critical part here is timing the sales properly – they have to be done before the end of the year. You also need to maintain precise transaction records, which include the dates, cost basis, and sale proceeds. Here is a pro tip if you are in the US: You can repurchase the asset you sold immediately after. In some countries, this is referred to as “wash trading,” and there are rules that restrict any repurchases within 30 days. However, in the US, there is no such rule. This can be very effective in bear markets, and it can compound savings across years if unused losses are carried forward, which is one of our next strategies. Donate Crypto to Charity Charitable donations of cryptocurrencies that have appreciated in value can yield major tax advantages. In some jurisdictions, if you donate to registered charities, this would be treated as a non-taxable event, meaning you wouldn’t have to pay capital-gains tax on the appreciation. What is more, you can oftentimes deduct the fair-market value of the crypto you’ve donated when you file your crypto taxes . For example, if you have bought BTC at $10,000 and it is now $20,000, you can donate the $20K – this will spare you the $10K in appreciation and it would also allow a $20K deduction (there are annual deducion limits, though). Step-by-step strategy to follow: Step 1: Confirm the recipient of your charity is an IRS-recognized public charity. Step 2: Donate cryptocurrency directly from your wallet to the charity’s wallet or use a donor-advised platform. Step 3: Request and obtain a written acknowledgment and a receipt, which clearly shows the date and the fair-market value of your donation. Step 4: If the donation is higher than $5,000, obtain a qualified appraisal and complete IRS Form 8283. Step 5: Record transaction hashes and receipts to support the valuation and the transfer of funds. Step 6: Consult your tax advisor about limits on charitable deductions and if there are potential carryforwards. Hold Crypto in Tax-Advantaged Retirement Accounts Some countries allow users to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies through retirement or pension accounts that offer tax-deferred or tax-exempt growth. For example, in the United States, self-directed IRAs, as well as 401(k)s can hold Bitcoin (and a few other cryptocurrencies) through specialized custodians. This means that gains within these accounts are not taxed until you withdraw them (that’s valid for traditional IRAs) or may never be taxed (that’s valid for Roth IRAs). This means that you will be able to buy, sell, and rebalance your positions without necessarily generating immediate taxable events. Similar frameworks exist in other countries as well. For instance, in the UK, there are specific SIPP arrangements. In any case, you must weigh some of the drawbacks such as considerably higher fees, storage limitations, as well as potential withdrawal penalties. Not all providers are equal when it comes to security or regulatory oversight. If you’re a long-term investor or a high-net-worth individual, this can be a very powerful structure and a completely legal way of compounding your crypto investments while also deferring or avoiding capital-gains taxes entirely. Choose a Favorable Cost-Basis Method This is specific. It’s important to understand that your cost-basis method (read: the way you match sold coins to their purchase price) will have an immediate impact on the size of your reported gains. There are a few common approaches here. The first one is FIFO (first-in, first-out), and specific identification (where you can select which coins you sold exactly). The last one is also known as LIFO . Example: If you bought 1 BTC at $10,000 and 1 BTC $20,000, and then you sell one at $40,000, FIFO would treat the $10,000 coin as sold ($30,000 gain), while LIFO uses the $20,000 coin ($20,000 gain). If you live in a country that allows this, choosing the method that objectively yields a smaller gain can legally lower your tax. In the US, the IRS requires consistency and documentation. In other words, you must be able to prove which coins were sold. This usually happens through exchange records or your wallet transactions. That’s where using a good crypo tax software will definitely help you automate these calculations. Carry Forward Capital Losses If your annual losses exceed your annual gains, you should be able to carry those losses forward to offset any future profits. This is completely legal in most jurisdictions. In the US, for instance, up to $3,000 of net capital losses can be deducted against ordinary income per year, with the remainder carried forward indefinitely. There are similar provisions existing in the United Kingdom and Canada. It happens to anyone – a bad trading year can be depressing, but proper planning and accounting can turn it into future tax savings. That’s why it’s crucial to accurately record all losses, retain the relevant statements from the exchanges, and claim them on your upcoming tax return. Time Crypto Disposals Across Tax Years It goes without saying – proper timing can influence your crypto tax bill. For instance, if you sell your crypto in a year when you expect a lower income bracket or more losses to offset them can significantly reduce the due amount. Example: Imagine that you have a big spike in your income in 2025 due to additional working contracts or whatever it is. You do not forecast these to be repeatable events and you expect 2026 to be slower in terms of income. You can delay larger crypto sales until January to potentially save up thousands in taxes. This tactic is 100% legal, but it requires very careful planning of your cash flow and market timing. That said, you can also realize losses before the end of the year to improve your current-year return. IMPORTANT: Tax year ends on December 31st in the US Tax year ends on April 5th in the UK Classify Mining and Validation Properly If you mine cryptocurrency or validate the security of a network, the tax treatment will heavily depend on whether this activity can be qualified as a business or as a hobby. When it’s a business, you can deduct certain operating expenses. These include electricity, cooling, internet, maintenance bills, hardware, as well as the depreciation of this hardware. These deductions add up very quickly and can offset your taxable income significantly. If you are a validator on a Proof-of-Stake network, you should carefully track the fair value of the staking rewards at the time you receive them, as well as any potential slashing events, which may also be expensed. Optimize Residency If you haven’t understood by now – perhaps the single most important factor that will determine the amount of taxes you will have to pay is your tax residency. There are some jurisdictions (including Singapore, the United Arab Emirates, and Portugal) that offer very favorable or even zero capital-gains tax on personal crypto transactions. There are other jurisdictions that provide relief through bilateral tax treaties, helping you avoid double taxation when you earn crypto income abroad. Regardless of your situation, staying educated and learning more about how taxes work in your country is essential. Maintain Excellent Records This is, without a shred of doubt, the simplest way to legally reduce your tax burden. You have to be both thorough and organized. Keeping accurate records will let you claim every possible deduction, loss, and carryforward that’s available to you. Make sure to keep your transaction histories clean, your receipts for hardware wallets, electricity bills, subscriptions for tracking software, and any potential proof of donations. Most of the tax authorities, including the HMRC and the IRS, will require you to report digital-asset transactions even if you have no tax due to pay. That’s why it’s critical to keep proper documentation, because it can turn potential penalties into deductions, save you money, and prevent any disputes. Use Crypto Tax Software Last, but definitely not least, using a crypto tax software can be a great way to save on your taxes. Many of them have built-in loss-harvesting features, ready-to-file reporting, and a bunch of other features that can help you optimize your taxes. At the same time, these tools will 100% save you both time and effort to accurately prepare your yearly tax declaration.

Failing to report all transactions. Mixing personal and business activity. Misreporting losses and wash sales. Not reporting DeFi and NFT transactions. Using the wrong cost-basis method (or none at all). Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Do you pay taxes on crypto before withdrawal? You pay taxes on crypto whenever they are due, irrespective of whether you have withdrawn or not. If there is a qualified taxable event (e.g. a sale, swap, spend, earned income through staking or airdrops), you have to pay taxes with or without withdrawing the proceeds from your exchange or wallet. Can the IRS see my crypto? Yes. Following changes in 2025 and upcoming changes in 2026, crypto exchanges and wallets have to submit Form 1099-DA, which displays your digital assets and their cost basis. Do I pay taxes on crypto I never sold? If you don’t sell your crypto, you typically won’t owe taxes. However, if you have earned crypto through staking, mining, or airdrops, you owe taxes based on the fair value of the digital assets at the moment you received them. What is the 30-day rule in crypto? Also known as the wash sale rule, the 30-day rule means that you have to wait for 30 days before you can repurchase an asset you have sold at a loss. However, this restriction doesn’t apply to crypto as of yet, and loss harvesting is a viable tax reduction strategy. Conclusion Understanding how to legally reduce or (in some cases) avoid paying crypto taxes can be particularly effective. The important thing to understand is that there are legitimate ways to do it, should you go about it intelligently and create a structured and well-planned strategy.

This rally follows a late spike of 9.7% on Friday, which hit in the final minutes of trading when signs appeared that the standoff was starting to cool. The dispute started when the Dutch government seized control of Nexperia on September 30, citing national security concerns and claiming the company could move technology and operations to China, since Wingtech is the parent company. In response, Beijing blocked exports of certain components made in Nexperia’s Chinese facility, leaving carmakers worried. But then the Chinese Commerce Ministry said on Sunday that it had started allowing shipments of some chips produced at Nexperia’s China facility, while also calling on the European Union to pressure the Dutch government to lift its restrictions on the company. The ministry said the situation must move toward resolution and asked the EU to play a role in reducing tension and keeping supply chains stable, as was reported by Cryptopolitan. Beijing agrees to host Dutch officials for further talks China’s statement said Beijing expects the Dutch side to bring “constructive solutions” and take “concrete actions” so the dispute can be resolved soon. This response came after Dutch Economic Affairs Minister Vincent Karremans said on Thursday that chips made by Nexperia would start reaching customers in Europe and beyond within days. He pointed to the “constructive nature of our talks with the Chinese authorities” and linked the progress to cooperation between China, the United States, and the European Commission. According to Karremans, both China and the U.S. had told the Netherlands that the recent trade agreement they reached would allow the restart of shipments from Nexperia’s Chinese production lines. He said this also aligned with information shared by the European Commission and China’s Commerce Ministry. Automakers put operations on alert amid supply concerns The conflict caused heavy stress across the global auto industry, which depends on these chips. Volkswagen warned that production could face disruptions. Honda cut its yearly profit outlook after stopping output at some of its plants because parts were not available. Stellantis said it set up internal “war rooms” to monitor chip availability and search for other suppliers to avoid shutdowns. Analysts linked this entire situation to worsening political pressure between China and the U.S. Neo Wang, a strategist at Evercore ISI, said the clash over Nexperia was the “direct result” of rising tension and trade controls. In late September, the U.S. expanded its entity list, which blocks trade with firms seen as risks to national security or foreign policy. That expansion targeted subsidiaries owned 50% or more by any company already blacklisted. Nexperia, being owned by Wingtech, was caught under these updated rules. After Beijing and Washington reached a temporary trade truce on October 30, both sides reduced some restrictions. Soon after, China announced it would allow Nexperia’s China unit to restart shipments to international customers. However, analysts noted the situation is still fragile. ASML Holding , the Dutch company that makes the world’s most advanced chipmaking machines, sits in the middle of U.S.-China tensions. Washington has been pushing the Dutch government to restrict ASML’s exports to China, making this dispute even more sensitive. A Barclays note from analysts led by Dan Levy said suppliers had already begun receiving shipments, but warned that low chip inventories could still cause delays. They added the relief looks temporary, since the core conflict between Nexperia’s Dutch headquarters and its China-based operations has not been solved.

Framing DARPA’s Quantum Benchmarking Initiative (QBI) as the turning point, he said, “finally, finally, finally, we have an objective source of truth,” adding that “as of November 6, 2025, DARPA has selected 11 companies to enter the second stage which aims to rigorously verify and validate whether any quantum computing approach can achieve utility scale operation […] by the year 2033.” DARPA Advances 11 Quantum Teams He emphasized that QBI is designed to separate “fact from fiction about quantum computers,” and relayed the program manager’s stark split among experts: “Half of them are convinced that quantum computing is going to be the best thing since sliced bread […] and the other half are convinced that even if you could build a quantum computer , which you definitely won’t be able to do, it’s never going to be more useful than your laptop.” The point of QBI, as the manager put it in the clip Hoskinson played, is to answer two questions: “if I had a really powerful quantum computer, what could I do with it?” and “is there a […] group that has a path to really build that kind of machine in the near term […] in the next 10 years?” The Cardano founder walked through QBI’s staged process. “During the six month Stage A […] you are a quantum computer builder […] you spend six months answering every question they can throw at you […] and at the end of all of it, they say, ‘actually, there’s some merit.’” Stage B, he said, is “a rigorous one-year plan” where “you’ve opened the kimono and they’re taking a look at your quantum computing design.” Stage C is the hardware trial: “work with the government to verify and validate that the utility scale quantum computer concept can be constructed as designed and operated as intended,” meaning “they’re actually going to watch you run it” on “objective problems.” He named the 11 companies that, in his account, survived Stage A and entered Stage B—“Atom Computing in Boulder, Colorado […] IBM, IonQ, Nord Quantique, Photonic, Quantinuum […] Quantum Motion, QA Computing, Silicon Quantum Computing and Xanadu”—and highlighted that “there’s no canonical approach for quantum computing.” He rattled off the five families he’s tracking, each with variations: “a neutral atom approach” that uses “highly focused lasers known as optical tweezers,” “silicon-based approaches” that look like specialized chips, “superconducting approaches,” “trapped ion approaches,” and “light-based approaches” where “quantum information is encoded in the properties [of] photons.” For crypto, he made his position explicit: “I am of the belief that quantum computers will exist in the 2030s and they will be able to run Grover’s and Shor’s algorithm,” which means “the majority of mainstream cryptocurrencies will be vulnerable if they do not implement counter measures by that time.” The Cardano founder warned of the “archiving” problem—“encrypted emails, encrypted payloads that were archived can now be decrypted even if they’re re-encrypted later on with a post-quantum scheme because they have a copy of the classical encrypted payload.” His countermeasure checklist starts with the US standards track: “we do have some government standards that NIST came up with called FIPS 203, 204, 205 and 206.” He described them as “an array of tools either lattice-based or hash-based or other to do encryption [and] signatures.” Cardano Prepares For Quantum Era On Cardano’s privacy and ZK layer, Midnight, he announced a deeper pivot: “we’re going to be announcing a program project to change the heart of Midnight, PlonK and Halo 2 to a new standard called Nightstream that is relying on lattice-based crypto,” describing it as “a moonshot” co-built “with a lot of large companies through a project at the Linux Foundation .” In the interim, he said, “next year as Midnight turns on it’ll turn on with PlonK and Halo 2,” but the design is “already pre-designing it to have a drop in replacement […] [so] the basement of it is going to be post-quantum,” with the goal that “Midnight will be immune to quantum computers well ahead of the 2033 deadline.” He pitched lattices as both defense and performance lever. “Turns out that lattices in particular have capabilities above and beyond what Ethereum is doing in the hash-based space,” he argued, claiming they connect “to what’s going on in the AI space with tensors,” so “you can use GPUs to accelerate the writing of a proof […] and the verification of [a] proof,” without “custom chips like Ethereum is proposing.” In his words, “you just use the AI chips that are in your phone, your laptop, your desktop computer, and your server, and you can get linear scale.” The roadmap for Midnight extends beyond internal upgrades. He positioned it as “a folding engine and a recursion engine unlike any other in the entire private computation space,” asserting that “Midnight can create some of the best and lightest weight state proofs of every system it’s connected to. Cardano, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and so forth.” The strategic aim is to sign “those payloads with post-quantum signatures,” producing “a post-quantum checkpoint for Bitcoin and for other systems,” so “even if [a] quantum computer tries to change the state of things […] you’re going to have a rollback mechanism.” He also flagged areas still on the checklist: “There are many other things you have to do. You have to look at post-quantum VRFs and post-quantum VDFs and you have to look at post-quantum random number generation and a litany of other concerns.” The “most important step,” in his view, is “to lock truth, lock history in a state where quantum computers can’t break it.” The upshot for Cardano, he said, is to move now: “Adapt or get cracked.” At press time, Cardano (ADA) traded at $0.5869.",Cardano|ADA|ADA news|ADA Price|Cardano news|Cardano Price,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|ETH|SOL|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-10 08:00:04

Watcher.Guru reported that the U.S. Senate has reached a deal to end the Government shutdown, citing Politico as the source. The news follows one of the most disruptive shutdowns in recent years, which halted several federal operations, delayed regulatory reviews, and weighed on risk assets. Within hours of the report, XRP climbed 8.1% from the previous day, trading at $2.47 as traders anticipated renewed activity across financial and crypto markets. The prolonged standoff had constrained economic momentum and stalled key government functions , including those of agencies responsible for market oversight. With a resolution now in sight, market participants are positioning for an acceleration in pending decisions that could shape digital asset markets. Shutdown’s Effect on Digital Asset Markets The government shutdown began on October 1 and became the longest in U.S. history. Among the institutions affected was the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, as it slowed or postponed several financial product reviews, including spot XRP ETFs . The uncertainty surrounding the shutdown contributed to volatility across digital assets, as investors moved cautiously amid reduced regulatory visibility, making XRP experience steep pullbacks in October. The resolution of the standoff has renewed optimism that normal operations at the SEC and related agencies can resume, allowing long-awaited product approvals to proceed. XRP’s Position Following the Announcement XRP’s advance to $2.47 reflects renewed investor confidence in the asset’s near-term outlook. The token had declined sharply through October but began recovering in early November as speculation over the approval of spot XRP ETFs spread. Several asset managers, including Bitwise and Franklin Templeton, have pending applications for spot XRP ETFs listed with the SEC, and the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) recently listed nine XRP ETFs . These listings represent operational readiness steps, though formal approval from the SEC remains necessary. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 With the federal government set to reopen, analysts expect the regulatory review process to gain momentum. The prospect of ETF approval could draw institutional demand and increase liquidity in XRP markets. Outlook for the Coming Weeks The resolution of the shutdown offers a turning point for sentiment across the crypto market. Market observers note that a functioning government could restore investor confidence, stabilize treasury yields, and strengthen capital inflows into digital assets. XRP is already reacting favorably, and the combination of ETF anticipation, resumed regulatory clarity, and renewed risk appetite provides conditions favorable for sustained growth.

Key Takeaways: Ethereum gas fees have fallen to 0.067 Gwei, making transactions as cheap as $0.04 after October’s market crash. The Dencun upgrade in 2024 cut fees for layer-2s but also slashed Ethereum’s base-layer revenue by 99%, raising sustainability concerns. Analysts warn that prolonged low fees could weaken validator incentives and pressure Ethereum’s long-term financial security. The decline marks a dramatic cooldown for the world’s second-largest blockchain after a volatile start to the fourth quarter. According to Etherscan , executing a token swap on Ethereum now costs just $0.11, while NFT sales carry an average fee of $0.19. Ethereum Bridge Fees Drop to $0.04 After October’s Spike Bridging assets to other blockchains costs around $0.04, and onchain borrowing roughly $0.09. By contrast, gas prices hit 15.9 Gwei on October 10, when the flash crash erased more than 90% of value from some altcoins within a single day. The relief came quickly. By October 12, gas prices had collapsed to 0.5 Gwei and have remained under 1 Gwei for most of October and November, data shows. While the drop has made Ethereum transactions cheaper than ever, analysts warn that the network’s long-term sustainability could be tested if fees remain this low. During the 2021 bull run, transaction costs on Ethereum’s base layer frequently exceeded $100–$150, driving users toward cheaper alternatives and layer-2 solutions. However, since the Dencun upgrade in March 2024, which optimized gas fees for layer-2 rollups, Ethereum’s fee revenue has collapsed by 99%, according to Token Terminal. While low fees improve user accessibility, they also reduce income for validators, the participants who secure the network and process transactions. Analysts note that without sufficient fee incentives, Ethereum could face both financial and security pressures over time. Research from Binance describes this as a “double-edged sword.” Ethereum’s layer-2 scaling ecosystem, which includes networks like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base, has helped Ethereum scale efficiently but has also cannibalized much of its own base-layer revenue. Markets pushed lower, extending BTC’s 31D correction as macro uncertainty and DeFi contagion drove de-risking. Stablecoin data suggests liquidity stays in crypto, with capital sidelined until signals turn clearer. #Binance Research's Weekly Commentary https://t.co/NkiTzdDlN9 — Binance Research (@BinanceResearch) November 7, 2025 For now, traders may welcome near-free transactions, but if activity and fees don’t recover, Ethereum’s economic model could face renewed scrutiny, especially as rival blockchains continue to court developers and users with lower-cost, high-throughput alternatives. Ethereum MEV Fraud Trial Ends in Mistrial as Jury Fails to Reach Verdict As reported, a US federal judge has declared a mistrial in the landmark case against brothers Anton and James Peraire-Bueno, accused of stealing $25 million through an alleged exploit on the Ethereum blockchain. The case marked the first-ever criminal prosecution involving maximal extractable value (MEV), where traders profit from how transactions are ordered on the network. Prosecutors claimed the pair went beyond standard MEV tactics by manipulating Ethereum’s validator layer to reorder transactions and drain funds, calling it “the first exploit of its kind.” The defense countered that their actions followed Ethereum’s internal rules, arguing the brothers operated within the system’s design rather than hacking it. After three days of deliberation, jurors admitted they were exhausted and divided, prompting Judge Jessica Clarke to end the trial.

At the time of writing, the leading cryptocurrency is trading at around $106,274, indicating a 4.38% increase in the last 24 hours. BTC Price, Source: CoinMarketCap The price rise comes as senators voted 60-40 to pass a deal to end the 40-day shutdown, the most extended shutdown of federal operations in United States history. Market observers also noted a temporal relationship between the advancement of legislation and the rise of Bitcoin. Government Shutdown Reaches Historic Length The federal government entered shutdown mode on October 1 following Congress's failure to pass necessary appropriations bills. The funding package demanded by Democrats was the extension of healthcare subsidies. Republicans blocked these provisions, as well as other spending plans they considered too high. The prolonged shutdown has affected many federal agencies and services. The long period saw hundreds of thousands of government workers furloughed or working without pay. Only critical services were running, and many departments were operating with skeleton crews. In the early stages of the shutdown, Bitcoin has shown incredible growth. The cryptocurrency surged to a record high of $126,080 as investors sought to diversify their portfolios by selling assets amid political uncertainty. However, the rally lost steam as the closure dragged on without resolution. The prolonged shutdown created unusual economic conditions. Traditional markets became more volatile as investors considered the potential ramifications of the government's long-term dysfunction. The first boom of Bitcoin marked a conventional safe-haven response during political instability. ETF Approvals Expected to Accelerate Industry analyst Nate Geraci predicts that the end of the shutdown will result in a surge of approvals for exchange-traded funds. During the closure, the Securities and Exchange Commission has been running at reduced capacity. This drawback prevented the agency from processing a large number of pending applications. The regulatory bottleneck has frustrated fund managers who would like to introduce new investment products. Several ETF filings gained approval through automatic effectiveness provisions built into securities law. These mechanisms allow certain applications to proceed without active SEC review under specific circumstances.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-10 08:17:58

The improvised explosives reportedly injured 96 people, mostly teachers and students, with shrapnel wounds and burns. Police identified the 17-year-old male student as the primary suspect, according to local media reports. Budi Hermanto, the Head of Public Relations for the Jakarta Metropolitan Police, Senior Commissioner, said the perpetrator was also caught in the blast and is nursing head injuries and a concussion as investigations continue. Investigative authorities have recovered a Molotov cocktail, unused improvised explosives, a body vest, a revolver pistol, and airsoft rifles covered in white supremacist symbols. The etchings also include 14 words and names of mosque attackers, such as Brenton Tarrant. Diyah Puspitarini, a Commissioner at the Indonesian Child Protection Commission (KPAI), said her party is organizing evidence collection teams from the institution and the relevant ministry. She explained that the teams would visit the suspect’s family to gather information about his condition at home. The teams will also include psychologists from KPPA and social workers. Apart from questioning the suspect’s family, Puspitarini also disclosed that the KPAI has ordered the Indonesian Forensic Psychology Association (APSIFOR) to run a background check on the alleged perpetrator. Hadi says the president ordered online gaming restrictions Indonesian Gerindra Party politician Mensesneg Prasetyo Hadi said the government has plans to mitigate the negative impacts of online gaming . The State Secretary Minister asserted that restrictions need to be considered because many weapons are now becoming easy to learn (and use). Hadi is particularly concerned that the profound psychological effect leaves children abnormally accustomed to violence. He revealed that President Prabowo Subianto has recommended these restrictions on online games, particularly those involving violence. The Minister emphasized that this was a direct consequence of the explosions that occurred at SMAN 72 Jakarta. “He [the president] mentioned earlier that we must also think about restricting and trying to find a way out regarding the influences from online games.” – Prasetyo Hadi , State Secretary Minister in Indonesia According to Hadi, President Subianto is convinced that some of these online games contain content that is not suitable, which may affect his country’s future generations. The Indonesian Child Protection Commission (KPAI) also went into the field to find the real facts behind the school bombing incident. Sumardi claims suspect was a victim of bullying Ito Sumardi, former Head of the Criminal Investigation Unit of the Indonesian National Police, claims the suspect was retaliating against bullying. Preliminary reports based on students’ testimonies revealed that the suspect frequently experienced bullying. Sumardi also explained that there are theoretically two categories of terrorist actions: Lone Wolf or network terrorism, and the alleged perpetrator appeared to be an independent terrorist. He categorized the teen perpetrator as a lone wolf because the suspect’s sole temporary judgment and actions caused the tragedy. There were no orders from anyone, but the suspect’s own experiences made him carry out the act. According to Sumardi, the suspect planned to detonate several improvised explosives, adding that the perpetrator simply did not care how significant the impact of the explosion would be. He mentioned that police reports confirmed the perpetrator detonated seven explosives. The former senior police officer also claimed that the suspect could have learned how to make explosives through social media . He pointed out that the 17-year-old may have been inspired by terrorists abroad because the world is now deep into the digital age. Sumardi suspects that the young man’s frequent interaction with violent, bloody images and the American flag may have triggered the retaliatory bombing. However, he acknowledged that it is difficult to monitor children who are hurt and seeking revenge.

This temporary halt allows the exchange to safely implement Berachain’s mainnet upgrade without risking user funds or causing transaction errors. Such maintenance periods are common in the crypto space when networks undergo significant improvements. During this Bithumb BERA suspension period, users cannot deposit or withdraw BERA tokens. However, trading pairs involving BERA will remain active unless otherwise announced. The exchange typically resumes services once they confirm network stability after the upgrade completion.

If you hold BERA tokens on Bithumb, here’s what you need to know about this temporary Bithumb BERA suspension: Plan your transactions before November 12 at 9:00 a.m. UTC Deposits initiated during the suspension may be delayed or returned Withdrawal requests won’t process until services resume Monitor official Bithumb announcements for updates This proactive approach by Bithumb demonstrates their commitment to user security during network transitions. The Bithumb BERA suspension, while inconvenient temporarily, ultimately benefits traders through improved network performance and security enhancements. How long will the BERA suspension last? While Bithumb hasn’t specified an exact end time for the Bithumb BERA suspension, similar maintenance windows typically last several hours to a full day. The duration depends on the complexity of the mainnet upgrade and thorough testing requirements afterward. Exchange officials recommend checking their official communication channels for the most current information about the Bithumb BERA suspension timeline. They usually provide regular updates through their website, social media accounts, and email notifications to registered users. What are the benefits of this network upgrade?

Network upgrades typically enhance: Transaction speed – Faster confirmation times Security features – Enhanced protection mechanisms Scalability – Increased network capacity Functionality – New features and capabilities This temporary Bithumb BERA suspension represents necessary growing pains for technological advancement. The short-term inconvenience paves the way for long-term benefits that strengthen the Berachain ecosystem and improve user experience. Final thoughts on the Bithumb announcement The scheduled Bithumb BERA suspension on November 12 demonstrates responsible exchange management during critical network updates. While temporary service interruptions can frustrate users, they’re essential for maintaining secure and efficient trading environments. This planned maintenance reflects Bithumb’s commitment to providing reliable services while supporting blockchain innovation. Frequently Asked Questions Can I still trade BERA during the suspension?

54229432,624564,1762766748,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54229432.jpeg,Best Meme Coins Surge as Trump Floats $2K ‘Dividend’; Maxi Doge Nears $4M Presale,https://bitcoinist.com/trump-2k-dividend-best-meme-coins-maxi-doge-presale/,"Quick Facts: Markets cheered Trump’s $2K ‘tariff dividend’ idea, reviving risk appetite and fueling speculation, despite nothing official yet. Trump’s announcement brought the meme market into the green, with $DOGE recording a 6% boost following the news. Maxi Doge (MAXI) combines meme energy with on-chain staking, contests, and a fixed supply design, aiming to smooth early post-listing flows. $MAXI raised over $3.9M in presale, and it’s still going; investors could secure an ROI of 2,068% in 2026 based on $MAXI’s current presale price. Markets just caught a jolt of liquidity optimism. In a Sunday flurry, President Trump said most Americans would get a ‘tariff dividend’ of at least $2K, and equities and crypto promptly perked up. Analysts frame the move as a spark for risk-on appetite , with traders treating a potential cash transfer like a fresh retail stimulus. That shift matters for the most volatile corners of crypto. It pulls sidelined capital back toward narratives with torque, meme coins included. The tape reacted fast. Dogecoin ticked higher as the token put on 6% in clean muscle following Trump’s announcement. Momentum is still fragile, but policy-linked upside has a way of reviving speculative flow, even before details harden. That’s the key tell for you: in a market hunting for catalysts, perception often front-runs policy. There are caveats. The Wall Street Journal underscored that any $2K payout likely requires Congressional approval and may face legal scrutiny, so this isn’t a guaranteed check in your mailbox. Still, the narrative alone can juice positioning. When liquidity hopes improve, traders rotate down the risk curve, and the ‘best meme coins’ conversation gets louder. This is especially true for presales with clear mechanics and on-chain utility hooks. Enter Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , a gym-bro meme with on-chain staking and contests that’s already closing on a $4M presale tally. The setup fits the moment. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Turns Culture Into On-Chain Staking and Competitions Maxi Doge ($MAXI) isn’t trying to be a payments coin; it’s bottle-rocket culture turned product. The whitepaper puts utility into three buckets: a staking pool with automated distribution, holder-only trading contests with leaderboards, and partner-driven events geared toward perp platforms. The token runs as an ERC-20 on Ethereum, with Uniswap V3 listings indicated post-presale and CEX talks flagged as ongoing. For traders watching risk rotations, that’s the right mix: fun first, then repeatable engagement loops. Security boxes? The project’s site displays audits by SolidProof and Coinsult and routes purchases through a third-party widget, which recommends the project as safe for investors. Token economics are straightforward: a fixed 150.24B supply with large slices earmarked for marketing and a ‘Maxi Fund’ to push listings and growth, plus a capped staking allocation that funds the reward pool for up to a year. High APYs often hint at bootstrapping, not durable yield; the structure here at least tells you where rewards come from and for how long. Read the docs and size positions accordingly. Maxi Doge — $3.9M Raised, 78% Staking Live, Unlimited Meme Potential Maxi Doge successfully raised over $3.96M with the token priced at $0.0002675, positioning $MAXI as one of the best meme coins of 2025. If ‘tariff dividends’ add even a sliver of fresh retail funds, that’s the kind of liquidity impulse that tends to spill into active presales first. The project brings a heavy dose of unhinged meme value, advertising for 1000x leverage, no safety nets, and a Red Bull-fueled trading rampage that could help you retire by 22. $MAXI is everything Dogecoin intended to be: the official mascot of terminally online degen traders who share the same goal – get rich or keep trading until it happens. The result is expected: an ecosystem with unlimited meme potential, fueled by community hype. Based on this, our price prediction for $MAXI puts the token at $0.0058 in 2026, which translates to an ROI of 2,068% if you invest at today’s price. If we’re going by raw numbers, we could position Maxi Doge ($MAXI) among the best crypto presales of 2025, and this is without counting Maxi’s meme energy and its ability to rally the community. This is not financial advice. Do your own research before investing.

During an interview with the Financial Times, Ledger CEO Pascal Gauthier said the move is being considered mainly as the company pushes through its best year yet, with revenues climbing and institutional interest picking up. Founded in 2014, Ledger offers physical security devices and software integrations that allow individuals and institutions to safely store their digital assets offline. Although hardware wallets or other cold storage solutions are not completely foolproof, they significantly reduce the risk of remote hacks by making it much harder for attackers to access private keys. According to Gauthier, the key driver behind the company’s sales growth has been the sharp surge in hacks and targeted attacks that aim to solicit funds directly from crypto users. Separate data provided by blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis shows that over $2.2 billion had been stolen from the crypto market in just the first half of 2025. Much of this activity has been directed at retail users who are less likely to rely on secure custody solutions. “We’re being hacked more and more every day . . . hacking of your bank accounts, of your crypto, and it’s not going to get better next year and the year after that,” Gauthier added. By 2023, Ledger was valued at $1.5 billion after it closed a funding round backed by investors including 10T Holdings and True Global Ventures. According to Gauthier, the company may also pursue a fresh private capital raise next year in case it decides not to go public right away. The company is currently on a hiring spree in New York as it looks to strengthen its presence in the city. “Me spending more time in New York is with the understanding that money is in New York today for crypto; it’s nowhere else in the world, it’s certainly not in Europe,” Gauthier said. High-profile crypto IPOs hit Wall Street 2025 can be considered a breakout year for crypto listings, as it has been marked by a steady stream of major players tapping public markets for growth. Since the start of the year, several crypto-native firms have grabbed headlines with their stock market debuts. Some of the key launches include Circle , which raised over $1 billion in its June IPO, and Bullish, which joined the public markets after an extended buildup that began in late 2024. However, some crypto native firms like Ripple and Tether have taken a different route and have downplayed or deferred IPO plans for now. As previously reported by Invezz, Ripple president Monica Long said the company has no timeline for a listing and sees little value in going public at this stage, especially as it remains well capitalised and able to fund its expansion plans independently.

A summary of the central bank’s meeting noted that “conditions for taking a further step toward the normalization of the policy interest rate have almost been met.” This suggestion aligns with the predictions of most markets. During the meeting, one of nine board members outlined the likelihood of initiating another step towards normalizing the policy interest rate. The member made this statement while emphasizing the importance of paying attention to the factors driving inflation. These remarks were part of a summary published on Monday. During their two-day meeting that concluded on October 30, the board voted 7-2 to keep the rates unchanged. The nine-member board favors increasing interest rates The summary released this week indicates that the nine-member board is leaning toward the idea that a rate hike is approaching. This idea aligns with the recent suggestion by the Governor of the Bank of Japan, Kazuo Ueda, who has proposed a potential move in the upcoming months. Following this news, almost all analysts tracking BOJ anticipate that borrowing costs will increase by January. With this prediction in mind, people’s attention is now on whether this forecast will occur on December 19 or January. Following the release of the summary, reports indicate that the yen traded at approximately 153.80 against the dollar. This was after attaining an eight-month low record of 154.48 last week. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that the BOJ maintained its policy rate at 0.5% during the October meeting. The decision was made, although two dissenting votes called for an increase for the second time. A survey conducted by a reliable source last month found that approximately half of those monitoring the BOJ believe the central bank will raise borrowing costs in December. On the other hand, almost 98% of these individuals predict that the increase in borrowing costs will take place by January at the latest. Ueda points out the impacts of expectations for wage changes on interest rates Regarding the BOJ’s decision to maintain the interest rates steady in October, Ueda asserted that a rate hike could occur as soon as next month. However, he mentioned that this move will take place depending on expectations for wage changes in 2026. Nevertheless, the yen weakened as investors were selling, hoping for a strong statement from the Governor. This followed recent comments from US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who said the central bank needs to act faster on rate hikes. In the meantime, as many forecasted, the bank held its short-term policy rate at 0.5%. Not all board members agreed on this decision. An example of these board members includes Hajime Takata and Naoki Tamura, who expressed their disagreement, citing their September proposal to raise the rates to 0.75%. Ueda added that the growing perception in the market is that the conditions for a rate hike are falling into place. He said the possibility that the BOJ will achieve its basic forecast has “strengthened somewhat.” The Governor further explained that the BOJ hopes to wait for “a bit more data” to gauge whether companies will still lift wages in the face of rising US tariffs. “I’m not saying we should wait until we have the final results of next year’s wage talks,” Ueda said when reporters asked him if he believes there will be enough data to consider a rate increase at December’s meeting. Based on his argument, the bank wants to gather more information on how these talks start.

Strategy added 397 $BTC last week, reinforcing the corporate DCA bid beneath Bitcoin’s price action. Bitcoin Hyper maps a canonical bridge + SVM design to bring speed to $BTC while anchoring settlement on L1 for added security. The presale has raised around $26.4M with 44% staking yields, and the price is at $0.013245. It will increase in the next seven hours. A closely watched bear bet just blinked. Renowned short seller James Chanos has closed his 11-month $MSTR/$BTC hedge, signaling a shift in the trade that’s defined the downcycle for Bitcoin-exposed equities. Bears don’t give up easily, but when they do, they often have an outsized impact on the market. That shift matters for traders who’ve been waiting for a cleaner macro tape to let crypto beta breathe. Plus, momentum in Bitcoin treasuries adds weight to the narrative. Michael Saylor’s Strategy added another 397 $BTC last week, lifting its stack to 641,205 $BTC while continuing to tap capital markets. Corporates using dollar-cost averaging at six figures per coin is the opposite of capitulation; it’s an institutional bullish case. If the short-side thesis is disappearing while balance-sheet buyers keep buying, the bear narrative might become a thing of the past soon. Chanos’ exit also came as the premium between Strategy’s equity and its underlying $BTC narrowed hard, and that’s one reason the hedge made less sense to maintain. For traders watching risk rotations, that’s the setup where liquidity fans out to higher-beta names and fresh narratives. In that environment, projects that aim to upscale Bitcoin’s speed and programmability, like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), tend to stand out. 📚 Learn more about Bitcoin Hyper in our comprehensive review. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – $BTC Security, SVM-Speed, L2 Upscaling Bitcoin Hyper’s thesis is straightforward: keep Bitcoin as the settlement bedrock while shifting throughput to an SVM execution layer that feels near-instant. $BTC’s real-time transaction speed averages just seven TPS, far from the likes of Solana’s ~700 TPS. So, $BTC’s chain is extremely slow, so much so that it’s almost unusable for most modern DeFi demands. Bitcoin Hyper wants to change that. Its architecture features a Canonical Bridge that takes your $BTC and mints wrapped $BTC on a Layer-2 that processes fast transactions, then batches updates back to Layer-1 with zero-knowledge commitments. In plain English: you get Bitcoin’s credibility with modern performance, opening the door to payments, DeFi, and dApps without leaving the $BTC orbit. The full ecosystem involves easy deposits, fast-lane execution, periodic settlement, withdrawal, plus a token model where $HYPER powers gas, staking, and governance. $HYPER’s tokenomics reads like a typical bootstrapping plan (development, rewards, listings, marketing, and treasury) aimed at scaling slowly and methodically. That’s an important context if you’re tracking sustainability. But the utility pitch is the real tell: if the Layer-2 actually makes $BTC feel instant and cheap, usage can start to outrun emissions. Over $26.4M Raised in Viral Presale: Best Altcoin to Buy? $HYPER’s presale momentum supports the narrative. The total raise has hit $26.4M, fueled by several whale purchases in recent months (including $379K last month). This is a healthy signal that retail is still willing to fund execution bets tied to Bitcoin if the story is coherent and proves useful. With a token price of $0.013245 and a staking APY of 44%, investing in $HYPER now is a smart move if you want to get in early. And our $HYPER price prediction estimates a potential $0.08625 price point by the end of 2026 – that’s a 551% increase from today’s price. 📚 Take a look at our step-by-step guide to buying $HYPER. ‘Pay for utility, not fantasy’ is the tone, which is exactly the kind of framing that lands when the bear fog lifts and the focus shifts back to risk-on moves. For now, the signals rhyme: a veteran shorter closes shop, corporate balance sheets keep stacking Bitcoin, and $BTC’s infrastructure story moves from forum posts to credible rollup design. If the bear market is indeed fading, leadership often starts at the top (Bitcoin) and then rotates to the best altcoins out there (Bitcoin Hyper). A $BTC-anchored Layer-2 with a clear technical map and growing presale demand fits that playbook perfectly. 🚀 Get your $HYPER now before the next price increase.

This U.S. dollar decline represents a major shift in market sentiment as political uncertainty begins to clear. Why the U.S. Dollar Decline Matters Now Currency traders are repositioning their portfolios as the government shutdown resolution appears imminent. The dollar index has dropped nearly 1.5% this week alone, reflecting changing expectations about Federal Reserve policy and economic stability. This movement creates opportunities and risks across all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Government Shutdown Resolution Timeline and Impact The approaching government shutdown resolution has triggered several immediate market reactions: Reduced safe-haven demand for the U.S. dollar Increased risk appetite among institutional investors Rebound in government-sensitive sectors Normalization of Treasury market operations Currency Pair Weekly Change Key Driver EUR/USD +1.8% Shutdown resolution optimism USD/JPY -1.2% Reduced safe-haven flows GBP/USD +1.5% Dollar weakness momentum Currency Markets React to Political Developments Currency markets are showing clear patterns as the shutdown end approaches. The dollar’s weakness is most pronounced against risk-sensitive currencies, while traditional safe-havens like the Japanese yen and Swiss franc are also losing ground against most majors. This suggests a broad-based reduction in risk aversion among forex traders. Federal Reserve Policy Implications The Federal Reserve policy outlook is crucial in understanding the dollar’s movement. With the shutdown resolution reducing economic uncertainty, the Fed may feel more comfortable maintaining its current tightening path. However, the economic damage from the prolonged shutdown could still influence future rate decisions. Global Economic Impact Beyond Borders The global economic impact of the dollar’s decline extends far beyond U.S. markets. Emerging market currencies are breathing a sigh of relief as dollar pressure eases, while European and Asian exporters face new competitive challenges. This interconnectedness demonstrates why currency movements matter for all investors. What Does This Mean for Your Portfolio? Strategic considerations for navigating this market shift: Diversify currency exposure beyond the U.S. dollar Monitor Federal Reserve communications closely Consider hedging strategies for international investments Watch for correlation changes between traditional and digital assets FAQs: Understanding the Market Shift How long will the dollar weakness last? Market consensus suggests the dollar could remain under pressure for several weeks as economic data normalizes post-shutdown. Which central banks are most affected? The Federal Reserve faces complex decisions, while the European Central Bank may adjust its policy timeline. Are cryptocurrencies correlated with this dollar move? Historical patterns show Bitcoin often moves inversely to dollar strength, making this development crucial for crypto investors. What about Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s role? Treasury Secretary Yellen has been actively monitoring market stability throughout the shutdown period. How does this affect the International Monetary Fund? The International Monetary Fund has previously warned about U.S. political instability affecting global financial markets. The resolution of the government shutdown marks a critical turning point for currency markets and broader financial stability. While the immediate U.S. dollar decline reflects relief among investors, the longer-term implications for Federal Reserve policy and global economic coordination remain uncertain. Smart investors should view this as an opportunity to reassess their exposure to dollar-denominated assets and consider broader diversification strategies.

The currency’s sensitivity to economic data releases creates sharp price movements. Understanding pound volatility patterns helps in developing effective trading strategies. Assessing the broader currency outlook The overall currency outlook for GBP remains cautious. Multiple factors influence the pound’s trajectory, creating complex trading dynamics. This currency outlook requires careful analysis of both domestic and international developments. FAQs: Understanding GBP Market Dynamics How does Bank of England policy affect GBP? The Bank of England influences GBP through interest rate decisions and monetary policy guidance. Governor Andrew Bailey and the Monetary Policy Committee determine rate settings that directly impact currency valuation. What economic indicators most impact GBP? Key indicators include inflation data from the Office for National Statistics , employment figures, GDP growth, and retail sales. These metrics help traders anticipate Bank of England policy changes. How do global events affect pound volatility? International factors including Federal Reserve policy, European Central Bank decisions, and geopolitical developments significantly influence pound volatility through risk sentiment and interest rate differentials. In conclusion, the British pound stands at a critical juncture where UK jobs data and BoE rate cut expectations create substantial market uncertainty.

The jump marks the third sharp move in under 48 hours, pushed by renewed speculation over U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposed $2,000 “tariff dividends” and fresh on-chain data showing an uptick in short-term volatility. Rising Volatility Reflects Liquidity Testing Phase Binance data analyzed by Arab Chain shows that Bitcoin’s 7-day realized volatility (RV-7d) has risen to 0.410, well above the 30-day measure of 0.360. This divergence, where short-term volatility outpaces longer-term averages, suggests that the market is entering a liquidity-testing phase, where quick repositioning by traders temporarily unsettles prices without altering the broader trend. According to Arab Chain, this setup often appears when short-term traders dominate momentum, driving sudden intraday swings, while medium- and long-term investors hold steady, waiting for directional confirmation. In practice, it means that Bitcoin’s recent jumps and dips are being shaped by speculative moves in derivatives and leveraged positions rather than by deep structural shifts in demand. The data from Binance also indicates that this phase usually comes before major market moves. If the RV-7d continues to rise while the RV-30d remains unchanged, the market could soon face price pressure, with BTC either pushing through upper resistance levels or being pulled back toward new demand zones. The Arab Chain analysis noted that such short-term bursts in volatility often emerge when traders become more sensitive to headlines or economic signals, which can lead to exaggerated reactions in both directions. In this case, those signals included the recent political and economic developments in the U.S., where President Trump proposed a $2,000 per-person tariff dividend, reigniting talk of a potential liquidity influx similar to that of the 2020 stimulus era. XWIN Research Japan says that today’s market is much better prepared to handle this extra money than it was in 2020, thanks to the growth of spot ETFs, more involvement from big investors, and easy access to crypto through brokerage apps. Policy Hints and Trader Behavior Shape the Market Outlook Trump’s comments sparked BTC’s latest rally, with analysts estimating that his plan could inject around $600 billion into the U.S. economy. At the time of writing, the asset was trading above $106,000, having gained more than 4% in the last 24 hours. However, it remains down roughly 1% for the week and over 8% for the past fortnight, showing the ongoing pressure following its all-time high in early October. As noted by Arab Chain, if the RV-7d continues to rise without a corresponding rise in the RV-30d, Bitcoin may soon encounter another turning point. Whether that leads to a decisive breakout above $108,000 or a retreat toward $100,000 will depend on how much liquidity the next wave of speculative and institutional capital brings into play.

As cryptocurrency investors navigate uncertain markets, understanding key Bitcoin factors becomes crucial for making informed decisions. This week presents several significant developments that could shape Bitcoin’s trajectory in the coming days. What Are the Most Important Bitcoin Factors Right Now? Several critical Bitcoin factors are converging this week, creating a potentially volatile environment for the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Market participants should pay close attention to these four key elements that could significantly impact Bitcoin’s price direction and overall market sentiment. Government Shutdown Resolution and Bitcoin’s Recovery Bitcoin has shown remarkable resilience, climbing back to $106,000 as expectations grow for an end to the U.S. government shutdown. This recovery represents one of the most positive Bitcoin factors currently influencing market psychology. When government operations stabilize, it typically boosts investor confidence across all financial markets, including cryptocurrencies. However, traders should remain cautious. The resolution might already be priced in, meaning any disappointment could trigger sudden reversals. Monitoring this political development remains essential for understanding short-term Bitcoin price movements. Inflation Data: The Volatility Trigger Major U.S. inflation indicators represent critical Bitcoin factors this week. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) releases often create significant market movements. Here’s why these matter for Bitcoin: CPI measures consumer inflation – affects Federal Reserve policy decisions PPI tracks wholesale prices – indicates future consumer inflation trends Higher inflation data could signal tighter monetary policy Lower than expected numbers might support risk assets like Bitcoin These inflation-related Bitcoin factors typically cause increased trading volume and price swings across cryptocurrency markets. Derivatives Market Fear: What Traders Are Betting The derivatives market reveals another layer of important Bitcoin factors. Currently, there’s persistent fear among traders, with limited betting interest on rallies beyond $120,000. This sentiment indicator provides valuable insights into market expectations. Key observations from derivatives data include: Low open interest for call options above $120,000 Put-call ratios suggesting caution Funding rates remaining relatively neutral Leverage levels showing restrained positioning These Bitcoin factors from derivatives markets suggest professional traders remain cautious about near-term upside potential. Whale Activity and Long-Term Holder Behavior Large-scale investor movements constitute crucial Bitcoin factors that often precede significant price changes. Currently, we’re observing continued selling pressure from whales while monitoring whether long-term investor holdings will recover. Important whale-related Bitcoin factors to watch include: Exchange inflows from large wallets Distribution patterns among major holders Long-term holder supply changes Accumulation behavior during price dips These Bitcoin factors involving major investors provide clues about market structure and potential support/resistance levels. How Should Traders Approach These Bitcoin Factors? Navigating these multiple Bitcoin factors requires a balanced approach. Rather than reacting to any single development, consider how these elements interact. The government shutdown resolution might provide temporary relief, while inflation data could dictate medium-term trends. Meanwhile, derivatives positioning and whale activity offer context about market participant expectations. Successful traders will monitor all these Bitcoin factors collectively rather than in isolation. Conclusion: Navigating Multiple Market Forces Understanding these critical Bitcoin factors provides a framework for navigating this week’s potential volatility. The convergence of political developments, economic data, derivatives sentiment, and large investor behavior creates a complex landscape. However, by monitoring these key Bitcoin factors systematically, investors can make more informed decisions and potentially identify emerging opportunities in cryptocurrency markets. Frequently Asked Questions What are the most important Bitcoin factors affecting price this week? The four key Bitcoin factors include the U.S. government shutdown resolution, inflation data releases, derivatives market sentiment, and whale selling pressure combined with long-term holder behavior. How does inflation data impact Bitcoin prices? Inflation data influences Federal Reserve policy expectations, which affects all risk assets including Bitcoin. Higher inflation typically signals potential interest rate hikes, which can pressure Bitcoin prices. Why are whale movements important Bitcoin factors? Whale movements indicate sentiment among large investors and can signal potential support or resistance levels. Their trading activity often precedes significant price movements. What does derivatives market data reveal about Bitcoin factors? Derivatives data shows professional trader positioning and sentiment. Low betting interest above $120,000 suggests limited expectation for near-term rallies beyond that level. How quickly do these Bitcoin factors impact prices? Some Bitcoin factors like inflation data cause immediate reactions, while others like whale accumulation may have more gradual effects over days or weeks. Can retail traders use these Bitcoin factors effectively? Yes, monitoring these Bitcoin factors helps all investors understand market context, though professional traders often have more sophisticated tools for interpretation.

Key Takeaways: Crypto investment products saw $1.17 billion in outflows, marking a second straight week of institutional withdrawals. Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs led the redemptions, with $1.22 billion and $508 million in outflows respectively. Despite heavy institutional selling, Bitcoin briefly rose 4.4% above $106,000. According to the latest fund flow data , trading volumes in exchange-traded products (ETPs) stayed high at $43 billion, though investor sentiment remained fragile following the October 10 liquidity cascade. A brief midweek rebound on optimism over a potential resolution to the U.S. government shutdown quickly faded, triggering another round of withdrawals by Friday. US Leads $1.22B Crypto Fund Outflows as Bitcoin, Ethereum Face Heavy Selling The US market accounted for the majority of the losses, with $1.22 billion in outflows, while Germany and Switzerland bucked the trend, recording inflows of $41.3 million and $49.7 million, respectively. Bitcoin remained the focal point of redemptions, suffering $932 million in outflows last week. In contrast, short Bitcoin ETPs saw inflows of $11.8 million, marking their strongest week since May 2025. Ethereum also saw heavy selling, with outflows reaching $438 million. Despite the bearish trend, select altcoins showed resilience. Solana led with $118 million in inflows, bringing its nine-week total to $2.1 billion. Other gainers included HBAR with $26.8 million and Hyperliquid with $4.2 million, underscoring investor interest in emerging blockchain ecosystems even as broader market sentiment remains cautious. As reported, US spot Bitcoin ETFs saw massive redemptions last week , with $1.22 billion in net outflows, marking the third-largest weekly withdrawal on record, according to SoSoValue. Friday alone accounted for $558.4 million in outflows, the biggest single-day loss since August, while Ethereum ETFs lost $508 million. From November 3 to November 7 (ET), spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a weekly net outflow of $1.22 billion, the third-largest on record. Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded a weekly net outflow of $508 million, also the third-largest in history. Spot Solana ETFs posted a weekly net inflow of $137… pic.twitter.com/6QHfqFTsRb — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) November 10, 2025 The largest redemptions were led by BlackRock’s IBIT, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC and Grayscale’s GBTC funds. Despite the institutional outflows, Bitcoin’s price climbed 4.4%, briefly surpassing $106,000, suggesting retail activity and spot demand remain resilient even as large players trim exposure. Factors such as inflation fears, central bank rate hikes, and geopolitical risks have driven risk aversion across markets. Bitcoin Rebounds Above $106K as Shutdown Optimism Lifts Risk Sentiment: QCP Optimism over a potential US government shutdown resolution boosted risk sentiment across global markets, with Bitcoin rebounding to $106,000 after several dips below $100,000, according to a new report by QCP Capital . The firm noted that despite ongoing spot ETF outflows and selling from long-term holders (“OGs”), crypto joined equities in a broad relief rally. Risk reversals also showed fading demand for downside protection, signaling reduced fear of another major liquidation. The report compared the current wave of OG selling to past events like Silk Road and Mt. Gox distributions, noting that deeper market liquidity has allowed these supply shocks to be absorbed without breaking structural momentum. The firm said Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs) remain a key sentiment driver but have shown limited activity amid tight trading ranges. While Bitcoin’s strong rejection of the $100K level offers some technical support, QCP expects continued range-bound trading in the medium term. Any push above $118K could meet renewed selling from OG wallets unless macro tailwinds and ETF inflows strengthen meaningfully.

He stated that decentralized technologies can help expand freedom of opportunity. According to Armstrong, the world needs more capitalists than socialists to achieve prosperity, even for the poorest members of society. Armstrong made the remarks while responding to chart data comparing the gross domestic product per capita between Poland and Venezuela from 1931 to 2022. The chart shows Poland rising sharply in recent decades versus Venezuela’s collapse, noting that Capitalism created Poland’s growth while socialism killed Venezuela. Coinbase CEO says we need more capitalism and less socialism According to Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase , if we want prosperity, especially for the poorest people in society, we need more capitalism and less socialism. He acknowledged that crypto enables capitalism by injecting economic freedom into every country around the world. Source: Madisson project database; GDP per capita for Poland vs Venezuela since 1931-2022. Based on the Coinbase CEO’s remarks, cryptocurrencies can improve financial inclusion and reduce dependence on centralized systems. He noted that blockchain-based solutions can help individuals in countries that face inflation and restricted access to banking services. Debates surrounding the preservation of liberty and economic independence have intensified as governments expand regulations and fiscal control worldwide. Armstrong responded to a previous post about political and financial freedom. The post was shared by Kyle Bass, Chief Investment Officer of Hayman Capital Management, featuring comments from Venezuelan opposition leader laureate Maria Corina Machado. Machado warned about the consequences of socialism, citing Venezuela as an example. Armstrong responded to the post, noting that this is the reason why Coinbase fights for economic freedom and why the world needs cryptocurrencies. He added that crypto guarantees freedom. “Twenty-six years ago, Venezuelan youth fell in love with a socialist in Hugo Chávez. When people pointed to Cuba as a warning, they said, Venezuela is not Cuba. And Cuba is not real socialism. But here we are worse than Cuba.” -Nobel Laureate Maria Corina Machado , Venezuelan opposition leader Armstrong says socialism elevates the state above the citizen According to the Coinbase CEO, socialism always follows the same pattern, as it elevates the state above the citizen, strips away human autonomy, conscience, dignity, and the ability to choose. He reiterated the view, shared by other crypto proponents, that digital assets represent a safeguard against governments’ overreach. Armstrong trusts that decentralized systems preserve personal control and promote open access to financial tools across borders. He supports the view that protecting self-sovereignty through cryptocurrency is essential in an era when central authorities have increased their influence on markets and the economy. Based on a Cryptopolitan report , Armstrong has also advocated for crypto adoption to everyone, debunking the myth that crypto is only for the wealthy. He noted that anyone can buy and hold cryptocurrency with a small amount tied to their account. He encouraged small business owners and everyday people to start with small amounts to join and grow in the growing digital economy, noting that it’s never too late. Armstrong’s post revealed that many people will use crypto in the next ten years, and some will do so unknowingly. He noted that many people around the world have no access to banking, and crypto will provide them with a way to manage their money using just a phone and the internet. He acknowledged that decentralized finance will allow anyone to borrow, lend, save, and trade money safely with very low fees. Armstrong believes that BTC could reach $1 million by 2030 as demand from institutional investors and ETFs grows. He further reiterated that the real value of crypto lies in giving individuals more control over their own finances and enabling anyone to participate in the financial system.

According to Maeil Business Newspaper reports, these discussions have progressed to management-level meetings, indicating serious intent from both parties. This strategic move follows Bybit’s pattern of global expansion and could provide the exchange with immediate access to South Korea’s sophisticated crypto market. Industry experts view this potential deal as a logical progression for both companies. Bybit gains established infrastructure and regulatory compliance in South Korea, while Korbit benefits from Bybit’s global reach and technological resources. The timing appears strategic, coinciding with growing institutional interest in Asian crypto markets. What Benefits Could This Acquisition Bring? This potential Bybit acquisition offers numerous advantages for both exchanges and their users: Enhanced liquidity across both platforms Improved trading pairs and market access Shared technology and security features Regulatory compliance in multiple jurisdictions Better user experience through combined resources The integration could create one of the most comprehensive trading ecosystems in Asia. Moreover, South Korean traders would gain access to Bybit’s global network, while international users could more easily enter the South Korean market. How Will This Impact South Korea’s Crypto Market? South Korea represents one of the world’s most active cryptocurrency markets. The potential Bybit acquisition of Korbit could significantly influence market dynamics in several ways. First, it may accelerate regulatory developments as authorities respond to increased international presence. Second, competition among local exchanges could intensify, potentially leading to improved services and lower fees for traders. This move also signals growing confidence in South Korea’s crypto regulatory framework. Bybit’s interest suggests that international exchanges see long-term potential in the Korean market despite its unique regulatory requirements and trading practices. What Challenges Might This Acquisition Face? While the potential Bybit acquisition appears promising, several challenges remain. Regulatory approval represents the most significant hurdle, as South Korean authorities carefully scrutinize foreign ownership of financial services companies. Additionally, cultural and operational integration between the two exchanges requires careful management to ensure smooth transition for users. The companies must also address: Data protection and privacy compliance User account migration processes Technology platform integration Staff retention and organizational alignment What Does This Mean for Crypto Traders? For active cryptocurrency traders, this potential Bybit acquisition could bring exciting developments. The combined platform might offer: Access to previously unavailable trading pairs Enhanced liquidity for Korean won trading Improved arbitrage opportunities Advanced trading tools and features Current users of both platforms should monitor official communications regarding any changes to terms of service, fee structures, or available features. However, industry observers generally expect the transition to be gradual and user-friendly if the deal proceeds. Conclusion: A Transformative Moment in Crypto Exchange Evolution The potential Bybit acquisition of Korbit represents more than just another corporate transaction—it signals the maturation of global cryptocurrency markets. As exchanges consolidate and expand across borders, users benefit from increased choice, improved services, and enhanced security. This strategic move demonstrates how the crypto industry continues to evolve toward greater professionalism and global integration. While Bybit maintains its official “no comment” position, industry sources indicate the talks are progressing positively. The outcome of these discussions could set important precedents for future cross-border exchange acquisitions and partnerships. Frequently Asked Questions What is the current status of the Bybit-Korbit acquisition? According to industry reports, Bybit has initiated acquisition talks with Korbit’s management. However, both companies have not made official statements, and the discussions remain in early stages. How will this acquisition affect existing Korbit users? If the acquisition proceeds, Korbit users will likely experience a gradual transition to Bybit’s platform with improved features and global market access. Account migrations typically prioritize user convenience and data security. Why is Bybit interested in acquiring a South Korean exchange? South Korea represents a significant cryptocurrency market with sophisticated traders. Acquiring Korbit provides Bybit with immediate market entry, established regulatory compliance, and local expertise. What regulatory approvals are needed for this acquisition? The acquisition would require approval from South Korea’s Financial Services Commission and other relevant authorities, who carefully review foreign ownership of financial service providers. When can we expect an official announcement? There’s no confirmed timeline for an official announcement. Acquisition talks of this scale typically take several months before reaching definitive agreements. Will trading fees change after the acquisition? While fee structures may eventually align across platforms, most acquisitions maintain existing fee schedules initially to ensure smooth user transition. Found this analysis helpful?

Interview with Bybit’s B2B Chief,https://cryptopotato.com/what-will-define-institutional-adoption-in-2025-interview-with-bybits-b2b-chief/,"As institutional interest in cryptocurrencies booms, the market is clearly entering a more mature phase – one that’s defined less by speculation and increasingly by integration. Following a period of caution after high-profile market failures (FTX, Celsius, Luna, etc.), traditional players such as hedge funds, banks, and asset managers, have seemingly re-evaluated their approach when it comes to crypto exposure. In this interview, Yoyee Wang, the head of Bybit’s Business-to-business Unit (BBU), talks about how institutional participation is evolving, the renewed emphasis on trust and transparency, as well as the emergin collaboration between traditional finance and the digital asset sector. Dive in to find what will shape further institutional involvement as 2025’s end draws near. Over the past year, institutional participation in crypto has evolved alongside shifting macroeconomic conditions and regulatory clarity in key markets. How are you seeing institutional appetite and strategies change in this new phase of the digital asset market? We are definitely seeing growing institutional appetite from two main avenues. First, there are new entrants — including trading firms, hedge funds, asset managers, and wealth management companies — looking to expand their offerings as their clients show increasing interest in crypto investments. What’s even more interesting is the second group: institutions from the previous adoption wave that had pulled back after the FTX collapse. Many of them are now returning to the market or significantly increasing their exposure to crypto. Trust and transparency remain critical for institutional adoption. How is Bybit’s B2B unit addressing these priorities — especially in areas like custody, liquidity management, and compliance infrastructure? That is a very good question. Custody is actually one of the main business focuses of Bybit’s B2B unit. We have built deep integrations across a full span of custodial partners to meet our clients’ diverse preferences — from crypto-native custodians such as Copper and Fireblocks, to bank-backed solutions like UBS, Qatar National Bank, and Sygnum Bank. We also work with hybrid providers like Zodia, which combine bank-grade security with the flexibility of crypto custody. When it comes to liquidity management, we are bringing the best practices from TradFi to our clients — including features like cross-margining, leverage, and near real-time settlement. This ensures that our clients not only enjoy optimal access to Bybit’s trading liquidity, but also seamless access to their assets’ liquidity — regardless of where they are held or in what forms – crypto, fiat, or even T-bills. And on compliance, Bybit is fully committed to meeting and exceeding regulatory standards across jurisdictions. We hold licenses and registrations in multiple key markets, reflecting our proactive approach to compliance and governance. These include approvals from the Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA) in the UAE, the MiCAR from Austria’s FMA, and full registrations with FIU in India, among others. We also implement robust AML and KYC frameworks, maintain transparent reporting, and work closely with regulators and institutional partners to ensure our infrastructure remains secure, compliant, and future-ready — providing institutions with the trust and assurance they expect from a top-tier global platform. You’ve had an extensive background in traditional banking and asset management before joining Bybit. From your vantage point, what are the most promising avenues for collaboration between traditional finance and digital asset markets today? I believe that any form of collaboration must create value for all parties involved. If we take a step back and ask, “What are the demands, needs, or challenges that traditional finance can solve for digital assets — and vice versa, what can digital asset markets solve for traditional finance?” then the potential avenues for collaboration become much clearer. Tokenization is widely seen as the next frontier for blockchain adoption. What role do you see Bybit playing in facilitating or supporting RWA tokenization, and what are the key barriers that still need to be addressed for institutional scale? We have already offered a comprehensive suite of solutions designed to help RWA projects launch, scale, and integrate — enabling them to expand use cases, build AUM, and enhance profitability. The key barriers are similar to those facing broader crypto adoption. In some regions, regulatory clarity remains vague, which makes large-scale institutional participation difficult. In addition, the liquidity and standardization of the underlying assets behind RWAs are still evolving, and these factors can constrain project growth potential and slow institutional adoption. Bybit has positioned itself as a reliable partner for B2B and institutional clients. Could you share more about how Bybit is evolving its infrastructure — from APIs and liquidity solutions to risk management systems — to meet enterprise-level demands? Our principle is simple and straight-forward: we try our best to bring the most advanced trading features, tools and infrastructure to our clients whenever we can. For Bybit institutional clients using a Unified Trading Account (UTA), you can use the “ GET wallet balance ” RESTful endpoint or subscribe to the WebSocket “wallet ” topic to obtain the UTA’s accountIMRate (Initial Margin Rate) and accountMMRate (Maintenance Margin Rate) to monitor the account’s risk level. API documentation: https://bybit-exchange.github.io/docs/v5/account/wallet-balance https://bybit-exchange.github.io/docs/v5/websocket/private/wallet Formula for Initial Margin Rate and Maintenance Margin Rate: https://www.bybithelp.com/en-US/s/article/Glossary-Unified-Trading-Account This document explains our UTA liquidation rules. Liquidation is triggered when the account’s Maintenance Margin Rate (MMR) reaches 100%. https://www.bybit.com/en/help-center/article/UTA-Trading-Rules#d As we look toward 2025 and beyond, what do you believe will define the next stage of institutional adoption — and how is Bybit’s B2B unit preparing to stay ahead of those shifts? I believe the sign for the next stage of institutional adoption is when the focus shifts from the mere ownership or allocation of crypto to the integration of crypto as a more foundational element within business models, operations, and balance sheets. When we stop asking specific questions about crypto as the other side of traditional finance or as an alternative asset, but instead view it simply as an asset. The focus is shifting from mere ownership or allocation of crypto and digital assets to their integration as foundational elements within business models, operations, product lines, and balance sheets.

The Bank of England just dropped a bombshell proposal that could reshape your cryptocurrency strategy. In a move that’s sending ripples through the crypto world, the central bank wants to cap individual stablecoin holdings at £20,000. This dramatic limit represents one of the most significant regulatory interventions in the digital asset space to date. What Does the Stablecoin Holdings Limit Mean for You? The proposed £20,000 cap on stablecoin holdings translates to approximately $25,360 per person. This restriction aims to protect consumers from potential systemic risks in the rapidly growing stablecoin market. However, it also raises important questions about financial freedom and regulatory overreach in the digital age. Consider these key implications: Individual investors cannot hold more than £20,000 in any single stablecoin The limit applies per person, not per wallet or exchange Both retail and institutional investors face these restrictions Existing holdings above the limit would need to be reduced Why is the Bank of England Targeting Stablecoin Holdings? The Bank of England’s concern stems from the massive growth in stablecoin usage. These digital assets, typically pegged to traditional currencies like the pound or dollar, have become fundamental to cryptocurrency trading and decentralized finance. Regulators worry that without proper controls, stablecoin holdings could create financial instability. Moreover, the central bank recognizes that large-scale stablecoin holdings present unique challenges. Unlike traditional bank deposits, these assets often lack the same consumer protections and regulatory oversight. The proposed limit serves as a precautionary measure while more comprehensive frameworks develop. How Will This Affect Your Crypto Strategy? If you’re actively involved in cryptocurrency, this stablecoin holdings limit demands immediate attention. Many traders use stablecoins as parking spots between trades or as hedges against market volatility. The £20,000 cap could significantly impact these strategies. Here are practical steps to consider: Diversify across multiple stablecoins – No single stablecoin can exceed your limit Explore alternative liquidity options – Consider traditional banking channels Monitor regulatory developments – Rules may evolve as the market matures Review your current positions – Ensure compliance if the proposal becomes law What’s the Global Context for Stablecoin Regulation? The Bank of England isn’t alone in scrutinizing stablecoin holdings. Regulatory bodies worldwide are grappling with how to manage these digital assets. The European Union’s MiCA framework, the US’s ongoing legislative efforts, and Asian regulatory approaches all reflect similar concerns about financial stability and consumer protection. However, the UK’s proposed limit stands out for its specificity. While other jurisdictions focus on issuer requirements and reserve backing, the Bank of England directly addresses individual exposure levels. This approach could influence global regulatory trends and shape how other central banks view stablecoin holdings. Navigating the Future of Stablecoin Investments As the consultation period progresses, market participants should prepare for potential changes to their stablecoin holdings management. The proposal signals a new era of cryptocurrency regulation where traditional financial oversight meets digital innovation. Remember that regulation often brings both challenges and opportunities. While limits may restrict certain strategies, they also provide clearer frameworks for legitimate operations. The key is staying informed and adapting your approach as the regulatory landscape evolves. Frequently Asked Questions When will the stablecoin holdings limit take effect? The proposal is currently in consultation phase. Implementation timing depends on feedback received and subsequent parliamentary processes, likely taking several months. Does the limit apply to all types of stablecoins? The proposal covers all stablecoins pegged to traditional currencies, regardless of their underlying technology or issuer. How will the Bank of England enforce this limit? Enforcement mechanisms are still under discussion, but likely involve cooperation with exchanges and wallet providers to monitor compliance. Can I hold £20,000 in multiple different stablecoins? The proposal suggests the limit applies per person across all stablecoin holdings, not per individual stablecoin type. What happens if I already hold more than £20,000 in stablecoins? Transition arrangements would likely allow a reasonable period to reduce holdings to compliant levels. Are there any exemptions to the stablecoin holdings limit? The consultation document doesn’t specify exemptions, but regulated financial institutions might operate under different rules.

If you’re using Bithumb for your AVAX transactions, you’ll want to mark your calendar. The South Korean exchange has just announced a temporary suspension of AVAX deposits and withdrawals to support an important network upgrade. This proactive move ensures the platform remains secure and up-to-date with the latest blockchain improvements. Why Are AVAX Deposits and withdrawals Being Temporarily Suspended? Bithumb is taking this necessary step to support the Avalanche mainnet upgrade, which represents significant progress for the network. When blockchain networks undergo upgrades, exchanges must temporarily pause services to ensure smooth integration and prevent potential issues. This temporary suspension affects multiple tokens operating on the Avalanche network, not just AVAX itself. Which Tokens and Services Are Affected? The suspension impacts several popular tokens that utilize the Avalanche network. Here’s what you need to know: AVAX – The native token of the Avalanche network FITFI – Step App’s governance token JOE – Trader Joe’s exchange token NXPC – Naxap’s utility token Important to note: trading of these tokens will remain active during this period. Only deposits and withdrawals are temporarily paused. When Will AVAX Deposits and Withdrawals Resume? The suspension begins precisely at 9:00 a.m. UTC on July 19. While Bithumb hasn’t provided an exact end time, these maintenance windows typically last several hours. The exchange will announce when AVAX deposits and withdrawals resume normal operation through their official channels. We recommend monitoring their announcements page for the latest updates. What Should Traders Do During This Period? If you regularly use AVAX deposits and withdrawals, planning ahead is crucial. Consider these actionable steps: Complete any urgent transactions before the suspension begins Monitor Bithumb’s official communication channels for updates Remember that trading continues unaffected during this period Keep your assets secure in your preferred wallet during the upgrade Why Network Upgrades Matter for Your Crypto Assets Blockchain upgrades like this Avalanche mainnet improvement bring enhanced features, better security, and improved performance. While temporary suspensions of AVAX deposits and withdrawals might cause minor inconvenience, they ultimately benefit the entire ecosystem. These upgrades often introduce faster transaction times, lower fees, and new capabilities that improve your overall trading experience. Looking Beyond the Temporary Pause Once the upgrade completes and AVAX deposits and withdrawals resume, users can expect a more robust and efficient network. The temporary inconvenience pays off through long-term benefits including enhanced network stability and potentially new features that could increase the value and utility of your Avalanche-based assets. Bithumb’s proactive approach to handling network upgrades demonstrates their commitment to platform security and user asset protection. While the temporary suspension of AVAX deposits and withdrawals requires some planning from users, it ultimately contributes to a safer and more advanced trading environment for everyone involved in the Avalanche ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions How long will the AVAX deposits and withdrawals suspension last? While Bithumb hasn’t specified an exact duration, similar network upgrades typically take several hours. The exchange will announce when services resume. Can I still trade AVAX and other affected tokens during this period? Yes, trading continues normally. Only deposits and withdrawals are temporarily suspended. Will my existing AVAX holdings be safe during the upgrade? Absolutely. Your assets remain secure in your Bithumb account throughout the maintenance period. Should I move my AVAX to another wallet before the suspension? Only if you need immediate access during the maintenance window. Otherwise, leaving assets in your Bithumb account is perfectly safe. How will I know when AVAX deposits and withdrawals resume? Bithumb will make an official announcement through their website and social media channels when services are restored. Are other exchanges also suspending AVAX services? Other exchanges supporting Avalanche may implement similar temporary suspensions. Check with your specific exchange for their maintenance schedule. Found this update helpful?

Accordingly, US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Acting Chair Caroline Pham announced that the agency is in talks with registered exchanges to launch spot cryptocurrency services early next month. Pham noted that these discussions not only involve major exchanges like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the Cboe Futures Exchange, but also companies like Coinbase Derivatives, Kalshi, and Polymarket US. The talks reportedly covered the launch of various spot cryptocurrency trading products, including leveraged products. “We are continuing to work with Congress to bring regulatory clarity to these markets, while also using our existing authorities to swiftly implement the recommendations in the President’s Digital Asset Markets Working Group report,” Pham said. This move by the CFTC was interpreted as signaling a significant shift in the approach of US regulators to cryptocurrency markets. Rather than waiting for Congress to give the CFTC explicit authority over spot crypto markets, Pham is taking advantage of existing provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act that require retail trading of commodities with leverage, margin, or financing to occur on regulated exchanges. While leveraged spot crypto trading products have been widely available on offshore crypto exchanges for years, offering them on CFTC-regulated platforms will bring institutional-level oversight, risk management standards, and investor protections to leveraged crypto trading in the U.S. market for the first time. As is known, US President Donald Trump has nominated SEC official Mike Selig to replace Caroline Pham, but due to the government shutdown, it remains unclear when Selig will be confirmed by the Senate. *This is not investment advice.

Key Takeaways: Japan’s FSA plans new registration rules requiring crypto firms to register with regulators before working with exchanges. The proposal follows the 2024 DMM Bitcoin hack, which exposed vulnerabilities in outsourced trading management systems. The initiative comes amid Japan’s effort to strengthen digital asset security. A working group under the Financial System Council, an advisory body to the Japanese Prime Minister, met on Nov. 7 to discuss the proposal, according to a report from Nikkei . Japan Proposes Mandatory Registration for Crypto Custody, Trading Service Providers The plan would require all third-party custody and trading management firms to register with regulators before offering services to crypto exchanges. Exchanges, in turn, would be required to use only systems developed by registered entities. Under Japan’s current framework, crypto exchanges must meet strict requirements for safeguarding deposits, such as storing client assets in cold wallets, but no similar rules apply to external service providers. Regulators say this has created a security gap, leaving exchanges exposed to theft and system risks. The issue gained urgency after the DMM Bitcoin hack in 2024 , one of Japan’s largest crypto thefts, in which 48.2 billion yen ($312 million) worth of Bitcoin was stolen. The breach was traced to Ginco, a Tokyo-based software firm that managed DMM’s trading systems, highlighting weaknesses in outsourced service oversight. Most members of the council’s working group reportedly backed the new registration system, emphasizing the need for clearer regulation in the growing crypto ecosystem. The FSA intends to compile a formal report and submit proposed amendments to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act during the 2026 ordinary Diet session. The initiative comes as Japan’s regulators step up efforts to balance innovation and investor protection. Last month, the FSA approved the country’s first yen-backed stablecoin, JPYC, and recently confirmed plans to support a stablecoin pilot project with Japan’s three largest banks, Mizuho, MUFG, and SMBC, as part of its broader digital finance agenda. Japan’s FSA Approves Joint Stablecoin Pilot by Three Major Banks As reported, Japan’s FSA has approved a joint stablecoin pilot by Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, and Mizuho Financial Group, marking the first project under its new Payment Innovation Project (PIP). The regulator said it would support the initiative, which aims to enhance payment efficiency and corporate productivity across Japan’s financial sector. “insider” news leaked!

The consortium may later introduce a dollar-pegged version to compete with USDT and USDC. The project will involve Mitsubishi Corporation as a business partner, Progmat for technical infrastructure, and Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking Corporation for trust functions, with pilot testing expected to begin in November 2025. The move comes as Japan accelerates its stablecoin adoption strategy. The Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA) recently formalized a framework to self-regulate stablecoins, following the FSA’s approval of the country’s first yen-backed stablecoin, JPYC, last month. The FSA called the new multi-bank pilot an “innovative effort” that reflects Japan’s growing push to modernize its payments ecosystem.

Have you been tracking the recent turbulence in cryptocurrency markets? Digital asset investment products just recorded a staggering $1.17 billion net outflow, marking the second consecutive week of significant withdrawals. This massive movement of funds reveals crucial insights about investor sentiment and market dynamics that every crypto enthusiast should understand. What’s Driving the Digital Asset Investment Products Exodus? The recent data from CoinShares reveals a dramatic shift in investor behavior. Digital asset investment products experienced substantial outflows totaling $1.17 billion last week alone. This represents the second week in a row where more money left than entered these investment vehicles. The scale of this movement suggests investors are reacting to broader market conditions and reassessing their cryptocurrency exposure. Several factors could be influencing this trend. Market volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and shifting risk appetite all play roles in these investment decisions. However, the story isn’t uniformly negative across all digital asset investment products, as we’ll discover in the following sections. Bitcoin and Ethereum: The Major Outflow Stories When we break down the numbers, the picture becomes even more revealing. Bitcoin investment products bore the brunt of the outflows with $932 million withdrawn. This represents nearly 80% of the total outflows from digital asset investment products. The scale of Bitcoin’s outflow indicates significant institutional repositioning. Meanwhile, Ethereum products saw $438 million in outflows. This substantial withdrawal from the second-largest cryptocurrency suggests investors are taking profits or reducing exposure across multiple major digital assets. The simultaneous outflows from both Bitcoin and Ethereum highlight broader market caution. Bitcoin outflows: $932 million Ethereum outflows: $438 million Total weekly outflows: $1.17 billion Why is Solana Bucking the Trend? Amid the widespread outflows, Solana investment products presented a surprising contrast. They attracted $118 million in inflows during the same period. This positive movement demonstrates that not all digital asset investment products are experiencing the same investor sentiment. Even more impressive is Solana’s longer-term performance. Over the past nine weeks, Solana investment products have accumulated $2.1 billion in total inflows. This sustained interest suggests investors see unique value propositions in alternative digital asset investment products beyond the market leaders. What Do These Digital Asset Investment Product Flows Mean for Investors? Understanding these flows in digital asset investment products provides valuable market intelligence. Large outflows often indicate profit-taking or risk reduction, while sustained inflows into specific assets like Solana suggest growing confidence in particular blockchain ecosystems. For current investors, these patterns offer several actionable insights. First, diversification across different digital asset investment products might help manage risk. Second, monitoring flow data can provide early signals about market sentiment shifts. Finally, the contrasting performance between assets highlights the importance of fundamental research. Navigating the Future of Digital Asset Investment Products The current outflow from digital asset investment products doesn’t necessarily signal long-term bearishness. Historical data shows that cryptocurrency markets often experience periods of consolidation after significant rallies. These outflows could represent healthy profit-taking rather than loss of fundamental confidence. Moreover, the continued inflows into Solana digital asset investment products demonstrate that investor interest in blockchain technology remains strong. The key takeaway is that the digital asset landscape is maturing, with more nuanced investment patterns emerging. Frequently Asked Questions What caused the $1.17 billion outflow from digital asset investment products? The outflow likely resulted from combined factors including profit-taking after recent price increases, broader market uncertainty, and institutional portfolio rebalancing. Why did Solana see inflows while Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced outflows? Solana’s strong technical performance, growing ecosystem, and relative undervaluation compared to larger cryptocurrencies attracted continued investor interest despite broader market outflows. Are these outflows a bearish signal for cryptocurrency markets? Not necessarily. Outflows can represent healthy profit-taking and don’t always indicate long-term bearish sentiment, especially when specific assets like Solana continue attracting investment. How often does CoinShares report these flow numbers? CoinShares typically releases digital asset investment product flow data weekly, providing regular insights into institutional and large investor behavior. Should I be concerned about my digital asset investments? Market fluctuations are normal in cryptocurrency investing. Focus on your long-term strategy, diversification, and fundamental research rather than reacting to short-term flow data. Where can I track these digital asset investment product flows? CoinShares provides regular reports, and many financial news platforms cover significant movements in digital asset investment products. Found this analysis helpful?

The entire market sentiment is somewhat fragile following heavy selling pressure from large holders, and on-chain data points to major whale movements that may be adding to the downtrend. High-profile entities, including the Winklevoss Twins’ Gemini Custody wallets and early Bitcoin miner Owen Gunden, have surfaced as key players in this wave of transactions that could be influencing Bitcoin’s recent price action. Winklevoss Twins Move Millions In BTC From Gemini Custody According to blockchain data, wallets linked to Winklevoss Capital and Gemini Custody have been consistently transferring large amounts of Bitcoin over the past several months in an ongoing deliberate adjustment of their holdings. These movements have occurred in several phases, often involving sizeable transactions that appear timed. The latest transaction stands out, showing 250 BTC, worth approximately $25.45 million at current prices, moved to a Gemini hot wallet just hours ago. Related Reading: New XRP ETF Just Dropped, But Will Anything Be Different This Time? If these transfers correspond to sales, it would mean that the twins have been methodically unloading their Bitcoin positions over time rather than engaging in sudden bulk liquidations. Cumulatively, they have now effectively liquidated over 9,000 BTC, equivalent to around $900 million, since the start of 2025. This has caused their holdings to fall from roughly 24,000 BTC earlier in the year to under 16,000 BTC right now. Bitcoin OG Owen Gunden Moves Final Holdings Toward Exchanges Another major wallet attracting attention belongs to Owen Gunden, an early Bitcoin miner and Genesis creditor. Data from on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain reveals that Gunden recently initiated large transfers totaling 3,549 BTC (around $361.8 million) in a single transaction just eight hours ago. Related Reading: Pundit Highlights Major Move For XRP And RLUSD, Will Price Follow? The move follows earlier transactions this week, including 3,601 BTC ($372.1 million) sent one day prior. Notably, approximately 600 BTC from these transfers, worth over $61 million, have already been deposited on Kraken, signaling possible liquidation. These movements have reduced Gunden’s total holdings from around 11,000 BTC to nearly zero. Such large transfers to exchange-linked wallets often precede sell orders, contributing to short-term selling pressure. The Gunden transfers, alongside similar large movements like those from the Winklevoss twins, are among several whale sell events recorded in November that have added to Bitcoin’s persistent selling pressure. This trend is apparent in the broader institutional market, where US-based Spot Bitcoin ETFs have also seen sustained outflows. Data shows that Friday of last week closed with $558.44 million leaving these funds. The combined effect of these whale movements presents a concerning outlook for Bitcoin’s short-term trend. However, this weekend has been highlighted by another green weekend for Bitcoin. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $106,270, up by 4.4% in the past 24 hours. This follows a string of green weekends over the past four weeks, which were immediately reversed on the following monday.

Investors now seek projects with real technology, strong demand, and transparent revenue systems. This new cycle favors function over hype, pushing decentralized finance into its most serious growth phase yet. Ethereum (ETH) and XRP continue to hold top positions in institutional portfolios, but a rising DeFi crypto named Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is starting to dominate investor discussions. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) combines lending, staking, and stablecoin innovation into one system. It is designed to attract both retail and institutional users through a model that blends yield generation with smart lending logic. As traders hunt for the next wave of projects with 1,000% ROI potential by 2026, these three tokens—Mutuum Finance (MUTM), Ethereum (ETH), and XRP—stand out for distinct reasons. One represents the new frontier of DeFi, while the others define the legacy pillars of the market. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum (ETH) remains the foundation of decentralized finance. Over 60% of all decentralized applications still run on its network. With scaling improvements from Layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum, Base, and zkSync, Ethereum continues to grow stronger in performance and user adoption. Analysts expect ETH to trade between $8,000 and $10,000 by 2026, a gain of around 300%. While that is significant, Ethereum’s large market cap limits its explosive upside compared to early-stage tokens. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), still in presale, begins from a far smaller base, where each user and transaction will have a direct impact on growth. XRP XRP remains favored among institutions for cross-border payments. Ripple’s banking partnerships and regulatory clarity have strengthened its role in global settlements. Analysts target XRP between $3.00 and $3.50 by 2026, marking a potential 4x to 6x rise. Yet XRP functions mainly as a settlement token, not as a yield generator. It lacks the staking and lending utilities that make Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a full DeFi crypto ecosystem rather than a single-purpose asset. XRP serves banks, while Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will serve everyday investors seeking active income and flexible lending exposure. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): The DeFi Disruptor Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t just another presale token. It is preparing to launch its full DeFi platform and token together, a synchronized rollout that will bring instant liquidity when trading begins. The project’s total supply is 4B MUTM, and it is now in Presale Phase 6, priced at $0.035. Over $18.55 million has already been raised from more than 17,900 holders in all phases, with 87% of this phase’s 170 million supply sold out. The next phase will move the price to $0.040, representing a 15% increase for new entrants. This pricing stage marks a final opportunity for early participants before the next price shift. Analysts tracking its steady phase progression estimate that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will deliver between 200% and 400% growth by launch. The projected post listing range between $0.35 and $0.40 sets the stage for 10x to 15x returns within the next cycle. A participant who invested $5,000 in Phase 2 at $0.015 now holds tokens valued around $12K at current prices. At $0.35, that stake reaches $116K, confirming the project’s exponential potential. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also stands out for accessibility. Investors can now purchase tokens directly using debit or credit cards with no buying limits, allowing broader entry for global participants. Its design builds on two distinct lending systems. The Peer-to-Contract model serves stable assets like BTC and USDT. These pools dynamically adjust their yields according to liquidity use, rewarding suppliers as utilization increases. The Peer-to-Peer model, in contrast, supports higher-risk assets such as DOGE or SHIB, where users decide loan terms and rates themselves. This flexible approach caters to both conservative and adventurous lenders in the same ecosystem. The platform’s revenue cycle is built for sustainability. Fees from lending activities will fund open-market MUTM buybacks, and the purchased tokens will be distributed to mtToken stakers as rewards. This continuous loop of revenue and redistribution builds steady token demand while rewarding community loyalty. Stability Factor and Coming V1 Protocol Launch Borrowers also benefit from a stable interest model. They will be able to lock repayment rates, giving them predictability even when market conditions fluctuate. When the variable market rate changes sharply, the protocol adjusts stable loans automatically to maintain fairness. All loans remain overcollateralized, with the Stability Factor constantly tracking safety margins. When the collateral value drops below set thresholds, liquidation occurs instantly. For example, a user depositing $10,000 in ETH will borrow up to $7,500, and if the collateral declines by 20%, the system will restore balance through controlled liquidation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has disclosed through its official X profile that the V1 of its protocol is set to be introduced on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. This early release will activate the platform’s primary systems, including the liquidity pool, the mtToken and debt token frameworks, along with an automated liquidator bot designed to keep positions balanced and the market functioning smoothly. During this phase, users will be able to borrow and lend assets, using ETH or USDT as collateral. By launching V1 on a testnet first, the team provides users with hands-on access before the full mainnet rollout. This allows the community to understand the platform’s mechanics, build trust through real usage, and gradually attract more participants. As adoption grows, it may lead to increased attention and long-term demand for the MUTM token. Conclusion: The DeFi Token That Defines the Next Wave Ethereum shapes the infrastructure of Web3, and XRP powers the world’s payment rails, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) brings both lending and reward mechanics into one accessible platform. With 87% of Phase 6 already sold and the next price increase approaching, this presale stage marks the last entry at this price level point before broader exposure begins. By 2026, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is set to become the standout among the cheapest cryptocurrency projects evolving into major DeFi powerhouses. As investors search for the next big defi crypto capable of delivering real 1,000% returns, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) leads the list. Its technology, revenue design, and presale timing align perfectly with the new market cycle. Those who join before the next phase will likely secure positions that define the next chapter of DeFi growth.

In a video shared by crypto commentator Xaif (@Xaif_Crypto), Marszalek discussed the future of altcoin investments and referenced forecasts highlighting large-scale inflows if an XRP ETF is launched. He emphasized that in the next few years, digital assets with solid capital inflows could outperform others, noting that “there’s a forecast saying that the ETF for XRP is going to attract $8 billion of inflows next year.” https://t.co/YoOCWnM3lz CEO Kris Marszalek says an $XRP ETF could pull in up to $8B in its first year He’s already projecting it… You better be ready for this. pic.twitter.com/KkzueD0k1D — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) November 8, 2025 Are Institutions Preparing for XRP? Xaif and many other market participants view Marszalek’s comments as an indication of growing institutional interest in XRP and its potential to drive new liquidity into the market. Although the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has yet to make any official announcement regarding such a product, Marszalek’s statement adds momentum to ongoing discussions in the community. Franklin Templeton recently modified the language in its ETF filing , and many community members see this as a sign of an impending launch. The DTCC has also listed over 9 XRP ETFs , suggesting these products are also near approval. Spot XRP ETFs are the next major step toward expanding access to digital assets through traditional financial channels. The introduction of ETFs for established cryptocurrencies has historically improved market liquidity and encouraged broader adoption among institutional investors. Marszalek’s comments suggest that Crypto.com may position itself strategically for this development. He mentioned that the company has a “clear, differentiated, exciting strategy that nobody else is pursuing,” signaling a commitment to innovation in digital finance. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 While he did not specify how this strategy relates to potential ETF participation or XRP exposure, the remarks indicate confidence in the exchange’s direction as it anticipates billions of inflows into the XRP market . A Potential Turning Point for XRP If the $8 billion projection materializes, an XRP ETF could significantly influence the token’s trading volume and valuation. Such inflows would reflect a substantial shift in investor sentiment toward regulated crypto instruments, reinforcing XRP’s standing as one of the most established digital assets. Despite regulatory uncertainties around XRP in recent years, the market’s anticipation for structured investment vehicles remains strong . As Marszalek concluded, “We will build it and I hope you guys join along for the ride,” a statement that shows the confidence driving both Crypto.com’s outlook and the wider industry’s expectations for what could become a landmark development in cryptocurrency investing.

The vote came after weeks of stalled talks in Washington that had restricted access to federal economic data. The lack of data had made it harder for traders to evaluate interest rate expectations. The new progress immediately showed in U.S. stock futures, which had finished the prior week under pressure from concerns tied to high artificial intelligence stock valuations. S&P 500 futures surged by 0.76%, Dow Jones futures added 112 points or 0.24%, and Nasdaq-100 futures rallied by 1.29% during early Monday trading. Last week had been rough for major indexes, with the Nasdaq Composite recording its worst weekly performance since April, crashing by 3%, while the S&P 500 declined by 1.6%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 1.2%. Asia stocks are posting broad gains after selloff pressure eased Across Asia-Pacific, equities also moved higher on Monday. South Korea’s Kospi rose 3.02% to 4,073.24. The Kosdaq gained 1.32% to 888.35. Major names advanced, with Samsung Electronics higher by 2.76% and SK Hynix up 4.48%. SK Inc, the holding company for one of the country’s largest chaebols, rallied by 9.29%. GS Holdings, active in energy, retail, and construction, climbed 11.79%. In Japan , the Nikkei 225 gained 1.26% to 50,911.76, and the Topix index rose 0.56% to 3,317.42. 10-year Japanese government bond yields touched 1.7%, their highest level since October.

In Europe, the Stoxx 600 index rose 1% during the morning session. The FTSE in the United Kingdom increased 0.5%, Germany’s DAX gained 1.4%, France’s CAC 40 advanced 1%, and Italy’s FTSE MIB also increased 1%. Nearly every sector moved positive as investors reacted to the new developments in the U.S. policy environment. The trend reflected improving confidence that government operations may soon stabilize, which would allow firmer expectations for economic projections. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar gained 0.35% against the yen, trading at 153.98, near a nine-month high from earlier in the month. The Australian dollar appreciated 0.55% to $0.6532 and strengthened over 1% against the yen. Frances Cheung, head of foreign-exchange and rates strategy at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. , said , “Monday’s market moves, including dollar losses against risk-proxy currencies, reflected hopes that the U.S. government would reopen.” Precious metals also saw buying interest.

According to Martinez, the token is forming a bullish flag on the monthly chart, a classic continuation pattern that often precedes major price breakouts. His view suggests that a brief pullback could create the conditions needed to propel XRP toward double-digit prices. “XRP is forming a bullish flag, and a dip to $1.90 could be the spark for a rally toward $10,” Martinez wrote. The dream scenario: $XRP is forming a bullish flag, and a dip to $1.90 could be the spark for a rally toward $10. pic.twitter.com/LpTiPQ1FQG — Ali (@ali_charts) November 9, 2025 A bullish flag forms when an asset experiences a sharp upward price movement, followed by a period of sideways or slightly downward consolidation, with consolidation usually taking place within parallel trend lines, resembling a flag on a pole. The initial surge is known as the flagpole, and the price action that follows represents a pause in momentum rather than a reversal. Once the pattern matures, breaking above the upper trend line typically signals trend continuation. XRP price action In XRP’s case, the initial rally earlier this year created the flagpole, while recent monthly candles have moved within a narrowing range between approximately $1.90 and $3.10. Martinez’s chart indicates that a retest of the lower boundary around $1.90 would maintain the structure, potentially attracting buyers who view the level as key support. A confirmed breakout above the $3.30 to $3.50 resistance zone would then validate the pattern and open the door for a measured move toward $10 based on historical price behavior and technical projection. At the time of writing, the token is trading at $2.51, up 10.27% over the past 24 hours with a market cap of $152 billion. If XRP were to hit $10 it would have a market cap of roughly $600 billion, the largest in the token’s history.

The financial world’s attention is laser-focused on Washington, where a potential resolution to the government shutdown could trigger significant market movements. This delicate balance in Asia FX markets reflects the cautious optimism among investors awaiting clarity on US fiscal policy. Asia FX Markets in Holding Pattern Most Asian currencies are trading within tight ranges as market participants adopt a wait-and-see approach. The Japanese yen, Chinese yuan, and other major Asian currencies are showing limited volatility despite ongoing economic uncertainties. This muted performance in Asia FX reflects several key factors: Reduced trading volumes during Asian session hours Caution ahead of potential US policy changes Balanced risk sentiment among regional investors Technical resistance levels limiting price movements Dollar Steady Amid Political Uncertainty The US dollar continues to demonstrate remarkable stability against major counterparts, with the dollar index hovering near recent highs. This dollar steady performance comes despite ongoing political negotiations in Washington. Market analysts attribute this resilience to several supporting factors: Factor Impact on Dollar Market Reaction Safe-haven demand Positive Moderate buying interest Interest rate expectations Neutral Limited price action Global risk sentiment Mixed Balanced flows Government Shutdown Resolution Prospects The potential end to the government shutdown represents a critical inflection point for currency markets. A successful resolution could trigger several immediate effects on currency markets: Reduced safe-haven demand for the US dollar Increased risk appetite supporting Asian currencies Normalization of US economic data releases Improved global economic confidence Currency Markets Await Direction Global currency markets are positioned for potential volatility once political clarity emerges. The current calm in currency markets masks underlying tension as traders prepare for multiple scenarios. Key levels to watch include: Major support and resistance levels for Asian pairs Dollar index technical formations Options market positioning Institutional flow patterns Economic Trends and Forward Outlook The broader economic trends suggest that currency movements will remain data-dependent in the coming sessions. Current economic trends indicate: Region Economic Outlook Currency Impact Asia Moderate growth Selective strength United States Policy-dependent Dollar sensitivity Global Cautious optimism Risk-on potential FAQs Which Asian currencies are most affected by US government shutdown developments? The Japanese yen and Chinese yuan typically show the strongest reactions, though all Asia FX pairs experience some impact. How long can the dollar remain steady amid political uncertainty? Historical patterns suggest the dollar can maintain stability for extended periods, though technical breaks often precede significant moves. What immediate effects would a government shutdown resolution have? Expect reduced volatility premiums, normalized trading conditions, and potential risk-on flows into Asian assets. Which economic indicators should traders monitor closely? US employment data, inflation figures, and Asian export numbers will provide crucial directional signals. How are major financial institutions positioned for this event? Most maintain balanced exposure with contingency plans for sudden market movements in either direction. The current market environment presents both challenges and opportunities for currency traders. The resolution of political uncertainty in Washington could unlock significant movement across Asia FX pairs, while the dollar’s steady performance provides a stable baseline for strategic positioning. Market participants should remain vigilant for breakouts while managing risk exposure carefully during this transitional period.

Maxi Doge Nears $4M as XRP ETF Buzz Builds,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/xrp-etf-hope-government-shutdown-maxi-doge-next-1000x-crypto/,"What to Know: ETF chatter around $XRP is building even as policy noise persists, a mix that often seeds sharp risk rotations if clarity arrives. Relief rallies during shutdown headlines show risk demand isn’t gone; it’s tactical and catalyst-driven, favoring liquid beta first. Meme coin projects with simple hooks can capture reflexive flows faster than heavier utility plays during early-cycle rotations. Maxi Doge’s crypto presale packages an impressive $3.9M+ raise and a meme-first roadmap aimed at community-driven engagement in 2025–2026. The market is still nursing its bruises from October’s wipeout, yet the narrative backdrop just got more interesting. Last Friday, November 7, Canary Capital teased an upcoming $XRP spot ETF on X. Canary’s SEC filing reveals that the fund will trade under the ticker XRPC and give investors traditional market exposure to XRP without direct crypto custody. It holds only $XRP and cash, steering clear of derivatives or leverage, and comes with an annual management fee of 0.5%. Crypto outlet Bitcoinsensus also flagged how talk of XRPC is swelling even as the US government shutdown drags on, keeping macro nerves frayed and liquidity patchy. That combination of cautious price action with new-issue optimism is exactly the kind of split tape that sends capital hunting for asymmetry. Signs of relief matter. Data from Yahoo Finance showed $BTC, $ETH, and $XRP catching a bounce as hopes of a Democrat-Republican deal to end the shutdown improved. What this means is that risk appetite isn’t dead; it’s just waiting for policy clarity. For now, momentum points sideways, but the bid returns quickly when the fog lifts. At the same time, the ETF pipeline continues to inch forward. Canary Capital also plans to launch spot funds tied to Litecoin and Hedera despite the government shutdown, which speaks to a more streamlined, rules-based path for crypto products. $XRP filings have progressed with amended paperwork that edges the discussion closer to SEC action. FX Empire’s $XRP ETF chatter has even floated a near-term launch window and healthy first-month inflow expectations if an $XRP product clears. That shift matters for traders. If ETF headlines continue landing while macro steadies, beta can broaden fast. That’s the setup pushing some to scout presales again. For traders watching risk rotations, a meme coin-led token that leans into staking and community hype is a familiar, high-beta expression of the market optimism bubbling beyond the surface. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is trying to slot into that lane with its strong presale momentum and high-octane meme narrative. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) – Meme Beta with Audited Contract and Degen Branding Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is an Ethereum token that wraps meme energy around simple utility: stake for rewards, join weekly trading contests, and plug into partner events to test your futures trading skills. The idea is straightforward – keep fundamentals community-focused, lower friction, and let viral culture do the heavy lifting when the market mood flips. Throughout the presale, the project rewards early adopters with dynamic staking rewards from a 5% tokenomics pool. Right now, the rewards sit at 78% APY, with over 9.6B tokens staked to date. And when the $MAXI coin hits Uniswap and other exchanges after the listing, the team will roll out weekly competitions and trading tournaments with rewards for top leaderboard scorers. 👉 Read more about the Maxi Doge project and its potential in our guide to buying $MAXI. With these contests, Maxi Doge doubles down on its ‘degen’ crypto bro branding – a cultural wink to traders who thrive on volatility and humor as much as alpha. In crypto, being a degen isn’t reckless; it’s a flex of conviction and community, and the project channels that ethos by wrapping staking, trading contests, and viral engagement into a single, meme-powered ecosystem. That positioning matters now: as ETF chatter revives risk appetite and capital starts rotating toward high-beta plays, tokens with personality and participation hooks like $MAXI often become the first beneficiaries of returning liquidity. Visit the official $MAXI presale website now. Maxi Doge Presale Nears $4M and Targets 78% Staking Yield Presales live and die on clear mechanics. Here the numbers are doing the talking for Maxi Doge’s presale: over $3.9M raised so far, a current stage price around $0.0002675, and attention-grabbing 78% staking rewards during the sale period. High APYs hint at early-stage incentive design rather than sustainable yield, but they also encourage stickier behavior into and just after listing. For traders calibrating the next 1000x crypto narratives, that combination of low unit price and visible staking carrot is exactly what sparks the first wave of on-chain momentum when sentiment turns. Distribution and rollout also matter. The roadmap points to DEX and CEX listings after the presale with contests and partner events designed to keep the timeline noisy. Staking allocations and liquidity provisions aim to seed activity without smothering it, while $MAXI’s token audit trail helps reduce first-day jitters. None of that removes risk – meme coins are still volatility engines – but in a market where ETF headlines are coaxing sidelined capital back into beta, $MAXI has the right mechanics to be noticed quickly. 🚀 Ready to jump in? Secure your Maxi Doge ($MAXI) presale slot. Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. Always do your own research. Presales are highly risky, yields are variable, and meme coins can experience severe volatility and liquidity gaps.

Zhao posted on X that users should not buy handles he follows. “I will unfollow any sold accounts. If you see an account for sale, let me know. DM, tweet, notify interns,” he wrote on Monday. The ex-Binance CEO added that he follows accounts randomly because they are “supportive, informative, positive energy people in the community.” Selling ‘followed by CZ’ accounts for 3,000 USDT Zhao made the caution, reacting to a post from an influencer on X, who noted that “Big Cousin,” a nickname used by the Chinese-speaking crypto community for CZ, had started unfollowing several accounts recently. The influencer said it was “a good thing” because some users had “done bad things under the banner of being followed by CZ.” Don't buy handles that I follow. I will unfollow any sold accounts. If you see an account for sale, let me know. DM, tweet, notify ""interns"". I follow accounts ""randomly"", usually supportive, informative, positive energy people in the community. https://t.co/655fSK9h4S — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) November 10, 2025 The influencer added that in 2022, an account followed by CZ could fetch up to 20,000 USDT, with some buyers reportedly paying around 3,000 USDT for a handle that later lost the coveted follow. “If it’s just for that ‘been followed by CZ’ kind of celebrity-chasing psychology, it can still be understood,” the influencer wrote, “but the most worrying thing is these accounts falling into the hands of criminals, being used for scams and rug pulls.” Asian-based journalist Linwan had confirmed that Zhao had unfollowed 384 accounts in a single day on November 8. “Before November, CZ’s unfollows were sporadic, but on November 8, he unfollowed over three hundred accounts, which feels like a systematic purge of his follow list.” According to Linwan’s investigations, the mass unfollowing was on specified categories of users, including projects Binance had exited, investment fund managers with differing views, and industry media that had been bad-mouthing the exchange during its regulatory battles, on top of Zhao’s recent US presidential pardon . 384 accounts purged by CZ in November, reasons not clear Among the accounts CZ removed from his following list were projects previously supported by Binance, including BakerySwap, TopGoal, Bundle, KOI, CommEX, and ReachMe.

The “purge” also included notable industry names such as Olaf Carlson-Wee of Polychain Capital, Scott Lewis of DeFi Pulse, Darryl Wang of Tangent, Tushar Aggarwal of Persistence, and Howard Yuan of Shard Capital. According to Lian, these individuals had recently advocated for “multi-centralized trading” and reduced dependence on Binance, ideas that may have clashed with Zhao’s positions. Media figures like Mira Christanto of Messari, Angie Lau of Forkast, and analyst Trista Kelley were also among those unfollowed, alongside former Binance executives Ling Zhang, the exchange’s former investment director, and Cobo founder Lü Xujun.

Details Here",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/qcp-capital-announces-critical-levels-for-bitcoin-holding-above-100000-details-here/,"QCP Capital reported in its market assessment published today that Bitcoin has held above the $100,000 level in recent days thanks to optimism about a possible budget deal from the US government. QCP Capital: Bitcoin Holds Above $100,000, Market Supported by Expectations of US Government Deal The company noted that Bitcoin struggled to surpass this level several times but eventually rose to $106,000. It's noteworthy that this rise occurred despite selling pressure from long-term investors (OGs) and fund outflows from spot ETFs. QCP explained that fund flows in the options market were sending mixed signals. While some investors are buying bullish options strategies, signaling optimistic expectations in the market, other investors are selling bullish strategies, reflecting a cautious stance regarding the possibility of Bitcoin breaking new records by the end of the year. The report also highlighted that Bitcoin's ability to absorb OG sales has gained strength similar to past Silk Road and Mt.Gox cycles, suggesting increased market depth and resilience. QCP noted that digital transaction volume (DAT) has decreased but its impact on market sentiment remains decisive.

Glassnode, the renowned on-chain analytics firm, has pinpointed a critical Bitcoin resistance level that could shape the cryptocurrency’s next major move. Their latest analysis reveals $108,500 as the next significant barrier for BTC, based on sophisticated investor behavior patterns. What Makes This Bitcoin Resistance Level So Important? Glassnode’s identification of $108,500 as a key Bitcoin resistance level stems from deep on-chain data analysis. This specific price point represents the average cost basis for the top 15% of Bitcoin investors. Historically, when Bitcoin approaches this threshold during market recoveries, it faces substantial selling pressure. The firm’s research shows that investors who purchased near this price level tend to sell when prices return to their break-even point. This creates a natural Bitcoin resistance level that the market must overcome for continued upward momentum. How Do Resistance Levels Actually Work? Understanding resistance levels requires knowing how investor psychology influences market dynamics. When prices approach key levels where many investors originally entered positions: Investors seek to recover their initial investment Selling pressure increases significantly Market momentum often stalls or reverses Breakthrough requires substantial buying volume The $108,500 Bitcoin resistance level represents one of these critical psychological barriers. Glassnode’s data indicates this isn’t just theoretical – it’s a price point that has repeatedly influenced Bitcoin’s trajectory. Why Should You Care About This Analysis? Glassnode’s identification of this specific Bitcoin resistance level provides valuable insights for both traders and long-term investors. Recognizing these key price zones helps investors make more informed decisions about entry and exit points. Moreover, understanding these resistance levels allows market participants to anticipate potential price movements. When Bitcoin approaches $108,500, traders can watch for signs of either breakthrough or rejection, adjusting their strategies accordingly. What Challenges Does This Resistance Present? Overcoming the $108,500 Bitcoin resistance level requires significant market momentum. Several factors could influence whether Bitcoin breaks through this barrier: Institutional buying pressure Market sentiment shifts Macroeconomic conditions Regulatory developments Each of these elements plays a crucial role in determining whether Bitcoin can successfully surpass this critical Bitcoin resistance level . Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Glassnode’s analysis provides practical guidance for navigating this potential Bitcoin resistance level . Investors should monitor trading volume and price action as Bitcoin approaches $108,500. Increased volume during approach could signal potential breakthrough, while declining volume might indicate rejection. Additionally, watching for consolidation patterns near this level can provide clues about market direction. Successful breakthroughs often involve periods of accumulation just below resistance levels before decisive upward moves. The Bottom Line: What This Means for Bitcoin’s Future Glassnode’s identification of the $108,500 Bitcoin resistance level offers more than just a price target – it provides a framework for understanding market structure. This analysis highlights how investor behavior creates natural price barriers that influence Bitcoin’s journey. While resistance levels don’t guarantee specific outcomes, they represent important psychological and technical markers. The $108,500 level serves as a crucial test for Bitcoin’s strength and could determine whether the cryptocurrency enters new price discovery territory or faces another period of consolidation. Frequently Asked Questions What is a Bitcoin resistance level? A Bitcoin resistance level is a price point where selling pressure typically increases, preventing further price advancement. It represents a psychological barrier where investors often take profits or limit losses. How does Glassnode determine resistance levels? Glassnode uses on-chain data analysis, examining investor cost basis, transaction patterns, and historical price behavior to identify significant resistance levels where concentrated selling typically occurs. Is the $108,500 resistance level guaranteed to hold? No resistance level is guaranteed. While historical data suggests this level has significance, market conditions, volume, and external factors ultimately determine whether resistance holds or breaks. What happens if Bitcoin breaks through this resistance? If Bitcoin successfully breaks through the $108,500 resistance with strong volume, it could signal continued upward momentum and potentially open the path to new all-time highs. How can traders use this information? Traders can watch for price action and volume patterns near this level to make informed decisions about position entries, exits, and risk management strategies. Does this analysis consider market sentiment? Yes, Glassnode’s approach incorporates both quantitative on-chain data and qualitative market sentiment factors that influence investor behavior at key price levels. Found this analysis helpful?

54232251,https://cryptonews.com/?p=449973,1762774100,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/54232251.jpeg,"Bank of England Proposes £20,000 Cap on Stablecoin Holdings",https://cryptonews.com/news/bank-of-england-proposes-20000-cap-on-stablecoin-holdings/,"The Bank of England unveiled proposals for a regulatory regime governing sterling-denominated stablecoins, introducing temporary limits of £20,000 for individuals and £10 million for businesses holding systemic stablecoins. Deputy Governor Sarah Breeden defended the restrictions as necessary to prevent rapid deposit outflows from commercial banks that could threaten credit availability, while promising that the caps would be removed once the transition no longer posed a risk to the UK economy. Deputy Governor of the Bank of England | Source: Reuters Earlier today, a “ Proposed regulatory regime for sterling-denominated systemic stablecoins ” consultation paper was released. The consultation paper marks a significant step toward establishing Britain’s framework for digital assets that pose potential risks to financial stability. While Breeden insisted the UK regime would be operational “ just as quickly as the US ,” industry executives criticized the holding limits as overly cautious compared to America’s approach under the GENIUS Act , which established federal stablecoin regulation without ownership caps. Regulatory Framework Balances Innovation With Stability Concerns The proposed regime applies to systemic stablecoins, those widely used in payments that could impact UK financial stability, and will see joint oversight by the Bank of England for prudential matters and the Financial Conduct Authority for consumer protection. The Bank substantially revised its initial 2023 proposal, now permitting issuers to hold up to 60% of backing assets in short-term UK government debt securities while maintaining at least 40% in unremunerated Bank of England deposits. Capital requirements follow international standards, with issuers needing reserves equal to either the cost of recovery from the largest plausible loss event or six months of operating expenses. Statutory reserves placed on trust for coinholders will cover both financial risk from holding sovereign debt and insolvency costs, ensuring redemption requests are honored by the end of each business day. Industry Backlash Intensifies Over Restrictive Approach The proposed caps have triggered fierce criticism from crypto advocates, who view the measures as counterproductive. “ This proposal only enforces caps on holdings in the more ‘systemic’ stablecoins most likely used for payments ,” Laurence wrote on X. “ It means I will be compelled to move my on-chain funds into something further out the risk curve. It is their safety they are concerned about, not yours. “ Another user, known as Stani.eth, called the approach “ absurd ,” arguing that “ stablecoins issued onchain do not pose greater risks than traditional electronic money issued on more fragile electronic databases. ” Meanwhile, Grant announced his departure from Britain, stating “ i’m leaving the UK this Friday for good. I just don’t trust them to fix it as they’re all highly incompetent and believe taxing their way out of the problem is the only solution. “ stablecoins are a systemic risk to the system, that's the whole point… governments are worried about the debasement of their currencies against the crypto-dollar, and rightly so instead of trying to put the genie back in the bottle, get out in front of it, encourage… https://t.co/idEjStBGrr — Grant (@Grantblocmates) November 10, 2025 Strider labeled the proposal “ draconian ,” warning that “ proposed regulations like this is keeping a cap on the European crypto world. ” Tom Duff Gordon, Vice President of International Policy at Coinbase, has also previously told the Financial Times that “ imposing caps on stablecoins is bad for UK savers, bad for the City and bad for sterling ,” noting no other major jurisdiction deemed such limits necessary. Mortgage Market Differences Drive Cautious Stance Breeden explained that the holding limits stem from fundamental differences between British and American credit markets, where UK consumers obtain mortgages from commercial banks rather than government-sponsored enterprises. “ People in the UK get their mortgages from commercial banks, and so that issue that we talked about, about the need for limits as we transition to a world of stablecoins, is one that is less pertinent to the US regime, ” she said at a London conference on Wednesday. Despite promises that caps remain temporary, the consultation paper provides no timeline for when limits would be lifted. The global stablecoin market has expanded beyond $305 billion, yet sterling-pegged tokens remain negligible at just $1.65M compared to $511 million in euro-linked stablecoins, according to DeFiLlama data .

Amid all the clatter of meme coins and hype, there is one new crypto project that is rising above the rest due to its orderly expansion, accomplishable advancement, and coherent vision that is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Mutuum Finance is now self-positioning on the frontier of decentralized lending, liquidity management, and sustainable tokenomics, which can be the further evolution of blockchain-based finance. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Fundamentally, Mutuum Finance is building both a protocol of lending and borrowing that is centered around transparency and efficiency in a decentralized manner. The project operates under smart contracts without intermediaries making all transactions uninterrupted by human intervention. It is based on its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending protocol. In this case, lenders will tokenize their assets by depositing them in various liquidity pools and minting mtTokens, or tokens that give them yield, or interest. These mtTokens self-accrue interests to the borrowing activity that allow users to earn passive income with minimal effort. As an illustration, when an investor invests ETH via the Mutuum pool, he would be given an equivalent of mtETH, which would appreciate in value as long as borrowers use the funds. When the demand to borrow more funds grows, the yields of the lenders in terms of the annual percentage will get higher. Peer to Peer (P2P) component provides the ability to do custom lending. Borrowers are able to do direct negotiations with the lenders, and decide on the rates and times that they feel comfortable with. Every position is overcollateralized, that is, the borrowers are required to promise in collateral more than they are adding to the system, making the system robust enough to stand even in the times of market turbulence. Transparent Tokenomics The pre-sale at Mutuum Finance is already one of the most successful fundraising events in 2025. The project has already obtained more than $18.55 million, having attracted 17,850 holders and sale of 795 million tokens. The presale is based on the fixed-price, fixed-allocation strategy that mitigates rampant premature concentration and provides extensive community involvement. Out of 4 billion MUTM supply, 45.5% (1.82 billion tokens) gets to be distributed through the presale. In Phase 1, the token was introduced at a price of $0.01 and since then it has gone up to the current price of $0.035 in Phase 6, which is 250% higher than the initial price. When the presale enters the last phase, the launch price will be at 0.06. Approximately Phase 6 is already sold with more than 85 percent indicating the demand is ever-rapid with the project approaching its greatest milestone, the launch of the V1 Testnet. The project also operates a 24-Hour leaderboard to keep the community engaged and to announce the best contributors by offering them prizes each day via MUTM. Security Foundation and V1 Launch The official roadmap of the project states that V1 of the Mutuum Finance will be deployed on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025, which will be an important move into actual development of the project to live testing. The testnet will include basic but essential features (Liquidity Pools), mtTokens, Debt Tokens, and the Liquidator Bot, and supported assets will be ETH and USDT the first. Security is left as one of the focal points in the project. Mutuum Finance managed to pass a CertiK audit with a score of 90/100 Token Scan and has adopted a 50,000 bug bounty to motivate developers to exploit code vulnerabilities before going live on mainnet. According to some market commentators, given that the platform will likely go through with its testnet phase successfully, the token can experience a high level of revaluation. Growth Prospects As large coins such as Solana and Cardano are showing sluggish growth amidst their very high prices, smaller projects are gaining more traction such as Mutuum Finance. According to a number of analysts, the utility-based model proposed by MUTM has the potential to achieve 5x-7x growth after its launch assuming that the adoption will be in line with the forecasts. The structure of the mtToken generates regular on-chain interactions, and the buy-and-distribute system grants the buyer with long-term purchasing force. Under this model, a portion of the fees charged on the platform are used to purchase MUTM tokens available on the open market and this is redistributed to users who stake mtTokens in the safety module. This construction encourages never-ending movement besides rewarding long-term players. Also, on-chain oracles are planned to be used to provide the right price feeds to all collateral assets and this reduces the liquidation risks and helps keep the market stable. These structural mechanics are some of the reasons why Mutuum Finance could be the best cryptocurrencies to watch in the year 2025 to experience long-term growth. When it comes to new crypto-based initiatives, Mutuum Finance is distinguished in 2025 due to its strong growth and focus on functionality. As the presale approaches its close, the V1 testnet approaches and it has plans underway to build the ecosystem long-term, the project has a solid structure to base what might be one of the most rapidly expanding DeFi cryptos in the next five years.

Ex-Public Advisor Exposes ‘Structural Rot’,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/mexc-users-losing-their-crypto/,"Crypto trader the White Whale, who had offered to serve as an advisor to crypto exchange MEXC, has retracted his offer. This came as he highlighted a ‘structural rot’ within the exchange, which puts customers at risk of losing their coins. Crypto Advisor Exposes ‘Structural Rot’ Within MEXC In an X post, the White Whale described the fake proof of reserves, arbitrary justifications for seizures, the lack of due process, and the ability to block users from their own records as the structural rot within the crypto exchange. He further remarked that MEXC remains a “rotten apple” as long as this structural rot exists. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Crypto Market Set To Bounce As Rate Cut Probabilities Touch 98.3% The White Whale revealed that he has withdrawn his offer to advise MEXC, claiming that something “sinister” is brewing. The crypto trader initially offered to advise the crypto exchange for free after he recovered his $3 million from it. However, he is no longer offering his services as he believes everything within the exchange is all “smoke and mirrors.” The crypto trader explained that he had raised concerns about MEXC’s proof of reserves after offering to serve as an advisor to the crypto exchange. He mentioned to the exchange that publishing wallet addresses alone wasn’t sufficient as proof of reserves, and that they had to do more to ensure transparency with users’ funds. The White Whale indicated that MEXC shrugged off this advice, suggesting that what they were doing was better than nothing. However, the crypto trader described the proof of reserves as ‘nothing.’ He added that the exchange continues to push the fake proof-of-reserves narrative, which reminds him of the saying, “If you have to tell people you’re a lady, you aren’t.” On Confiscating Users’ Funds The White Whale mentioned that he told MEXC to stop confiscating users’ funds and that if they suspect illegal activity, they should report it to law enforcement. However, he claimed the exchange is still confiscating users’ funds and that it is getting worse. The crypto trader revealed that a particular user reached out to him with evidence, which he verified. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Could See A New All-Time High Above $126,000 If It Breaks This Critical Level MEXC allegedly cited its Risk Control Guidelines as the reason for confiscating these funds. The White Whale stated that the crypto exchange still used terms like “suspected,” meaning it can permanently confiscate funds based on mere suspicion. He further claimed that the exchange could easily prevent the major items on the list through code, but doing so would remove their excuse to seize user funds. Meanwhile, the White Whale noted that MEXC now wipes users’ transaction history after confiscating their funds. He stated that this happened after he made his account history public to prove his innocence, following the confiscation of $3 million from his account. This move by the crypto exchange now makes it harder for users to prove their innocence.

Hiesboeck claimed that one of the reasons the OG Bitcoin holders are selling their BTC holdings is to repurchase them in the form of ETFs . ETFs offer major tax benefits under current regulations, particularly in the U.S. He emphasized that the sell-off serves as a means of giving covert stashes legitimacy. BTC whales trigger a major sell-off wave According to Hiesboeck, long-term Bitcoin holders have come to realize that blockchain, which is being utilized in every business, is the true revolution, rather than BTC itself. As a result, numerous other initiatives offer higher returns than BTC, which currently has a broad range of use cases. Hiesboeck stated that BTC’s compound annual growth rate (CAGR) has been declining, indicating that it is shifting from being a high-growth asset to being used “as a hedge against traditional financial systems failures and fiat.” Over the past four years, BTC’s CAGR has been slowly dropping. As of November 10, BiTBO estimates that CAGR is approximately 13%. Bitcoin CAGR declines over four years to 13%. Source: BiTBO Dr. Martin Hiesboeck stated that Bitcoin’s maturity is accelerated by the launch of U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs, which attract huge institutional capital, providing less volatility than retail-driven trading. For instance, over the course of one month, SoSoValue data reveal that U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs saw a net inflow of $1.2 billion. The ETFs have a total net asset value of $138.08 billion, with an ETF net asset ratio of 6.67% (market capitalization in relation to the entire BTC market cap). The total historical net inflow is $59.97 billion. According to Lookonchain, Bitcoin whale Owen Gunden transferred 3,600.55 BTC (about $372 million) on November 8. Out of this, 500 BTC, or roughly $51.68 million, has already been placed into Kraken. The remaining 3,100.55 BTC, or roughly $320 million, is anticipated to be sent over the next few days. On September 17, Lookonchain revealed that a long-dormant Bitcoin whale transferred over $116 million worth of the cryptocurrency after a 12-year hiatus, just before the U.S. Federal Reserve’s highly anticipated interest rate decision. The whale had originally purchased the coins for roughly $847 each. According to Lookonchain, the wallet had held $847,000 worth of BTC for more than ten years before transferring it to new wallets on September 17. Dormant BTC Whale Moves $116 Million Worth of BTC After 12 Years. Source: Lookonchain Another Bitcoin whale from the Satoshi era reappeared after 14 years of dormancy, possibly hoping to sell more than $4 billion worth of BTC. According to data from blockchain intelligence platform Nansen, the Satoshi-era Bitcoin whale transferred 40,010 BTC, worth more than $4.6 billion, on July 14 this year. Of this amount, 28,600 BTC were later transferred to Galaxy Digital. On July 15, the remaining 10,200 BTC, valued at $1.2 billion, was transferred to Galaxy Digital, increasing the total amount moved over the previous two days to $4.6 billion. BTC enters new distribution phase amid volatility Earlier last month, macro researcher Jordi Visser proposed that Bitcoin is in its initial product offering phase, with new traders acquiring the tokens and original holders rotating out, expanding distribution. Jordi Visser claims that despite Bitcoin’s sideways movement, there is still confidence in the core value, as evidenced by ETF approvals and the BTC network hashrate reaching all-time highs. In a post on Substack and an episode of businessman Anthony Pompliano’s podcast on Saturday, Visser stated that long-dormant coins are moving, “not all at once.” Not in a panic. However, new investors are gradually entering the market and “accumulating on dips.” Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $106,483.50, up $1,719.60 (1.64%) for the day. The cryptocurrency has shown increasing volatility over the last seven days, ranging from $106,786 to $115,957. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Persistent gains in Solana’s DEX share suggest a structural shift that favors wallets with strong $SOL and cross-chain routing. Best Wallet bakes Fireblocks MPC, a DEX aggregator, and presale access into one app. $BEST’s presale sits near $0.025925, raising over $16.9M with dynamic staking rewards of 77%. Solana had a massive weekend. DEX volume on the network blew past $5B, overtaking Ethereum and BNB. Solana trading volume surged to roughly $5.11B in 24-hour volume, exactly the kind of activity that tends to reset where traders put their money when markets are jumpy. That shift matters for traders as a chain that wins flow usually wins mindshare next. It wasn’t just manic swapping, though. Staking gauges flickered higher too, with data pointing to a 2.9M $SOL increase in stake over the same stretch, nearly $475M at weekend prices, tightening circulating supply. That’s a small but telling signal: risk may be choppy, yet capital isn’t bolting for the exits; it’s retooling on-chain. For a wallet-centric investor, that means user experience (UX) around Solana and cross-chain liquidity isn’t a nice-to-have; it’s an essential. That is where Best Wallet and its token, Best Wallet Token ($BEST) , come into focus. A multi-chain, mobile-first wallet that already integrates Solana and comes complete with a built-in DEX aggregator. Best Wallet and $BEST Builds Solana-First Utility Into a Multi-Chain App Best Wallet’s whitepaper reads like a checklist for this exact moment: It’s non-custodial. It uses Fireblocks MPC security, so you know it’s serious. It has a built-in DEX aggregator (via Rubic) spanning 300+ DEXs and 30 bridges, with explicit Solana support. alongside Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Base, and more. Best Wallet Token’s ($BEST) role isn’t just decoration; it has real utility. You get reduced in-app fees, early access to curated presales through an ‘Upcoming Tokens’ portal, and staking rewards of up to 77%. It’s utility that meets you where you already trade. Let’s face it, we all want life to be simpler, and that includes our finances and trading. By having everything in one place, Best Wallet gives that to you. But sometimes, when things seem too good to be true, it raises red flags. Well, here are two extra points about Best Wallet and $BEST that should give you some extra peace of mind: We clearly know who the issuer is (Best Wallet EOOD, Bulgaria). There is a Coinsult audit of the $BEST smart contract. Having a clear issuer and a third-party audit doesn’t eliminate risk, but it definitely sets a good baseline for a token connected to a live app. For anyone tracking where smart money is moving, that’s a credible starting point. Want in on the Best Wallet ecosystem? We’ve got you covered in our ‘ How to Buy Best Wallet Token ’ guide. Presale Math and Incentives: Over $16.9M Raised, Dynamic Staking Around the High-70s The $BEST presale is doing well because it has a compelling story and strong mechanics. Right now, $BEST has raised over $16.9M, showing strong investor and retail support. Holders get access to innovations from the Best Wallet ecosystem. The upcoming Best Card, for example, will enable you to spend your crypto anywhere that accepts Mastercard, and get cashback too! As for staking, 8% of the total supply is set aside for these rewards. These high APYs are an incentive to get you in early, but the key is that they get you to use the product, getting those fee reductions, early token allocations, and generally driving on-chain activity. The token setup is simple: $BEST is an ERC-20 token with a 10B supply, and the allocations are public. The presale process is super easy: buy in-app or on the site, you can stake right away, and claim tokens at the end. If Solana’s market share keeps climbing, a wallet token that benefits from both $SOL usage and easy cross-chain swaps is in a very sweet spot. Our experts predict that $BEST could reach $0.072 by the end of 2025 , giving you a potential return of 177%. Join the $BEST presale today for $0.025925. Remember, this is not intended as financial advice, and you should always do your own research before making any investments.

Can Bitcoin go higher, or are we about to see a rejection from the current position? Back to retest the trendline or horizontal support? Source: TradingView It’s all pretty much in the chart as to what probably happens next. It can be seen in the 4-hour chart above that the $BTC price took a quick turn back to the upside on Sunday when it perhaps looked more likely that the price was going back to the $100,000 horizontal support level for another retest. Instead, the price rose steadily through Sunday before breaking out of the downtrend line at the end of the day. Monday morning has seen the price rise to the $106,000 horizontal level where it is currently struggling and looking likely to reject from here. The Stochastic RSI indicators are just starting to roll over and back down, so the likelihood is that the $BTC price could either retest the descending trendline as support, or break through, or follow it down to the major $100,000 support level. If the bulls do manage to push the price higher from here, it just becomes further overbought and the reckoning with the bears will just have to take place a bit higher up - possibly at $110,000. Retest of 15-month trendline before major rally? Source: TradingView On the daily chart one can just about see the little trend break that is currently taking place. At the bottom of the chart, the RSI indicator has also just broken through a downtrend, suggesting that there may be more longevity in this move. However, in the bigger picture this is just a bit more noise. The $BTC price would still be expected to come down that little bit further in order to make a retest of the major ascending trendline. Once that has occurred, all the boxes would then probably be ticked and a proper strong rally could then kick off. Hash Ribbons indicator signals something big is coming Source: TradingView The above weekly chart for $BTC shows the entirety of the bull market so far. A rough trendline has been drawn in order to show that three big upside price waves have taken place. It could be contended that another big price wave exists right at the beginning of the bull market, but we are generally trying to show the waves on an ascending trendline. The vertical green dotted lines in the chart show the Hash Ribbons buy signals. These buy signals are quite rare in the weekly time frame, and it can be seen that they roughly correspond to the end of one wave and the beginning of the next. The Hash ribbons indicator tracks the network hashrate, and triggers a buy signal when Bitcoin miners capitulate, causing the hashrate to drop sharply because of unprofitably mining. This normally combines with a low price and a beginning of network recovery, which normally leads to a rally in price. An anomaly in the chart reveals that instead of 1 or 2 buy signals in a year, 2025 has received 3 buy signals, which has never before happened in such close proximity. The significance here is that miners have restarted mining not once, but three times, suggesting an accelerated hashrate rebound, therefore a deeper capitulation, but followed by a shallower recovery time. Is another big price wave about to form? Wouldn’t this take the price beyond the 8-year ascending trendline, and in its turn cause a huge explosive rally to the upside?

The BoE's proposal aims to prevent individual investors from taking excessive risks as stablecoins become more widely used as payment instruments in the country. In addition, reserve rules have been set for stablecoin issuers that will be placed under the new BoE supervision after being audited by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Accordingly, a maximum of 95% of the reserve assets of such stablecoins will be allowed to be invested in short-term government bonds. Officials stated that these regulations would both increase user trust and ensure the seamless integration of stablecoins into the UK financial system.

Among recent launches, Remittix (RTX) has rapidly outperformed both DigiTap ($TAP) and BlockDAG, emerging as one of the strongest blockchain projects this year. The project’s growing popularity stems from its focus on practical crypto payments connecting digital assets directly to traditional finance. Having raised over $28 million in private funding, Remittix’s expansion signals increasing investor trust and a clear move toward mainstream crypto adoption. DigiTap’s Functional Approach To Digital Banking The foundation of DigiTap’s digital banking strategy is the $TAP token, around which the company is still developing its ecosystem. $TAP, which is priced at 0.0297 USDT, supports the platform’s premium user advantages, cashback incentives, and staking. Its emphasis on combining decentralized access with banking characteristics has drawn more attention, particularly as the market moves toward DeFi initiatives that incorporate conventional financial components. DigiTap must, however, quicken adoption and enhance on-chain interaction to sustain growing momentum in the face of competition from up-and-coming cryptocurrencies like Remittix. BlockDAG’s Slow But Steady Build BlockDAG, priced at $0.005, continues to attract developers for its efficient blockDAG-based infrastructure. Its design aims to enhance scalability and reduce confirmation times, a key feature for low gas fee crypto solutions. Although it has established a loyal developer base, analysts believe its slower community expansion has limited short-term visibility compared to high-growth crypto projects like Remittix, which combine utility, accessibility and user rewards. Remittix Outshines As The Leading ICO Of 2025 At the center of attention, Remittix priced at $0.1166 per token has quickly gained recognition as one of the best DeFi projects of 2025. Built around the PayFi concept, it allows users to send crypto directly to bank accounts in over 30 countries. With $28.1 million+ raised through private funding and more than 684.6 million tokens sold, Remittix is bridging a real gap in global payments. The project’s CertiK verification, where it ranks #1 among pre-launch tokens, reinforces its credibility. The Remittix Wallet Beta is expanding to more iOS users, marking a major step toward mainstream usability. In addition, its referral program on Remittix lets holders earn 15% USDT rewards for community growth further boosting engagement. Why Remittix Is Dominating 2025 Verified by CertiK — ranked #1 among pre-launch tokens $28.1M+ raised from private funding Real utility: crypto-to-bank payments in 30+ countries Expanding Wallet Beta for community testers Active $250,000 Giveaway for RTX holders Remittix’s development momentum continues with future listings on BitMart and LBank already confirmed. The project has also introduced a 50% Token Bonus for a limited time, using promo code RTX50, as it nears the $30 million milestone a move designed to reward early ecosystem supporters. The Token That’s Redefining Value While DigiTap focuses on digital banking and BlockDAG strengthens blockchain infrastructure, Remittix is achieving what many projects only aim for real-world adoption. With private funding secured, strong utility and verified credibility, Remittix stands out as a next 100x crypto contender and arguably the best ICO of 2025 for those looking to buy into blockchain projects with tangible purpose and fast-growing global reach.

Bitcoin soared from above $101,000 to surpass $106,000 as the cryptocurrency market cap reclaimed $3.58 trillion after an over 4% increase in the past 24 hours. Altcoins recorded notable uptick as they mirrored enhanced broader sentiments. Meanwhile, HUMA’s 6.4% uptick coincided with the appointment of Jessica Cao to lead Huma Finance’s Asia-Pacific operations, according to a local source . With over 17 years of leadership at Standard Chartered, Citigroup, and Ant International, Cao will fuel the PayFi project’s growth, product evolution, and partnerships across the Asia Pacific region as CEO. Commenting on the strategic move, Jessica Cao emphasised Huma Finance’s long-term goals, stating: The Asia-Pacific region provides unique opportunities to connect traditional finance with emerging blockchain infrastructure. Huma’s vision goes beyond payment finance to unlock liquidity and provide efficient solutions to businesses across the region. Meanwhile, Cao’s appointment comes ahead of this week’s (November 12 to 14) Singapore Fintech Festival, which celebrates ten years of financial innovation. Huma Finance is a PayFi platform aiming to democratise the global payment industry with instant liquidity. Under the new APAC CEO, the project plans to accelerate the adoption of its PayFi solutions by promoting financial inclusion through DeFi and TradFi. A milestone for digital payments Huma Finance’s strategic expansion into APAC marks a new era for the PayFi platform, reflecting increasing integration between decentralized systems and traditional finance. Huma Finance is now combining leadership experience, stablecoin liquidity, and tokenized assets to shape cross-border finance with inclusivity, cost-efficiency, and speed. As the Asia-Pacific region embraces blockchain, Huma Finance’s focus indicates how on-chain capital can revolutionise real-world economic activities with instant liquidity access and financial inclusion. With Jessica Cao as CEO, Huma Finance looks to cement its status as a primary player in the vibrant APAC by merging blockchain with traditional finance. HUMA price outlook The altcoin maintained a bullish outlook today, trading at $0.02397. The digital asset looks to extend the gains as Bitcoin targets $110,000 . Chart by CoinMarketCap However, HUMA requires amplified trading volumes to support its recovery in the near term. Technical indicators also suggest feeble momentum. Huma Finance’s token is trading below the 50 and 100 Exponential Moving Averages on the 24-hour chart. The Relative Strength Index at 44 hints at seller preference. Nonetheless, the emerging green histograms and bullish crossover by the Moving Average Convergence Divergence signals potential reversals. Meanwhile, broader sentiments will shape HUMA’s performance in the coming sessions. Continued rallies could see the altcoin reclaiming early October levels above $0.03700. On the other hand, overall market struggles will likely erase HUMA’s latest gains.

Nearly all of the top 100 coins have risen over the past 24 hours. At the same time, the total crypto trading volume is at $136 billion. TLDR: The crypto market capitalisation is up by 2.6% on Monday morning (UTC); 99 of the top 100 coins and all of the top 10 coins are up today; BTC increased by 4.3% to $106,253, and ETH rose by 5.7% to $3,606; The US Senate advanced a deal on Sunday to reopen the federal government; Realized losses suggest capitulation among recent BTC buyers; ’Don’t expect a quick unidirectional move lower in BTC’; We will see the low in the $71,000 to $84,000 region reached sometime towards the second half of 2026; Both US BTC and ETH spot ETFs saw outflows on Friday, with $558.44 million and $46.62 million, respectively; The US Labor Department didn’t publish its employment report for a second straight month due to the government shutdown; Crypto market sentiment remains firmly in the fear territory. Crypto Winners & Losers At the time of writing, all of the top 10 coins per market capitalization have seen their prices increase over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC) has appreciated by 4.3% since this time yesterday, currently trading at $106,253. Bitcoin (BTC) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Ethereum (ETH) is up by 5.7%, now changing hands at $3,606. This is the second-highest increase in the category. The highest rise in the category is 8.7% by XRP , now trading at $2.48. Among these, Tron (TRX) saw the smallest increase, recording a 1.3% rise to the price of $0.2936. Looking at the top 100 coins, three saw double-digit rises. Pump.fun (PUMP) is up 15.4% to $0.004402, followed by Zcash (ZEC)’s 15.3% to $662.97. The third one is Uniswap (UNI) , which saw an increase of 14.3%, now standing at $6.74. On the other hand, Internet Computer (ICP) is the only red coin, having dropped 9.8% to $7.14. Meanwhile, the US Senate advanced a deal on Sunday to reopen the federal government, funding operations through 30 January 2026. The shutdown has had its influence on the crypto market as it tightened liquidity and increased volatility. Therefore, a resolution would be beneficial for the markets across the board, but any issues could prolong the volatility. BTC May Drop to $70K-$80K in Q2 2026 John Glover, Chief Investment Officer of Ledn , argued that “BTC prices continue to come softer as expected.” That said, he highlights that there is typically “a fair bit of volatility” as tops or bottoms form. Therefore, he says, “don’t expect a quick unidirectional move lower in BTC.” Glover expects that we will see the low in the $71,000 to $84,000 region reached sometime towards the second half of 2026 (the yellow line in the chart below). Source: Ledn One of the key 4 th wave targets is the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement, which sits at $99,000, he continues. “We have yet to close below that level, so this is where I expect the first bounce.” “While some feel strongly that the 23.6% support will hold, I expect Wave IV to be quite complex, with lots of rallies and sell-offs, eventually hitting the 50% to 38.2% retracement levels ($71k and $84k respectively),” Glover concluded. Moreover, according to Glassnode analysts, realized losses suggest capitulation among recent BTC buyers. I'm keeping my eye on Spot & Futures Volume and ETF inflows to see if the demand side is ready to step in here. — Chris Beamish (@ChrisBeamish_) November 10, 2025 Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing on Monday morning, BTC trades at $106,253. The charts show a clear and gradual increase from the intraday low of $101,546 to the intraday high of $106,488. While green on the daily front, the coin is red in the weekly and monthly timeframes. It’s down 1.4% over the past 7 days and 4.9% over the last 30 days. It’s also 16% below its all-time high of $126,080 seen a month ago. Sustaining the price above $106,000 could see BTC move over $110,000. This would open doors for further rallies. On the other hand, falling below $103,200 may lead to the $100,000 level and a decline toward the $98,000-$95,000 zone. Ethereum is currently changing hands at $3,606. Like BTC, ETH recorded a notable increase from the day’s low of $3,384 to the high of $3,647. It hasn’t corrected much since. Over the past week, the price moved between $3,162 and $3,727. Overall, the coin is down 3.2% in a week and 6% in a month. Also, it’s 27.4% away from the August ATH of $4,946. The current key resistance zones stand at $3,783, $4,231, and $4,549. A break above $3,800 could result in a bullish move toward $4,200 and higher. But a failure to hold above $3,300 may lead the coin to retest the support levels around $3,050. Meanwhile, Ethereum network fees have plunged to some of their lowest levels in years . Ethereum (ETH) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Moreover, the crypto market sentiment has stayed within the fear zone since the beginning of this month. The crypto fear and greed index stands at 24 today , somewhat higher than Friday’s 21, but still relatively close to the ‘extreme fear’ level. Except for the first third of October, the rest of that month and the first ten days of November have been spent in the neutral and the fear zones. It is clear that fear is leading the market and pulling the prices down. Investors selling their crypto can lead to higher selling pressure and volatility. That said, it’s also creating buying opportunities for the hodlers. ETFs Return to Negative Flows The US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) resumed the red performance, following a single day of inflows. On Friday, it recorded $558.44 million in outflows, a level similar to Tuesday’s. The total net inflow fell to $59.97 billion. Five of the 12 ETFs saw outflows. There were no inflows. Fidelity is at the top of the red list with $256.66 million, followed by Ark&21Shares’ $144.24 million and BlackRock’s $131.43 million. Same as the BTC ETFs, the US ETH ETFs saw one day of positive flows on Thursday, breaking an outflow streak, but it turned back to red on Friday with $46.62 million in inflows. The total net inflow now stands at $13.86 billion. Unlike BTC ETFs, two of the nine funds saw positive flows, and two saw outflows. BlackRock and Invesco took in $34.43 million and $2.59 million, respectively. At the same time, Fidelity and Grayscale let go of $72.23 million and $11.42 million, respectively. Meanwhile, the US spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded a net outflow of $1.22 billion in the past week – the third-largest ever recorded. This follows ongoing market volatility and macroeconomic pressures. From November 3 to November 7 (ET), spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a weekly net outflow of $1.22 billion, the third-largest on record. Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded a weekly net outflow of $508 million, also the third-largest in history.

The crypto market has increased over the past day, and the stock market saw a mixed picture during work hours on Friday. By the closing time on 7 November, the S&P 500 was up by 0.13%, the Nasdaq-100 decreased by 0.28%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 0.16%. The US government shutdown continues to affect the markets. The October jobs report didn’t go out on Friday again. This data is useful to investors who are looking for signals on the Federal Reserve’s next interest rates move. Is this rally sustainable? The US Senate advanced a deal on Sunday to reopen the federal government. Investors are now keeping a close eye on the developments, as successful reopening would ease the volatility and benefit the crypto marker overall.

These presales don’t just offer discounts but a chance to back ecosystems before they debut on major exchanges. Among the many names, some projects are setting themselves apart with working infrastructure, large fundraising milestones, or viral-driven hype. This article explores four of the most talked-about presale crypto coins: BlockDAG, Nexchain, Bitcoin Hyper, and Little Pepe. Each brings a different approach to blockchain and crypto adoption, ranging from high-performance networks and utility mining rigs to AI integration and meme-powered communities. Let’s break down what makes them worth watching. 1. BlockDAG: Tech, Trust, & Over $435M Raised BlockDAG (BDAG) is one of the biggest presale crypto coins of this cycle, raising over $435 million and gaining 312,000+ holders. Its technology combines Bitcoin-style Proof-of-Work security with a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure, allowing 2,000–15,000 transactions per second. The live Awakening Testnet already processes over 1,400 TPS with full EVM compatibility, showing it’s not just a whitepaper concept. This hybrid design solves scalability limits without compromising decentralization or security; two issues many chains struggle with. What truly separates BlockDAG from other presale crypto coins is its transparent leadership. CEO Antony Turner brings 30 years of Fintech experience, while CTO Jeremy Harkness and advisor Dr. Maurice Herlihy bring academic and engineering credibility. The platform has completed security audits from CertiK and Halborn, and over 20,000 X-series miners (X10, X30, X100) have already been sold, giving users a way to earn BDAG before mainnet launch. BlockDAG recently shifted into its “Value Era,” where it ends all bonuses and incentives to build long-term stability. The presale officially closes on February 10, 2026, or when supply sells out. Coins in Batch 32 are currently priced at $0.005, with a target listing price of $0.05. With real infrastructure, active mining adoption, and institutional-scale funding, BlockDAG remains the front-runner among presale crypto coins. 2. Nexchain: The AI-Powered Layer 1 Nexchain is positioning itself as an AI-optimized Layer 1 network using a mix of Proof-of-Stake and DAG architecture. The team claims processing speeds of up to 400,000 TPS and ultra-low fees around $0.001 per transaction. Its presale is currently in Stage 27, selling tokens at around $0.108 with a projected listing price close to $0.30. So far, Nexchain has raised over $10 million, showing strong early traction. Its ecosystem plans include AI-integrated smart contracts, developer SDKs, and cross-chain support. While ambitious, the project is still in presale and yet to prove live performance, meaning execution matters from here on. Still, its tech narrative and growth pace keep it in the conversation. 3. Bitcoin Hyper: Extending Utility Beyond Bitcoin Bitcoin Hyper is marketed as a project built to enhance the Bitcoin ecosystem rather than compete with it. As of early November 2025, the presale has crossed $25.5 million, attracting investors who believe in Bitcoin but want more scalable applications and token-based utility. Some listing platforms show an early trading price around $0.000027, though liquidity remains thin at this stage. Its appeal lies in its narrative; bringing smart contract utility and scalability to Bitcoin-inspired infrastructure. However, many technical details are still limited, and adoption will depend on whether it can deliver real-world use cases. That said, among presale crypto coins, it stands out due to strong branding and community-driven enthusiasm. 4. Little Pepe: Meme Hype With Real Utility Plans Little Pepe takes a meme-first approach but claims to add real usage by launching on a Layer-2 EVM-compatible network. The presale has raised over $27.4 million, selling more than 16.6 billion tokens out of its 100 billion supply. Current presale pricing sits around $0.0022, with expectations of listing near $0.0030. Unlike many meme coins, Little Pepe outlines utility components like zero trading tax, anti-bot protections, and future staking functions. Its success depends on whether it can maintain hype beyond its launch and actually deliver on its technical promises. Still, it’s one of the fastest-selling presale crypto coins in the meme category. Final Take Presales come with high potential and high risk, but they also offer early access to projects shaping future market conversations. Presale crypto coins like BlockDAG, Nexchain, Bitcoin Hyper, and Little Pepe each target different audiences, whether it’s hardcore tech believers, meme communities, AI innovators, or Bitcoin purists. Among them, BlockDAG stands out due to its working Testnet, strong leadership, audited code, and massive community funding above $435 million. Nexchain appeals to those focused on AI scaling, Bitcoin Hyper to Bitcoin loyalists looking for utility, and Little Pepe to meme culture with added structure. As always, these are speculative and require proper research, but they highlight where early interest is shifting in the presale crypto coins space.

Institutional flows remain sticky, with IBIT’s rapid AUM ascent reinforcing the ‘allocators aren’t leaving’ narrative during macro turbulence. In sideways majors, capital is watching utility-first plays where tokens power real-world activity (content, payments, or AI), and not just emissions. SUBBD Token is a project that tokenizes content in the first AI agent creator platform that uses blockchain technology. The presale has currently raised over $1.3M. Bitcoin’s cooled off after ripping to six figures, and macro noise from Washington’s prolonged shutdown hasn’t helped risk appetite. Yet the world’s largest asset manager (BlackRock) isn’t blinking. Instead, it frames Bitcoin as a long-duration , structural bet anchored by network adoption, deeper liquidity, and the slow erosion of legacy money systems. That’s not the tone you hear during a flash dump, but the pitch you use when you’re allocating for years to come, not weeks. And flows back it up. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT ) became the fastest U.S. ETF to surpass roughly $80B in assets and has since solidified its position at the top of the spot $BTC ETF stack. Translation: despite choppier price action, institutions are still dollar-cost-averaging Bitcoin via regulated rails. And with the U.S. shutdown now trudging toward a resolution , the policy overhang looks more like a speed bump than a trend shift. And over a week ago, BlackRock’s IBIT surpassed Coinbase’s Deribit platform and became the largest Bitcoin options venue in the world. For traders watching risk rotations, that matters. When majors grind sideways but the strategic case remains intact, capital looks at early-stage projects with promising utility. We’re talking about a bid on the best altcoins , and that’s where SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) is trying to earn attention: a content-and-AI play that leans into tokenization and the creator commerce industry, with fan engagement mechanics. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD): AI-Powered Creator Monetization & Access SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) isn’t just another presale pitch; it’s a creator toolkit built to do real work. The platform integrates AI assistants, voice cloning, and automated livestreaming into a single workflow, allowing you to script, produce, and publish with fewer tabs and fewer late nights. Fans receive clean, token-gated access to premium drops and livestreams, while you set flexible pricing, bundles, and perks that align with how your audience engages. On-platform mechanics keep the loop tight. Discounts on subscriptions, tipping, and pay-per-view unlocks let you experiment with revenue without rebuilding your stack. Engagement feeds XP multipliers slot into raffles and simple games, turning passive viewers into committed members. You spend less time juggling calendars and more time shipping content: the AI helpers handle repetitive admin, so a larger share of each subscriber dollar lands where it should. The payoff is practical: faster production cycles, smoother paywalls, and stickier communities that come back for access, not hype. In a market tired of promises, a platform that saves time and deepens fan relationships is the utility that travels in any cycle. Plus, there’s a lot to look forward to, like strategic partnerships for marketing, enhanced AI image generation, the HoneyHive, and the release of the Creators mobile app. In a market that’s increasingly allergic to vapor, this is the kind of utility-first framing that can still resonate even when $BTC cools off. Visit the $SUBBD presale page to join ahead of time. Presale Is Burning Red-Hot with $1.3M Raised & 20% Staking APY Presales live or die on incentives and clarity. In $SUBBD’s case, transparency is evident – over $1.3M has been raised so far, with the current stage pricing at $0.0569. Staking is another hook: tokens staked during the sale earn a fixed 20% APY for the first year per the whitepaper, shifting to platform-benefit staking thereafter. That’s high, but as always, view it as an early-stage incentive to bootstrap participation rather than a permanent yield regime. To join the presale, follow our $SUBBD buying guide or visit the official presale page and follow the steps there. The presale accepts $USDT, $BNB, $ETH, $USDC, and fiat via a debit card. If BlackRock’s steady-hand view maintains a constructive backdrop while $BTC fluctuates, presales with immediate product hooks, such as $SUBBD, have a cleaner path to narrative alignment. Grab your $SUBBD now. This article is informational only, not financial advice. Presales are high-risk; tokens may be illiquid and their values are volatile. Do your own research.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/first-u-s-spot-xrp-etfs-could-launch-next-week-heres-why/,"The cryptocurrency market is on the verge of a pivotal moment. The launch of the first U.S.-listed spot XRP ETFs could happen next week , marking a significant milestone in traditional finance’s adoption of this major altcoin. What the DTCC Listing Reveals According to Coin Bureau’s post on X, the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) recently listed five spot XRP ETFs under its “active and pre-launch” category — specifically vehicles from Bitwise Asset Management, Franklin Templeton Investments , 21Shares, Canary Capital, and CoinShares. Inclusion in DTCC’s active/pre-launch registry indicates that operational readiness steps — such as custody arrangements and settlement processing — are in place for these funds. That said, this listing does not amount to formal regulatory approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Approval remains the final gatekeeper. BREAKING: The first U.S. spot #XRP ETFs could launch next week. The DTCC just listed five spot XRP ETFS from Bitwise, Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, Canary, and CoinShares under its ""active and pre-launch"" category. pic.twitter.com/h1HQRpaEsm — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) November 10, 2025 Regulatory and Market Context The broader regulatory landscape dramatically shifted on September 18, 2025, when the SEC approved rule changes allowing national exchanges to adopt generic listing standards for certain spot crypto ETFs — thereby drastically reducing the time and complexity required for listing. With the launch of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs now behind us, issuers are keen to replicate that window of opportunity with other large-market-cap tokens such as XRP. The firms’ coordinated filing amendments indicate they’re preparing for a launch. Why This Matters for XRP and the Market If one or more of these spot XRP ETFs begin trading next week, institutional access to XRP could broaden significantly. ETFs offer a regulated, familiar pathway for capital flow into underlying crypto assets, which may enhance liquidity, narrow spreads, and bring new investor classes into the fold. The anticipation of the launch has already boosted XRP’s price and trading volume. For instance, XRP rose more than 8% in a session as ETF expectations mounted. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Moreover, a successful launch could pave the way for further altcoin ETFs and accelerate the integration of crypto into mainstream asset portfolios. Risks & Timing Considerations Despite the optimism, investors must remain mindful of caveats. Listing on the DTCC does not equal SEC approval. Final regulatory sign-off could still face delays or require additional disclosures. Additionally, the magnitude and timing of fund inflows will depend heavily on issuer market-making infrastructure and investor demand, which can be unpredictable. Given these factors, market watchers will be looking for formal exchange notices announcing ticker symbols, launch dates, and trading venues — these are the final stepping stones before live trading begins. Outlook All signs currently point toward a launch window in mid-November, possibly as early as next week. If approved, the first wave of U.S. spot XRP ETFs may go live shortly, marking a notable milestone for the token and the broader digital-asset ecosystem. For crypto journalists, academics, and traders alike, this development merits close attention. Disclaimer: This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Nonetheless, Bitcoin and Ethereum have recouped their recent losses. Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds recorded outflows worth $558.44 million on Friday last week, bringing the week’s total outflows to $1.2 billion. According to data from ETF tracking platform SosoValue, Fidelity (FBTC) led the firms with negative flows worth $256 million, while Ark & 21Shares (ARKB) followed with $144.24 million. BlackRock’s iBIT sees $131.43 million in net outflows iShares Bitcoin Trust(IBIT) 1D net inflow. Source: SosoValue BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF came in third with $131.43 million, while Grayscale’s GBTC and Bitwise’s BITB registered outflows worth $15.44 million and $10.68 million, respectively. Grayscale (BTC), VanEck (HODL), Invesco (BTCO), Valkyrie (BRRR), Franklin (EZBC), Wisdom Tree (BTCW), and Hashdex did not record any flows on Friday. Similarly, data from Sosovalue also shows that Ethereum ETFs registered negative flows last week. The firms recorded outflows worth $46.62 million on Friday, bringing their net outflows for the week to a little over half a billion. In contrast, Solana ETFs outperformed Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs last week. The data shows that the ETFs have had a streak of positive flows since their inception on October 28. On Friday, the ETFs recorded inflows worth $12.69 million, bringing the total inflows for the week to $136.5 million. The prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum have sharply recovered and reversed recent losses brought on by macroeconomic uncertainties, despite the poor flows of spot ETFs. According to crypto price tracking platform CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin is up 4% in the last 24 hours, shedding its seven-day loss to 1.48%. The crypto asset is currently exchanging hands for $106,371.49. On the other hand, Ethereum is up 4.92% in the last 24 hours and down 3.47% in the last 7 days. The crypto asset is currently trading at $3,607. Solana has surged by 5.05% in the last 24 hours, reducing its seven-day losses to 4.62%. SOL’s current market price is $167.69, and the crypto asset holds the sixth position among the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Wall Street’s growing interest in crypto continues Despite the recent performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, Wall Street continues to show significant interest in the crypto ecosystem. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF continues to lead inflows this year with $82.28 billion in net assets under management. FBTC follows IBIT with $20.71 billion in net assets, while GBTC trails closely behind with $17.72 billion in net assets. The firms now cumulatively hold $138.08 billion in net assets under management. Fidelity and VanEck have also expanded their spot product lines, while Bitwise and Grayscale pioneered Solana ETFs in late October. These ETFs have experienced a surge in demand since their inception, attracting nearly $70 million on the first day of trading. The firms have drawn a little over half a billion dollars from investors at the time of this publication, according to SosoValue. Spot XRP ETFs set to launch in the US this month Five spot XRP ETFs from Canary Capital, CoinShares, 21Shares, Franklin Templeton, and Bitwise also recently appeared on DTCC’s list, which was last updated on Friday. Cryptopolitan recently reported that the ETFs are expected to hit the U.S. market by the end of November and will include both active and pre-launch ETFs. Nate Geraci, co-founder and President of Nova Dius Wealth, said that the end of the government shutdown paves the way for an imminent surge in spot crypto ETFs.

STRK is showing signs of notable growth. XRP is surrounded by anticipation and speculation. ICP is making a notable comeback. Each of these digital assets is carving its unique path. How are these stories shaping up and what might they signal for future trends? Delve in to discover more. Starknet Price Soars, Eyes Further Gains Amid Growing Interest Source: tradingview Starknet (STRK) is currently trading between 11 and 17 cents, catching attention with its recent price surge. Over the past week, it jumped more than 70%, and in the last month, it's up over 80%. The coin is riding high, supported by strong momentum. A key level to watch is 20 cents, which is its nearest resistance. If Starknet breaks through, it could aim for the 26-cent mark, marking over 50% growth from its current range. The coin's RSI points to growing interest, while its moving averages hint at potential upward movement. As more eyes turn to Starknet, its journey might just be getting started. XRP Eyes Growth Beyond Resistance as Investors Watch Closely Source: tradingview XRP is currently trading between $2.11 and $2.58, showing signs of potential upward movement. Its nearest resistance level is $2.79, just a small jump from its current range, suggesting a possible rise of over ten percent. If momentum continues, it might hit the second resistance at $3.25, which would be a significant increase in value. However, the relative strength index is high at 84.04, hinting at a possible overbought condition. Despite this, with a monthly growth of nearly 8 percent, optimism remains. Recently, the coin has shown positive movement with a modest week-long change, sparking interest among investors who hope for a continued climb. Internet Computer (ICP) Sees Robust Growth: Potential Ahead Source: tradingview Internet Computer (ICP) has been on a notable upward trend. Recently, it showed a one-week price jump of almost 65% and an impressive 133% surge over the month. Trading between a range of just over $4 to nearly $10, ICP is currently below its nearest resistance level, which stands at over $13. If the momentum continues, it could see growth up to the next resistance level at roughly $19, presenting potential gains of approximately 90%. Despite some recent volatility, the coin appears poised for more growth, as technical indicators point to its potential to climb further. With careful watch on support and resistance levels, traders are observing its promising trajectory. Conclusion The market cycle highlights varied stories for STRK, XRP, and ICP. STRK shows impressive growth, driven by innovation and increasing interest. XRP garners anticipation due to ongoing legal developments and potential mainstream adoption. ICP experiences a resurgence as it works to redefine Internet structure and attract developers. Together, these cryptocurrencies exemplify the dynamic nature and diverse opportunities present in the market. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

This follows the recent addition of five XRP ETFs to the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation’s (DTCC) active roster. DTCC Listing Brings Spot XRP ETFs Closer to Launch The DTCC inclusion confirms that the clearing and settlement systems are ready for these investment products. The database is a centralized system that records and processes securities transactions, including ETFs, in the United States financial markets. However, the development is not an approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) but is widely seen as one of the final steps before launch. The listed funds include the Bitwise XRP ETF (XRP), Franklin Templeton XRP Trust (XRPZ), 21Shares XRP ETF (TOXR), Canary Capital XRP ETF (XRPC), and CoinShares XRP ETF (XRPL). The timing of these additions coincides with the resolution of the U.S. government shutdown, which had previously stalled regulatory processes. Following the Senate’s approval of a bipartisan funding package, agencies like the SEC can now resume normal operations. This allows for the review of all new financial products, including ETFs, to move forward. Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, commented on the development, stating, “Government shutdown ending = spot crypto ETF floodgates opening,” adding that he expects the spot XRP ETFs to go live this week. The analyst also believes that these developments show a clear shift in regulatory tone, following the end of Ripple’s five-year legal dispute with the SEC in August 2025. Amended S-1 Filings Pave the Way for Immediate Release Several issuers have recently submitted amended S-1 registration statements with the financial watchdog, with some removing the “delaying amendment” clause and adding “automatic effectiveness” language. This change allows their ETFs to launch immediately once given the green light. Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg said last week that the firm could launch its XRPC ETF as early as next week. Franklin Templeton and 21Shares have also lodged third amendments, with both removing Section 8(a) delay language to speed up approval. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted that the 21Shares filing starts a 20-day waiting period, potentially setting its debut within November if no further holdups occur. Bitwise has also updated its registration for a spot XRP ETF, with Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan commenting that these funds could “easily become” billion-dollar investment vehicles within their first few months of trading, citing strong institutional interest and the success of Solana and Bitcoin spot ETFs as examples.

The chart, which tracks XRP’s performance against the U.S. dollar from 2013, highlights several recurring support zones that have previously served as the foundation for sustained rallies. These include $0.5, $0.175, and a lower long-term level around $0.005, all of which align with major turning points in XRP’s historical price structure. Sistine Research noted that XRP will keep defending the $2 level until the time comes to climb toward $10 , adding that the price is not expected to “spend meaningful time under $2.” This view places the current consolidation above $2 in a potentially pivotal position, similar to prior extended accumulation periods seen before earlier bull market expansions. XRP probably just defends $2 monthly level until its time to run to $10. Could be tomorrow, could be in 6 months, but not expecting price to spend meaningful time under $2. pic.twitter.com/ctEkzf4BSc — Sistine Research (@sistineresearch) November 8, 2025 Price Behavior and Technical Overview The monthly chart shows that XRP has rebounded repeatedly from deep correction phases, each time setting higher long-term lows marked by green arrows. The latest series of these arrows around the $2 region indicates renewed buying interest after a strong advance between late 2024 and early 2025. Historically, XRP’s sharp recoveries have often followed these compression zones. The technical layout suggests that the $2 region is more than a psychological barrier, as XRP has reclaimed it swiftly after every dip since its decisive rise above this level in early 2025. Confirmed monthly closes above this zone could reinforce the foundation for a potential breakout toward higher levels, particularly if momentum persists through early 2026. Timelines for XRP $10 Target While short-term volatility remains part of XRP’s trading environment, the broader monthly view signals structural strength. The asset’s past reactions to its major levels demonstrate a repeating pattern of consolidation, defense, and expansion. From a technical perspective, defending $2 effectively positions XRP for a move toward $3, with a potential extension toward the previously cited $10 target under favorable conditions.

54233419,624794,1762777106,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54233419.jpeg,Monero Jumps Over 20% This Week as Privacy Narrative Reignites; Why Best Wallet Token Is Riding the Wave,https://bitcoinist.com/monero-privacy-rally-best-wallet-token-presale-16-9m/,"Quick Facts: Monero’s surge – about 20% – reignites the privacy narrative, with shorts squeezed and an upgrade pipeline adding fundamental support. Its recent Fluorine Fermi update, along with the upcoming Full-Chain Membership Proofs, will contribute to $XMR’s future success. Best Wallet ($BEST) has raised $19.6M+ in presale with a token price of $0.025925 and a potential 2,291% ROI by late-2026. Best Wallet integrates Fireblocks’ MPC-CMP and a Rubic-powered DEX aggregator, aligning with self-custody demand amid privacy-coin strength. Privacy just reclaimed the spotlight. Monero ($XMR) ripped higher this week – roughly a 20% seven-day surge – as traders rotated out of Zcash and into $XMR, aided by a clean technical breakout and an anticipated network upgrade. The pump retained its momentum, positioning $XMR above the $412 threshold at the time of writing. This performance stemmed from a sector rotation with $12M in shorts squeezed along the way, which is exactly the kind of flow that revives the entire privacy trade. Coinalyze’s long-short ratio is quite telling in this sense. That shift matters because rotations rarely stop at one ticker; they tend to spill across the stack, from coins to the wallets and rails that service them. The pump was somewhat expected, given that $XMR’s developers have been busy: their recent Fluorine Fermi update hardened peer selection against spy nodes, and the next big milestone – Full-Chain Membership Proofs – aims to boost privacy and throughput. That cocktail of technical progress plus fresh momentum is why privacy names are back on your screen. For traders watching risk rotations, this narrative usually sees demand for tools that make private, cross-chain trading simpler. That’s the bridge to Best Wallet Token ($BEST) , the utility token for a mobile-first, non-custodial wallet that bakes strong security and a DEX aggregator into one app. When privacy coins run, the wallets that route liquidity – especially across chains – often catch the second-order bid. Best Wallet Puts MPC Security and Cross-Chain Routing in Your Pocket The Best Wallet app specs read like a checklist for a privacy-leaning, self-custody cycle: Fireblocks’ MPC-CMP technology under the hood, a built-in DEX aggregator powered by Rubic for both same-chain and cross-chain swaps, and a native token – $BEST – that actually does things. These include reduced fees reduction, governance, staking boosts, and early access to vetted presales via an ‘Upcoming Tokens’ portal. The four-phase roadmap details multiple milestones, including a fiat offramp, airdrop launches, a dApps gaming hub, and extensive market intel analytics to keep you connected to the market’s pulse. The positioning hits the moment. Privacy assets are rallying, but liquidity and UX remain fragmented. A wallet that routes across 200+ DEXs and dozens of bridges while keeping keys split via MPC reduces the frictions that push you back to centralized venues. The core app plans support for 60+ chains and is built around mobile UX – arguably the default for retail flow in 2025. For traders who want to keep activity close to self-custody while chasing momentum across ecosystems, that’s the right blend of convenience and control. $BEST Momentum: ~$16.9M Raised as the Presale Draws to a Close Narrative is one thing; presale traction is another – and Best Wallet ($BEST) shows plenty of it. The presale has reached over $16.9M so far. For a wallet token tied to an active product, that scale of commitment suggests buyers are paying for utility, not promises. $BEST is currently sitting at $0.025925. Staking, meanwhile, is designed to bootstrap participation rather than offer fantasy yields, with a 77% yearly APY and a 343M-strong pool. Read that as a structured incentive to get in-app behavior moving, not a permanent income machine. High APYs hint at early-stage incentive design; the tell to watch is how quickly rates normalize as TVL grows and whether usage (fee reductions, presale access) keeps holders sticky. Long-term, Best Wallet aims to capture 40% of the crypto wallet market share by the end of 2026. For this reason, the project has allocated 35% of its 10B total token supply to marketing, and 25% to product development. Based on the project’s utility and scope, our price prediction for $BEST puts the coin at a potential $0.62 by the end of 2026. This represents a 2,291% one-year ROI if you buy your $BEST tokens at today’s price. This type of potential recommends Best Wallet Token ($BEST) as one of the best crypto presales of 2025 and beyond. However, the $BEST presale is coming to an end, with just 18 days to go. With plans for a DEX listing at a price of $0.026035, there’s no better time to buy $BEST at its current early-bird price. Ready to jump in? Join the $BEST presale while you still can. Disclaimer: This isn’t financial advice. Always do your own research before making any investment decision.

MSTY's performance is closely tied to MicroStrategy shares, with a 1% drop in MSTR causing a 1.41% decline in MSTY, amplifying downside risk. Distributions are high but declining, driven by option premium income and capital return, which erodes the fund's net asset value over time. I rate MSTY as a 'Hold' for small allocations only, given its high risk, volatility, and limited growth potential despite attractive cash flow. Investment thesis According to my previous articles, many may think that I belong to the camp of crypto enthusiasts. But I wouldn't call myself that. Although I have been familiar with the cryptocurrency market for a long time (since 2016), I look at many of its projects and digital assets with a great deal of skepticism. When I was first introduced to the features of the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF ( MSTY ), however, I couldn't believe that more than $2.6 billion in AUM could be invested in such a risky and aggressive investment strategy focused on generating high monthly income. Because this fund focuses on using an options strategy when working with Strategy Inc ( MSTR ) securities, the risk and volatility of this asset increase significantly. And that is probably the main reason why MSTY shows negative monthly dynamics. Despite this, if you are willing to risk part of your capital in order to obtain a truly enormous yield (+230.43% per annum), then this asset is for you. A lot of analysts recommend selling it, and I agree with them because MSTY's momentum is still negative, maintaining a steady downward trend. Despite this, I want to find a few reasons to be optimistic about this asset. My recommendation to ""Hold"" is largely based on using a minimal amount of personal capital to purchase this asset with the aim of generating high passive income. Those risks associated with investing in MSTY do not allow this asset to be allocated a large portion of the investment portfolio (no more than 3%). Overview of the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF and its features YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF is an exchange-traded fund focused on working with option contracts to generate monthly income for investors. The mechanism of the MSTY investment strategy is the active management of client funds, utilizing the sale of covered options or option spreads on Strategy Inc ((MSTR)) shares. The scheme is simple and involves the regular sale of call options on MSTR, utilizing the premium received to distribute monthly dividends to the investment fund's investors. Based on the latest info on the fund's website, the MSTY distribution is 98.04% capital gains and 1.96% income. The Distribution Rate is the annual rate an investor would receive if the most recently declared distribution, which includes option income, remained the same going forward. The Distribution Rate is calculated by annualizing the Fund’s most recent distribution and dividing the resulting amount by the Fund’s most recent NAV. Analyzing the payments themselves, it is worth noting that they are decreasing. This is caused by the results obtained in the form of premiums from the sale of options. There are a few reasons for this. Firstly, there is a decrease in the market volatility of the underlying asset Strategy Inc ((MSTR)), because the premium from the sale of call options depends on volatility. Higher volatility means more expensive options and higher premiums. Secondly, there has been a change in the frequency of payments. In fall 2025, monthly payments were switched to weekly payments due to their fragmentation. The third reason is that payments to investors imply a return of capital, due to which the net asset value of the exchange-traded fund decreases. Distributions Importantly, MSTY's investment strategy focuses on generating income from premiums when trading options, but not from direct ownership of MSTR shares. As such, it does not maximize financial gains from situations where the value of MSTR temporarily recovers (as we are seeing in 2025). In effect, MSTY creates an artificial barrier to profiting from the potential upside of MSTR through the sale of options, thereby ensuring a stable cash flow. Although its consistency may be at risk, as payouts may vary depending on the market volatility of MSTR itself. The exchange-traded fund does not directly own the asset Strategy Inc ((MSTR)), but rather uses derivative financial instruments for this purpose. Nevertheless, MSTY correlates with the return on MicroStrategy's stock itself, but not the price dynamics of an asset such as Bitcoin. Technical analysis of Bitcoin, MSTR, and their impact on MSTY Since the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF is an exchange-traded fund linked to MSTR stock options (which is a Bitcoin treasury holder), accordingly, its investment attractiveness should be influenced by market trends in the cryptocurrency market. In the technical analysis of BTC-USD, MSTR, and MSTY, we will use a weekly time frame (1W). First, it is suggested to look at the Bitcoin chart, where it's important to determine the global trend of BTC using classic technical analysis tools. Bitcoin Technical Analysis on the 1W Timeframe According to the weekly chart, we can see that a global upward trend channel has formed. At the same time, the bullish trend did not begin on August 5, 2024 (minimum level—$49,577), but from November 2022. However, the trend channel that is relevant to me is the one that has formed over the past year. Bitcoin's key support level is the June 2025 low of $98,240. The importance of this horizontal line is due to the fact that this is where the lower boundary of the upward trend channel is located. In case the price works with this support level, a liquidity raid is possible, after which the asset will resume growth in the interval of 2-8 weeks of consolidation. Let's now look at the dynamics of MSTR's share price using the same technical analysis tools and the same 1W time frame. While Bitcoin continues its global upward trend, MSTR has formed reversal patterns. In addition to the fact that the price has already moved far from its historical high ($543), in addition, the lower border of the uptrend channel was broken in the region of $330. Moreover, a key resistance zone ($404—$457) exists, due to which the asset's growth is limited. Because of these factors, a downward trend channel has already formed, its upper boundary is now around $415. Moreover, the target of the current decline in MSTR has almost been reached (support level—$231.5). In this zone, there is a whole pool of liquidity formed from equal lows, which raises the likelihood of a raid for a price rebound. However, if the price consolidates below, the next target for decline will be the lower border of the trend channel—the $140 price range. MSTR Technical Analysis on the 1W Timeframe The cause of this discrepancy between the price of Bitcoin and MSTR lies in the risks faced by MicroStrategy. I'll discuss this in more detail in the next section of the article. Let us now move on to analyzing the MSTY chart, where one thing is clear: the asset is in an aggressive downtrend, reminiscent of a ""falling knife"" situation. I could not determine any price range for the trend channel. Basically, we have a continuous price decline that is aimed at an empty chart (due to which there are no support levels or zones). MSTY Technical Analysis on the 1W Timeframe Comparing the MSTY chart with Bitcoin, we can see that there is no direct correlation between them. The MSTR chart, however, shows a similar situation. The only adjustment would be how aggressively each of these assets is moving towards a price decline. MSTR and MSTY both set their historical highs in November 2024, after which a sharp reversal of the uptrend to a downtrend began. If from the high level, the negative dynamics of MSTR turned out to be more modest (according to data for November 7, 2025)—a decline of -56.3%, the decline in MSTY was more aggressive (-79.6%). So, we can say that a 1% drop in MSTR shares causes a 1.41% drop in MSTY value. Risks of the investment thesis Because the results of the technical analysis of Bitcoin, MSTR, and their impact on MSTY revealed a direct correlation between MSTY and MSTR, where the decrease of the second asset by 1% equals the decrease of the first by 1.41%, then accordingly, to assess the risks of the investment idea, you should consider the factors that affect the change in the value of MicroStrategy. A key concept of this organization is to purchase Bitcoin through the issuance of its securities. Earlier, this was done through additional share issues, however, convertible bonds are increasingly being used today. As a major player in this industry, MicroStrategy now owns more than 600,000 Bitcoin. That's almost 3% of the total supply on the market. The latest data shows that its debt is $8.21 billion . For instance, at the start of 2024, this debt was $2.24 billion, which is 72.7% less. Total debt on balance sheet Also worth considering as a risk is that MSTY, like similar exchange-traded funds linked to cryptocurrency assets, has a high standard deviation . As of today, the figure stands at 53.08%, significantly higher than the median for all ETFs, which is 12.43%. Furthermore, the annual volatility of this asset is 70.42%. For instance, the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ), which I have recently recommended as a ""Buy,"" has a volatility of 44.67% . This exchange-traded fund invests in Bitcoin. Conclusion In summary, the results of my fundamental analysis of IBIT allow me to evaluate this ETF as an asset that is accompanied by high investment risk, high market volatility, and a maximum yield received by investors every month (and now every week). My recommendation to ""Hold"" implies a minor investment in MSTY, since the degree of risk associated with it is comparable to the speculative investments that characterize only the altcoin (cryptocurrency) market. It's important to understand that it's the high payouts to investors that lead to significant cycles of decline in the price of MSTY, because a significant portion of the premium paid by the exchange-traded fund is distributed in such a way that the net asset value of the ETF itself decreases. The bottom line is that MSTY is a risky financial instrument; although it has the highest monthly cash flow, it has limited potential growth and is characterized by higher market volatility than MSTR shares and Bitcoin itself. If you're willing to take a risk in order to get high regular payments, then my recommendation is to ""Hold,"" meaning you should buy a small lot size. If you don't think these risks are worth it, then ""Sell"" would be a reasonable decision for your investment strategy.",MSTR|MSTY|MSTR:CA,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-10 12:26:33

The funds are expected to debut this month, with Canary CEO Steven McClurg teasing at Ripple’s Swell conference that they’re ready to launch as early as next week and reminding investors of the successful launches of Litecoin ( LTC ) and Hedera ( HBAR ) ETFs. ETF Institute co-founder Nate Geraci is of the same opinion, stating on Monday, November 10, that the end of the U.S. government shutdown has “opened the floodgates” for new listings, predicting that the first ‘33 Act spot XRP ETF could launch before Friday. “Government shutdown ending = spot crypto ETF floodgates opening… In meantime, could see first ‘33 Act spot xrp ETF launch this week,” wrote Geraci on X. Government shutdown ending = spot crypto ETF floodgates opening… In meantime, could see first ‘33 Act spot xrp ETF launch this week. — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) November 10, 2025 A few days ago, Geraci also flagged Canary Capital’s spot XRP ETF as “coming soon,” adding that WisdomTree had filed for a CoinDesk 20 ETF set to hold the 20 largest crypto assets by market cap (with XRP expected to make up nearly 20% of the portfolio). What do XRP ETFs mean for the market? Hunter Horsley, CEO of Bitwise Asset Management, said in an interview on Sunday, November 9, that a potential XRP ETF could become a major success. According to Horsley, the appeal of the financial product extends far beyond retail investors. Instead, it could provide traditional financial institutions with a compliant entry point to digital asset exposure, expanding the overall crypto investor base. “It’s incredible. You know, I think it’s indicative of the broader story this year, which is: traditional financial services and crypto are finally coming together,” said the CEO. He also highlighted that XRP’s strong position as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap and its active community would likely ensure strong demand once such a product receives regulatory approval. XRP skyrockets XRP has surged more than 12% in the past 24 hours, climbing to $2.56 and outpacing the broader crypto market’s 4.94% gain. The token’s market capitalization also rose from around $135 billion to more than $152 billion in the same period, adding nearly $17 billion in new capital inflows. XRP 1-day price chart. Source: Finbold The renewed push toward XRP ETFs appears to be the main catalyst behind the move. While inclusion on the DTCC list doesn’t ensure SEC approval, it typically means the ETFs are structurally ready to go live once approved. Macro conditions also turned favorable for risk assets. Namely, the U.S. Senate’s approval of a bill to end the government shutdown has helped preserve regulatory continuity for pending ETF reviews. At the same time, talk around the proposed “tariff dividend” lifted investor sentiment, despite the Treasury clarifying it may come as tax relief rather than direct stimulus.

This monumental achievement comes as enterprises worldwide struggle to identify where AI and automation investments will actually yield returns rather than become costly experiments. Scribe’s Massive Valuation Signals AI Maturity The $1.3 billion valuation represents a fivefold increase since Scribe’s previous funding round, demonstrating explosive growth and market confidence. StepStone led the all-equity Series C round with participation from Amplify Partners, Redpoint Ventures, Tiger Global, Morado Ventures, and New York Life Ventures. This substantial funding injection will accelerate the rollout of Scribe Optimize, the platform that finally answers the critical question facing every enterprise: what should we automate first? AI Workflow Optimization: The Missing Piece in Enterprise Automation Most companies are racing to adopt AI, but according to Scribe CEO Jennifer Smith, they lack fundamental visibility into their actual workflows. “Without really knowing how work is done, it is really hard to know where to improve it, where to automate it, where agents can help,” Smith told Bitcoin World. Scribe Optimize addresses this gap by mining workflows across the enterprise to show exactly what people are doing, how often, and how long it takes. Metric Impact Customer Results Workflow Documentation 10+ million workflows across 40,000 apps 94% Fortune 500 penetration Time Savings 35-42 hours per person monthly 5 million+ users Onboarding Acceleration 40% faster new hire ramp-up 78,000 paid organizations Enterprise Automation That Actually Works Founded in 2019 by Jennifer Smith and CTO Aaron Podoln, Scribe predated the generative AI boom but positioned itself perfectly for the current automation wave. Their flagship product, Scribe Capture, automatically documents how work happens through browser extensions and desktop apps, generating step-by-step guides with text and screenshots. Key Benefits of Process Documentation Reduces repeated questions and minimizes errors Expedites employee onboarding and training Provides data-driven insights for automation priorities Enables scalable knowledge transfer across organizations Series C Funding Powers Global Expansion The $75 million investment comes over a year after Scribe’s $25 million Series B, which the company has largely not needed to draw down according to Smith. The San Francisco-based startup plans to double its current headcount of 120 employees in the next 12 months while expanding in key international markets including the U.K., Canada, Australia, and Europe. Transforming How Companies Approach Process Documentation Scribe competes not just against other process documentation tools like Tango, Iorad, UserGuiding, and Spekit, but against the status quo of manual workflow recording. “People are still using stopwatches to sit behind somebody and understand what this process is,” Smith noted. “Even now, when it comes to deploying AI agents, the irony is that the process of deploying agents is incredibly manual.” Actionable Insights for AI Implementation For enterprises looking to avoid AI implementation pitfalls, Scribe’s approach offers valuable lessons: Start with understanding actual workflows rather than theoretical processes Focus on user adoption from the ground up rather than top-down mandates Use data to identify automation opportunities with the highest ROI Build systems that scale organizational knowledge effectively FAQs What is Scribe’s core technology?

According to the perpetual and spot crypto trading platform’ statement on X, the minimum price increment that was previously set at 0.01 will now change to 0.001. The DEX also confirmed the adjustment “will not affect existing open orders.” Dear Aster users, Aster will adjust the tick size (i.e., the minimum change in the unit price) of the ARUSDT Perpetual contract from 0.01 to 0.001, effective at 09:00 UTC, 10 Nov 2025. Existing orders will not be affected by the tick size update. pic.twitter.com/OtyAnaADPp — Aster (@Aster_DEX) November 10, 2025 The new 0.001 tick could help traders set orders at finer levels, improving entry and exit accuracy and during market conditions that limit them to tighter spreads. For example, a trader previously limited to placing an order at $1.10 can now place it at $1.101 or $1.102, imperative for executing short-term trading strategies. Aster changes tick size as stage 4 harvest begins The tick size update comes on the heels of Aster DEX entering Stage 4 of its Dawn program, known as Aster Harvest, after Stage 3 officially ended at 23:59 UTC on Sunday. The upcoming harvest stage introduces 1.5% of the total ASTER supply, distributed evenly in six weekly epochs, with 0.25% allocated per week. Airdrops from Stage 3 will become claimable later this month, with the checker opening December 1 and claims starting December 15. Stage 4 concludes on December 21, at 23:59 UTC. New features in Stage 4 include ASTER being eligible as a margin asset, alongside an Aster Asset Points system that accounts for ASTER, asBNB, and USDF holdings. Using $ASTER as perpetual collateral grants extra points. Selected perpetuals also benefit from a higher leverage ceiling, reaching up to 300x. Fee buybacks and token burns will continue, and users paying fees in ASTER receive a 5% discount, and points can also be earned across perpetual and spot trading on the platform. Aster CEO Leonard Aster is scheduled to join Ember Aster for a live Ask-Me-Anything session at 1 PM UTC on November 10. The discussion will cover AsterChain’s roadmap and the exchange’s future plans. “We are excited to charge forward, & help lead the next generation of BUILDers to build the future of blockchain and finance on AsterChain; providing exciting opportunities for the community, ASTER holders & builders alike,” the Aster Build team wrote on Monday. Aster reclaims $1.10 price level after Coinbase roadmap listing The DEX token has posted a strong performance in the last 24 hours, rising 2.35% in 24 hours, which is just slightly under the broader crypto markets’ 3.7% uptick during the same period. Over the past week, ASTER climbed 11.2%, realized after Coinbase’s November 9 announcement that the token was added to its asset roadmap, causing a 3.5% price spike in the day. Cryptopolitan reported that Coinbase is considering adding the Changpeng Zhao-touted token’s trading pairs after a thorough vetting process, although the listing is not guaranteed, and neither was the listing date confirmed. According to DefiLlama stats , Aster DEX’s perpetual futures volumes reached approximately $11.94 billion, while spot trading accounted for $38.17 million in the last 24 hours. The platform’s cumulative perpetual volume exceeds $509 billion, with cumulative spot trading surpassing $12.7 billion.

Meanwhile, the Bank of England released a consultation paper proposing a comprehensive framework for regulating sterling-denominated “systemic stablecoins.” The plan would require issuers to back their tokens with central bank deposits and UK government debt while also imposing holding limits on individuals and businesses to safeguard financial stability. Overall, both the United States and the United Kingdom are advancing major regulatory initiatives in the crypto sector, as there is a growing need for global oversight of digital assets. CFTC Moves Toward Leveraged Crypto Trading Acting Chair of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Caroline Pham, is reportedly in discussions with several regulated American crypto exchanges to launch leveraged spot crypto products as early as next month. In a post that was shared on X, Pham confirmed her push to expand US crypto market offerings by allowing traders to take leveraged positions in spot markets. This could greatly broaden access to higher-risk, higher-reward crypto trading opportunities for retail and institutional investors. According to Pham, talks are progressing despite the ongoing government shutdown, as the CFTC is still engaging with industry representatives to craft potential guidance for leveraged spot crypto products. The initiative builds on the agency’s earlier efforts in August, when it launched a proposal to enable trading of “spot crypto asset contracts” on exchanges under its oversight. At the time, the CFTC wanted public input on rules surrounding the retail trading of commodities involving leverage, margin, or financing, which suggests that there is regulatory recognition of the crypto industry’s demand for more advanced trading products. Announcement from the CFTC Under existing law, the Commodity Exchange Act grants the CFTC authority over leveraged or margined retail commodity transactions, including cryptocurrencies, unless the buyer takes actual delivery of the asset within 28 days. This means that any leveraged crypto spot product offered in the US must ensure either physical delivery within that time frame or risk falling foul of regulatory restrictions. The push for leveraged spot products comes as Washington grapples with a government shutdown that began on Oct. 1. While many federal agencies paused non-essential activities, Pham’s continued meetings indicate that progress on crypto regulation has not completely stalled. Meanwhile, the US Senate is reportedly close to approving a continuing resolution to end the shutdown, which could potentially clear the way for more active regulatory work. Despite disruptions, several senators still pressed ahead with crypto-related legislative efforts, including a proposed bill to establish clearer market structure rules. Bank of England Moves to Regulate Stablecoins The UK is also making progress with its regulatory plans. The Bank of England (BoE) took a big step toward regulating stablecoins by publishing a consultation paper outlining a proposed framework for sterling-denominated “systemic stablecoins.” The goal of the proposal is to manage potential financial stability risks posed by stablecoins that are widely used for payments in the United Kingdom. This means that the UK plans to align its regulatory stance with that of other major economies like the United States. Under the new proposal, the BoE would require stablecoin issuers to hold at least 40% of their liabilities in unremunerated deposits at the central bank, while the remaining 60% could be backed by short-term UK government debt. This balance is designed to ensure that stablecoins remain sufficiently liquid and secure, while also supporting the resilience of the broader financial system. Consultation paper published by the Bank of England The consultation is open until Feb. 10, 2026, seeks industry and public feedback before final regulations are introduced in the second half of the year. It also includes proposed limits on individual and business holdings of stablecoins. (Source: Bank of England ) According to the document, individuals will be restricted to a maximum of £20,000 ($26,300) per stablecoin, while businesses would face a cap of £10 million ($13.2 million), with possible exemptions for firms that require higher balances to operate effectively. For stablecoin issuers deemed “systemically important,” the BoE suggested that as they grow in scale, they could initially back up to 95% of their assets with UK government debt securities, though this ratio would gradually be reduced to 60% once the issuer reaches a size considered systemically significant. The aim is to strike a balance between stability and operational flexibility as stablecoins evolve in the financial ecosystem. The BoE explained that His Majesty’s Treasury will determine which stablecoin payment systems and service providers qualify as systemically important. Once designated, these entities will fall under the proposed regulatory regime and the central bank’s direct supervision.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-10 13:30:00

The initiative uses Ripple’s U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, RLUSD, on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) to enable faster settlement of traditional Mastercard payments. In her explanation, Diana described how, when a customer uses a Gemini Mastercard, WebBank and Mastercard typically settle funds through legacy banking rails, which can take one to three business days. She noted that Ripple is now entering that process to facilitate instant settlement through RLUSD on the XRP Ledger, cutting out the delays that have long characterized card transaction settlement.

She emphasized that the system would enable the transfer of value to happen “in seconds,” representing a major step toward merging blockchain technology with everyday financial operations . Ripple’s president, Monica Long, described the move as proof of how regulated digital assets can improve payment efficiency, saying it shows how assets like RLUSD can “enhance settlement” and support faster, compliant transactions. The partnership with Mastercard and Gemini also builds upon RLUSD’s growing adoption. Diana pointed out that the stablecoin surpassed $1 billion in circulation in under ten months, a sign of confidence in its stability and regulatory framework. By linking it to a major global payment network, Ripple is signaling its intention to position RLUSD as a trusted instrument for financial institutions and consumers, and use XRP as the foundation for this major economic shift.

A shutdown resolution may not confirm the approval of crypto laws, but it removes a drag on sentiment and refocuses markets on flows and adoption. Bitcoin Hyper targets Bitcoin-native speed and smart contracts via SVM execution, ZK anchoring, and a trust-minimized bridge design. The $HYPER presale reports over $26.4M raised with its staking reward APY at a tidy 44%, tapping into the growing FOMO around its upcoming Bitcoin Layer 2. Bitcoin popped its head above $106K, just as the US Senate advanced a deal that could end a record 40-day federal shutdown, easing one of the heaviest macro headwinds of the past month. The momentum looks policy-linked, not purely technical. Over the weekend, senators cleared a key procedural hurdle on a short-term funding package, with further steps still needed before the lights are fully back on. The macro fog has been brutal on the crypto market over the last few weeks. US policy remains the single biggest sentiment lever for crypto, and the impasse disrupted the legislative calendar and dulled some of 2025’s policy wins. A path to reopening might not pass a crypto bill tomorrow, but it reduces headline risk and lets the narrative rotate back to adoption and flows. If the shutdown resolution sticks, the near-term liquidity backdrop improves, and with it the odds that $BTC holds above the psychological $100K line . For traders watching risk rotations, that brings one sector back into focus: crypto infrastructure projects. These altcoins have a better chance of holding up and driving the next growth wave once volatility settles, as they’re building the underlying tools and systems for the wider market. And that’s where the best presales of this season , like the Bitcoin Layer 2 solution Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , enter the picture. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Aims to Bolt SVM-Speed Onto Bitcoin-Grade Security Bitcoin Hyper is building a Bitcoin Layer 2 using the Solana Virtual Machine for high speed and programmability. This is how the model works: Deposit $BTC, Mint an equivalent amount of wrapped $BTC on the Layer 2, Transact with near-instant finality and low fees, Batch, prove, and commit back to the mainnet. If you’re tired of clog fees and 10-minute confirmations, you get why that could matter. The project’s site outlines the bridge, SVM execution layer, and ZK commitments as core design pillars. Utility-wise, the scope goes beyond payments. The team leans into Bitcoin-native DeFi, faster merchant checkout, and even room for best meme coins and play-to-earn projects to spin up inside the Bitcoin orbit without inheriting the Layer-1 latency. The direction lines up with the broader ‘Bitcoin as a settlement base + expressive L2s’ thesis that has gathered momentum all year. If the shutdown resolution steadies risk, the appetite for Bitcoin-adjacent infrastructure tends to improve with it. For those who believe the next leg of adoption pulls more activity natively into Bitcoin’s gravity well, L2s that can credibly compress fees and time-to-finality deserve a spot on the watch-list. According to our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction , the project’s native crypto $HYPER could very well surge some 2000% post-listing, so snag your Bitcoin Hyper now. The $HYPER Presale is Racing Ahead With $26.4M Raised Bitcoin Hyper is one of the best cryptos to buy now , considering the utility narrative and timing. The macro window and the low presale prices make it an altcoin not to miss this week. The fast-moving presale, which has already broken past $26.4M, suggests real traction with retail. Read our How to Buy Bitcoin Hyper guide for detailed instructions on joining the presale. Currently, the token is selling for $0.013245 per unit, placing it squarely in the retail-friendly bracket typical of infra-narrative presales. The staking rewards at 44% APY are also too juicy to ignore. Additionally, they will smooth the holder behavior after the TGE and subsequent exchange listings. If Washington finalizes a shutdown fix and $BTC holds above $100K, the $HYPER token could take off on its turbocharged debut listing. Even if the deal falls through, it’s best not to wait to grab the token, as the next price surge is just a day away. Join the $HYPER presale today . This article is for information only, not financial advice. Crypto is volatile; presales carry heightened risk and limited liquidity windows.

This groundbreaking move combines blockchain technology with sustainable finance, creating what experts call a revolutionary approach to environmental funding. But what exactly makes this digital green bond so special, and why should cryptocurrency enthusiasts pay attention? What Makes This Digital Green Bond Different? The Hong Kong government’s latest digital green bond represents a significant step forward in financial innovation. Unlike traditional bonds, this issuance leverages HSBC’s blockchain technology to create a transparent, efficient, and secure financial instrument. The digital green bond aims to fund environmentally friendly projects while demonstrating the practical applications of blockchain in mainstream finance. This isn’t Hong Kong’s first venture into digital green bonds. However, the third issuance shows the government’s commitment to refining and expanding this innovative approach. The use of blockchain technology ensures that every transaction is recorded securely, providing investors with unprecedented transparency about how their funds are being used for environmental projects. Why Choose Blockchain for Green Bonds? Blockchain technology offers several key advantages for green bond issuances. First, it provides immutable records of transactions, ensuring that funds are used exactly as promised. Second, the technology enables real-time tracking of environmental impact. Third, it reduces administrative costs and increases efficiency. Here are the main benefits: Enhanced Transparency: Investors can track exactly how their money supports environmental projects Reduced Costs: Blockchain eliminates middlemen and streamlines processes Global Accessibility: Digital format allows international investors to participate easily Environmental Impact Tracking: Real-time monitoring of sustainability outcomes What Challenges Does This Digital Green Bond Face? Despite the exciting potential, Hong Kong’s digital green bond initiative faces several challenges. Regulatory compliance across different jurisdictions remains complex. Market acceptance of blockchain-based financial instruments still needs to grow. Technical infrastructure requirements may limit some investors’ participation. However, the government appears committed to addressing these hurdles through careful planning and international cooperation. The success of this digital green bond could set a precedent for other governments and financial institutions. As more organizations recognize the benefits of combining blockchain with sustainable finance, we may see similar initiatives worldwide. This particular digital green bond represents not just an investment opportunity but a test case for future financial innovation. How Can Investors Benefit from This Initiative? Investors looking to participate in Hong Kong’s digital green bond can expect several advantages. The combination of environmental impact and technological innovation creates a unique value proposition. The bond offers exposure to both sustainable finance and blockchain technology. Additionally, government backing provides a level of security rarely found in cryptocurrency investments. The digital green bond market is still emerging, but early participants may benefit from first-mover advantages. As blockchain technology becomes more mainstream in finance, these instruments could become standard offerings. Investors should consider not just the financial returns but also the environmental impact and technological significance of supporting such initiatives. What Does the Future Hold for Digital Green Bonds? The success of Hong Kong’s third digital green bond could accelerate global adoption of blockchain in sustainable finance.

Bitcoin Hyper sparks presale activity with a Layer-2 solution that will bring more speed and programmability to the Bitcoin network. $HYPER’s presale has already raised $26.4M, as early-bird prices and dynamic staking APY spark viral frenzy. Aster surged 11% in 24 hours, with large wallets snapping up more than 51M $ASTER since the start of November. The token is likely building a volatility squeeze that could force a breakout if resistance caves – a classic ‘smart money before momentum’ setup. Spot data backs the pop. The 24-hour tape had ASTER up by around 5.4% at the time of writing, with price chopping inside a $1.05–$1.13 intraday range. That kind of one-day impulse tells you where fresh capital is probing for upside. When whales test the bid in mid-caps and it sticks, the rotation usually fans out to higher beta plays. That shift matters, because confidence tends to spill over into presales with real narratives. One that keeps surfacing on screens is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – a Bitcoin-anchored Layer-2 project that’s been attracting steady inflows during a messy month for majors. The presale has already raised $26.4M, with no signs of slowing anytime soon. It’s a respectable signal that risk appetite isn’t dead; investors are just being selective now. For traders watching rotations from catalysts like Aster into earlier-stage bets, that makes Bitcoin Hyper’s native crypto $HYPER a timely candidate in the ‘ best crypto to buy ’ conversation. L2 Magic: Bitcoin Hyper’s Design is Straightforward Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) will enable you to use your $BTC on its Layer-2 for fast, DeFi-ready action. Via its canonical bridge , your Bitcoin will be minted onto the Layer-2 as wrapped $BTC, verified with Solana Virtual Machine smart contracts, then moved through high-throughput Layer-2 for instant transactions. Batched updates and zero-knowledge proofs keep everything synced to the native Layer-1. And whenever you want, simply withdraw your wrapped $BTC back to Bitcoin’s base layer, seamlessly. That’s how Bitcoin Hyper will make Bitcoin compatible with the growing Web3 market. In practice, that means near-instant finality for $BTC-denominated actions, plus headroom for on-chain features like staking and swaps that would choke on Bitcoin base-layer latency. The Bitcoin Hyper tokenomics targets the long-term growth of the project more than instant virality, with a published split for development (30%), marketing (20%), rewards (15%), listings (10%), and treasury (25%). It reflects a product-led roadmap rather than a pure meme farm. Check out our comprehensive Bitcoin Hyper review to learn more about the project. Presale Frenzy Heads to a Close The development of Bitcoin Hyper’s crypto infrastructure and the growing investor activity suggest $HYPER’s demand isn’t purely headline-driven. It has the potential to take off if the launch aligns with a broader market rally. In fact, our Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) price prediction sees the token potentially stealing Bitcoin’s spotlight over the coming years with attractive gains for early backers. For those who believe in Bitcoin Hyper’s vision, now is the right time to lock in your support. Currently, the token is selling for $0.013245 in the viral presale. However, the presale is priced to gradually increase across stages and the next price hike is due later today. Take a look at our guide to buying Bitcoin Hyper for step-by-step instructions on joining the presale. Passive income is another magnet drawing early investors to Bitcoin Hyper. Now at 44% staking APY, the opportunity is too good to miss. Remember, though, as more holders join the staking pool, the APY will decrease. And yes, whales are sniffing around too, with some purchasing tokens worth $379.9K , $274K , and $161.3K in single transactions. Ready to jump in? Join the $HYPER presale before the next price surge. Disclaimer: This article is informational, not financial advice. Presales are high-risk and illiquid; staking APYs are variable and typically decline as participation grows. Always do your own research before making any investment decision.

This Canadian publicly traded company’s massive ETH investment represents one of the most significant institutional crypto moves of the year, signaling growing confidence in Ethereum’s long-term potential. Why Is Republic Technologies Betting Big on ETH? The company raised these substantial funds through convertible notes, demonstrating sophisticated financial strategy. More importantly, 90% of this capital—a whopping $90 million—is earmarked specifically for acquiring ETH and expanding validator operations. This Republic Technologies ETH investment isn’t just a casual dip into crypto waters; it’s a full-scale strategic commitment. This move comes at a crucial time for Ethereum, as the network continues to evolve post-Merge.

The Republic Technologies ETH investment sends powerful signals across the cryptocurrency market. When publicly traded companies make commitments of this scale, it often indicates thorough due diligence and strong conviction. Moreover, this move could inspire other institutional players to follow suit, potentially creating a domino effect in corporate crypto adoption. However, such significant investments also come with challenges. The company must navigate: Market volatility management Regulatory compliance requirements Technical infrastructure scaling Security protocols for large holdings How Will This Impact the Broader Crypto Ecosystem? The Republic Technologies ETH investment represents more than just a single company’s strategy—it’s a milestone for institutional cryptocurrency adoption. This substantial commitment demonstrates that major corporations are moving beyond mere exploration and into substantial deployment of capital into digital assets. Furthermore, the focus on validator operations indicates a strategic approach to generating passive income through staking. This aligns with Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake and shows how companies can actively participate in network security while earning rewards. What Can Other Investors Learn From This Move? The Republic Technologies ETH investment provides valuable insights for both institutional and individual investors. The company’s structured approach—using convertible notes and clear allocation targets—shows how sophisticated players enter the crypto space. Their balanced strategy between direct ETH acquisition and validator operations demonstrates comprehensive market understanding. This move also highlights the importance of: Strategic timing in market entry Diversified exposure within the crypto ecosystem Long-term perspective beyond short-term volatility Active participation in network operations Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for Institutional Crypto Adoption The Republic Technologies ETH investment marks a significant turning point in cryptocurrency adoption. This $100 million commitment not only validates Ethereum’s position in the digital asset landscape but also sets a precedent for how publicly traded companies can strategically integrate crypto assets into their portfolios. As more institutions observe this successful deployment, we can expect increased corporate participation in the cryptocurrency space. Frequently Asked Questions How much ETH will Republic Technologies purchase with the $100 million? The company plans to use 90% of the raised funds, approximately $90 million, for ETH acquisition and validator operations expansion. The exact amount of ETH will depend on market prices at time of purchase. What are convertible notes and why did Republic Technologies use them? Convertible notes are debt instruments that can be converted into equity at a later date. This financing method allows companies to raise capital while providing investors with potential upside through conversion options. How does this investment benefit Republic Technologies? The Republic Technologies ETH investment provides exposure to a growing asset class, potential appreciation returns, staking rewards from validator operations, and strategic positioning in the blockchain ecosystem. What risks does this large ETH investment involve? Key risks include cryptocurrency market volatility, regulatory changes, technological risks associated with validator operations, and potential security concerns with large digital asset holdings. Could this trigger similar moves from other public companies? Yes, successful deployments by early movers like Republic Technologies often encourage other companies to explore similar strategies, potentially accelerating institutional crypto adoption. How will this affect Ethereum’s price and network? Large institutional purchases can create buying pressure, while increased validator participation strengthens network security and decentralization, potentially benefiting ETH’s long-term value.

Fast-forward to today, and crypto exchanges are transforming the trading floor into something far more dynamic: a global arena where skill, strategy, and community converge. Gamification was once a marketing gimmick and has evolved into a tool that deepens engagement and cultivates better traders. Trading competitions are no longer side events. They’ve become essential to how exchanges foster liquidity, attract new users, and showcase their technology. In traditional finance, trading contests were largely theoretical or isolated to prop-trading desks. In crypto, they’re live, public, and often backed by prize pools rivaling esports tournaments. They turn abstract derivatives strategies into immersive experiences - and in the process, teach thousands how real markets behave under pressure. Deribit’s Space Edition Trading Competition , launched in partnership with SignalPlus, is a case study in this evolution. With a 450,000 USDC prize pool and multiple competitive tiers, the event takes gamification to orbital heights. Participants can join as individuals in Stellar Solo, band together in Galactic Alliance, or face off in the live Perpetual Battlefield - a real-time duel where traders compete on P&L performance using the company’s perpetual contracts. Daily lotteries, deposit missions, and even physical rewards add an extra dimension of excitement, but beneath the spectacle lies a clear message: this is a competition built for serious traders. Unlike exchanges that focus on volume for volume’s sake, Deribit’s framework gives maximum weight to options trading, reinforcing its reputation as the go-to venue for sophisticated derivatives. By designing challenges around notional volumes, risk management, and team coordination, the competition rewards skill, not just activity. It mirrors the pressure-filled environment of real markets, where discipline and timing determine success. This blending of education, entertainment, and economics reflects a broader trend. Platforms like OKX and Bybit have run massive trading tournaments, often centered on futures. Yet, these events typically emphasize speed and leverage rather than strategy. The social layer is crucial. Teams compete, mentor newcomers, and share strategies across global leaderboards, echoing the camaraderie seen in online gaming guilds. For institutions, these events also serve as soft recruitment grounds - places where emerging talent can demonstrate technical mastery and emotional control under pressure. Ultimately, trading competitions are changing the perception of what participation in financial markets can look like. They blend entertainment with empowerment, transforming the solitary act of trading into a community sport. For Deribit, the Space Edition isn’t just about prizes, it’s about redefining the experience of professional trading. As markets mature and user sophistication grows, expect more exchanges to follow suit. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Through a transparent staking mechanism, the campaign rewards participation while simultaneously removing tokens from active circulation. This is a combination that drives both loyalty and scarcity in equal measure. At its core, this initiative turns engagement into economic impact. Every staker becomes part of a growing global community that fuels the $FUN economy while tightening its supply dynamics. Engagement as a Growth Engine The $FUNToken community has long been a defining strength for the project, and the ongoing giveaway amplifies this connection. Participants are active contributors, staking their tokens, sharing updates, and tracking milestones on the 5m.fun dashboard. Across social channels like the FUNToken Telegram group , discussions about rewards, staking milestones, and leaderboard positions have created a renewed sense of shared momentum. The campaign’s transparency - with every staked token visible on-chain - transforms engagement into proof of participation. Adding to this dynamic is the FUN Message Scoring Bot, which rewards user activity and discussion quality. Together, these tools turn social interaction into measurable community strength, reinforcing $FUN’s position as a holder-driven ecosystem. The Mechanics of Reduced Circulation What sets this giveaway apart is how participation directly influences token supply. When users stake $FUN, their tokens are temporarily removed from circulation. This move ends up effectively reducing the number available for trading. Over 8.7 million $FUN have already been staked, representing a significant contraction in active supply. This means that every new staker not only joins the community but also contributes to tightening liquidity. Unlike typical giveaways that release new tokens into the market, this campaign creates a supply-side adjustment. This is a strategic form of scarcity driven by user action, not artificial limitation. The more users engage, the less freely circulating supply remains, reinforcing a self-sustaining cycle of demand and value retention. A Transparent, Fair, and Trust-Based System The foundation of this community-driven supply shock is a verified Ethereum smart contract that manages all staking, milestones, and reward distributions automatically. ● Fair Distribution: Rewards are allocated proportionally based on the staked amount and the timing of participation. ● Instant Access: Participants can withdraw unlocked rewards immediately once price milestones are met. ● Full Transparency: All staking data, global totals, and milestones are visible to anyone via 5m.fun , ensuring total trust in the system. This architecture removes human bias and central control, empowering the community to see, in real time, how engagement and commitment directly shape the ecosystem. From Participation to Price Resilience According to CoinMarketCap , $FUNToken ($FUN) is currently trading near $0.00256 USD, with a market capitalization of $27.66 million, 24-hour trading volume of $16.32 million, and a total holder base of approximately 98,780 wallets. While prices may experience short-term movement, the deeper trend lies in behavioral change. With tokens being locked through staking, active circulation is shrinking - creating conditions for potential value consolidation over time. Community enthusiasm, combined with transparent staking and milestone-based rewards, is generating a psychological anchor around holding rather than selling. It’s a subtle but powerful shift: users are no longer simply reacting to price, they’re participating in shaping it. Why This Synergy Matters In most token economies, community engagement and token scarcity operate independently. FUNToken’s giveaway fuses them into one mechanism. ● Engagement drives staking. ● Staking reduces circulation. ● Reduced circulation strengthens long-term market confidence. Every staked token becomes both a signal of trust and a mechanism of scarcity. As participation grows, so does the project’s resilience — not through speculation, but through the shared commitment of thousands of active contributors. Conclusion The $5M $FUNToken giveaway has become a masterclass in aligning incentives between users and the market. By encouraging community engagement while naturally reducing token circulation, FUNToken has created a structure where growth and scarcity work hand in hand. The more users stake and participate, the stronger the token’s foundation becomes — turning everyday community actions into forces that shape market stability and long-term value.

By hosting a $5M giveaway at 5m.fun , $FUNToken is not only fostering robust community engagement but also manipulating token scarcity to its advantage. Building a Thriving Community Through Strategic Engagement Central to the success of the $FUNToken giveaway is the heightened level of user engagement it fosters. Every participant of the giveaway is transformed into an active community member who contributes to the vibrancy and sustainability of the $FUN economy. The platform encourages members to stake their tokens, thereby getting involved in the project's growth and tightening the token's supply dynamics, effectively reducing the number of tokens in circulation. Such involvement is further amplified through platforms like the FUNToken Telegram group , where users engage in discussions about the staking process, share updates, and celebrate community milestones. This interactive environment not only nurtures community spirit but also elevates the user's role from merely investing to actively participating. Enhancing Token Scarcity Through User Participation The genius of the $FUNToken giveaway lies in its dual-purpose approach—engagement and scarcity. The campaign cleverly uses the staking process to temporarily remove tokens from circulation, which significantly tightens market liquidity. Remarkably, over 8.7 million $FUN tokens have been staked to date, illustrating a substantial reduction in the active token supply available for trading. This strategic scarcity serves to enhance the token's market value over time, creating a self-perpetuating cycle of demand and value retention. Transparent Operations and Trust Reinforcement The $FUNToken initiative is underpinned by a transparent, trust-based system managed via a verified Ethereum smart contract, which autonomously handles all staking activities and reward distribution. This system ensures that the distribution of rewards is fair, allowing for immediate withdrawal of unlocked rewards once certain price milestones are achieved. The entire process can be monitored on the 5m.fun platform, providing complete transparency and bolstering trust among the community. Market Impact and Economic Implications According to CoinMarketCap , the trading data for $FUNToken reflects a responsive market that is sensitive to the dynamics introduced by the giveaway and staking activities. The interaction between token scarcity and community engagement appears to be forming a robust foundation for future price resilience and long-term value stability. Conclusion The $5M $FUNToken giveaway is not just a promotional event; it is a strategic maneuver to strengthen the token's market position by actively engaging its community and managing its supply. This approach could serve as a model for other crypto projects looking to enhance user engagement while also stabilizing token economics. By turning community actions into a lever for market stability, $FUNToken is setting a precedent in the crypto ecosystem. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Tron historic price sentiment TRON price history Tron, founded by Justin Sun in 2017, raised $70 million through an ICO the same year; it launched its mainnet in May 2018 and migrated TRX from Ethereum to Tron in June, which temporarily boosted TRX’s price to $0.09. TRX reached an all-time high of $0.3004 in January 2018 before dropping below $0.05 a month later; it consistently traded under $0.05 until late 2020, when it began to rise again. In 2021, it reached a high of $0.16. Tron was also reorganized as a DAO as Justin stepped down as CEO of Tron Foundation. TRX was in a bear trend for the best part of 2022, as per crypto market data. In 2023, TRX maintained a consistent bull run, rising from a low of $0.05. In March 2023, the SEC sued Justin for allegedly selling unregistered securities and promoting Tron and Bittorent tokens. In February 2024, Circle’s announcement to cease USDC on Tron led TRX to correct from $0.1429. TRX held above $0.1234 until mid-May, then dropped to $0.1113. The price rebounded to $0.1398 in July but fell again to $0.1213 in early August. By late September, TRX recovered to $0.166, reaching $0.1691 in October and touching $0.2130 in late November. TRX ended 2024 with a price tag of $0.255. Tron was priced at $0.255 at the start of January 2025 and it was trading in a range of $0.204 to $0.257 in February. In March 2025, Tron (TRX) dipped to $0.212, but it recovered to the $0.23 range in April and $0.278 in May, while it observed its yearly high price of $0.370 on August 14. In October, Tron started its descent and fell below $0.30 by the end of the month. At the start of November, Tron is trending below the $0.30 range, maintaining its price above $0.27, as the current Tron sentiment is bearish.",Crypto Price Predictions|TRON,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|ICO|LINK|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|TRX|USDT|RESEARCH|BNB|USDD|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-10 13:55:00

The company’s latest acquisition of 110,301 ETH represents one of the most significant institutional moves in recent months, solidifying their position as a major player in the crypto space. What Does This Massive Ethereum Purchase Mean for Investors? Bitmine’s substantial Ethereum purchase last week brings their total holdings to an impressive 3.505 million ETH. This strategic accumulation suggests several key insights about institutional sentiment toward Ethereum. The timing of this acquisition indicates that major players see current market conditions as favorable for long-term investment in the second-largest cryptocurrency. This Ethereum purchase follows a pattern of growing institutional adoption. Companies like Bitmine are increasingly viewing digital assets as essential components of their treasury management strategies. The scale of this transaction demonstrates that established financial institutions are moving beyond mere experimentation and making serious commitments to cryptocurrency investments. Why Are Institutions Bullish on Ethereum? The decision to make such a substantial Ethereum purchase reflects several fundamental strengths of the Ethereum network. Institutions recognize Ethereum’s established ecosystem and ongoing technological improvements. Here are the key factors driving this institutional confidence: Network Upgrades: Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake has improved scalability and reduced energy consumption Developer Activity: Continuous innovation and a robust developer community DeFi Ecosystem: Ethereum remains the foundation for decentralized finance applications Institutional Recognition: Growing regulatory clarity and acceptance This Ethereum purchase by Bitmine signals that traditional financial institutions are becoming more comfortable with cryptocurrency as an asset class. The transparency of blockchain technology allows investors to verify these large transactions, creating additional confidence in the market. How Does This Impact the Broader Crypto Market? When a publicly traded company like Bitmine makes a significant Ethereum purchase, it creates positive momentum throughout the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. Such moves validate the asset class for other institutional investors who may have been hesitant to enter the space. The visibility of Nasdaq-listed companies investing in crypto helps normalize digital asset ownership among traditional investors. Moreover, this Ethereum purchase removes a substantial amount of circulating supply from the market. When institutions accumulate large positions, it can create supply shocks that potentially drive prices higher over time. This dynamic demonstrates how institutional participation is fundamentally changing cryptocurrency market dynamics. What Challenges Come With Large-Scale Crypto Investments? While this Ethereum purchase represents a vote of confidence, institutional investors face unique challenges when dealing with cryptocurrency assets. Security concerns, regulatory compliance, and market volatility require sophisticated risk management strategies. Bitmine’s continued accumulation suggests they’ve developed robust systems to address these concerns effectively. The company’s ability to execute such a large Ethereum purchase while maintaining regulatory compliance demonstrates the maturation of institutional cryptocurrency infrastructure. This progress makes it easier for other traditional companies to follow similar investment paths. Key Takeaways From Bitmine’s Strategic Move Bitmine’s latest Ethereum purchase provides valuable insights for both institutional and retail investors. The scale and timing of this acquisition suggest that sophisticated market participants see strong long-term value in Ethereum. This move also indicates that cryptocurrency is becoming an increasingly important component of diversified investment portfolios. The transparency of this Ethereum purchase allows market participants to make more informed decisions. Unlike traditional markets where large institutional moves might go unnoticed, blockchain technology ensures that significant transactions are visible to all market participants. Frequently Asked Questions How much ETH does Bitmine now own after this purchase? Following this latest Ethereum purchase, Bitmine’s total holdings have reached 3.505 million ETH, making them one of the largest institutional holders of Ethereum. Why would a public company invest so heavily in Ethereum? Public companies like Bitmine view Ethereum as both a strategic investment and a hedge against traditional market volatility. The potential for appreciation and the growing utility of the Ethereum network make it an attractive asset. How does this affect Ethereum’s price? Large institutional purchases can reduce available supply and create positive market sentiment, potentially supporting price appreciation over the long term. Is this part of a larger trend in institutional crypto investment? Yes, Bitmine’s Ethereum purchase reflects a broader trend of increasing institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies as legitimate asset classes. What security measures do institutions use for large crypto holdings? Institutions typically use sophisticated custody solutions, including multi-signature wallets, cold storage, and institutional-grade security protocols to protect their digital assets. Can retail investors benefit from following institutional moves? While institutional moves can provide market insights, retail investors should conduct their own research and consider their individual risk tolerance before making investment decisions.

Cardano (ADA), Filecoin (FIL) and Internet Computer (ICP) are dominating the conversation in the cryptocurrency space, but Remittix (RTX) is stealing focus. The PayFi project has raised over $28.1 million, selling 684 million+ tokens at $0.1166. With its wallet live, confirmed CEX listings, and a limited 50% bonus before the $30M milestone, Remittix looks positioned to lead. Cardano (ADA): Breakout Setup Meets Scaling Push Source: Whales Crypto Analysts see a falling wedge on the daily chart. A clean bounce and breakout could trigger a 50 to 60 percent move, which keeps ADA on top crypto to buy lists. On fundamentals, Hydra 1.0 targets higher throughput and lower cost, helping apps feel faster. The Midnight protocol adds privacy features that can draw enterprises and developers. Together, these upgrades support ecosystem growth and a healthier market for ADA. If volume rises on a breakout and support holds, the case for a strong leg up improves, especially for long-term holders who want simple, scalable tools. Filecoin (FIL): Storage Demand And Accumulation Source: Analytical Hunter An analyst on X says Filecoin is near a major breakout as price tests key resistance. Rising volume, steady whale accumulation and tight consolidation suggest the next push could carry higher. The utility angle is strong. FIL is evolving into on-chain cloud services that help teams store and serve data. That narrative attracts builders and users who want decentralized storage with clear economics. Grayscale’s holdings add an institutional signal, which is why FIL appears on top cryptos to buy shortlists focused on critical infrastructure. If resistance flips to support and usage keeps rising, momentum can extend. Remittix (RTX): Payments Utility You Can Use Today Investors looking for practical utility keep flagging Remittix on their top cryptos to buy screens. The token targets fast, low-fee transfers and transparent FX and it aligns with the Ethereum stack for smoother wallets and integrations. You can get involved by buying the token on exchanges, testing the live wallet beta and sharing your referral link to grow rewards as you learn the product flow. Why Remittix stays on top of the list: Remittix has raised over $28.1 million by selling more than 684 million tokens, currently priced at $0.1166 each. The Remittix wallet beta has launched, so users can test fast transfers and transparent FX in a live environment. Remittix is CertiK verified and ranked #1 for Pre-Launch Tokens on Skynet. RTX listings are set for BitMart and LBank, with another major CEX reveal teased. Positioned at the intersection of crypto, payments and global remittance, a $19 trillion market. Internet Computer (ICP): Range Reclaim And AI Angle Source: Andrew Crypto Andrew Crypto on X notes ICP reclaimed its range and says a move toward $21 would not be a surprise. The broader story centers on Internet Computer 2.0 and the Caffeine AI platform, shown at the World Computer Summit. Caffeine aims to let people create apps with natural language, while new subnets support scaling. DFINITY’s plan to improve interoperability can pull more projects onto the network. This blend of AI and Web3 compute keeps ICP on top of crypto to buy lists for builders who want faster launches and deeper integration. A firm hold above reclaimed levels would back the technical view. Building Your Top Crypto Basket Alt season stories work best when charts and catalysts meet. Cardano brings a wedge setup and scaling, Filecoin blends accumulation with real storage demand and ICP pairs a range reclaim with AI-focused tooling. Remittix adds live payments utility, CEX traction and daily USDT rewards.

Bybit has grown rapidly to become one of the key venues for derivative trading, and more global acquisitions were anticipated. Bybit has met with Korbit’s management and has already started the acquisition process, stated sources close to the deal, cited by the Maeil Business Newspaper. Korbit itself declined to comment for South Korean media. A Bybit spokesperson shared no knowledge of the potential deal, as there is no announcement through Bybit’s official channels. The two sides also gave no evidence of talks, despite recent news reports. The potential talks between Bybit and Korbit were announced just weeks after Binance acquired GOPAX, the fifth-largest South Korean crypto exchange. South Korean exchanges recently showed the weakest trading volumes in a year, as traders switched to stocks . Despite this, the country has a long-running tradition of crypto activity and a market that may revive at one point. The country also offers clear crypto regulations, suggesting stablecoins may be used in the near future, promising more readily available liquidity. Bybit considers Korbit a natural expansion Bybit’s rise in 2025, in spite of the biggest hack in crypto history, led to the eventual acquisition of Korbit. The market operator is one of the earliest in crypto. Korbit reorganized after filing for bankruptcy in 2017, following two hacking events. According to analysts, South Korean regulators have shown an openness to greenlight foreign exchanges to acquire local crypto companies. Foreign virtual exchanges are also trying to enter the South Korean market, and mergers are a key tool for that goal. Binance’s local acquisition took two and a half years to complete, but it opened the door for additional deals. As of 2025, NXC holds a 60.5% stake in Korbit, with another 31.5% stake belonging to SK. Previous reports claimed that Bybit would focus on acquiring the entire NXC share. Despite the slowdown of South Korean exchanges, the country’s currency is a significant source of liquidity for multiple assets. Since South Korean law forbids financial institutions from acquiring crypto businesses, the only possible buyer would be other crypto firms. Korbit may return to Tier 1 status After years in the market, Korbit remains a relatively minor exchange. The market carries around $21M in volumes, with a dominance of small altcoin markets. However, the exchange is regulated and reorganized, and represents a foothold in the South Korean market. Korbit may expand with Bybit’s features, including the highly active futures markets. Bybit has already achieved over $24B in daily volumes, with a mix of spot and derivative markets. The exchange has surpassed Binance on some trading pairs and has often led in terms of speculative derivative trading. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Recent filings show that Rothschild Investment LLC and PNC Financial Services have disclosed holdings in Solana-linked ETFs, signaling growing confidence in the network despite broader market volatility. This development comes as Solana’s ecosystem strengthens, driven by institutional adoption, staking rewards, and long-term bullish sentiment from analysts. Institutional Interest Expands in Solana ETFs According to new US SEC filings , Rothschild Investment LLC, which manages over $1.5 billion in assets, holds 6,000 shares of the Volatility Shares Solana ETF (SOLZ), valued at about $132,720. PNC Financial Services has also revealed similar positions, underscoring the growing participation of traditional finance players in Solana’s investment products. These moves follow the rising popularity of Solana ETFs, particularly the Bitwise Solana ETF (BSOL) , which allocates 100% of its assets to staking rewards. Investors appear to be shifting from Bitcoin ETFs toward Solana products, attracted by yield opportunities and the blockchain’s growing role in tokenization. This institutional pivot suggests a new phase of capital rotation within crypto markets, favoring high-performance blockchains like Solana over more mature assets. Solana Price Holds Key Support at $147.49 At press time, Solana trades around $169.17 , up nearly 6% in the last 24 hours. Despite a 3.8% decline over the past week, on-chain data from analyst Ali Martinez shows strong support near $147.49, where more than 16 million SOL last moved. This level represents a major accumulation zone that could determine Solana’s next directional move. Source: X If prices hold above $147.49, momentum could push SOL toward resistance at $168 to $191. However, a sustained dip below this area may expose the token to deeper support around $125. The realized price distribution highlights $147.49 as a key psychological and structural level defining short-term sentiment. Analysts See Long-Term Upside Toward $1,000 Market analyst curb.sol projects a long-term uptrend for Solana , noting its consistent respect of an ascending support base between $150 and $160. Each retest has triggered strong buying pressure, confirming investor confidence.

Audited Platform Debunks Competitor Misinformation,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/what-is-xrp-tundra-audited-platform-debunks-competitor-misinformation/,"As competition in the DeFi presale market intensifies, misinformation has become a convenient weapon. Several minor outlets have recently circulated claims questioning the authenticity of XRP Tundra — a dual-chain ecosystem operating across Solana and the XRP Ledger. These reports often omit the key question: what is XRP Tundra, and what verifiable evidence defines its legitimacy? Rather than relying on speculation, the documentation surrounding XRP Tundra provides a transparent answer. From triple smart contract audits to full KYC verification and advanced liquidity design, the project’s structure is engineered to withstand both market volatility and rumor-driven attacks. Dual-Chain Architecture: How XRP Tundra Works XRP Tundra is a decentralized finance ecosystem built to expand XRP’s real utility through verifiable, on-chain infrastructure. The project operates through two interlinked tokens: TUNDRA-S, issued on Solana, serves as the utility and yield token, while TUNDRA-X, deployed on the XRP Ledger, functions as the governance and reserve counterpart. This dual-token setup allows the ecosystem to combine Solana’s transaction speed with XRPL’s transparency and compliance-ready framework. The project’s signature staking system, known as Cryo Vaults, is designed for XRP holders seeking predictable yield rather than speculative trading. Once activated, Cryo Vaults will allow participants to earn up to 20% APY through structured lock periods, all verifiable through smart contract explorers. This function transforms passive XRP holdings into active DeFi positions, strengthening the network’s liquidity base. In the current Phase 10 of its presale, TUNDRA-S is priced at $0.158 with a 10% token bonus, while TUNDRA-X holds a reference value of $0.079. Both tokens carry confirmed listing prices of $2.5 and $1.25, offering measurable upside potential. The project has now raised over $2.5 million, with $32,000 distributed through Arctic Spinner rewards. Each presale phase and transaction can be verified directly via blockchain explorers — a level of transparency that undercuts misinformation suggesting opaque operations. XRP Tundra’s next phase of development will extend its infrastructure through GlacierChain, a planned Layer-2 expansion on XRPL designed to increase interoperability between DeFi protocols and support institutional-scale applications. Verified Security: What the Audits Actually Prove The foundation of XRP Tundra’s legitimacy rests on its audit record. Three independent security firms — Cyberscope, SolidProof, and FreshCoins — have completed detailed code analyses, each confirming that the project’s contracts are stable, renounced, and free of critical vulnerabilities. The SolidProof report delivered a 95% security score and found no critical or medium vulnerabilities. Contract ownership was renounced, minting functions disabled, and all transaction fees capped at 25%. Cyberscope reviewed the Solana contract and assigned an 82% protocol rating with 95% safety, verifying that freeze and update authorities were revoked. FreshCoins independently confirmed these findings and listed the project as a verified audited launch after re-examining its deployment and liquidity configuration. Those exploring is XRP Tundra legit can examine these documents directly. Each is publicly hosted, digitally signed, and timestamped — an evidence chain that few early-stage DeFi projects provide. A video review by HotCuppaCrypto reached a similar conclusion, describing XRP Tundra as “one of the most fully verified presales of the current cycle,” reinforcing the technical legitimacy already confirmed by auditors. Accountability Through Verification: Vital Block KYC and Public Documentation Another frequent point of confusion involves team transparency. Some commentaries have argued that operational anonymity raises red flags, but that claim ignores the formal KYC certification conducted by Vital Block — an independent third-party verification firm. The Vital Block report verified all principal team members through legal documentation and identity confirmation. This certification is published on GitHub, allowing anyone to review the verification record. In the DeFi sector, such third-party KYC represents best practice: it protects both users and developers by balancing accountability with security. Unlike unverified presales that rely on trust, XRP Tundra’s team has submitted itself to compliance procedures that meet international due diligence standards. The result is a hybrid transparency model — operational anonymity paired with verified accountability — that reduces personal security risk while maintaining investor confidence. All governance changes, audit reports, and roadmap updates are released through open-access channels on the official website and social media, reinforcing the project’s ongoing commitment to public documentation. Sustainable Tokenomics and Community Programs Beyond audits and KYC, XRP Tundra’s internal mechanics further disprove claims of unsustainable design. The project employs Meteora’s DAMM V2 (Dynamic Automated Market Maker) to manage liquidity for TUNDRA-S. This system introduces dynamic fee scheduling, where trading fees begin as high as 50% in the early hours of launch and gradually normalize. The mechanism discourages early sell pressure and automated bot manipulation — stabilizing price discovery without imposing manual controls. In addition, the Arctic Spinner program adds a transparent reward layer. Each purchase of TUNDRA-S grants users spins on a verifiable digital wheel that awards instant bonus tokens. Tiered levels — from 4–10% in Tier A to as high as 20% in Tier C — have already distributed over $32,000 in bonuses. Unlike random giveaways, every Arctic Spinner spin is recorded on-chain, ensuring provable fairness. Together, these features make the token economy self-balancing: algorithmic protection against volatility combined with transparent, automated community incentives. Rather than a speculative scheme, XRP Tundra presents a structured financial model rooted in code verification. Facts Over FUD In a market flooded with presale hype and competing narratives, XRP Tundra distinguishes itself by documenting every critical function — from audits to liquidity configuration — in public view. The misinformation circulating online often results not from discovery of wrongdoing but from omission of this evidence. XRP Tundra’s architecture, audits, and verification demonstrate that the project’s integrity is not a matter of opinion but of record. It remains a rare example of a DeFi presale that invites scrutiny instead of avoiding it. Facts outweigh FUD — see what verified transparency looks like with XRP Tundra.

Spot XRP ETF Launch This Week? The timing hinges on fast-moving developments in Washington. On Monday, November 10, Senate leaders advanced a funding package intended to reopen the government, a step that would bring furloughed Securities and Exchange Commission staff back to work and unfreeze routine registration processing. Even as the shutdown lingers, infrastructure for prospective spot funds is materializing. DTCC’s official “Exchange Traded Funds – Active and Pre Launch” file—updated November 7—now includes several applicants: Bitwise XRP ETF, Canary XRP ETF, CoinShares XRP ETF, 21Shares XRP ETF, and Franklin XRP ETF. DTCC’s own disclaimer on that page is explicit: the file lists both active ETFs and “pre launch” products that “are not yet active” and cannot be processed “unless and until such securities have received all necessary regulatory and other approvals.” The convergence of DTCC listings with a prospective government reopening is why Geraci—one of the most closely followed voices in the ETF industry—frames the next several days as a potential inflection point. His post also nods to the legal mechanism that could enable a near-term debut: the Securities Act of 1933’s Section 8(a) pathway to automatic effectiveness. In recent weeks, several crypto ETF issuers have removed the traditional “delaying amendment” from their S-1 registration statements, which—absent SEC action—allows a filing to go effective automatically after 20 days. None of the above, however, substitutes for an approval order or the passage of the Section 8(a) waiting period. DTCC listings historically function as plumbing—CUSIP, symbol, and processing readiness—rather than a regulatory blessing. The presence of leveraged or strategy products tied to the token on the same DTCC sheet and the mix of “Y/N” notations in the “Create/Redeem” column further underscore that DTCC is cataloging what could be processed, subject to regulatory status, rather than declaring anything active. The agency’s own header language leaves no ambiguity on that point. The policy backdrop matters. Multiple newsrooms reported across the weekend and into Monday that the Senate has taken concrete steps toward reopening the government. If the House follows and the President signs, SEC staff would return , potentially accelerating routine correspondence and any last-mile logistics for issuers that chose not to rely on 8(a) automatic effectiveness. Until then, issuers that did remove delaying amendments technically do not need an affirmative SEC declaration to become effective after the 20-day clock, but they remain exposed to potential SEC comments or interventions once operations normalize.

Brett Crypto Price Prediction,https://timestabloid.com/brett-coin-vs-based-eggman-best-crypto-presale-which-crypto-will-go/,"As anticipation for the next crypto bullrun 2025 builds, the search for the best crypto to buy now has never been more intense. Seasoned investors and newcomers alike are carefully evaluating top altcoins to buy, hunting for the elusive 1000x opportunity that can transform a small investment into a life-changing fortune. Two projects currently leading the charge are Brett Coin (BRETT) and Based Eggman (GGs)—but which one is truly positioned to explode in the coming cycle? Based Eggman (GGs): Best Crypto Presale with 1000X Potential Based Eggman (GGs) is turning heads as the best crypto presale of the year. Still available at a fraction of a cent, GGs is not just another meme coin—it’s a multifaceted ecosystem blending viral meme appeal with actual utility, including gaming, social-fi, and streaming features, all built on the Base network. Its capped supply and early-stage momentum mean that even a modest investment today could yield tremendous returns if the project captures the community’s imagination during the upcoming crypto bullrun. Based Eggman GGs Presale and Price Predictions: Industry analysts see Based Eggman (GGs) as a textbook candidate for 1000x gains, with price predictions ranging from $0.10 to as high as $1 by late 2025 if mass adoption and exchange listings align. The project’s low entry price and explosive growth trajectory make it the best crypto to buy November 2025 for those seeking maximum upside in the next cycle. Brett Coin (BRETT): Can Brett Crypto Hit $1? Brett Coin has established itself as a powerhouse on the Base network, boasting an impressive market cap, loyal community, and strong meme branding. It’s widely recognized as a top altcoin to buy for those seeking exposure to the meme coin sector, especially after its rapid growth and successful listings. However, with much of its initial parabolic move behind it, the path to 1000x returns becomes increasingly steep for Brett. Brett Coin Price Prediction November 2025: Most analysts forecast steady, but more modest gains for Brett Coin. Price targets for 2025 generally range from 2x to 5x current levels, with the coin unlikely to hit the $1 mark due to high supply and prior rapid appreciation. Brett remains a solid long-term hold for meme coin fans, but it no longer offers the same explosive growth window as early-stage presale projects. Which Crypto Will Go 1000X in 2025? The Verdict For investors asking “Which crypto will go 1000x in 2025?” the answer is clear: Based Eggman offers the most compelling combination of low entry price, high utility, and viral community potential. Brett Coin is a proven meme coin contender, but its biggest gains may be behind it, while GGs stands at the threshold of its first major bull run. Best Time to Invest in Cryptocurrency: Don’t Miss the Next Wave The best time to invest in cryptocurrency is before a project goes mainstream, making early-stage presales like Based Eggman (GGs) the top opportunity right now. As the market gears up for another explosive run, diversifying with both established names like Brett and high-upside newcomers like GGs gives your portfolio the best shot at capturing the next crypto bullrun’s biggest winners. Conclusion: Best Crypto to Buy Now for 2025 Gains With the next crypto bullrun on the horizon, choosing the right coin could define your financial future. Brett Coin brings stability and strong community support, but for those seeking true 1000x returns, Based Eggman’s presale, capped supply, and viral momentum make it the best crypto to buy now. Don’t miss your chance to get in early on the next breakout star of 2025. Top Brett Coin (BRETT) FAQs List November 2025: Can Brett reach $1? Brett Coin is unlikely to reach $1 due to its extremely high supply and current market cap; for a realistic shot at $1, early-stage projects like Based Eggman ($GGs) offer much better upside. Which memecoin will give 1000x? Based Eggman ($GGs) is the top memecoin positioned for 1000x gains, thanks to its low presale entry, capped supply, and growing ecosystem, far outpacing Brett’s current potential. Why is Brett coin crashing? Brett Coin may be crashing due to profit-taking by early holders, market corrections, or waning hype; in contrast, Based Eggman is still in its growth phase, attracting fresh investment and community support. Which penny crypto will explode? Based Eggman ($GGs), still available under $1 in its presale, is the penny crypto most likely to explode in 2025 due to its unique utility and viral momentum.

Bitcoin is showing signs of preparing for a big move, and therefore the altcoins will probably not be lagging too far behind. $XRP and $ADA are in pole position. Mother of rallies to come in altcoins Source: TradingView Total2 is the chart for the market capitalization of all the altcoins, excluding $BTC . The daily chart above reveals that the altcoins market cap has found strong support at the $1.25 trillion horizontal level. It bounced from there and is now above the major ascending trendline and is currently nestled up against the descending trendline (faint dotted line). While it’s possible that the altcoins market cap doesn’t break out yet, higher lows have continued to be made since April. When Total2 comes back down again this just might be for the final time before a mother of rallies. $XRP up 23% in less than a week Source: TradingView $XRP has been a high-flyer so far on Monday morning. Up more than 7% on the day, the price is also up nearly 23% since touching the bottom of its channel less than a week ago. Judging from the Stochastic RSI indicators in this 12-hour time frame, a local top may be forming soon, if not now. While the high time frame indicators are signalling a very oversold condition, (and that’s what really matters), in the short time frame $XRP is overbought, and we’ll probably have to see perhaps a higher low before the price heads up in all seriousness to the top of the channel and a potential breakout. $XRP getting ready for high time frame breakout Source: TradingView The 2-week chart says it all for $XRP . After the price erupted out of the triangle back in July and hit a new all-time high of $3.66, the price absolutely needed to enter a new distribution period, and it looks as though that period is coming to an end. The price has followed a descending channel and probably tested the bottom in the last 2-week period. The Stochastic RSI at the bottom of the chart has the indicator lines perfectly placed for a cross back to the upside. Things are similar in the weekly time frame. This one is probably going to $4 - quite possibly by the end of this year. $ADA bounces from bottom of descending triangle Source: TradingView $ADA looks to have made its own bottom. The price has just bounced from the bottom of a descending triangle and has also punctured through a small descending trendline. It might be expected that the price continues to go back up to the top of the triangle. The RSI indicator, at the bottom of the chart, has just broken through its own downtrend line, adding validity to the breakout in the price action. Explosive breakout coming for $ADA? Source: TradingView The weekly time frame for $ADA reveals how the descending triangle is actually part of a much bigger wedge pattern, and that this has been forming for more than 4 years. A breakout from this pattern is likely to be explosive. Just like is the case for $XRP , the weekly Stochastic RSI indicators are practically on the floor, while in the 2-week Stochastic RSI the indicators are not far from the bottom. This is setting up for exactly that explosive move. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

What will 1,000 XRP be worth if the U.S. approves spot XRP ETFs? The answer lies in regulatory timing, institutional appetite, and Ripple’s expanding ecosystem. The Road to ETF Approval In recent months, anticipation has surged around a potential XRP ETF. Several fund managers, including Bitwise, Franklin Templeton , 21Shares, Canary, and CoinShares, already have XRP ETF listings under DTCC’s “pre-launch” category. This shows that the infrastructure is ready, but the SEC has not yet granted final approval. Approval will give institutional investors a regulated way to invest in XRP, unlocking a huge influx of liquidity. What 1,000 $XRP coins will be worth in 2026? The moment the SEC approves an XRP ETF, everything changes! pic.twitter.com/aUS2omrzHQ — Skipper | XRPL (@skipper_xrp) November 9, 2025 Skipper’s Insight on the XRP Opportunity Prominent market commentator Skipper explained why ETF approval could be transformational for XRP . He emphasized that Wall Street’s involvement would drive unprecedented demand. XRP’s design, built for utility and real-world payments, strengthens this potential. According to Skipper, the token’s deflationary supply model and Ripple’s expanding use cases create an environment where demand can outpace supply. This is not mere speculation—it aligns with on-ledger data showing consistent transaction growth. Ripple’s RLUSD and the Supply Dynamics Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, launched in December 2024, is already driving major network activity. It has grown more than 600% in volume in its first year, becoming one of the fastest-growing stablecoins globally. Each RLUSD transaction flowing through the XRP Ledger slightly burns XRP, gradually reducing the circulating supply. Although the burns are small, cumulative effects can become meaningful with sustained adoption. As RLUSD volume increases, XRP’s scarcity deepens. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Price Scenarios for 2026 At the current price near $2.50, 1,000 XRP is worth around $2,500. If ETFs are still pending, XRP’s price might reach $3-$6 by late 2026. However, if ETF approvals occur and institutional inflows accelerate, prices could surge toward double digits. In a strong institutional adoption phase, analysts project a potential range of $15–$30 per XRP. That would place 1,000 XRP between $15,000 and $30,000 in value. Risks and Realistic Expectations ETF approval is not guaranteed. Regulatory caution, liquidity shifts, or slower RLUSD growth could temper optimism. XRP burns remain modest relative to total supply, so supply compression alone cannot drive exponential gains. Sustainable price appreciation depends on a combination of forces, including ETF-driven demand, institutional usage, and Ripple’s continued network expansion. The Bottom Line If the SEC approves XRP ETFs in 2025, institutional entry could dramatically reshape XRP’s market profile by 2026. Ripple’s RLUSD growth, coupled with global liquidity demand, supports that thesis. For now, 1,000 XRP equals about $2,500—but with ETF approval and continued adoption, that same holding could be worth several times more within the next year.

Binance has made a significant announcement that will impact your trading strategies. The major Binance delisting of MYRO/USDT and 1000XEC/USDT perpetual futures contracts is scheduled for June 14 at 9:00 a.m. UTC. This decision affects thousands of traders worldwide and requires immediate attention. What Does This Binance Delisting Mean for You? The Binance delisting process involves removing specific trading pairs from the platform permanently. For MYRO and 1000XEC perpetual futures contracts, this means: Trading will cease completely at the specified time All open positions must be closed before the deadline No new positions can be opened after delisting Automatic settlements will occur for any remaining positions Why Is Binance Removing These Contracts? Exchange platforms regularly review their offerings to maintain market quality and protect users. This particular Binance delisting likely results from several factors including low trading volume, liquidity concerns, or strategic portfolio adjustments. Regular contract reviews help ensure that only the most viable and secure trading options remain available to users. How Should Traders Prepare for the Delisting? Proper preparation is crucial when facing a Binance delisting . Here are the essential steps every trader should take: Close all open positions before June 14, 9:00 a.m. UTC Cancel any pending orders on these pairs Withdraw any remaining balances if necessary Explore alternative trading platforms if you wish to continue trading these assets Update your trading strategies to account for these changes What Happens If You Miss the Deadline? If traders fail to close their positions before the Binance delisting takes effect, the exchange will automatically settle all remaining contracts at the final mark price. However, this automated process may not align with your trading strategy, making proactive management the smarter approach. Looking Beyond the Current Binance Delisting This Binance delisting serves as an important reminder about the dynamic nature of cryptocurrency markets. Regular portfolio reviews and staying informed about exchange announcements can help traders navigate these changes successfully. Moreover, diversifying across multiple exchanges can provide additional security against similar events in the future. The upcoming removal of MYRO and 1000XEC perpetual futures represents a strategic move by Binance to optimize their trading offerings. While such decisions may cause temporary inconvenience, they ultimately contribute to a healthier trading ecosystem. Traders who adapt quickly and maintain flexible strategies will continue to thrive in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. Frequently Asked Questions What time exactly will the delisting occur? The Binance delisting will happen precisely at 9:00 a.m. UTC on June 14. All trading activities for these contracts will cease at this moment. Can I transfer these assets to another exchange? While the perpetual futures contracts are being delisted, the underlying assets may still be available on other exchanges or in spot trading on Binance, depending on their individual policies. Will this affect my spot holdings of MYRO or XEC? This delisting specifically targets perpetual futures contracts. Your spot holdings of these tokens should remain unaffected, but always verify with Binance’s official announcements. What happens to my open positions after delisting? Any remaining open positions will be automatically settled by Binance at the final mark price when delisting occurs. However, it’s strongly recommended to close positions manually before the deadline. How often does Binance delist trading pairs? Binance conducts regular reviews of all trading pairs and may delist underperforming or problematic assets several times throughout the year to maintain platform quality. Can this decision be reversed? Once Binance announces a delisting, the decision is typically final. The exchange rarely reverses such announcements once made public.

The promise, which echoes the direct payments of 2020 that helped ignite Bitcoin’s historic bull run, has fueled optimism among investors anticipating a fresh wave of liquidity across financial markets. The move could inject billions into the economy and potentially revive risk-on sentiment, sending speculative assets like cryptocurrencies soaring. Trump defended his tariff policy, calling critics “fools,” and said the plan would exclude “high-income people,” though he didn’t specify income thresholds. According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, the US has already collected over $151 billion in tariff revenue between April and October, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent projecting at least $500 billion annually moving forward. If executed, these payments could not only support consumer spending but also channel a portion of that liquidity into Bitcoin (BTC) and other digital assets, just as seen during the pandemic stimulus era. Bitcoin Breaks Resistance as Bulls Regain Control Bitcoin price prediction seems bullish as BTC is currently trades near $106,338, up 3.7% in 24 hours, with a market capitalization above $2.12 trillion. The recent breakout above $106,000 represents a key technical milestone, signaling a shift in short-term sentiment. A 20-EMA crossover above the 50-EMA confirms strengthening bullish momentum, while a steady series of higher lows reinforces the uptrend. The RSI around 74 points to sustained demand, indicating strong market conviction rather than exhaustion. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Recent candlestick patterns, including a bullish engulfing formation followed by spinning tops, suggest controlled consolidation ahead of another potential leg upward. Bitcoin’s structure now resembles an ascending channel, with buyers repeatedly defending the $104,000 support zone. BTC Outlook: Can Bulls Push Toward $111K? If Bitcoin maintains support above $105,800, the next resistance lies at $108,000, with a more critical barrier at $111,200, a level aligning with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement from October’s decline. A confirmed daily close above $111K could open a pathway toward $114,000, marking a potential continuation of the broader bull cycle. #Bitcoin is back above $106K after Trump vowed $2,000 stimulus checks funded by tariffs. Liquidity boost + breakout momentum = bulls eyeing $111K next. #Crypto #BTC pic.twitter.com/10tEOAXshj — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) November 10, 2025 For traders, the setup favors buying on dips near $105,000, targeting the $108,000–$111,000 range. A drop below $104,000 could spark a brief retest of prior support, though institutional demand appears firm. As global liquidity expectations rise, Bitcoin’s appeal as a hard-cap alternative asset may strengthen further. If Trump’s proposed stimulus checks materialize, the resulting liquidity wave could echo the 2020 stimulus-driven Bitcoin explosion, potentially driving prices toward new all-time highs before year-end. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the Bitcoin ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed. Built as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), it merges Bitcoin’s stability with Solana’s high-performance framework. The result: lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation, all secured by Bitcoin. Audited by Consult , the project emphasizes trust and scalability as adoption builds. And momentum is already strong. The presale has surpassed $26.4 million, with tokens priced at just $0.013245 before the next increase.

The latest addition to the country’s tech sector expansion includes Dubai’s DAMAC Digital, one of the approved projects. The BOI has disclosed that DAMAC’s project includes an 84-MW data center valued at over 26.7 billion Baht. A local investor is also set to inject at least 54.9 billion Baht into a hyperscale data center project with 200 MW of IT load. The board previously approved Singapore-based Empyrion Digital, China’s Beijing Haoyang Cloud & Data Technology, and Thailand’s GSA Data Center O2. Beijing Haoyang plans to construct a 300 MW data center, valued at approximately $2.24 billion (72.7 billion Baht). GSA Data Center O2 also plans to spend over $417 million (13.5 billion Baht) on a 35-megawatt data center. Bytedance has also announced plans to set up 128 billion Baht data hosting services in Thailand. Alphabet Inc.’s Google also committed to investing $1 billion in the country, while Amazon Web Services (AWS) wants to spread a $5 billion investment over 15 years. Microsoft previously confirmed its interest in establishing a regional data center worth over $2 billion in Thailand. BOI chief claims investments will strengthen investor confidence BOI chief Narit Therdsteerasukdi said these data center investments will strengthen investor confidence in Thailand’s investment framework and lead to an increase in employment. The BOI chief believes that they will also have a positive effect on the country’s broader economic development. The BOI has also approved measures to accelerate stalled investments worth over $9.2 billion (~300 billion Baht) as part of an initiative launched by the agency last month. It has further approved six licenses to reduce delays in power availability, work permits, obtaining Visas, and industrial land access. Therdsteerasukdi said the BOI will facilitate and ease investment rules to support the 70 approved projects, which primarily involve data centers, power generation, and electronics. The investment push is reportedly part of the Thai government’s plans to boost the country’s economy, which has been impacted by U.S. tariffs, a strong Baht, and high household debt. Meanwhile, the Krungthai Compass Institute speculates that data center investments in Thailand could increase 13.9 times by 2028. LSEG says Asia Pacific leads in global data center dealmaking The Asia-Pacific region secured approximately $840.47 million in data center deals last year, according to a report published by LSEG (London Stock Exchange Group). However, the value of data center deals in the region is expected to be even higher by the end of 2025. Thailand’s latest investment approvals align with the country’s mission to improve both its digital economy and data security. The large number of international tech investments flooding into the country is expected to boost Thailand ’s economic growth in the tech sector and provide new employment opportunities. “The AI revolution is creating an unprecedented wall of demand for high-quality data centre capacity…The new capacity that needs to be built in the Asia Pacific over the next three to five years is simply mind-blowing. My expectation is that deal flow in the data centre space will intensify.” – Garren Cronin , managing director of Cadence Advisory Surging data center investments in the Asia Pacific reportedly follow a similar trajectory to that in the U.S. and Europe. Tech giants like Meta Platforms are rapidly expanding their AI capabilities. The AI boom in Southeast Asia has also led to a surge in infrastructure development. Data centers that house computer servers and equipment for data processing and storage are rapidly emerging throughout the region.

According to Bloomberg Intelligence’s senior macro strategist Mike McGlone, the answer lies at the $110,000 price level. The cryptocurrency’s ability to reclaim this crucial threshold could determine whether we witness a genuine Bitcoin sustainable rally or continued consolidation. Why is $110K So Critical for Bitcoin’s Future? Mike McGlone’s analysis points to a simple yet powerful technical indicator: the 200-day moving average. Currently, Bitcoin trades below this key level of $110,000 on its monthly chart. This moving average represents the average closing price over the past 200 days, serving as a significant benchmark for market sentiment. When Bitcoin maintains position above this level, it typically signals strong bullish momentum. However, trading below it suggests the market needs additional confirmation before committing to upward movement. The $110,000 level isn’t just a random number—it’s the gateway to a potential Bitcoin sustainable rally that could attract institutional and retail investors alike. What Makes a Rally Sustainable Versus Temporary? Not all price increases are created equal. Understanding the difference between temporary spikes and sustainable growth is crucial for investors. A genuine Bitcoin sustainable rally demonstrates several key characteristics: Consistent upward momentum across multiple time frames Strong volume support during price advances Resilience against corrections and market volatility Fundamental adoption growth beyond pure speculation McGlone’s analysis suggests that reclaiming $110,000 would provide the technical foundation needed for this type of sustained movement. Without this level, any upward price action might prove temporary and vulnerable to rapid reversals. How Can Investors Navigate This Critical Juncture? For market participants, this analysis provides clear actionable insights. The $110,000 level serves as an important watch point for making informed decisions. Monitoring how Bitcoin approaches this resistance can help investors: Identify optimal entry points for long-term positions Set appropriate risk management parameters Understand when market sentiment truly shifts bullish Prepare for potential breakout scenarios Remember that technical analysis works best when combined with fundamental research. While the $110,000 level is crucial for a Bitcoin sustainable rally, other factors like regulatory developments and institutional adoption also play significant roles. What Historical Patterns Suggest About Future Movement Historical data reveals that Bitcoin has faced similar critical junctures in the past. Each time the cryptocurrency successfully reclaimed its key moving averages, it often preceded significant upward movements. However, past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, and market conditions constantly evolve. The current market structure differs from previous cycles due to increased institutional participation and regulatory clarity in various jurisdictions. These factors could influence how the potential Bitcoin sustainable rally unfolds once the $110,000 level is reclaimed. Conclusion: Patience and Perspective Are Key Mike McGlone’s analysis provides a clear framework for understanding Bitcoin’s current position. The path to a genuine Bitcoin sustainable rally runs directly through the $110,000 resistance level. While short-term volatility may continue, the broader narrative remains focused on this critical technical threshold. Successful investors typically combine technical insights like these with their own risk tolerance and investment horizon. Whether Bitcoin achieves this breakthrough quickly or requires more time to build momentum, understanding these key levels helps maintain perspective during market fluctuations. Frequently Asked Questions What is the 200-day moving average and why does it matter? The 200-day moving average calculates the average closing price over the past 200 trading days. It matters because it serves as a key indicator of long-term market sentiment and trend direction. How long might it take Bitcoin to reclaim $110,000? There’s no definite timeline. Market conditions, adoption rates, and macroeconomic factors all influence how quickly Bitcoin might reach this level. What happens if Bitcoin fails to reclaim $110,000? Failure to reclaim this level could mean extended consolidation or potential downward pressure until stronger bullish signals emerge. Should I invest based solely on this technical analysis? No, technical analysis should complement rather than replace thorough research and consideration of your financial goals and risk tolerance. What other factors support a Bitcoin sustainable rally? Institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, technological developments, and macroeconomic conditions all contribute to sustainable price growth. How can I track Bitcoin’s progress toward $110,000? Use reputable cryptocurrency tracking platforms and set price alerts to monitor key resistance levels and moving averages. Found this analysis helpful?

According to multiple industry sources, Bybit executives have recently met with Korbit’s management to discuss a potential acquisition. While negotiations are said to be in the early stages, market observers view the move as a natural progression following similar consolidation trends in the region. Korbit declined to comment, stating that it “cannot share details on matters currently under discussion.” According to South Korea’s Maeil Business Newspaper, crypto exchange Bybit is pursuing the acquisition of Korbit, the country’s fourth-largest exchange. Sources said Bybit recently met with Korbit’s management to begin the acquisition process. Korbit is currently 60.5% owned by… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) November 10, 2025 Foreign Crypto Giants Target South Korea Founded in 2018, Bybit is a fast-growing exchange with Chinese roots that rose to global prominence through its strong derivatives trading infrastructure and user-friendly platform. The company’s reported pursuit of Korbit follows Binance’s successful acquisition of Gopax, South Korea’s fifth-largest exchange, finalized last month after a prolonged regulatory review. These developments indicate a shift in the stance of South Korea’s financial authorities, who have traditionally imposed strict controls on the domestic crypto industry. With local firms constrained by heavy compliance burdens, foreign exchanges appear increasingly set to fill the gap. Regulatory Green Light Spurs Expansion Industry insiders suggest that the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU)—part of South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) —has indirectly paved the way for such deals. In mid-October, the FIU approved Binance’s long-pending request to change Gopax’s management, effectively allowing a foreign exchange to own and operate a local platform for the first time. That approval, granted two and a half years after Binance first applied in March 2023, has emboldened other global players like Bybit to explore similar acquisitions. Analysts say it marks the start of a new phase in South Korea’s crypto market—one where foreign capital and expertise increasingly shape domestic competition. Strategic Stakes and Market Impact Korbit is majority-owned by NXC, the parent company of gaming giant Nexon, with a 60.5% stake, while SK Planetholds 31.5%. SK Group has reportedly been unwinding its crypto-related investments, which could make its stake a primary target for Bybit. Industry sources say the exchange is also considering acquiring NXC’s portion to secure full control. With South Korea ranking as the world’s second-largest crypto market after the United States, Bybit’s entry could intensify pressure on local financial institutions, which remain barred from engaging in digital asset activities under the country’s strict “separation of finance and industry” laws. As foreign exchanges expand aggressively, regulators face growing scrutiny over whether their policies are creating a playing field where global players thrive while domestic financial firms remain restricted.

This staggering drop in USDe circulating supply has sent ripples through the DeFi community, raising crucial questions about the stability of algorithmic stablecoins and their revenue models in turbulent market conditions. What Caused the USDe Circulating Supply Collapse? Market instability emerged as the primary culprit behind the shrinking USDe circulating supply. According to DL News reports and analysis from Colin Butler, Mega Matrix’s head of global financing, the protocol’s fundamental revenue mechanism faced significant pressure. The declining USDe circulating supply directly correlates with reduced incentives for holders, creating a challenging cycle for the stablecoin’s ecosystem. The core issue lies in USDe’s unique revenue generation model. The protocol primarily earns through: Perpetual futures funding rates Yield distribution to depositors Market-neutral strategies How Do Funding Rates Impact USDe Circulating Supply? When perpetual futures funding rates decrease or turn negative, the consequences for USDe circulating supply become immediately apparent. The protocol’s revenue stream shrinks, which subsequently reduces the yield paid to staked USDe holders. This creates a domino effect where: Lower yields discourage new deposits Existing holders seek better opportunities The overall USDe circulating supply contracts This mechanism explains why the USDe circulating supply fell so dramatically during October’s market volatility. Investors quickly responded to the changing yield environment by reallocating their assets to more profitable alternatives. What Does This Mean for Stablecoin Investors? The sharp decline in USDe circulating supply serves as a crucial lesson for cryptocurrency investors. It highlights the inherent risks associated with yield-dependent stablecoins during market downturns. The situation demonstrates that even innovative DeFi protocols can struggle when market conditions turn unfavorable. However, it’s important to recognize that fluctuations in USDe circulating supply are part of the natural market cycle. As funding rates normalize and market stability returns, we may see the USDe circulating supply begin to recover. The key question remains whether investors will regain confidence in the protocol’s ability to generate sustainable yields. Key Takeaways from the USDe Circulating Supply Drop The 40% reduction in USDe circulating supply offers valuable insights for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. This event underscores the importance of: Diversified revenue models for DeFi protocols Transparent risk disclosure to investors Robust stress testing for market downturns Alternative yield sources beyond funding rates The future of USDe circulating supply growth depends on the protocol’s ability to adapt to changing market conditions and restore investor confidence through consistent performance. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly is USDe circulating supply? USDe circulating supply refers to the total amount of Ethena’s USDe stablecoin available and actively trading in the market at any given time. Why did USDe circulating supply drop 40% in October? The drop occurred due to declining perpetual futures funding rates, which reduced yields and made holding USDe less attractive to investors. Is USDe still a safe investment after this drop? Like all cryptocurrency investments, USDe carries risks. The circulating supply fluctuation highlights the importance of understanding the protocol’s revenue model and market dependencies. Can USDe circulating supply recover from this decline? Yes, as market conditions improve and funding rates become more favorable, the circulating supply could potentially recover through increased investor participation. How does USDe differ from traditional stablecoins? USDe generates yield through derivatives strategies rather than holding traditional assets, making its value proposition and risk profile different from asset-backed stablecoins. What should investors monitor regarding USDe circulating supply? Investors should track funding rates, protocol revenue, yield percentages, and overall market sentiment to gauge the health of USDe circulating supply.

With signs of progress emerging from the US regarding the government shutdown , analysts are closely watching to see if political developments could be the spark that elevates XRP from its recent downturn and pushes it to new price levels. US Government Reopening To Trigger XRP Price Rally Levi Rietveld, a well-known crypto analyst on X social media, stated in a post on November 8 that he expects the largest XRP rally in history to occur once the US government shutdown comes to an end. His prediction has garnered significant attention and triggered discussions across the crypto community, as XRP investors start to connect the impact of political stability with digital asset performance. Market analyst, Steph Crypto, also shares the same view. In an X post on November 9, he pointed out that US President Donald Trump has been urging both the Democratic and Republican parties to reach a deal to end the shutdown. The analyst forecasts that once the government reopens, XRP and other cryptocurrencies are likely to experience a significant breakout. Steph is Crypto also reminded XRP holders and community members that when the last government shutdown ended in 2019 , the XRP price rose by more than 70%. He further hinted that history could repeat itself in this bull cycle under similar political conditions. New reports show that several Senate Democrats have joined Republicans to move forward with a bipartisan plan to open the government after 40 days of closure. This is the first real progress seen in weeks, signaling a potential end to the prolonged stalemate. However, the proposal still needs to pass the House before any official reopening can occur. For now, traders remain on edge, closely watching how developments in Washington will play out. The uncertainty surrounding the shutdown has already begun weighing down on the crypto market , with investors bracing for volatility across XRP, Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies. The longer the government shutdown lasts, the more pressure could build on risk assets. XRP Targets $10 On Bull Flag Formation On the technical side, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has noted that the XRP price could be gearing up for a parabolic surge to uncharted territories soon. He shared a detailed chart that shows the cryptocurrency forming a potential Bull Flag pattern on the monthly timeframe. Martinez explained that if this pattern plays out completely, XRP could initially decline by about 22.45% to $1.90 before starting a major rally all the way up to $10.

The Standard Chartered -backed digital asset custodian looked into custody, collateral, and connectivity as the rising backbone of “market infrastructure.” At the same time, stablecoins, staking, and tokenisation are opening up capital efficiency for institutions globally, they said. Building Blocks of a New Market Architecture According to Anoosh Arevshatian, Chief Product Officer at Zodia Custody, as 2026 approaches, the company is seeing a clear theme. “Institutional digital assets are moving from possibility to productivity,” she claims. “We are no longer talking about pilots or proofs of concept, we are talking about infrastructure.” Notably, the report argues: custody will become critical market infrastructure for institutional digital asset activities; stablecoins and tokenised funds will become liquidity foundations; staking and DeFi will grow into institutional yield engines; collateral will redefine capital efficiency. Per Arevshatian, “As 2026 approaches, one theme is becoming clear: 2026 will not be defined by speculation or proof of concepts, but by execution and productivity. Institutions will focus on interoperability, trust, and capital efficiency, and digital asset infrastructure will gradually drive payments, clearing, and settlement as part of the world’s financial backbone.” Zodia Custody’s clients and partners showcase a shift from experimentation to execution, the executive says. They are looking towards a future of finance that is digital, as well as governed, interoperable, and trusted. “Custody, settlement, staking, tokenisation, stablecoins – these are no longer fringe innovations; they are the building blocks of a new market architecture,” Arevshatian concludes.

Five Things to Watch in 2026 Digital Asset Space Zodia Custody’s report lists five key elements to keep an eye on this upcoming year. 1. Custody matures into critical infrastructure This, says the report is a crucial move as it forms “the key orchestration layer needed to unlock digital asset activities.” Custody is “the operational core of institutional adoption; the infrastructure upon which everything else runs.” Custody will no longer be a service, but a system, with compliance, risk, and operational resilience. Regulators will work on global digital custodian standards, rising use cases will lead to digital asset custodians, institutions will adopt multi-custodian models, and custodians will partner up to expand ecosystem connectivity for end users. Deborah Algeo Managing Director, Solutions, commented that, by 2026, “banks will treat digital-asset infrastructure like cloud computing – critical to operations, but not something to reinvent. Sub custody, white-label, and SaaS solutions will become the fastest, safest route to market.” Moreover, Jay Tan, Product Innovation & Advisory Specialist, argued that custody will be “treated as critical financial market infrastructure – as fundamental as payments or clearing.” “We’re seeing regulators and clients align around one clear idea: custody isn’t just safekeeping, it’s market infrastructure. By 2026, I expect board-level policies to mandate multiple custodians and continuous compliance evidence by default. The winners will be those who make regulatory conformity effortless, embedding compliance and security by design,” Tan wrote. Meanwhile, the company is a Canton Foundation member, describing the Canton Network is a ‘network of networks’ for institutional custody. From tokenisation to settlement, the Canton Network is redefining how regulated institutions operate on blockchain, combining privacy, scalability, and interoperability in a single, public, institution-ready network.

Stablecoins evolve into liquidity engines In 2026, stablecoins will not be just settlement tokens, but also programmable treasury tools. Safe and compliant stablecoin infrastructure and global regulatory clarity will boost the ecosystem and the rise of bank-issued and institutional-grade stablecoins. Moreover, stablecoin treasuries will provide 24/7 liquidity, automated payments, and yield-bearing strategies. “The line between cash, collateral, and yield-bearing assets will continue to blur,” the report argues. According to Kelly Lai, Head of Product Innovation & Advisory, stablecoins are “no longer a crypto convenience, they’re the connective tissue of institutional finance. For banks, asset managers, and corporates, they offer what legacy systems can’t: real-time liquidity, programmable control, and transparent backing.” 3. Collateral moves in real time Next year will see digital-asset collateral unlocking “trillions in idle capital,” Zodia Custody says. The growth of real-time margining and settlement will improve transparency but also compress capital cycles. Notably, the experts expect regulators to recognize tokenised assets as eligible collateral, and tokenised money market funds and RWAs to enter collateral pools. “Custody and collateral will merge into one dynamic ecosystem, where capital is always safe, yet always working,” says the report. “Collateral is the quiet force that powers capital markets, and digital assets are rewriting its playbook. As controls, regulation, and confidence mature, what started as cautious experimentation will become systemic change. Slowly, then suddenly,” argues Steven Taylor, Strategic Product Development. 4. Staking and DeFi become yield infrastructure Per the report, staking will shift from “an optional activity to a default feature of digital asset custody.” At the same time, permissioned DeFi vaults will provide regulated access to decentralised yield, with yield being rebuilt as transparent, programmable, and on-chain. Insitutional yield will enter a novel phase with safe connectivity to vetted DeFi and staking networks. Finally, tokenised funds and on-chain credit pools will integrate with custody workflows. Nezhda Aliyeva Head of Product, argued that staking will no longer be a niche yield strategy. Rather, it will be “an operational necessity for institutions seeking compliant, risk-adjusted returns on digital assets.” Therefore, institutional staking is already moving from “experiment to expectation.” Clients want yield, but one provided as other financial operations: segregated, secure, and compliant. “That’s why we’re building staking not as an add-on, but as an integrated capability within custody itself,” Aliyeva said. Also, Sahil Sood, Product Innovation & Advisory Specialist, highlighted that the company is seeing “a convergence of institutional liquidity with DeFi pools, unlocking fascinating new use-cases, from looping strategies with tokenised RWAs to hybrid borrow/lend models that combine DeFi liquidity with centralised collateral.” Sood continued: “Protocols like Morpho are proving that risk-managed DeFi can deliver compelling yields and transparency. By 2026, private DeFi vaults and permissioned markets will be core products for institutions.” 5. Tokenised assets go mainstream The report admitted that this has been predicted many times before. However, the situation is different in 2026, it argues. Notably, the market has seen its infrastructure and tooling improve, tokenised commodities recorded record inflows, and money market funds and short-term credit instruments, among others, are issued, traded, and collateralised on-chain. Custody and collateral infrastructure will make tokenised assets as seamless and secure, while compliant tooling will provide KYC and on-chain identity solutions that will result in institutions treating tokenised funds as digital cash equivalents. They will earn yield while remaining compliant. Finally, “In 2026, capital efficiency – not speculation – will define the institutional digital asset era. Off-exchange settlement (OES) will be the gateway that makes it safe, compliant, and scalable,” says Wing Cheah, Head of Product, Interchange. “Institutions aren’t chasing speculation; they’re chasing capital efficiency. Off-exchange settlement delivers that by putting custody and control back where they belong. As tokenised collateral and regulated venues converge, OES will become the default workflow for serious institutional participation,” Cheah concludes.

Operation GlassWorm, first identified by cybersecurity firm Koi Security late last month, was created by a group hacking VS Code extensions distributed through both the Open VSX Registry and Microsoft’s Visual Studio Marketplace. The bad actors have reportedly been embedding invisible malicious code within legitimate-looking developer tools. Koi security researchers say the campaign is mainly to harvest developer credentials like NPM tokens, GitHub logins, and Git credentials, to enable supply chain compromise and financial theft. According to Koi’s analysis, the same malware has also targeted 49 different cryptocurrency wallet extensions, draining user funds and exfiltrating sensitive data to remote servers. GlassWorm turns developer machines into criminals’ aid As reported by Koi’s team blog article shared on several subreddits, the malicious extensions deploy SOCKS proxy servers and use the compromised developer systems to build up a criminal proxy network. In parallel, they install hidden VNC servers, giving attackers full remote access to victim machines without visible indicators. Stolen GitHub and NPM credentials help the operators infect additional repositories and packages, and allow GlassWorm to propagate deeper into the software supply chain. Open VSX confirmed it had identified and removed all known malicious extensions associated with the campaign on October 21, also revoking and rotating compromised tokens. However, Koi Security’s new report indicates that GlassWorm has resurfaced, using a more advanced form of Unicode-based obfuscation to bypass detection systems. According to the company, seven extensions were compromised again on October 17, amassing a combined 35,800 downloads. Koi’s telemetry also shows that ten infected extensions are currently active and publicly available, and distribute malware as of this writing. “The attacker’s command-and-control infrastructure remains fully operational. Payload servers are still responding, and stolen credentials are being used to compromise new packages.” CodeJoy malware is invincible, Koi security debunks Koi’s risk analysis engine flagged an Open VSX extension called CodeJoy after version 1.8.3 exhibited “unusual behavioral changes.” CodeJoy looks like a legitimate developer productivity tool with hundreds of downloads, a clean codebase, and regular updates. “When we opened the source code, we noticed a massive gap between lines two and seven,” Koi researchers said. “That’s not empty space, it’s malicious code encoded in unprintable Unicode characters that don’t render in your code editor.” CodeJoy invincible code. Source: Koi Research The attackers used invincible Unicode variation selectors that make the malicious payload invisible to the human eye. Static analysis tools and manual code reviews saw nothing unusual, yet the JavaScript interpreter executed the hidden commands flawlessly. When decoded, the invisible characters revealed a second-stage payload mechanism, one that Koi researchers discovered uses the Solana blockchain as its command-and-control (C2) infrastructure. “The attacker is using a public blockchain, which is immutable, decentralized, and censorship-resistant, as their C2 channel,” Koi explained. The malware scans the Solana network for transactions from a hardcoded wallet address. Upon finding one, it reads the memo field, where arbitrary text can be attached to transactions. Inside that memo field lies a JSON object containing a base64-encoded link to download the next-stage payload. A Solana transaction from October 15 displayed in Koi’s analysis contained data that was decoded to a URL hosting the active location for downloading the next stage of the malware. An attacker can rotate payloads by posting a new Solana transaction for fractions of a cent, updating all infected extensions that query the blockchain for new instructions. Per Koi, even if defenders block one payload URL, the attacker can issue another transaction faster than it takes to bring one down. “It’s like playing whack-a-mole with infinite moles,” a Koi researcher noted. Koi Security members Idan Dardikman, Yuval Ronen, and Lotan Sery confirmed that the threat actor has posted fresh Solana transactions containing new command endpoints as recently as this week.

This breakthrough comes after weeks of intense negotiations and uncertainty about federal funding. What Does This Stopgap Budget Mean for Americans? The stopgap budget represents a temporary funding solution that would keep government agencies operational while lawmakers continue working on a comprehensive spending package. This approach prevents what could have been a disruptive government shutdown affecting millions of Americans. Speaker Johnson expressed confidence in the vote count during a press conference, stating that bipartisan support has been secured for this essential measure. The stopgap budget would maintain current funding levels for all federal operations. Why Is This Stopgap Budget Vote So Important? Without this temporary funding measure, the federal government would face a partial shutdown that could: Disrupt essential services across multiple agencies Affect federal employee paychecks and operations Impact economic stability and market confidence Delay critical government functions and services The successful passage of this stopgap budget would provide lawmakers with additional time to negotiate a more comprehensive, long-term spending agreement. How Did Speaker Johnson Secure the Necessary Support? Securing votes for the stopgap budget required careful negotiation and compromise. The Speaker worked across party lines to address concerns from various factions within Congress. Key elements that helped build consensus include: Maintaining current funding levels without controversial policy riders Providing a reasonable timeframe for continued negotiations Addressing urgent priorities from both parties Ensuring essential government services remain uninterrupted What Happens Next With the Stopgap Budget? With the House vote apparently secured, the stopgap budget will move to the Senate for consideration. If passed by both chambers, the measure would then go to the President for signature. This temporary solution would typically fund the government for several weeks while comprehensive budget talks continue. The successful advancement of this stopgap budget demonstrates that despite political differences, lawmakers can find common ground on essential governance matters. However, the real challenge remains reaching agreement on a full-year budget that addresses the nation’s priorities. Conclusion: A Temporary Solution With Lasting Implications Speaker Johnson’s confidence in having the votes for the stopgap budget represents a crucial step toward maintaining government stability. While this temporary measure addresses immediate funding needs, it underscores the ongoing challenges in reaching bipartisan consensus on long-term fiscal policy. The successful passage of this stopgap budget would provide breathing room for more substantive negotiations while ensuring continuity in government services that millions of Americans depend on daily. Frequently Asked Questions What is a stopgap budget? A stopgap budget is a temporary funding measure that keeps the government operating when Congress hasn’t passed full-year appropriations bills by the deadline. How long does a stopgap budget typically last? Stopgap budgets usually fund the government for several weeks to a few months, giving lawmakers additional time to negotiate comprehensive spending legislation. What happens if the stopgap budget isn’t passed? Without a stopgap budget or full-year funding, the federal government would partially shut down, forcing non-essential services to close and furloughing many federal employees. Can the stopgap budget include policy changes? Typically, stopgap budgets maintain existing funding levels and policies to ensure quick passage, though sometimes they include limited, urgent adjustments. How does this affect federal workers? A passed stopgap budget ensures federal employees continue receiving paychecks and government services operate normally. What’s the difference between a stopgap budget and a full budget? A stopgap budget is temporary and maintains current funding, while a full budget sets new spending priorities and policies for the entire fiscal year.

ETOR stock's valuation appears fair, trading at 15x forward earnings and just over 2x book value, with potential upside if profits stabilize and diversify. Management's $150 million buyback and expansion into new products and markets signal confidence, but competition and regulatory risks remain high. I remain neutral on ETOR, recommending a Hold; wait for steadier profits and less dependence on crypto before considering a Buy rating. Looking back at where I stood on eToro Group Ltd. ( ETOR ) in September , when the price sat around $44, things haven’t exactly gotten easier for this stock. It’s dropped another 20 percent and now sits just above $35 before the market opens, close to its recent lows. This is after a three-month period where shares lost nearly 40 percent, even though eToro keeps reporting strong results , just rolled out a big $150 million share buyback and keeps growing its user base and platform assets at a double-digit pace. The business itself is still running strong, maybe even picking up steam but it’s clear the market isn’t fully convinced yet. Even though eToro trades at about 15 times what it’s expected to earn in 2025 (and just over 2 times book value), its profit margins are pretty thin, just over 1 percent and it’s still tied closely to the unpredictable world of crypto trading. The company keeps launching new products and pushing into new markets, but it hasn’t really shown it can generate consistent profits. If management keeps doing a good job and the market feels better, I think there’s real room for the stock to rise but there’s also a lot of risk if crypto cools off or competitors step up. I think the market is right to be careful. ETOR is growing fast but the earnings are still bumpy. The stock looks fairly priced right now considering both the upside and the risk. So for now, this feels like something to wait and watch. So, I’d keep an eye on it but I don’t think it’s time to jump in or sell. Business Highlights (ETOR Q3 2025 Shareholder Presentation) What eToro Is Building and Where Its Money Comes From eToro is a global trading platform where people can buy stocks, crypto, commodities and options and it stands out for its social copy-trading features plus a bunch of newer banking and wealth tools. Management has spent the past year rolling out 24/5 U.S. stock trading, launching tokenized assets , bringing in AI investing tools and pushing wealth products into more places. One move that stands out is the Spaceship acquisition in Australia, which bumped funded accounts up 16 percent to 3.73 million and helped eToro get a stronger foothold in the retirement savings market in Asia-Pacific. They’ve also added a U.K. cash ISA and started offering more local banking features. All this should help them build up some steady income but the reality is that trading and especially crypto, is still the main event for eToro right now. They’re working hard to diversify but it’s still early days for those other lines of business. Four main areas drive eToro’s growth. (ETOR Q3 2025 Shareholder Presentation) Who eToro Competes With and What Could Change This space is wild. eToro’s in the thick of a fintech industry that’s full of competition and moving fast. Big names like Robinhood and Coinbase are stronger brands in the U.S., with deeper pockets and marketing spend and there are always new players trying to break in from all over the world. The way the industry’s changing is pretty interesting. You’ve got the rise of tokenized assets, more people trading socially, these simple investing apps, a whole lot of regulatory headaches and the cost to attract new customers keeps climbing. What gives eToro a leg up is its global reach and social features, especially outside the U.S. In America, though, it’s still a small player and even around the world, it really depends on what everyday people do with their money. If trading is hot, eToro’s business booms but if things quiet down, so does revenue. There’s a real opportunity but there’s also the risk that what they offer just becomes one more thing you can get anywhere. Staying ahead means they’ll need to keep coming up with new ideas and spend their money wisely, or they’ll fall behind. New products and global expansion. (ETOR Q3 2025 Shareholder Presentation) What the Numbers Show In the third quarter of 2025, eToro pulled in $4.11 billion in revenue and net contribution rose 28 percent from last year to $215 million. Net income went up 48 percent to $57 million and adjusted EBITDA was up 43 percent to $78 million. Assets under administration shot up to $20.8 billion. The company really is growing: they have more funded accounts, more interest-earning assets and more money coming through the platform. Even so, margins are still pretty thin. Profit margins are just about 1.4 percent and the stock trades at about 15 times 2025 expected earnings. The thing is, since so much of their business depends on trading (especially crypto), profits are always going to jump around. They’ve got over a billion dollars in cash and don’t have too much debt but they’re still putting a lot of money into new products and growth. If you look at what’s driving the business, crypto commissions grew a ton, equities are strong but income from other stuff isn’t a big deal yet. They’re trying to build up their banking, wealth and subscription businesses but for now, the ups and downs in crypto are what make the difference. I see lots of growth but the way they make money isn’t steady enough yet for me to say you should buy this. People need to see bigger and more steady profits, not just higher sales. Net Contribution Breakdown (ETOR Q3 2025 Shareholder Presentation) Is eToro Stock Cheap or Expensive? On valuation, eToro trades at about 15 times forward earnings and just over twice book value. It actually looks cheaper than Robinhood or Coinbase if you just look at P/E but those companies have different business models and way higher margins. eToro’s price-to-book isn’t scary but it feels like the market is waiting for proof that the profits will last. Unless they start showing steady improvement in margins or really shift their revenue mix, I just don’t see a reason the shares should re-rate higher soon. To me, the stock’s not especially cheap but not expensive either. It’s right in that zone where the potential and the risk pretty much cancel each other out. How the Market Feels About ETOR Lately When you read the headlines, you’d think things were going great: strong growth, a big buyback, new features, AI, tokenized assets, CopyTrader making its way into the U.S. But the stock’s been under pressure even after solid earnings, which tells me investors still have doubts about how stable those profits are. The buyback is a good sign that management thinks the shares are cheap but it also shows just how much eToro depends on the ups and downs of trading and how hard it is to make money from new launches right away. Investors are definitely paying attention to more than just the headline numbers; they want to see profits stick around and more steady income. So the news looks pretty positive but the stock isn’t moving, which means people want to see more proof before they get excited. eToro is buying back shares (ETOR Q3 2025 Shareholder Presentation) The Big Risks I’m Watching There are some real risks here and they aren’t just “what if” scenarios. The biggest is that eToro still depends heavily on crypto trading volumes and prices, which, let’s face it, can swing wildly. There’s also fierce competition from all sides and with regulation constantly shifting around the world, eToro has to keep up with a maze of rules. The company is also betting big on new wealth and banking products and there’s no guarantee those take off. And with all these new ideas like AI-driven investing and tokenized assets, there’s always a chance they end up being flashy features that don’t bring in much cash. On top of all that, trying to grow so quickly and in so many places can stretch management thin. These are the main reasons I think it makes sense to hold the stock for now. Things could go really well if everything works out but there’s just as much risk if something goes wrong, especially with crypto or rules changing. What Could Happen Next Analysts are looking for good earnings growth, with EPS that could hit $2.47 next year and $2.90 the year after and revenue to top a billion by 2027. But for now, I think things will stay pretty bumpy. Trading activity and crypto sentiment are still the main drivers, so quarters could easily swing either way. What I’ll be watching is whether eToro can make more progress in the U.S. with CopyTrader , grow those banking and wealth products and get people using tokenized assets and AI tools. A surprise to the upside could come if any of these new ideas really catch on fast but what investors really want to see is more stable, steady profits that aren’t so tied to what’s happening with crypto. The next year is all about how well they actually perform. If they can show they’re growing margins and making money from more than just trading, I think the shares could go up. Until then, I’m happy to just watch from the sidelines. Funded accounts keep increasing (ETOR Q3 2025 Shareholder Presentation) Where ETOR Stock Could Go From Here If things go south, say crypto trading slows and new products flop, then earnings per share could drop below $2 and the stock could break through those recent lows in the $30s. If things just muddle along, with solid growth but thin margins and earnings staying choppy, I’d expect the stock to hover somewhere between $35 and $50. On the bright side, if eToro really does actually branch out and make more money from new products while crypto stays strong, then EPS could hit $3 or more by 2027 and the stock might finally make a run above $55. What really matters is if the company can show a few quarters of steady growth from different areas. If they can do that, people’s views will change fast. But if crypto, new rules, or new products let people down, I could see shares heading lower in a hurry. Bottom Line: Why I’m Still on Hold All in all, I’m still neutral on ETOR at these prices. The company’s key numbers are headed the right way, management is showing some guts with the buyback and the long-term story still looks good if they can make trading less of a single-focus operation. But until they prove they can grow their profits and become less dependent on crypto, I think the market is smart to be careful. Right now, the chances for gains and losses seem about even.

In a speech titled “A Global Stablecoin Glut: Implications for Monetary Policy” delivered at the BCVC Summit 2025 in New York, Fed Governor Stephen I. Miran said the rising demand for stablecoins is likely to increase purchases of U.S. Treasury securities and other liquid dollar assets. pic.twitter.com/emAEeHwtq8 — Stephen Miran (@SteveMiran) November 10, 2025 This, he argued, could mimic the effects of the early-2000s “global savings glut” that depressed rates worldwide. “Stablecoins may become a multitrillion-dollar elephant in the room for central bankers,” Miran said. “Their growth increases the supply of loanable funds in the U.S. economy, placing downward pressure on the neutral interest rate.” Trillions in Stablecoins Could Lower Neutral Interest Rate by 40 Basis Points Miran’s comments come as the Federal Reserve maintains a target range of 3.75% to 4.00% for the federal funds rate, following two cuts this year. Bitcoin slipped under $110K after the Fed’s 25 bp rate cut, as Powell’s cautious tone and data blackout from the US shutdown left traders uncertain about what comes next. #bitcoin #FedRateCut https://t.co/uMaGFrSKl8 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 30, 2025 The effective rate currently sits around 3.87%, marking a decline from 4.33% earlier in 2025. The Fed governor’s analysis suggests that even without further rate cuts, the rapid adoption of stablecoins could naturally exert downward pressure on borrowing costs. By attracting trillions in reserves into dollar-backed digital assets, much of it from outside the U.S., stablecoins effectively expand the pool of funds available for lending, similar to how global capital inflows once helped keep yields low in the 2000s. According to Miran, the rise of stablecoins could lower the neutral interest rate, the level at which monetary policy is neither stimulating nor restricting the economy, by as much as 40 basis points if adoption projections materialize. Under the new GENIUS Act , passed earlier this year, U.S. stablecoin issuers must hold reserves fully backed by safe, liquid dollar assets such as Treasury bills, repos, and government money market funds. This mandate, Miran said, could substantially boost demand for U.S. debt. The Fed estimates that the stablecoin market could grow to between $1 trillion and $3 trillion by 2030, rivaling the scale of quantitative easing programs from the COVID-19 era. According to Andreessen Horowitz’s “State of Crypto 2025” report, stablecoins processed $46 trillion in transactions over the past year , a 106% increase from 2024, and now rival the U.S. Automated Clearing House (ACH) in payment volume. Stablecoins moved $9 trillion in payments last year, over half of Visa’s volume and 5× PayPal’s, a surge A16z says marks crypto’s real-world breakout. #Stablecoins #StateofCrypto https://t.co/tltfN72grP — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 23, 2025 Collectively, stablecoin reserves hold over $150 billion in U.S. Treasuries, making them the 17th largest holder of American debt, ahead of several sovereign nations. Stablecoins Now Represent Over 1% of U.S. Dollars in Circulation, Reshaping Global Finance Miran compared the rise of stablecoins to the early-2000s “global savings glut,” which saw an influx of foreign capital into U.S. debt markets, driving down yields. The effect, he warned, could be similar: more savings chasing safe dollar assets, reducing the equilibrium or “neutral” interest rate. Economists Marina Azzimonti and Vincenzo Quadrini previously estimated that widespread stablecoin adoption could push rates down by as much as 40 basis points. If accurate, that shift could mean the Fed would need to keep policy rates lower than they otherwise would to maintain economic balance. Miran cautioned that if the Fed failed to adjust to a lower rate, monetary policy could become “unintentionally contractionary.” Once seen as a niche instrument for crypto trading, stablecoins have become one of the largest digital payment systems in the world. Transfers settle in seconds, cost less than a cent, and are increasingly used for remittances, cross-border trade, and decentralized finance (DeFi) activity. Data from A16z shows that more than 1% of all U.S. dollars in circulation now exist in tokenized form on public blockchains, a milestone that underscores how digital dollars are reshaping global finance.

At this point, while Ripple is frequently mentioned with new partnerships, US spot ETFs for XRP are expected to begin trading this week. While XRP and Ripple are gaining good momentum, important statements came from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse. Accordingly, Brad Garlinghouse said that Ripple will not support any legislation that risks eliminating or jeopardizing the legal clarity and transparency that XRP currently provides in the US. Speaking in an interview with Crypto In America, Garlinghouse described XRP’s regulatory position as a milestone won through years of legal battles. The famous CEO said that Ripple will not allow XRP to be compromised. Garlinghouse also noted that XRP is now in a unique position after a US federal court ruled that XRP is not a security. He added that although the court decision is thought to provide clarity specifically for XRP, this clarity benefits not only XRP and Ripple, but the entire crypto industry. At this point, Garlinghouse stated that Ripple will not accept or support any bill that would pose a risk to XRP's current legal status. “Ripple is in a unique position. XRP has clarity. We already have a federal court that said XRP is not a security, so why would we support something that challenges or blocks that?” *This is not investment advice.

The collaboration eyes tapping into Bluefin’s platform to expand access to digital asset products for institutions, and comes amid increased traction for crypto adoption across Wall Street. Sui’s native token could benefit from this traction. However, it traded near $2.16 support area amid recent sell-off pressure. Sui Group partners with Bluefin The centre of this partnership lies in SUI Group’s commitment to lend 2 million SUI tokens to Bluefin, bolstering the platform’s liquidity and operational capacity. Key to the strategic integration is more than the need for on-chain growth – it targets institutional-grade infrastructure within the Sui ecosystem. Bluefin, which is backed by heavyweight investors such as Polychain, Brevan Howard Digital, Susquehanna, and Tower Research, has demonstrated robust growth since its inception. “This partnership extends beyond capital — we are looking to build the bridge from Wall Street to SUI,” said Marius Barnett, chairman of SUI Group. “This model is aimed at enabling SUIG shareholders to benefit directly from the acceleration of institutional SUI trading and liquidity and creating a differentiated and recurring value stream as adoption scales. We are proud to partner with the Bluefin team to build a differentiated trading experience on-chain and drive the long-term growth of the Sui ecosystem. This agreement demonstrates SUIG’s ability to provide liquidity into the ecosystem and drive adoption with leading partners.” Unlocking institutional-grade opportunities on Sui Bluefin and Sui Group are looking to use this collaboration to address longstanding barriers to blockchain adoption in institutional circles. The two firms’ eyes are on Wall Street’s embrace of onchain finance. In this case, Bluefin’s protocol, engineered for high-throughput decentralised trading, unifies perpetuals, spot markets, lending, and Vaults into a seamless interface. Bluefin, which first launched its perpetuals on the Sui blockchain in Q4 2023, surpassed $80 billion in cumulative trading volume. The platform launched its Bluefin Pro as it aimed for further adoption. The platform will tap into Sui’s high-performance architecture that provides a scalable foundation to expand its footprint. Zabi Mohebzada, Co-Founder of Bluefin, captured the synergy: “Partnering with SUI Group is a milestone in our mission to make on-chain markets accessible to the world. SUI Group understands both the culture of crypto-native innovation and the demands of institutional market participants. Their connectivity, credibility, and belief in open financial systems make them the ideal partner to scale both Bluefin and the Sui ecosystem.” Global markets are bullish overall amid regulatory evolution. It means initiatives like this could redefine how institutions engage with digital assets. That becomes even more supported when players prioritise institutional needs but do so without compromising decentralization. SUI Group and Bluefin are taking this route to not just accelerate adoption but architect the next era of on-chain finance.

The new rules effectively apply the country´s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing standards to virtual-asset service providers, which is an important milestone in the application of Brazil’s crypto law of 2022. Although Brazil had approved its crypto legal framework almost three years ago, full enforcement depended on regulations from the central bank, which were to be complementary to the law. Last year, the monetary authority held four sets of public consultations to fine-tune the framework. The set of rules was made public at a time when the use of cryptocurrencies across Brazil is soaring, with stablecoins, or digital tokens supported by real-world assets such as the US dollar, leading the way. Central bank governor Gabriel Galipolo said in August that such instruments are often linked to illegal activities and employed to evade formal financial supervision. Rules take effect in February The new legislation will go into effect in February and will apply to a wide variety of financial players, including foreign exchange and securities brokers, distributors, and virtual asset service providers. According to the central bank’s official announcement, these firms will now need to get specific authorisation to function under the amended compliance framework. The central bank stated that the guidelines seek to fix regulatory gaps that have allowed some virtual-asset platforms to operate with little oversight. Policymakers hope that linking cryptocurrency service providers with existing financial-sector rules will prevent fraud, scams, and the use of virtual assets for illegal reasons. “The new rules will reduce the scope for scams, fraud, and the use of virtual asset markets for money laundering,” said Gilneu Vivan, the bank’s director of regulation, during a press conference announcing the measures. Stablecoins in the spotlight Brazilian regulators have singled out stablecoins for particular scrutiny. In comparison, cryptos like Bitcoin are mostly regarded as investment goods, while stablecoins are placed on average when it comes to payments, providing users with a faster and less expensive alternative to traditional banking channels. Policymakers pointed out that the stability of these tokens with respect to fiat currencies makes them attractive for cross-border transfers and even everyday purchases. But they have also been used to evade taxes and bookkeeping rules. The new forex regulations place any purchase, sale, or exchange of virtual assets pegged to fiat currency under the classification of a foreign exchange operation. Also, the same categorisation applies to international payments or transfers with the use of virtual assets, including settlements of obligations through cards and electronic payment tools. Expanding consumer and compliance protections Apart from the foreign-exchange aspect, the regulation also brings virtual-asset activity within the scope of Brazil’s general financial protections. The rules expand pre-existing standards around consumer protection, transparency, anti-money-laundering, and counter-terrorism financing to the crypto industry. New governance and security obligations will also fall to service providers. Such requirements encompass internal controls, incident reporting, and compliance mechanisms that are consistent with those imposed upon traditional financial institutions. The introduction of the framework illustrates the increasing influence of the central bank on Brazil’s future financial ecosystem. Setting explicit definitions and operational borders is hoped to stimulate innovation while reducing the blight of the growing virtual-asset market. Industry stakeholders have less than three months to comply with the new supply chain criteria before the February deadline. Brazil is taking steps to regulate the rapidly growing domestic crypto market, which has the potential to be a lucrative part of digital finance, to mitigate volatility and dangers.

The president’s tariff policy, which levies steep import fees on countries such as the U.K., Japan, and South Korea, has so far funneled roughly $195 billion. Accordingly, Trump argues that this revenue can bankroll a national “dividend,” effectively a stimulus check for American households. As the crypto industry is emerging as one of the sectors most positively affected by these and similar macroeconomic developments , Finbold consulted OpenAI’s leading large language model (LLM), ChatGPT -5, regarding the top 3 cryptos to buy with your $2,000 tariff check. Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin ( BTC ) remains the flagship crypto by market cap, enjoying wide acceptance and the most positive mainstream sentiment as the “digital gold” or a hedge against macro uncertainty. What’s more, it’s rebounding on Monday , November 10, climbing back to $104,880 at the time of writing after its plunge below $100,000 last week. BTC 1-day price. Source: Finbold Given the asset’s positive reaction to ongoing tariff discussion, trade policy shifts, and likely cessation of the government shutdown, ChatGPT suggests its appeal as a store of value could go up in the weeks to come. Accordingly, the AI claims it would dedicate at least half of the $2,000 check to Bitcoin. Nonetheless, it noted that while Bitcoin is “relatively” more stable than most altcoins, it still swings violently, as evidenced by the largely disappointing “Uptober” season. Ethereum (ETH) Currently trading at $3,546, Ethereum ( ETH ) stands out as the foundation of most decentralized finance ( DeFi ), smart contracts, and Web3 infrastructure. ETH 1-day price. Source: Finbold As Ethereum continues to evolve, ChatGPT predicts its role in Web3 is going to solidify. However, the algorithm noted that competing layer-1 blockchains ( L1s ) or scaling issues could reduce Ethereum’s dominance. That is, the ecosystem’s success will depend on developer adoption, regulatory clarity, infrastructure rollouts, and sustained institutional flows. This somewhat agrees with some technical indicators, such as the Rainbow Chart , which suggests that Ethereum might very well be up for a volatile short-term period. Therefore, the LLM argues that a sum between $600–$800 would be a solid bet on ETH for investors who are seeking long-term growth and infrastructure play but are willing to take a bet. Solana (SOL) The third pick, Solana ( SOL ), is up 3% on the daily chart at the time of writing, trading at $166.28. SOL 1-day price. Source: Finbold Elaborating on its choice, ChatGPT noted that Solana is often cited among the fastest-growing major blockchains in 2025, known for high throughput and low fees. As such, it is arguably a good pick for traders willing to accept higher risk for higher potential return. Still, while the AI added that SOL might offer more upside compared to BTC and ETH, it remains riskier following previous congestion and technical issues. Thus, the chatbot suggested that only $200–$400 of your $2,000 fund should go into SOL as a “growth bet.” All in all, ChatGPT suggested a conservative approach when spending your $2,000 “tariff dividend ,” choosing Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana as the most ideal picks.

Is it the Next Crypto to Explode?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/this-0-035-token-feels-like-cardanos-ada-early-big-run-is-it-the-next-crypto-to-explode/,"The cryptocurrency world is accustomed to comparing the current prospects with the greatest historic showrunners, with Cardano (ADA) being one that created millionaires in the process of its breathtaking price appreciation in the bull run of 2020 and 2021, while the current darling is Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) $0.035 tokens, reminiscent of the early days of ADA. Amid the search by analysts, veterans, or enthusiasts for the next big cryptocurrency, the strong showing of MUTM during its presale, combined with its innovation roadmap, indicates that the altcoin may just be primed for the same type of breakout. This particular altcoin is gaining traction, to be sure, but with more than just the attributes of its purely speculative investment value in mind. The Meteoric Rise of Cardano Cardano’s arc from unknown quantity to dominant force in the marketplace provides a highly interesting study into how altcoins can be developed. In March 2020, ADA was seen languishing at a pittance price of around the $0.02 mark, well off the radar of the mainstream marketplace. However, the next 18 months provided a truly historic price journey, thanks to constant updates and adoption into the marketplace. By September 2021, ADA reached its peak value of $3.10, realizing a value for money investment return that is simply life-altering, with gross profits of even more than 15,400% for those who began accumulating when the project was still in the initial stages. Far from being an isolated incident, the rapid price appreciation stands instead as an indication of the immense potential inherent in the early recognition of ground-breaking innovation. MUTM Finance Presale: Repeating the Early Altcoin Success The Mutuum Finance, or MUTM, presale is currently experiencing the same level of explosion seen in alts such as Cardano in its early stages. Currently, MUTM is 85% full into its 6th phase, with tokens costing only $0.035, having already raised a staggering $18,550,000 from the rapidly increasing community of 17,830 holders. The window to participate is rapidly shrinking, with Phase 6 already selling out quickly, making the current price the last point to acquire tokens. The next phase will apply a nearly 20% hike to the price of $0.040, before the initial launch price of $0.06. The current price structure will bring its buyers huge profits, with the possibility of realizing a 400% gain on investment following the initial launch. Such operational readiness is also one of the differentiating factors, marking the end of the theoretical stage of the project and the beginning of the operational stage, offering an operational product to the world because of the operational readiness of the project. When taking all these aspects into consideration, the future investment in the world of cryptocurrency, in the context of analyzing which cryptocurrency to buy today, MUTM is also made safer due to the staged rollout process, just like the staged builds that made altcoins like Cardano successful in the early stages. Stablecoin Innovation: Improving Ecosystem Utility A key part of the long-term plans of Mutuum Finance is its native over-collateralized stablecoin, which will always be pegged to the value of the US dollar. Notably, the stablecoin will be different from the algorithmic stablecoin because its reserves will be generated from the lending community within its own system, thereby providing yields that help the sustainability of the treasury. It will also be an efficient medium of exchange, in addition to being immune to volatility, hence having an efficient dual-market system structure. The innovation will also help ensure that the tokens are sustained by different uses, hence applicable in creating an assured feedback system having the potential to drive the value of MUTM tokens in the market, which is starved for the best cryptocurrency to invest in. Final Words: A Nexus of Opportunity The story of Mutuum Finance is significantly reminiscent of some of the most crucial moments in the history of the cryptocurrency world, when foresight converged with essentials of real innovation. The fact that the current stage of the Mutuum Finance presale is well underway, coupled with the imminent release of the protocol, brings with it its own complex dynamics in terms of investment options Those who are trying to figure out which cryptocurrency to purchase in the current altcycle pattern in order to be among the early players on the altcoin revolution will soon realize that the MUTM provides them with an extremely rare combination of accessibility, practical application, and possibilities for growth. The moment Phase 6 is completed, the likelihood of purchasing the altcoin on the ground level becomes even slimmer, just as the highly crucial altcycle phases in the legendary altcoins had indicated For more information about Mutuum Finance (MUTM) visit the links below: Website: https://mutuum.com/ Linktree: https://linktr.ee/mutuumfinance",Press Release,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-10 16:00:00

The analyst also revealed what needs to happen for DOGE to witness this parabolic rally. Dogecoin Price Eyes 4,400% Rally To $5 In an X post, the crypto analyst shared an accompanying chart showing that the Dogecoin price could rally to $5 by next year. He raised the possibility that DOGE could repeat its macro cycle, which could spark this parabolic run. Bitcoinsensus also noted that the foremost meme coin has been a master of art in geometrical patterns when it comes to its past cycles. Related Reading: Analyst Says Dogecoin Price Is About To Burst, Here’s The Target This bullish prediction comes despite DOGE’s underperformance, with the Dogecoin price currently struggling below the psychological $0.2 level. However, this bearish sentiment could change soon, as the crypto market, led by Bitcoin, is once again looking to rebound. This rebound follows the U.S. Senate’s move to end the government shutdown that has lasted for just over 40 days. Amid the crypto rebound, crypto analyst Chandler has declared that a Dogecoin price rally to $0.30 is closer than it appears. He had earlier stated that a move back to $0.30 this month or in early November was “coded” as DOGE has been making higher lows since April’s bottom, with each move preceded by a bullish divergence. Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade also indicated that a breakout may be imminent for the Dogecoin price. He revealed that DOGE had formed an inverse Head and Shoulders pattern on the 4-hour chart, with the right shoulder formed successfully. The meme coin is now attempting to break the pattern as it looks to reclaim the $0.2 level, which could spark a larger rebound. “Don’t Underestimate DOGE” Crypto analyst EtherNasyonaL remarked that DOGE should not be underestimated, as he expects the Dogecoin price to still pull off a parabolic rally in this market cycle. The analyst noted that the Dogecoin cyclical nature is quietly retracing its pattern. He added that, as with the first two major price movements in the previous cycles, the foundations for the third major price movement have already been laid. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Prices Are Down The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that the Dogecoin price could at least rally to $1, which would still mark a new ATH for the foremost meme coin. Crypto analyst Mojo stated that DOGE holding above $0.18 looks good for a rebound and that a break above $0.23 could start the next move up. The short-term target is $0.2, while $0.57 and $1 are the swing and long-term targets, respectively. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.18, up over 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The WLFI token leads the rally with a 33% surge, followed by the $MELANIA memecoin and $TRUMP memecoin with a 13% and 12% surge, respectively, in the last 1 week. The government shutdown, which put nearly 900,000 federal workers on leave, also halted important services, including SNAP food aid and airport operations. Congress failed to pass a budget due to disagreements over extending tax credits under the Affordable Care Act. As reported by Cryptopolitan, after 40 days of gridlock at the federal level, the Senate made a 60–40 vote, and just hours after, Democrats decided to back a package that would fund some agencies through the end of the fiscal year and others until January 30, 2026. According to reports, POTUS also told reporters at a football game on Sunday night that it looks like the shutdown will end soon. Trump-linked crypto projects surge up to 30% in a day In 2025, coins tied to Trump became one of the most noteworthy stories in crypto. They had lots of political celebrity endorsements, the fast-paced world of Solana memecoins, and a supply design that made it hard to get at first. For $TRUMP, only about 200 million tokens are in circulation, while the maximum supply sits at one billion. On the other hand, World Liberty Financial released 20% of its token supply on Sept. 1, making WLFI tradable on major centralized exchanges. WLFI token launch profits have also declined sharply. The WLFI market launched in September and briefly added $5 billion to its holdings. However, more than half of that value was wiped out within the first week of trading. Also, POTUS’s crypto portfolio, particularly the donated portion, has now reached an all-time low, dropping below $1 million for the first time. The sharp drop halved DJT’s WLFI portfolio, which had been valued at over $6 billion. At its current price, Trump’s WLFI holdings are valued at $1.25 billion, down from $2.5 billion at the end of September. Meanwhile, the WLFI token is trading at approximately $0.1617, representing a 32% surge in the last 24 hours. This is still below the recent all-time high of $0.336, reached within its first week of launch. On the other hand, $TRUMP is trading at $8.69, a 15% surge in the last 24 hours. The wife’s coin, $MELANIA, is trading at 0.1294, representing a 14% surge in the last 24 hours. Trump’s crypto business amasses more than $1 billion According to analysts, the key driver behind the surge is POTUS’s announcement of a $ 2,000″ tariffs dividend” handout to every American. This has naturally attracted attention to Trump-backed projects again.” Source: Truth Social Trump said on Truth Socia l on Sunday that he might give everyone in the US a $2,000 dividend paid for by tariff earnings, except people with very high incomes. However, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent lowered optimism when he said that the dividend might be just the tax decreases that are being seen on the president’s agenda. Trump’s crypto business has generated over $1 billion. Last month, his son Eric confirmed that the amount could be more than that. Meanwhile, Democrats are still concerned about Trump’s ethics because of his involvement in crypto. They point to his family’s DeFi project, a $2 billion deal with the UAE, and his pardon of Binance founder Changpeng Zhao as examples of clear conflicts of interest. To that end, investors are concerned that once Trump is out of the Oval Office, these coins will be a tale once told. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Crypto addresses are lengthy, difficult to understand, and prone to typos. This has prevented cryptocurrency from being as user-friendly as it ought to be for years. Are you sick of the lengthy, weird character strings that show in your cryptocurrency wallet? Good news! You can finally get rid of the randomness and use something easy to remember, thanks to the collaboration between Freename and Bitcoin.com. Now, you can pick a name that accurately captures who you are! This is a significant step in ensuring that cryptocurrency is available to anyone. Cryptocurrency can now be sent and received much like an email. A straightforward, human-friendly name for your wallet is entered, saving you the trouble of copying and verifying complex addresses. Simplicity is the key in knowing how to choose a Web3 domain . Consider what is unique to you, memorable, and meaningful. What does the announcement tell us? Here are some of the key take‑aways from the press release: Freename partnered with Bitcoin.com Wallet to bring native Web3 domain resolution to more than 75 million wallet users. They launched a new TLD: “.sat”, inspired by the smallest unit of Bitcoin (a satoshi). Owning a “yourname.sat” means your Bitcoin identity is your chosen handle. The integration is designed to work natively within the wallet on mobile—no browser extension, no plug‑in required. Freename also supports more traditional Web2 domains (like .com, .ai, .xyz) being used “on‑chain” for crypto payments and wallet resolution. From this, we can draw guidance on how to choose a Web3 domain and what makes a TLD (top‑level domain) “best” for a crypto address. What makes a “best” TLD for a crypto address? When thinking about the top‑level domain part of your Web3 domain (for example, the “.sat” in yourname.sat), you should evaluate based on several criteria. Below are the major ones: Relevance to crypto / blockchain identityA TLD that signals “this is my crypto handle” is helpful. For example, .sat has a strong link to Bitcoin (sat‑oshi). That relevance helps when someone sees your domain and recognises it means “send crypto here”. So when you ask how to choose a Web3 domain, pick a TLD that aligns with your use case: Bitcoin‑centric, or multi‑chain, or brand/identity. Ease of recognition and memorabilityThe simpler and shorter the TLD, the more people will remember it. Using something like .sat is catchy. If you pick a long or obscure TLD (like .blockchainwallet123), you lose part of the benefit. So in selecting how to choose a Web3 domain, you should prioritise memorability. Wallet / ecosystem integrationIt’s not enough to own the domain: the wallet or platform you use must recognise and resolve it. In the Freename + Bitcoin.com case, the integration is native: you type “alice.sat” in the send field, and the wallet resolves it. If you pick a TLD that isn’t widely supported, you might lose that convenience. So when considering how to choose a Web3 domain, check ecosystem support. Security and long‑term stabilityA TLD backed by a credible registrar or a large ecosystem is more likely to remain functional, supported and secure. For example, Freename is ICANN‑accredited and has launched these new TLDs. When you think how to choose a Web3 domain, include trustworthiness. Flexibility of use beyond crypto paymentsSome Web3 domains and TLDs enable more than just wallet addresses—they can work for websites, email identities, payments, multiple chains. The press release mentions that domains can connect to websites, payments, email. If you anticipate doing more than sending/receiving crypto (e.g., building a web identity, receiving donations), consider a TLD with that capability. Cost and renewal considerationsSome TLDs are premium or expensive to register or renew. When you ask how to choose a Web3 domain, you should factor in ongoing cost. The announcement suggests promotions and discounts but future cost may vary. Availability and uniquenessJust like web domains, you want something unique but also available. If the TLD is popular, many names will already be taken. So when figuring how to choose a Web3 domain, evaluate both the TLD and your desired name within it. Top candidate TLDs for crypto addresses Based on the above criteria and the current market/announcement, here are some of the best TLDs to consider for a crypto address: .sat – This is the TLD from Freename/Bitcoin.com, clearly oriented to Bitcoin use. Because it is new, you may have more chances to pick a short name. Good integration, relevant branding, native wallet support. This makes .sat a strong contender when thinking how to choose a Web3 domain. .crypto, .wallet, .eth, .btc – These are more generic Web3‑oriented TLDs (or domain namespaces) that have been around. If your use is multi‑chain or you want recognition outside of Bitcoin alone, a broader one may help. .com / .ai / .xyz – Traditional Web2 TLDs but here repurposed for Web3 use (via Freename’s “blockchain‑mirroring” tech). If you already have a brand with “.com”, then turning that into your wallet domain may help brand consistency. The trade‑off: maybe less “crypto‑specific” signalling. So when thinking how to choose a Web3 domain, if branding matters, a traditional TLD may win. Brand‑specific or niche TLDs – Some platforms allow creation of custom TLDs or less common ones. If you have a niche community or brand, you might pick a specialized TLD. But the risk: lesser recognition and potentially weaker ecosystem support. Step‑by‑step: How to choose a Web3 domain Putting it all together, here’s a practical guide: Define your use caseAre you using this as a personal wallet address (for Bitcoin, Ethereum, multi‑chain)? Are you using it for your brand? Are you building a website + wallet + identity? Clarifying the use case helps narrow which TLD fits best. Shortlist your desired handleThink of a simple name: your name, your brand, your nickname. Make it readable, easy to type, easy to say. Then pair it with candidate TLDs (e.g., yourname.sat, yourname.crypto, yourbrand.com). This step is central in how to choose a Web3 domain. Evaluate TLD options via the criteria above Does the TLD signal crypto/identity clearly? Is it widely supported in wallets, platforms, browsers (native resolution)? Is it secure, backed by credible registrar? Does it allow you future flexibility (website, email, url) beyond wallet addresses? What is the cost and renewal schedule? Is your chosen name still available under the TLD?These are essential when deciding how to choose a Web3 domain. Check ecosystem integrationFor example: the “.sat” TLD is integrated with Bitcoin.com Wallet. See how your wallet or platform recognises the domain. Confirm that you can type “yourname.sat” (or whatever) and send funds without additional plug‑ins. This ensures your domain will function as intended. Branding & recognitionEven though the domain is meant for wallet addresses, it will likely be shared, printed, put on business cards, etc. Choose a TLD that aligns with your identity. If you’re in the crypto space , a crypto‑specific TLD signals “this is my wallet”. If you’re a more general brand, a .com may feel more familiar. In how to choose a Web3 domain, branding is often under‑considered. Lock in your registration and configure your domainOnce you pick, register it through a trusted registrar (like Freename). Map the domain to your wallet address, set up resolution. Configure any additional features (website, email, alias). Then test: send a small amount to the domain, confirm it resolves to your wallet. This is the operational side of how to choose a Web3 domain: make sure it actually works. Maintain and secure your domainTreat this domain as you would a wallet: apply security best practices (strong registrar account security, two‑factor authentication, monitor renewals). Because your domain is your identity, losing it or having it compromised can cause harm. So when you select how to choose a Web3 domain, security and maintenance are essential. Final thoughts There is no one “perfect” TLD that fits everyone. The best TLD depends on your specific goals, audience, and ecosystem. But based on the emerging trend and current infrastructure, .sat stands out as a strong candidate for Bitcoin‑focused users because of its native integration, relevance, and backing by major players (Freename + Bitcoin.com). If you’re operating more broadly or building a brand beyond crypto, a more traditional TLD repurposed for Web3 use might be right for you. When you ask how to choose a Web3 domain, remember that the domain is more than just a wallet alias—it becomes part of your identity, your brand, your digital presence. Pick a TLD that fits your identity, ensures usability for your audience, and is supported by ecosystem infrastructure. Use the criteria above—relevance, recognition, integration, security, flexibility, cost—to guide you. As crypto and Web3 adoption continues, human‑readable domains will become ever more mainstream. The days of copy‑pasting 40‑character wallet strings are numbered. By choosing your Web3 domain wisely now, you position yourself for smoother interactions, better identity control, and a more professional presence. For those in the crypto space and beyond: take a moment, go through the steps above, and pick the domain that best aligns with your future. And if you’re ready, consider registering the TLD, configuring it, and testing it so you’re ahead of the curve rather than scrambling later.

However, with the advent of Web3 domains through the partnership between Freename and Bitcoin.com, this cumbersome process is poised for a significant overhaul. Web3 domains replace the traditional, error-prone numeric and character-heavy wallet addresses with simple, memorable names. This evolution not only simplifies transactions significantly but also enhances security and reduces the chances of costly errors. Here, we dive into the world of Web3 domains, exploring their benefits, how they work, and why they represent a critical development in the cryptocurrency landscape. Introduction to Web3 Domains Web3 domains function similarly to email addresses in the realm of cryptocurrency. Instead of using a string of numbers and letters, you can send or receive crypto through an easy-to-remember name. This change is akin to moving from a complex set of numerical IP addresses to simple domain names in the early days of the internet. The initiative by Freename to introduce the "".sat"" top-level domain (TLD), inspired by 'satoshi', the smallest unit of Bitcoin, exemplifies this transition. By collaborating with Bitcoin.com, Freename has brought Web3 domain resolution to over 75 million wallet users, facilitating a more user-friendly approach to cryptocurrency management. This strategic partnership allows for native resolution of these domains directly within the Bitcoin.com Wallet, eliminating the need for additional plugins or extensions. Choosing the Right Web3 Domain Deciding on the right Web3 domain involves several considerations. The choice of a domain should reflect your personal or business identity, be easily memorable, and align with your cryptocurrency activities. Here's a deeper look into how to select a TLD that best suits your needs: Relevance: Choose a TLD that relates directly to your crypto activities. For instance, "".sat"" is intrinsically linked to Bitcoin. Memorability: A straightforward and short TLD will be easier for others to recall and use in transactions. Ecosystem Support: Ensure that the TLD you choose is supported by major wallets and platforms for seamless integration. Understanding these fundamentals can significantly enhance your ability to select the most appropriate Web3 domain. For a comprehensive guide on this process, learn how to choose a Web3 domain . Why It Matters The shift to human-readable Web3 domains is not just a convenience but a necessity as the digital currency landscape expands and becomes more integrated into daily financial activities. The ability to easily communicate where to send and receive funds without error is a major advancement in making cryptocurrency accessible to a broader audience. As we continue to witness the growth of digital wallets and the use of cryptocurrency in a wider array of transactions, embracing innovations like Web3 domains will be vital. They not only streamline processes but also enhance the user experience, making it comparable to traditional financial transactions. For additional insights into the workings of cryptocurrency and its underlying technologies, consider exploring further through educational resources on how cryptocurrency works . Conclusion The integration of Web3 domains into the cryptocurrency ecosystem marks a significant milestone towards simplifying digital transactions. By adopting a Web3 domain, users can ensure greater ease of use, improved security, and a reduction in potential errors. As the digital landscape evolves, staying informed and adaptable to new technologies like Web3 domains will be key to navigating the future of cryptocurrency effectively.

After years of consolidation and regulatory flux, the coin appears to be quietly positioning for a meaningful move upward. According to chart‑specialist ChartNerd, the setup is no mere drift—it may be a launchpad for a major leg‑up in value. Multi‑Year Reaccumulation Phase ChartNerd identifies a long base forming for XRP. He notes that, on a log‑scale chart, XRP has traded between approximately $1 and around $3 (its 2017 peak) for a protracted period. In his view, this range has served as a reaccumulation zone—where smart money can build positions quietly. The price action’s prolonged idle phase suggests the groundwork is being laid for what could be a breakout. $XRP is gearing up for a major leg-up. https://t.co/iBfCZPIk6a pic.twitter.com/0aBupcGERQ — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) November 9, 2025 Resistances, Trigger, and Breakout Mechanics The linchpin of the thesis is a breakout above the $3 ceiling. ChartNerd emphasizes that once XRP breaches this resistance with conviction—ideally accompanied by volume and institutional engagement—the setup shifts from accumulation to launch mode. He further argues that market conditions are aligning: regulatory clarity is improving, ecosystem developments around the Ripple Labs‑driven XRPL universe are maturing, and investor sentiment is tilting bullish . These factors, combined with the technical base, could spark the move. XRP Price Target & Upside Implications Should the breakout validate, ChartNerd posits a target in the region of $12.50 for XRP . This target springs from the log‑scale geometry of the base and the magnitude of prior consolidation. In practical terms, such a move would multiply current levels several‑fold. While the target isn’t guaranteed, the risk‑reward profile from this formation appears attractive—especially given the well‑defined base and resistance.

Extended bases can unravel if the breakout fails or if macro conditions deteriorate. For XRP, regulatory clarity remains a variable—even though meaningful progress has been achieved. Nonetheless, from a structure‑and‑market macro perspective, the current price band offers a relatively defined risk zone. Support near the bottom of the base limits downside, while a breakout could unlock large upside. In the broader crypto market—characterized by renewed institutional interest and more robust infrastructure—the timing appears favorable. In summary, ChartNerd’s analysis presents a crisp narrative: XRP may be transitioning out of a long consolidation , and the breakout above $3 could trigger a leg‑up toward $12.50. For traders and long‑term holders alike, the message is clear: watch for confirmation of the breakout, define your risk zones, and prepare for the possibility of outsized reward. As always, conduct your own due diligence and align exposure to your individual risk tolerance. Disclaimer: This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

As of late October 2025, BTC is trading in the neighbourhood of ≈ $110,000–$115,000. For example, on 25 October 2025 the closing price was reported at ~$111,641.73. After briefly touching a record high above $125,000 earlier this month, Bitcoin has entered a consolidation phase. Despite recent fluctuations, the world’s largest cryptocurrency maintains a market capitalization above $2.1 trillion, reaffirming its position as the top digital asset by value. Analysts suggest the cooling period comes as traders lock in profits and the broader market digests macroeconomic pressures such as a stronger U.S. dollar and mixed signals from global equity markets. Technical Outlook: RSI, MACD, and Key Levels Technical indicators point to a neutral tone in the short term. The RSI stands near 47, showing neither overbought nor oversold conditions. The MACD has flattened, signaling that momentum is stabilizing after a strong upward run earlier in October. The 200-day SMA sits around $110,000, a key support zone. As long as Bitcoin stays above this mark, the broader trend remains bullish. The 50-day SMA near $117,500 acts as the first major resistance to the upside. Immediate support levels are seen around $111,000 and $108,000, while resistance sits near $115,500 and $118,000. A breakout above these levels could open the door for a retest of the $125,000 all-time high, while a drop below $108,000 may trigger a deeper pullback toward $100,000. Why Bitcoin May Rise or Fall Recent weakness has been linked to temporary risk-off sentiment in global markets and profit-taking by large investors. However, long-term fundamentals remain strong. Growing institutional adoption through Bitcoin ETFs, continued accumulation by corporations, and expectations of another halving cycle push optimism for a renewed rally in 2026–2027. If institutional inflows continue and regulatory clarity improves, analysts believe Bitcoin could reach $260,000 by late 2027, representing a 140 % increase from current prices. This projection assumes a sustained uptrend following the next halving, historically known to trigger multi-year bull markets. Ozak AI: The Rising Star in the Presale Market While Bitcoin’s long-term potential remains impressive, a new project called Ozak AI is capturing attention for its explosive growth in the presale market. The project integrates artificial intelligence with blockchain technology to provide real-time market analytics, predictive trading insights, and data-driven tools for investors. Ozak AI operates on Arbitrum Orbit, ensuring faster transactions and low fees. It uses Prediction Agents (PAs)—customizable modules that analyze live and historical data to forecast crypto market trends. Its Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) model and Ozak Stream Network (OSN) deliver secure, real-time data processing. The native $OZ token powers transactions, staking, governance, and access to premium market tools. The project also features a Rewards Hub where users earn tokens for completing research and trading activities. Presale Performance Since launching at just $0.001, the OZ token has surged 1,100 % to its current Phase 6 price of $0.012, with the next phase set at $0.014. So far, the project has sold 986,686,679 tokens, raising over $4.24 million in total. The team targets a $1.00 listing price once the presale concludes. At the current presale price of $0.012, a $1,000 investment would purchase approximately 83,333 OZ tokens. If the token hits its $1.00 target, that investment could grow to $83,333, delivering an 83× return (8,233 %). For early investors who bought during the initial $0.001 phase, the potential gain to $1 would represent a 1,000× ROI, turning a $1,000 investment into $1 million — a remarkable leap if the project fulfills its goals and achieves the forecasted valuation. Key Partnerships and Progress Ozak AI has secured several notable collaborations: Pyth Network for real-time market data feeds. Hive Intel for on-chain data integration. Weblume to embed Ozak AI signals in custom Web3 dashboards. SINT Labs to enable automated trade execution using Ozak’s predictive outputs. Dex3 for decentralized trading infrastructure. Final Thoughts Bitcoin continues to hold its place as the flagship of the digital asset market, showing resilience despite global uncertainty. If bullish momentum returns, BTC could target the $260,000 mark by 2027. Meanwhile, Ozak AI stands out as one of the fastest-growing presale projects of 2025, driven by innovation, strong community backing, and expanding partnerships. While the upside potential is immense, investors should always weigh the risks that come with early-stage tokens. Both assets showcase the contrasting sides of the crypto market — Bitcoin’s long-term stability and Ozak AI’s speculative growth potential — offering different paths to potentially significant returns over the next two years.

As we approach the end of 2025, Bitcoin's price hovers around $110,000 to $115,000, with fluctuations influenced by global economic conditions and market sentiment. Despite a recent peak over $125,000, Bitcoin has seen some consolidation. This is typical after a surge as investors take profits and the market adjusts. The stability of Bitcoin's price around the $110,000 mark is supported by both the 200-day and 50-day Simple Moving Averages, indicating a strong bullish trend beneath temporary volatilities. Could Bitcoin Hit $260K by 2027? With institutional investors continuing to show interest and the upcoming halving event, predictions are optimistic. Analysts are eyeing a potential rise to $260,000 by 2027, which would signify a 140% increase from its current valuation. Such growth is anticipated to follow historical patterns seen in past halving cycles, where Bitcoin has experienced substantial bull runs. Ozak AI: A New Contender with High Potential While Bitcoin continues its steady journey, a new player, Ozak AI, has emerged, capturing the attention of the market with its novel integration of AI and blockchain technology. Ozak AI aims to revolutionize market analytics through its advanced Prediction Agents and real-time data processing network. The project's ambitious roadmap includes increasing the value of its $OZ token , which has already seen significant gains in its presale phase. With a current phase price of $0.012 and targets set towards a $1.00 listing, early investors are looking at potentially lucrative returns. Investment Insights and Market Predictions The speculative nature of Ozak AI contrasts sharply with Bitcoin's established market presence. However, both present unique opportunities for investors. For those looking towards the new and potentially high-reward ventures, Ozak AI offers a compelling case, especially with its strategic partnerships and innovative market solutions. Market Dynamics and Analytical Tools The broader cryptocurrency market remains a complex landscape. Technical indicators for Bitcoin suggest a relatively stable market momentum, with key support at around $108,000 and resistance near $118,000. A break above these levels could prompt a retest of its all-time high. In terms of tools and insights, Ozak AI's platform is designed to equip traders with the necessary resources to navigate this volatility. By leveraging AI-driven analytics, users gain access to predictive insights that are crucial in making informed trading decisions. The Road Ahead As we look towards 2026-2027, both Bitcoin and emerging projects like Ozak AI outline the dual nature of the crypto market's evolution: the stability and growth potential of established coins versus the dynamic, high-gain possibilities of new technologies. Investors and enthusiasts will need to navigate these waters carefully, balancing risk and reward in their cryptocurrency ventures.

The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with speculation about a potential Bitmain ETH purchase involving 23,521 Ethereum tokens. This substantial transaction, reported by Onchain-Lens, has sent ripples through the crypto community and raised important questions about institutional involvement in the Ethereum ecosystem. What Does the Bitmain ETH Purchase Mean for Crypto Markets? Onchain-Lens recently detected a significant transaction where a new wallet received 23,521 ETH from BitGo. Blockchain analysts suspect this wallet belongs to Bitmain, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency mining hardware manufacturers. This potential Bitmain ETH purchase represents approximately $40 million at current prices, making it a noteworthy institutional move. The transaction timing raises several questions. Why would a mining hardware company make such a substantial Ethereum acquisition? Industry experts suggest several possible motivations: Diversification beyond Bitcoin mining operations Strategic positioning for Ethereum’s upcoming upgrades Hedging against market volatility Preparing for new mining opportunities How Significant is This Ethereum Transaction? The scale of this suspected Bitmain ETH purchase cannot be overlooked. With 23,521 Ethereum tokens changing hands, this represents one of the larger institutional moves in recent months. The transaction occurred through BitGo, a trusted cryptocurrency custodian known for serving institutional clients. This development comes at a crucial time for Ethereum. The network continues to evolve post-Merge, with staking becoming increasingly important. A major Bitmain ETH purchase could signal growing confidence in Ethereum’s long-term value proposition among hardware manufacturers. What Are the Broader Implications for Ethereum? When industry leaders like Bitmain make substantial Ethereum acquisitions, the entire market takes notice. This potential Bitmain ETH purchase suggests several key trends in the cryptocurrency space.

It demonstrates how established industry players are adapting to market changes and exploring new opportunities. While the transaction’s exact purpose remains unclear, its scale and timing suggest strategic planning rather than casual investment. As the situation develops, market participants should monitor how this suspected Bitmain ETH purchase influences both Ethereum’s price action and broader institutional adoption trends. Such moves often precede wider market shifts and can provide valuable insights for informed decision-making. Frequently Asked Questions How was the Bitmain ETH purchase discovered? Onchain-Lens detected the transaction through blockchain analysis, noting that a new wallet received 23,521 ETH from BitGo, with patterns suggesting Bitmain’s involvement.

Solana’s US spot ETF debut drew solid inflows despite price noise, hinting at stickier demand beneath the volatility. XRP’s structure is tightening as ETF filings progress, creating a catalyst-rich window for breakout trades. PepeNode couples mine-to-earn gameplay with triple-digit staking and clear pricing, aiming to tap into the utility and P2E altcoin niche. Momentum has shifted back to risk-on as discussions intensify about a potential rally in blue-chip altcoins. Yahoo Finance outlines why Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and XRP could soon catch a strong tailwind, with Bitcoin reclaiming the $106K area and pulling market sentiment along. That kind of weekly setup tends to draw liquidity into the rest of the stack when it remains in place. For traders watching breadth, the message is simple: volatility is handing you pockets of opportunity. If $BTC firming is the first domino, rotation is the sequel. Solana’s spot ETF debut has already attracted real inflows, even as the price wobbled, which is evidence that sticky institutional demand is forming beneath the surface. That matters because durable flows help define floors, and floors are where new breakouts begin. XRP’s story is more event-driven. Recent news of the XRPC ETF has rekindled risk-on market sentiment following a formal filing window. The market structure could soon respond with rising volume and cleaner, higher highs. With ETF filings entering a key 20-day review window, traders are positioning for potential headlines that could spark another leg up. $XRP is already showing renewed momentum, with volume and wallet activity climbing as institutional interest builds. If that strength continues, the setup could turn into a breakout phase where rising demand feeds on itself, a classic momentum squeeze. In markets like this, catalysts and positioning often create their own fuel for the move. And if altcoin leaders punch higher together, the alt beta usually follows in their wake. That’s why retail traders are hunting early-stage narratives with attractive utility and incentives. Enter PepeNode ($PEPENODE) , a mine-to-earn spin on meme culture that’s trying to keep users busy rather than passive while the market sorts itself out. Many early adopters see $PEPENODE as one of the best cryptos to watch in 2025 thanks to its $2.1M+ presale, upcoming P2E game, and its real holder rewards. PepeNode ($PEPENODE) — Mine-to-Earn Gameplay Turning Idle Time into Rewards PepeNode ’s premise is direct. You don’t need to rack up your energy bill for a chance to earn some free crypto on the side. Swap those racks of GPUs for a browser-based ‘virtual mining’ simulator where you buy miner nodes, upgrade facilities, and watch a dashboard track hashrate, energy, and rewards. This is an Ethereum meme coin, so the point isn’t proof-of-work; it’s participation and community building. The project’s whitepaper sets a post-TGE platform rollout with the full stack — in-game node purchases and a top score leaderboard that nudges holders to do more than wait for price speculation. The project leans into attractive incentives. Airdrop rewards, such as $PEPE and $FARTCOIN, are front and center, tapping into meme assets that users already understand. These will go towards the top-ranking players once the game hits Ethereum. Meanwhile, the staking rewards (now 613% APY) keep HODLers engaged ahead of the TGE. Small design choice, big impact on retention. These high-stakes rewards will come in handy for game adopters in particular, because $PEPENODE fuels all purchases within the ecosystem. If $PEPENODE keeps building traction through its staking model and play-to-earn rollout after the presale, the current price of $0.0011408 could just be the starting line. With meme-driven hype and gamified engagement already attracting major whale buys , the short-to medium-term $PEPENODE upside potential appears strong. Especially if leaderboard rewards and staking yields keep the community grinding for gains. Check $PEPENODE’s presale today. PepeNode’s Presale Traction Points to Early Hype The PepeNode presale is in full swing, and momentum is visible in the numbers: the current presale price, now at $0.0011408, is set to rise 24 hours from now. With over $2.1M raised so far, $PEPENODE is also not far from its next $2.26M milestone, a tidy signal that retail is showing up even as majors chop. The triple-digit staking is also rare and doing the bootstrapping job it’s meant to do, with over $1.2B tokens staked to date. Early APY figures reached as high as 9000%, but rewards go down as pools fill. As for what’s next, the whitepaper highlights DEX-first listings with a 7.5% liquidity pool. Post-TGE activation of core gameplay comes next. And if the mine-to-earn loop keeps investors engaged, PepeNode could stick around for a while in 2025–2026. Join the presale in four steps following our $PEPENODE buying guide . In a week where $BTC, $SOL, and $XRP all show positive signs, an emerging altcoin that converts attention into action has a chance to catch the bid that follows. Get $PEPENODE and stake for 600% APY.

It has been one of the strongest trends in crypto over the last two months, and it is all driven by a renewed focus on privacy. Zcash’s rise has even made some investors nostalgic for Monero (XMR), which dominated the privacy sector for years. But now, ZEC has taken the lead, recently crossing a $10 billion market cap. Source: ZEC Price / Coinmarketcap While Zcash’s all-time high price sits at $4,293, its market cap just hit a new record. That gap comes from token unlocks, which increased supply. It is why the price chart still looks attractive to traders, some even calling it the next Bitcoin or saying it could one day surpass it. Could ZEC Overtake Bitcoin? Obviously No The point is not about overtaking Bitcoin’s position, but about the level of hype Zcash has reached. People do not just start calling something “the next Bitcoin” without a reason. At the time of writing, community sentiment is 73% bullish according to CoinMarketCap. This comes during a market where the Fear and Greed Index recently dropped to 20, indicating extreme fear. For people that are skeptical about how quickly this Market can move in very little time, $Zcash is a perfect example. This was a coin that was ""dead"" and pumped 795% in less than two months time. pic.twitter.com/IEUqK2VAzC — Anonymous | Crypto Predictions (@Crypto_Twittier) October 26, 2025 It all seems too good to be true, buy Zcash and wait for the next big candle, right? Wrong. These are usually the moments when traders start second-guessing things. Jan3 CEO and Bitcoin advocate Samson Mow warned Zcash investors to “figure out” their positions on Thursday. Comparing Zcash to Dogecoin, Mow advised holders to use their gains to buy BTC instead. Coming from a Bitcoin maximalist, that might sound biased, but it is exactly why taking a closer look at the technical picture matters right now. Zcash Price Prediction: Another Accumulation Zone Before $1,000? Source: ZECUSD / TradingView Zcash looks like it’s cooling off after a strong run, easing back into what looks like an accumulation zone on the chart. The price has been moving inside a rising channel for a while, and this pullback seems like a normal reset unless it drops below that structure. The RSI sitting near 53 shows momentum has calmed down, but still looks balanced, giving bulls room to regroup and react to Mow’s comments. If ZEC can hold steady between roughly 600 and 500, that range could act as a solid base for the next move up. The next target would be around 750, and if momentum kicks back in, maybe even 1,000. As long as it stays above the lower boundary of the channel, the overall trend stays bullish, and this dip might just be a quick breather before another breakout. Zcash Took Off, but PepeNode Might Fly Higher While Zcash is grabbing headlines, another project is heating up for very different reasons. PepeNode is bringing mining back to life, but this time, it is all virtual. PepeNode is a play-to-earn mining game where anyone can earn crypto without needing real mining rigs or paying sky-high electricity bills. You build and upgrade digital mining setups, buy nodes, and grow your operation to generate PEPENODE tokens. As you level up, you earn rewards in popular meme coins. What makes it stand out is its smart token model. Around 70% of tokens used for upgrades get burned permanently, keeping supply tight and adding long-term value for holders. Even before launch, players can already stake their tokens and earn a massive 613% APY . It feels like early Bitcoin mining, but easier to join, fully virtual, and designed for everyone. PepeNode has already raised over 2.10 million dollars, and you can jump in using ETH, BNB, USDT, or even a credit card.

Large-scale blockchain adoption is approaching. Maxwell Stein from BlackRock declared that Ripple’s infrastructure could move trillions of dollars on-chain, signaling institutional readiness for major adoption. Institutional Validation Reaches New Heights Coin Bureau highlighted Stein’s remarks on X, emphasizing that the market is prepared for large-scale blockchain adoption. BlackRock’s support signals a shift from experimental interest to serious financial engagement. Ripple’s technology, especially the XRP Ledger and RippleNet, is now in the spotlight of institutional investors. BLACKROCK BULLISH ON RIPPLE!

With XRP’s institutional sales previously regulated, Ripple now enjoys a clearer path for adoption. This alignment encourages large financial players to consider Ripple for on-chain settlements. Ripple’s Institutional Use Case Ripple’s network is built for speed , compliance, and scalability—traits vital for institutional adoption. RippleNet’s partnerships and cross-border settlement ambitions make it a leader in bridging traditional finance and blockchain.

We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Implications for XRP Holders BlackRock’s interest strengthens XRP’s institutional narrative. Broader adoption could increase demand, improve liquidity, and position XRP as a key settlement token. However, success depends on regulatory stability, partner adoption, and seamless deployment of Ripple’s infrastructure. Institutional interest alone does not guarantee immediate price impact. Future Outlook Ripple’s next phase focuses on infrastructure and adoption rather than speculation. Key questions remain: Will XRPL handle massive flows efficiently? Can Ripple expand compliant, cross-border solutions? Will other institutional players follow BlackRock’s lead? Positive answers could transform XRP’s market role. In conclusion, BlackRock’s endorsement , emphasized by Maxwell Stein, signals a shift in institutional sentiment. With regulatory clarity and robust infrastructure, XRP is positioned for large-scale adoption. The focus now moves from “if” to “when” and “how,” with the world watching closely.

This decisive action could determine whether the government avoids a damaging shutdown that would affect millions of citizens and disrupt essential services nationwide. Why Is This Temporary Budget Vote So Critical? The temporary budget vote represents a crucial stopgap measure to keep the federal government operational. According to Wall Street Journal reports, Speaker Johnson has communicated to Republican colleagues his intention to hold this vital vote on Wednesday. The timing is absolutely essential because without this temporary funding, numerous government agencies would face immediate shutdown. This temporary budget legislation must clear multiple hurdles quickly. First, it needs House approval, then Senate passage, and finally presidential signature. The compressed timeline creates significant pressure on all parties involved to reach consensus and avoid the consequences of a government closure. What Are the Immediate Impacts of This Temporary Budget Decision? The success or failure of this temporary budget vote carries substantial real-world implications. Consider these key areas affected: Federal employees would face furloughs or delayed paychecks Government services including national parks and passport processing could halt Economic stability could be threatened by market uncertainty Military operations might experience funding disruptions The temporary nature of this solution means it only provides short-term relief. However, it creates essential breathing room for lawmakers to negotiate longer-term funding agreements without the immediate threat of government closure. What Challenges Could Derail the Temporary Budget Vote? Several obstacles could complicate Wednesday’s planned temporary budget vote. Political divisions within both parties often surface during budget negotiations. Some lawmakers may demand policy concessions in exchange for their support, while others might oppose temporary measures in favor of comprehensive solutions. The Senate presents another potential hurdle. Even if the House passes the temporary budget, Senate approval isn’t guaranteed. Bipartisan support becomes necessary in the upper chamber, requiring negotiation and compromise across party lines. How Does This Temporary Budget Vote Affect You? While Washington politics might seem distant, this temporary budget vote directly impacts American citizens. Government shutdowns disrupt services people rely on daily. Tax refund processing slows, small business loan approvals stall, and federal contractor payments get delayed. Moreover, the uncertainty created by budget battles can affect economic confidence. Businesses may delay investments during periods of government instability, potentially slowing job growth and economic expansion. What Happens After the Temporary Budget Vote? Assuming the temporary budget passes, lawmakers gain additional time—typically several weeks—to negotiate full-year funding legislation. This breathing room allows for more thorough consideration of spending priorities and policy riders. However, it also means facing another potential shutdown threat when the temporary funding expires. The pattern of temporary budgets has become increasingly common in recent years, reflecting the challenges of reaching long-term budget agreements in a divided political landscape. Conclusion: A Critical Moment for Government Functionality The upcoming temporary budget vote represents more than just procedural politics—it’s about maintaining basic government operations that millions of Americans depend on. Speaker Johnson’s push for Wednesday action demonstrates recognition of the urgent timeline. While temporary solutions aren’t ideal, they prevent the severe disruptions of government shutdowns. As Wednesday approaches, all eyes will be on Capitol Hill to see if lawmakers can set aside differences long enough to keep the government running. The outcome will reveal much about Washington’s ability to perform its most fundamental duty: funding the operations that serve the American people. Frequently Asked Questions What is a temporary budget vote? A temporary budget vote approves short-term government funding to avoid shutdowns while lawmakers negotiate longer-term spending bills. Why is the Wednesday deadline important? Wednesday represents the last practical day for Congress to pass temporary funding before some government agencies exhaust their current budgets. What happens if the temporary budget fails? Government shutdown begins, furloughing non-essential federal employees and suspending many government services. How long does temporary funding last? Typically 2-6 weeks, providing time for Congress to pass full-year appropriations bills. Can the President veto a temporary budget? Yes, though unlikely as it would guarantee immediate government shutdown. What services continue during shutdowns? Only essential services like national security, air traffic control, and border protection continue operating. Found this breakdown of the critical temporary budget vote helpful?

And yes, the opportunity piece is where Little Pepe comes in, because right now its presale price is $0.0022, and investors are looking at a potential gain of 36% or more if it lists at $0.0030 (early-stage investors are already up about 120%). This represents a compelling upside. So let’s walk through three tokens you might consider: one established infrastructure player, one full-on growth engine, and this meme-meets-utility wildcard. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): the meme chain with teeth The team estimates that almost $27.4 million has been raised thus far for Little Pepe, which is presently in presale at $0.0022 (Stage 13). 16.6 billion of the 100 billion tokens were sold. Early-stage investors are already up 120%. The current stage still offers about 36.36% upside if listing occurs at $0.0030. Additionally, Little Pepe is now listed on CoinMarketCap, has been audited by CertiK, and the team is running a $777,000 giveaway, along with a Mega Giveaway of over 15 ETH for top presale buyers (Stages 12-17). Furthermore, during June-August 2025, the meme-coin search volume for LILPEPE peaked above even DOGE and SHIB, according to ChatGPT question-trend data, which indicates that such social momentum matters. In a world where community counts, hype converts and timing matters, Little Pepe gives you the asymmetric play. LILPEPE could climb 45 times above $0.0022, reaching $0.099 by the end of 2025. Ripple (XRP): the payments engine At the time of writing, the price of XRP is about $2.78. Analysts are talking about breakout potential toward $20 and even beyond in the next cycle. What I like about XRP is that it offers a grounding effect in your portfolio. With global payments, remittances and institutional flow in view, it’s not just speculation. It’s the kind of token you hold so you’re not “all in” on hype. Cardano (ADA): the smart-contract researcher Then you’ve got Cardano. The price of ADA is currently approximately $0.90. No, it’s not at its peak, but that’s exactly where the room for expansion is. Analysts anticipate a 100-150% upside in specific scenarios. Cardano is built on solid research, proof-of-stake and broad utility ambitions. Currently, with global macro clouds looming (inflation worries, interest-rate shifts), having ADA gives you exposure to an ecosystem rather than just a single use case. If the altcoin season returns, it could benefit. Conclusion So when you imagine your diversified portfolio in 2025: hold XRP for stability and infrastructure momentum, hold ADA for smart-contract ecosystem growth, and carve out a small slice for Little Pepe as the high-upside play (remember its presale price is $0.0022 and you’re looking at 36% gain potential to $0.0030 or more). To be honest, in today’s world of economic uncertainty, regulatory shifts and social media-driven trends, blending utility with wildcards makes sense. XRP gives you the bedrock. ADA gives you the growth engine. Little Pepe gives you the sprint.

The upward revision reflects confidence in the earnings power of large-cap companies and a tech sector that continues to drive the bulk of corporate profits. The bank now projects 14.4% earnings growth for the S&P 500 in 2026, with nearly half of that growth coming from tech alone. UBS said the market is still being pushed by AI momentum, but noted that other sectors may soon begin contributing. The firm sees a transition ahead, where capital spending starts to spread beyond tech. “We expect capex to eventually widen out of the narrow tech sector and growth to become more broad-based,” the report said. The bank warned that the next four to five months may bring a soft patch as tariffs impact prices, but expects global growth to bounce as consumer confidence improves and rates fall. UBS sees U.S. growth betting entirely on AI UBS called U.S. growth “essentially one big bet on AI,” pointing out that most current investment is focused on technology and data infrastructure. That view has support across Wall Street. Multiple economists have credited the AI boom with keeping the U.S. economy above water, even as rates remain elevated and trade tensions persist under the current administration. UBS estimated capital expenditures linked to AI added 78 basis points to GDP growth in the first half of the year. When including spending on software, R&D, and related areas, that figure jumps to 1.4 percentage points. UBS described those numbers as “eye-watering,” and compared them to the massive tech buildout of the late 1990s, when investment in computers, software, and internet infrastructure helped launch a decade of rising productivity and expanding profits. The bank argued that the same dynamic could be unfolding again, only this time with AI and semiconductors at the core. Meanwhile, Citi has increased its price target for Nvidia ahead of the company’s third-quarter report due November 19. The bank now sees shares at $220, up from $210, and maintains its buy rating. Analyst Atif Malik expects Nvidia to post $56.8 billion in sales, above Wall Street’s $54.6 billion estimate. “We revise our Oct-Q estimates by +11% following stronger-than-expected AI investments showcased by NVDA’s announcement of already reaching 6M units of Blackwell,” Malik wrote. Malik also raised his projection for the 2028 data center semiconductor market, now expecting a total addressable size of $654 billion, up from $563 billion. He wrote that Nvidia is likely to beat expectations again. “We expect ‘beat and raise’ Oct-Q results on 11/19. We model Oct-Q sales of $57B above Street ~$55B and expect Jan-Q guide of $62B vs Street ~$61B,” he added. Malik also said Nvidia’s price-to-earnings ratio of 28x looks cheap compared to AI peers like Broadcom and AMD, which trade at 38x and 37x, respectively. UBS plays down fears of bubble risk Some investors have raised concerns about whether the current AI-driven rally is sustainable, with valuations already sitting near 22 times forward earnings, far above the five-year average. UBS pushed back on bubble fears. “The drama of a bubble inflating and exploding isn’t inevitable,” the bank wrote. “We could just see the market rising strongly in 2026 and then stalling in 2027. The key is to monitor the passthrough of AI productivity to non-tech companies.” UBS made clear that its bullish S&P 500 outlook isn’t based on valuation multiples rising. The bank expects corporate profits and productivity gains to carry the next leg of the market.

Dogecoin, once the unstoppable meme leader, is losing market share to newer, faster-moving meme currencies that could outperform it in the next great rise. DOGE is struggling, but Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , Bonk (BONK), and Pump. fun (PUMP) is leading the way. Each has viral momentum and distinct attributes that could make them explosive upside potential in the next meme wave. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): layer-2 meme machine about to explode Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is the only 2025 meme coin that combines blockchain innovation with the culture of memes. In Stage 13 of its presale at $0.0022 per token, the project has raised $27.3 million and sold 16.6 billion tokens, making it one of the most successful meme presales of the year. Little Pepe is being constructed on a meme-specific Layer 2 blockchain, unlike Dogecoin, which is a solo currency with limited development prospects. Zero trading tax, sniper-bot resistance, ultra-low gas fees, and a Meme Launchpad enable the development and exchange of future meme coins on Little Pepe. Community energy and real-world infrastructure distinguish Little Pepe. The CertiK-audited, CoinMarketCap-listed project plans two major centralized exchange (CEX) listings after the presale. Two large campaigns, a $777,000 Giveaway and a Mega Giveaway worth over 15 ETH, reward presale participants between Stages 12 and 17. LILPEPE might be the next 100x meme coin if it hits exchanges, analysts say, with early investors up 120% and current purchases up 36%. Indeed, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is a movement, not merely a meme. Dogecoin’s chart displays cautions, but LILPEPE’s meme energy and infrastructure power could lead to a 2025 breakout. Bonk (BONK): Solana’s comeback meme token Bonk (BONK), “the Dogecoin of Solana,” shows it’s still going strong. After a 34% drop earlier in the month, BONK rose almost 8% in 24 hours to $0.000015. What drives this revival? An ideal blend of basics and community service. Bonk developers completed a $27.3 million repurchase. fun, reducing supply, and token circulation. Meanwhile, Solana’s ecosystem is strengthening, with network activity and NFT volume rising and meme tokens like BONK being boosted. BONK’s market cap is approaching $1.5 billion, and Solana’s Q4 performance suggests the next leg up might target $0.00003–$0.00005. BONK is a good Dogecoin alternative for traders seeking a meme coin with excellent liquidity, an active development team, and a strong community. BONK has deep roots in Solana dApps and NFT marketplaces, and with DOGE losing prominence, it could lead the next meme wave. Pump.fun (PUMP): high-risk, high-reward traders’ wild card Pump.fun (PUMP) is a trendy meme coin for those seeking volatility. A decentralized meme coin launch and trading system allowed anyone to “pump” meme tokens into existence, boosting the project. Even if the market is cautious, PUMP has seen liquidity and trading activity. It mimics the virality of crypto social media by leveraging the same speculative behavior that made Dogecoin and PEPE famous in a self-sustaining, gamified manner. Pump.fun remains a top social token in user engagement and transaction count, according to current data. Analysts note its unique strategy, where trade and user-created token launches directly drive ecosystem value. It has a larger risk than LILPEPE and BONK, but the reward is clear. If the next meme coin rally looks like early 2021, PUMP could yield outsized profits, making it a favorite among aggressive traders seeking short-term spikes and viral momentum. Dogecoin weakens, but meme coin cycle continues Dogecoin’s chart is gloomy, yet the meme coin cycle continues. This is the progress of meme culture, not its demise. Little Pepe, Bonk, Pump. We are applying insights from meme coins to tokenomics, blockchain infrastructure, and community incentives. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) leads with a validated audit, a significant presale nearing completion, and a Layer 2 ecosystem for long-term growth. BONK benefits from Solana’s revival, and Pump.fun reflects the contagious, speculative character of meme culture. These smarter, faster, and community-focused meme initiatives may lead the next bull cycle as Dogecoin loses market share. Three meme coins to watch for traders positioning themselves for the next rise.

The Polymarket prediction market is currently making waves with its latest revelation: an 84% probability that the U.S. government shutdown will end this week. This remarkable figure demonstrates the growing power of crowd wisdom in predicting real-world outcomes. What Exactly is the Polymarket Prediction Market? The Polymarket prediction market operates as a decentralized platform where users can trade shares based on the likelihood of specific events occurring. Unlike traditional polling methods, prediction markets aggregate collective intelligence through real-money trading. When traders buy and sell shares based on their beliefs about future events, the market prices reflect the crowd’s consensus probability. This approach often proves more accurate than conventional forecasting methods. The current 84% odds on Polymarket suggest strong confidence among traders that congressional leaders will reach a funding agreement. The platform has gained significant traction for its ability to provide real-time insights into various global events. Why Are Prediction Markets Gaining Popularity? Prediction markets offer several distinct advantages over traditional forecasting methods. They provide continuous updates as new information emerges, creating dynamic probability assessments that reflect changing circumstances. Real-time accuracy : Markets adjust instantly to breaking news Financial incentives : Traders have money at stake, promoting careful analysis Diverse perspectives : Global participants contribute unique insights Transparent data : All trading activity remains publicly visible The Polymarket prediction market specifically has become a go-to source for political prognosticators seeking unfiltered market signals about government actions and policy outcomes. How Does This Impact Everyday Americans? While prediction markets might seem like abstract financial instruments, their forecasts carry real-world implications. An end to the government shutdown means federal employees would receive back pay, national parks would reopen, and essential services would resume normal operations. The high probability reading on Polymarket suggests market participants expect swift congressional action. This confidence could influence business decisions, financial planning, and public expectations about government functionality. Moreover, it demonstrates how decentralized platforms can provide valuable insights into traditional political processes. What Makes Polymarket Different From Traditional Betting? Unlike conventional sports betting or casino games, prediction markets like Polymarket serve as information aggregation mechanisms rather than pure gambling platforms. The primary value lies in the market’s ability to synthesize dispersed knowledge into actionable probability estimates. Information focus : Designed to reveal collective wisdom Regulatory status : Operates in a legal gray area using cryptocurrency Global accessibility : Available to users worldwide Multiple outcomes : Covers diverse topics beyond sports The Polymarket prediction market continues to push boundaries in how we understand and forecast complex political developments. The Future of Prediction Markets in Politics As platforms like Polymarket gain mainstream attention, their influence on political discourse and decision-making continues to grow. These markets provide an alternative to traditional media narratives and expert opinions, offering raw, unfiltered probability assessments based on collective trading activity. The current 84% probability reading represents more than just a number—it signifies a shift in how we approach political forecasting. By leveraging decentralized technology and global participation, prediction markets create transparent mechanisms for understanding likely outcomes in an increasingly complex world. Frequently Asked Questions How accurate are Polymarket predictions? Polymarket and similar prediction markets have demonstrated strong accuracy across various event types, often outperforming traditional polling and expert analysis due to their real-time nature and financial incentives. Can anyone participate in Polymarket? Yes, Polymarket is accessible globally, though users must navigate cryptocurrency requirements and ensure compliance with local regulations regarding prediction markets. What happens if the shutdown doesn’t end this week? If the event doesn’t occur as predicted, traders who bought ‘Yes’ shares would lose their investment, while ‘No’ shareholders would profit, demonstrating the financial consequences of inaccurate predictions. Are prediction markets legal? The legal status varies by jurisdiction. Polymarket operates using cryptocurrency, which creates regulatory complexities different from traditional betting markets. How do prediction markets differ from stock markets? While both involve trading, prediction markets focus specifically on event outcomes with binary results, whereas stock markets represent ownership in ongoing enterprises.

Market sentiment has been buoyed by reports that Washington was close to resolving the ongoing government shutdown. According to reports, the Senate has advanced a 60-vote deal to reopen the central government, with the proposal already sent to the House and President Trump for approval. The agreement funds government operations through January 2026, reverses certain employee firings, secures SNAP benefits through the 2026 fiscal year, and sets up a vote on the Affordable Care Act subsidies. The relief saw the cryptocurrency market respond positively as investors began rotating capital. As a result, Bitcoin (BTC) overcame its sluggish weekend to make a strong recovery and cross $106,000. The flagship cryptocurrency was trading around $102,000 over the weekend. However, sentiment picked up as Asian markets opened for the week. As a result, BTC registered a sharp jump, crossing $105,000 to its current level. BTC is up over 4% in the past 24 hours, trading around $106,139. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) has registered an even bigger rally. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency has regained $3,600 and is up nearly 6%, trading around $3,605. Ripple (XRP) is up almost 8%, while Solana (SOL) is up 6%, trading around $167. Dogecoin (DOGE) is also in positive territory, while Cardano (ADA) is up over 6%, trading at $0.588. Chainlink (LINK) is up almost 7%, while Stellar (XLM) is up 6%. Hedera (HBAR) , Litecoin (LTC) , Toncoin (TON) , and Polkadot (DOT) have also registered substantial price increases. Trump Media Posts Q3 Loss Trump Media and Technology Group reported a $55 million loss in its third-quarter earnings, as its Bitcoin (BTC) holdings were not enough to prop up its balance sheet. The company, which operates the Truth Social platform, disclosed that its Q3 net loss increased substantially from the $19.3 million in losses recorded in Q3 2024. The company also reported a marginal decline in revenue, which fell from over $1 million a year ago to $972,900. Trump Media shares also ended Friday down 1.73% at $13.10. Trump Media reported that it held 11,542 Bitcoin (BTC) as of September 30. The company first announced its intention to begin buying BTC in late July, flagging plans to acquire more, along with similar cryptocurrencies. The company generated $15.3 million of realized income from its Bitcoin options investment, posting $33 million in unrealized gains from its Cronos holdings. Senate Cuts Deal To End US Shutdown The cryptocurrency market could soon heave a sigh of relief after the US Senate reached an agreement on Sunday on a three-part budget deal to end the ongoing government shutdown. According to reports, the Senate passed the bills in a 60-40 vote on Sunday night. The agreement was Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune’s 15th attempt to secure Democratic support for a House-approved bill. The vote could potentially end the longest government shutdown as early as this week. The uncertainty over the shutdown and when the US government would resume key services has been a key factor behind BTC’s sluggish price action. It has also impacted the broader crypto market. The flagship cryptocurrency initially rallied to a new all-time high following the shutdown, but has struggled to regain momentum and fell below $100,000 last week. Circle Set To Release Earnings Report Several companies in the crypto ecosystem, including Coinbase and Robinhood, have posted strong results. Now, Circle, the entity behind USDC, is set to release its results this week. The results come at a time when the stock has plunged over 65% from its all-time high. Circle’s stock has struggled in recent months as investor enthusiasm dwindled. Additionally, USDC growth has also stalled, with the stablecoin’s market capitalization stationary around $75 billion. According to Artemis data, transaction volume declined 24% to $2.4 trillion over the past 30 days. Meanwhile, the number of addresses fell 6% to $13.2 million, and transactions recorded an 8% decline. Trump Announces Possible Tariff Dividend US President Donald Trump announced on Sunday that most Americans will receive a $2,000 “dividend” from revenues collected through tariffs. Trump reiterated that the Executive Branch has full authority to impose tariffs on other countries, while floating a possible dividend on Truth Social. “We are taking in trillions of dollars and will soon begin paying down our enormous debt — $37 trillion. Record Investment in the USA, plants and factories going up all over the place. A dividend of at least $2000 a person, not including high-income people, will be paid to everyone.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has started the week on a bullish note as markets recovered, thanks to progress in ending the ongoing government shutdown. The flagship cryptocurrency started the weekend in positive territory, rising nearly 2% on Friday. However, selling pressure returned on Saturday as BTC fell 0.97% to $102,285. Positive sentiment returned on Sunday as BTC rose over 2% to end the weekend at $106,199. The price is up over 1% during the ongoing session, trading around $106,220. Market analysts highlighted that BTC’s weekly close was extremely significant, marking the $103.5 level as critical. Trader Titan of Crypto noted, “Key level of the week: $103,500. A weekly close below isn’t dramatic, but a confirmed breakdown next week would signal the bull market is likely over. Not there yet.” Other traders highlighted a close above the 50-week EMA, stating that a weekly close below this level could put the bull market in jeopardy. Trader Max Crypto stated, “We don’t want a weekly close below this at any cost.” While traders are wishing for a strong recovery, one analyst has warned that BTC reaching $250,000 this year could be “one of the worst things” to happen. According to the macro analyst, BTC reaching $250,000 too quickly could lead to a “blow-off top” moment, with investors scrambling to secure profits. Macro analyst and investor Mel Mattison stated in an interview with Anthony Pompliano, “One of the worst things that could happen is Bitcoin shoots up to $250,000, and the S&P to 8,000 in like 3 months. And you get this blow-off top, and everybody rushes to the exits to take profits, and it starts going down.” Mattison believes BTC is having healthy rotations, with the price action reaching some interesting points. “We’re having healthy rotations, healthy movement, and we are getting some very interesting points at some of the channels that I look at.” BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes and BitMine Chairman Tom Lee recently reiterated a bullish outlook for Bitcoin, suggesting the flagship cryptocurrency could yet reach $250,000 before the end of the year. November has historically been the highest-performing month on average for Bitcoin, with average returns of around 42%. At current prices, this would put BTC around $145,000 by the end of the month, aligning with Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg’s prediction that BTC could reach $140,000-$150,000 by the end of the year before entering a bear market in 2026. However, the market is divided about a bearish 2026. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan believes 2026 will be another up year for BTC. BTC started the previous weekend in positive territory, rising 1.15% on Friday and settling at $109,555. Price action remained positive on Saturday and Sunday as BTC rose 0.45% and 0.44% to cross $110,000 and settle at $110,536. Selling pressure returned on Monday as the price fell nearly 4% and settled at $106,557. The bearish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as BTC slipped below $100,000, falling to a low of $98,892. However, it rebounded from this level to reclaim $100,000 and settle at $101,468. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered on Wednesday, rising over 2% and settling at $103,869. Source: TradingView BTC returned to bearish territory on Thursday, dropping to a low of $100,235 before settling at $101,290. The price slipped below $100,000 again on Friday, falling to a low of $99,170 before recovering and settling at $103,284, ultimately rising nearly 2%. Price action was mixed over the weekend as BTC fell 0.97% on Saturday before rising 2.36% on Sunday and settling at $104,964. BTC has reclaimed $106,000 during the ongoing session, with the price up 1.51% at 106,295. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) recovered over the weekend as bullish sentiment returned, as US lawmakers agreed on a draft that could end the ongoing government shutdown this week. ETH started the weekend positively but lost momentum on Saturday, dropping nearly 1% and settling at $3,401. Bullish sentiment returned on Sunday as ETH rallied, rising over 5% and settling at $3,583. The price has risen almost 1% during the ongoing session, trading around $3,611. According to reports, the Senate advanced a 60-vote cloture deal to reopen the federal government, with the proposal already sent to the House and President Trump for approval. The agreement funds the government through January 30, 2026, and reverses certain employee firings. It also secures SNAP benefits through the 2026 fiscal year, and sets up a December vote on Affordable Care Act subsidies. Analysts believe that while selling pressure has eased, ETH’s recovery could remain limited unless broader market headwinds subside. According to the available on-chain data, there has been a gradual decline in Ethereum outflows over the past few days, suggesting a slowdown in selling activity and a potential stabilization in price. The consistent reduction in exchange outflows indicates cooling bearish sentiment. However, it could also be a pause instead of a complete reversal. Additionally, the drop in selling volume is yet to translate into accumulation. ETH’s RSI paints a cautious picture, with the indicator below the neutral 50 mark. This indicates persistent bearish sentiment despite a rebound from oversold conditions. ETH started the previous week in positive territory, rising 1.14% on Friday. Buyers retained control over the weekend as the price rose 0.67% on Saturday and 0.87% on Sunday to settle at $3,908. However, price action turned bearish on Monday as ETH fell nearly 8% and settled at $3,604. Selling pressure intensified on Tuesday as the price plunged to an intraday low of $3,058. However, it rebounded from this level to reclaim $3,200 and settle at $3,286, ultimately dropping almost 9%. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, ETH recovered on Wednesday, rising over 4% to reclaim $3,400 and settle at $3,424. Source: TradingView Selling pressure returned on Thursday as ETH fell over 3% and settled at $3,313. The price fell to an intraday low of $3,196 on Friday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level to reclaim $3,400 and settle at $3,433, ultimately rising 3.63%. Price action was mixed over the weekend as ETH fell 0.94% on Saturday before rising 5% on Sunday and settling at $3,583. The price is marginally up during the ongoing session, trading around $3,604. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana’s (SOL) ongoing recovery has stalled around the $170 mark. The altcoin started the week in positive territory, rising over 4% on Friday. However, it lost momentum on Saturday, dropping over 2% and settling at $158. Bullish sentiment returned on Sunday as the price rose 4.09% to cross $160 and settle at $164. SOL is up over 1% during the ongoing session, trading around $166. While SOL’s recovery has brought relief to investors, Bitwise’s Solana ETF has given a lot to cheer about. The nascent ETF has recorded over $126 million in net inflows during its first full week of trading. Meanwhile, the Bitwise Solana Staking ETF (BSOL) has generated over $545 million in net inflows since its debut on the NYSE. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley stated on X, “$30,000,000 of inflows into BSOL yesterday. Solana purchased. Inflows every day for the last 8 days since its launch. Over $500,000,000 in total. It’s clear investors want Solana exposure. With BSOL, we’ve aimed to construct a high-quality way for investors to get access: 100% staked, very low fees. Grateful to those entrusting Bitwise to steward their assets.” In comparison, spot Bitcoin ETFs have registered over $2.1 billion in outflows, while Ethereum ETF outflows are around $579 million. SOL started the previous weekend in positive territory, rising 1.34% on Friday and settling at $187. The price fell 0.45% on Saturday before rising 0.76% on Sunday to end the weekend at $187. Selling pressure returned on Monday as SOL fell 11.55% and settled at $166. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as the price fell 6.65% to an intraday low of $145 before settling at $155.

Cardano (ADA) Price Analysis Cardano (ADA) has recovered over the past few days, rising from a low of $0.491 to reclaim $0.50 and moving to $0.561. Despite its recovery, ADA has underperformed its peers, largely due to longstanding concerns around its ecosystem. The Cardano blockchain has a few developers and decentralized applications on its platform, but they have a negligible presence in their respective industries. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson is banking on two major developments to boost the Cardano ecosystem and ADA. The first is the Leios upgrade, which introduces the input, endorsement, and ranking blocks to enable parallel processing. The second is Midnight, a sidechain that will boost the ecosystem’s growth over time. The security-focused sidechain will be a Cardano asset, wholly interoperable with Cardano. According to ADA’s daily chart, the price crashed from a high of over $1 in September to around $0.491, forming an inverse cup and handle, an indication of continued bearish pressure. ADA registered a 1.50% increase on Friday (October 31) and moved to $0.610. The price registered a marginal rise on Saturday and a marginal decline on Sunday, ending the weekend at $0.610. Selling pressure intensified on Monday as ADA fell over 9% and settled at $0.553. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as the price fell 5.61% and settled at $0.522. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, ADA recovered on Wednesday, rising 4.41% and settling at $0.545. Source: TradingView ADA lost momentum on Thursday as the price fell 2,39% and settled at $0.532. The price recovered on Friday, rising over 8% and settling at $0.576. Price action was mixed over the weekend as ADA fell 1.22% on Saturday and 1.58% on Sunday, settling at $0.578. ADA is up over 2% during the ongoing session, trading around $0.591. Uniswap (UNI) Price Analysis Uniswap (UNI) started the previous weekend in the red, dropping nearly 2% on Friday and settling at $5.741. Sentiment turned positive over the weekend as UNI rose over 2% to $5.860. However, it lost momentum on Monday, plunging over 11% and settling at $5.198. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as the price fell 2.46% to a low of $4.735 before reclaiming $5 and settling at $5.070. UNI faced volatility on Wednesday as buyers and sellers struggled to take control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as the price rose by over 5% and settled at $5.347. Source: TradingView Selling pressure returned on Thursday as UNI fell almost 2% and settled at $5.252. Bullish sentiment returned on Friday as UNI rallied, rising nearly 12% and settling at $5.877. Price action remained positive over the weekend as UNI rose 2.21% on Saturday and by over 9% on Sunday, crossing $6 and settling at $6.573. The price is up almost 4% during the ongoing session, trading around $6.823. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

This rally was fueled not only by market conditions but also by the remarkable technical convergence between Starknet and the rising star of recent days, Zcash (ZEC). Chart showing today's rise in STRK price. Zcash, which has surged in recent weeks on strong spot demand, has become a symbol of the structural capital rotation toward privacy-focused projects. While privacy-themed altcoins are outperforming most broad market segments, ZEC's performance is beginning to carry momentum into other ecosystems. The Starknet landscape is equally dynamic. The developer ecosystem has been accelerating ahead of this quarter's protocol updates. The impending launch of a Bitcoin-focused financial platform, in particular, has prompted investors to re-price the project after months of stagnation. Related News: The U.S. Government Shutdown Could End Within the Next Few Hours - Fresh Developments, Here Are the Details Another factor fueling the rally is the possibility of effective connectivity. Starknet co-founder and CEO Eli Ben-Sasson is also among the founding scientists of Zcash. In his latest statement, Ben-Sasson further raised expectations by stating that the two ecosystems could form a joint technical alliance in the future: “As a co-founder of both Zcash and Starknet, I would love to see these two favorite projects of mine form a technical alliance.” This announcement is seen as one of the major catalysts for the sudden buying appetite in Starknet price. The proposal, which has created great excitement in the community, is technically summarized as follows, with the title “Ztarknet, a Starknet-style L2 for Zcash”: Only one, narrowly defined change is being made to the Zcash main chain: the addition of the STARK proof validator. This verifier validates L2 proofs through consensus. This allows Zcash to run a scalable L2 similar to Starknet. While transactions and applications are stored in L2, Zcash simply verifies the proof and accepts the new state root. Privacy and security of value are preserved in L1, while speed and programmability are moved to L2. *This is not investment advice.

Because XRP has had its fair share of peaks and lows, heavy investors are investing their funds in another cryptocurrency, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Currently, the price of Mutuum Finance is only pegged at an affordable price of $0.035, it is the next big crypto with real-world application in the DeFi sphere. The response is clearly having the intended effect, with Presale Stage 6 already over 85% sold out, meaning there is only a limited amount left before the price hike. Investors consider MUTM the top crypto to buy right now and see it as the next big crypto with strong DeFi fundamentals. Ripple’s XRP Lower Due to Pressing Sales The price of XRP has fallen by nearly 5% to 2.23, badly impacted by the massive cryptocurrency liquidation of $1.4 billion. Due to Bitcoin’s fall of 9% in the current week, XRP is also falling, inching closer to the critical support level. The crucial level of support is currently at $2.08, but if broken, the technical pattern indicates the possibility of falling to $1.85, indicating more severe fallouts to follow. Currently, the bearish force is also weak, with traders eagerly waiting to observe if the buying force is able to hold on to the current levels of support. Meanwhile, traders looking for an alternative are also turning their attention to Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Presale is Reaching its Final Stages in Phase 6 due to Increased Demand Mutuum Finance is receiving immense attention across the entire DeFi space, with Phase 6 of its presale reaching close to full capacity. Currently, MUTM tokens are available for the price of $0.035, but investors are left with their last opportunity to invest before the price rises to $0.04 in Phase 7. The platform has quickly made its mark on the list of the most awaited cryptocurrency investments of 2025, having already reached five successful presale phases with each one fully sold out. Over 17,830 investors have already put in over $18.55 million, which indicates immense community faith in the development plans of Mutuum Finance, making MUTM one of the most encouraging cryptos to watch out for before the upcoming market cycle. Mutuum Finance is the top crypto to buy for the upcoming market cycle. The growing demand strongly supports it as the next big crypto. Constructing Stable & Trusted Infrastructure for DeFi Mutuum Finance is gearing up to offer the community its fully collateralized USD stablecoin, which will be the cornerstones of its lending & borrowing platform. The stablecoin will be secured with on-chain validated collateral assets, so there will be clear pricing, along with stable pricing on the platform. Utilizing the stable cryptocurrency will help Mutuum Finance deliver well-stabilized profits with minimum risks to the platform from the volatility linked with lending & borrowing platforms on other blockchain platforms. This is indeed one of the biggest breakthroughs in achieving their aim of offering the much-required scaled & secured decentralized financial platform to the users. This cements MUTM’s stature as one amongst the most promising projects being launched in the DeFi market, even closer to the price move to Phase 7. Mutuum Finance has also exceeded $18.55 million in cumulative contributions with over 17,830 contributors on board, with Phase 6 selling out shortly on the current price of $0.035. Such markers are clear indicators of the extent of international faith in the deliverance of a project pegged on real world application and financial dynamics, apart from mere investment expectations. With its on-chain collateral engine, lending protocols, and upcoming stablecoin, MUTM is on its way to being the future growth cryptocurrency. Getting on board on the current price tag will expose one to the next price movement, in a highly promising growth project realizing real world financial value on the decentralized platform. For many traders evaluating alternatives, MUTM stands out as the top crypto to buy. The project’s growth trajectory confirms it is the next big crypto.

XRP Is In The Strongest Bull Run Ever On the latest 3-month XRP/USD chart from Bitstamp, the in-progress candle shows price around $2.31, with the Ichimoku conversion line and baseline tracking just beneath spot. The analyst highlights that XRP “has never built a base above the 3 month conversion or baseline in its history and it’s doing it now for the past year” (posted Nov. 8, 2025). That observation is notable because, in prior cycles, quarterly closes consistently failed to hold above those Ichimoku reference lines after rallies, whereas the current cycle has seen price stabilize on top of them for multiple quarters in a row. The present quarterly candle remains open, but the configuration—price above both the 3-month conversion and baseline—visually underscores the claim of an ongoing macro bull trend. And there’s a more bullish structure for XRP. XRP has been oscillating between the 0.886 Fibonacci retracement at $2.25877 and its 2018 cycle all-time high at $3.31700. Since early December last year, price repeatedly defended the $2.25877 band as support while failing to secure acceptance above the $3.31700 ceiling on the weekly chart, creating a horizontal range capped by the former peak. Related Reading: XRP Eyes $5.5, But The Best Entry Is Still Ahead: Analyst “To put things in perspective, XRP has been consolidating between the 0.886 Fibonacci level and its 2018 all-time high (2.25877–3.317). It’s building a strong base above the 0.886 Fib,” Mattsby wrote on Oct. 12, adding that this structure keeps XRP in what he calls a “#Palantiring candidate” posture. Although that remark is four weeks old, the argument remains intact on the posted chart: the 0.886 area continues to function as the pivotal shelf. XRP Price Targets Beyond the prior-cycle high, the same weekly framework maps out upside extension levels that would logically come into play only if $3.31700 is reclaimed and held. Those include the 1.272 extension around $8.29661, the 1.414 near $13.38940, and the 1.618 up at $26.63038. Related Reading: XRP Price To Reach $1,000 By End Of 2025? Rumor Mills Are On Fire With BlackRock Speculations Closer to price, the stacked retracement supports below $2.25877 are clearly demarcated at $1.61246 (0.786), $1.12487 (0.702), $0.91531 (0.618), $0.61495 (0.500), $0.41315 (0.382), and $0.25257 (0.236), delineating the ladder of demand zones that governed XRP’s multi-year range prior to the latest advance. Taken together, the two timeframes tell a coherent story. On the high-timeframe Ichimoku view, XRP is maintaining altitude above its 3-month conversion and baseline for the first sustained period in its history—an objective sign of trend strength. On the weekly, price action has compressed into a well-defined band between $2.26 and $3.32, with repeated mean-reversions indicating accumulation rather than distribution while the market tests overhead supply at the 2018 high. As long as the 0.886 retracement at $2.25877 continues to hold on closing bases, the consolidation thesis laid out by The Great Mattsby—and the characterization of this as XRP’s strongest macro bull trend to date on Ichimoku terms—remains technically valid. At press time, XRP traded at $2.56.

By 2028, AAVE could reach a maximum price of $640.49. In 2031, AAVE will range between $864.66 to $1,040.79. Aave is a decentralized lending protocol on the Ethereum blockchain . It is known for its innovative financial solutions, such as flash loans, which allow users to borrow instantly without collateral, and dynamic interest rates that adapt to market conditions. Participants in the Aave ecosystem can deposit their digital crypto assets back into liquidity pools to earn interest payments or obtain loans by borrowing funds without providing collateral. Aave’s governance and fee distribution are significantly driven by its native token, AAVE, enhancing its utility and value within the platform. Having touched its ATH at $666.86 in May 2021, how much will AAVE be worth in 2025? Is AAVE worth holding? Let’s get into the Aave technical analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Aave Ticker AAVE Current price $217.65 Market cap $3.33B Trading volume (24-h) $463.88M Circulating supply 15.26M AAVE All-time high $666.86 on May 19, 2021 All-time low $26.02 on Nov 5, 2020 24-hour low $224.99 24-hour high $209.33 Aave price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 6.93% (Very High) 50-day SMA $246.02 14-Day RSI 45.19 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 29 (Fear) Green days 14/30 (47%) 200-Day SMA $254.02 Aave 1-day price analysis Key takeaways AAVE shows early bullish momentum, trying to reclaim the $220 zone. The MACD and Alligator lines suggest a possible short-term uptrend continuation. Key supports lie at $212 and $190, while resistance levels at $223–$230 could trigger partial profit-taking. Aave 1-day price chart As of November 10, AAVE is trading at $216.73, up 2.08% today, showing renewed momentum after a multi-day consolidation phase. The price sits just below the Bollinger Band midline at $217.65, signaling that a close above this level could confirm short-term bullish control. The lower band support lies near $189.93, forming a strong cushion for potential dips. The MACD has flipped slightly positive, indicating early bullish divergence, while the RSI remains neutral to slightly oversold. AAVEUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView A clear daily close above $218–$220 could set up a test toward $230 and $245, while rejection here could send the price back to $205 or $190. A clean breakout confirmation above the Bollinger mid-band is needed before entry. Aave 4-hour price chart The 4-hour chart shows a mild retracement after AAVE $220, with the price now at $217.93, slightly below recent highs. The Alligator lines remain positively aligned, confirming that the short-term trend is still bullish, though momentum is pausing. The Balance of Power hints that sellers are momentarily regaining control, while the PVT near 977K remains steady, reflecting continued market participation without major outflows. AAVEUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView If AAVE sustains above $215, the structure favors continuation to $223–$225. A breakdown below $212 could invalidate this bullish setup, exposing $205 as the next key support. Aave technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $244.71 SELL SMA 5 $226.23 SELL SMA 10 $225.71 SELL SMA 21 $223.04 SELL SMA 50 $246.02 SELL SMA 100 $274.29 SELL SMA 200 $254.02 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $226.43 SELL EMA 5 $241.74 SELL EMA 10 $266.00 SELL EMA 21 $285.43 SELL EMA 50 $290.99 SELL EMA 100 $279.93 SELL EMA 200 $258.34 SELL AAVE price analysis conclusion AAVE is transitioning from consolidation to a cautious bullish phase. If buyers maintain pressure above $215–$218, a breakout toward $ 230 or higher is plausible this week. Failure to close above $220, however, could lead to renewed testing of lower supports near $205 before another attempt upward. Is AAVE a good investment? Aave provides the essential infrastructure for lending and borrowing within DeFi, expanding beyond traditional applications into gaming, NFTs, and dApps. AAVE token plays a vital role in powering the platform, making it a strong choice for investors due to its proven market success and continuous development. Where to buy AAVE?

Aave (AAVE) can potentially reach $500 if it breaks through the current resistance levels and gains momentum from positive market sentiment and trends. AAVE had previously reached an ATH of $666.86; attaining $500 should be an achievable feat in the near term if market conditions align. Does Aave have a good long-term future? Aave has proven itself to be one of the most trusted and innovative platforms in DeFi over the years. It’s not just surviving, it’s evolving, with features like the GHO stablecoin and multichain support keeping it ahead of the curve.

His remarks on crypto asset strategy coincided with unexpected investment activity in Bitcoin and XRP. In the interview , Mitchnick discussed BlackRock’s approach to crypto-based exchange-traded funds and the evolving role of major digital assets within institutional portfolios. Following the video’s release, analysts noted unusual inflows and trading patterns in both Bitcoin and XRP. Prob the closest you’ll get to an answer on why BlackRock isn’t going deeper into the coins. Also stresses patience w bitcoin, traders and leveraged bets are almost always gonna underperform the long term ppl, which is a universal truth. https://t.co/OL91lPnMtB — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 10, 2025 The former Ripple executive noted that BlackRock is cautious in the crypto market because most coins are considered worthless. He praised Bitcoin, stating that its dominance demonstrates its enduring value over time. However, X users who have become sensitive to social media videos said that the video is AI-generated. One X user said , “his mouth moves independent of the muscles in his face that surround his mouth, it’s a fake video.” But Eric Bachunas, who re-tweeted the video, assured his followers that the video is authentic. Bitcoin and XRP investors reduce selling Following Mitchnick’s statement that the flows reversed significantly for Bitcoin spot ETFs, there was a noticeable shift in investment behavior. He emphasised at the Token2049 Dubai conference that initial inflows had come heavily from high-net-worth individuals and retail investors. However, the share held by institutional and wealth advisory clients has been increasing recently. Shortly after, reports surfaced of large-scale “in-kind” conversions. According to Mitchnick, more than $3 billion worth of Bitcoin had been moved into BlackRock’s platform via in-kind ETF transactions, allowing holders to convert coins into ETF shares without triggering a sale event. On the other hand, although XRP was not directly commented on by Mitchnick, linking a specific interview to sudden flows, there were signs of unanticipated investment activity in the wake of his remarks. It was mainly linked to institutional crypto adoption being “still early” and that ETFs for XRP were “unconfirmed.” His background working with Ripple has the XRP army high on wishful thinking. XRP whales have now reduced selling, easing $650 million in outflows. Also, new XRP ETF entries were seen on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC). This initiated the 20-day SEC review clock and increased confidence in speculating in the cryptocurrency market. Franklin Templeton, Bitwise, Canary Capital, 21Shares, and CoinShares were all listed on the DTCC. To that end, more investors are adopting a “buy the rumor, sell the news” approach, driven by fears that a significant drop could follow any price rise. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is up 1.1% in the past 24 hours, trading at $105,095. This is a welcome bounce after last week, when the asset dipped below $100,000 multiple times and Bitcoin ETFs saw $1.22 billion in outflows. XRP is also up 9.6% in the last 24 hours, now trading at $2.53. Mitchnick asks new investors to refrain from leveraging According to Mitchnick, new investors should be careful and patient in the crypto markets. He asserts that long-term investors gain more and are more secure than short-term traders who focus on leverage bets. This has been seen mostly in the so-called Uptober that underperformed this year. For instance, one anonymous large trader on Binance, whose BTC-USDT long position was forcibly closed during the rout, reported realized losses of approximately $ 450 million. This was one of the biggest individual liquidations. Another trader is said to have lost over $30 million in about 10 minutes due to cross-margin exposure and rapid price changes. Earlier, as reported by Cryptopolitan, high-leverage crypto trader Wynn took a very large long position of approximately $1.25 billion on Bitcoin with 40× leverage. That position was liquidated when Bitcoin briefly dipped, resulting in a loss of approximately 949 BTC, worth $100 million. Additionally, Wynn placed another leveraged long of approximately $100 million and lost $25 million in a liquidation event. He admitted publicly that his trading had basically become gambling.

The scale of the recovery caught overleveraged traders off guard, wiping short positions as bullish sentiment returned. The flagship cryptocurrency reclaimed $104,000 on Sunday and has crossed $106,000 during the ongoing session, up 1.29% at $106,058. Market Heaves Sigh Of Relief As Shutdown End In Sight The cryptocurrency market could soon heave a sigh of relief after the US Senate reached an agreement on Sunday on a three-part budget deal to end the ongoing government shutdown. According to reports, the Senate passed the bills in a 60-40 vote on Sunday night. The agreement was Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune’s 15th attempt to secure Democratic support for a House-approved bill. The vote could potentially end the longest government shutdown as early as this week. The uncertainty over the shutdown and when the US government would resume key services has been a key factor behind BTC’s sluggish price action. It has also impacted the broader crypto market. The flagship cryptocurrency initially rallied to a new all-time high following the shutdown, but has struggled to regain momentum and fell below $100,000 last week. Trump Media Posts Q3 Loss Despite Bitcoin (BTC) Holdings Trump Media and Technology Group reported a $55 million loss in its third-quarter earnings despite its substantial Bitcoin ( BTC ) holdings. The company, which operates the Truth Social platform, disclosed that its Q3 net loss increased substantially from the $19.3 million in losses recorded in Q3 2024. The company also reported a marginal decline in revenue, which fell from over $1 million a year ago to $972,900. Trump Media shares also ended Friday down 1.73% at $13.10. Trump Media reported that it held 11,542 Bitcoin ( BTC ) as of September 30. The company first announced its intention to begin buying BTC in late July, flagging plans to acquire more, along with similar cryptocurrencies. The company generated $15.3 million of realized income from its Bitcoin options investment, posting $33 million in unrealized gains from its Cronos holdings. Robert Kiyosaki Doubles Down On Bitcoin Bet Renowned author Robert Kiyosaki has doubled down on his bullish outlook for Bitcoin and other hard assets, stating he is buying more gold, silver, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. Kiyosaki warned of an impending economic downturn, adding that he is preparing for it by accumulating assets that he calls “real money.” “Crash coming: Why I am buying, not selling.” Kiyosaki set ambitious price projections, stating Bitcoin will reach $250,000 by 2026, while silver will reach $100, and gold will reach $27,000. Meanwhile, BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes believes the Federal Reserve will be forced into a form of stealth quantitative easing (QE) as government debt skyrockets. Hayes stated the Fed will likely inject liquidity into the financial market through its Standing Repo Facility to help finance Treasury Debt without actually calling it quantitative easing. Strategy Launches Euro-based Preferred Stock Sale Strategy, the world’s largest public Bitcoin treasury, has announced the pricing of its euro-dominated perpetual-preferred stock. The company priced the stock at €80 per share. The sale of the euro-based preferred STRE stock is part of the company’s plan to raise funds for future Bitcoin purchases. According to a statement, the issuance and sale of the STRE stock is expected to close on November 13. Strategy expects gross proceeds of €620 million (or $715 million), while net proceeds should be roughly around €608.8 million ($702 million). The company stated that the net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including the purchase of more Bitcoin. The company announced the purchase of 397 BTC worth $45.6 million on November 3. The purchase was made at an average cost of $114,771 per coin, taking Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to 641,205 BTC . Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin ( BTC ) has started the week on a bullish note as market sentiment has flipped to positive. The flagship cryptocurrency rose nearly 2% on Friday before dropping 0.97% on Saturday and settling at $102,285. Positive sentiment returned on Sunday as the price rose 2.36% to cross $104,000 and settle at $104,694. BTC is up over 2% during the ongoing session, trading around $106,158. While traders are wishing for a strong recovery, one analyst has warned that BTC reaching $250,000 this year could be “one of the worst things” to happen. According to the macro analyst, BTC reaching $250,000 too quickly could lead to a “blow-off top” moment, with investors scrambling to secure profits. Macro analyst and investor Mel Mattison stated in an interview with Anthony Pompliano, “One of the worst things that could happen is Bitcoin shoots up to $250,000, and the S&P to 8,000 in like 3 months. And you get this blow-off top, and everybody rushes to the exits to take profits, and it starts going down.” Mattison believes BTC is having healthy rotations, with the price action reaching some interesting points. “We’re having healthy rotations, healthy movement, and we are getting some very interesting points at some of the channels that I look at.” BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes and BitMine Chairman Tom Lee recently reiterated a bullish outlook for Bitcoin, suggesting the flagship cryptocurrency could yet reach $250,000 before the end of the year. November has historically been the highest-performing month on average for Bitcoin, with average returns of around 42%. Meanwhile, blockchain data has revealed the Bitcoin whales dumping BTC and crashing the price. Several high-profile entities, including the Winklevoss Twins’ Gemini Custody wallets and early Bitcoin miner Owen Gunden, have emerged as key players influencing the flagship cryptocurrency’s price action. According to blockchain data, wallets linked to Winklevoss Capital and Gemini Custody have been methodically transferring large quantities of Bitcoin. The transfers have occurred in phases and involve several timed transactions. If the transactions correspond to sales, it means the Winklevoss twins have been methodically offloading their assets. The Winklevoss twins have liquidated over 9,000 BTC , worth around $900 million, since the beginning of 2025. BTC started the previous weekend in positive territory, rising 1.15% on Friday and settling at $109,555. Price action remained positive on Saturday and Sunday as BTC rose 0.45% and 0.44% to cross $110,000 and settle at $110,536. Selling pressure returned on Monday as the price fell nearly 4% and settled at $106,557. The bearish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as BTC slipped below $100,000, falling to a low of $98,892. However, it rebounded from this level to reclaim $100,000 and settle at $101,468. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered on Wednesday, rising over 2% and settling at $103,869. Source: TradingView BTC returned to bearish territory on Thursday, dropping to a low of $100,235 before settling at $101,290. The price slipped below $100,000 again on Friday, falling to a low of $99,170 before recovering and settling at $103,284, ultimately rising nearly 2%. Price action was mixed over the weekend as BTC fell 0.97% on Saturday before rising 2.36% on Sunday and settling at $104,964. The flagship cryptocurrency has reclaimed $106,000 during the ongoing session, up nearly 2%, trading around $106,296. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

This news was released after Digital Realty Trust Inc., a real estate investment trust that owns, operates, and develops data centers worldwide, mentioned that it applied to construct a data center in 2019. Notably, the company applied to build a data center in Santa Clara, California. Although they applied about six years ago, sources confirmed that the project is still awaiting complete power activation and is currently under development. On the other hand, Stack Infrastructure, which was acquired by Blue Owl Capital Inc. earlier this year, has also revealed a 48-megawatt project that is currently sitting idle. At the same time, Silicon Valley Power, the city-owned utility, works to improve its ability to provide services. The situation surrounding these facilities demonstrates a critical challenge for the US tech industry and the wider economy. This follows a report from analysts highlighting that, although demand for data centers is greater than ever before due to a surge in cloud computing and AI, gaining access to an electricity supply is becoming a significant problem. US firms aim to invest large amounts in new AI infrastructure amid power shortages The power supply issue primarily stems from slow progress on new transmission lines , outdated power infrastructure, and various challenges with regulations and permits. Sources have also pointed out the likelihood that pressure on power systems will escalate. BloombergNEF shared its forecast that US demand for electricity from AI computing could double by 2035. This forecast aligns with the predictions of company executives, such as OpenAI’s Sam Altman and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, who anticipate that trillions of dollars will be invested in building new AI infrastructure . “The demand has reached an all-time high, and we are facing a power-supply issue,” said Bill Dougherty, the executive vice president for data center solutions at real estate firm CBRE Group Inc., during an interview. Meanwhile, in terms of size, the Santa Clara projects are reportedly smaller than those in big facilities that leading AI developers are constructing in New Mexico, Louisiana, Texas, and Pennsylvania. Although these areas have lower electricity costs, their power supply sources are still being developed. The smaller centers serve local cloud clients who pay more for electricity and real estate, thereby reducing delays caused by long-distance data transfers. This is critically important for self-driving car operators and high-frequency traders, who require rapid access to information. Dougherty explained that some types of data center demand must be located near population centers. According to him, this is the kind of demand that needs to be addressed in California. However, he raised concerns that they cannot start up due to the restrictions on the available power supply. Regarding the situation, a May presentation by the city council highlighted that Santa Clara currently has 57 data centers that are either operational or under construction. In an email, utility spokesperson Janine de la Vega mentioned that Silicon Valley Power has contracts with Digital Realty and Stack that outline how they will provide their services. The representative also revealed that they regularly review requests for additional power supply. “SVP is working on a $450 million upgrade to their system to meet the needs of these customers and others. This project is on track to finish by 2028,” she added. The dilemma of power shortage in the US sparks concerns among data center developers Apart from Santa Clara, analysts discovered that many other places are also facing delays due to restrictions on utility capacity. Based on their argument, utilities across the United States have struggled to maintain their pace as the electricity demand grows faster than the power grid can deliver. Last year, Dominion Energy Inc. forecasted that connecting large data centers to the grid would take an additional one to three years, with some projects potentially taking up to seven years. Dominion serves northern Virginia’s Data Center Alley, home to the world’s largest group of computing facilities. In the meantime, Amazon.com Inc. has filed a complaint against a utility owned by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. in Oregon, alleging that the electricity provider has not supplied enough power for four of its data centers.

Bitdeer’s revenue beat was powered by rising Bitcoin prices and a huge increase in its self-mining output, according to the earnings report. Despite the top-line growth, Wall Street didn’t react kindly. Bitdeer’s stock (BTDR) dropped more than 9% on Monday morning, with analysts pointing fingers at a softening in Bitcoin’s price that spooked investor sentiment. Bitdeer also logged a net loss of $266.7 million for the quarter, which is more than five times the $50.1 million loss it posted last year. But the company’s adjusted EBITDA did turn positive, hitting $43 million, which is a complete 180 from the $7.9 million adjusted loss in Q3 2024, thanks to a combination of stronger operational efficiency and higher mining capacity. Bitdeer’s self-mining output surges, cloud contracts phased out Revenue from self-mining alone exploded to $130.9 million, up from $31.5 million a year earlier. Bitdeer mined 1,109 Bitcoins during Q3, more than doubling its 511 BTC output from the same time last year. The company completely wound down its Cloud Hashrate contracts, which used to bring in $7.1 million, and instead reallocated that hardware to its in-house mining fleet, boosting efficiency. As of September 30, Bitdeer held $196.3 million in cash and equivalents, alongside $246.2 million worth of cryptocurrency on its books. But costs followed revenue, so Bitdeer’s operating expenses surged by 41% year-over-year, hitting $60.5 million, as the company scaled up infrastructure. Research and development expenses jumped to $39.1 million, from $24.8 million, due to active work on the SEAL04 chip, Bitdeer’s next-generation ASIC miner. By the end of October, Bitdeer said it had hit 41.2 EH/s (exahash per second) of self-mining capacity, overshooting its 40 EH/s target for the year. Mass production of SEALMINER A3 machines is already underway. But SEAL04 development hit a snag. The company flagged “significant delays” in manufacturing due to design hurdles. Chief Strategy Officer Haris Basit said the delays stem from technical complexities involving both EDA tools and design flows, and added that “we completed the first tape-out in September”. He confirmed that volume production for SEAL04 remains on schedule for Q1 2026, though the version with updated architecture won’t meet its initial launch timeline. GPU rollout builds momentum, data centers break ground Bitdeer is also building out AI data centers beyond crypto. By October, the company had deployed 584 GPUs, pulling in an annualized $8 million in recurring revenue. They’ve already placed orders for NVIDIA’s GB300 and B300 systems, which are expected to arrive in December. The company now controls 1,611 megawatts of energized power capacity spread across Texas, Norway, Bhutan, and Ethiopia, while another 1,381 megawatts are under development. Among the projects in motion: a 221 MW facility in Massillon, Ohio, scheduled to go live in early 2026, and a 570 MW site in Clarington, Ohio, set to finish by mid-2027. On top of that, Bitdeer has begun energizing new capacity in Massillon and Oromia, Ethiopia, per the earnings report. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

This groundbreaking development marks a significant milestone in cryptocurrency adoption, bringing Bitcoin payments directly to mainstream retail environments. How Do Bitcoin Payments Work Through Square? Square’s new Bitcoin payments feature leverages the Lightning Network, a second-layer solution built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. This technology enables near-instant transactions while keeping fees remarkably low. When customers choose to pay with Bitcoin, the system generates a Lightning Network invoice that can be scanned and paid within seconds. The merchant receives confirmation almost immediately, making the entire process as seamless as traditional payment methods. This implementation represents a major step forward for cryptocurrency usability. Previously, Bitcoin transactions could take minutes to confirm on the main blockchain. However, with Lightning Network integration, Square has eliminated this barrier, creating a practical solution for everyday purchases. What Benefits Do Real-Time Bitcoin Payments Offer? The advantages of Square’s Bitcoin payments system extend to both merchants and customers. For business owners, accepting Bitcoin payments opens up new revenue streams and attracts tech-savvy customers. Meanwhile, consumers gain more payment flexibility and can use their cryptocurrency holdings for everyday purchases. Instant settlement eliminates waiting for blockchain confirmations Lower transaction fees compared to traditional credit card processing Global accessibility without currency conversion hassles Enhanced security through blockchain technology New customer acquisition from the crypto community Why Is This Important for Cryptocurrency Adoption? Square’s move represents a crucial validation of Bitcoin as a legitimate payment method. As one of the world’s leading payment processors, Square’s endorsement signals to other businesses that Bitcoin payments are ready for mainstream adoption. This development could trigger a domino effect, encouraging more merchants to explore cryptocurrency payment options. The timing couldn’t be better, as cryptocurrency awareness continues to grow globally. By integrating Bitcoin payments into existing point-of-sale systems, Square has removed significant technical barriers that previously prevented widespread merchant adoption. What Challenges Might Merchants Face? While the benefits are substantial, merchants should consider several factors before implementing Bitcoin payments. Price volatility remains a concern, though Square likely implements instant conversion to stable currencies. Technical understanding among staff and customers may require additional training and educational materials. Regulatory compliance varies by jurisdiction, and merchants must ensure they meet local requirements for cryptocurrency transactions. However, Square’s established compliance framework should help streamline this process for participating businesses. How Can Businesses Get Started? Merchants using Square’s point-of-sale systems can enable Bitcoin payments through their dashboard settings. The setup process is designed to be straightforward, requiring minimal technical expertise. Square provides comprehensive documentation and support to help businesses navigate the implementation. Access Bitcoin payments through Square dashboard Configure settlement preferences (instant conversion optional) Train staff on processing Bitcoin transactions Promote Bitcoin payment acceptance to customers Monitor transaction performance and customer response The Future of Bitcoin Payments in Retail Square’s implementation of real-time Bitcoin payments could fundamentally change how we think about digital currency in commerce. As more businesses adopt similar systems, we may see a significant shift toward cryptocurrency integration in everyday transactions. This development positions Bitcoin not just as an investment asset, but as a practical medium of exchange. The success of Square’s Bitcoin payments initiative could inspire other payment processors to follow suit, accelerating cryptocurrency adoption across multiple industries. This represents a pivotal moment where digital currencies transition from niche interest to mainstream financial tool. Frequently Asked Questions How fast are Square’s Bitcoin payments? Transactions process in near real-time, typically completing within seconds thanks to Lightning Network technology. Do merchants receive Bitcoin or traditional currency? Merchants can choose to receive Bitcoin directly or opt for instant conversion to their local currency. Are there extra fees for Bitcoin payments? Square’s Bitcoin payments generally feature lower fees than traditional credit card processing, though specific rates may vary. Can any Square merchant accept Bitcoin? The feature is available to merchants in supported regions using compatible Square point-of-sale systems. Is special hardware needed for Bitcoin payments? No additional hardware is required beyond standard Square payment terminals that can display QR codes. How secure are Bitcoin payments through Square?

Algorand historic price sentiment ALGO price chart by CoinGecko Algorand held its token sale in June 2019 at $2.40 each. Union Square Ventures, Lemniscap, and NGC Ventures, among others, held earlier funding rounds. The public sale raised $60.40 million, while funding rounds raised $66 million. Token sale participants who held their tokens since launch are down 90%. Binance listed ALGO on 21 June 2019. According to CoinMarketCap data, it pumped after the listing to reach its all-time high (ATH) at $3.28. ALGO later crashed; four months later, it was down 90% from its ATH. In July 2021, Coinbase listed ALGO. As a result, it gradually recovered and peaked at $0.64 in August. In retrospect, 2021 was the golden year for the crypto market. The emergence of NFTs, DeFi growth, and institutional interest drove growth. So, in 2021, it rose from a low of $0.32 in January to $2.30 in October, a 200% gain. Nothing prepared crypto enthusiasts for the 2023 crypto winter, which worsened with the FTX crash. The year closed with ALGO trading at $0.23. The decline continued through 2023, registering an all-time low at $0.0876 in September. The market’s recovery began in October. By the end of the year, it had risen above $0.2. It began recovering in November from a low of $0.12, rising as high as $0.61 in December. It then corrected into 2025 below the $0.40 mark in January and $0.35 in February. It crossed into October, trading at $0.22. The coin later nose dived, and by November, it had dropped to $0.16.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ALGO|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-10 17:56:00

54240477,624603,1762797631,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54240477.jpeg,"Donald Trump Is Giving Out $2,000 To Americans, Here’s What Happened To Bitcoin The Last Time Government Gave Out Free Money",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-and-government-free-money/,"US President Donald Trump has announced plans to give out $2,000 to American citizens, drawing attention from analysts who are debating how this influx of cash could impact Bitcoin (BTC) . The last time the US government initiated direct cash payments to citizens, it ignited a massive BTC rally. Now analysts are wondering if history could repeat itself with Trump’s latest stimulus plan. How Bitcoin Surged After Donald Trump’s Stimulus Checks In 2020 The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), signed into law on March 27, 2020, provides a historical blueprint of how payments from the US government can affect the crypto market. According to crypto analyst Satoshi Flipper, once $1,200 checks started reaching Americans in 2020, many recipients immediately funnelled the funds into cryptocurrencies. The analyst noted that just days after the cash distribution announcement, both Coinbase and Binance reported spikes in $1,200 Bitcoin purchases, with users often matching the exact check amounts. At the time, Bitcoin was trading around $6,800, more than 93% below its price of $106,317 at the time of writing. Within six weeks, the leading cryptocurrency had jumped 50% to $10,000, starting the momentum of its historic 2020 price rally . Between 2020 and 2021, Satoshi Flipper disclosed that BTC rose from $3,850 after the March 2020 crash to a previous all-time high above $69,000 . Ethereum also saw dramatic gains, rising from $120 to $4,800. Furthermore, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization grew from around $180 billion to over $3 trillion. He also highlighted that during the cash distributions, millions of new users entered crypto through applications like Robinhood and Cash App. Notably, the combination of government cash, market uncertainty, and retail excitement created a powerful wave of investment that fueled the biggest bull run the market had ever seen. Now, with Trump announcing a new $2,000 stimulus plan for Americans, analysts are speculating about whether history could repeat itself—and if Bitcoin could experience another dramatic bull run . Trump’s $2,000 Cash Plan To Millions Of Americans On November 9, the Trump Truth Social X account, run by the Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), announced that Americans who are not classified as high-income earners could expect $2,000 payments. The post started by criticizing people against tariffs and highlighting the strong economic indicators in the US, including record stock market levels, high 401(k) balances , and low inflation. Trump framed the $2,000 payments as a dividend to ordinary Americans while also emphasizing investments in US businesses, factories, and infrastructure. The administration also claimed that this approach will support citizens directly while managing the nation’s broader economic growth and its $37 trillion debt reduction goals. Speaking on the new cash stimulus, political commentator Brian Krassentein suggests that the plan is intended to help boost the economy, which Trump has described as struggling. Additionally, the total cost of the program could add around $650 billion to the national deficit .",Crypto News|401(k) Balances|and Economic Security Act|binance|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Brian Krassentein|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|CARES Act|Cash App|coinbase|Donald Trump|Ethereum|Relief|Robinhood|Satoshi Flipper|The Coronavirus Aid|TMTG|Trump Media & Technology Group|Trump Truth Social,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-10 18:00:31

According to CryptoQuant, ETH trading volumes on centralized exchanges, particularly Binance, have never been this high, and compared to previous cycles, the difference is obvious. Speculation Dominates the Market On Binance alone, ETH trading volumes have already crossed $6 trillion in 2025, a figure that is roughly two to three times higher than what was observed in prior market cycles. Other major centralized exchanges have followed a similar path, although Binance remains by far the largest venue for ETH derivatives and high-frequency trading. Open interest data further supports the same trend. In August this year, ETH open interest on Binance surpassed $12.5 billion in a new record, which represented a dramatic jump when compared to the previous historic peak. Back in November 2021, when the market was euphoric and Ethereum was approaching its then all-time highs, ETH open interest topped out at only $2.5 billion. The fivefold increase in open interest is in line with the view that speculative positioning has expanded to a scale not previously seen in earlier periods. CryptoQuant added, “Altogether, this shows that the market is highly speculative on ETH this cycle, making its dynamics more fragile than when the spot market represented a larger share of activity. It also explains why the market behaves differently now and seems noticeably less stable.” Key Resistances and Support Against this backdrop, market commentator Ted Pillows observed that Ethereum is approaching a “key” resistance level, and the next major move will likely be determined by price action around $3,700. In his post, Pillows stated that if ETH manages to close a daily candle above this mark, the momentum could trigger a continuation rally toward the $4,000 region. However, if it fails to break above that threshold and is rejected from current levels, a pullback may be imminent. On the flip side, crypto analyst Ali Martinez identified three critical support levels for the altcoin while taking the Pricing Bands as a reference. The first major support sits at $2,866, which currently acts as the closest buffer zone for bulls. The next important level is at $2,528, a deeper support area that could become relevant if selling pressure accelerates or if market volatility spikes. Finally, long-term support sits all the way down at $1,789, a region that has previously served as a strong demand zone.

Steph points to the 2017 run where XRP surged from fractions of a cent to over $2 in a matter of months, even after widespread “it’s over” declarations. His thesis: if you keep holding, the story may not be finished yet. I’ts only over when you sell. $XRP pic.twitter.com/BjKyZLZ7fv — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) November 9, 2025 Echoes of 2017: A Historical Precedent In 2017, XRP began the year at roughly $0.006 USD, and by December it had climbed toward $2–$3, representing gains of over 30,000%. That explosive rise came after periods of doubt and market fatigue. What matters is that the environment of extreme fear preceded the breakout. Steph argues the market today reflects a similar visitor: fear is high, sentiment is low, and many are shouting “it’s over”. Yet history shows that such moments can flip. Sentiment & Technical Signals: Watch the Thresholds Steph highlights two connected signals. First: sentiment. Fear‑and‑greed measures are headed toward rock bottom for XRP‑related assets. When the crowds exit, contrarians note the opportunity. Second: technical structure. Steph specifically warns that the key moment will be when you sell. He’s referenced the 200‑week simple moving average (SMA) for XRP, noting that prior weeks below this line preceded major drops. The implication: the threshold between “it’s over” and “just beginning” may hinge on whether holders capitulate or stay in. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why “It’s Over When You Sell” Matters Steph’s catch‐phrase is deceptively simple: the only time the rally ends for you is when you exit . In plain terms, selling in a panic transforms a potential rebound into a personal defeat. By contrast, staying the course (or at least not panicking out) preserves optionality. The current climate, Steph argues, is more about shadowing the prior cycle than copying it exactly—but the psychology is the same. When everyone says “game over,” someone still holds the ticket. Balanced Context: Risks Remain But this isn’t blind optimism. Even Steph has pointed out clear caveats: XRP must hold critical support levels—especially that 200‑week SMA—to keep the bullish thesis alive. And external risks remain: regulatory headwinds, macro shocks, or unexpected partner setbacks could undo even the best chart. The past doesn’t guarantee the future. In short, unless you sell, the opportunity may still be alive for XRP. Steph contends that the moment many think “it’s over” might instead mark the moment a new chapter begins. For long‑term holders prepared to endure fear, the question isn’t if the story continues, it’s when. Disclaimer: This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

As someone who’s watched hundreds of these launches, I’ve seen most go from hype to silence within weeks. But then I found Noomez , and I was sure I’d found a gem. Now in Phase 3 , the token price has already climbed 23% from Stage 1 , and the presale dashboard shows steady inflows that scream momentum. The project has that rare wow factor : locked liquidity, structured burns, and staking rewards that keep buyers hooked. It feels massive , and the FOMO is real as each phase ticks away. How to Find New Crypto Coins Early Every trader dreams of getting in early before the headlines and the moonshots. But finding new crypto coins to buy takes more than scrolling social media. You look for verified presale trackers, engaged Telegram groups, and whitepapers that show real structure. Most new crypto coins coming out today rely on hype. They trend for a week, maybe two, then vanish when the first red candle hits. That’s why Noomez stands out. It gives you the confidence that your entry is clean and timed right. In crypto, that’s gold. Common Red Flags Behind Failing Crypto Projects After a few years in this space, you start spotting patterns in failing projects. It’s almost always the same formula: Unlocked liquidity that lets developers dump on early buyers. No long-term vision or clear utility beyond memes. Anonymous teams hiding behind cartoon avatars. Inflationary tokens that dilute value after every “update.” When you filter out those traits, only a handful of new crypto coins 2025 actually hold up. Noomez flips this formula entirely: locked liquidity, a 28-stage structure, and transparent tokenomics that reward holding, not dumping. It’s the opposite of the pump-and-dump culture, which is why so many early traders are calling it a must-buy before the next phase closes. Why Noomez ($NNZ) Is the Next 1000x Project Every once in a while, a project comes along that nails both hype and fundamentals. Noomez feels like that moment. Here’s how it stacks up: Feature Noomez ($NNZ) Typical Meme Coin Liquidity Locked & Transparent Unlocked / Risky Token Supply Deflationary (Vault Burns) Inflationary Presale Phases 28 Structured Stages 1–3 Random Rounds Utility Staking + Partner Engine Hype Only Community Real Tribe with Lore & Storyline Short-Term Speculators What really gives Noomez its impressive edge is how it merges storytelling with scarcity. The lore of the Noomies , explorers racing to restore their lunar homeland, ties the presale to a bigger purpose. Fun Fact: Every time a presale phase ends, unsold tokens are burned in the Vault , permanently reducing supply and boosting long-term value. Add the referral code bonus (10% extra NNZ for each new buyer you bring), and it’s easy to see why early holders are stacking up before prices climb again. It’s smart, it’s structured, and it’s pure crazy potential. Verdict – Why $NNZ Is the Smart Trader’s Safe Haven With so many new crypto coins launching daily, traders are drowning in noise. But Noomez is a system built for sustainability , not speculation. Locked liquidity ensures stability. Staking rewards encourage holding. The Noom Gauge gives transparency that most projects only pretend to have. Phase 3 is still open, but the clock is ticking. The next jump in price could easily put you on the outside looking in. Pro Tip: The best time to buy into a solid presale isn’t when everyone’s talking about it, it’s right before the next price bump. That’s now.

The price of spot gold just hit an exciting milestone, reaching $4,110 per ounce – the highest level we’ve seen since October 24. This remarkable surge in spot gold prices has investors and market watchers buzzing with anticipation about what’s next for the yellow metal. What’s Driving the Spot Gold Rally? The recent spike in spot gold values didn’t happen in isolation. Several key factors are contributing to this impressive performance. Market uncertainty, inflation concerns, and geopolitical tensions typically drive investors toward safe-haven assets like gold. Moreover, the current spot gold movement suggests growing confidence in precious metals as a store of value during economic fluctuations. When we examine the spot gold chart patterns, we notice consistent upward momentum building over recent weeks. This isn’t just a temporary blip – the spot gold market appears to be establishing a new support level around these higher price points. Investors who’ve been tracking spot gold performance will recognize this as a significant breakthrough. Why Should You Care About Spot Gold Prices? Understanding spot gold movements matters whether you’re an active investor or simply monitoring economic trends. Here’s why this spot gold surge deserves your attention: Portfolio diversification – Gold often moves independently from stocks and bonds Inflation hedge – Gold typically maintains purchasing power over time Market sentiment indicator – Rising gold prices often signal economic uncertainty Global economic health – Gold demand reflects worldwide economic conditions The current spot gold price of $4,110 represents more than just a number – it’s a barometer of global economic sentiment. When spot gold climbs this dramatically, it often indicates that investors are seeking stability amid market volatility. How Does This Spot Gold Performance Compare Historically? Looking back at spot gold price history, we can see this current level represents a significant recovery from earlier declines. The last time spot gold traded at these heights was in late October, making this a noteworthy comeback story. Historical data shows that when spot gold breaks through key resistance levels, it often establishes new trading ranges. Seasoned gold investors understand that spot gold movements follow patterns influenced by multiple factors. The current spot gold rally appears supported by both technical and fundamental drivers, suggesting this might be more than a temporary spike. However, as with any market movement, careful analysis remains essential. What Can We Expect Next for Spot Gold? While predicting exact price movements remains challenging, several indicators suggest continued strength in spot gold markets. The combination of economic uncertainty and strong physical demand creates a supportive environment for spot gold values. Furthermore, central bank policies and currency fluctuations typically influence spot gold pricing significantly. Market analysts will be watching closely to see if spot gold can maintain these levels and potentially push higher. The $4,110 mark represents an important psychological barrier that, if sustained, could open the door to further gains. However, investors should always approach spot gold investments with appropriate risk management strategies. Final Thoughts on the Spot Gold Surge The recent achievement of $4,110 for spot gold marks an important moment for precious metals investors. This price level, not seen since October, demonstrates gold’s enduring appeal as a safe-haven asset. Whether this represents a new normal for spot gold prices or a temporary peak remains to be seen, but the movement certainly commands attention. As markets continue to evolve, spot gold will likely remain a key indicator of investor sentiment and economic health. The current price action suggests that gold’s traditional role as a store of value remains firmly intact, offering potential opportunities for informed investors. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly is spot gold? Spot gold refers to the current market price for immediate delivery of gold bullion, as opposed to futures contracts for delivery at a later date. Why did gold prices drop in October? Gold prices typically fluctuate based on multiple factors including dollar strength, interest rate expectations, and global economic conditions that affected markets in October. Is now a good time to invest in gold? Investment decisions should be based on individual financial goals and risk tolerance. While current spot gold prices show strength, always consult with a financial advisor before making investment decisions. How can I track spot gold prices? Spot gold prices are widely available through financial news websites, commodity exchanges, and precious metals dealers with real-time updates. What’s the difference between spot gold and gold ETFs? Spot gold represents physical gold prices, while gold ETFs are exchange-traded funds that track gold prices but represent shares in gold-backed assets rather than physical possession. Could gold prices go higher from here? While current momentum is positive, all market investments carry risk. Gold prices depend on numerous economic factors that can change rapidly.

With seven Democrats and Maine Senator Angus King siding with Republicans, the bill has moved to a final vote. The vote could be completed as early as today. If the bill passes, the government would reopen later this week after a 40-day shutdown. The House of Representatives, which recessed months ago, will also be recalled to vote on the Senate's revised text. The agreement includes funding the government through January 30th, reversing the federal layoffs of recent weeks, and holding a special vote on ACA tax credits in December. The Senate's progress quickly revived the crypto market after a week of low morale. Bitcoin jumped over 4 percent to $106,200, Ethereum rose 7.7 percent to $3,629, XRP rose 9.7 percent to $2.47 on Thursday in anticipation of a potential first spot XRP ETF. Bitcoin and Ethereum saw some pullback after the surge. For weeks, ETF outflows, weak retail demand, and fears about tech stock valuations have weighed on cryptocurrencies. The government reopening could inject new energy into the sector, particularly as the SEC resumes operations after a month-long standstill. This means an acceleration of measures like ETF approvals, drafting of formal crypto regulations, and the “innovation exemption” championed by SEC Chairman Paul Atkins. Other agencies like the CFTC and OCC are also expected to reactivate. Related News: After Zcash, Another Altcoin Jumps at the Possibility of Collaboration with ZEC The government reopening also increases the likelihood that the Senate Banking and Agriculture committees will consider crypto-related market structure bills. However, neither committee has released its draft text. With Congress only a week away from the Thanksgiving recess, committee hearings are expected to extend into December. The Senate will also be able to schedule a confirmation hearing for Mike Selig, who has been nominated to chair the CFTC. Selig's inauguration would mark the end of Caroline Pham's term as acting chair. Canary Capital's XRP spot ETF appears poised to begin trading on Nasdaq on Thursday morning. The company bypassed the SEC's scheduling control by removing the “deferral amendment” clause in its S-1 filing, allowing the filing to automatically become effective after the 20-day waiting period required by Section 8(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. The same method was used last month for Bitwise and Grayscale's Solana ETFs. Even if SEC staff are still not fully operational due to a government shutdown, the ETF could launch automatically. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted that the fact that XRP ETF applications haven't undergone the lengthy due diligence period for the Solana ETFs suggests the SEC deems the products ready. This launch will mark a historic turning point for XRP, which has been overshadowed by the years-long Ripple lawsuit. “The launch of spot XRP ETFs represents the final, official closure of the legacy anti-crypto approach,” commented Nate Geraci, President of NovaDius Wealth Management. *This is not investment advice.

The firm, led by Wall Street veteran Tom Lee, announced it had significantly bolstered its Ethereum reserves on November 10, 2025. The acquisition strengthens BitMine as the largest corporate holder of ETH. BitMine buys more ETH On Nov. 10, BitMine announced the purchase of 110,288 ETH, valued at approximately $385 million based on current market prices. The purchase brings the Nasdaq-listed company’s total Ethereum holdings to an impressive 3.5 million tokens. Accordingly, this latest acquisition elevates BitMine’s ETH portfolio to roughly 2.9% of Ethereum’s circulating supply of 120.7 million tokens, a threshold that amplifies the firm’s influence in the ecosystem. The transaction, executed through over-the-counter desks and spot exchanges, reflects a deliberate strategy to capitalize on recent price dips, which have seen ETH trade in the $3,400 to $3,500 range over the past month. Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors and BitMine’s guiding force, emphasized the rationale in a statement: “The recent dip in ETH prices presented an attractive opportunity and BitMine increased its ETH purchases this week,” said Thomas “Tom” Lee of Fundstrat, Chairman of BitMine. “We acquired 110,288 ETH tokens over the past week, 34% more ETH acquired compared to the week prior. This pushed our ETH holdings to 3.5 million, or 2.9% of the supply of ETH. We are now more than halfway towards our initial pursuit of the ‘alchemy of 5%’ of ETH. Additionally, BitMine increased our cash holdings to $398 million from $389 million.” This purchase follows BitMine’s aggressive expansion in 2025, with the firm’s total crypto and cash reserves now standing at $13.2 billion. Its stock has attracted buying from Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest. Ethereum price outlook Ethereum’s price continues to struggle amid short-term bearish pressures. As of November 10, ETH traded near $3,553, down 28% from its August peak of $4,953. Over 24 hours, the price was around 1.2% up, but down 3% over the week. Despite this, more bullish projections abound, including from Tom Lee himself. He envisions a surge by year-end, driven by spot ETH ETF inflows and broader ecosystem growth. “In the aftermath of crypto’s largest ever single day deleveraging event on October 10th, crypto trading volumes are still recovering, which also affect crypto equities. The fourth quarter is seasonally strong for crypto and equity price, and historically encourages investors to increase ‘open interest’ and therefore, associated trading volumes should improve in coming weeks,” Lee said. Tom Lee has said the S&P 500 will hit $7,500, and maintains Bitcoin will reach $200,000 and Ethereum $7,000.

Despite its resurgence, though, one popular analyst believes the asset may not be entirely out of the woods yet. Cause for Concern The past week has been quite turbulent for ETH, whose price crashed below $3,100 on November 5. In the following days, the bulls made some attempts to reclaim the lost ground, and the major uptick occurred on November 9 when US President Donald Trump promised to distribute at least $2,000 to every American outside the high-income bracket. ETH rose to as high as $3,650 before slightly retracing to the current $3,610 (per CoinGecko’s data), representing a nearly 20% increase from the local bottom witnessed earlier this month. ETH Price, Source: CoinGecko Despite the pump, however, some analysts warned that the second-largest cryptocurrency remains in a dangerous zone. X user Posty supports that thesis, arguing that the “structure is still in a multi-month downtrend.” He thinks multiple key levels in and around $4,000 might prevent a more substantial comeback. “Let’s put in a higher low and higher high if we’re truly ready to run this back,” the analyst added. Ted also outlined a rather cautious prediction. In his view, crossing a daily candle above $3,700 could lead to a rally to $4,000, but a rejection may be followed by a drop to the $3,400 support area. The Road to a New ATH? Many others have no concerns and think ETH’s valuation could soon skyrocket to new historic peaks. X user Cas Abbe suggested that the asset’s plunge towards $3,000 last week appears to be “a fakeout,” comparing it to the dip that occurred in Q2 this year, which was followed by a 100% rally. For his part, Ali Martinez envisioned the rise to a fresh all-time high of $10,000. However, he assumed that the price could first collapse to $2,000 before exploding to that level. The low amount of ETH tokens stored on crypto exchanges supports the long-term bullish scenario. Currently, there are fewer than 16 million coins held on such platforms, which is quite close to the nine-year low witnessed earlier this month. The development suggests that investors have been shifting towards self-custody methods, thus reducing the immediate selling pressure and signaling that there are no signs of mass profit-taking.

This strategic partnership represents a significant leap forward in making cryptocurrency accessible for everyday transactions. Why This Stablecoin Payments Expansion Matters The acquisition positions Exodus to become a major player in the Latin American stablecoin payments market. Grateful’s sophisticated software platform enables merchants to seamlessly accept stablecoins through multiple channels. This development comes at a crucial time when many Latin American countries are experiencing currency volatility and seeking reliable digital payment alternatives. Traditional payment systems in the region often face challenges including high fees, slow processing times, and limited accessibility. The integration of Grateful’s technology into Exodus’s ecosystem addresses these pain points directly. Moreover, this expansion of stablecoin payments could provide financial inclusion for millions who currently lack access to traditional banking services. How Will Stablecoin Payments Work for Merchants? Grateful’s platform offers three primary methods for accepting stablecoin payments, each designed for simplicity and security: Wallet-to-wallet payments for direct peer-to-peer transactions QR-based point-of-sale systems for in-store purchases On-chain invoicing for business-to-business transactions These stablecoin payment options provide merchants with immediate settlement and significantly lower transaction costs compared to traditional payment processors. The system operates 24/7, eliminating the delays associated with banking hours and weekend closures that often plague conventional payment systems. What Challenges Might This Stablecoin Payments Initiative Face? While the potential is enormous, expanding stablecoin payments across Latin America presents several hurdles. Regulatory frameworks vary significantly between countries, requiring careful navigation of local financial laws. Additionally, consumer education remains crucial – many potential users still need to understand how stablecoin payments work and why they’re beneficial. Technical infrastructure also varies across the region, with internet connectivity and smartphone penetration differing between urban and rural areas. However, the simplicity of QR-based stablecoin payments makes them accessible even in areas with limited technological resources, potentially bridging this digital divide. Real-World Impact of Enhanced Stablecoin Payments The expansion of stablecoin payments could revolutionize commerce across Latin America. Small businesses can benefit from reduced payment processing fees, while consumers gain access to a stable store of value amid local currency fluctuations. This is particularly valuable in countries experiencing high inflation rates. Cross-border trade within Latin America could also see significant improvements through these stablecoin payment solutions. Traditional international payments often involve multiple intermediaries and lengthy processing times, whereas stablecoin payments can settle almost instantly with minimal fees. Future Outlook for Stablecoin Payments in Latin America The Exodus-Grateful partnership signals a growing recognition that stablecoin payments represent the future of digital commerce in emerging markets. As more merchants adopt these systems, network effects could accelerate adoption exponentially. The success of this initiative could inspire similar stablecoin payment expansions across other developing regions. Looking ahead, we can expect to see continued innovation in stablecoin payment technologies, with potential integrations of loyalty programs, automated accounting features, and enhanced security measures. The foundation being laid today could shape the future of financial transactions across Latin America for years to come. Conclusion: A New Era for Digital Payments The acquisition of Grateful by Exodus marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of stablecoin payments. By combining Exodus’s established wallet infrastructure with Grateful’s merchant-focused technology, this partnership creates a comprehensive solution that addresses real-world payment challenges across Latin America. The expansion of stablecoin payments through this collaboration has the potential to bring financial stability, reduced costs, and increased accessibility to millions of users and businesses throughout the region. Frequently Asked Questions What are stablecoin payments? Stablecoin payments involve using cryptocurrency tokens pegged to stable assets like the US dollar to conduct transactions, combining the stability of traditional currency with the efficiency of blockchain technology. How will Exodus integrate Grateful’s technology? Exodus will incorporate Grateful’s merchant payment tools directly into its wallet ecosystem, allowing users to make stablecoin payments to participating merchants seamlessly. Which countries in Latin America will benefit first? While specific rollout plans haven’t been detailed, countries with existing cryptocurrency adoption like Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico are likely early targets for the stablecoin payments expansion. Are stablecoin payments secure? Yes, stablecoin payments utilize blockchain technology which provides transparent, encrypted transactions that are generally more secure than traditional digital payment methods. What advantages do stablecoin payments offer merchants? Merchants benefit from lower transaction fees, faster settlement times, reduced chargeback risk, and access to customers who prefer using digital assets. How can consumers start using these stablecoin payment services? Consumers can download the Exodus wallet, acquire stablecoins, and then use them at merchants who have implemented Grateful’s payment acceptance technology.

The company will enable over 4 million merchants with its Square payment system to accept Bitcoin as payment. Dorsey announced the update on X. He stated , “O ur sellers can now receive BTC to BTC, BTC to fiat, fiat to BTC, or fiat to fiat we have one in CashApp, all merchants (not just Square) worldwide that accept bitcoin.” Now, traders worldwide can choose their preferred settlement method without added complexity. Traders go live with Bitcoin payments Dorsey first confirmed that his company was actively working on integrating Bitcoin payments for merchants on April 3rd. He wrote, “not a simple flip, but we are doing it.” The company provided more details on the project last month, promising that it would go live today. It’s here. Starting today, over 4 million Square sellers can accept Bitcoin at checkout. Zero fees until 2027. Instant settlement. Global freedom. The switch is flipped – and this is only the start. @Square | @block | #Bitcoin ⚡️ pic.twitter.com/q03dpLxdz7 — Jacob Szymik (@JacobSzymik) November 10, 2025 The launch provides access to instant settlement with no fees until 2027. Thereafter, the company shall levy a nominal fee of 1%. This is significantly lower than the typical credit card rates, which can range from 2.5% to 3.5%. The feature is accessible to traders from the Square dashboard to activate. Buys are executed on the Bitcoin blockchain, making transactions transparent and traceable. BTC and Fiat money are both supported on the platform. Block is also using the Lightning Network. It is a scaling solution of Bitcoin, which transacts almost instantly with low charges. This allows traders not only to get Bitcoin directly, but they can also use auto-conversion to US dollars as a more stable option. However, Bitcoin payments cannot be reversed, and compared to credit cards, there is no chargeback option. Although the feature is limiting, it lowers the possibility of fraud. The project will enable millions of businesses, online shopping platforms, and major retail outlets to receive Bitcoin payments safely and securely. Block has previously invested in Bitcoin’s infrastructure. The company owns more than 8,000 BTC worth around half a billion dollars. According to reports, it continues to build out its crypto ecosystem with products like the Bitkey hardware wallet. To that end, Block has recorded significant growth in the financial technology and crypto sectors. Meanwhile, the company reported earnings of $0.54 per share in the third quarter. Revenue was $6.11 billion, slightly below the estimated $6.312 billion. However, despite the earnings gap, Square’s gross payment volume still rose 12% from a year earlier. According to market watchers, this integration will provide users and businesses with financial freedom through open systems. The Bitcoin market bounces back as institutional demand rises Jack Dorsey’s Block generated $1.97 billion in Bitcoin revenue for Q3. This is nearly one-third of its total revenues. However, Block’s Bitcoin costs dropped to $1.89 billion in Q3, though its 8,780 BTC balance sheet holdings booked a $59 million quarterly loss. Additionally, Kazakhstan plans to establish a $1 billion cryptocurrency reserve fund by 2026. It plans to use seized and repatriated assets plus proceeds from state mining. Meanwhile, the price of BTC is up by approximately 1.68% in the last 24 hours. Its trade volume is still up a big 39%, at $74 billion. The rise in trading volume may have been pushed by Strategy’s purchase, which added more Bitcoin to its portfolio. As reported by Cryptopolitan, Strategy purchased an additional 487 Bitcoin, worth approximately $50 million. This is the largest purchase the company has made since late September 2025, and it now holds a total of 641,692 BTC in its portfolio. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

This development comes as the nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation faces declining human traffic while AI bots increasingly drain server resources without contributing to the platform’s sustainability. Why Wikipedia’s AI Strategy Matters Now The Wikimedia Foundation recently revealed that AI bots caused unusually high traffic spikes in May and June 2025, with bots actively trying to evade detection systems. Meanwhile, human page views dropped 8% year-over-year, creating a perfect storm that threatens the encyclopedia’s long-term viability. This situation highlights the urgent need for a sustainable approach to Wikipedia AI content access. The Wikimedia Enterprise Solution for AI Companies Wikimedia Enterprise represents the foundation’s answer to the AI content access dilemma. This paid platform offers companies reliable, scalable access to Wikipedia’s vast knowledge base without overwhelming the nonprofit’s servers. The service ensures that: AI companies get clean, structured data through official channels Wikipedia’s servers aren’t taxed by excessive scraping The nonprofit receives financial support for its mission Content attribution remains clear and consistent The Real Cost of AI Scraping on Wikipedia Unauthorized AI scraping doesn’t just strain technical resources—it threatens Wikipedia’s very ecosystem. When AI companies extract content without proper attribution or support, they undermine the human contributors who create and maintain the knowledge. The foundation warns that with fewer visits to Wikipedia, fewer volunteers may grow and enrich content, and fewer individual donors may support this crucial work. Impact Area Before AI Scraping After AI Scraping Surge Human Traffic Stable growth 8% decrease year-over-year Server Load Predictable patterns Spikes from evasive AI bots Volunteer Engagement Consistent participation Potential decline risk How Generative AI Companies Can Respond Responsibly The Wikimedia Foundation isn’t just making demands—it’s providing clear guidelines for ethical generative AI development. Companies should: Use the official Wikimedia Enterprise API for large-scale access Provide clear attribution to human contributors Support Wikipedia’s nonprofit mission financially Ensure transparency about content sources The Critical Role of Proper API Access For AI companies seeking reliable knowledge integration, proper API access through Wikimedia Enterprise offers significant advantages over scraping. The paid service provides structured data feeds, technical support, and the assurance that access won’t be suddenly blocked due to bot detection systems. This reliability is crucial for companies building AI systems that depend on current, accurate information. What This Means for AI Development Wikipedia’s stance represents a watershed moment for the AI industry. As more content providers reconsider their relationships with AI companies, the era of free, unrestricted scraping may be ending. Companies that adapt early to paid, ethical content access models will likely face fewer disruptions and build more sustainable AI systems. FAQs: Wikipedia’s New AI Guidelines What is Wikimedia Enterprise? Wikimedia Enterprise is the Wikimedia Foundation’s paid API service that provides companies with reliable, scalable access to Wikipedia content while supporting the nonprofit’s mission. Which AI companies are affected by this change? All companies using generative AI that train on or access Wikipedia content, including major players in the AI industry, should consider transitioning to the official API. How does this impact Wikipedia’s nonprofit status? The Wikimedia Foundation remains a nonprofit, but Wikimedia Enterprise provides a sustainable revenue stream to support its operations amid declining human traffic. What happens if companies continue scraping? While Wikipedia hasn’t threatened legal action, continued scraping may lead to more sophisticated bot detection and potential access restrictions. Wikipedia’s call for responsible AI content access marks a crucial turning point in how technology companies interact with open knowledge resources. By choosing paid API access over uncontrolled scraping, AI developers can help ensure that the world’s largest encyclopedia continues to thrive in the artificial intelligence era.

Here’s How $10,000 Could Turn Into $800,000",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/investing-in-rentstac-rns-today-heres-how-10000-could-turn-into-800000/,"As the DeFi sector heads into what analysts expect to be another strong market cycle in early 2026, investor sentiment is shifting away from speculative tokens and meme-driven hype. The spotlight is now on sustainable, utility-based projects with tangible economic value. That’s exactly where RentStac (RNS) comes in. Built around tokenized real estate income, it combines the stability of traditional property markets with the innovation of blockchain finance. Priced at just $0.025 , the project is drawing attention for its simple but powerful potential: an early $10,000 investment could be worth $800,000 once the token lists and scales toward its projected market value. The DeFi market is entering a new phase defined by real yield and asset-backed utility. While early DeFi platforms focused on liquidity farming, the next generation is rooted in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. According to the World Economic Forum, over $10 trillion in traditional assets could be tokenized by 2030. Real estate is at the forefront of that transformation, offering predictable returns and broad investor appeal. RentStac (RNS) is positioning itself to capture that market by bridging property income with blockchain accessibility. The RentStac (RNS) presale is accelerating fast. Having already exceeded $650,000 raised , the project continues to attract global interest as investors recognize the early opportunity in RWA-based DeFi. The total token supply is 2 billion RentStac (RNS) , with 40% (800 million tokens) allocated for the presale. Each presale phase increases the token price, rewarding early adopters. The current price is $0.025 , and investors receive a 100% token bonus , effectively doubling their holdings. At this rate, a $10,000 allocation equals 400,000 RentStac (RNS) , or 800,000 tokens with the bonus. When the token reaches $1, that position would be valued at $800,000 . With over 650K raised and growing daily, RentStac (RNS) is shaping up as one of the strongest DeFi launches of Q4 2025. Unlike typical DeFi projects that rely on token inflation to provide returns, RentStac (RNS) generates income through real rental properties held in legally registered special purpose vehicles (SPVs). Each RentStac (RNS) token represents a fractional stake in verified income-producing properties. Investors receive monthly USDC payouts directly linked to rental revenue, creating stable, measurable, and transparent yield. The platform also allows token staking and DAO governance, letting users vote on new property acquisitions and platform parameters. A secondary marketplace is in development, which will bring liquidity to tokenized real estate and open up global access to property-backed investments. RentStac (RNS) has achieved a 92.48% SolidityScan audit score , with a full CertiK audit underway. Multi-signature wallets, oracle verification of property income, and KYC/AML compliance for all SPVs ensure both security and legitimacy. This structure enables RentStac (RNS) to bridge the gap between blockchain innovation and institutional-grade regulation. Investors gain the transparency of DeFi with the reliability of traditional property frameworks. The tokenomics of RentStac (RNS) are designed for long-term value appreciation. Total supply: 2 billion RentStac (RNS) . Presale allocation: 40% . Buyback and burn mechanisms funded by rental income reduce circulating supply, while staking rewards provide passive income from verified property revenue. This deflationary design ensures that as platform adoption grows, token scarcity increases, reinforcing upward price momentum. With the presale already past the $650K milestone and community engagement rising sharply, RentStac (RNS) is rapidly emerging as a key player in the real-world asset revolution. In a market increasingly defined by tangible value and transparency, RentStac (RNS) is standing out as one of the few DeFi projects bridging Web3 with real economic activity. Its mix of audited security, verifiable asset income, and early-stage growth potential is why analysts are calling RentStac (RNS) one of the top cryptos to watch in Q4 2025. The presale is live now.

54241868,624770,1762801218,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54241868.jpeg,Stablecoins Are Booming — And The Fed Thinks They Could Cut Rates,https://bitcoinist.com/stablecoins-are-booming-and-the-fed-thinks-they-could-cut-rates/,"Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran said growing demand for dollar-pegged stablecoins could push down interest rates , putting a new factor on the Fed’s radar. According to a speech he gave at the BCVC Summit on November 7, stablecoins that channel savings into dollar assets may raise the supply of loanable funds and lower the Neutral interest rate, or “R” star. Stablecoin Growth And Scale Based on reports compiled by Fed staff, private-sector estimates place stablecoin adoption between $1 trillion and $3 trillion by the end of the decade — a jump large enough to matter for markets and policy. Miran compared the possible scale of stablecoin demand to the Fed’s own purchases during the COVID-era stimulus and noted that under $7 trillion in Treasury bills are outstanding today, making any major new buyer meaningful. How It Could Lower Rates Researchers have started to put numbers on the effect. Work cited in Miran’s remarks estimates stablecoins, if widely used and backed by US securities, might nudge interest rates down by as much as 40 basis points. That kind of shift in R rating would change what counts as a neutral policy stance and could prompt the Fed to set lower policy rates than otherwise. Big Buyers And Reserve Holdings Reports and working papers point to one tangible channel: where stablecoin issuers park their reserves. Evidence shows some large issuers have been big buyers of short-term Treasury bills. For example, one study found Tether held an estimated $98 billion in T-bills by Q1 2025, roughly 1.6% of outstanding T-bills, and that such buying has been linked to lower short-term yields. That suggests stablecoin flows can have real effects on front-end rates. Risks And Policy Choices Miran told listeners that regulatory clarity will shape the path forward. He praised proposals like the GENIUS Act for forcing issuers to hold safe, liquid dollar assets, but warned that how stablecoins are financed matters: if issuance simply repackages existing dollar holdings, the effect on loanable funds will be small. Policymakers must weigh the boost to dollar demand against possible strains on banks, money markets, and the Treasury market. Reports have disclosed that the scale and speed of adoption remain uncertain. If the higher forecasts play out, central bankers will need to consider stablecoin demand as part of the mix when setting rates.

Related Reading: MEXC Users At Risk Of Losing Their Crypto? Ex-Public Advisor Exposes ‘Structural Rot’ While spot ETF outflows are causing concern in some quarters, underlying network fundamentals and technical charts are painting a cautiously optimistic picture, with analysts pointing to a potential move toward the $4,400 mark. Ethereum ETF Outflows and Institutional Sentiment Despite ETH’s recent price recovery, institutional sentiment appears to be on firmer ground even as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tied to Ethereum record sizeable outflows. Data show that Ethereum spot ETFs suffered a net outflow of approximately $508 million over the week, marking one of the largest weekly withdrawals in their history. This mirrors a broader shift in investor behaviour: while traditional crypto-fund inflows have tapered, margins of institutional conviction remain steady. On the one hand, redemptions suggest a short-term cooling of enthusiasm for ETH amongst ETF investors. On the other hand, this rotation may reflect a more strategic recalibration rather than a wholesale withdrawal of institutional capital. ETH's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview Strong ETH Price Support and Technical Setup From a price-action standpoint, Ethereum shows signs of stabilisation. After a sharp weekly drop of around 12 %, the asset has rebounded above the $3,400 level. Analysts have identified key resistance near $3,720, with breakout targets in sight at approximately $4,400 and a further extension toward $4,955. Key technical highlights include: Holding the $3,200–$3,350 liquidity zone as support before the rebound. The break of a bearish trend line near $3,350, alongside clearing the 50 % Fibonacci retracement of the recent decline. Momentum indicators, such as MACD and RSI, are entering bullish territory, suggesting that the upside could be favored if resistance levels are conquered. Network Fundamentals and Catalysts Beyond price movements, Ethereum’s on-chain fundamentals offer reason for optimism. While some metrics are cooling, the total value locked (TVL) in the network has fallen by roughly 24% in the past 30 days to around $74.2 billion. On the flip side, Ethereum’s revenue from applications hit record levels as recently as mid-October, driven by stable-coin activity and increasing usage of the network’s “economic machine.” A key upcoming catalyst is the planned “Fusaka” upgrade, scheduled for early December, which is expected to enhance scalability and security in the Ethereum network, potentially boosting long-term value drivers.

Signals of fresh liquidity and policy‑driven stimulus are echoing through digital asset circles. Analysts are now pointing to macro moves that could reignite momentum for risk assets—including XRP. In a recent video clip circulating on X, commentator Levi Rietveld urged XRP holders to heed a specific policy announcement by President Donald J. Trump : “Trump just made a historic announcement, he is looking to bring back the stimulus checks. This is going to be so huge for XRP.” Rietveld’s commentary ties Trump’s proposed $2,000 “tariff dividend” to a new bull‑run narrative for crypto. The Stimulus Plan and Its Market Implications President Trump announced that most Americans would receive a “dividend of at least $2,000 a person (not including high‑income people)” funded by tariff revenue. The plan remains a proposal, requiring congressional approval and subject to legal review by the tariff authority. Analysts in crypto media immediately flagged this as a possible liquidity injection that could drive asset markets. F*CK!! ITS HAPPENING #XRP !! Comment “knowledge” and I’ll DM you access to my community! #crypto #ripple pic.twitter.com/4yANzRLVS9 — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) November 9, 2025 Why XRP Could Be a Beneficiary Rietveld’s bullish angle on XRP is rooted in the expectation that newly liberated consumer cash will find its way into risk assets. With crypto infrastructure stronger and investor appetite higher than during the 2020‑21 stimulus era, XRP may be well‑positioned when fresh capital hits. Rietveld specifically linked the stimulus narrative to XRP’s utility and cross‑border payment prospects , arguing the conditions are favorable for out‑sized upside. Market Environment and Liquidity Context The last major wave of stimulus during the COVID‑19 era coincided with the crypto bull run of 2020–21. Presently, policy signals include both direct payments and potential rate cuts, increasing the appeal of risk assets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The proposed tariff dividend gains traction as many households may receive relief, which could generate new flows into crypto holdings like XRP. Risks and Realistic Perspectives While the narrative is compelling, significant caveats remain. First, the plan remains unlegislated, and its funding mechanism (tariffs) is under legal scrutiny. Second, implementing the payments as tax credits rather than direct checks may blunt the expected injection of liquidity. In addition, any global liquidity surge could also raise inflation pressures and provoke a tighter monetary response—potentially countering the bullish effect. Strategic Takeaways for XRP Holders For holders of XRP , the message is clear: monitor the policy process closely and be prepared, but remain grounded. If the tariff‑dividend is approved and executed, it may catalyze a renewed leg up in crypto valuations. But investors must also weigh the legal, timing, and inflation risks that could temper outcomes. In closing, the combination of direct payments, enhanced crypto infrastructure, and a supportive policy backdrop presents one of the most intriguing setups in recent memory. For XRP holders, the question isn’t simply whether the narrative will play out—but how well‑positioned you are before the wave hits.

The new agreement would allow slightly lower swipe fees, give retailers more freedom to accept specific cards, and marginally reduce swipe fees. The deal reached on Monday would put an end to twenty years of litigation. Merchants accused Visa and Mastercard of conspiring to violate U.S. antitrust laws, notably through the card networks’ collection of “swipe fees” to process transactions. Visa, Mastercard settlement offers merchants more flexibility According to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) report , the agreement grants retailers the freedom to decide whether to accept commercial and consumer credit cards independently. Merchants would have more freedom to take “standard” and “premium” credit cards under consumer credit. However, merchants wouldn’t be able to distinguish between cards of the same level issued by various financial institutions. Mastercard and Visa agreed to provide a 10-point basis average system-wide effective interchange rate for U.S.-issued consumer credit and commercial credit transactions at U.S. merchant locations. Additionally, the interchange reduction will apply to specific U.S.-issued credit programs recognized under the Mastercard brand and is intended to function as a cap for a duration of five years. As part of the agreement, the networks agreed to implement a direct method of surcharging credit card transactions, giving merchants additional options. According to the SEC, these regulations, which replace standards that were revised in 2012, are intended to preserve fundamental consumer safeguards and openness. Standard consumer rates would be limited to 1.25% until the end of the agreement. Additionally, merchants would have additional possibilities to charge surcharges for credit card purchases. According to the U.S. National Retail Federation, swipe fees amounted $111.2 billion in the U.S. in 2024, up from $100.8 billion in 2023 and quadrupling the amount in 2009. Visa confirmed that the settlement offers meaningful relief, more flexibility, and options to control how it accepts payments from its customers to businesses of all sizes. According to Mastercard, companies and customers would have a better payment experience with greater flexibility, cheaper prices, and easier regulations, especially for smaller retailers. Notably, neither of the companies acknowledged any wrongdoing in relation to the plaintiffs’ claims when they agreed to the deal. After the agreement is approved, all rule and practice modifications will take place, which is anticipated to happen most likely in late 2026 or early 2027. Judge rejects $30B card fee settlement The settlement will require approval by U.S. District Judge Margo Brodie in Brooklyn, who had previously rejected the $30 billion agreement in June 2024. The $30 billion accord would have reduced swipe costs by around 0.07 percentage points over five years, giving retailers additional leeway to apply surcharges. However, the judge stated that fees would continue to be high and that the $6 billion in yearly savings for retailers was “paltry” in comparison to what Visa and Mastercard might still charge. Brodie also criticized the agreement for imposing the “Honor All Cards” requirement on merchants, which mandates that they take all Visa and Mastercard cards or none at all. Additionally, merchants have long accused Visa and Mastercard of implementing “anti-steering” regulations that prohibit companies from guiding clients toward less expensive payment methods. According to the Merchants Payments Coalition, the charge reduction was “minuscule,” and Visa and Mastercard would be allowed to increase prices without any limitations once temporary cuts expired. The Merchants Payment Coalition claimed that merchants had “no choice” but to accept rewards cards, which make up 85% of all cards issued. The Coalition added that banks could still shift cards into different categories, effectively requiring merchants to accept all cards. The reported settlement proposal comes as Congress is considering the Credit Card Competition Act in an attempt to bring competition into the system.

The platform, revealed this week, allows individuals to buy new crypto tokens before they’re listed on the Coinbase exchange. According to Coinbase , this is the company’s latest attempt to grab more control of the crypto fundraising pipeline and pull retail buyers back into the game for the first time since 2018. Sales on the new platform will happen monthly, with one token launch per cycle. Users get a one-week window to send in purchase requests. An algorithm then decides how to spread out the tokens. This isn’t some lottery or insider deal. The company said the goal is to keep it fair and prevent the same people from snapping up everything every time. Buyers must be fully registered with Coinbase, follow all compliance rules, and fund their purchases in USD Coin, a stablecoin tied to the U.S. dollar and issued by Circle Internet Group. Investors must follow rules while issuers face vetting process Only users who are in good standing with Coinbase will be allowed to take part. If you’re not verified, you don’t get in. And if you plan to flip your tokens immediately for a quick gain, don’t expect to get as much allocation in the future. That’s straight from Scott Shapiro, head of trading at Coinbase, who explained that users who dump tokens right after a sale will get a lower allocation in the next round. The same goes for project founders. They and their affiliates won’t be able to sell any tokens, privately or publicly, for six months after launch. That applies across the board. The process for launching tokens on the platform is just as strict. The company said crypto projects will be screened based on how much interest they have from users, the track record of their teams, how the tokens will work economically, and how they’ll be released over time. No more “just white paper” launches like in 2017. The first token to go live on the platform will come from Monad, a crypto startup that plans to launch its token next week. Once a token goes through this new system, Coinbase said it intends to list it on the exchange, giving it exposure to a broader user base. The platform will be open to most global users at launch, and Coinbase said it plans to roll it out to more regions later. Platform revives public crypto sales for U.S. retail investors This is the first time since the ICO crash of 2018 that retail users in the U.S. are being invited back into public token offerings. Back then, billions of dollars were thrown at crypto startups that had nothing but ideas. No products. No accountability. That whole scene collapsed when prices tanked and regulators came for everyone. Coinbase is trying to bring that same excitement back, but with guardrails. Scott said that things are different now. “In 2017, the market was so young that no one really had a deep crypto resume before launching a token,” he said. “Now, projects and their teams have more to show than just a white paper.” The platform is part of a bigger plan for Coinbase. The company has been looking to move away from relying too much on crypto trading fees, which have dropped across the industry. By charging projects to launch their tokens and growing the number of coins available to trade, Coinbase is aiming to bring in new revenue streams while luring users who’ve been going to offshore platforms. The launch also adds to the company’s push to become an “everything exchange”—not just a place to trade Bitcoin or Ethereum, but a one-stop platform for financial services built around crypto.

The American exchange announced it will launch the initiative later this month, aiming to restore public participation in early-stage crypto projects under strict compliance controls. The first token to debut on the new platform will be from Monad, a blockchain protocol whose sale will run from November 17 to 22, as Bitzo reported. Coinbase plans to host roughly one token sale per month going forward, creating a structured, recurring schedule for new digital asset launches. A Fairer Model for Token Distribution Each token sale will be open for one week, during which verified users can submit purchase requests. Once the sale period ends, Coinbase’s allocation system will prioritize smaller buyers first, gradually expanding to fill larger orders. This approach, the company said, is meant to ensure broader participation and prevent large investors from dominating the process. Coinbase has also added a mechanism to discourage rapid speculative selling. Users who immediately offload their tokens after launch will see their allocation potential reduced in future offerings. The exchange described the system as a way to promote fairer distribution and reduce “dumping” behavior that has historically plagued public token sales. Compliance and Settlement in USDC Only verified Coinbase users will be eligible to participate, and all purchases will be settled in USDC, the dollar-backed stablecoin issued by Circle. Token issuers listing through the platform will face a six-month lockup period, preventing project founders and affiliates from selling or transferring tokens on secondary markets without Coinbase’s prior approval and public disclosure. This restriction aims to maintain price stability and protect investors from insider selling shortly after launch. Participation will be free for retail buyers, but token issuers will pay a fee based on the total amount of USDC raised, along with any associated listing costs. Renewed Access for U.S. Retail Investors The move represents a major milestone for the U.S. crypto sector, where retail access to regulated public token offerings has been virtually nonexistent since 2018. Coinbase’s regulated approach seeks to fill a long-standing gap between private fundraising rounds—typically reserved for venture capitalists—and the broader investing public. By implementing compliance safeguards and transparent rules, the platform could set a precedent for how token sales are conducted in the United States going forward. Remembering the ICO Boom and Its Collapse Coinbase’s new offering arrives years after the spectacular rise and fall of the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) era. ICOs emerged in 2017 as a novel method for blockchain startups to raise capital directly from the public by selling newly minted tokens. By the first half of 2018, ICOs had raised an estimated $13.7 billion , more than double the total collected in 2017. However, the boom quickly attracted regulatory attention. In 2017, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) signaled that some tokens could qualify as securities under the Howey test , bringing them under existing investment laws. A 2018 report by Ernst & Young examined over 140 major ICOs and revealed that 86% of tokens were trading below their launch prices within a year, while nearly a third had lost almost all their value. The combination of regulatory crackdowns, investor losses, and a deep crypto bear market effectively ended the ICO frenzy. Coinbase’s Attempt to Modernize the ICO Model By introducing transparency, compliance oversight, and anti-dumping mechanisms, Coinbase appears to be reviving the ICO model with institutional-grade safeguards. If successful, the platform could usher in a new era of compliant token fundraising, bridging the gap between the innovation of crypto’s early days and the regulatory expectations of today’s markets. Earlier this month, Coinbase clashed with several US banks over a key stablecoin interest rule as part of the recently passed GENIUS Act.",Crypto News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TOKEN SALE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-11-10 19:25:47

With the emergence of the leading cryptocurrencies, there is a new crypto with DeFi that is attracting attention due to its systematic growth and community. This token has scores of early adopters who think that this $0.035 coin could be among the best crypto investments by 2026 as it suits towards its first big release. A DeFi Ecosystem Constructed to be Open and Efficient Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized protocol, developed to enhance the functionality of on-chain markets. It is a hybrid of automation, transparency and control by users using smart contracts that govern all transactions. It is aimed at ensuring that decentralized finance is smoother and safer to both lenders and borrowers. The model of Mutuum Finance comes with a provision of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending markets where users may deposit assets into common liquidity markets and receive back a yield. Once a user deposits tokens, such as ETH or USDT, they are issued with mtTokens, or a digital receipt, which earns interest automatically whenever a borrower uses the liquidity. In addition to the pooled model, Mutuum Finance will also roll out a Peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplace whereby users can come up with custom loan arrangements. The borrowers will be able to choose the rates and terms that reflect their risk preference, and the system-permitted parameters such as Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios and liquidation limits facilitate the selection of the terms and rates. The liquidation system of the platform helps in closing the over stretched positions automatically to save the lenders. Growth, Demand and Metrics The presale of Mutuum Finance has been widely discussed as one of the DeFi events of 2025. The project has accumulated over $18.55 million in the first place and has drawn over 17,850 holders. The total number of MUTM token supply is 4 billion, with 45.5% (approximately 1.82 billion) of it being allocated to presale. As the presale started in early 2025, the token price started at $0.01 in Phase 1 and is now standing at $0.035 in Phase 6, which is a 250% rise. The launch price is pegged at $0.06 which is another progress in an upward direction as the project moves towards possible top-tier exchange listings. All of our phases are fixed-allocation-model, that is, when all the tokens in that phase have been sold, the next one commences at a higher price. Phase 6 is already more than 85% sold and the pressure is mounting with supply becoming tight. The increased involvement indicates the high demand of this new crypto. To enhance the engagement the team also came up with a 24-hour leaderboard where the highest contributor of the day is offered with $500 worth of MUTM. This distinctive approach fosters transparency and community engagement making the presale an interactive process, as opposed to a funding round. V1 Testnet Launch and Security Milestones Mutuum Finance is in the process of preparing its V1 protocol to roll it out on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025, and then continue on to a full rollout onto the mainnet in 2026. The V1 will have liquidity pools to lenders and borrowers, mtTokens to deposits and debt tokens to borrowers and a liquidator bot to keep the system in balance. Since inception, the team has been very keen on security. Mutuum Finance has passed a CertiK audit with an impressive token score, which is an indication that it can be trusted with regards to its smart contract structure. Also, the team operates a bug bounty program of $50,000 to encourage any code vulnerabilities that may be ethically reported prior to the mainnet release. According to the market observers, such measures would boost investor trust, since transparency and security continue to be the main mantra in the growth plan of the project. Long-term Catalysts The other fundamental element of the roadmap of Mutuum Finance is the creation of USD-pegged stablecoin, which is embedded within the lending protocol. This aspect will enable the users to be able to borrow or lend within a stable environment whilst yielding through the interest outflow channeled to the project treasury. Mutuum Finance is also looking forward to spreading to the Layer-2 networks to enhance the scalability and reduce the transaction costs. This multi-chain vision means that the project will be able to serve all users in varying ecosystems, which would improve the depth of liquidity and protocol penetration. These upgrades might have a significant impact on the long-term value chart of MUTM as stable yield mechanisms and cross-chain support are some of the key drivers of increased adoption, according to some analysts. Toward the Next Milestone Mutuum Finance has a solid roadmap, an engaged community, and an evident technical direction, which makes the project the cream of the crop to follow before 2026. On-chain lending mechanics combined with community incentives and advanced tokenomics have resulted in a perpetual development of momentum. With the approaching Phase 6 close and the Sepolia testnet soon coming to the scene, Mutuum Finance gains more and more credibility in an industry that is gradually rewarding actual utility.

This comes at a time when demand for these minerals is exploding across industries that make electric vehicles, wind turbines, advanced electronics, and defense systems. According to CNBC, President Vladimir Putin last week ordered officials in Moscow to finish a full road map by December 1 for the long-term extraction and processing of rare and rare-earth metals. That order was issued inside the Kremlin, as the government tries to regain ground in a field where others moved earlier and faster. The United States Geological Survey estimates there are around 110 million tonnes of rare-earth deposits worldwide. China controls around 44 million tonnes, followed by Brazil with 21 million tonnes, while India and Australia hold significant shares as well. Myanmar holds large, heavy rare-earth deposits, but the size is not officially known. Russia is believed to have the fifth-largest reserves, totaling roughly 3.8 million tonnes. That is larger than the United States, which is estimated to have around 1.9 million tonnes. Yet despite this advantage, Russia produced only about 2,500 metric tons this year, or roughly 0.64% of global output. Moscow orders expansion plan as demand rises Putin’s government is now preparing to expand production. The effort comes as global supply chains tighten, especially after China limited exports of rare-earth materials in reaction to U.S. tariffs . Those limits were paused after an agreement between Donald Trump, now back in the White House, and Xi Jinping, where China agreed to suspend controls for one year in exchange for reduced fentanyl-related tariffs. Trump has also explored securing rare-earth resources in Ukraine, where deposits lie mostly in the south and east of the country, areas partially occupied by Russian forces. He has also repeatedly shown interest in resource-rich Greenland. Aware of that, Putin stated publicly that the country is open to joint projects with foreign partners to extract and process its rare-earth metals. Willis Thomas, principal consultant at CRU Group, said Russia has mined rare metals for decades but is now trying to reposition itself. Thomas said, “The U.S. is scrambling for a need. Russians are scrambling for an opportunity.” That opportunity, however, depends on the quality of deposits and the transparency of geological reporting. Earlier this year, the Natural Resources Ministry in Moscow claimed the country has reserves of 15 rare-earth metals totaling 28.5 million tonnes, which is far higher than U.S. Geological Survey figures. Thomas said some reserves may be of lower quality, while others may be undisclosed entirely. He said the only reason a government would reveal full geological breakdowns is to raise outside capital. Decision between China and the U.S. remains unresolved A major question now is whether Russia strengthens ties with China or seeks development deals with Western partners. Thomas explained that mining is the simple part. Processing, separation, and finding buyers is where China dominates, handling roughly 69% of global rare-earth refining. Russia has already expanded supply chains with Beijing and could become one of several raw-ore suppliers, alongside Myanmar, Malaysia, and Laos. China has been increasing imports of raw materials to maintain output as some of its domestic deposits decline in grade. The option to partner with the U.S. is complicated by the war in Ukraine and strained relations between Trump and Putin. Trump recently met leaders from five Central Asian nations to discuss critical minerals and said expanding American supply chains is a key priority. Piyush Goel, a critical metals analyst at CRU, said Western companies may refuse to buy material from Russia while the war continues. That would push the country closer to China instead, even if that means selling with no pricing advantage. Goel said China’s processing and separation network is so advanced that Russia could position itself to fill future supply gaps when Chinese deposits decline.

The Senate cleared a procedural hurdle on a funding package that would restore agency operations and provide back pay if enacted. Reuters reported the advance on November 10, 2025. Bitcoin reclaimed levels north of $105,000 on relief buying while sentiment gauges stayed cautious, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index lodged in the “fear” zone. The split between price and mood captures a market reacting to policy progress yet still managing damage from recent drawdowns. Bitcoin Price (Source: CoinMarketCap) Policy Relief Meets Heavy Outflows Listed product flows set a cooler backdrop. Farside Investors’ tracker shows roughly $1.2 billion in net outflows from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs over the latest week, a sum that has frequently absorbed rebounds and limited follow-through during New York hours. Reuters noted that a shutdown resolution lowers near-term policy noise, which typically steadies risk positioning. That effect can help liquidity providers rebuild depth; however, persistent ETF redemptions can offset those gains by recycling supply into the market during rallies. Glassnode’s previous “Week On-Chain” review described long-term holders as net distributors in strength since late October. When seasoned wallets sell into bounces at the same time ETFs see outflows, cash demand needs to expand to absorb both channels before any base becomes durable. A clean finish to the funding bill would remove a near-term overhang. If that outcome pairs with slowing ETF redemptions, relief can extend beyond a single session and broaden to more trading windows. WLFI and Official Trump climb after Senate passes funding bill, easing shutdown fears and lifting sentiment across altcoin markets. #shutdown #trump #altcoin https://t.co/quXGxOj3fp — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 10, 2025 Flows, Depth, And The Price Path Basis and funding normalized during the pullback, which often marks a reset rather than a trend change. The next phase depends on cash inflows. A turn from net outflows to net inflows in the U.S. spot ETFs would indicate that fresh demand is exceeding distribution. Order-book quality provides a second check: rebuilt depth on BTC pairs across top venues during London and New York sessions tends to reduce gap risk and helps rallies survive headline swings. Market participants track cumulative depth bands to judge whether liquidity is returning evenly. With the good news kicking off a new week, sentiment remains cautious. The Fear and Greed Index in the 20s has historically coincided with two-way trade, where intraday spikes fade unless supported by heavier spot volumes. Stronger closes on days with firmer volumes would mark a healthier repair than squeezes driven by derivatives. A U.S. government shutdown deal can steady rate-cut expectations at the margin and calm collateral stress, but crypto direction has increasingly hinged on whether cash products receive steady allocations rather than on futures-led bursts alone. THE MAN WHO DOES IT ALL. pic.twitter.com/n5RJFDx5RO — The White House (@WhiteHouse) November 10, 2025 Beyond Bitcoin: ETH, SOL, XRP Reads Ethereum tracked the bounce with slightly wider percentage moves, a pattern seen when DeFi-linked activity lifts realized volatility. Flows into or out of ETH-focused vehicles will help determine whether the move extends beyond relief, especially if exchange balances continue to edge lower on spot demand. Solana has drawn attention from product development and discretionary traders. Weekly ETF flow roundups showed relative resilience in SOL-linked vehicles compared with BTC and ETH during recent sessions, hinting that breadth can return if Bitcoin steadies and redemptions slow. XRP often amplifies shifts in majors during stressed weeks. A calmer BTC tape with better depth typically narrows XRP intraday ranges and reduces slippage around event headlines. The near-term test is straightforward. If U.S. spot ETF outflows ease while the shutdown deal moves to signature and long-term holder distribution slows, bidders can build a base with less friction. Until those series turn together, rebounds will continue to meet supply at familiar levels.

The decline is sparking debate across the crypto community, with experts split on whether long-term holders (LTHs) are quietly selling or simply repositioning their funds amid rising concerns about quantum computing threats. Bitcoin Housecleaning or Whale Sell-Off? Data shared by Woo on X shows Taproot addresses, Bitcoin’s latest transaction format, trending downward since early 2024. The analyst explained that this shift might not signal panic selling but rather “housecleaning” by early holders, who are moving BTC to more secure or custodial setups. “What constitutes an ‘OG dump’ is simply BTC moving out of an address untouched for seven years,” Woo wrote, adding that on-chain data can misinterpret such activity as selling when it often reflects reorganization or collateral posting. Fellow analysts, including Charles Edwards of Capriole Investments, countered that large-scale movements by early Bitcoin holders usually correlate with sell pressure. “We know this empirically,” he said, pointing to colorful on-chain charts showing hundreds of millions in old BTC moving in 2025. Others, however, supported Woo’s view. On-chain researcher Shanaka Anslem Perera noted that around 470,000 BTC, worth about $50 billion, has left dormancy this year, but much of that movement involved custody rotations and treasury placements rather than market sales. “The story is not capitulation,” he wrote, “rather it’s custody evolution, collateralization, and an institutional catcher’s mitt.” Quantum Fears Drive Custody Shifts The timing of these Taproot withdrawals has coincided with growing unease over Bitcoin’s long-term resilience against quantum computing attacks. In July 2025, developers proposed “P2QRH,” a quantum-resistant address type aimed at protecting up to 4 million vulnerable BTC, roughly 25% of the supply, from future key exposure risks. The urgency grew after Project Eleven launched its Q-Day Prize challenge in April, offering 1 BTC to anyone who could crack Bitcoin’s cryptography using Shor’s algorithm before April 2026. The experiment, designed to test whether real quantum hardware can threaten Bitcoin’s elliptic curve encryption, reignited debate about how soon the network might face real cryptographic stress. Hardware makers are also responding , with Trezor announcing the Safe 7 wallet, its first “quantum-ready” self-custody device, in October.

The same classification will apply to international payments or transfers made using virtual assets, including those carried out through cards or other electronic payment methods. The regulations are expected to come into effect in February 2026. It is one of the first major moves the central bank has made towards regulating crypto assets and stablecoins since 2022, when the country approved a legal framework for cryptocurrencies, but its implementation rested on complementary regulations that the central bank was expected to provide. Central bank introduces new rules Brazilian authorities have been monitoring the surge in stablecoin transactions, with central bank governor Gabriel Galipolo describing the rise as “significant and worrying.” Earlier this year, Galipolo said around 90% of Brazil’s crypto transaction volume is tied to stablecoins, many of which are being used for payments or to bypass traditional financial systems that are more tightly regulated and taxed. Policymakers say that while stablecoins are less volatile than cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, their increased adoption has created regulatory blind spots. The central bank said it wants to ensure that these assets are no longer used as channels for illicit transfers, tax evasion, or money laundering. “New rules will reduce the scope for scams, fraud, and the use of virtual asset markets for money laundering,” said Gilneu Vivan, the central bank’s director of regulation, at a press conference announcing the measures . Regulatory alignment and compliance challenge The classification of stablecoins as forex operations means that each transaction will now need to adhere to the same disclosure and compliance standards that apply to conventional cross-border currency dealings. This change could increase compliance costs for crypto firms operating in Brazil, but it also provides some form of legitimacy to the sector as it clarifies how virtual assets fit into the national financial framework. Last month, Roberto Campos Neto, the central bank governor, shared that they should be regulating the stablecoins and asset tokenizations next year, and this latest regulatory rollout seems to be the first step in that direction. Jurisdictions roll out stablecoin regulations on a case-by-case basis The central bank’s move positions Brazil among the first large economies to treat stablecoins as foreign exchange instruments, a step that could influence how other jurisdictions deal with similar challenges. Various countries continue to regulate stablecoins and treat them according to their own realities. The US landmark GENIUS Act touches on reserves and anti-money laundering programs. The European Union has the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA); Hong Kong also launched its stablecoin ordinance in August. Singapore and the United Arab Emirates also have frameworks and regulations in place for stablecoins. The stablecoin market is mostly dominated by coins pegged to the US dollar, and Brazil treating stablecoins as forex speaks to this fact. Many nations are trying to work around this by issuing their own e-currencies or stablecoins pegged to their own local currencies.

ETH bulls are now back in control, targeting the $4,500 resistance as the next stop for continuation of the recovery. Analysts at CryptoQuant have observed that since the October 10 sell-off, the Spot Average Order Size metric for Ethereum has increased, a trend that has historically preceded local bottoms and early accumulation phases. Ethereum Whale Bid Flashes Local Bottom Across previous cycles, analysts point out that similar whale accumulation has marked the start of trend reversals or late-stage compression phases before major upswings. Source: CryptoQuant “If this behavior persists and the $3-$3.4K region holds as structural support, Ethereum may be entering a low-volatility accumulation zone, setting up for a potential final bullish impulse toward the upper range of $4.5K–$4.8K.” Ethereum treasury companies have topped the list of institutional whales accumulating Ether to keep its bullish structure intact. In a recent company report, leading Ethereum treasury firm Bitmine Immersion Technologies revealed that it now owns 2.9% of the ETH token supply. The company’s Ethereum holdings now stand at 3,505,723 ETH, worth approximately $12 billion.

On November 10, Canadian-listed company Republic Technologies announced a $100 million convertible note financing, intended to expand its Ethereum staking and reserve operations. Other Nasdaq-listed companies like Sharplink Gaming , The Ether Machine, Bit Digital, and ETHZilla all hold over $6 billion worth of Ethereum, per CoinGecko Tom Lee Says “Best of Ethereum About to Come” as Q4 Momentum Builds Thomas “Tom” Lee of Fundstrat, chairman of BitMine, said that “The recent dip in ETH prices presented an attractive opportunity and BitMine increased its ETH purchases this week.” Tom Lee believes that the best of Ethereum is about to come as the company keeps accumulating what it believes is the “tokenization layer” for Wall Street’s transition from TradFi to the on-chain economy.

Ethereum whales are now entering long setups in anticipation of a massive rally. An insider whale known for his 100% win rate is now adding more to his ETH long position, with order size now worth $194.3 million. This adds to the conviction from other bulls that ETH is heading to the $4,500-$4,800 range. ETH Eyes $5,058 if $3,520 Support Holds The Ethereum (ETH/USD) daily chart shows the formation of a potential double-bottom pattern, a classic bullish reversal sign. The two labeled lows (“Bottom 1” and “Bottom 2”) suggest that buyers have defended the $3,500–$3,520 region twice, indicating strong demand at that zone. The neckline of the pattern aligns near the descending trendline resistance, which ETH appears to be testing after a brief breakout attempt. The ascending green trendline from the previous rally acts as structural support, and price reclaiming this level reinforces bullish sentiment. Source: TradingView Additionally, the Fibonacci retracement levels show multiple resistance targets at $3,888, $4,069, and $4,261, with a broader breakout target projected toward $5,058 if momentum sustains. Volume activity shows accumulation near the second bottom, a typical sign of buyers stepping back in after exhaustion of selling pressure. Overall, the chart setup leans bullish. If Ethereum can hold above $3,520 and break decisively above $3,800, it could confirm the double-bottom breakout and aim for the $4,200–$5,000 range.

However, when this stopgap budget vote faces uncertainty, it triggers concerns across multiple sectors. Government agencies, federal employees, and contractors all depend on the certainty that comes with successful budget approvals. Leader Thune’s comments highlight the political challenges in reaching consensus. The stopgap budget vote requires bipartisan support, and current divisions make the outcome unpredictable. This uncertainty affects more than just political negotiations—it impacts real people and services. What Are the Immediate Consequences of Vote Uncertainty?

Many government programs operate on tight deadlines, and any delay in funding approval creates cascading effects throughout the system. How Does This Stopgap Budget Vote Impact Broader Economic Stability? Beyond immediate government operations, the uncertainty surrounding this stopgap budget vote sends ripples through financial markets. Investors monitor these developments closely because government stability directly influences economic confidence. The stopgap budget vote serves as a barometer for political cooperation and fiscal responsibility. Historical patterns show that when stopgap budget votes face delays or uncertainty, market volatility often increases. This particular stopgap budget vote carries additional weight given current economic conditions and global uncertainties. What Solutions Could Break the Impasse? Several approaches could resolve the stopgap budget vote uncertainty: Bipartisan negotiations to address key concerns Modified legislation that addresses opposition points Extended deadlines for more comprehensive discussions Compromise provisions that satisfy multiple stakeholders The path forward for this stopgap budget vote requires political will and practical compromise.

Stopgap measures typically happen several times per year when Congress cannot agree on full-year funding bills by deadlines. Can the stopgap budget vote be rescheduled?

Analysts suggest that recent developments regarding the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) review could deliver the final nail in the coffin for XRP. With ETF filings still awaiting approval, the market is watching closely, as a green light could pave the way to greater mainstream adoption and institutional investment in XRP. XRP ETF To Become Game-Changer For The Market Nate Geraci, President of NovaDius Wealth Management and co-founder of The ETF Institute, recently stated on X social media that the first Spot XRP ETF could launch within the next two weeks. He described this event as the “final nail in the coffin” for the previous wave of anti-crypto regulators. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts XRP Price Will Decouple From Bitcoin, Here’s What Would Happen Notably, the US SEC had been involved in litigation against Ripple for five years, which concluded about three months ago. Geraci believes that the approval of a Spot XRP ETF represents a significant step forward for not only XRP but also the broader cryptocurrency industry. The temporary delay caused by the US government shutdown, which started in October, has pushed back XRP ETF approvals. However, new reports of bipartisan efforts to reopen government operations have reignited expectations of an ETF. Geraci pointed out in a subsequent X post that the end of the government shutdown could unleash a wave of crypto ETF launches, with a 33 Act spot XRP ETF likely coming this week. Recently, the US Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) listed nine new Spot XRP ETFs on its platform, increasing expectations of a launch this November. The list includes XRP ETFs from top asset managers such as Bitwise, Franklin Templeton, Canary Capital, Volatility Shares, CoinShares, T-Rex Osprey, 21Shares, and many others. ETF Filing Amendment Brings Launch Closer Than Ever Further evidence that an XRP ETF may be imminent comes from recent filing updates by leading issuers. Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, reported that 21Shares has submitted an 8(a) form with the US SEC on November 7 for its spot XRP ETF. The new changes in the filing officially activate a 20-day countdown for the approval and launch of an XRP ETF by November 27. Related Reading: Rare Chart Formation That Led To An 87% XRP Price Crash Has Resurfaced Crypto commentator John Squire also noted that if the US SEC does not take action within the allotted period, the approval would automatically proceed. Similarly, multiple issuers, including Canary Capital, have also withdrawn “delaying amendments,” triggering the same 20-day automatic approval countdown. Notably, these filings suggest that the market is moving closer to a regulatory green light for XRP ETFs. Amid recent developments, Squire has pointed out that the US has never been this close to fully approving an XRP ETF. Should the SEC give its authorization, it could significantly transform trading volume, liquidity, and institutional participation in the market. It would also expand the current major ETF offerings beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Reports of a Senate breakthrough to fund key departments and reopen government operations triggered a wave of investor confidence after the 40-day standoff, the longest in U.S. history. Shutdown Breakthrough Sparks Crypto Relief Rally The U.S. Senate decision marked Bitcoin’s strongest rebound in nearly a week, lifting the broader crypto market’s capitalization to $3.58 trillion, up 4.8% in 24 hours. Ethereum rose 6.9% to $3,618, while XRP, Solana, Dogecoin, and Cardano each gained more than 4%, signaling renewed bullish sentiment. Analysts noted that the end of the shutdown could restore liquidity and encourage institutional inflows, particularly after eight sessions of ETF outflows totaling more than $2 billion. “Relief in Washington has translated into relief on the charts,” said market analyst Abhay H., who projects short-term upside targets between $108,000 and $110,000 if momentum holds above $105,000. Whales Accumulate $32 Billion as Support Strengthens On-chain data revealed that Bitcoin whales , addresses holding between 10,000 and 100,000 BTC, accumulated more than 300,000 BTC worth approximately $32 billion after prices briefly dipped below $101,000. This large-scale accumulation helped reinforce the $105,000 support zone, offsetting broader market weakness. The Realized Profit/Loss ratio remains elevated at 9.1, suggesting holders are still comfortably in profit despite volatility. Analysts believe the buying spree demonstrates “deep conviction” among long-term investors. “Whales have effectively turned $105K into the new line in the sand,” said Glassnode researchers, adding that structural demand remains robust even amid reduced ETF inflows. Technical signals back this trend. Bitcoin continues to defend its 365-day moving average, a key historical support that also held during the 2024 yen-carry crisis and the 2025 tariff shock. Bitcoin (BTC) Traders Watch $111K–$113K Resistance Zone While momentum indicators show Bitcoin entering neutral territory, traders are now eyeing $111,000 and $113,000 as the next resistance levels. A clear break above that range could open the path toward the 138.2% Fibonacci extension target near $133,900. Market sentiment has further been buoyed by speculation that MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor may be preparing another major Bitcoin purchase following his cryptic “₿est Continue” post. Combined with expectations of potential Fed rate cuts before 2026, these catalysts are helping reinforce Bitcoin’s recovery narrative heading into year-end. Currently, Bitcoin (BTC) trades at $106,448, up 4.3% over 24 hours, signaling that the bulls may indeed be back in control.

He cites a live on-air moment where CNBC seemingly allowed the cat out of the bag: “You got a couple of XRP ETFs coming through .” That alone has stirred a mixture of anticipation and scrutiny among market professionals. The Signal That Echoed Bull Winkle frames the clip as a watershed: “CNBC, they just did it,” he states. He argues this is “the first mainstream confirmation that XRP ETFs are real”. The phrasing suggests a shift from speculation into tangible expectation. If true, this transition mirrors what happened with spot Bitcoin ETFs—first whispers, then filings, then launches. Filings, Regulatory Milestones, and Timing Behind the tone of social media lies solid groundwork. Several asset managers – notably Bitwise Asset Management – have amended their municipal S-1 filings to remove delay language, thus enabling automatic effectiveness once the statutory window expires. CNBC Just Confirmed #XRP ETFs pic.twitter.com/TDUYp9bdj6 — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) November 10, 2025 These filings point to a tight calendar in mid-November. Activity at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) level, combined with index-provider entries and the clearing of operational hurdles, suggests readiness rather than mere optimism. Why It Matters for XRP If spot XRP ETFs launch, institutional capital and passive-investment themes could flow into the token at scale. Bull Winkle warns: “When that happens, you’re not early anymore, you are just ahead of the headlines.” The implication is that early positioning might yield outsized returns before the broader market reacts. In other words, this is not merely about the product launch—it’s about the paradigm of adoption shifting. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Risks and Caveats Ahead Despite the optimism, several variables remain. Even with filings cleared, actual first-trades depend on SEC approval, exchange listings, custodian readiness, and index inclusion. A date on the calendar—November 13—is frequently cited , though Bull Winkle frames it as a marker to “circle” rather than an ironclad guarantee. In regulatory-heavy environments, “expectation” and “effective launch” are different variables. Reading Between the Lines The clip from CNBC, amplified by Bull Winkle, acts as social evidence. That matters because perceptions drive flows. But the more enduring driver is filings, index registrations, and structural readiness. So far, the narrative appears aligned. Market participants are merging social fuel with procedural indicators. Final Thoughts The claim that “you’ve got a couple of XRP ETFs coming through,” as captured by Bull Winkle, has ignited the conversation and lifted sentiment. But the most meaningful confirmation will come with a ticker symbol on an exchange and volume crossing the thresholds of liquidity. Until then, this remains very much a “pre-launch phase”—but potentially one whose impact may begin in days. Disclaimer: This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This strategic move aims to enhance token value while streamlining operations across the ecosystem. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and UNI token holders, this represents one of the most significant developments in decentralized finance governance this year. What Does the UNI Token Supply Proposal Actually Mean? The core of the proposal focuses on reducing the UNI token supply through strategic fee allocation. Instead of maintaining the current token distribution model, the plan redirects a portion of protocol fees toward value-enhancing mechanisms. This approach represents a fundamental shift in how Uniswap manages its token economics. The proposal includes two primary allocation methods for these fees: UNI buybacks and burns to directly reduce circulating supply Growth budget allocation to fund ecosystem development How Will the UNI Token Supply Changes Benefit Holders? Reducing the UNI token supply through strategic mechanisms creates several immediate benefits for token holders. First, the buyback and burn approach directly decreases circulating tokens, potentially increasing scarcity and value. Second, the growth budget ensures continued development and innovation within the Uniswap ecosystem. Moreover, the operational consolidation brings efficiency improvements. By transferring most Foundation projects to Uniswap Labs, the ecosystem eliminates redundancy and streamlines decision-making. This consolidation should accelerate development timelines and improve resource allocation. What Challenges Could Impact the UNI Token Supply Transition? While the proposal offers significant benefits, several challenges require careful consideration. Governance participation remains crucial – the community must actively vote and guide implementation. Additionally, the transition period during Foundation wind-down requires meticulous planning to ensure project continuity. The fee allocation mechanism also presents technical challenges. Implementing automated buybacks and burns requires robust smart contract development and security audits. Similarly, determining the optimal split between burn mechanisms and growth funding demands careful economic analysis. Why This UNI Token Supply Move Matters for DeFi This proposal represents a maturation of decentralized finance governance models. By implementing token supply management mechanisms typically seen in traditional finance, Uniswap demonstrates DeFi’s evolving sophistication. The move could set a precedent for other protocols considering similar token economic improvements. The decision to reduce UNI token supply through protocol fees also creates a sustainable value accrual mechanism. Unlike one-time token burns, this approach establishes ongoing value enhancement tied directly to protocol usage and performance. What’s Next for the UNI Token Supply Proposal? The governance process will determine the proposal’s fate. UNI token holders must vote on the changes, with implementation following successful community approval. The timeline includes several phases: Community discussion and feedback collection Formal governance proposal submission Token holder voting period Technical implementation if approved Successful implementation could fundamentally transform UNI token economics, creating a more deflationary model while maintaining ecosystem growth funding. Frequently Asked Questions How will the UNI token supply reduction affect token price? The reduced UNI token supply through buybacks and burns could create scarcity, potentially supporting price appreciation, though market conditions remain influential. When will the UNI token supply changes take effect? Implementation depends on governance approval and technical development, likely occurring over several months following successful voting. What happens to the Uniswap Foundation during this transition? The Foundation will wind down operations after transferring ongoing projects to Uniswap Labs, ensuring continuity for ecosystem development. How can UNI token holders participate in governance? Token holders can vote through Uniswap’s governance portal using their UNI tokens to influence protocol decisions. Will the UNI token supply reduction impact protocol fees? User trading fees remain unchanged; the proposal redirects a portion of existing protocol revenue toward supply management. What safeguards ensure proper fund allocation? Transparent on-chain mechanisms and community oversight through governance provide accountability for fund distribution. Found this analysis of UNI token supply changes helpful?

54245108,https://nulltx.com/?p=152623,1762808188,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Coinbase Opens Token Sale Platform for U.S. Retail Investor,https://nulltx.com/coinbase-opens-token-sale-platform-for-u-s-retail-investors/,"After a long wait, Coinbase is bringing token sales back to the public, and this time, retail investors in the United States are finally included. The exchange has launched a new Coinbase Token Sales Platform, designed to give users early access to new crypto projects in a regulated, transparent environment. For the first time since 2018, U.S. traders can participate in public token launches directly through Coinbase. The move marks a major step in Coinbase’s push to make token distribution fairer, safer, and more accessible, especially to users previously excluded from such opportunities due to regulatory constraints. Monad to Debut as the First Project via Coinbase Launchpad The first token sale on the platform will be Monad ($MON), a high-performance blockchain project set to launch on November 17, 2025 via Coinbase Launchpad. Monad aims to deliver extreme scalability and efficiency in decentralized computing, and its upcoming sale is expected to draw significant interest. According to Coinbase, the new token launch format focuses on three key promises: Early access to promising new tokens Prioritization of real supporters over speculative traders Sustainable token distribution that rewards long-term holders Full inclusion of U.S. users for the first time in years The sale represents a symbolic moment, one that reconnects the largest U.S. crypto exchange with grassroots participation in token launches. Token launches just got a whole lot better. → Early access to your favorite tokens → Real supporters are prioritized → Sustainable token distribution → US users can finally join Now possible with token sales on Coinbase. Oh, one more thing: the @monad sale starts Nov 17. pic.twitter.com/ox5VRAqfiH — Coinbase (@coinbase) November 10, 2025 Inside the Monad Sale Here’s what’s confirmed for the Monad Token Sale: Token Supply: 100 billion MON Sale Price: $0.025 per MON Tokens Available for Sale: 7.5 billion MON (7.5% of total supply) Start Date: November 17, 2025, 2:00 PM UTC End Date: November 23, 2025, 2:00 AM UTC Minimum Bid: $100 Maximum Bid: $100,000 Distribution: Tokens delivered during the TGE (Token Generation Event) Coinbase also stated that higher maximum limits may apply for Coinbase One subscribers, providing additional flexibility for premium members. The sale will be accessible globally, including the United States, a first for Coinbase-hosted token launches in years. Premarket trading for MON currently hovers around $0.048, almost double the public sale price, reflecting strong early interest. Announcing the MON public sale: the first ever token sale on Coinbase The sale starts on November 17th and will be accessible in over 80 countries, including the U.S. More details below pic.twitter.com/lOs7fv11kF — Monad (mainnet arc) (@monad) November 10, 2025 Monad Tokenomics Breakdown Monad has also released full details of its tokenomics, emphasizing a balanced distribution model aimed at long-term network growth. Day 1 Supply: 49.4 billion MON (49.4% of total) Public Sale: 7.5 billion MON (7.5%), Fully unlocked at TGE Airdrop: 3.3 billion MON (3.3%), Fully unlocked Ecosystem Development: 38.5 billion MON (38.5%), Fully unlocked The remaining 50.6 billion MON (50.6%) will be allocated to team members, investors, and the Category Labs treasury. These tokens will be subject to a vesting schedule between 1 and 4 years, ensuring that early stakeholders stay aligned with the project’s long-term vision. This structure signals an intent to maintain sustainable growth rather than short-term hype, a principle Coinbase appears committed to through its new token sales model. Coinbase Offers A New Era for Retail Access For U.S. crypto traders, the launch represents more than just another sale, it’s a reopening of an entire market segment that’s been closed since the 2017–2018 ICO boom. Back then, regulatory uncertainty forced most platforms to restrict U.S. users from participating in token sales. Coinbase’s re-entry into this space signals renewed confidence that compliant frameworks now exist to include retail participants safely. By hosting token launches under its regulated umbrella, Coinbase is attempting to rebuild trust in public offerings, while giving users a fair shot at early-stage projects without relying on offshore exchanges. The introduction of the Coinbase Token Sales Platform could reshape how mainstream investors gain access to new crypto opportunities. Transparency: Token allocations, sale mechanics, and distribution schedules are fully disclosed, reducing the risk of opaque or manipulated launches. Compliance: Every sale will operate under Coinbase’s U.S. regulatory standards, setting a precedent for legal token distribution. Fair Participation: The platform prioritizes genuine community members over bots and speculative traders, aligning with the broader “fair launch” ethos in crypto. For Coinbase, the launch is also a competitive play against global exchanges like Binance Launchpad and Bitget Launchpad, which have dominated the token sale landscape. The difference: Coinbase is bringing that model into regulated territory, giving American investors a seat at the table once again. A Revival of the Launchpad Model Coinbase’s move revives the launchpad model that once defined early crypto growth cycles. By curating token sales and providing infrastructure, Coinbase aims to combine investor safety with innovation access, something the industry has struggled to balance. Analysts believe this could mark the beginning of a broader shift toward compliant public sales. “It’s not about chasing hype, it’s about rebuilding participation,” one observer noted. “Coinbase is positioning itself as the bridge between regulation and innovation.” If successful, the platform could become a central venue for both emerging projects and investors seeking early exposure under trusted conditions. The timing of Coinbase’s announcement is also telling. As institutional interest in digital assets grows and U.S. regulators gradually clarify their stance on token distribution, Coinbase is positioning itself at the forefront of compliant token launches. With Monad as the debut sale, the exchange is signaling a commitment to high-quality projects and transparent terms, a formula that could redefine how tokens enter the market. For investors, it means something simple but powerful: The ability to participate in crypto’s next wave, legally, securely, and onshore. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Acting Chair Caroline Pham confirmed the move in a post on X, writing “True” in response to a CoinDesk report that revealed the agency is in direct talks with multiple CFTC-regulated exchanges to launch spot crypto trading products, including margin and financing options. True https://t.co/4VjzyEuklE — Caroline D. Pham (@CarolineDPham) November 9, 2025 She confirmed the report even as other crypto-related policymaking remains stalled amid Washington’s historic government shutdown. CME, Cboe, Coinbase, and Others in Talks with CFTC Plan The talks involve major financial players such as CME Group, Cboe Futures Exchange, and ICE Futures, alongside crypto-native platforms Coinbase Derivatives, Kalshi, and Polymarket U.S., to finalize details of new trading offerings that could be approved before the end of the year. Pham told CoinDesk that the agency is “using existing authorities to swiftly implement recommendations” from the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, emphasizing that progress will continue while Congress works on broader legislative clarity for digital assets. If implemented, the plan would bring leveraged crypto trading, long available on offshore exchanges, onto U.S.-regulated platforms for the first time. The products would operate under full commodities law, with oversight mechanisms already used in futures and derivatives markets, providing a framework for risk management, margin requirements, and investor protections. The plan represents a sharp turn from the CFTC’s historical caution on leveraged spot products. Source: CFTC Until now, retail spot trading involving leverage or margin was largely confined to offshore exchanges due to the “actual delivery” restrictions under the Commodity Exchange Act. These rules require that leveraged commodity transactions result in actual delivery of the asset within 28 days, a standard that has long created regulatory uncertainty for crypto assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. By bringing such trading onto Designated Contract Markets (DCMs), the CFTC is attempting to create a regulated onshore alternative. The approach could strengthen investor protection, improve risk management, and potentially make digital assets more attractive to institutional investors seeking exposure through regulated venues. The upcoming leveraged products would likely focus on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), which the CFTC classifies as commodities. CFTC’s Crypto Overhaul Marks Shift From Turf Wars to Coordination With SEC The Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC) push to approve leveraged spot crypto trading comes as the agency undergoes major internal changes. Acting Chair Caroline Pham, who is expected to be replaced by SEC crypto official Mike Selig, nominated by President Donald Trump, has been restructuring the agency and advancing a “crypto sprint” to accelerate digital asset policy. Pham has also championed a proposal to allow stablecoins to serve as tokenized collateral in derivatives markets , a move she described as a “killer app” for modernizing collateral management. The initiative is expected to enter a pilot phase early next year. The announcement coincides with the resolution of the longest U.S. government shutdown in history, which had paralyzed financial regulators for over a month. BREAKING: Republicans and enough Senate Democrats have reached a deal to end the government shutdown after 40 days, a source familiar tells FOX News. pic.twitter.com/8boVTBPjjO — Fox News (@FoxNews) November 10, 2025 A new Senate deal will allow agencies such as the CFTC and SEC to resume normal operations and address a backlog of pending crypto rulemaking and spot ETF applications. The reopening is also expected to revive legislative efforts, including the bipartisan CLARITY Act , which seeks to define how digital assets are regulated across federal agencies. Despite the shutdown, Pham continued discussions with exchanges and financial institutions about launching new spot products , reflecting growing confidence that the CFTC already has legal authority to oversee such markets. Her efforts follow renewed cooperation between U.S. regulators. In late September, Pham and SEC officials publicly declared an end to their long-running “turf war.” “It’s a new day,” Pham said at a roundtable with executives from Kraken, Polymarket, and Kalshi.

While Bitcoin remains dominant, tokens like XRP , Hedera (HBAR) , and RentStac (RNS) are stealing the spotlight thanks to their focus on scalability, utility, and verifiable adoption. Each represents a unique angle in the broader evolution of decentralized finance and enterprise blockchain integration. XRP: Banking Meets Blockchain Efficiency Ripple’s XRP continues to define the bridge between traditional finance and digital assets. After securing a series of legal and regulatory milestones, XRP is expanding its on-demand liquidity network, enabling faster and cheaper cross-border transactions for banks and payment providers. Recent partnerships with financial institutions in Asia and the Middle East have revived investor confidence, positioning XRP as the go-to token for institutional-grade settlements. Analysts note that as global adoption of ISO 20022 messaging standards expands, XRP could experience renewed volume growth and long-term stability. HBAR: Real-World Integration at Scale Hedera (HBAR) is quietly proving that enterprise blockchain adoption is no longer a dream. The network’s unique hashgraph technology offers high throughput, low fees, and strong governance from global giants like Google, IBM, and Boeing. Over 40 major corporations now use Hedera for real-world applications, from supply chain tracking to carbon credit tokenization. HBAR’s focus on compliance, sustainability, and performance is solidifying its role as one of the most trusted infrastructures for large-scale Web3 solutions. RentStac (RNS): Real Yield From Real Assets While XRP and HBAR strengthen existing networks, RentStac (RNS) is charting a new path by merging blockchain with real-world income generation. The project tokenizes real estate properties into fractionalized digital shares, allowing investors to earn monthly stablecoin yields directly from rental income. This model combines the transparency of DeFi with the security and consistency of tangible assets. With more than $650,000 raised during its ongoing presale and tokens priced at $0.025 , early investors are positioning for potentially massive upside once the platform’s marketplace launches. Institutional Confidence and Transparent Security What sets RentStac (RNS) apart is its commitment to audited security and full compliance. The platform achieved a 92.48% audit score from SolidityScan, and a CertiK review is underway. Each property is held through a legally structured SPV with KYC and AML protocols, ensuring that tokenized ownership remains verifiable and compliant across jurisdictions. This transparency has helped build confidence among both retail and professional investors exploring the emerging real-world asset (RWA) narrative. The Broader Market Narrative: Utility Over Hype Across the entire crypto landscape, the common thread connecting XRP , HBAR , and RentStac (RNS) is utility. Investors are increasingly prioritizing projects with proven frameworks, stable revenue models, and regulatory alignment. The current rally signals a maturing market phase where speculation gives way to substance. From cross-border payments and enterprise-grade ledgers to income-generating real estate tokens, these projects are leading the charge toward a more sustainable crypto economy. A Glimpse Into the Future of Crypto Investment The resurgence of high-utility altcoins marks a turning point for the industry. As DeFi evolves beyond hype, projects capable of bridging the digital and physical economies are expected to dominate the next bull cycle. XRP , HBAR , and RentStac (RNS) are proving that blockchain technology can drive measurable value in both finance and the real world. The momentum is already building, and with presales and partnerships accelerating across these ecosystems, investors are watching closely. For those seeking exposure to the future of functional crypto innovation, RentStac (RNS) stands as one of the most promising early-stage opportunities.

As Bitcoin stabilizes near $100K, altcoins are gaining momentum, with ETH once again leading the charge. The recovery comes amid renewed optimism across the crypto sector, as traders and investors position for potential upside following weeks of correction and fear-driven selling. Related Reading: SharpLink Gaming Wallet Moves Freshly Redeemed Ethereum to OKX – Details According to a CryptoQuant report by analyst Darkfost, Ethereum trading volume has reached record highs on Binance, highlighting the speculative nature of the current market. The report notes that speculation now plays a much larger role than in previous cycles, with trading activity at unprecedented levels. In contrast to past bullish phases — when spot market activity dominated and provided a healthier foundation for growth — today’s rally appears heavily fueled by leverage and short-term speculation. This shift has made the market more volatile and less stable, even as prices recover. Speculation Dominates as Ethereum Trading Activity Hits Unprecedented Levels According to CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost, the Ethereum market is now driven by speculation more than ever before, as traders pursue quick returns rather than sustainable growth. This shift in behavior has created a far less stable trading environment, with volatility and leverage increasingly shaping price action. Data shows that across centralized exchanges (CeX), both trading volumes and open interest have reached historic highs. On Binance, Ethereum trading volumes have already surpassed $6 trillion in 2025, roughly two to three times higher than in previous years. Other major exchanges show similar patterns, but Binance continues to dominate market activity by a wide margin, underscoring its position as the primary venue for speculative ETH trading. Open interest levels also tell a striking story. In August 2025, ETH open interest exceeded $12.5 billion on Binance — a staggering fivefold increase compared to the previous all-time high of $2.5 billion in November 2021. This explosion in leveraged positions highlights the extent to which Ethereum trading has evolved into a highly speculative environment dominated by short-term positioning. Altogether, these trends reveal a market structure increasingly reliant on derivatives rather than spot buying. As Darkfost notes, this cycle’s speculative intensity makes Ethereum’s price dynamics far more fragile and reactive, explaining the frequent sharp swings and heightened sensitivity to liquidity shifts that now define the ETH market. Related Reading: Cardano Whales Trim Positions – 4M ADA Sold in 7 Days Testing Key Resistance After Sharp Sell-Off Ethereum (ETH) is showing early signs of recovery following last week’s sharp decline, as the price rebounds from lows near $3,200 to trade around $3,590 at the time of writing. The rebound follows a strong reaction from buyers after multiple days of heavy selling pressure, hinting at renewed confidence in the market. From a technical perspective, ETH’s recent bounce suggests that short-term momentum may be shifting back toward the bulls. The daily chart shows a clear structure of higher lows forming, but Ethereum still faces immediate resistance near the $3,650–$3,700 zone, which aligns with the previous consolidation area before the breakdown. A decisive close above this level could open the door for a move toward $3,850–$3,900, while failure to break higher may signal continued consolidation.

54245323,624581,1762808455,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54245323.jpeg,Stablecoin Supply Begins to Shrink As Bitcoin Reclaims $105K: Liquidity Cooling?,https://bitcoinist.com/stablecoin-supply-shrink-bitcoin-reclaims-105k/,"Bitcoin (BTC) is staging a recovery after a sharp decline that briefly pushed prices below the $100,000 mark, sparking widespread fear across the market. The move triggered a wave of liquidations and panic selling, but BTC has since bounced back, trading above $105,000 as investors eye potential relief from the looming U.S. government shutdown. Market participants appear cautiously optimistic, with short-term sentiment improving as risk appetite returns. However, data from CryptoQuant reveals a key development that could influence Bitcoin’s next move — stablecoin supply is starting to slip. After months of steady growth, the total stablecoin market capitalization has begun trending downward, signaling a potential cooling in liquidity. Historically, shrinking stablecoin reserves on exchanges tend to precede lower buying pressure, as less capital is available to rotate into crypto assets. Still, the broader picture remains mixed. While Bitcoin’s price structure shows signs of stabilization, underlying liquidity trends hint that market conditions could remain fragile. If government action helps ease macroeconomic uncertainty and risk flows stabilize, BTC could extend its rebound. But if liquidity continues tightening, volatility may return sooner than expected, especially as the market digests shifting global sentiment. Stablecoin Contraction Signals Caution — or Capital Rotation? According to top analyst Maartunn, data from CryptoQuant shows a notable shift in market liquidity conditions. His chart comparing USDT Market Cap Change with Bitcoin’s price reveals that after several months of consistent expansion, the total stablecoin market capitalization is now trending downward. Historically, such a contraction has often acted as an early warning sign of cooling liquidity in the crypto market — meaning less fresh capital is entering the ecosystem. Stablecoins, particularly USDT, play a crucial role in fueling market momentum. When their supply grows, it typically reflects increased buying power and capital inflows. Conversely, a shrinking supply can indicate a pause in demand or a period of risk aversion among investors. This decline could therefore be interpreted as a sign that traders are pulling liquidity out of the system, potentially reducing Bitcoin’s short-term upside potential. However, several analysts argue that this recent trend may not signal weakness but rather capital rotation. As Bitcoin stabilizes above $100,000 and altcoins show renewed volatility, part of the stablecoin supply might be moving into risk assets like Ethereum or emerging DeFi plays instead of exiting the market entirely. If this interpretation holds true, the drop in stablecoin supply may simply mark a transition phase, where capital flows shift within the ecosystem rather than retreating from it. This dynamic would support a more neutral outlook — suggesting that liquidity is being redistributed rather than disappearing. Bitcoin Eyes Recovery but Faces Key Resistance Levels Bitcoin (BTC) has managed to recover from last week’s steep decline, with price action stabilizing above $105,000 after dipping below the critical $100,000 level. As seen in the chart, BTC has formed a short-term reversal structure, bouncing from a local low near $98,000 and showing signs of renewed buying pressure. This recovery, however, still faces a cluster of resistance levels between $108,000 and $112,000, where previous rallies have repeatedly stalled. Trading volume has increased moderately during the rebound, indicating that some capital is flowing back into the market — though not yet at levels suggesting strong conviction. The market remains cautious, with traders watching to see if Bitcoin can reclaim the 50-day moving average, which currently acts as dynamic resistance around $110,000. If BTC breaks and consolidates above that zone, it could trigger a more meaningful recovery toward $117,000–$120,000. However, failure to maintain momentum may lead to another retest of support near $100,000.

The company announced that it had reached an agreement with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) to renew its Title V Air Permit for its Dresden, New York facility, ending a years-long legal battle that once threatened its operations in the state. Source: Google Finance The five-year permit, finalized on Friday, allows Greenidge to continue running its combined power-generation and cryptocurrency-mining operation while committing to substantial emissions cuts that go beyond state climate targets. Greenidge to Slash Emissions 44% by 2030 Under New York Settlement Under the terms, Greenidge must cut its permitted greenhouse gas output by 44% from prior limits and its actual emissions by 25% by 2030, surpassing the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act’s (CLCPA) statewide reduction goal of 40%. “This new permit includes historic emissions reductions that go far beyond anything required by the CLCPA,” said company president Dale Irwin, calling the deal proof that Greenidge can operate as a “responsible cryptocurrency business” that supports the grid during peak demand while remaining environmentally compliant. Source: Greenidge The agreement marks a dramatic turnaround from 2022, when the state initially denied Greenidge’s air permit renewal after environmental backlash. The decision sparked a lengthy legal dispute that ended in late 2024 , when a New York Supreme Court judge ruled in Greenidge’s favor. The new settlement formally ends all outstanding lawsuits and administrative appeals between the company and the state, allowing operations to proceed without interruption. Regulators said the new permit brings the facility fully in line with state climate law and marks the first such condition in a Title V renewal requiring actual emissions reductions by a specific percentage. Greenidge’s Dresden site operates as both a power producer and Bitcoin miner, capable of diverting power to the state grid within minutes, a sharp improvement from the 14-hour response time in 2022. The company said it has steadily increased grid contributions since then, strengthening energy reliability for upstate residents. The agreement was praised by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), which represents many of the site’s employees. Greenidge Reduces Debt Load and Expands Power Operations Greenidge originally purchased the Dresden facility in 2016, converting it from a coal-fired plant into a natural gas-powered operation that began supplying electricity to the grid in 2017. The company launched its Bitcoin mining activities in 2019, operating a behind-the-meter data center powered entirely by its own generation. Since the purchase, Greenidge has invested more than $100 million in modernizing the site and now contributes nearly 10% of all local tax revenue in Yates County. The company’s renewed footing in New York comes amid broader efforts to strengthen its balance sheet and refocus operations. Earlier this month, Greenidge completed tender and exchange offers for its 8.50% Senior Notes due 2026, reducing outstanding debt through cash payments and exchanges for new 10.00% Senior Notes maturing in 2030. Greenidge Generation Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: GREE) closed the sale of its Mississippi Bitcoin mining facility for $3.9M, with proceeds aimed at business growth. 2Q25 revenue: $12.9M, flat Y/Y; debt cut from $60M to $45M Cash: $3.4M + $7.3M in Bitcoin at quarter-end … pic.twitter.com/sU6Vy0hF8G — Water Tower Research LLC (@WTR_Research) September 18, 2025 In September, Greenidge sold its Mississippi mining facility for $3.9 million, following the termination of a planned sale in South Carolina, where it now plans to explore new development opportunities. Source: Greenidge For the second quarter of 2025, the company reported a net loss of $4.1 million on $12.9 million in revenue, with energy availability at its Dresden plant reaching 99.6%. The miner has also been expanding beyond Bitcoin. Through its GreenidgeAI initiative, the company seeks to repurpose part of its infrastructure to meet the growing demand for AI-focused GPU hosting. Also, it continues to explore acquisitions of additional low-cost power sites across states like South Carolina and North Dakota.

For years, EU officials were proud of sweeping privacy protections; it was treated like the bloc’s moral high ground, and citizens were told their private lives would not be traded away for convenience or novelty. Those days may be ending. The Commission argues that the aim is simplification, cutting back the thicket of new rules that have arrived in rapid succession. However, activists who have read the fine print say the story is far less clean. Big techs have accused the EU laws of being anti-innovation Under the proposals, major platforms could be allowed to take personal information and feed it into artificial intelligence training on the basis of “legitimate interest.” If this stands, it would be a major change from today’s reading of the law, which demands explicit consent for many categories of sensitive information. Groups that have fought Brussels battles for years are now sounding the loudest alarm. The Austrian organisation NOYB said this bundle of revisions amounts to death by a thousand cuts. Max Schrems, the campaigner whose legal challenges helped build GDPR into a global symbol, called it a “massive downgrading of Europeans’ privacy”. A second set of amendments concerns the cookie regime , the same rules that turned the internet into a forest of pop-up choices. Under the draft, the whole piece of legislation could be absorbed into GDPR, and access to phones, laptops, or connected devices could be based on loose permissions, such as a company’s need to detect fraud or measure audiences. Itxaso Dominguez de Olazabal, from the European Digital Rights network, said this would change how Europe protects the private spaces inside personal devices. This is not happening in a vacuum; the US government has been accusing EU law of being anti-innovation, with several firms like Meta found on the wrong side of the law. Big tech companies have been lobbying across the continent to soften the Artificial Intelligence Act, arguing that fast-moving tools cannot survive inside a slow bureaucratic cage. The Commission insists it is not surrendering principles, only removing unnecessary paperwork. There will be a presentation on 19 November, though the document could still shift before then. One clear sign of the new direction is the suggestion that companies using artificial intelligence only for internal, narrow tasks would not have to register systems in an EU database for high-risk AI. Another is a one-year grace period on fines, on deepfakes and synthetic media, providers would have extra time before they must permanently tag their output as machine-generated. The EU wants to appear flexible The Commission has done something similar recently in environmental law, climate requirements that only months ago were described as essential have now been loosened, and businesses have welcomed the retreat. Critics say industry intimidation is working. Europe’s political class is nervous about investment drying up, and it is hunting for ways to appear flexible. Supporters of the AI law admit privately that they worry more about falling behind the United States and China than they did when they first drafted the text. Those forces haunt every regulatory argument today. The question now is whether member states and the Parliament will accept this turn, as many in Brussels know the symbolism is dangerous. If Europe weakens the privacy flag it has flown for a decade, the story of the GDPR may not end as the continent imagined, a beacon of values, copied by others. It may instead become another example of grand talk that could not survive the heat of commercial power. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

According to the data, big whales turned to aggressive accumulation after the ADA price dropped below $0.50 last week. “Cardano's critical token holders are rapidly filling their wallets,” Santiment said, noting that whale and shark wallets have amassed 348 million ADA ($204.3 million) over the past four days. During this period, these addresses purchased 0.94% of the total ADA supply. Cardano's performance in the third quarter of 2025 also supports the positive outlook. The ecosystem closed the quarter strong, recording growth in NFT, DeFi, and stablecoin verticals. Related News: What Will Happen to Bitcoin and Altcoins if the US Government Shutdown Ends? - XRP Spot ETF Hype Begins The increase in liquidity on the DeFi side was notable: Total value locked (TVL) increased by 17.6% quarter-over-quarter to $341.6 million. This growth was driven by the expansion of Liqwid and the increasing diversity of protocols. The circulating supply of ADA continues to grow in a controlled manner until it reaches a maximum of 45 billion tokens. At the end of each five-day epoch, 0.3% of the ADA in reserves is distributed as rewards to stake pool operators (SPOs).

The latest move comes from BitMine Immersion ($BMNR), chaired by Tom Lee of Fundstrat, which has again loaded up on ETH while prices sit under pressure. The company confirmed it acquired 110,288 ETH over the past week, a 34% jump compared to the week before. That brings its total holdings to 3.5 million ETH, or about 2.9% of the total Ethereum supply. At current prices, that’s roughly $12.7 billion in ETH, according to CoinMarketCap, where ETH trades around $3,639. Lee calls it a simple strategy, buy when others hesitate. “The recent dip in ETH prices presented an attractive opportunity,” said Tom Lee. “We increased our ETH purchases this week. We’re now more than halfway toward our initial goal of owning 5% of the ETH supply.” BitMine provided its latest holdings update for Nov 10th, 2025: $13.2 billion in total crypto + ""moonshots"": -3,505,723 ETH at $3,639 per ETH (Bloomberg) – 192 Bitcoin (BTC) – $61 million stake in Eightco Holdings (NASDAQ: ORBS) (“moonshots”) and – unencumbered… — Bitmine (NYSE-BMNR) $ETH (@BitMNR) November 10, 2025 Building Toward “The Alchemy of 5%” BitMine’s target is clear: control 5% of all Ethereum. The company already holds 3,505,723 ETH, with a growing balance sheet and the liquidity to keep buying. This week’s purchase lifts total crypto and investment assets to $13.2 billion, as of November 10, 2025. Breakdown: 3,505,723 ETH at $3,639 each 192 BTC $61 million stake in Eightco Holdings (NASDAQ: ORBS), classified as “moonshots” $398 million in unencumbered cash Even after months of steady accumulation, BitMine still holds nearly $400 million in cash, giving it flexibility to add more ETH without selling other assets. Weekly ETH Buys Show Relentless Accumulation BitMine’s purchase record shows a consistent pattern, steady, disciplined accumulation. Weekly ETH buys (by week ending): Nov 10: 110,288 ETH Nov 3: 82,353 ETH Oct 27: 77,055 ETH Oct 20: 203,826 ETH Oct 13: 202,037 ETH Oct 6: 179,251 ETH Over 850,000 ETH accumulated in just six weeks. Each buy aligns with small market pullbacks, a sign of tactical positioning rather than speculation. At an average cost of $4,020 per ETH, BitMine currently carries about $1.66 billion in unrealized losses. But Lee’s approach is long-term, building exposure during dips, not chasing rallies. “This isn’t about trading,” one Fundstrat analyst noted internally. “It’s about building the largest Ethereum treasury in the world.” Second Largest Crypto Treasury on Earth BitMine now holds the largest Ethereum treasury globally, and the second-largest overall crypto treasury, only behind MicroStrategy ($MSTR), which remains dominant in Bitcoin holdings. The company’s ticker, $BMNR, has become a benchmark for institutional exposure to Ethereum. Trading data backs it up: Average daily dollar volume: $1.6 billion (5-day average as of Nov 7, 2025) Ranking: 48 among all U.S.-listed equities Position: Just behind Lam Research ($LAM) and ahead of Arista Networks ($ANET) Total U.S.-listed stocks: 5,704 Among thousands of listed firms, BitMine sits comfortably inside the top 1% for liquidity. That level of activity places it alongside major tech players, not niche crypto experiments. Tom Lee: “Ethereum Is a Super Cycle Story” Last week, BitMine and the Ethereum Foundation co-hosted an event at the New York Stock Exchange, gathering asset managers, funds, and institutions for a closed-door summit. The theme: tokenization, transparency, and blockchain’s next phase. “Wall Street is very interested in tokenizing assets onto the blockchain,” Lee said. “This creates greater transparency and unlocks new value for issuers and investors.” He calls Ethereum the central player in that shift, the “super cycle story” of the next decade. That phrase, “super cycle,” echoes through crypto circles now. It captures the belief that Ethereum’s value growth won’t rely on hype or speculative mania but on institutional adoption, on-chain utility, and real financial infrastructure being built atop its network. Institutions Aren’t Trading, They’re Owning The tone in Lee’s comments matches a wider sentiment spreading across institutional desks: Ethereum is no longer a trade; it’s infrastructure. Staking rewards, tokenization of traditional assets, and the emergence of regulated ETH-backed funds all push ETH into a new category, a yield-generating, programmable reserve asset. “Big money is buying while prices are down… are you?” BitMine wrote in a recent post on X (formerly Twitter). That line isn’t marketing fluff, it’s a statement of positioning. When ETH dipped under $3,400 earlier this month, BitMine accelerated purchases. The company calls it “building liquidity on chain.” The Treasury Strategy Behind the numbers lies a simple playbook: convert idle corporate cash into productive, staked ETH. By locking ETH in validator nodes, BitMine earns staking rewards while strengthening the network’s security. Each week, more of its holdings move from cold storage into active staking pools, according to the company’s internal metrics. With 3.5 million ETH under control, BitMine’s validators likely account for more than 3% of the total staking network. That gives the company influence, not just financially, but technically, across the Ethereum ecosystem. Cash Reserves and Flexibility BitMine’s $398 million cash position acts as both a safety net and a war chest. The company increased cash from $389 million to $398 million in the same week it added more ETH, signaling strong internal liquidity. That financial structure allows it to absorb volatility without needing to liquidate holdings or hedge exposure. It also means BitMine can keep accumulating even if ETH corrects further. Beyond ETH, Small Steps into “Moonshots” BitMine’s $61 million stake in Eightco Holdings (NASDAQ: ORBS) sits under its “moonshots” portfolio, smaller, high-risk blockchain investments. While ETH remains the core, these secondary bets show a willingness to explore emerging blockchain layers and enterprise adoption. Still, ETH remains the centerpiece. “We’re building an Ethereum-based balance sheet,” Lee said earlier this quarter. “Everything else revolves around it.” BitMine’s rise highlights a shift across the market: crypto treasuries are going institutional. Where MicroStrategy made Bitcoin the corporate treasury story of the 2020s, BitMine is doing the same for Ethereum. Its pattern is clear, consistent buying, disciplined staking, and visible transparency through public filings. As more companies adopt similar models, ETH’s liquid supply continues to shrink, setting the stage for what Lee calls the “alchemy of 5%”, institutional control over a meaningful share of the world’s programmable money. The question isn’t whether institutions are buying. It’s how much more they’ll buy before everyone notices. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

However, a strong 27.68% surge in Chinese-made Tesla exports offset the declining domestic retail sales. The CPCA (China Passenger Car Association) emphasized that slowing demand for the Model Y L may be a contributing factor to the declining retail sales. Tesla also exported more vehicles from its Shanghai factory than it sold locally. The CPCA believes exporting more may also have caused the poor retail sales in the Chinese market. October’s retail sales represented a 35.76% decrease from the 40,485 units sold in October 2024. The October retail sales also represented a 63.64% drop from September’s 71,525 units. Data compiled by CnEVPost also confirms that September was Tesla’s second-best month this year. March’s monthly retail sales reached 74,127 units. The report attributed the EV maker’s surge in monthly sales to the September 2 announcement that Model Y L deliveries had started. CPCA says Tesla’s retail sales in China are falling The CPCA said Tesla’s retail sales in China from January to October fell 8.83% YoY to 485,710 units. Exports from the Shanghai factory also dropped 14.05% over the same period year-over-year (YoY) to 209,151. However, the U.S. EV maker exported 35,491 units from China in October 2025, its highest monthly export sales since November 2023. The surge in export sales represents a 27.69% YoY rise and an increase of 82% from September. Meanwhile, Tesla China’s wholesale sales in October, including domestic and export sales, totaled 61,497 units. The CPCA report shows this was a 9.93% YoY decline and a 32.28% drop from September. Model Y wholesale sales in October were 38,562 vehicles, down 8.76% YoY and 35.63% MoM (month-on-month). The Model 3 wholesale sales in October reached 22,935 units, which was a drop of about 11.84% YoY, and 25.79% MoM. The Model Y wholesale sales between January and October were also down 6.89% YoY to 417,229 vehicles. Model 3 wholesale sales over the same period fell 15.31% YoY to 250,632. Tesla China advances two new projects Local media reports suggest that Tesla is advancing two new vehicles codenamed E41 and D50. The two projects are reportedly stripped-down versions of the current Model 3 and Model Y. Parts of the validation reports and design for both projects reuse existing components from the Model 3 and Model Y. The two projects are allegedly already in the validation testing phase. The U.S. EV maker has also launched the slimmed-down Model 3 and Model Y variants in the North American market on October 7. Tesla simplified and eliminated over 20 features, reducing the starting prices by $5,000 to $5,500. Meanwhile, these stripped-down models could enter production in China by mid-2026 or later. Tesla’s China team reportedly led the development of a lower-cost Model Y with minimal changes to its chassis, battery, and powertrain. The team used the “depop” approach to build the new model. The internal strategy simplifies configurations and enables fast production while preserving Tesla’s core functions. The EV automaker also announced plans to revive development on the NV91 and NV93. The projects are expected to create new models smaller than the Model Y. Tesla CEO Elon Musk previously mentioned that the NV91 would have a starting price of $25,000. The project was scheduled for mass production in August this year, but was stopped early last year.

Although big coins such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have maintained dominance in the news, newer but DeFi-centric assets are beginning to gain momentum in the news regarding their energy and innovation. Mutuum finance (MUTM) is one of the projects that have been in the forefront of this transition; it is a new crypto that most people believe will be one of the major altcoins to breakout in the fourth quarter of 2025. Strong Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance has established the reputation of being one of the top crypto presales active in 2025. In Phase 6, which is already more than 85% sold, the token is already priced at $0.035. The MUTM token, which started its presale at $0.01 at the beginning of 2025, has increased by nearly 300%, which is organic and steady across all stages. Its initial launch price will be formally $0.06. The project already raised more than $18.55 million and received over 17,850 holders. Of this 4 billion MUTM supply, approximately 45.5% (1.82 billion) will be the presale, a construct that is aimed at ensuring that the community can have meaningful ownership instead of a group of early insiders having the tokens concentrated in their hands. Mutuum Finance also has a 24-hour leaderboard, where the best contributor of the day wins an equivalent of $500 in MUTM. It has been used to maintain the high engagement rates, and thus the presale is one of the most vibrant events that are in progress in the DeFi crypto industry. Developing a Dual-Lending Decentralized Finance System Mutuum Finance is building a decentralized lending and borrowing contracting framework that enables easy access to on-chain credit markets. It aims at providing a platform through which their users can loan out their possessions to make passive returns or borrow without the ability to forfeit ownership. One of its major design elements is the use of yield-bearing tokens to depositors, whom it issues when depositors lend out its assets. These tokens will gain value at an automatic rate. Part of the platform revenue will be used to purchase MUTM tokens in the open market which the former are redistributed to users who stake in the safety module in their mtTokens. This generates sustained purchasing interest on the token and incentive on long-term owners. To keep trust and transparency, Trust in Mutuum Finance has had a 90/100 Token Scan score on CertiK audit, which is amongst the highest security scores of new projects this year. It also has a bug bounty program, which proposes the use of ethical hackers to test the code before its mainnet launch, with a potential award of 50,000. This two-layered security system supports the responsible development focus of Mutuum Finance, which is unusual in start-up crypto companies. Stablecoin and Oracle Integration Plans In the future, Mutuum Finance plans to launch a USD-pegged stablecoin of its own, which will become a significant part of the ecosystem of the protocol. The stablecoin will serve as a significant liquidity tool, and interest paid by the borrower will be refunded back to the treasury which will enhance sustainability of the platform in the long term. Moreover, Mutuum Finance plans to incorporate a powerful oracle to make sure that collateralized assets price feeds are right and real time. Such oracles will probably become a compilation of various sources of data including Chainlink and the time-weighted averages of the DEX, which will be reliable in volatile market conditions. Analyst estimates suggest that on this trend and provided that Mutuum Finance achieves its roadmap, the token would appreciate by up to 500-600% of the value it presold at in the long term. The foundation of these projections is on the blend of good presale performance, security infrastructure and the availability of obvious technical milestones to the launch. V1 Launch and Whale Activity The next significant accomplishment of Mutuum Finance will be the new V1 protocol launch . The release is planned as part of Q4 2025 on the Sepolia Testnet and will entail such core elements as liquidity pools and mtTokens as well as debt tokens and a liquidator bot to ensure stability in the system. This achievement will shift Mutuum Finance out of development into live testing, which is a very important phase that frequently leads to increased awareness within DeFi circles. On the back, weighting of whales tracking seems to have large holders already piling up MUTM in Phase 6. Such allocations normally signify the faith in the long-term course of the project and serve as an extra credibility assurance in the bigger market. Phase 6 almost sold out and the demand is continuously increasing with the investors expecting the resultant price growth in Phase 7. The fixed-price and fixed-allocation of the presale guarantees that one stage needs to be sold out before the next comes on, which is naturally constitutive of scarcity and upward steady momentum. Why MUTM Stands Out in 2025 Mutuum Finance is a utility-based DeFi crypto in a saturated market of speculative-driven assets that integrate transparency, functionality, and organized growth. Having robust presale sales, audited security, and explicitly developed product roadmap, it is not just another fad in this new trending token, it is a platform that has the potential to become a permanent feature of the DeFi market. With investors seeking the next best crypto under $0.05, Mutuum Finance provides an allotment of cheapness, technological advancement as well as a finite development. As the inaugural product, its V1 release, and increased involvement of both retail and institutional clients, the project gains plenty of momentum as it enters 2026, making MUTM a possible breakout altcoin of the next market cycle.

The US Senate Agriculture Committee just dropped a bipartisan draft that could transform how digital assets are regulated. This groundbreaking crypto market structure bill represents a major step toward much-needed regulatory clarity for the entire industry. What Does This Crypto Market Structure Bill Actually Do? The CLARITY Act draft creates a clear framework dividing oversight between two key agencies. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will handle securities, while the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) takes commodities. This separation resolves years of jurisdictional confusion that has plagued cryptocurrency development. Why Should You Care About Regulatory Changes? This legislation directly impacts how cryptocurrencies are classified and regulated. Here’s what matters most: Clear exemptions from Securities Act registration for qualifying digital assets Defined roles for SEC and CFTC oversight Legal certainty for businesses and investors Consumer protection through proper regulatory frameworks How Will This Crypto Market Structure Bill Affect Your Investments? For everyday cryptocurrency users and investors, this legislation brings welcome predictability. When regulatory boundaries are clear, businesses can innovate confidently, and investors can make informed decisions. The crypto market structure bill specifically addresses how different digital assets should be treated, potentially opening doors for more institutional participation. What Challenges Remain for Implementation? While promising, this draft is just the beginning. The legislation must navigate through committees, potential amendments, and full Senate approval. Then it faces the House of Representatives before reaching the President’s desk. However, the bipartisan nature of this crypto market structure bill suggests strong support across party lines. Conclusion: A New Era for Cryptocurrency Regulation This crypto market structure bill represents the most significant legislative progress toward comprehensive digital asset regulation we’ve seen. By establishing clear guidelines and agency responsibilities, it paves the way for sustainable growth and innovation in the cryptocurrency space. The entire industry watches with anticipation as this legislation moves forward. Frequently Asked Questions What is the CLARITY Act? The CLARITY Act is proposed legislation that creates a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies by dividing oversight between SEC and CFTC. When will this bill become law? There’s no set timeline. The draft must pass through multiple legislative stages including committee reviews, Senate and House votes, and presidential approval. How does this affect Bitcoin and Ethereum? The bill provides clarity on which agency regulates different digital assets, potentially classifying some major cryptocurrencies as commodities under CFTC oversight. What are the registration exemptions? Cryptocurrencies meeting specific conditions may be exempt from Securities Act of 1933 registration requirements, reducing compliance burdens. Why is this bill bipartisan? Both parties recognize the need for clear cryptocurrency regulation to protect consumers while fostering innovation in this growing industry.

54245369,625153,1762810393,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54245369.jpeg,Crypto Staking Now Approved For US ETFs And Trusts: Key Details,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-staking-now-approved-for-us-etfs-and-trusts/,"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently announced that the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) have provided a clear legal pathway for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and trusts to stake crypto assets and share rewards with investors. New Crypto Staking Provisions Bill Hughes, a market expert and lawyer from the blockchain software firm ConsenSys, explained that, under the new provisions announced by Secretary Bessent, trusts can stake digital assets on permissionless proof-of-stake (PoS) networks if they meet specific criteria. These requirements include holding only one type of crypto asset along with cash, utilizing a qualified custodian to manage keys and execute the staking process, and maintaining Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)-approved liquidity policies. This ensures that redemptions can occur even when assets are staked. Additionally, trusts must establish arms-length arrangements with independent staking providers and restrict their activities solely to holding, staking, and redeeming assets, avoiding any discretionary trading. Hughes believes that the implications for staking adoption are substantial. This offers much-needed regulatory and tax clarity for institutional investment vehicles, including crypto ETFs and trusts. It enables these entities to engage in staking while remaining compliant with existing laws. By effectively removing a significant legal hurdle that has previously deterred fund sponsors, custodians, and asset managers from integrating staking yields into regulated investment products, the new framework opens the door for broader participation. Increased Staking Participation Anticipated As a result of these developments, the expert asserted that more regulated entities will likely begin staking on behalf of investors, which could lead to increased staking participation, enhanced liquidity, and greater network decentralization. Notably, this new framework aligns tax treatment with evolving SEC disclosure requirements and exchange liquidity standards, reinforcing staking as a legitimate and conservative yield-generation strategy within US financial products.

Martinis has formed the Quantum Scaling Alliance with HPE, Applied Materials, Synopsys, and others",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/synopsys-hpe-nobel-winner-quantum-alliance/,"One of this year’s Nobel Prize winners, John M. Martinis, has announced a partnership with Applied Materials, Synopsys, HPE, and others. The major goal of the Quantum Scaling Alliance, formed by John M. Martinis, is to make quantum computers scalable and accessible. Building scalable quantum systems John M. Martinis, one of this year’s Nobel Prize winners in physics, has partnered with major chip and tech firms to make quantum computing accessible for everyday use. On Monday, Martinis announced the creation of the Quantum Scaling Alliance, which is a new group that aims to make quantum supercomputers that can be built at a large scale. The alliance includes Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Applied Materials, and Synopsys, as well as startups 1QBit, Quantum Machines, Riverlane, and the University of Wisconsin. Quantum computers use qubits, which can exist in multiple states at once, unlike classical bits that are only zero or one. This distinct feature allows them to perform calculations far faster for specific types of problems, such as simulating molecules for drug discovery or solving optimization challenges in logistics and finance. However, most quantum computers today are handcrafted in limited numbers. Major tech players like IBM, Microsoft, and Google have made significant progress in mass-producing these computers, but their quantum machines are typically built by small teams, one system at a time. Martinis, who previously worked at Google and now leads the startup Qolab, said the alliance wants to fix that problem by applying the same mass-production methods used in the semiconductor industry. “Since the early work in the field in the 1980s, quantum chips have been made in an artisanal way,” he told Reuters . “At this point, we think it’s time to switch over to a more standard professional model — using very sophisticated tools.” Martinis also emphasizes the importance of scalability. “Quantum technology has reached the point where we need to think about mass production,” he said. “That’s how we’ll move from prototypes to practical systems that can make a real difference.” Integrating quantum chips into traditional computing A major challenge the initiative will have to deal with is the sensitivity of quantum circuits, as they are highly sensitive to interference, and even small errors can disrupt results. Correcting these errors requires powerful classical processors working together with quantum ones. Masoud Mohseni, who leads the quantum team at HPE, has been working with Martinis and over thirty researchers on a technical system for integrating the two systems. That plan will now move forward under the new consortium. “People think, naively, that once you have a system that is hundreds of qubits or that if you make it to thousands, then you can make it to millions. That’s just not true,” Mohseni explained. “At each scale, you face completely new challenges.” The alliance is made up of members who will bring their specialized expertise to address these challenges. Applied Materials, one of the world’s biggest chip equipment makers, will contribute its experience in advanced fabrication. Synopsys, a leader in chip design software, will help create more consistent and larger-scale quantum chips. Meanwhile, HPE’s background in high-performance computing will support the integration of quantum and classical elements in supercomputers. By leveraging existing production tools for the computers, the alliance hopes to reduce costs and accelerate development. No timeline has been set for the first commercial system.

The answer lies not in apocalyptic predictions but in understanding the fundamental mismatch between AI’s lightning-fast software development and the slow, deliberate pace of building the physical infrastructure that powers it. What Really Defines an AI Bubble? Contrary to popular belief, a tech bubble isn’t necessarily a catastrophic event. In economic terms, it’s simply a bet that grew too large, creating more supply than demand. The current AI bubble represents massive investments in infrastructure that may or may not align with future usage patterns. The Infrastructure Challenges Behind AI Growth The core problem facing AI expansion isn’t just technological innovation—it’s physical construction. Data centers take years to build, while AI software evolves in months. This creates several critical challenges: Power requirements outpacing electrical grid capabilities Construction timelines misaligned with technological advancement Geographic limitations for suitable data center locations Cooling systems struggling with next-generation chip demands Massive Investments Meet Demand Uncertainty The scale of current AI investments is staggering. Oracle has committed $300 billion in cloud services to OpenAI, while the “Stargate” project involves $500 billion in total AI infrastructure. Meta plans to spend $600 billion on infrastructure over three years. Yet McKinsey surveys show most companies remain in “wait and see” mode regarding AI adoption. Company Investment Timeline Oracle/OpenAI $300B Ongoing Stargate Project $500B Multi-year Meta $600B 3 years Oracle New Mexico $18B credit Construction The Real Demand Uncertainty Problem While infrastructure spending reaches unprecedented levels, genuine demand for AI services remains unclear. Most businesses use AI for specific cost-cutting applications rather than transformative business changes. The gap between infrastructure supply and actual usage creates significant bubble risks. Power and Space: The Hidden Bottlenecks Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently highlighted that data center space, not chips, represents the primary constraint. Existing facilities sit idle because they can’t handle modern chip power requirements. The electrical grid and construction industry move at traditional paces, creating expensive bottlenecks even if AI demand materializes as expected. Actionable Insights for Navigating the AI Landscape Understanding the AI bubble requires recognizing these key factors: Monitor infrastructure development timelines versus software advancement Evaluate actual business adoption rates beyond hype cycles Consider power and space constraints in investment decisions Watch for breakthroughs in energy efficiency and semiconductor design The AI revolution faces a fundamental tension: digital innovation moves at light speed while physical infrastructure crawls. The companies that navigate this mismatch successfully will define the next decade of technological progress. Frequently Asked Questions What companies are leading AI infrastructure investment? Major players include Oracle , working with OpenAI on the Stargate project, and Meta , which has committed $600 billion to infrastructure. Who has expressed concerns about AI infrastructure? Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has highlighted data center space as a greater concern than chip supply. What research informs demand uncertainty? Recent McKinsey surveys show most companies remain cautious about large-scale AI adoption.

Bitcoin fell 21.46% from its all-time high in October last week, briefly dropping below $100,000 to $99,045, according to the report. However, this move signals a search for a new bottom rather than the start of a widespread liquidation. Bitfinex argues that both historical price data and on-chain indicators suggest that the current move closely mirrors the mid-stage corrections seen in previous cycles. These periods involve structural investors locking in their positions, reallocating capital within the ecosystem, and compressing volatility ahead of major upsides. Bitcoin’s failure to defend its $112,500 short-term investor (STH) cost floor led to a controlled price pullback and a retest of deep support levels. This move appears to be a planned correction, according to the report. At these levels, approximately 72% of Bitcoin's supply is still in the profit zone, which falls below the 70–90% equilibrium band typical of mid-cycle consolidations. This structure suggests that the market has largely cleared out its speculative excess. Bitfinex points to the Active Trader Realized Price of $88,500 as the next major downward reference. In past cycles, this region has been the point where selling pressure shifts to reaccumulation. While short-term upward reactions are expected, a sustained recovery requires renewed strength in institutional and retail demand. Related News: What Will Happen to Bitcoin and Altcoins if the US Government Shutdown Ends? - XRP Spot ETF Hype Begins The report also highlights rising uncertainty on the macro front. While corporate borrowing is recovering, signs of a slowdown on the employment front are growing stronger. While official data is lacking, private sector indicators suggest the US labor market is weakening faster than expected. The ADP National Employment Report for October showed only 42,000 new jobs were created. Nearly all of the new jobs came from large corporations, while small and medium-sized businesses continued to shed employees for the third consecutive month. Consumer confidence fell 6% in November, suggesting that households are beginning to feel the effects of slowing employment and political uncertainty. According to Bitfinex, the crypto industry has entered a new phase of mainstream adoption, driven by fast-growing stablecoin volumes and increasing global regulatory action. In October 2025, the monthly trading volume of Ethereum-based stablecoins reached an all-time high of $2.82 trillion. This represents a 45% increase compared to the previous month. The primary drivers of this surge were investors' shift to dollar-denominated stablecoins as the market retreated, and Ethereum's growing Layer-2 network offered faster and cheaper transactions. Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) has approved a new stablecoin pilot involving three of Japan's largest banks: Mizuho, MUFG, and SMBC. The program, set to launch in November 2025, aims to test digital payment systems regulated under new financial laws. *This is not investment advice.

The return of risk-on sentiment also sent Ripple and Solana higher, climbing 10% and 3% respectively. At the same time, Trump floated the idea of a $2,000 “dividend” for Americans, funded by tariff revenue, an announcement that helped tech stocks push the S&P 500 and Nasdaq even higher. The potential reopening would also allow the release of economic data , which the Federal Reserve needs to decide whether to cut rates again at its next meeting in December. If the labor market shows signs of weakness, rate cuts are back on the table. This is particularly relevant for crypto because looser policy often boosts investor appetite for Bitcoin. On that front, John Williams, who runs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, recently said the Fed might need to expand its balance sheet through bond purchases, another signal that more cash could be injected into the financial system. That possibility was picked up in a report by 10X Research, which stated, “A potential Fed balance-sheet expansion, and especially a December rate cut, would be unequivocally bullish for Bitcoin and could reignite the broader bull market.” But the same note warned that unless the Fed actually follows through, the bounce from the shutdown progress might be short-lived. “Our base case is that this government-reopening bounce provides only temporary support, and that ETF outflows are likely to resume unless the Fed moves to cut or meaningfully expand liquidity,” the authors added. Technical support and derivatives data show mixed picture The rally came after a rough stretch in October when Bitcoin dropped from a record high above $126,000 to just under $100,000, as leveraged trades got wiped out and long-time holders took profits. But Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, a managing director at JPMorgan, said in a recent note that the worst of that pullback is now in the rearview. “The deleveraging episode is largely behind us,” Nikolaos wrote, adding that Bitcoin could rally toward $170,000 over the next 6 to 12 months. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) bounced from under 30, suggesting that heavy selling may have cooled. A slight improvement in cumulative volume delta also shows sellers are getting quieter and buyers are stepping back in. Spot market activity is still running high, hinting that interest remains strong, especially if Bitcoin can push above $111,000 toward $116,000, a resistance zone traders are watching closely. In derivatives, Bitcoin open interest is still slowly dropping, while options markets are still defensive, with many traders holding downside protection, but the shrinking volatility spread hints that fear is fading. On-chain data looks better: transfer volumes are rising, address activity is stable, and transaction fees remain steady, all signs of a functioning network, according to Glassnode. Profitability still looks rough. Short-term holders are deep in the red, with unrealized losses rising. But these conditions often come before accumulation phases, when stronger investors buy up supply from weaker hands. Right now, Bitcoin is hovering in a range between $100K and $108K, and that zone could become a new support base, even as the broader profitability downtrend continues to weigh on sentiment.

Taiwan’s semiconductor industry has become a vital part of the global semiconductor supply chains, strengthening the island’s defense from external threats. Taiwan’s semiconductor defense shield The former Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen has said that Taiwan’s semiconductor industry not only powers the global economy but also strengthens the island’s defense and resilience against external threats. “Our high-tech sector, particularly in semiconductors, has become an indispensable part of the global economy,” Tsai said, speaking at the Berlin Freedom Conference on Monday. “In an age where AI also defines power, Taiwan’s chip industry anchors global prosperity.” She also added that the country is strategically protected by its strong semiconductor ecosystem. “Now, it is such an initiative that helps Taiwan strengthen its defence and societal resilience in the face of threats,” she said . Taiwan produces the majority of the world’s most advanced chips through companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company ( TSMC ). The semiconductor industry’s dominance has made the island an important part of global supply chains and a central figure in geopolitical discussions involving China and the West. As tensions between China and Taiwan remain high, technology has become part of the island’s defense strategy. Taiwan has gained a form of immunity due to the fact that any disruption to its chip production would affect industries worldwide. Analysts often refer to this dynamic as the “silicon shield.” It is the idea that Taiwan’s technological importance makes it too valuable to isolate or attack without global consequences. Taiwan reiterates commitment to its allies During her speech, Tsai emphasized Taiwan’s commitment to working closely with international partners. She said the island values the support of its security and economic allies. “We are also willing to bear our share of the burden and do not take our security partners’ support for granted,” she said. Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, maintains only one formal diplomatic relationship in Europe, and it’s with the Vatican. However, many European countries, including Britain, France, Lithuania, and Poland, have strengthened their informal ties with Taipei despite Beijing’s objections. These countries have hosted or met with senior Taiwanese officials, signaling a growing interest in cooperation on trade, technology, and democratic governance. This interest is due to the current European effort to diversify technology supply chains and reduce dependency on China. The United States, the European Union, and Japan have all attempted to strengthen their ties with Taiwan’s chip sector, investing heavily in domestic manufacturing while maintaining collaboration with TSMC and other Taiwanese firms.

The same process preceded the debut of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs earlier this year. Market participants now expect the first XRP ETFs to go live by mid or late November, given the SEC’s newly streamlined listing rules that bypass lengthy procedural delays. Canary Capital’s CEO Steven McClurg hinted on X that their XRPC ETF could launch “next week,” echoing the firm’s rapid rollout of Litecoin and Hedera ETFs. Meanwhile, Franklin Templeton and 21Shares have filed final amendments with the SEC, triggering the 20-day countdown that could see trading begin imminently. XRP's price records some profits on the daily chart. Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview XRP Price Holds Key Range as Analysts Predict $10 Surge Amid the ETF momentum, XRP trades at around $2.47, up 8% in the past 24 hours. Despite a 25% correction from October highs of $3.09, analysts see current levels as a setup phase before a potential breakout. Ali Martinez and Cryptollica, two prominent market analysts, both forecast a rally toward $10, citing bullish technical structures and ETF-driven inflows as catalysts. Martinez identified a rectangle range between $1.90 and $3.38, arguing that a final retest near $1.90 could precede an explosive upward leg. On the other hand, Cryptollica’s four-phase market model places XRP in its final “Phase 4” advance, the stage historically associated with parabolic rallies. Technical charts also show tightening Bollinger Bands, an RSI near 47, and a possible MACD bullish crossover, hinting that momentum may be shifting in favor of buyers. Institutional Flows Could Redefine XRP’s Market Dynamics The arrival of spot XRP ETFs would mark a watershed moment in digital asset finance, integrating one of the most liquid blockchain assets into regulated investment channels. Analysts estimate that early inflows could exceed $1 billion in the first few months, mirroring the pattern seen with Solana and Ethereum ETFs. As the U.S. government reopens and dollar liquidity expands, XRP’s regulated status and ETF exposure could attract large treasury buyers and fund managers.

In the weeks since, the token’s gradual pullback confirmed that forecast, touching the 55-week average at the start of November. The analyst has since resurfaced with a follow-up post captioned simply “$XRP: GET READY ,” meaning that the consolidation phase may now be giving way to the breakout stage. This level has been a reliable reference point for the altcoin’s cyclical momentum, and it has always acted as a foundation for sustained breakouts. The structure on the weekly chart has followed this in a similar bullish setup in November 2024, and the recent defense of this support area suggests renewed strength among medium- and long-term holders. Analysts like ChartNerd see the retest as the final step before a broader move toward price discovery. What To Expect As November Progresses From a structural standpoint, XRP’s chart is still maintaining its long-term bullish pattern, thanks to higher lows preserved across the weekly timeframe. The fact that the token has managed to hold above $2.20 strengthens the support around this level. The remainder of November could be decisive for whether XRP transitions from correction to expansion. A sustained bounce above the 55 WEMA would confirm the beginning of the next upward leg envisioned in ChartNerd’s analysis. Such confirmation could attract new inflows, especially from traders tracking the indicator’s reliability. In another technical analysis, CharNerd revealed that the $2.70 price level is the immediate resistance to break in order for the altcoin to start pushing back to ATHs. From there, the next technical target is around $3.00, with a continuation to $3.60 and $4.00 once the entire crypto market sentiment becomes bullish again. However, the bullish outlook is contingent on holding above the 55 WEMA. Failure to do so will turn it into resistance, and the bullish setup would need to be reassessed. In that scenario, the token might re-enter a broader consolidation range through December before any attempt to break higher. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.48, up by 8.1% in the past 24 hours.",XRP|CharNerd|Exponential Moving Average|ripple|WEMA|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-10 22:00:32

Since the filing, the Dogecoin price is up over 12%. Broader FUD tied to the U.S.-China trade war, U.S. government shutdown, and fears of slowing economic growth appears to have taken the back seat as smart money reenters the market. Whales accumulated over 200 million DOGE tokens during Sunday trading, an apparent move to position ahead of ETFs over de-risking. Once approved, spot DOGE ETFs stand to open the floodgates to fresh TradFi demand and institutional-level exposure. Dogecoin Price Prediction: Could Approval Flip the Scales? The refocus on the ETF narrative comes as DOGE sets its sights on the breakout of a year-long ascending channel setup. With its lower boundary now affirmed as a launchpad, a breakout attempt is in play, supported by increasingly bullish momentum indicators. DOGE / USD 1-day chart, ascending channel eyes breakout.

The RSI has made a sharp rise back towards neutral, a sign of significant buy pressure, while the MACD histograms growing lead above the signal line puts the prevailing trend firmly in the hands of the bulls. An advance to reclaim the $0.20 demand zone as psychological support could confirm a renewed breakout push, targeting previous highs at $0.50 for a 200% gain . A fresh touchpoint for capital inflows, like ETFs, could push this even further, putting the coveted $1 milestone in focus for a potential 450% gain. However, a breakdown scenario remains a possibility with limited support below $0.15, risking a potential 50% crash back to pre-bull run levels at $0.09. Maxi Doge: Dogecoin Hype Could Offer a Bigger Breakout Play If past cycles prove anything, it’s that Doge-branded tokens carry the strongest social momentum. Shiba Inu carried the torch from Dogecoin in 2021, then Floki, Bonk, Dogwifhat, Neiro, and most recently Dowge. Every bull run eventually delivers its own parabolic Doge-themed runner. This time around, imminent spot ETFs and the DOGE-1 lunar mission create the perfect environment for a new frontrunner, and speculators are eyeing Maxi Doge ($MAXI) as the next moonshot. The hype is already translating into numbers. The $MAXI presale has brought in almost $4 million, with early backers currently enjoying a high 78% APY on staking rewards. For those who missed out on the Doge wave before, MaxiDoge could be the next opportunity to catch a meme coin breakout before it runs.

The statements increased expectations that an interest rate cut of 25 to 50 basis points would be on the agenda, especially in December. Miran began by stating that all data received since September pointed to a rate cut. He then clarified his message by saying, “Easing monetary policy is now essential.” In his assessment of the labor market, Miran stated that the unemployment rate is rising, employment is softening, and that “full employment levels have not yet been reached.” Miran, stating that core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation is moving toward the 2% target, argued that some of his colleagues were overlooking “lagged inflation effects.” Still, he noted that the latest data was “stable and on a downward trend,” suggesting that a more dovish stance compared to September was reasonable. “A 50 basis point cut would be appropriate, at least 25 basis points,” he said of the December meeting.
