54450286,628532,1763238612,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54450286.jpeg,Matthew Sigel Triggers Uproar In XRP Community – Here’s What He Said,https://bitcoinist.com/matthew-sigel-triggers-uproar-in-xrp-community-heres-what-he-said/,"Matthew Sigel, the head of digital assets research at VanEck , has ignited a storm within the XRP community with a single sarcastic remark on X social media. While brief, his statement seemed to dismiss years of development and innovation behind the XRP Ledger (XRPL) , leaving many community members and industry analysts both shocked and aggrieved. Sigel’s words have sparked passionate debates about the value, utility, and understanding of XRP as a blockchain and digital asset. Sigel Draws Criticism For Subtly Mocking XRP Sigel’s controversial post appeared to be a subtle jab toward XRP enthusiasts, suggesting that he would never understand the XRPL blockchain but respected the passion and effort required to “pretend it does something.” Sigel’s mocking tone appeared to diminish the accomplishments of XRP over the years, provoking instant backlash from the cryptocurrency’s dedicated community. The VanEck executive implied that, despite the visible enthusiasm and hustle of supporters, the work behind XRP might ultimately be meaningless. His veiled critique about the blockchain and the community backing it struck a nerve, likely because XRP has been under development for over a decade, with consistent progress in regulatory navigation , DeFi applications, and cross-border payment solutions. Members of the XRP community who felt the post belittled the financial and technological innovations embedded in the blockchain’s ecosystem have voiced strong opinions that sharply contrast with Sigel’s statement. Some have even criticized the VanEck executive for his perceived lack of understanding and appreciation of the technology, particularly given his current role as head of digital asset research at the asset management company. XRP Community Pushes Back Against Sigel’s Statement In response to Sigel’s post on X, many prominent figures in the crypto space immediately challenged his mocking remarks. Panos Mekras, co-founder of Anodos Finance, highlighted the groundbreaking nature of the XRP Ledger, noting its ability to naturally deepen liquidity and act as a decentralized settlement layer without the risks associated with smart contracts or wallet exploits. Digital asset researcher Anders also criticized Sigel for publicly admitting a lack of understanding. At the same time, Ripple developer Matt Hamilton emphasized the professional responsibility of those in digital asset research to grasp the fundamentals of blockchain. Popular market analyst CryptoSensei mocked the irony of VanEck’s research lead dismissing XRP’s technological innovations, suggesting the asset management company might need to hire new blockchain experts. Community members joined the chorus, highlighting that XRP , like Bitcoin, serves as a cornerstone of value and liquidity, and that the collective effort of investors, developers, and enthusiasts lends it unique utility. Other members appeared to be educating Sigel on XRP’s longstanding role in global payments and settlement, stressing that minimal transaction volume does not equate to lack of value, drawing parallels to BTC’s historical pattern. Despite Sigel acknowledging that he would never make sense of the XRP blockchain, supporters remain resolute, using the controversy to enlighten and amplify the network’s achievements and ongoing developments.

Their latest video outlines what they view as a rapidly changing environment for digital assets, with particular attention on regulatory developments, institutional inflows, macroeconomic factors, and shifting financial conditions in the United States. The update focuses heavily on what they believe could influence XRP’s trajectory in the near term. Ripple #XRP HOLY SH*T HE KNOWS THE XRP PRICE SURGE DATE?!?!? (PREPARE NOW!) pic.twitter.com/IDwb3WHMt5 — BULLRUNNERS (@BullrunnersHQ) November 13, 2025 XRP ETF Expectations and Price Projections BullRunners opened their breakdown by stating that the SEC has approved the Canary Capital Spot XRP ETF, which, according to recent updates, has begun trading. They added that Jake Claver expects XRP to reach three- or four-digit price levels if multiple ETFs debut together. According to BullRunners, nine XRP ETFs may go live within a seven- to ten-day window, a scenario they argue could create substantial market movement. They referenced JP Morgan’s estimate of approximately $8 billion in first-year inflows into these funds, suggesting that the circulating supply of XRP on exchanges may be insufficient to absorb that level of demand. In their view, this raises the possibility of an eventual supply squeeze and reduced availability on trading platforms. Broader Crypto Commentary and Regulatory Notes Beyond ETF speculation, BullRunners shifted to lighter commentary on crypto ownership, referencing a CNBC study they claim links cryptocurrency holdings to improved desirability in dating environments. They then moved toward risk-management discussions, promising additional strategies later in the video. The video also touched on U.S. tax guidance, stating that the IRS treats cryptocurrency as real property and emphasizing documentation requirements for those exceeding $19,000 per person in 2025. BullRunners promoted tax-education resources through Altcoin Pro University, positioning them as useful for investors seeking clarity. Macroeconomic Outlook and Liquidity Discussions BullRunners expanded their focus to monetary policy and economic pressures. They said 7 of 12 Federal Reserve members support a 50-basis-point rate cut for December, referencing Deutsche Bank’s expectation that quantitative easing could return in early 2026. They described these factors as components of a potential liquidity wave, though they noted that retail participation remains limited for now.

They pointed to the last stimulus cycle as a period that coincided with strong market activity. Housing Affordability and Employment Concerns The commentary moved into housing challenges, citing the growing consideration of 50-year mortgages for younger generations despite significantly higher lifetime interest costs. BullRunners presented an example comparing past and present home affordability in Utah and argued that many buyers face limited options due to location constraints. They closed with concerns about rising unemployment expectations and an increase in Google searches for second jobs. BullRunners suggested that some individuals may view day trading as an alternative source of income. They ended the segment by posing this possibility to their audience.

The meme coin space in 2025 embodies that same electric blend of chaos and creativity, where humor fuels innovation and risk meets reward. Investors aren’t merely chasing hype anymore; they’re embracing digital culture as a legitimate financial frontier. Each meme coin now represents a movement, merging storytelling with speculation. Within this vibrant digital carnival, fortunes rise, communities grow, and entertainment becomes an undeniable gateway to modern-day investing success. Dogecoin remains the heartbeat of the meme coin revolution, symbolizing simplicity, trust, and accessibility within a decentralized framework. It continues to serve as the people’s crypto, standing as the first meme token to achieve mainstream credibility. Meanwhile, Mog Coin captivates Gen-Z through viral humor, social momentum, and digital creativity, keeping cultural engagement at its core. Yet BullZilla ($BZIL) towers above as the structured disruptor, combining innovation, emotion, and strategy to convert excitement into measurable opportunity.

Here Are the Critical Levels That Must Be Protected and Overcome,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/whats-the-latest-outlook-for-xrp-here-are-the-critical-levels-that-must-be-protected-and-overcome/,"Cryptocurrency analysis firm MakroVision reported in its latest chart assessment for XRP that the asset's technical outlook remains weak. Analysts argued that despite the recent recovery, the price could not stay above critical levels and selling pressure continued. XRP's failure to sustain a breakout above $2.48 is among the key factors driving short-term weakness in the market, according to MakroVision. Despite recent attempts to rally, the price has been rejected from this resistance once again. The company noted that XRP has tested the $2.16 area (the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level) several times in recent days, but there has been no strong buyer response from this area. If this support level is broken, analysts predict the price could quickly retreat to the $2.02-$1.88 range. This area is considered critical because it contains both horizontal support and key Fibonacci levels. Related News: American Billionaire Scaramucci and Trump Form Bitcoin Alliance - Announce Major Investment The assessment stated that for XRP to regain strength, it must first break above the $2.48 level. If this level is broken, the price could find room to reach the $2.65 region, where liquidity is high. MakroVision shared the following conclusion regarding the current technical picture: XRP remains technically weak. Unless the $248 level is retaken, the risk of a new correction towards the $2.00-$1.87 range outweighs the risk. A downside break below these support areas could significantly weaken the medium-term trend. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: What’s the Latest Outlook for XRP?

Despite a recent price dip, a bearish-sounding Death Cross has just triggered precisely at a major structural support, the lower boundary of a long-term pattern. This bullish confluence, where historical market bottoms align with key technical support, suggests that the correction is complete and a significant upward bounce is imminent in the short term. $100,460 Range Low Now Flipped Into Key Resistance BTC has officially lost the range low and slipped to the $96,000 area, according to Lennaert Snyder, who outlined a clear game plan for the days ahead. He noted that the former range low of $100,460 has now flipped into a key resistance level, shaping the next phase of market behavior. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rejection Was No Accident — Now The Battle Shifts To $93,000–$97,000 Survival Zone Snyder explained that if Bitcoin retests the $100,460 mark, the reaction will determine the next move. A rejection at that level would favor short setups, while a successful reclaim would open the door for bullish opportunities. Should BTC reclaim the range low, Snyder expects bullish momentum to kick in, with the first target sitting near the $103,460 resistance area. A push into that zone would signal that buyers are regaining meaningful control over the market. Despite the recent drop, Snyder emphasized that there’s still plenty of liquidity and support below current prices while watching for deeper tests that could provide long entries once reversal signals begin to form. Overall, the market remains technically clean, and price action continues to respect every level with precision. Death Cross Triggers At Megaphone Support — Timing Could Be Perfect For Bitcoin According to a recent post by Colin Talks Crypto, Bitcoin has just flashed a major signal, the Death Cross, which has historically aligned with market bottoms rather than tops despite its ominous name. What makes this even more compelling is its perfect timing: the setup triggered at the exact moment BTC touched the lower boundary of its expanding megaphone pattern. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crashes To $98,000 As HODLer Selling Accelerates The expert noted that this scenario was projected weeks in advance, with mid-November marked as the window to watch. Right on schedule, Bitcoin has landed precisely where the analysis suggested it would. Colin explained that death crosses often act as bottom markers at the tail end of downtrends. Pairing that with BTC hitting a major structural support gives the setup even stronger bullish undertones. It’s not just a technical coincidence – it’s a confluence backed by pattern behavior. With these elements lining up, he believes the probability of an upward reaction from here is high. The chart structure now favors a short-term bounce, suggesting that Bitcoin could soon shift away from weakness and begin carving out a recovery move.

Co-authored by Ethereum Foundation (EF) researchers Yoav Weiss and Marissa, the initiative is based on the principle that Ethereum was not created to make finance efficient, but was made so people could coordinate without trust in intermediaries. Hidden Centralization Risks The team argues that a protocol begins to compromise its core identity the moment a centralized part, like a hosted node or a controlled relayer, is used. They explained that while these decisions may appear insignificant at first, they gradually form a pattern that undermines permissionless access, which sacrifices efficiency and a refined user interface. “The manifesto is a statement of those values: credible neutrality, self-custody, verifiability, and resistance to ‘convenient’ centralization,” wrote the team via X. The document defines a system as truly trustless only when any honest user can join, verify, and take part freely without needing permission or fearing interference. This depends on every action being fully verifiable through public data and on ensuring that no single operator becomes essential to the system’s function. The EF also warns that simplicity built on reliance is not a sign of progress but a loss of independence. “When complexity tempts us to centralize, we must remember: every line of convenience code can become a choke point,” the authors wrote. The manifesto points to the growing use of centralized infrastructure, such as major cloud providers hosting blockchain nodes, as proof of this slow drift toward dependence. The recent Amazon Web Services outage highlighted the risk. Coinbase’s Base chain saw its transaction capacity drop by about 25% when its AWS-hosted sequencer went offline, while Arbitrum and Optimism continued running smoothly because they use multiple cloud providers. Blockchains Urged to Prioritize Trustlessness Over Transaction Volume This message comes at a time when some Layer 2 networks have faced criticism for chasing fast scalability at the expense of full decentralization. Optimism, Arbitrum, and Base have gotten scrutiny for risks like single sequencer control and delayed decentralization plans due to limited community participation in governance. The authors propose a new way to assess the long-term health of a blockchain project by how much it reduces reliance on trust with every transaction, instead of by how many transactions it processes. Developers who want to take the pledge must connect their wallet, read the manifesto, click “Sign the Trustless Manifesto Pledge,” and confirm the transaction. The initiative has already gained support from several figures in the Ethereum community, including EF member Tom Teman and pseudonymous crypto researcher hitas.base.eth.

Dogecoin (DOGE) is still proving to be a resilient performer, with strong community backing and crucial levels well above $0.20, while a number are holding strong around their support level, including Ripple (XRP), which is now looking to rebound towards $3.00. Among the established cryptocurrencies, a fresh face has managed to make a rapid appearance, that being Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Being solely in Presale Stage 6, MUTM has already managed to sell out 90% of this presale round, all at a low price of just $0.035, now sitting well over the initial target set, reaching a strong total so far of over $18.8 million at this early stage of presale, all well before its market entry as a fully fledged cryptocurrency. Investors are labeling MUTM as one of the best cryptos to buy for its early-stage growth and utility. Dogecoin (DOGE) Exhibits Signs of Fresh Bullish Trends Dogecoin (DOGE) has transitioned from a strong downtrend to a strong upward move, indicating a potential takeover by the bulls. Currently, Dogecoin price is sustaining around an important resistance level, fighting to make a comeback, and a successful breakout may bring even better gains. On the other hand, a failed breakout could bring a small dip before moving towards the next leg. Although Dogecoin is performing well as a trading asset, investors are now focusing their attention on Mutuum Finance (MUTM). MUTM presale is gaining traction due to its novel DeFi solution, as the current presale stage is almost fully sold out, making it a must-watch in the top cryptocurrencies list for 2025. XRP Awaits ETF Approval The anticipation around the upcoming Canary Capital XRP ETF, slated to list this Thursday, may bring substantial institutional investment to Ripple. Currently, XRP is seen trading around $2.43, down by a marginal 3%, but holding a vital support level around $2.20. The bulls will now have to breach the resistance level between $2.63 and $2.72 to get a fresh swing high, failing which may toe the price lower to around $2. Even as traders are keeping a keen eye on the arrival of the first-ever ETF by XRP, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining substantial attention among investors due to its revolutionary DeFi initiative and presale activities, establishing itself as one of the best cryptos to buy in the market today. Mutuum Finance Enthralls DeFi Investors Mutuum Finance is rapidly emerging as the top cryptocurrencies investment for early adopters wanting to be part of this revolutionary initiative. The current presale is a fantastic opportunity to purchase MUTM tokens before they are listed on exchanges. The presale is now at phase 6, with tokens sold at a price of $0.035, which is well over three times the price charged at presale phase 1. It should be noted that the presale has managed to accumulate well over $18.8 million, all from 17,980 participants, with phase 6 well past 90% completion. It could be concluded that MUTM is the best cryptos to buy for 2025, as well as a leading DeFi project to watch due to its innovative dual lending model, among other virtues. Creating a Balanced and Comprehensive Ecosystem The presale of Mutuum Finance has been conceptualized to ensure a high degree of transparency, fairness, and sustainability. Out of a total 4 billion MUTM tokens, around 1.82 billion, or 45.5%, have been allocated for the presale period. The response so far has seen over 795 million tokens sold, representing strong interest among both retail and institutional buyers. Mutuum Finance has so far accumulated over 18.8 million, with over 795 million MUTM tokens bought by approximately 18,000 investors. The presale is in phase 6, which is over 90% complete, providing a final opportunity to purchase MUTM tokens at a price of $0.035, as this will rise to $0.04 in presale phase 7. Mutuum Finance’s dual lending, rewarding, and increasingly populous community are making MUTM the top cryptocurrencies pick for investors to keep an eye on in 2025. Lock in your investment opportunity today before entering the big market, and ensure your early position in one of the most promising new crypto coin launches of the year.

54453276,628549,1763244036,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54453276.jpeg,Bitcoin New Role: Here’s How BTC Is Increasingly Intertwined With The Business Cycle,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-and-the-business-cycle/,"Bitcoin is stepping into a new era where its movements can no longer be explained by crypto-native events. Instead, BTC has become increasingly intertwined with the global business cycle, reacting to shifts in institutional positioning. As the market matures, BTC behaves less like a speculative outlier and more like a macro-sensitive asset that rises and falls with the broader economic pulse. Liquidity Cycles Drive Bitcoin More Than Crypto Narratives The correlation between the business cycle and Bitcoin has never been clearer, and the latest chart has made the connection harder to ignore. According to a well-known crypto news analysis on X, CryptosRus, this chart overlays BTC price action with the broader macro business cycle, and the alignment is almost striking. Currently, BTC appears to be approaching a cycle bottom that mirrors previous macro business-cycle lows. What makes this setup compelling is the record-long pre-parabolic phase in BTC history. If this pattern continues, the next major expansion phase may be closer than expected. The market is entering a meaningful turning point. The Co-founders of Glassnode, Swissblock, and censeAG, Negentropic, stated that the Treasury General Account (TGA) drain began on November 14th, and historically, its liquidity flow leads Bitcoin by roughly one week. During the 2019 government shutdown, BTC found its bottom and began recovering within 12 days as liquidity started normalizing. This recent stretch has been the most challenging phase of the liquidity squeeze , and its peak effect has hit this week. The government’s reopening of an estimated $150 billion in excess TGA liquidity is providing a meaningful tailwind as it enters the markets. With the economic data on pause during the government shutdown, the near-term repricing has been influenced by uncertainty. Meanwhile, the Nvidia earnings next week will offer the next clear signal for risk . “The worst of the squeeze is likely behind us, and the setup is improving. Patience is key,” Negentropic noted. Government Liquidity Injection Could Neutralize Recession Fears Brian Rose, the founder and host of LondonRealTV, has also offered an insight into the current market setup, stating that the Federal Reserve has officially announced the end of quantitative tightening (QT). At the same time, the US government is reopening and unleashing more than $100 billion of pent-up liquidity directly back into the system. According to Brian, BTC sentiment is the worst he has seen in years. In the short term, there’s fear around recessionary jobs data, while in the mid-term, there are real catalysts for liquidity. However, as long as nothing is breaking, the market can handle bad data. This is a strange mix of despair and fresh money. Historically, the extreme pessimism combined with liquidity injections has been the exact setup where rallies begin.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Brian Rose|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|CenseAG|CryptosRus|Fed|Federal Reserve|Glassnode|LondonRealTV|Negentropic|Nvidia|QT|Quantitative Tightening|Swissblock|TGA|Treasury General Account,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-15 22:00:36

Major assets slipped sharply, altcoins bled double digits and sentiment across the industry shifted almost overnight. For newcomers, it looked like chaos. For veterans, it was just another day in the world of digital assets. But this time something different is happening. As markets shake, users are moving toward platforms considered more stable, transparent and regulated. And one name keeps circulating more than expected: RentStac . Why the Crash Caught So Many Off Guard Crypto downturns are nothing new, yet the latest drop hit harder than many anticipated. Many investors realized they were relying too heavily on assets that swing wildly in price. Overnight, social media was full of panicked posts, frustrated traders and people questioning whether crypto was still worth it. But while some chased losses, others started looking for safer, more predictable opportunities. And that shift opened the door for alternatives that don’t depend on daily price swings. The New Trend: Investors Are Choosing Stability Over Hype During every major market correction, there are two types of investors. Those who panic and exit. And those who use the downturn to rethink their strategy. The second group is growing fast. Instead of relying purely on speculation, many retail investors are now gravitating toward platforms that offer structured, traceable and reliable digital income streams. This is exactly why RentStac has become a topic of conversation: it doesn’t behave like a typical crypto project and isn’t tied to unpredictable market cycles. RentStac’s Legitimacy Is Becoming a Key Talking Point One of the biggest surprises during the crash was how frequently RentStac appeared in discussions about safer alternatives. Users pointed to its transparency, clear operational model and compliance-driven approach as reasons it stands out from countless speculative platforms. Unlike projects that rely on hype or price pumps, RentStac presents itself as a legitimate digital income solution backed by verifiable operations. The platform has been praised for avoiding the typical “too good to be true” promises that destroyed many crypto projects during previous downturns. And in a climate where trust is everything, that difference matters. Why Investors See RentStac as a “Crash-Proof” Model No platform is completely risk-free. But RentStac benefits from something the crypto market often lacks: predictable returns that don’t depend on sudden price movements. When Bitcoin drops 15 percent in a weekend, platforms like RentStac don’t collapse. They continue functioning as usual because their model isn’t built on speculation. This is one of the main reasons retail investors are calling it “one of the few legit options left” during market volatility. In short, RentStac doesn’t try to replace crypto. It complements it with a model grounded in real operations rather than hype. Crypto May Crash, but Investor Behavior Is Evolving Every market downturn teaches the same lesson. Hype is temporary. Legitimacy survives. This crash didn’t just expose weaknesses in overleveraged coins. It highlighted a shift in investor psychology. People are tired of unstable promises.

After slipping beneath the psychological $100,000 support, worries have surfaced among Bitcoin market participants regarding the broader market structure. Interestingly, the latest on-chain evaluation justifies this worry, as the downside bias for the Bitcoin price seems to be on the rise. Binance Taker Imbalance Falls Into Negative Territory In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, on-chain research firm Arab Chain revealed an increase in sell-side momentum for Bitcoin on Binance, the world’s largest exchange by trading volume. This revelation revolves around the BTC Taker Imbalance % metric, which tracks whether the market is dominated by aggressive buyers or sellers. Narrowing it down, this metric offers insights into taker activity on Binance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Moves Beyond Retail — Institutional Ownership Now Defines The Market Because the metric works by revealing the percentage difference between taker buy volume and taker sell volume, readings with positive values suggest the dominance of buyers in the market. On the contrary, negative readings reveal a seller-dominated market. As Arab Chain reported, there has been an evident spike in the amount of selling pressure in recent hours. A Taker Imbalance % reading of -0.17%, which typically reflects continued bearish action, supports this observation. Moreover, the research firm pointed out that there has been an evident difference between the selling and buying volumes recently. The Quicktake post revealed a record of $1.517 billion in selling volume against $1.058 billion dedicated to buying power, making it clear what party is currently winning this Bitcoin price tussle. Is $92,000 The Next Bitcoin Price Target? What’s interesting is, the current seller-dominated market has caused the BTC price to continuously hover around the key $94,000 level. Arab Chain noted that each attempt by the Bitcoin price to rise has faced an even greater amount of sell resistance, dousing any serious bullish momentum. The grey bars in the above chart suggest that this increasing bearish pressure might not just be a market correction; instead, it reflects a recurrent injection of sell-pressure, one which Arab Chain implied would eventually defeat the weaker buy-side liquidity at the current support. In the likely scenario where more bearish momentum is injected to push the market to the downside, the next level, which could act as a cushion for price, lies around $92,000. If a significant amount of liquidity is not introduced to neutralize the dominance of Bitcoin’s sellers, the Bitcoin price could see an even deeper bearish correction. At press time, Bitcoin is valued at $96,241, reflecting a nearly 2% loss in the past day.

Among the featured assets is XRP, which the firm describes as having real-world utility made tangible, underscoring its importance within the ETF’s structure and the broader digital asset market. The installations accompany the growing attention surrounding the GDLC fund, which went live in September 2025 and offers regulated exposure to several major cryptocurrencies. XRP’s presence in the campaign reflects its position as one of the fund’s key holdings. Presentation of the GDLC Components Grayscale announced the initiative through an update on X, noting that it was bringing the digital assets represented in GDLC into public spaces. Large-format displays have been placed at various locations around New York City, each corresponding to one of the five assets included in the ETF. We brought Grayscale CoinDesk Crypto 5 ETF $GDLC to the real world pic.twitter.com/Uo0JYDqq0x — Grayscale (@Grayscale) November 7, 2025 The installations emphasize the distinct roles of the assets within the cryptocurrency landscape. The messaging attached to each display communicates how Grayscale views the function or contribution of the respective digital asset. XRP’s display highlights its utility-focused reputation and the practical use cases associated with the asset. By presenting these installations publicly, Grayscale aims to increase visibility for the fund and expand awareness of the digital assets it tracks. XRP’s Allocation Within the GDLC Fund The new promotional effort coincides with GDLC’s entrance into the market on September 19, 2025. The ETF is positioned as the first U.S.-listed investment product that gives exposure to several leading digital assets within one regulated structure. The fund’s composition is determined by market capitalization weighting and is rebalanced periodically. As of the latest available update, the GDLC fund is structured with Bitcoin holding the largest share at 75.53%, followed by Ethereum at 15.20%. XRP accounts for 5.45% of the portfolio, while Solana represents 3.08% and Cardano holds the remaining 0.74%. XRP’s share of more than five percent demonstrates the token’s relevance within institutional portfolios that emphasize diversified exposure. Its inclusion at this level suggests that Grayscale considers it an established component of the large-cap digital asset sector. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Structure of the ETF and Current Market Metrics GDLC tracks the collective value of the underlying cryptocurrencies using net asset value (NAV) methodology. Investors gain access to the assets through the ETF without having to manage private keys or directly custody digital tokens. Asset custody for the fund is handled by Coinbase Custody Trust Company. As of November 14, 2025, the fund reports the following data: Non-GAAP assets under management: $579,304,467 NAV per share: $44.88 Market price: $44.85 Shares traded daily: 980,645 One-day NAV change: –$1.52 (–3.28%) One-day market price change: –$1.45 (–3.13%) Premium or discount: –0.07% Although the fund has experienced short-term price movement in line with broader market conditions, the close alignment between NAV and market price indicates stable trading performance for a multi-asset crypto ETF. Implications for XRP and Broader Market Positioning Grayscale’s decision to highlight XRP alongside Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano in a major public campaign indicates the firm’s recognition of XRP’s place within the digital asset ecosystem. The emphasis on “real-world utility” aligns with narratives that present XRP as a token associated with practical financial applications and institutional use. The installations also arrive at a time when Grayscale is preparing additional XRP-related investment products. The company is currently advancing plans for a dedicated XRP spot ETF, with expectations that the product could proceed now that federal government operations have resumed. For XRP investors, the current campaign reinforces the asset’s increasing visibility within regulated financial products and its growing presence in institutional investment discussions.

The effort builds on work led by Commissioner Hester Peirce and the Crypto Task Force, which focuses on transparent and economically fair treatment of cryptocurrencies. SEC Clarifies Which Tokens Are Not Securities In a recent address, Atkins talked about the uncertainty surrounding crypto classification over the past decade, explaining that most of it comes from the changing nature of digital assets. According to him, a cryptocurrency being part of an investment contract under the Howey test does not make it permanently a security because such agreements can end. “I believe that most crypto tokens trading today are not themselves securities,” he said. The new framework is based on a proposed token taxonomy that categorizes cryptocurrencies by function and the purchaser’s expectations. Under this approach, digital commodities, or network tokens, are not classified as securities. Similarly, digital collectibles, such as NFTs, are also excluded from this category because buyers do not anticipate profits from the managerial efforts of others. Digital tools, which serve practical purposes like memberships, tickets, credentials, or identity verification, are also outside SEC oversight. On the other hand, tokenized securities continue to be regulated as securities. Atkins further discussed the application of the Howey test, which identifies investment contracts as involving the putting of money in a common enterprise with an expectation of getting profits from the efforts of others. He said that once the issuer fulfills, fails to satisfy, or terminates their managerial promises, the tokens may continue to trade without being considered securities. The initiative also includes plans for exemptions and a special offering for digital assets tied to investment contracts. The SEC will coordinate with Congress, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), banking regulators, and other stakeholders to create a regulatory environment that supports innovation while maintaining investor protections. Fraud remains subject to enforcement, and anti-fraud provisions will also apply to tokens no longer classified as securities. Shift for Digital Assets Project Crypto, first launched in July 2025, aims to provide clarity, fairness, and integrity for developers, investors, and intermediaries. Headed by Atkins and Peirce, the initiative was started to differentiate between securities and other digital assets. This week is proving pivotal for those looking for clearer rules around crypto. On November 10, the Senate Agriculture Committee shared a draft plan to regulate digital asset commodities. That same day, the U.S. Treasury and IRS issued guidance allowing staking on crypto ETPs and passing staking rewards on to retail investors.

American Bitcoin is a mining company backed by the Trump family, and it has big ambitions for the crypto industry, specifically focusing its business on Bitcoin. Fortune reported that the $220 million round was led by Solari Capital. Other backers in the round include Tony Robbins, Charles Hoskinson the co-founder of Cardano, Grant Cardone, and Peter Diamandis. Scaramuccis invest millions in Trump-backed Bitcoin miner Solari Capital, an investment firm led by AJ and Anthony Scaramucci, reportedly contributed more than $100 million in a July funding round for American Bitcoin . This is of note because of the Bitcoin mining company’s ties to Donald Trump’s sons. Anthony Scaramucci, AJ’s father and the founder of SkyBridge Capital, made a smaller personal investment, although he did not share the exact amount. Anthony Scaramucci is well-known for his short stint as White House communications director under Donald Trump and also for being quite critical of him afterward. However, both he and his son have been investing in American Bitcoin. The pair have said that their motive is their belief in the power of Bitcoin despite their dissatisfaction with Trump. AJ has even closer ties with American Bitcoin’s president, Matt Prusak, who was his roommate at Stanford Business School. According to Fortune , Prusak told AJ that American Bitcoin was being spun off from Hut 8, and AJ jumped on the opportunity. American Bitcoin’s operations American Bitcoin was launched by Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., in partnership with Hut 8. As part of the deal, Hut 8 contributed “substantially all” of its Bitcoin mining equipment, in exchange for 80% of the company’s shares. The Trump family reportedly holds the remaining stake. After a reverse merger in September, American Bitcoin began trading on the Nasdaq. According to its filings, it operates mining facilities in places including the Niagara Falls in Canada and Texas, with tens of thousands of mining rigs. As of mid-November 2025, American Bitcoin said it held 4,004 BTC, worth roughly $415 million at the time. According to a regulatory filing reported by Cryptopolitan, American Bitcoin raised the full $220 million through a private share placement. About $10 million of the amount was paid in Bitcoin instead of cash. The reported average “cost” for those shares was about $104,000 per Bitcoin, according to the same filing. Out of that capital, American Bitcoin said it would use some of it to buy more mining gear and also to build up its Bitcoin treasury. Eric Trump described American Bitcoin as a way to profit from Bitcoin without buying Bitcoin directly, a “proxy play” as he called it. This is similar to what Michael Saylor does with his company, which buys huge amounts of Bitcoin and lets investors gain exposure by owning the company’s stock. The Trump family’s publicly traded media business has also announced plans to raise $2.5 billion to build a Bitcoin treasury.

The launch of the Canary Capital XRP ETF (XRPC) generated strong demand, posting more than $58 million in trading volume and attracting approximately $245 million in net inflows on its first trading day. This outcome has intensified market attention ahead of additional XRP ETF rollouts expected from several major issuers. Market Expectations Surrounding Upcoming XRP ETFs Following XRPC’s introduction , focus has shifted to the six remaining spot XRP ETFs that are awaiting their market debuts. Firms such as Grayscale, 21Shares, Franklin Templeton, and Bitwise are among the issuers preparing to enter the space. Should these products record even partial demand comparable to XRPC’s initial performance, they could collectively bring a sizable amount of new capital into the XRP market. If each of the remaining six funds were to attract half of XRPC’s opening-day inflows, the combined amount entering the market could exceed $700 million in their first sessions alone. While such symmetry is improbable, given varying investor preferences, issuer reputations, and timing differences, the possibility of substantial inflows has encouraged speculative modeling around how extended investment could influence XRP’s valuation. To provide a clearer assessment, this analysis examines a scenario in which all seven spot ETFs collectively receive $600 million in net inflows every month for one year. Although this estimate surpasses the inaugural figures from XRPC, it remains below the $10 billion that Canary Capital’s CEO projected could enter the products in their first month. Under the assumed conditions, 12 months of $600 million inflows would total $7.2 billion. Projected Effects on XRP’s Valuation Determining how ETF inflows translate into market capitalization presents difficulties, as inflows do not convert directly into price appreciation. A range of variables, including liquidity conditions, macroeconomic influences, and sell-side activity, can alter the relationship between inflows and realized market value. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 To form a conservative approximation, this analysis applies a 100× inflow multiplier, a framework sometimes used in digital asset modeling when estimating the broader impact of regulated investment products. Applying that multiplier to the simulated $7.2 billion inflow produces a hypothetical market capitalization increase of $720 billion. With XRP’s current valuation near $135 billion , the combined figure would be approximately $857 billion. Considering the circulating supply of roughly 60 billion tokens, this projected market capitalization corresponds to a potential price level of about $14.20 per XRP. Context From Ethereum’s ETF Inflow History Although this model presents an optimistic projection, historical trends indicate that strong ETF inflows do not guarantee price appreciation. Between November 2024 and October 2025, Ethereum-based ETFs recorded only one month of net outflows. Over those 12 months, the products accumulated a combined net inflow of roughly $14.7 billion. Despite these substantial inflows, Ethereum did not experience a sustained price increase due to broader market pressures and supply-side dynamics. This example illustrates that large inflows alone may be insufficient to drive consistent upward price movements. Overall, while the scenario of $600 million in monthly inflows is theoretically possible and has precedent in other crypto ETF markets, its direct effect on XRP price would depend on numerous external conditions. ETF demand is only one of several factors that determine long-term price behavior, and real-world results may differ significantly from modeled outcomes.

This indicates that Solaria is eager to integrate itself into the heart of the burgeoning European market for AI-based electricity . The new platform is built on a foundation of 3.4 gigawatts of already consolidated grid access in Spain, Italy, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Solaria has also applied for another 5 gigawatts, underscoring the company’s desire to secure as much capacity as possible in the lead-up to industry competition. The company hopes to finalize a deal by next summer, its nearby observers said. Neither Solaria nor Goldman Sachs released publicly available information. AI growth reshapes Europe’s power and data-center landscape. AI is drastically changing the world’s energy demand on a massive scale. Powerful training and running complex intelligence systems on AI models require a significant amount of electricity. Analysts suggest that power consumption due to AI could quadruple by the end of the next decade. Meanwhile, growing pressure is already mounting on data center developers and tech companies to identify large, long-term power supplies. The trend is more pronounced in Europe. Energy needs from data centers are anticipated to increase dramatically, potentially generating tens of gigawatts of new renewable capacity by 2030. Since solar energy has been regarded as a significant alternative to traditional energy sources, and its costs are falling steadily, Solaria is also moving quickly to stay ahead. These commitments are pressuring hyperscalers to align with energy developers who can guarantee not only capacity but also speed — areas in which Solaria has already demonstrated strength. The company’s home market, Spain, ranks among the most attractive to AI centers in Europe. It has ample sunlight, available land, and strong connections to undersea cables that cross the Atlantic, connecting Europe to Africa and the Americas. By 2035, data centers in Spain could account for as much as 6% of the country’s overall electricity demand, underscoring the importance of new renewable energy capacity. Solaria steps up investments to underpin its data-center strategy. Solaria accelerates investments to anchor its data-center strategy There already exists 1.2 gigawatts of grid-connection rights at Solaria, which are reserved for data-center development inside the territory that belongs to Spain. For example, Solaria signed a key memorandum of understanding in 2024 with Japan’s Datasection Inc. to construct a 200-megawatt AI data center at its Puertollano complex, in the city of Puertollano. This site features facilities in clean rooms, as well as the original manufacturing sites for photovoltaic cells, making it easily adaptable for advanced technology installations. The Puertollano project alone will cover nearly 100,000 square metres, a reflection of Solaria’s ambition to become a leader in energy and infrastructure collaboration for the global AI community. Solaria’s growth is supported by its strong financials. The company’s shares have now risen by almost 100% this year, thanks to investor confidence in its energy pipeline and its presence in the AI and data center space. A major part of the company’s ongoing rollout of solar projects and its goal to achieve 14.3 gigawatts of total capacity by 2028 through solar, wind, and battery storage is boosting revenues and profits. Should Solaria find a firm to partner with on this 3.4-gigawatt platform, it could become one of Europe’s leading suppliers of clean-powered data center infrastructure. The project is a fusion of two key global transitions — the move to renewable energy and the ascendance of AI computing. For big tech companies, the deal is a potential route to long-term clean energy for next-generation data centers. For Europe, it’s also a sign of how the continent’s energy and digital strategies are starting to connect. For Solaria, this represents a significant leap from being a top solar developer to a key player in the infrastructure supporting an AI revolution. Get seen where it counts.

Analysts weighed on this increase, asserting that it likely resulted from their decision to accept Bitcoin at their restaurants. Therefore, with this move, Steak ‘n Shake has become popular in the Bitcoin community and demonstrates a growing trend among merchants beginning to accept Bitcoin for various goods and services. Additionally, sources noted that the decision to accept BTC for small, everyday purchases is a significant step toward broad acceptance. Interestingly, Steak ‘n Shake also revealed considering using Ether as a payment option at its locations to explore the crypto ecosystem further. This intention was made public after the company shared an X post last month asking individuals whether it is a good idea for them to start using Ether. Concerning crypto investors, sources close to the situation mentioned that this proposal sparked excitement in the ecosystem, showing that Steak ‘n Shake is interested in the industry as cryptocurrencies become more popular among individuals. A survey from a reliable source revealed that, out of 48,815 followers surveyed, approximately 53% voted in favor of the proposal. These results contributed to a strong reaction from the Bitcoin community . However, like other proposals, this suggestion received criticism from BTC supporters. To illustrate this claim, Bitcoin supporter Ron Sovereignty Swanson responded to the survey, mentioning that “ETH is just centralized trash. Bitcoin represents freedom. If you do this, you’ll lose all your Bitcoiner customers, including me.” Steak ‘n Shake dropped its intention to offer an ETH payment option Recent reports highlighted that although Steak ‘n Shake initially pledged to abide by the results of the social media poll, the company later reversed its decision to offer an ETH payment option. In a statement dated October 11, the same day they started the poll, the company said , “Poll canceled. We stand with Bitcoiners. You have made your choice known. Who even suggested this? I’m back at my desk.” Meanwhile, Steak ‘n Shake reported high sales for the third quarter of the fiscal year in November. According to their report, they experienced a 15% increase in same-store sales compared to the previous quarter. Moreover, for the same-store sales growth in the third quarter, the company surpassed all its competitors in the fast food sector. These rivals include McDonald’s, Burger King, Taco Bell, and Starbucks .

His post focused on the widely quoted figure of seven million XRP wallets and explained why this number does not represent the number of real holders. The clarification arrives at a time when XRP is now positioned to start to receive institutional inflows from the recently launched Canary Spot XRP ETF. Related Reading: Dogecoin Alert! Price Could Explode Over 2,800%, Analyst Says Why Wallet Count Does Not Equal Holder Count CryptoTank noted that nearly 7 million wallets holding XRP does not translate to millions of people owning the asset. He pointed out that he personally maintains roughly 30 wallets, and most committed XRP investors tend to operate between four and six on average. This means a single individual can appear multiple times in on-chain statistics, making the total wallet count an unreliable indicator of how many real participants exist. The view is simple: the actual number of distinct XRP holders is far lower than many assume, and he believes the true figure sits comfortably below 1 million worldwide. This paints a picture of a community that is still at an early stage compared to other major digital assets. If only a fraction of those seven million addresses belong to unique individuals, then the people who hold XRP today represent a much smaller, far earlier group than estimates imply. CryptoTank described this group as being “way ahead” of the world, meaning that current holders occupy a position that could become far more valuable once broader participation finally arrives. A small holder base means that any meaningful expansion in demand, whether retail or institutional, could have an outsized effect on price because the XRP price has not yet experienced the type of mass inflow seen in previous cycles for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Institutional Expansion With Spot XRP ETF This discussion arrives at a significant moment for XRP, particularly with the introduction of the newly launched Spot XRP ETF in the United States. The product widens XRP’s reach beyond its early holder group, allowing institutions and retail traders in regulated markets to also invest in the cryptocurrency. If the true population of XRP holders is small, the arrival of ETF demand could become a major turning point. As inflows grow, this new access point may mark the beginning of a shift from an early-holder community to a broader institutional and retail audience. Speaking of inflows, Canary’s Spot XRP ETF started its first full trading day with $243.05 million in inflows on November 14, according to data from SoSoValue.

Accordingly, even as Ethereum continues to rank among the top assets, smart investors are increasingly focusing their attention on early-stage cryptocurrencies with greater potential, and Mutuum Finance , an asset trading under the symbol MUTM, is quickly gaining traction as a next big crypto and the top crypto to buy before the market recognizes its significance. Currently at a low price point of just $0.035, MUTM is in presale phase 6, well over 90% sold, garnering over $18.8 million so far. Ethereum (ETH) Faces Key Resistance, Traders Remain Cautious The Ethereum network (ETH) recently tested its former support level at approximately $3,675, but this was rejected, and we’re now seeing prices drop below the Daily 200 EMA once again, which is a sign that investors are still cautious at this stage. Although the 200MA may provide a degree of support in the near-term, ETH will have to break out past the $3,700 mark if market sentiment is to return to a positive trajectory. Until this breakout is achieved, market participants are cautious about potential downward pressure. As a result of the technical hindrances presented by ETH, market interest is now focusing increasingly on Mutuum Finance (MUTM), considered the next big crypto and a top crypto to buy. Mutuum Finance Presale Soars Ahead Mutuum Finance is rapidly making a name among the most eagerly awaited DeFi crypto launches of 2025. Currently, the presale stage has already seen over 17,980 participants, raising over $18.8 million, with Phase 6 well over 90% complete, and MUTM tokens valued at $0.035, an appreciable hike compared to the initial Phase 1 price of $0.01. The presale is now moving into Phase 7, and the price per token will increase by 20%, pushing the price closer to the listing price, which is $0.06 per token. As the price continues to move upwards and Mutuum Finance is well-received due to growing mainstream acceptance, this seems like an ideal investment opportunity, guaranteeing strong returns on investment in the crypto market. Investors looking for the next big crypto and a top crypto to buy are increasingly turning to MUTM. Stablecoin Development & Layer 2 Scalability One of the most important forthcoming initiatives that Mutuum Finance will embark on is the development of an over-collaterized stablecoin. The development of a stablecoin is crucial as far as the liquidity dynamics of the ecosystem is concerned, as this will allow lending and borrowing activities to occur predictably and will keep the funds circulating in the ecosystem. Further, Mutuum Finance is working to integrate a Layer-2 solution, which will increase transaction speed as well as lower costs. It will therefore make the service even more enticing to individual investors, as well as institutional investment firms, thus benefiting Mutuum Finance as a lending service operating in the DeFi space. Strategic Project Positioning The presale offer by Mutuum Finance is structured to bring a set of key features that will drive the demand for the tokens, as well as a strong foundational approach. The project aims to attract both beginners and advanced users of DeFi services. A major advantage is having a dual lending structure that brings together lenders, borrowers, and liquidators to ensure liquidity. The interest rates can either be stable or variable, with the former offering safety when market volatility arises. The system will be fully functional as of the first day, so lending/borrowing will be possible immediately after the listing of the tokens, meaning that the value will depend directly on the operation of the system, creating a market from inception rather than having to wait months to see results. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already seen the successful raising of over $18.8 million from the involvement of around 18,000 participants, with Phase 6 well over 90% sold and tokens at just $0.035, although this will rise by a further 20% as it enters Phase 7. Offering a dual lending DeFi system, as well as rewards via staking, Mutuum Finance is an opportunity that will bring investors on board as a valuable early-stage project, well before widespread acceptance, making it the next big crypto and the top crypto to buy today.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-you-are-very-wrong-about-this-xrp-dump-heres-why/,"The current plunge in XRP has rattled many traders, but a close look suggests that panic may be misplaced. Rather than signaling a brutal bear capitulation, the recent drop could actually be laying the groundwork for a powerful rebound. Monthly Stochastic RSI: A Historical Buy Zone According to STEPH IS CRYPTO, the monthly Stochastic RSI for XRP is once again approaching a key support zone around 40. Historically, this level has acted as a strong trough after a full overbought cycle. Steph points out that in both the 2017 and 2021 bull runs, XRP’s Stochastic RSI dropped from overbought, found support near 40, and then exploded higher. He argues that the current setup strongly mirrors those prior inflection points. Bearish Candle, Bullish Implication Steph also highlights the October monthly candle, which left a prominent lower wick on the XRP chart. He interprets this as a sign of rejection — a classic liquidity hunt where weak hands were flushed out before price reversed. Such wicks often mark local lows or bear market capitulation zones, according to his analysis. You Are VERY Wrong About This #XRP Dump. pic.twitter.com/awPUQCdNxd — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) November 15, 2025 Other Signals Align On shorter timeframes, Steph points to a liquidation heatmap showing a large cluster of short positions stacked above the current XRP price. In his view, this creates strong potential for a short squeeze. If XRP reverses upward, those short trades could be forced to cover, adding upward fuel to the rally. While some traders are alarmed by a recent daily “death cross” — when the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day — Steph challenges the bearish interpretation. He notes that similar patterns have appeared near prior bottoms. Rather than signaling a long-term breakdown, he argues this could be a setup for another major leg up. Steph further emphasizes the daily RSI, which he says is breaking out in a way that historically preceded strong upside moves. For him, this adds to the narrative that the recent drop is not pure weakness, but part of a broader accumulation phase. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Context: Optimism & Skepticism The broader XRP community appears split. Some analysts echo Steph’s bullish case, pointing to the Stochastic RSI pattern and liquidity structure as compelling. Others warn of near-term risks: renewed selling pressure, whale unloads, and potential retests of lower support. Still, even among skeptics, a common refrain is do not panic: many view the volatility as clearing the path for a bigger move. A Tactical Opportunity, Not a Breakdown Steph Is Crypto’s framework suggests this is not a breakdown, but a tactical setup . The convergence of a historically bullish Stochastic RSI level, a capitulation-style wick, and clustered short liquidity makes the case for a potential bounce strong. While nothing is guaranteed in crypto, his analysis argues that the current dump might be precisely the type of reset that precedes a major move higher. If history repeats, this could mark the beginning of a renewed bullish cycle for XRP, not the end. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The cryptocurrency market just witnessed a significant movement as Bitcoin price tumbled below the crucial $95,000 mark. According to real-time market data from Bitcoin World, BTC is currently trading at $94,994.63 on the Binance USDT market, sending ripples across the entire crypto ecosystem. Why Did Bitcoin Price Drop Below $95,000? The sudden Bitcoin price correction caught many investors by surprise. Market analysts point to several contributing factors that triggered this downward movement. First, increased selling pressure from large holders created temporary imbalance in market liquidity. Second, global economic uncertainties continue to influence investor sentiment across all risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Technical indicators also played a role in this Bitcoin price movement. The $95,000 level served as a key psychological support zone. When this level broke, it triggered automated sell orders and stop-loss positions, accelerating the decline. However, experienced traders often view such corrections as healthy market adjustments that create new buying opportunities. What Does This Bitcoin Price Movement Mean for Investors? Understanding market cycles is crucial for cryptocurrency investors. The current Bitcoin price action demonstrates several important market characteristics: Volatility remains inherent in cryptocurrency markets Key support levels often trigger significant price movements Market sentiment can shift rapidly based on technical breaks Trading volume typically increases during major price movements For long-term investors, these fluctuations represent normal market behavior. The fundamental value proposition of Bitcoin remains unchanged despite short-term price movements. Many analysts consider these dips as potential entry points for investors who missed earlier opportunities. How to Navigate Bitcoin Price Volatility? Successful cryptocurrency investing requires strategic thinking during price swings. When the Bitcoin price experiences significant movements, consider these approaches: Dollar-cost averaging reduces timing risk Portfolio diversification manages overall exposure Risk management protects against extreme volatility Fundamental analysis helps maintain long-term perspective Remember that cryptocurrency markets operate 24/7, and price movements can reverse quickly. The current Bitcoin price situation may present different opportunities for various types of investors, from day traders to long-term holders. What’s Next for Bitcoin Price Action? Market watchers are closely monitoring several key levels that could influence future Bitcoin price direction. The $94,000-$95,000 zone now becomes crucial for determining short-term momentum. A sustained break below could test lower support levels, while recovery above $96,000 might signal renewed bullish sentiment. Institutional interest continues to grow despite price fluctuations. Major financial institutions and corporations maintain their Bitcoin exposure, suggesting confidence in the long-term value proposition. This institutional participation often provides stability during retail-driven volatility episodes. Final Thoughts on Current Market Conditions The cryptocurrency market demonstrates its dynamic nature once again with this Bitcoin price movement. While breaking below $95,000 captures headlines, experienced investors understand that these fluctuations represent normal market behavior. The fundamental adoption story continues unfolding, with technological developments and institutional integration progressing steadily. Market corrections often separate emotional reactions from strategic decisions. Successful investors typically focus on long-term trends rather than short-term price movements. The current Bitcoin price action serves as another reminder about the importance of risk management and disciplined investment strategies in volatile markets. Frequently Asked Questions Why did Bitcoin price drop below $95,000? The decline resulted from combination of technical factors breaking key support levels, increased selling pressure, and broader market sentiment shifts affecting risk assets. Should I sell my Bitcoin during this price drop? Investment decisions should align with your financial goals and risk tolerance. Many investors use dips as buying opportunities, while others maintain their long-term positions regardless of short-term fluctuations. How low could Bitcoin price go? Predicting exact price levels is impossible, but technical analysts monitor support zones around $92,000 and $90,000 as potential areas where buying interest might increase. Will Bitcoin price recover quickly? Cryptocurrency markets can reverse rapidly, but recovery timing depends on multiple factors including market sentiment, trading volume, and broader economic conditions. Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? Price corrections often attract buyers seeking better entry points, but always conduct personal research and consider your investment strategy before making decisions. How does this affect other cryptocurrencies? Bitcoin price movements typically influence the broader cryptocurrency market, with many altcoins showing correlated price action during significant BTC movements. Found this analysis helpful?

The revised outlook, due to be released next week, indicates that Europe’s recovery is much shakier than officials had anticipated. EU officials say increasing U.S. tariffs and unresolved trade disputes are now the top obstacles to growth. The Trump administration’s tariff measures, introduced last year, continue to affect European exporters, particularly in manufacturing-dominated sectors such as steel, machinery, and automobiles. Brussels had expected pressures to abate by 2026, but had also anticipated a modest recovery. Previous estimates put growth at around 1.4%. That estimate is now expected to be drastically lower, reflecting the cumulative impact of trade barriers and investor risk. The jolts from U.S.-EU trade tensions are also giving businesses pause. Local companies are deferring investments amid fears about market access, supply chain risks, and the uncertainty of tariffs. Emerging global competition, a stronger euro, and a downturn in foreign demand are also contributing to headwinds for the export outlook. The uncertainty itself, economists say, is now one of Europe’s most serious economic threats, as opposed to the tariffs alone. Confidence has declined, supply-chain planning has become more difficult, and the specter of further escalation in trade looms over every forecast. Major economies lose momentum Germany, the EU’s largest economy , is experiencing a particularly challenging time. Yet despite expanding public spending on defense and infrastructure, the nation’s recovery has lagged. Industrial production has struggled to gain traction, and Germany’s chronic competitiveness woes have taken root. What was counted on to be Germany’s best post-pandemic year of growth has now become just another disappointing cycle. The country’s Council of Economic Experts recently cut its 2026 growth forecasts to 1%, citing weaker global demand and higher production costs. France, the bloc’s second-largest economy, faces a different challenge. Growth has proven resilient, but political instability is weighing on consumer and investor confidence. An estimated half-percentage point of France’s growth for the year is being cut by uncertainty, including domestic political disputes and budget tensions, according to analysts. Across the region, policymakers are also issuing warnings about structural risks, including rising energy costs, demographic shifts, and widening innovation gaps compared to the United States and certain parts of Asia. The European Central Bank has already moved to help prop up the struggling economy. It has cut interest rates several times this year, aiming to stabilize credit conditions and stimulate investment. However, ECB officials recognize that monetary policy alone cannot alleviate the weight of drag caused by external trade pressures. In its latest assessment, the ECB stated that ‘elevated uncertainty, high effective tariffs and tightening global competition’ remain key issues that impede Europe’s recovery momentum. Business investment is weak, and exports are not expected to recover overnight without a deceleration of global tensions. Fiscal policy, on the other hand, is stretched. Policy responds, but risks stay high A handful of member countries, including Italy, made strides in stabilizing public finances; others, such as France, are expected to post some of the largest deficits in the euro area. Divergent budget approaches can compromise the EU’s ability to forge a coordinated, strong collective response. EU leaders today are seeking to strike the right balance between the need to bolster domestic competitiveness and the complexities of the geopolitical environment. For the bloc, this means working to boost investment in technology, clean energy, industrial resilience, and other areas to shield the bloc from external shocks. Politically, Brussels continues to pursue stability in trade relations with Washington. Any easing of tariff pressures or steps toward new deals could quickly boost the economic outlook. However, officials warn that the threat of new trade disputes is “high,” and that Europe would need to prepare for a prolonged era of global fragmentation. By now, the message from Europe’s institutions is clearer than ever: the recovery is slowing, trade pressures are growing, and without a decisive response, growth prospects for the region will continue to fade into 2026.

During an interview with the Finnish newspaper published on Saturday, November 15, Rehn highlighted that reduced energy prices, lowered wage and service inflation, and a stronger euro could result in the overall inflation dropping significantly compared to their 2% target. “This risk should not be taken lightly,” the governor added when asked whether the ECB might reduce interest rates again in December. However, Rehn also stated that there are risks of escalating inflation to consider. Therefore, with inflation near ECB’s 2% goal, investors and economists do not expect sudden alterations to the deposit rate. Notably, the deposit rate has decreased approximately eight times during this cycle, from 4% to 2%. Rehn warned that the stock markets are clearly in danger of a crash The euro area economy has demonstrated impressive performance despite US President Donald Trump’s tariff policies interfering with global trade. According to reports from the governor of the Bank of Finland speaking to Helsingin Sanomat , the growth experienced in this single-currency region is slow but steady. Rehn, also the Governor of the International Monetary Fund for Finland, weighed in on this progress. He warned that the stock markets are clearly in danger of a crash . His remarks highlighted the importance of banks maintaining strong capital buffers. This was after Rehn acknowledged that stock prices are high due to the rise of AI in the US, although actual economic growth and firm profits are not surging as quickly. Therefore, according to the governor, such a scenario needs them to exercise caution. In the meantime, sources mentioned that Rehn is running for the vice president of the ECB, with support from Finnish Finance Minister Riikka Purra. On the other hand, Latvia, a member of the European Central Bank system, has announced that it will propose a candidate for the six-member Executive Board. However, whether Martins Kazaks will be the central bank governor has not been confirmed. The euro zone’s different growth rate sparks concerns for the ECB Analysts have recently discovered that the eurozone’s economic expansion is masking a gap, with almost half of the region experiencing either no growth or contraction . This situation ignited concerns for the European Central Bank as it weighed whether more rate cuts were necessary. This finding was noted after reports released on Friday, November 14, demonstrated that output rose 0.2% in the third quarter compared to the last three months. These results sparked optimism among investors that recovery was picking up speed. However, an analysis revealed that nations accounting for 49% of the eurozone’s overall economic output did not experience any growth during this period. To support this claim, the analysis mentioned that Germany, the largest economy in Europe, and Italy both encountered no progress. According to sources, this is a problem the European Central Bank is aware of. This was after the Vice President, Luis de Guindos, said earlier this month that officials should note the different growth rates. In their meeting in September, the bank officials expressed concerns that Spain’s strong economic performance was primarily due to a rapid expansion rate, while other nations were struggling. Meanwhile, sources stated that although the central bank reduced borrowing costs eight times, this situation may not alone prompt policymakers to pursue further rate cuts. Still, it will be a consideration as they begin to view other risks to inflation, such as a possible delay in the European Union’s carbon pricing plan.

Daily trade disclosures from Friday show that the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF acquired 18,089 BitMine shares. The ARK Next Generation Internet ETF purchased an additional 34,637 shares. The ARK Innovation ETF added the largest amount at 116,681 shares. In total, ARK bought 169,407 BitMine shares on the day, an investment valued at approximately $5.83 million. Separately, ARKF bought 8,063 shares of Bullish. ARKW added 15,441 shares. ARKK acquired 52,011 more. These combined purchases amounted to 75,515 Bullish shares worth roughly $2.91 million. Buying During Market Weakness The renewed accumulation came as both stocks were hit by heavy selling pressure. Bullish closed down 6.19% at $38.48. BitMine fell nearly 6% to $34.40. Both recovered slightly in after-hours trading. ARK’s steady buying during dips has become a recurring strategy, particularly as the firm positions itself more aggressively in digital-asset-linked equities. ARK’s Expanding Crypto Acquisition Strategy This latest move follows ARK’s recent multi-day acquisition of Circle (CRCL) shares. Over two days last week, the firm purchased 542,269 Circle shares for a combined cost of roughly $46 million. The buying took place as Circle’s stock continued to decline, falling first to $86 and then to $82.30. These transactions mark ARK’s first Circle purchases since June, when the firm sold approximately 1.7 million shares at an average price of $200, generating $352 million. ARK has also continued to expand its position in BitMine. On Thursday, the firm purchased 242,347 additional BitMine shares for around $8.9 million after the stock dropped below $37. BitMine’s Leadership Shift Adds Further Attention BitMine has drawn broader market interest following its announcement of a leadership transition. The firm confirmed that Chi Tsang has replaced Jonathan Bates as CEO, and it also appointed three new independent board members. More than 3.5 million Ether — valued at over $11 billion — now sits in BitMine’s treasury. The company’s transformation from a mining-focused business to a major institutional holder of Ethereum has intensified comparisons to Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which maintains the largest Bitcoin treasury among publicly traded firms. ARK’s Long-Term Positioning in Crypto Markets ARK’s ongoing crypto-related acquisitions indicate confidence in long-term growth opportunities despite near-term volatility across digital asset markets. The firm’s activity aligns with its broader investment philosophy, which favors high-growth, high-risk innovation sectors even during downturns. Whether this accumulation continues will likely depend on how crypto-linked equities perform as broader macroeconomic conditions evolve.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-11-16 03:07:08

54463645,https://timestabloid.com/?p=89731,1763262945,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Top 10 Altcoins: MoonBull Sets the Stage as the Best Crypto Presale,https://timestabloid.com/top-10-altcoins-moonbull-sets-the-stage-as-the-best-crypto-presale/,"Crypto presales are entering a new golden cycle – one where early positioning can dramatically change an investor’s outcome. The difference between buying during presale versus entering after listing can be the difference between a 2× and a 200× return, which is why the search for the best crypto presale has become one of the most competitive conversations in the market. What makes this list unique is that each crypto here deserves its place, whether through explosive presale mechanics, real-world utility, institutional traction, ecosystem depth, or community momentum. And at the top is MoonBull, the only project in this lineup offering presale investors real governance power before the token even reaches exchanges. Here are the 10 best cryptos shaping the best crypto narrative this cycle. 1. MoonBull (MOBU): Join Best Crypto Presale Right Now MoonBull earns the spotlight because it is one of the rare presale tokens granting voting power (1 token = 1 vote) during the presale stages. While most early-stage tokens ask investors to wait until after launch before governance is enabled, MoonBull flips this model by offering community decision-making from the earliest phases. This means holders can influence pressing topics like liquidity deployment, staking rates, treasury usage, strategic partnerships, token burns, feature releases, and community incentives. The presale itself is also structured for value acceleration – currently in Stage 6 at $0.00008388, MoonBull has already raised more than $600K and built a holder base of over 2,000 participants. With a listing price of $0.00616, Stage 6 buyers are positioned for a potential ROI of over 7,244%, while early-stage entrants have already secured returns of more than 235% based on tier progression alone. User Benefits of Voting Power Voting Power transforms investors from passive speculators into active governors of the ecosystem. Large holders gain proportionate influence in decision-making, while smaller holders still participate in shaping future updates. This keeps developers accountable, aligns long-term incentives, and creates a democratic feedback loop that helps prevent centralization of control. For users, this fosters trust, transparency, and community cohesion – traits that strengthen token value long after launch. MoonBull stands out among the best crypto presale opportunities for offering investors early influence, robust tokenomics, and a fast-growing community ahead of its listing. 2. Solana (SOL): The Chain Dominating High-Speed Crypto Activity Solana continues to rank among the most powerful blockchain networks in the world thanks to its unmatched transaction speed, micro-fee structure, and rapidly expanding ecosystem. While not a presale token, Solana makes this list because the majority of successful presales in the past two years have launched on SOL, leveraging its high throughput and cost efficiency. From NFTs to gaming to high-frequency DeFi, Solana has become a magnet for developers seeking reliable performance. Its daily active users consistently rival Ethereum and BNB Chain, and its thriving ecosystem supports some of the most hyped new launches. For investors hunting presale opportunities, SOL exposure ensures participation in one of the richest early-stage pipelines in the industry. Its performance in high-volume markets and institutional-level integrations continues to reinforce Solana as a core asset behind the presale economy. 3. BullZilla (BZIL): The Meme-Utility Ecosystem Built for Long-Term Expansion BullZilla earns its placement because it’s one of the few meme-ecosystem projects evolving beyond pure speculation. Built with a combination of meme culture, gamified staking, NFTs, and expanding community tools, BullZilla appeals to investors who want presale-style upside without lacking ecosystem structure. Its development roadmap includes play-to-earn integrations, membership benefits, and reward systems that encourage long-term holding over quick flips. Unlike typical meme coins that depend solely on hype cycles, BullZilla’s approach ties user engagement to growth, creating a more durable utility loop. Its strong social presence also positions it well during bullish meme seasons, while the utility framework provides resilience during corrections. This balanced approach places BullZilla firmly among the more promising early-stage crypto plays. 4. La Culex (CULEX): The Access-Utility Hybrid With Expanding Community Tools La Culex is increasingly recognized for its hybrid design: part utility token, part access token, part community-growth engine. Its ecosystem provides tools, gated content, platform functions, and user-driven features that increase demand as the community scales. The reason La Culex earns a spot in the best crypto presale lineup is its focus on user empowerment. Holders gain access to unique resources across community platforms, creating natural demand pressure and reducing the reliance on hype alone. The team continues expanding application layers, positioning La Culex as a project designed for long-term relevance rather than speculative pumps. As more utility layers roll out, the token becomes increasingly attractive to utility-first investors. 5. Apeing (APEING): Whitelist-Only Early Entry With Rapid Viral Momentum Apeing arrives on this list because its whitelist phase has already shown significant early traction, with demand outpacing allocation windows. Whitelist stages often produce the best risk-to-reward ratios, as supply is deliberately limited to early supporters rather than the open market. Apeing’s branding and community execution are built for virality; fast-paced social campaigns, momentum-driven launches, and token distribution mechanics that attract early-stage hunters. This is a high-energy meme ecosystem, and whitelist participants are positioned for favorable entry once Apeing transitions into its public phase. Its momentum, scarcity-driven whitelist access, and strong social footprint combine to justify its inclusion among the best crypto whitelist opportunities right now. 6. Avalanche (AVAX): The Custom Blockchain Network for Scalable Growth Avalanche has become a cornerstone network for enterprise blockchain solutions thanks to its subnets: custom blockchain environments that can operate independently while maintaining the security of the Avalanche network. AVAX earns its placement because investors increasingly seek ecosystems capable of long-term application hosting, and Avalanche excels in this regard. Its developer-friendly architecture, speed, and reliability make it a go-to choice for Web3 applications seeking scalable infrastructure. Institutional integrations and sustained ecosystem growth solidify AVAX as a long-term utility backbone for early-stage projects. 7. Ripple (XRP): The Global Liquidity and Payment Rail XRP remains one of the most adopted digital assets for cross-border payments, institutional liquidity solutions, and remittance systems. With regulatory clarity improving across major jurisdictions, XRP now faces fewer legal threats than in previous years, making it a safer diversification option for a growth-focused portfolio. XRP earns its spot because macro demand for global payment rails continues rising, and XRP’s technology is already years ahead of competitors in speed, cost, and adoption. While it won’t offer upside, its stability and utility make it an anchoring asset for strategic balance. 8. Hyperliquid (HYPER): The High-Engagement Early-Stage Breakout Candidate HYPER is building momentum rapidly due to its community-first approach, aggressive branding strategy, and early-stage positioning. Its utility is still unfolding, but its virality and user-acquisition growth have put it in the conversation among leading new projects. The token makes this list because community traction is one of the strongest predictors of success. HYPER shows all the early signals, fast follower growth, coordinated engagement, meme-driven content velocity, and active investor discussions. Early signals often precede explosive listing moments, making HYPER a high-risk, high-reward contender. 9. Monero: Privacy and Stability Monero focuses on privacy in a way few other cryptocurrencies can match. It protects transaction details using ring signatures, stealth addresses, and confidential amounts, keeping the sender, receiver, and value hidden from public view. This design attracts users who want financial autonomy without exposing their activity to outside tracking. The project maintains a steady position in the market, trading at 320.15 dollars, with a market cap of 5.9 billion dollars and a circulating supply of 18.44 million XMR. Its ongoing development is driven by an active community that maintains upgrades, audits, and research without relying on a central team. Monero’s commitment to privacy continues to draw both supporters and critics, yet its purpose remains clear. It delivers a currency that behaves like digital cash, offering confidentiality by default rather than as an optional feature. This makes it a consistent choice for users who value security and independence 10. Bitcoin Cash (BCH): The Fast, Low-Fee Transaction Engine Bitcoin Cash earns its place for its reliability in fast, low-cost transactions. It has seen renewed traction as payment adoption grows worldwide. While BCH is not an early-stage play like MoonBull or Apeing, its transaction efficiency and merchant-friendly model make it a dependable asset for diversifying crypto investment portfolios. Its steady growth and consistent community support allow investors to pair speculative positions with practical blockchain utility. Conclusion Based on the latest research and market trends, MoonBull stands as the most compelling early-stage opportunity, not simply because it’s in presale, but because it offers governance that begins before launch, Ethereum-backed reliability, and a community structure designed for long-term participation. SOL, AVAX, XRP, XMR, and BCH provide essential stability and utility; BullZilla, La Culex, Apeing, and HYPER deliver narrative-driven upside. But among them, MoonBull is the only one giving presale investors direct influence, structural advantages, and exponential-stage pricing. For anyone searching for the best crypto presale positioned for both early access and meaningful ecosystem power, MoonBull leads this cycle decisively.

Ethereum price is about to form a risky pattern The daily timeframe chart shows that the Ethereum price has remained under pressure in the past few months, moving from the all-time high of $4,950 to the current $3,185. ETH has continued to form a series of lower lows and lower highs, a sign that any attempt to rebound is funding strong resistance. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has moved from the overbought level of 87 in July to the current 35. This crash happened as the RSI formed a double-top pattern m Meanwhile, the Average Directional Index (ADX) has jumped to 37, a sign that the ongoing downtrend is gaining momentum in the past few days. The coin has also lost key support levels like $4,100, its highest level in December last year. It also moved below the important support level at $4,000, while the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) are about to cross each other, forming a death cross pattern , one of the riskiest signs in technical analysis. Therefore, the most likely Ethereum price forecast is bearish, with the next key support level to watch being at $2,877, the highest level in June this year. On the flip side, a move above the resistance at $3,500 will invalidate the bearish outlook. Ethereum price chart | Source: TradingView ETH price has numerous bearish catalysts The potential Ethereum price crash has some notable bearish catalysts that may push it lower in the near term. First, data compiled by SoSoValue shows that American investors have continued to dump their ETH ETFs. These funds shed over $728 million assets last week, higher than the $507 million they lost in the previous week. Spot Ethereum ETFs have shed over $1.24 billion this month, erasing the gains made in the past two consecutive weeks. The cumulative inflow has moved from almost $15 billion in the year to $13.1 billion today. They now have $20 billion in assets. Second, the Ethereum price may continue crashing because of deteriorating network activity that is likely caused by the waning participation in the market. Data shows that the number of transactions in the network dropped by 25% in the last 30 days to 45.7 million, while active addresses fell slightly to 8.19 million. Network fees plunged by 44% to 26.9 million. Third, Ethereum’s futures open interest has plunged to $37.4 billion by almost $70 billion in August. One reason for this is the huge liquidation event that happened on October 11. Ethereum’s funding rate has remained in a consolidation in the past few weeks.

The claim triggered a wave of reactions across the community, and a direct response from OKX CEO Star Xu. Xu is not taking the allegation lightly. Instead, he is turning the accusation into a challenge. Anyone who can prove a backdoor exists in OKX Wallet will receive 10 BTC from his own pocket. He shared this publicly, doubling down on security and transparency as core principles of the company. His message is clear: Show evidence, get paid. Link to the statement: 任何人只要能够提供确凿证据，证明 OKX Wallet 存在后门，我们的 @wallet 团队将奖励 10 BTC。请OKX Wallet全球几千万用户共同监督。安全透明是底线，欢迎社区审查。 https://t.co/yVtz4Mpa1f — Star (@star_okx) November 15, 2025 The crypto world is watching what comes next. The Accusation: A User Claims Their Wallet Was Drained The issue started when a user reported that their OKX Wallet had been drained of 50 ETH. The user claimed the theft happened because OKX Wallet had a built-in backdoor. According to them, this backdoor allowed an attacker to access their wallet and move funds without permission. In the world of Web3, few allegations are more damaging. A “backdoor” suggests intentional access, hidden control, or compromised trust at the code level, things no wallet provider can be associated with. But OKX sees the situation very differently. OKX Responds: “No Backdoor, This Was Phishing.” Shortly after the claim began circulating, OKX issued a formal response. The company denied the existence of any backdoor and said its initial review points to a phishing attack, not a wallet vulnerability. The team explained what they believe happened: The user interacted with a fake wallet signature page The phishing link was served through malicious Google search ads The victim unknowingly signed a fraudulent authorization The attacker used that signature to drain funds Phishing signatures remain one of the top attack vectors across DeFi. Users often face pop-ups that look identical to real ones, making it harder to tell the difference, especially when the link appears trustworthy. OKX maintains that the wallet’s code is secure. According to the company, the breach occurred at the user level, not the protocol level. Star Xu Raises the Stakes With a 10 BTC Challenge Things escalated when OKX CEO Star Xu weighed in personally. He said the accusation is baseless, and he is willing to put real money behind his stance. Anyone who can provide conclusive, verifiable evidence that OKX Wallet contains a backdoor will earn 10 BTC. This move is rare in the industry. Large exchanges and wallet providers often publish audits, but very few CEOs offer a public bounty for proof that they intentionally shipped compromised software. Xu’s challenge sends two signals: 1. Confidence, OKX believes its wallet code is clean. 2. Transparency, auditors, researchers, and users are invited to dig into the wallet’s open-source components. For an industry battling fraud allegations and security fears, this type of open challenge stands out. The Community Reacts: Security Anxiety Is Growing The accusation, even if unproven, sparked a wave of community responses. Crypto holders are increasingly worried about: Fake Google ads mimicking real crypto tools Malicious signature prompts that drain wallets instantly Wallet extensions targeted with social engineering Attackers buying ad placements to appear legitimate This case taps directly into those fears. Many users argue that even if OKX Wallet itself is safe, the ecosystem around it is getting more hostile. More phishing sites are appearing at the top of search results. Some even use the same branding, same colors, and same UX flows as the official tools. It only takes one mistaken click to lose everything. The Real Issue: Phishing Is Becoming More Sophisticated Phishing trends show that attackers are shifting away from technical exploits and focusing more on human behavior. Fake signature prompts are now one of the most successful forms of attack in crypto. The reason is simple: Wallets can be secure. Browsers can be secure. Smart contracts can be audited. But a user signing the wrong message bypasses all protections. In this case, OKX believes the attacker tricked the victim using: A counterfeit website A forged signature approval Misleading search ads These tactics are rising across the industry. It’s no longer enough for wallet providers to secure code, the broader environment users interact with is becoming part of the attack surface. Why This Matters: Education Is the First Line of Defense The incident underscores a critical reality. Even with secure wallets, users are vulnerable to human error. Phishing campaigns are: Getting harder to detect Using real branding Leveraging search engines Playing on trust in familiar interfaces This makes education essential. Users need to understand: Never sign unknown messages Always bookmark official links Double-check URLs Avoid clicking wallet-related ads Confirm permissions before approving anything A secure wallet cannot save a user from a fraudulent signature. What Happens Next? OKX says it is still reviewing the case. The community is waiting for more clarity. Security researchers are already inspecting the wallet code for anything unusual. But unless someone presents conclusive evidence of an actual backdoor, something Xu is confident does not exist, the 10 BTC bounty will likely go unclaimed. Still, the debate has put OKX in a global spotlight. The company now stands as an example of how exchanges might respond to user accusations: not with silence, but with open challenges and public accountability. Final Thoughts: A Wake-Up Call for the Industry The situation is bigger than one user’s stolen 50 ETH. It highlights a broader shift in crypto security, the danger is not always the technology. Often, it’s the interface between the user and the attack. As phishing campaigns take on more advanced forms, vigilance becomes the strongest defense. OKX’s 10 BTC challenge sends a strong message: the company is confident in its technology and willing to let the community verify it. Whether this turns into a resolved dispute or a long debate, one thing is clear, security in crypto is now a shared responsibility between platforms and users.

54469894,https://nulltx.com/?p=152683,1763270861,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Aster Pushes Major Token Unlocks to 2026 as Exchange Prepares for Its Biggest Trading Competition,https://nulltx.com/aster-pushes-major-token-unlocks-to-2026-as-exchange-prepares-for-its-biggest-trading-competition/,"The derivatives exchange Aster is rewriting its tokenomics playbook. Several major unlocks initially scheduled for 2025 have been canceled, delayed, or pushed more than a decade forward, marking the most significant shift in the project’s emission roadmap since launch. The update, first shared by @_FORAB and later confirmed by the Aster team, is already reshaping expectations around ASTER’s supply dynamics heading into 2026. The team says the move is simple: there is no need for the tokens right now. And with no demand pressure internally, the ecosystem unlocks won’t proceed, at least not until summer 2026, with several now pushed all the way to 2035. The announcement lands just before Aster launches the biggest trading competition in its history, a five-week, high-stakes perpetuals challenge with up to $10 million in rewards. Token Unlocks Pushed Back After Internal Review The first signal came from @_FORAB’s disclosure 确认变动！衍生品交易所 Aster 团队承认了，近期代币经济学出现了修改。 主要原因是币安上的 ASTER 代币数据显示，多个 2025 年原本的解锁被取消，移动到了 2026 年夏季，或更久的 2035 年。 团队回应道：原本最初的代币经济学，是每个月都有生态解锁，但鉴于 Aster 并没有使用的计划，就不解锁了。… pic.twitter.com/DdnLFjTx0K — AB Kuai.Dong (@_FORAB) November 15, 2025 The post highlighted a series of changes showing multiple ASTER unlocks, originally expected throughout 2025, now removed from the schedule or delayed. Aster quickly confirmed the data. According to the team, the original token economics included monthly ecosystem unlocks. These tokens were set aside for internal development, network growth, liquidity expansion, and ecosystem incentives. But as the team puts it, Aster “has no usage plan for those tokens at the moment.” This means, the tokens aren’t needed yet, so they’ll stay locked. Aster’s statement clarifies that all recently observed changes in the Binance token schedule reflect intentional restructures, not errors or sudden moves triggered by market pressure. The delay to 2026, and in some cases 2035, signals a long-term, conservative approach to supply release. ASTER Price Holds Above Key Entry Levels While the revised unlock schedule circulated through the market, ASTER’s price held steady. The token currently trades at $1.13, sitting comfortably above the widely-referenced Binance founder entry cost of $0.91. That puts the position at roughly 24% floating profit, even as broader crypto market sentiment remains weak. The delayed unlocks only add to that supportive backdrop. Less supply hitting the market means reduced short-term selling pressure, something traders quickly noticed. Still, the focus this week is less on charts and more on the coming event that is set to define Aster’s Q4. Aster Launches Its Biggest Perpetual Trading Competition Ever Aster isn’t slowing down. On the contrary—the exchange is preparing to kick off the most aggressive trading campaign in its history. Beginning 17 November, 00:00 UTC, and running through 21 December, 23:59 UTC, Aster will launch a five-phase perpetuals competition with up to $10 million in prizes. Each phase lasts exactly seven days. Each week resets. Each board clears. This is a “fresh fight” every week, the team says Aster’s biggest trading competition to date is about to begin. Double Harvest Era From 17 Nov, 00:00 UTC to 21 Dec, 23:59 UTC, Aster will run its biggest Perpetual competition yet: five weekly phases, up to $10,000,000 in prizes, and only 1,000 seats on the leaderboard… pic.twitter.com/Mw7N2fkK5k — Aster (@Aster_DEX) November 15, 2025 There are no rollover rankings, no accumulation advantages, and no time-weighted wins. Every phase is a clean slate. And perhaps the most unique element: Rewards are paid out immediately after each phase, with no end-of-event waiting period. How the Prize Pools Scale The size of each week’s prize pool depends entirely on the total Perpetual trading volume recorded during that phase. Traders aren’t just competing—they’re determining the size of the pot itself. Weekly Prize Pools: Under 100B volume → $1,000,000 At least 100B volume → $1,500,000 At least 150B volume → $2,000,000 If the highest tier is hit, the top-ranked trader takes home $300,000 in a single week. Only 1,000 leaderboard slots exist per phase. Only the highest volume traders qualify. And only those who cross specific volume thresholds are eligible for rewards. This structure ensures the pool is earned, not given. Eligibility Rules Are Strict To keep competition levels high, Aster has built tight criteria for payouts. To earn any reward: A trader must reach at least $100,000 in perpetual trading volume during the phase. To receive a top-3 prize: A trader must reach at least $5,000,000 in volume before the phase ends. Rewards are then distributed across rank bands, following the payout table published on Aster’s official channels. The rules are designed to prioritize consistent participation, not isolated high-risk bets. Double Rewards: Every Trade Works Twice Beyond the leaderboard, Aster is giving traders two simultaneous reward tracks for every trade executed during the campaign window. Each eligible trade: Earns Stage 4 points, and No additional steps. No opt-in. No separate workflows. One trading flow. Two reward systems. This mechanic is expected to drive significant volume spikes—especially in phases where the $2M pool is within reach. Aster will publish weekly leaderboard updates on its official Medium page. Each update includes: Phase volume Rank progressions Estimated unlocks for the prize pool Trader highlights Because phases are independent, a trader who performs poorly one week can return the next with no disadvantage. The system is intentionally merit-focused, favoring consistency but not punishing off-weeks. Aster Signals Confidence Going Into 2026 Between the delayed token unlocks and the launch of a $10M competition, Aster is signaling one message: The project is positioning for long-term growth, not short-term dilution. Delaying token emissions buys time. Running massive trading competitions accelerates adoption. Combining both is a strategy aimed at strengthening fundamentals before new token supply enters the market. And with unlocks now pushed to 2026—and some all the way to 2035—the team is clearly playing the long game. Double Harvest begins 17 November, 00:00 UTC. As Aster puts it: “Be ready when the window opens. The board won’t wait.” Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $2.33 by the end of 2028. By 2031, WIF’s price may surge to $3.79. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. However, a massive bear market ensued, and WIF lost momentum. Leaving investors asking: How high can dogwifhat crypto go? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $0.431 Market cap $425.94M Trading volume $115.20M Circulating supply 998.92M WIF All-time high $4.85 on (March 31, 2024) All-time low $0.000023 (November 2023) 24-hour high $0.4348 24-hour low $0.4127 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 8.76% (High) 50-day SMA $0.5883 14-Day RSI 34.99 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 10 (Extreme Fear) Green days 16/30 (53%) 200-Day SMA $0.7228 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown WIF is stabilizing but still under key trend resistance on both charts. Momentum is improving, but confirmation requires a break above $0.474 and $0.470 . Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart WIF is trading around $0.433 today (Nov 16, 2025), posting a mild rebound after several sessions of selling pressure. The price is still trapped below the mid-Bollinger band at $0.470, which currently acts as the first meaningful resistance separating WIF from a full recovery. The lower band near $0.381 remains the local support floor, and the recent bounce suggests buyers are defending that region. WIFUSDT 1-day chart by Tradingview Momentum remains soft, with the MACD still below the signal line, but the histogram has flattened and is edging toward the zero line, hinting at a slowing downtrend rather than a confirmed bullish reversal. The candles are beginning to form higher lows, showing early accumulation, but not yet strong enough to challenge the broader downtrend. Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart On the 4-hour timeframe, WIF is hovering around $0.431, where candles are starting to push into the Alligator EMAs, which remain compressed and angled downward. This indicates a trend slowdown but not a clear bullish turn yet. The blue Alligator line (the jaw) above price at $0.438–$0.440 is the nearest short-term ceiling. WIFUSDT 4-hour chart by Tradingview The MACD histogram has finally ticked into positive territory, showing buyers regaining micro-control after a long stretch of negative momentum. This aligns with the higher lows printed within the last 24 hours, suggesting WIF is attempting to base out. However, the rejection wicks remain noticeable, reflecting hesitation as price tests the cluster of Alligator resistance lines. Dogwifhat technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.5688 SELL SMA 5 $0.5373 SELL SMA 10 $0.5147 SELL SMA 21 $0.5200 SELL SMA 50 $0.5883 SELL SMA 100 $0.7316 SELL SMA 200 $0.7228 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.5147 SELL EMA 5 $0.5686 SELL EMA 10 $0.6558 SELL EMA 21 $0.7472 SELL EMA 50 $0.8376 SELL EMA 100 $0.8717 SELL EMA 200 $0.9792 SELL What to expect from WIF price analysis? WIF looks ready to consolidate and possibly grind upward, but the trend remains fragile. Traders can expect slow, choppy gains unless bulls decisively reclaim $0.470, which would signal a more meaningful recovery. Is Dogwifhat crypto a good investment? Dogwifhat (WIF) is a highly speculative meme coin fueled by online culture and community enthusiasm rather than fundamental utility or innovation. While it may present short-term opportunities for high-risk traders during bullish market sentiment, its long-term investment value remains questionable. With no clear roadmap, technical use case, or underlying utility, WIF’s price is largely driven by social media trends and investor speculation. For cautious or long-term investors, it poses significant risk and should only be considered in minimal portfolio allocations. Ultimately, dogwifhat is better suited for speculative play than strategic, utility-based crypto investing grounded in strong fundamentals. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Kraken, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank, and several other s . Will WIF reach $10? Having reached a peak price of $4.85 in 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Can Dogwifhat reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and could be unlikely. Its market must be at least $99.9 billion – a value that exceeds the highest market cap ever for a meme (Dogecoin) at $88.79 billion. DOGE’s marketcap history | GlobalData Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of approximately $1 by the end of 2025 and between $3.4 and $4.2 by 2031.

It is now hovering near its lowest level since June 27 this year. So, will the token continue falling as the death cross pattern forms? Solana price technical analysis as a death cross pattern forms The daily timeframe chart shows that the Solana price has plunged in the past few months, plunging from a high of $253, its lowest level in months. SOL price has moved below the ascending channel, confirming the bearish trend. Also, the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) have crossed each other, forming a death cross pattern. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator has dropped to 32 and is nearing the oversold level. Also, the Average Directional Index (ADX) has jumped to 41, its highest level since November last year. Solana price has moved below the Supertrend and the Ichimoku cloud indicators, a sign that bears remain in control for now. Therefore, the token will likely continue falling as sellers target the key support level at $125, its lowest level in June 22. A move below that support level will point to more downside, potentially to $100. On the flip side a move above the resistance level at $171 will invalidate the bearish outlook, potentially to the psychological level at $200. Solana price chart | Source: TradingView SOL price drops despite strong fundamentals Solana price could continue falling in the near term despite its strong fundamentals. Data compiled by Nansen shows that the number of Solana transactions rose by almost 10% in the last 30 days to over 1.8 billion. Active addresses jumped by 19% in the same period to 63.4 million. Still, Solana’s activity has been falling since June this year, moving from over 7 million in June to about 3.15 million today. This performance is likely because of the falling Solana meme coins. Another positive catalyst for Solana price is that ETF inflows jumped to over $382 million since October 28 this year. Its inflows have soared in each market today since the launch. The Bitwise Solana ETF has over $357 million, while the Grayscale fund has $24 million. Bitwise has net assets of over $446 million. Still, Solana has had some notable bearish catalysts. For example, the total stablecoin supply has dropped to $12.9 billion from the year-to-date high of $15.4 billion. Also, the DEX volume in its protocol will be lower this month than in October. It stood at about $64 billion, down from last month’s high of $148 billion. The other bearish catalyst for the SOL is that traders have reduced their leverage following the recent liquidation event in October. The futures open interest has dropped to about $7.2 billion, down from the September high of $17 billion.

In its report, the firm noted that BTC was starting to resemble a “digital savings asset,” seeing how it’s transferred far less often than Ethereum. In contrast, it compared ETH to digital oil, a token that’s both stored and constantly spent to power the network and back collateral. It wrote, “Bitcoin behaves like the digital savings asset it was designed to be, in that coins are largely hoarded, turnover is low, and recent behavior shows that more supply is migrating into long-term hold wrappers rather than sitting on exchanges.” Glassnode noted that Ethereum’s old tokens circulate much faster than Bitcoin’s Glassnode noted, however, that Ethereum’s activity mirrors what you’d expect from a high-throughput smart-contract network , especially since it’s supported by a large staking base and, more recently, boosted by ETF-driven investor demand. According to the report, the token’s long-term holders are circulating old coins three times faster than those of BTC, which suggests a utility-driven culture among holders. In practice, ETH fuels countless crypto operations; users need it to send digital dollars, make token trades on decentralized exchanges, or pay gas fees. The divergence in holder behavior between Bitcoin and Ethereum has become ‘more relevant than ever due to institutional engagement,’ say market analysts. Long-term trends in holding are often a testament to investors’ faith in the asset’s monetary properties. At the same time, a high velocity of a token generally reflects that the network demand has been strong. As crypto assets are increasingly scrutinized by institutions for their utility versus store-of-value factors, the behavior split between BTC and ETH is expected to impact portfolio allocation strategies as 2025 comes to an end. Although Ethereum functions less like a store of value than BTC, and its coins circulate more, Glassnode noted that it still has savings use cases — roughly 25% of the supply sits in staking and ETF products. Ethereum will launch the Fusaka upgrade this December These dynamics come at a pivotal time for Ethereum, which is preparing for the Fusaka upgrade in less than a month. On December 3, the Ethereum network will launch its new Fusaka upgrade, designed to provide increased scalability, lower gas fees, improved validator performance, smoother transaction movement, and stronger growth on Layer 2. The Fusaka rollout has investors on alert, much like Shanghai and Dencun did before, both of which enhanced the Ethereum network. Experts have suggested that the Fusaka upgrade could reinforce Ethereum’s position in decentralized finance and lay the groundwork for its growth in 2026. The update will set a per-transaction gas cap at 16.78 million units, preventing a single transaction from consuming an entire block, thereby improving network efficiency and reducing DoS risks. The overall block gas limit will also increase to 60 million units, enabling more transactions to be processed simultaneously. Bitcoin and Ethereum declined due to macro headwinds The cryptocurrency market took a downturn from November 10 to 14, as global risk aversion drove major coins lower. Bitcoin started the week at about $106,000 and declined to below $96,000 by November 14 — its lowest level in over six months. Bitcoin dropped after the Fed adopted a hawkish stance, snuffing out hopes of any near-term interest rate reduction and pushing speculative assets lower. Ethereum tracked Bitcoin’s downward trajectory, although milder, tumbling from $3,567 on November 10 to nearly $3,113 by the end of the week. Strong on-chain metrics and consistent institutional interest supported asset activity but were insufficient to offset the macroeconomic headwinds. The market reacted to global cues, rather than crypto-specific events, which pushed down the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum; however, analysts noted potential opportunities for entry.

However, the price faced strong bearish pressure at the level causing a decline to the $400 level where the price found support.

On the other hand, a bullish breakout would mean a rise to the $480 level with potential to cross the $500 mark. Is Monero a good investment? Monero is an attractive investment because it emphasizes privacy and security, utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure transaction confidentiality, which has created a strong demand in the market . Its growing adoption across various use cases and a decentralized development model enhance its long-term potential. With a limited supply and increasing investor interest, Monero offers a unique opportunity for those seeking financial autonomy and privacy to invest in cryptocurrency. However, investors should remain cautious of regulatory risks and market volatility when considering Monero as part of their portfolio, making it essential to seek investment advice. Why is XMR up? Monero price analysis shows that XMR saw a swift rise to the $440 mark before falling back to the $400 mark where it found support to continue the rally to the current $428 mark. Will XMR recover to its all-time high? Monero is expected to recover toward its all-time high of $518 by mid-2026 as the privacy chain continues to reduce its tech debt and progresses toward greater utility and privacy. However, the platform might have to overcome regulatory scrutiny and challenges before it can see mass adoption, as it remains highly speculative . How much will Monero be worth in 5 years? The Monero price prediction for 2030 suggests a minimum price of $1,048.76 and an average trading price of $1,142.11 . The maximum forecasted price is set at $1,208.35. Will XMR reach $1000? The chances of Monero (XMR) hitting $1,000 hinge on various factors, which will influence its future price movements. The adoption of privacy transactions and technological advances could increase demand. Favorable regulations and market sentiment toward privacy coins would also help. Yet, regulatory risks, competition, and market volatility are challenges that monero traders could face could hinder significant growth. $1,000 is possible with favorable conditions, especially considering the current price but market dynamics and regulations will shape its path. Does XMR have a good long-term future? Monero (XMR) has the potential for a strong long-term future due to its focus on privacy and security, which makes it attractive to users seeking anonymity. However, many investors have concerns regarding privacy, regulatory scrutiny, and notoriety from being the favored medium for some past criminals, which impact the current Monero sentiment. Monero’s commitment to ring confidential transactions and privacy gives it a solid foundation for long-term growth, but it must carefully navigate market and regulatory landscapes.

Johnny’s comments come as the XRP community anticipates how the market will respond when these products go live, with several more filings awaiting approval in the coming weeks. In a post shared on X, Johnny Krypto addressed the widespread optimism surrounding XRP’s price potential, noting that while enthusiasm is understandable, investors should “stay calm.” He referenced information he received from Google’s Gemini AI regarding how ETF issuers acquire XRP before a fund’s debut, clarifying a point that has generated considerable speculation within the community.

This initial purchase is known as seed capital and is intended to establish the ETF structure rather than accumulate large-scale reserves . Gemini noted that issuers are not permitted to pre-purchase significant quantities of XRP months before the launch. The regulatory process instead requires that major asset acquisitions occur only after the ETF begins trading , when demand is reflected through Authorized Participants who buy the asset on the open market. This ensures that large-scale purchases and any resulting market impact occur once the ETF is active, not beforehand, and that’s why the community has been anticipating ETF launches for years.

With the Canary Capital XRP ETF already trading, he explained that the performance of this single fund could provide key insights into how XRP’s price and liquidity might react when additional ETFs follow in the weeks ahead. He pointed out that the real observation begins when inflows start. As he stated, the focus should be on “how the price action and order books get eaten up based on the inflows of the one ETF.” This perspective aligns with how ETF markets typically operate, where initial investor activity and creation unit demand determine how quickly liquidity forms and whether upward price movement follows. Johnny Krypto noted that analyst Zach Rector will track inflows, outflows, and market cap multipliers to assess whether early institutional exposure to XRP leads to measurable market performance.

He referenced a regulatory document that he presented as evidence of favorable progress and connected it to rising expectations ahead of the launch of XRP trust shares. His remarks follow a similar post he made a day earlier, and together they form a narrative focused on regulatory advancement and the potential for substantial inflows once trading begins. This is what the sec approved for the “ XRP TRUST SHARES “ What they don’t want to show you. Anyway, besides all that, what matters is the PRICE movement.

He interpreted this as meaningful progress that supports the path for XRP trust shares to move forward. The order was placed on September 17, 2025, and involved Nasdaq, Cboe BZX, and NYSE Arca. Although the filing applies broadly to commodity-based trust shares, he presented it as a relevant step for XRP-related products. The approval of generic listing standards gives exchanges a clearer process for products that hold underlying commodities in regulated custody. For XRP supporters, this creates a framework in which an XRP trust can enter the market more efficiently and with greater regulatory clarity. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Price Movement Remains the Key Focus KingValeX highlighted that, beyond regulatory documents and approvals, the primary factor investors should watch is price movement. He stated, “What matters is the PRICE movement,” suggesting that market activity and investor behavior will ultimately determine XRP’s performance once trust shares begin trading. These new listing standards and the potential approval of XRP Trusts and other products are not an endpoint for the asset, but a setup for potential market action. Anticipation Builds Ahead of Launch KingValeX’s posts suggest that significant capital could flow into XRP trust shares during the early stages of trading. While he did not provide specific figures, he implied that investor attention and possible inflows could have an immediate impact on XRP’s market performance. XRP ETFs, like the Canary Capital XRPC ETF, are already seeing significant trading activity , and institutions have shown a desire to invest in regulated XRP-backed financial products. KingValeX’s perspective reinforces the idea that, from his view, price dynamics and trading activity will drive market outcomes, not regulatory filings or procedural details.

The first batch reported by the analytics company indicated that he disposed of 520 ETH, 2.62M ENA, and 132,730 ETHFI in just a few hours. Arthur Hayes( @CryptoHayes ) appears to have sold 520 $ETH ($1.66M), 2.62M $ENA ($733K), and 132,730 $ETHFI ($124K) 4 hours ago. https://t.co/loeYKUb9rN pic.twitter.com/NDEJlxGiWn — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) November 16, 2025 The team updated later that the sales continued. This time, he doubled down on ETH and ENA by offloading $820,000 worth of the former and $651,000 worth of the latter. He also sold $480,000 in LDO, $289,000 in AAVE, and $209,000 in UNI. His latest selling moves came after the most recent crypto market crash. Recall that BTC, alongside almost all altcoins, dumped hard on Friday. Bitcoin plunged to a six-month low of $94,000, while ETH dipped to $3,100. Interestingly, there’s one evident exception from the alts, which Hayes has been openly supporting for the past several weeks. Amid the rest of the altcoin calamity, ZEC is up by 26% weekly and more than 220% monthly. Hayes praised the privacy coin’s move and said it’s better than XRP on X. Recall that the Maelstrom exec sold off a significant portion of his alt holdings back in August as well. At the time, he warned that the crypto market is due for another pullback. However, that’s not what took place, as the market started to recover and he had to reaccumulate ETH at higher prices. Afterward, he “pinky” swore that he would never take a profit again.

The fast-food chain, which began taking Bitcoin in the US on May 16, 2025, has been highlighting the move as part of its public image. The company also rolled out a themed menu item called the “Bitcoin Steakburger” to mark the payment launch. Bitcoin Friendly Expansion Based on reports, the chain first hinted at a crypto push with an X post on May 9, 2025, saying a crypto option was coming soon. The payment option went live at all its US locations on May 16, 2025, and the company’s Chief Operations Officer, Dan Edwards, told reporters they aim to offer BTC at all locations worldwide. The messaging has been clear: Steak ‘n Shake wants to be known as a merchant that welcomes BTC payments.

Later, the chain reported a 15% increase in same-store sales for the third quarter. Analysts who looked at the numbers said the crypto acceptance likely helped drive the uptick, though direct cause and effect are hard to prove. The company’s third-quarter growth was compared to big names in fast food; Steak ‘n Shake outpaced McDonald’s, Burger King, Taco Bell, and Starbucks for that period, according to the report. Social Poll, Backlash, And A Reversal Steak ‘n Shake stirred a strong reaction when it asked followers whether it should add Ether as a payment option . About 48,800 people weighed in, and roughly 53% voted yes. The poll drew sharp comments from some Bitcoin supporters.

We stand with Bitcoiners. You have made your choice known. Who even suggested this? I’m back at my desk.” Community Influence On Corporate Decisions Based on reports, the reversal shows how vocal customer groups can shape business choices. Steak ‘n Shake’s quick retreat from the Ether idea suggested that it values the support of Bitcoin-focused patrons. That support appears to have helped the brand within crypto circles, and the chain’s public stance has made it a talking point among Bitcoin fans online.

Amid this delicate market, a market analyst with X username PlanD is projecting an incoming parabolic rally that hinges on the strength of a crucial support level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price In Trouble As Sell-Side Momentum Spikes — $92,000 Next? Here’s Why Bitcoin Bulls Must Preserve $94,500 Price Point – Analyst In a recent post on November 15, PlanD drew market attention to a potentially bullish situation on the BTCUSDT chart. Notably, the market expert states that Bitcoin’s price movement over the last four months has created a symmetrical expanding triangle. Following the price losses seen in the past week, Bitcoin presently trades near the lower boundary of this formation at $94,500, creating a high-stakes situation. According to PlanD, if market bulls lose this support zone, it could result in an extended market correction to around $72,000 – $73,000, suggesting a potential 24% devaluation from current market prices. On the other hand, if the price holds above $94,500, the analyst expects a price rebound to around $131,000, which corresponds to the upper resistance zone of the broadening symmetrical triangle. However, a potential volume-driven breakout from this formation amid high bullish pressure could push Bitcoin’s price to around $174,000, representing an 83% gain on present market prices. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Expands Position By 36,437 ETH – Bringing Total To $1.34B The Bullish Catalysts While staying above $94,500 is crucial to preserving Bitcoin’s bullish structure, PlanD has also listed the market factors that are important to stimulating a rally. One of these factors is expectations of a continuous reduction in interest rates by the US Federal Reserve. Following recent data that shows a weakening job market, several analysts are backing the Fed to implement another rate cut in December despite an initially hawkish tone in October. This fall in interest rate is expected to increase investor access to capital and drive up interest in risky investments, e.g, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Another catalyst mentioned by PlanD is the Bitcoin Spot ETF inflows. Notably, these products have also experienced a turbulent moment amid Bitcoin’s price troubles, with a monthly net outflow of $2.33 billion in November alone. The analyst’s theory for a bullish rebound indicates the need for an immediate reversal in these fortunes. Finally, PlanD references the ongoing progress in US regulatory clarity on digital assets as another bullish catalyst to sponsor demand and drive market price upward in the coming weeks. At press time, Bitcoin continues to trade at $95,874, reflecting a 0.46% loss in the last day.

His post revisited a long-running discussion about which networks meet the standards global institutions expect from reserve-level instruments. He highlighted XRP and XLM as the key players, noting Ripple and Stellar’s work with multinational organizations over the years. The ECB says Bitcoin isn’t fit for reserves. That’s fine. @Ripple and @StellarOrg have been working with the IMF for years. $XRP and $XLM are already building the infrastructure the world will use, and it’s happening quietly but decisively. pic.twitter.com/z3O8HRiSAQ — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) November 13, 2025 Lagarde’s Assessment and Its Relevance In the video, Lagarde addressed whether central banks should include Bitcoin in their reserves. She said reserves must be “liquid, secure, and safe” and added that they should avoid any suspicion of money laundering or criminal activity. She made her position clear when stating she is “confident that bitcoins will not enter the reserves of any of the central banks.” Her comments reflect the collective view within the ECB’s governing bodies that reserve assets must exhibit specific qualities tied to operational reliability and regulatory clarity. This distinction matters for digital assets seeking relevance in formal financial environments. The ECB did not question the broader crypto sector. However, it indicated that assets lacking predictable settlement behavior and compliance frameworks do not fit the requirements of sovereign institutions. Bitcoin’s structure does not prioritize these areas. This creates a natural separation between speculative assets and networks designed for regulated financial applications. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why the Environment Favors XRP Lagarde’s remarks align closely with the principles that have guided Ripple’s development of XRP since its early years. Ripple has consistently focused on liquidity management, institutional settlement, and cooperation with policymakers . Its work with the IMF, central banks, and financial regulators reflects an intentional strategy to meet the standards that official institutions apply to cross-border infrastructure. XLM also participates in international discussions, with its network supporting similar goals, and Aljarrah highlighted that both Ripple and Stellar have been working with the IMF for years. These ecosystems were built to address concerns tied to transparency, legitimate liquidity sourcing, and risk-managed settlement. These priorities correspond with the attributes Lagarde described when outlining what central banks expect from reserve-eligible assets. This alignment has gained even more relevance in the current policy climate. In March, the U.S. under President Donald Trump announced a strategic digital reserve that could include XRP, signaling federal willingness to support compliant digital settlement networks. If future policy develops along similar lines, XRP and XLM could receive additional clarity, integration, and institutional adoption, opening the door for crypto integration into central banks in Europe and across the globe.

The move aims to bring together non-technical users and more professional developers under one dedicated toolset. Pi App Studio New Update Pi App Studio rolled out earlier this year as the team wanted to capitalize on the growing AI adoption, which they merged with the blockchain industry. It was initially designed to help everyday users (called Pioneers) build simple apps without comprehensive coding knowledge. The new capabilities now make it a hybrid low-code platform. This means that users can export their projects, refine the code externally, such as adjusting UI elements or adding advanced functions, and then re-upload the modified version back to the Pi App Studio for further editing and deployment inside the broader Pi ecosystem. On the other hand, more advanced technical developers will be able to leverage the toolset as a rapid-prototyping environment. They can now create a quick working model within the App, export the base code, and continue full-scale development elsewhere, instead of building Pi-integrated utilities from scratch. The newly updated app can be introduced to the Pi App Studio for deployment through the simplified integration system, the team added , which should save time and streamline the entire release process. Beyond Code Functionality In addition, the team said it had implemented multiple UI and management enhancements aimed at improving the overall usability. Users will have more control over their projects, including the ability to upload preview images, share direct app links in the Fireside Forum, and even delete outdated creations following the release of a revamped management interface. The “My Apps” section now includes search, sorting filters, and a dropdown menu for renaming or managing apps. The app creation limit has been increased from 10 to 100 projects, and expanded in-app Pi allocation from 1 to 100 tokens per creator. The team said this move should encourage greater experimentation and scale. Last but not least, Pi Network’s Core Team explained that the overall design and performance upgrades have been modified to make the platform smoother, with fixes for Pi AI chatbot editing and other user-experience issues.

Why Everyone’s Talking About Mutuum Finance (MUTM),https://www.cryptopolitan.com/the-next-crypto-to-surge-550-why-everyones-talking-about-mutuum-finance-mutm/,"There is an increasing proportion of crypto buyers refocusing on a single project that is swiftly gaining momentum. Numerous individuals think that this new DeFi crypto may emerge as one of the best movers to date in 2026. The precedents, the movement, and the speed of the development are creating a wave of attention that can scarcely be ignored anymore, and now Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gets to be at the center of that discussion. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is creating a two-sided system of lending, which will be designed to provide more control, better understanding of yield, and a risk-averse approach to lending and borrowing crypto. It is based on smart contracts and designed to provide a more transparent pool compared with conventional platforms. The former half of the system is Peer-to-Contract (P2C). In this case, assets are deposited by users into a common liquidity pool. Instead, they are rewarded in terms of receiving mtTokens which are evidence of ownership of the pool. These mtTokens generate interest automatically. As an example, when one puts his or her 1 ETH in the pool, he or she is given 1 mtETH. The mtETH increases in value as borrowers begin to make withdrawals in the pool. Users are not required to move money and lock anything, but the yield will be added to their mtTokens automatically. A Peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplace is included in Mutuum Finance too. Custom terms can be requested by the borrowers and can be selected by the lenders to respond to. A rate is charged to borrowers depending on the liquidity demand. Variable borrow rates remain low when the liquidity is high. When liquidity becomes constrained, the rates increase to bring in more lenders and bring the system back to normal. Borrow positions each have LTV (Loan-to-Value) and thus users are not permitted to borrow more than the protocol specifies. In case a job has been rendered unsafe, there is a liquidation. The system applies penalties and bonuses to ensure the lenders to remain secure and not be put at a loss to the protocol. This combination of P2C and P2P gives Mutuum Finance the chance to reach the average users as well as more sophisticated lenders, a combination that many feel will provide MUTM with a long-term competitive edge. Demand, Growth and Ascending Metrics New crypto presales are among the busiest of 2025 documented by Mutuum Finance. The token went live at the beginning of 2025 with the price of $0.01. It currently is priced at $0.035 in Phase 6, 250% higher as compared to Phase 1. The project has since amassed 18.7 million dollars, 18,000 holders and already sold 800 million tokens. A total of 45.5% (or 1.82 billion tokens) of the total supply (which is 4 billion tokens) remains in the presale. Phase 6 is also changing rapidly and it is currently above 88% allocated. The 24-hour leaderboard, which gives the highest eligibility in terms of daily contribution of $500 in MUTM, is supporting the high demand. This ensures that things are kept as interesting and there is some level of competition that drives the presale. The direct sale of MUTM tokens has received another important improvement, as now new buyers can simply buy MUTM tokens using their card and without any purchase restrictions and limit, as a process will become quick and simple. V1 Launch and Security Checks One of the largest issues that make interest around MUTM to keep increasing is the upcoming V1 launch. The official post on X by Mutuum Finance states that the date of the V1 testnet launch on Sepolia will be the fourth quarter of 2025. The liquidity pool, the tokens of the debt, the liquidator bot will be presented in this version as the core components of the system. Security has also been one of the key concerns. Mutuum Finance has a CertiK audit with 90/100 Token Scan and the team has a $50,000 bug bounty on code vulnerabilities. Such measures are used to obtain trust, particularly to a new DeFi crypto that is still in progress. Access to early metrics has led analysts to believe that MUTM will be able to grow greatly upon launch, with multiple analysts labeling it as one of the best cryptos to follow. Some of them forecast a significant shift not long after the platform is launched, as evidenced by initial loan volume and the revenue strategy. Growth and What Comes Next Mutuum Finance is positioning itself as one of the most discussed new crypto projects featured of the year. Its presale is fast-moving, its community has high traction, its metrics are increasing, and its development is clearly oriented towards its V1 launch. Phase 6 demand, large holder base, and ongoing upgrades are all indications of increased confidence of the early entrants. Its dual lending concept, mtTokens, revenue based buy-and-distribute concept, stablecoin initiative, and robust audit history would suggest that MUTM may be considered one of the new DeFi crypto players joining in 2026.

Ripple’s XRP joined the list on Thursday when Canary Capital’s XRPC launched on the Nasdaq after clearing out a few hurdles. The demand for it, as well as the recently released Bitwise SOL ETF, is more than evident, especially on their respective first days of trading. The question now is which ETF is coming next? So, Who’s Next? Eric Balchunas, the senior ETF expert at Bloomberg, recently outlined the latest SEC guidance for exchange-traded fund issuers. 2025 has been the year with the most ETFs launched ever, with September and October breaking all records. Balchunas believes the new guidance will only accelerate the effectiveness of filings, aiming to clear some backlog. As such, he guessed that some of the many cryptocurrency-based ETF applications that didn’t follow Canary Capital’s path to submit an 8-A filing with the watchdog will try to do so soon. In terms of which financial vehicle will be the next to see the light of day, Balchunas noted that Bitwise’s XRP ETF should have the upper hand. SEC put out some guidance where it looks like issuers can sort of speed up the effectiveness of filings in an effort to clear out some backlog. My guess is some of those crypto etfs that didn’t do the 8a thing will try and push out as soon as they can. Bitwise XRP is due next up… pic.twitter.com/vY3ja5Xk1I — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 14, 2025 The Impressive Demand Recall that the Solana staking ETF launched by Bitwise in late October broke the first-day trading volume for the year with $56 million. However, the XRPC debut was even more impressive, with the trading volume surging to almost $60 million. Balchunas outlined this significant demand and noted that the difference with the third place is quite substantial, as its trading volume on the first day was more than $20 million lower. Congrats to $XRPC for $58m in Day One volume, the most of any ETF launched this year (out of 900), BARELY edging out $BSOL ‘s $57m.

The drop happened on Thursday across the United States as traders dumped the biggest technology names over fresh fears about stretched AI valuations, according to CNBC. Even though the Nasdaq Composite tried to claw back losses on Friday, the index is still down 3.5% for November, and the fall exposed a group of battered stock names now flashing oversold signals on the 14-day RSI screen. That screen, run on the S&P 500, highlighted companies under sharp pressure this week, ranging from cloud databases to frozen fries. Any stock with an RSI below 30 lands in oversold territory, and some of these names fell far below that line. The biggest example is Oracle, which also sells cloud infrastructure. Oracle’s RSI fell to a little over 24, one of the lowest readings on the entire index. The company’s shares dropped nearly 6% this week, leaving the name down 35% since its September 10 peak, even though it’s still up 35% for the year. The problem weighing on Oracle is the rising worry on Wall Street that Oracle is relying too much on debt to expand its AI infrastructure plan. That pressure grew strong enough that Bank of America returned to cover Oracle’s credit on Wednesday and held it at market weight while pushing for a clearer financial approach in such a heavy spending cycle. Analyst Tom Curcuruto said investors have priced in “a reasonable discount for a lengthy list of concerns that are likely to remain overhangs in the medium term,” pointing to AI rivals, big capital needs, and weak free cash flow as the main issues. Super Micro Computer loses momentum as earnings miss hits confidence Super Micro (SMCI) also landed on the oversold list this week with an RSI under 27 after the company’s shares lost 30% in November and dropped 45% from the peak it hit in February. The latest selling wave came after the firm reported a first quarter that missed expectations on both revenue and earnings, and also showed a slimmer gross profit margin. Analysts tracking SMCI through LSEG hold mixed views, with two calling it a strong buy, seven calling it a buy, and eight rating it a hold. Even so, their consensus target still points to roughly 23% upside, showing that some on Wall Street still expect improvement despite the recent damage. A one-year chart of the stock shows steep swings as traders reacted to changing growth hopes throughout the year. Palantir battles valuation fears, Burry’s attack, and a wild chart reversal Palantir became another focus after Jim Cramer reacted to comments from Carl Quintanilla about the company’s recent share move. Cramer said he wasn’t worried and described Palantir as a major player in defense and aerospace. “I can’t back away from Palantir,” Cramer said while pointing at the profit run and rapid adoption under CEO Alex Karp. Cramer said every chief executive he checked with told him Palantir changed their company “radically,” and he also argued the firm could overhaul U.S. defense systems. The stock took a hit right after earnings when it fell under $170, a move tied to a short call from Michael Burry, who clashed with Alex during that period. The name then ran back to $190 in heavy trading. The weekly chart shows a drop into an uptrend line from mid-2024 alongside the 20-week moving average, while the daily chart shows a round-trip move after the fight between Alex and Burry. The stock broke below the 20-day, 50-day, and even the weekly trend before jumping back over $190 on volume over the 50-day average. At Inside Edge, the team is holding an 8.5% stake in the fast money book and a 2% stake in the flagship growth model. They plan to add more if the name breaks into the $200 range. Traders will now wait to see if Burry repeats his real-estate short success or fails with this bearish call on the AI boom. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

He presented a simple calculation to show how quickly XRP purchases might scale if the fund experiences sustained inflows. Understanding His Breakdown Future XRP noted that the Canary XRP ETF began trading with “10,000 shares at $25 each.” He added that each share started with “10 XRP” backing, which means the creation of the fund required 100,000 XRP. He then expanded the scenario to its daily activity. He wrote that if volume reached “$57,000,000 at an average of $25/share,” it would produce more than 2 million new shares. In that scenario, he estimated that more than 20 million additional XRP would be necessary to keep the fund aligned with its initial backing level. So as I understand this, Canary seeded their XRPC spot ETF with: 10,000 shares at $25 each = $250,000 Each share backed by 10 XRP → 100,000 XRP to start. Now imagine this thing really gets moving… If today's volume hits $57,000,000 at an average of $25/share, that’s:… https://t.co/y1fBl7yxxM — Future XRP (@the5blairs) November 13, 2025 Why His Interpretation Matters His calculations highlight the structure of XRPC as a physically backed product that requires XRP to support new share creation. Investors often see this model because it ties ETF demand to purchases of the underlying asset. Future XRP’s estimates reflect the formula that a growing share count results in increased demand for the digital asset, especially if interest expands quickly. His post also raises a practical point about the scale of assets that a fund manager may need as more participants enter the market. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why This Is Positive for XRP The pace of XRP purchases comes at a time when institutional access to the asset continues to rise. XRPC now provides a regulated channel for investors who want exposure through a fund rather than managing the asset themselves. As interest in the ETF grows, all inflows require the fund manager to acquire additional XRP, which reduces the amount available on the market. If this activity accelerates, the consistent need to buy XRP in large quantities can place pressure on the circulating supply. The structure of the ETF means that expansion cannot occur without continuous purchases of XRP, which gradually removes accessible liquidity from exchanges. As the pool of available tokens tightens, sustained inflows could set the stage for a supply shock . Investors buying shares indirectly trigger real XRP acquisitions. If this process continues while supply remains limited, the market may face conditions where demand grows faster than the number of tokens available for purchase.

The agency mentioned that criminals are targeting WhatsApp, noting that they are now taking over accounts without interaction. The National Cybersecurity Center gave an update on the blogging platform X, urging Kuwaiti residents to implement specific actions and changes to protect themselves. Some of these include updating their smartphones to the latest operating systems, activating two-factor authentication ( 2FA ) across all applications, and ensuring that their social media apps are fully updated. Kuwait issues warning over hacking spree The center also urged the public to report all suspicious messages or calls to the relevant authorities. In addition, they are asked to ignore strange communications and refrain from sharing verification codes of passwords under any circumstances. The National Cybersecurity Center mentioned that it is closely monitoring developments in Kuwait and will provide further updates as new information becomes available. This information comes at a time when hackers are hacking devices to steal information and digital assets. The National Cybersecurity Center was created in 2022 and was tasked with overseeing the cybersecurity framework and implementing the national strategy. Kuwait aims at securing and protecting information networks, communication systems, and the electronic exchange of information. Ministry of Interior announces crackdown on criminals Meanwhile, the Ministry of Interior announced on Saturday that the General Department for Drug Control, in a collaborative effort with the General Administration of Customs and the Fire Force, successfully intercepted over 100 kilograms of hashish and marijuana being smuggled into the country. The ministry mentioned that the operation is part of the ongoing efforts of the Criminal Security Sector to tackle drug trafficking and prevent the endangerment of society. The ministry also explained that, based on the careful investigation carried out by the authorities, a citizen intended to travel to a neighboring country via Shuwaikh Port in his personal vehicle to transport narcotics, concealed using sophisticated methods. Based on this intelligence, a specialized team was deployed to look into the information, and after confirming, the customs led the monitoring and seizure of the vehicle upon its return. The joint operation resulted in the seizure of more than 100 kilograms of hashish and marijuana, concealed in different compartments in the vehicle. The Ministry mentioned that the suspect has been transferred to the Narcotics Prosecution Office, where he is awaiting legal action. It emphasized that the joint operation demonstrates the efficiency and readiness of security services in safeguarding the country from drugs and the criminals moving them. In a separate operation, the Ministry also said it dismantled a ring that sold and carried out illegal medical operations without a license. Authorities claim that they uncovered a network distributing government-issued medications for their profit. The police arrested four Asian nationals in connection with the illegal clinic, one that practised medicine without a license, and three others who received treatments there. In addition, three Asian nationals were apprehended in connection with distributing government-issued medications to clinics outside legal channels. Investigations uncovered a theft at a government hospital by one of the gang members, who then supplied the stolen medicine to the suspects. The police were able to round up about eight suspects involved in the criminal enterprise. The Ministry confirmed that all necessary measures will be taken against the criminals, and the seized medications will be secured.

This New Crypto Project Could Outperform Soon,https://cryptonews.com/news/missed-the-aster-price-pump-this-new-crypto-project-could-outperform-soon/,"ASTER became a popular name in September in the crypto market following its pump. The price, however, has retraced as investors take profits. Many are now searching for the next altcoin to buy, following surges from lesser-known choices like ASTER. One project that has been quietly discussed is BlockchainFX ($BFX) . The project is witnessing growing interest as more investors subscribe to its ongoing crypto presale. What makes this project unique? Let’s find out below. Many people own crypto and then set up another account with a platform to manage stocks, while also using a third account for forex. Switching between accounts can be inefficient and time-consuming. This is 2025, and innovation is moving fast. Right now, what could become one of the best cryptos to buy is approaching its launch. BlockchainFX ($BFX): The Next-Generation Altcoin to Buy for Multi-Asset Trading BlockchainFX connects decentralized finance and traditional markets. It offers more than 500 assets across cryptocurrencies, commodities, stocks, ETFs, options, and other asset classes. The goal is to redefine how people trade by letting users manage every asset class through a single decentralized system. The innovation is already gaining recognition, as BlockchainFX recently won “The Best Crypto Trading App of 2025.” Its beta version has been tested by over 20,000 users, earning strong positive feedback. The platform also offers passive income through staking. Additionally, $BFX includes a buyback and burn mechanism to help sustain long-term token value. A Major Milestone: BFX Goes Fully Licensed BlockchainFX has officially secured its international trading license from the Anjouan Offshore Finance Authority (AOFA), a milestone that instantly pushes the project into a new global tier. The license is publicly visible on BlockchainFX.com and gives $BFX the credibility, trust, and market access that fuel the 500x growth expectations around the presale. To celebrate, the team has launched the limited-time LICENSE50 bonus , giving buyers 50 percent more BFX while the offer lasts. This moment marks a serious turning point for the project and adds major momentum to what is already one of the most talked-about presales of 2025. Why BlockchainFX Is Gaining Momentum in the Crypto Presale It’s clear why many are rushing into the BlockchainFX crypto presale . Over 17,000 individuals have already purchased the $BFX token, signaling strong early demand. A token powering such a vast system could support consistent growth in both the short and long term. By connecting multiple financial industries under one decentralized structure, BlockchainFX could eventually rival top exchanges like Binance. The platform has a model that carries out burns and buybacks to maintain the health of the token. It also aims to achieve $100,000 and millions of dollars in trading volume by the end of the presale. Such momentum provides a strong base for sustainable expansion. ASTER has fallen by more than 50% from its peak price of $2.40. This is probably because it does not have the tokenomics and activities to sustain the upward move yet. BlockchainFX, however, is seeking to exploit the positive trend that exchange tokens have had over time. For context, Bitget’s BGB token surged by over 800x since launch, while newer tokens like Hyperliquid (HYPE) and Uniswap (UNI) have achieved massive adoption. With BlockchainFX combining multiple sectors, many analysts see it as a potential breakout altcoin to buy this cycle. Security, Team Experience, and Market Trust BlockchainFX has undergone multiple audits to ensure top-level safety. Reputable firms like Consult, Certik, and SolidProof have verified its codebase and infrastructure. These steps significantly reduce security risks and enhance investor trust. The BlockchainFX team comprises fintech and crypto veterans with over 25 years of combined experience in trading, blockchain, and finance. The whitepaper shows their track record of launching and scaling successful fintech and Web3 projects. Massive Rewards and Bonuses: How to Join the BlockchainFX Crypto Presale There are some advantages to joining the presale. Participants can access bonus trading credits worth up to $25,000. There are also special perks for those who invest at least $1,000 and daily rewards for all participants through staking. There is a $500,000 giveaway . This allows users to win amounts from $1,000 to $250,000 based on some specific tasks. To participate, connect a decentralized wallet such as MetaMask to the presale website. The token ($BFX) can be purchased using cryptocurrencies like ETH, BNB, XRP, SOL, and others.

By 2028, SOL is expected to reach a new high of $757.87, driven by mainstream adoption of its dApps. Solana’s price could surpass the $1,000 mark, potentially reaching $1,249.82 or higher by 2031. Despite occasional challenges for the Solana network ecosystem, including network congestion and competition from other blockchain platforms, the current sentiment shows that Solana demonstrates resilience and adaptability, despite the current price fluctuations, positioning itself as a leading player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 landscape. Overall, the prevailing sentiment regarding the current Solana price within the Solana community reflects the current sentiment of confidence and excitement among investors, driven by the growing interest in Solana with stakeholders eagerly anticipating the platform’s continued evolution and impact on the broader crypto ecosystem. While uncertainties persist, Solana’s innovative approach, along with its low transaction fees and robust infrastructure instill optimism for its future price action, as indicated by the technical factors and technical analysis. In this article, we’ll explore Solana price prediction and market dominance, particularly when evaluated against momentum indicators. This brings the question “How high can SOL go in 2025 and beyond?” and we’ll try to answer that. Overview Cryptocurrency Solana Token SOL Price $142.73 (-0.3%) Market Cap $79.06 Billion Trading Volume 24-hour $3.76 Billion Circulating Supply 554.18 Million SOL All-time High $294.33 Jan 19, 2025 All-time Low $0.5052, May 11, 2020 24-hour High $143.59 24-hour Low $137.64 Solana price prediction: Technical analysis Sentiment Bearish 50-Day SMA $191.16 200-Day SMA $180.39 Price Prediction $313.98 (119.98%) F & G Index 48.57 (fear) Green Days 21/30 (70%) 14-Day RSI 24.90 Solana price analysis: SOL falls to $142 TL;DR Breakdown: Solana price analysis shows decline back to $142 Resistance for SOL is at $160 Support for SOL/USD is at $140 The price analysis of Solana for November 15 shows that SOL has declined back to $142 as bears continue to dominate the crypto markets. Solana price analysis 1-day chart: SOL falls back to $142 Solana observed bearish pressure as SOL fell to the $180 mark before recovering back to the $200 level. However, the price faced resistance at the level and fell back to the $160 mark where it found short-term support. Now, the price has fallen to the $142 mark as higher supports crumble to the rising bearish pressure. SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 32.89, which reflects the recent trend, showing bearish pressure across the daily chart. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line steadies, suggesting declining selling pressure. Additionally, the MACD candles show bearish momentum as the indicator trades at -1.85 showing increasing bearish momentum. SOL/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls face resistance above $150 The 4-hour chart for Solana shows that the price oscillated between the $150 and the $160 levels as either side struggled to gain momentum. However, the recent rise to the $160 mark and the subsequent rejection has caused a decline, sending the price to the $142 price level where SOL finds short-term support. SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview From a technical perspective, the MACD shows rising bullish momentum at 0.09, with the indicator showing falling selling pressure as SOL finds support at $142. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) falls to around 38.78, indicating that Solana observes rising bearish momentum at the price level. The current Index level shows room for further downwards movement across the short-term. Solana technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 166.03 SELL SMA 5 $ 166.12 SELL SMA 10 $ 162.26 SELL SMA 21 $ 172.68 SELL SMA 50 $ 190.18 SELL SMA 100 $ 199.12 SELL SMA 200 $ 175.07 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 175.68 SELL EMA 5 $ 185.27 SELL EMA 10 $ 194.72 SELL EMA 21 $ 196.52 SELL EMA 50 $ 188.71 SELL EMA 100 $ 178.66 SELL EMA 200 $ 171.94 SELL What to expect from Solana price analysis? SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview The Solana price analysis across the daily and 1-hour chart indicates support around $140 with next support at $136. The chart suggests that further downwards movement is unlikely across the short-term. As the price struggles below $160, SOL can be expected to hold above the $140 level and consolidate before triggering a significant trend. However, if the price fails to break the critical $160 level, SOL may fall below the $140 support, extending the bearish trend. Is SOL a good investment? Solana is a high-performance blockchain platform known for its robust scalability and speed due to various technological advancements, particularly in the crypto space boasting a substantial Total Value Locked ( TVL ). The network continues to hit key development milestones. Despite a challenging month, price predictions indicate a more positive outlook, suggesting the potential for Solana’s growth and future growth. Why is SOL down? Solana observed a rejection at the $160 mark which resulted in a crash to the current $142 support. Broader bearish market sentiment continues to dominate Solana markets. What is Solana going to be worth in 2025? The Solana (SOL) price prediction for 2025 suggests a minimum value of $150.06 with an average price of 331.81, driven by fundamental factors in the market. The price could reach a maximum of $367.80 during the year. Will SOL reach $1,000? The price forecasts indicate that SOL could reach the $1000 mark by 2030, influenced by trends in the broader crypto market . Given the bullish scenario and the projected positive market sentiment and growth trend, SOL might reach $1,000 within the next five years. Can Solana reach $5,000? Reaching $5,000 is plausible but would likely take several years beyond the current forecast period. However, a snowball in the asset’s adoption might bring the moment sooner. Does SOL have a good long-term future? Yes, Solana has a good long-term future, with a promising market capitalization and exciting potential ROI due to its high scalability, which makes Solana an attractive investment. Its growing adoption, strong developer community, and strategic partnerships further enhance Solana’s forecast of its potential for sustained growth.

However, it is advised to do your own research and conduct expert opinion before investing in the volatile crypto market. Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level, a trend that could not extend through June as the month saw a decline falling below the $150 price level to end the month. July saw a sharp rise to the asset’s volatility with SOL crossing the $200 mark. However, the price could not be maintained and SOL ended the month below the $180 level. In August, on the other hand, SOL made strides and managed to close the month above the $205 mark. In September, the volatility rose sharply as the price rose to the $250 price level but failed to maintain the level and ended the month at $230. In October, the decline increased sharply as SOL ended the month below $170.",Crypto Price Predictions|Solana,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-16 08:30:00

Gensler Even Wanted to Designate Bitcoin as a Security In a conversation with Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) about two weeks before the FTX crash, Adams suggested that then-SEC Chairman Gary Gensler was preparing to classify all major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, as “securities.” Adams stated on social media that the SBF had asked him to support a bill that would “destroy” the crypto industry, but he had refused. Sharing details of the meeting, Adams said the SBF is in close contact with the SEC and that the institution wants to establish full authority over the crypto market. Related News: What Caused the Recent Drop in Bitcoin Prices, and What Should We Expect Next? Here Are Expert Opinions and Data According to Adams' statement, the SEC was considering designating not only Ethereum but even Bitcoin as a security. He also stated that the plan was for FTX to obtain a sole brokerage license in exchange for the regulations, while an institution FTX partners with would have a sole exchange license. In such a scenario, crypto trading in the US would only be legally conducted through FTX. “The SBF didn't put it that way, but they did say they were in very deep discussions with the SEC, and that the agency wanted jurisdiction over ETH and BTC,” Adams said. He also added that the SBF was quite tense during the meeting. Adams stated that the plan in question completely fell apart with the collapse of FTX, and commented, “Ironically, the collapse of FTX may have saved the industry.” *This is not investment advice.

Well, the answer is a resounding yes, especially as institutional capital increasingly flows into crypto, paired with clearer regulatory frameworks. Recent data indicate that more than half of global hedge funds now hold cryptocurrency positions, reflecting a marked shift in how mainstream finance perceives digital assets. Investors are no longer viewing meme coins as mere speculation; instead, they are being analyzed for utility, community strength, and growth potential. In this evolving world, tokens that were once purely playful are now drawing serious attention, particularly those with structured presales, staking mechanisms, and active community governance. Official Trump, Turbo, and BullZilla exemplify this trend. Amid this backdrop, BullZilla ($BZIL) stands out as a token with a unique value proposition, often hailed as the “ best 100x meme coin of the month .” Its presale performance has captured the market’s attention, demonstrating strong demand, early ROI potential, and robust tokenomics. BullZilla’s combination of staking benefits, referral incentives, and structured burn mechanisms gives it an edge over competitors like Official Trump and Turbo. For example, early investors in BullZilla have already seen significant returns, reinforcing confidence in its long-term trajectory.

Official Trump ($TRUMP): The Patriotic Meme Coin Making Waves The token labelled Official Trump (TRUMP) rides a uniquely themed meme‑coin wave with political branding and community momentum. Over the last 24 hours, its reported trading volume stands at $947,126,898, representing a ‑43.20 % decrease from one day ago and signalling a recent fall in market activity. Its all‑time high price recorded was $73.43, while its all‐time low sat at $4.29. TRUMP currently trades about 89.09 % below its peak and is about 86.71 % above its lowest price.

Its fully diluted valuation (FDV) is around $8,013,653,261, assuming a maximum supply of 1 billion tokens. Frequently Asked Questions About Official Trump What drives Official Trump’s correlations with political events? Official Trump’s value often rises or falls in line with media coverage, political branding, and social media momentum rather than traditional utility. This means regulatory shifts or headline news can affect price dramatically. Is Official Trump considered high risk compared to utility tokens? Given its meme-coin nature, Official Trump (TRUMP) exhibits high volatility, minimal intrinsic utility, and depends heavily on community sentiment, making it a speculative investment that requires caution and careful risk management.

It walks through wallet connection, token purchase, vesting schedule, and security protocols. The process demands caution: verifying the correct contract address, using trusted wallets, and confirming the project’s vetted roadmap. Investing at the presale stage offers potential for outsized returns given the low entry price and token scarcity. Nevertheless, it also embodies higher risk, including smart‑contract vulnerability, listing uncertainty, and token‑lock conditions. Importantly, the narrative positions BullZilla as a “meme coin with structuring”, aiming to move beyond pure hype. Frequently Asked Questions About BullZilla Presale What is the staking benefit for BullZilla token holders? Investing $2,500 in the BullZilla ($BZIL) presale balances ambition and prudence, offering potential growth, financial flexibility, and long-term rewards. It’s a smart move that builds confidence, opportunity, and strategic wealth accumulation. Why might presale tokens not appear in a wallet immediately? Presale tokens are usually held in escrow until listing or vesting starts, meaning they might not appear in a regular wallet immediately. Visibility only occurs once the project’s release or distribution conditions are met. How do potential investors spot fake Telegram channels about the presale? Investors should verify official channel handles, cross-check links on the project’s website, confirm token contract addresses on blockchain explorers, and avoid unsolicited messages or links claiming guaranteed returns to prevent scams and ensure safety. Turbo ($TURBO): Accelerating Through the Crypto Fast Lane Turning to the third contender, Turbo (TURBO), this token offers a different profile. In the last 24 hours, its trading volume reached approximately $15,452,265, reflecting a ‑9.90 % decrease from one day ago and indicating reduced immediate market activity. TURBO’s all‑time high stands at $0.01432, while its all‐time low was $0.00006518. It currently trades about 85.93 % below its peak but is a striking 2,989.85 % above its lowest price. Market capitalisation is reported at $139,108,002, ranked #397 on CoinGecko today, with a fully diluted valuation (FDV) equal to the same figure given the circulating supply of 69 billion tokens. Frequently Asked Questions About Turbo What makes Turbo’s recent performance notable? Turbo (TURBO) surged 14.80% over the past week, outperforming many peers. This strong momentum highlights growing interest from speculative traders and signals potential for further short-term gains in high-beta token markets. Is Turbo considered a utility token or more speculative? Turbo (TURBO) remains highly speculative, with minimal documented utility. Its value largely depends on market sentiment, token supply dynamics, and hype, rather than on established use-cases or a fully developed ecosystem. Conclusion The recent milestone of institutional adoption, with over half of hedge funds now holding crypto, signals that mainstream capital is increasingly entering the market as regulatory frameworks gain clarity. This shift sets a favorable stage for emerging tokens like BullZilla ($BZIL), Official Trump (TRUMP), and Turbo (TURBO), each offering unique narratives. Among them, BullZilla captures attention with its structured presale, staking mechanisms, and token-burn strategy, creating both scarcity and community-driven momentum.

He added that they will be moving ad recommendations onto the same AI system that already optimizes organic posts for users’ interests. Earlier this month, in an X space session, Musk had hinted he intends to turn X into the top advertising platform globally, using Grok, which he described as the “smartest in the world” based on benchmark scores. X organic posts are still stagnating at pre-acquisition figures In a Sunday X post , Musk confirmed, “You should notice rapid improvements in the quality of your timeline almost every week, but there will be two steps forward and one step back at times. We are also switching advertising recommendations to use the same Grok/AI system as organic posts, so the quality of ads will get radically better.” In Musk’s view, Grok is a big leap from what he described as Twitter’s old “somewhat random” in its ad targeting. However, since the Tesla founder took over the platform, concerns over brand safety have become a key factor in why advertisers left, amid looser ad placement policies and public disputes with critics. Some advertisers rejoined X following the 2024 election, but revenue still lags behind pre-acquisition figures. X recorded around 100 million original posts per day in 2023, and current activity levels still hover near that mark, hinting at some stagnation. Nonetheless, Musk hopes that smarter AI-driven targeting and safer ad placements will improve the platform. In an earlier update, the billionaire stated that he planned to launch a system that scans posts , replies, quotes, and reposts to predict what each user is interested in. Back then. Musk noted that the shift was a fix for lesser-known creators whose high-quality posts don’t get traction, promising that AI will bring worthy content to the surface, independent of follower numbers. He explained users will be able to ask Grok to modify their feed preferences at any time, for a brief adjustment or a lasting one. Ideally, the new system would help surface posts from small creators to the right audiences and enhance overall engagement. But for users who browse a hand-picked, chronological timeline, the impact might go unnoticed. So far, X has already restricted emoji use and banned hashtags in ads, and introduced an “aesthetic score” that lowers costs for well-designed creatives. However, critics have questioned the aesthetic score, suggesting it may be influenced more by Musk’s personal preference than by proven metrics. AI transforms ads and monetization on X X is also rolling out AI-powered Dynamic Product Ads that surface products relevant to individual users. Musk is also looking to integrate ads into Grok chatbot answers, based on user queries. In the future, campaigns might run entirely under Grok’s management after advertisers upload their creative assets. By deploying Grok’s AI, X can deliver hyper-targeted campaigns to advertisers, as well as support smaller creators with access to specialized audiences, potentially revolutionizing the way engagement and monetization operate across the platform.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/zack-rector-canary-will-need-to-buy-a-lot-more-xrp-after-today-heres-why/,"Interest in Canary Capital’s new XRPC exchange-traded fund grew quickly after its debut, and commentary from market participants added another layer of focus. Zach Rector, a prominent figure in the crypto space, has drawn attention to the potential impact of the fund on XRP’s supply, stating, “Canary will need to buy a lot more XRP after today!” Canary will need to buy a lot more XRP after today! pic.twitter.com/qnQOh0A1Cg — Zach Rector (@ZachRector7) November 13, 2025 Early Structure and Initial Backing The ETF entered the market with a seed creation of 10,000 shares priced at $25 per share. The 250,000 dollars in seed capital funded the purchase of XRP, and the price of XRP sat around $2.39 to $2.5 at that point. These figures brought initial backing of roughly 100,000 XRP for the entire fund, translating to about 10 XRP per share. This setup reflected the sponsor’s intention to maintain physical support for the product rather than synthetic or futures-based exposure . The creation unit for the ETF includes 40,000 shares. Authorized participants follow the procedures set out in the fund’s documentation when they create or redeem units. Each creation or redemption requires the delivery of XRP proportional to the needed basket. Supply Reduction and ETF Purchases A physically backed ETF removes XRP from active markets whenever authorized participants create new units. While the tokens the fund holds remain in custody, the shares exist. So, increased creation activity increases demand for XRP , lowering the supply available for retail users and other purposes. That reduction compounds an existing trend. Exchange wallets have shown lower XRP balances in recent months , and an ETF that sources actual tokens for collateral can accelerate that decline if inflows continue. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 When investors place capital into the ETF, market makers and authorized participants must secure the appropriate XRP basket before delivering creation units. In practice, this increases spot demand. The purchases do not immediately reenter circulation, so the net effect tightens the circulating supply. A tighter circulating supply can change market dynamics because it reduces the amount of XRP available to meet buy-side pressure from other market participants. Price Effects to Watch Reduced exchange inventories and ETF-driven purchases can create conditions that support upward price movement if buying pressure persists. Price responds to both demand and available supply. When supply decreases and demand remains steady or increases, buyers may need to bid higher to acquire tokens, which can raise market prices as exchanges run out of tokens . The magnitude of any price response depends on flow size, frequency of creations, and overall market liquidity.

According to analysis by Ali Martinez, Bitcoin has broken below a key ascending channel, a structure that had supported price action throughout previous months. The breakdown is significant because it signals a shift in momentum from consolidation to a more pronounced bearish trend. In an X post on November 16, the analyst noted that this move “opens the door to a drop toward $83,500,” marking one of the most bearish near-term projections since the recent market correction began. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView After failing to reclaim the $100,500 support zone, Bitcoin continued forming lower highs and lower lows, pointing to a weakening market structure. The analysis outlined a likely brief consolidation between $95,000 and $97,000 before the downtrend resumes. At the same time, the projection highlighted two stages: an initial retest of the mid-$90,000 area, followed by a deeper slide through support levels at $91,500, $89,000, and $86,500. If these levels fail, a move toward $83,000 becomes increasingly likely. Bitcoin hits Extreme Fear Notably, the bearish outlook comes as the crypto market remains deep in risk-off territory, with the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index plunging to 10 firmly in Extreme Fear . The reading has held steady, highlighting a month-long deterioration in sentiment; just a week ago, the index sat at 22 and already signaled heightened caution. Crypto Fear & Greed Index. Source: Alternative.me This prolonged slump suggests traders are increasingly anxious amid volatility and broader economic uncertainty. Extreme fear reflects intensified selling pressure and a retreat by many market participants. Historically, similar lows have often aligned with market bottoms as panic peaks and weaker hands exit. For prices, this environment points to a market nearing a psychological breaking point. While extreme fear may fuel further short-term weakness as traders avoid new positions, such sentiment troughs have also marked moments when long-term investors begin accumulating assets viewed as undervalued. Though sentiment alone doesn’t dictate price action, a reading this low highlights an emotionally stretched market that may be poised for a significant shift once confidence returns. Bitcoin price analysis By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $95,973, having gained a modest 0.13% in the past 24 hours, while on the weekly timeline the asset has plunged about 6%. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold At the current price, Bitcoin sits well below its 50-day SMA of $111,417 and 200-day SMA of $105,695, placing it firmly beneath major trend indicators and reinforcing a clear bearish posture. Such a wide gap between spot price and these moving averages typically signals fading momentum and a market struggling to regain upward direction. The 14-day RSI at 31.23 adds further context. While not yet oversold, it is hovering just above that level, indicating sellers have dominated but that downside pressure may be nearing exhaustion.

The downturn triggered a wave of bearish predictions. However, some analysts are not convinced a deeper decline is on the cards, and that markets could see a recovery next week. Michael Saylor Denies Strategy Plans To Dump Bitcoin (BTC) Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor has denied reports that the company is planning to offload some of its Bitcoin holdings amid a substantial decline in the asset’s price. Saylor took to X to clarify that there was “no truth” to reports claiming Strategy has reduced its overall holdings by approximately 47,000 BTC , worth nearly $4.6 billion. Saylor added that Strategy plans to continue to buy Bitcoin as the price fell almost 5% over 24 hours to a low of $93,951 on Friday. Saylor stated, “I think the volatility comes with the territory. If you’re going to be a Bitcoin investor, you need a four-year time horizon and you need to be prepared to handle the volatility in this market.” Bitcoin ETFs Record Their Second-Worst Day On Record Spot Bitcoin ETFs registered $866 million in net outflows on Thursday, making it their second-worst day on record after the $1.14 billion in outflows on February 25. Thursday’s outflows occurred after President Trump signed a government funding bill to keep the government operational until January 30, 2026. A slowdown in ETF demand has caused concern among crypto investors. ETFs were key drivers of Bitcoin’s stunning rally past $125,000. Ki Young Ju, founder and CEO of crypto intelligence platform CryptoQuant, believes Bitcoin’s bull market will remain intact as long as the price does not fall below $94,000. “Personally, I do not think the bear cycle is confirmed unless we lose that level. I would rather wait than jump to conclusions.” However, some analysts have argued that the four-year cycle theory is no longer relevant after the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley stated, “Since the launch of the Bitcoin ETFs and the new administration, we’ve entered a new market structure. I think there’s a pretty good chance that we’ve been in a bear market for almost 6 months now and are almost through it. The setup for crypto right now has never been stronger.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin ( BTC ) crashed to a six-month low on Friday, falling to $93,951. However, the weekend has seen a marginal recovery, with the price rising 1.10% on Saturday and settling at $95,544. The flagship cryptocurrency is marginally up during the ongoing session, trading around $95,992. Analysts believe that prices will not go lower after BTC bounced back after Friday’s low. Crypto analyst YazanXBT believes that the flagship cryptocurrency is gearing up for a move to $145,000 rather than dropping to $92,000 or lower. The analyst highlighted similar moments during the market’s previous bottom, adding that traders were certain prices could fall as low as $10,000. Instead, prices bottomed around $16,000 before staging one of the strongest recoveries on record. However, one community member argued that BTC has an unfulfilled CME gap at $92,000, noting that historically, BTC tends to fill CME gaps before surging to new highs, suggesting a crash was imminent. However, YazanXBT dismissed the outlook, reiterating that the flagship cryptocurrency will rally rather than crash. BTC started the previous weekend in positive territory, rising 1.97% on Friday and settling at $103,284. Price action was mixed over the weekend as BTC fell 0.97% on Saturday before rising 2.36% on Sunday and settling at $104,964. Buyers retained control on Monday as the price rose 1.23% and settled at $105,979. Buyers lost momentum on Tuesday as BTC fell nearly 3% and settled at $103,009. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as the flagship cryptocurrency fell 1.33% to $101,639. Source: TradingView BTC registered a sharp uptick in volatility and selling pressure on Thursday. As a result, the price fell below $100,000 for the first time since June, dropping to a low of $97,870 before settling at $99,614. Selling pressure intensified on Friday as BTC plunged to a low of $93,951 before settling at $94,503, ultimately dropping over 5%. The price recovered on Saturday, rising over 1% to $95,944.

54476377,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=861493,1763285400,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/54476377.jpeg,Could Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Be the Next Big Crypto in 2026? Here’s What Investors Are Saying,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/could-mutuum-finance-mutm-be-the-next-big-crypto-in-2026-heres-what-investors-are-saying/,"More and more early investors are giving notice to a fresh crypto initiative that has been gaining momentum behind the scenes during the year 2025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in presale but its blistering development and steady increase in demand are beginning to pose a straightforward query: could this be among the finest crypto platforms one will go into in the year 2026? Lots of people think that the indications are heading that way. Mutuum Finance Records Since it has started its presale, Mutuum Finance has demonstrated stable traction. The token was released at the beginning of 2025 and currently features a price of $0.035 in the Stage 6. The increase in that climb is 2.5x of the level at which it started. First time presale has already raised over $18.7 million and over 18,000 holders are now on board. Out of the total supply of 4 billion, 45.5% is allocated to the presale and that is approximately 1.82 billion tokens. Phase 6 out of that allocation is more than 88%. This is viewed by many buyers as an indicator of the increasing interest before the next price stage. The fact that the token comes along with a price of its launch confirmed at $0.06 gives another point of focus as the token can go higher. This project also improved its payment platform, where people got to purchase MUTM using a card and without having restrictions on purchases. This has enabled the presale to be available to new consumers as well as the entrants into the market in large volumes. The Future of Money at Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance intends to establish a DeFi crypto ecosystem that is based on lending, borrowing and yield generation. The team is creating a two-lending structure instead of financial institutions operating under one model and one type of operations that would suit different types of users. The system runs a core on the basis of the mtTokens. Whenever one deposits their assets, they are given a receipt in the form of mtTokens which appreciates in value as the interest accumulates. The token grows in real time according to the activity within the liquidity pool. To a lot of investors, such a simple design is among the most obvious indicators of the actual usefulness in a new cryptocurrency. A buy and distribute system is also employed by Mutuum Finance. Part of the revenues generated by lending operations is utilized in acquiring MUTM in the market. These tokens are then delivered to users that stake mtTokens in the safety module. This cycle forms natural token demand which is bound to protocol activity and not hype. Security is one more sphere that the team has focused on. Mutuum Finance successfully completed a CertiK audit with a 90/100 Token Scan rating and has a 50,000 dollar bug bounty on code bugs. This has contributed to gaining the trust since the presale continues to expand. Stablecoin Plans, Oracle Systems and Analyst Outlook As a later-stage roadmap event, Mutuum Finance will roll out its own stablecoin. The stablecoin will be minted and burned on-demand and is geared towards activity within the protocol. This additional layer is why a great number of investors consider MUTM as an opportunity that can grow to be more than a mere lending platform. The protocol will also be based on the strong oracle systems to maintain the price data correct. This is significant in the liquidations, interest adjustments and general stability. The team has emphasized on the intention to utilize proven feeds in order to limit risk during rapid market movements. Other analysts are optimistic that MUTM would experience massive growth after the launch of the central product. Using the presale price of $0.035 and the launch price of $0.06, some of the initial supporters believe that the price could potentially increase up to 3x to 5x in 2026 should lending be increased and users can be attracted at the same pace. As the primary causes of such perspective, they indicate the dual revenue model and the plans of stablecoin. V1 Launch, Momentum Phase 6 and Whale Interest The official announcement on X implies that the V1 testnet will be operating on the Sepolia network in Q4 2025. Liquidity pool, mtTokens, debt tokens and the liquidator bot will be some of the main features introduced in the first version. This is when Mutuum Finance shifts to post sale hype to actual utility of the product. Now that Phase 6 is well underway to completion, the appearance of larger buyers is coming to view. The whale entries have also been rising during the past few weeks and multiple high value purchases have been registered during some of the most active presale times. A good number of these buyers are now setting positioning before the last sequence is started. The 24 hour leader board is also contributing to daily activity rewarding the best contributor 500 dollars worth of MUTM. This combination of increased demand, increased movement of whales and an actual launch schedule has sent Mutuum Finance to the conversation of those who are seeking the next new crypto with big potential. The upward momentum is also indicative of why Mutuum Finance is one of the best crypto projects to follow into 2026, even though the market still waits to see the development of the said project in the last few months.

Key Takeaways: The DOJ is seeking to seize over $15 million in USDT tied to North Korean hacking group APT38. The funds were traced to four major 2023 crypto platform breaches and were first seized by the FBI in March 2025. Five individuals in the US also pleaded guilty to aiding North Korean IT workers in infiltrating American companies. The action, announced Friday, includes two civil forfeiture complaints covering $15.1 million in Tether stolen during a series of 2023 attacks attributed to North Korea’s Advanced Persistent Threat 38 (APT38), a state-backed hacking unit known for targeting global crypto firms. FBI Seeks to Forfeit Seized USDT Tied to 2023 Crypto Hacks Federal investigators traced the digital assets to funds stolen from four virtual currency platforms in 2023. The FBI initially seized the USDT in March 2025 and is now seeking court approval to permanently forfeit the assets so they can be returned to victims. The DOJ did not identify the specific hacked platforms, though its timeline aligns closely with several major incidents that year, including the $100 million Poloniex breach in November 2023, the $37 million CoinsPaid hack that July, the Alphapo payments attack , which the DOJ estimates at approximately $100 million, and another November 2023 theft of about $138 million from a Panama-based exchange. The DOJ has not confirmed which of these cases fall under the forfeiture actions. According to the announcement, North Korean operatives continued to launder stolen funds through a patchwork of mixers, cross-chain bridges, crypto exchanges, and OTC brokers. “Efforts to trace, seize, and forfeit related stolen virtual currency remain ongoing, as the APT38 actors continue to launder such funds,” the DOJ said.

KOREA-LINKED CRYPTO The Justice Department recovered another $15M from North Korean crypto heists as its crackdown intensifies. pic.twitter.com/udWxTRNd9T — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) November 15, 2025 The enforcement push doesn’t stop at the hackers. The DOJ also revealed it secured guilty pleas from five individuals who helped North Korea infiltrate US companies through fraudulent remote IT work, a scheme that has become a central revenue stream for Pyongyang. Four US citizens, including Audricus Phagnasay (24), Jason Salazar (30), Alexander Paul Travis (34), and Erick Ntekereze Prince (38), admitted to wire fraud conspiracy after providing their identities to North Korean IT workers and allowing company-issued laptops to be operated from inside their homes. The setup was designed to make it appear these workers were based in the United States, giving them access to US corporate networks. Ukrainian Pleads Guilty to Selling Stolen U.S. Identities to North Korea In a separate plea, Ukrainian national Oleksandr Didenko admitted to wire fraud conspiracy and aggravated identity theft. He stole US citizens’ identities and sold them to North Korean IT operatives, helping them secure roles at 40 companies. Didenko agreed to forfeit more than $1.4 million. In total, the schemes touched 136 US companies, generated more than $2.2 million for the North Korean government, and compromised over 18 Americans’ identities. Officials have repeatedly warned that North Korean IT workers can earn up to $300,000 per year, collectively funneling hundreds of millions of dollars into programs overseen by the regime’s Ministry of Defense. North Korea’s crypto theft operations have surged in 2025 , with hackers stealing more than $2 billion so far this year, according to blockchain analytics firm Elliptic.

Key Takeaways: Steak ‘n Shake is expanding into El Salvador after becoming one of the most prominent US fast-food chains to adopt Bitcoin payments. The company attributes an 11% Q2 sales boost and a 15% Q3 jump to its Bitcoin integration. A brief attempt to consider ETH payments sparked backlash, prompting the chain to reaffirm its allegiance to Bitcoin users. The company announced the move on Saturday after participating in the Bitcoin Histórico event held in San Salvador earlier in the week. “We were honored to be in Bitcoin Country,” the company wrote on X , signaling deeper involvement in the nation’s crypto-driven economy. Steak ‘n Shake’s Bitcoin Push Drives 11% Surge in Q2 Sales The expansion follows Steak ‘n Shake’s decision in May to begin accepting Bitcoin across its US stores. So far, the strategy appears to be paying off. Steak ‘n Shake credited nearly an 11% jump in same-store sales in Q2 to its Bitcoin payments rollout, positioning the brand as one of the most visible corporate adopters of the asset. Its embrace of Bitcoin has cemented the chain as a recognizable player within the crypto community, highlighting a growing trend of merchants integrating BTC for everyday purchases. Advocates argue that real-world, low-value transactions are essential stepping stones toward broader adoption. However, the company briefly stirred controversy in October after polling its followers on whether it should also accept Ether (ETH).

The beginning of a beautiful friendship https://t.co/VIyzL9OT3M — Steak 'n Shake (@SteaknShake) November 15, 2025 Of the 48,815 votes cast, 53% supported the idea, triggering immediate backlash from Bitcoin maximalists. “ETH is centralized garbage. Bitcoin is freedom,” one user wrote, warning the chain against expanding beyond BTC. Within hours, Steak ‘n Shake reversed course. “Poll suspended. Our allegiance is with Bitcoiners… Who even allowed this?” the company posted on X on the same day the poll launched. Despite the brief stumble, Steak ‘n Shake continued its strong financial performance into Q3, reporting a 15% quarter-over-quarter increase in same-store sales. The company outpaced McDonald’s, Burger King, Taco Bell, and Starbucks, marking one of the most impressive growth runs in the fast-food sector. Steak ‘n Shake Launches Bitcoin Treasury, Donates Sats Earlier this month, Steak ‘n Shake launched a Bitcoin treasury , committing to store all BTC received from customer payments in a dedicated reserve. The company announced the initiative on X, calling it the next step in strengthening its long-term Bitcoin strategy. As part of the rollout, Steak ‘n Shake will donate 210 satoshis for every “Bitcoin Meal” sold, with funds directed to OpenSats to support Bitcoin Core and open-source development. The company is expanding its engagement further through a partnership with Bitcoin rewards app Fold. Customers who buy a “Bitcoin Meal” or “Bitcoin Steakburger” will receive $5 in BTC, redeemable through Fold. The promotion, available across 400 US locations, aims to introduce Bitcoin to everyday consumers.

Key Takeaways: Chinese money laundering networks are increasingly using Bitcoin and USDT to bypass strict capital controls. The same networks now serve Western criminal groups, including the fentanyl supply chain. Researchers warn that crypto-enabled laundering has become so globalized that no single jurisdiction can tackle the problem alone. A paper published this month by Kathryn Westmore , a senior research fellow at the Centre for Finance and Security at the Royal United Services Institute, argues that cryptocurrencies have become a central pillar of China’s underground financial system. Chinese Laundering Networks Turn to Crypto to Evade Capital Controls Westmore said Chinese Money Laundering Organisations (CMLOs) are now routinely using virtual assets as conduits for illicit cash. “Increasingly, [CMLOs] are incorporating cryptocurrencies within their operations, providing criminals with virtual assets, such as Bitcoin, or stablecoins, such as Tether USDT, in return for their dirty cash,” she wrote. These digital assets then serve as a tool for individuals to quietly shift wealth offshore, bypassing strict capital controls that limit the movement of funds out of the country. The shift comes amid a broader surge in crypto-related crime. Investor losses surpassed $2.3 billion in 2025, while pig-butchering scams drained $4 billion from victims in 2024, according to Chainalysis. Westmore’s research adds another dimension to that landscape, showing that Chinese laundering groups have also become crucial financial intermediaries for Western criminal operations, including the fentanyl supply chain. The report describes how drug proceeds collected in the United States are converted into Bitcoin or USDT, then routed to offshore accounts belonging to wealthy Chinese clients seeking discreet channels to move funds abroad. NEW EPISODE IS LIVE. WE FOUND $500,000,000 IN CRYPTO PAYMENTS AND MONEY LAUNDERING. pic.twitter.com/p9NDjwaAYx — Coffeezilla (@coffeebreak_YT) June 9, 2023 The use of crypto extends beyond laundering services. Many Chinese sellers of fentanyl precursor chemicals now accept Bitcoin and USDT directly, effectively turning digital assets into settlement infrastructure for the synthetic opioid trade. Blockchain analytics firm Elliptic has corroborated these claims, documenting onchain payments to China-based chemical suppliers tied to global fentanyl distribution networks. With crypto rails woven deeply into these transnational laundering systems, Westmore warns that the problem is too vast for any single government to handle. Europol Busts Ring Behind 49 Million Fake Accounts Tied to Crypto In October, Europol dismantled a sophisticated cybercrime syndicate accused of creating more than 49 million fake online accounts, including fraudulent profiles linked to major cryptocurrency platforms. The operation, codenamed “SIMCARTEL,” uncovered a sophisticated SIM farm-for-hire network that sold temporary mobile numbers used to bypass two-factor authentication, allowing criminals to mass-produce fake identities and commit large-scale financial fraud. According to Europol, the syndicate’s infrastructure supported account creation for a range of online services, from e-commerce sites to digital banks and crypto exchanges. These fake accounts were then used to launder illicit funds, run phishing campaigns, and facilitate smishing scams targeting European users.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out because its presale structure has clearly defined phases that rise from $0.01 to $0.06, a 600% value increase. Combined with projected lending and borrowing utilities and a continuous token-buyback system, the project will offer tangible catalysts for 2025. Traders who position during the ongoing Phase 6 will benefit from the next automatic step in pricing. The rising demand, structured presale, and active on-chain features make Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a compelling choice for those pursuing short-term growth. The visible price progression and ecosystem mechanics provide a quantifiable edge compared to other new crypto coin options. What Is Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Dual Lending Foundation as a Demand Engine Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will have a total supply of 4B tokens distributed in 11 Presale Phases. Across all presale phases, the project has raised approximately $18.65 million with more than 18,000 holders having participated across all phases. Phase 6 is priced at $0.035 and about 90% sold of the 170 million token allocation. The final Phase 11 price will reach $0.06, completing the built-in 600% phase-to-phase progression. This stepwise structure ensures a clear trajectory and urgency for traders to acquire tokens before each threshold. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will operate with two complementary lending systems designed to circulate liquidity continuously. Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pools will allow users to supply stablecoins or major assets into audited smart contracts. Interest rates will adjust automatically according to pool utilization, keeping lending appealing and borrowing sustainable. Depositors will receive mtTokens that track their share and yield, which will also be used for staking or as collateral in the ecosystem. The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) channels will allow lenders and borrowers to negotiate customized loans for higher-volatility assets. These loans will remain isolated from pooled liquidity, preserving stability while offering targeted earning opportunities. The dual system will create constant transaction throughput and intrinsic MUTM demand, ensuring continuous activity inside the platform. Stablecoin Innovation Creates Continuous Usage Post Launch Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will introduce a decentralized stablecoin to anchor liquidity. Users will borrow against collateral such as ETH, and the stablecoin will be burned once loans are repaid or liquidated. Only approved issuers will mint, each within a set cap to maintain controlled circulation. Borrow rates will be governed dynamically to maintain the $1 peg. Rates will rise if the stablecoin trades below $1 and fall if it trades above $1. Arbitrage participants will naturally stabilize deviations. This stablecoin will form the transactional heart of the platform, continuously locking liquidity and encouraging repeated usage, which will support constant MUTM demand and ecosystem growth. Price Discovery Through Oracles & Exchange Listing Reliable asset pricing will be achieved through Chainlink feeds, supported by fallback oracles, aggregated feeds, and on-chain DEX TWAPs. This multi-layered approach will prevent erroneous liquidations, reduce risk, and create confidence among larger participants. Greater confidence will allow higher loan volumes, generate more protocol revenue, and feed back into MUTM buybacks and mtToken staking rewards. This will create a self-reinforcing cycle of growth and platform activity. As Mutuum Finance (MUTM) completes presale phases and launches its protocol, exchange attention will rise expectedly. Early adoption of borrowing and staking utilities will generate user activity from day one. A future listing on major exchanges will increase visibility, trading volume, and overall market awareness. Combined with presale gains, this will amplify MUTM exposure, making it an attractive candidate for investors looking for a new crypto coin with structured short-term upside. Conclusion: Act Before the Next Presale Step Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already undergone a CertiK audit using manual review and static analysis. Token Scan Score stands at 90.00, and Skynet Score 79.00. The audit timeline runs from February 25, 2025, to May 20, 2025. A 50,000 USDT bug bounty pool will reward ethical hackers, tiered from $2,000 for critical issues to $200 for low-severity findings. This framework will reinforce confidence among traders and institutional partners, demonstrating the platform’s commitment to robust security. Phase 6 of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be 90% sold, with the automatic price increase to $0.040 approaching. Subsequent phases will continue toward the Phase 11 cap of $0.06, representing a 600% built-in progression. For those investing in crypto, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a clear, stepwise path to gains that few other presales provide.

Baron argued that investors should see the bigger picture and seize opportunities rather than focusing on short-term dips. Ron Baron noted that the market has recently been largely focused on technology and artificial intelligence stocks. He noted that companies outside these areas, particularly small and medium-sized companies, have performed relatively weaker this year. Baron noted that the market's largest stocks account for a large portion of the returns, and that excluding these stocks makes the overall market return appear lower. Related News: What's the Latest Outlook for XRP? Here Are the Critical Levels That Must Be Protected and Overcome Explaining the basis of his investment philosophy, Baron pointed out that inflation continually erodes the value of money. He stated that people will need to earn twice as much as they do today within 15 years to maintain their purchasing power. Baron's main thesis, however, hinges on the fact that the stock market and the economy double every 10 to 12 years, as they have throughout his life. Therefore, he argued that the way to protect and increase the value of money in the face of inflation is through stock investments, not holding money in banks or bonds. While evaluating the performance of different asset classes, Ron Baron also made a brief reference to cryptocurrencies. While discussing the potential of the stock market, Baron briefly commented, “Bitcoin has been fantastic, obviously.” *This is not investment advice.

Many investors expected a fast reaction from XRP following the release, and while the ETF received significant attention after launch, XRP’s price has not met expectations. Coach JV (@Coachjv_), a well-known finance coach, recently commented on the community’s reaction and noted that many holders were focusing too heavily on instant price rally rather than on bigger market conditions. XRP What is Happening pic.twitter.com/4at0EdL1DD — Coach, JV (@Coachjv_) November 13, 2025 Community Expectations And Early Market Behavior Interest in the XRPC ETF was strong on launch day, and the fund quickly attracted significant volume . Despite that, XRP itself stayed relatively unchanged. Many traders believed XRP would rise sharply once the ETF became available. However, the digital asset did not print any significant gains. XRP now trades at $2.29. This stagnation created frustration among holders and led many to reconsider assumptions about how institutional access translates into market performance . Coach JV’s View On Investor Reactions Coach JV addressed the situation by challenging the belief that a single event guarantees immediate gains. He argued that many people become trapped by short-term thinking and unrealistic price expectations during periods of heightened attention. Other experts have warned that ETFs alone will not send XRP to $10 or $100 , and according to Coach JV, this mindset increases the risk of emotional trading and leads to decisions that disrupt long-term plans. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Structured Discipline and a Long-term Strategy Coach JV also focused on long-term discipline. He stated that he maintains confidence in XRP because he understands its role within Ripple’s business strategy and has prepared a structured investment system. “I don’t invest based on hype,” he stated while explaining that he made mistakes early in his investing journey by relying on unrealistic expectations. He argued that XRP still stands at the center of Ripple’s efforts , highlighting the company’s acquisitions and infrastructure expansion. The finance coach urged investors to avoid panic selling. He references past experiences when traders sold XRP at low prices only to miss substantial upside later. He repeated that no one should invest more than they can afford to lose and advised against leveraging crypto positions due to volatility. Outlook For XRP And The XRPC ETF Coach JV emphasized that interest rate changes and liquidity shifts will influence crypto performance, with Bitcoin moving first due to its liquidity. He expects strong market activity early next year as policies and new investment products take effect. He urged investors to focus on discipline and long-term strategy rather than short-term price movements. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.
