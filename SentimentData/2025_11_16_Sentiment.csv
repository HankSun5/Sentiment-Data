54450286,628532,1763238612,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54450286.jpeg,Matthew Sigel Triggers Uproar In XRP Community – Here’s What He Said,https://bitcoinist.com/matthew-sigel-triggers-uproar-in-xrp-community-heres-what-he-said/,"Matthew Sigel, the head of digital assets research at VanEck , has ignited a storm within the XRP community with a single sarcastic remark on X social media. While brief, his statement seemed to dismiss years of development and innovation behind the XRP Ledger (XRPL) , leaving many community members and industry analysts both shocked and aggrieved. Sigel’s words have sparked passionate debates about the value, utility, and understanding of XRP as a blockchain and digital asset. Sigel Draws Criticism For Subtly Mocking XRP Sigel’s controversial post appeared to be a subtle jab toward XRP enthusiasts, suggesting that he would never understand the XRPL blockchain but respected the passion and effort required to “pretend it does something.” Sigel’s mocking tone appeared to diminish the accomplishments of XRP over the years, provoking instant backlash from the cryptocurrency’s dedicated community. The VanEck executive implied that, despite the visible enthusiasm and hustle of supporters, the work behind XRP might ultimately be meaningless. His veiled critique about the blockchain and the community backing it struck a nerve, likely because XRP has been under development for over a decade, with consistent progress in regulatory navigation , DeFi applications, and cross-border payment solutions. Members of the XRP community who felt the post belittled the financial and technological innovations embedded in the blockchain’s ecosystem have voiced strong opinions that sharply contrast with Sigel’s statement. Some have even criticized the VanEck executive for his perceived lack of understanding and appreciation of the technology, particularly given his current role as head of digital asset research at the asset management company. XRP Community Pushes Back Against Sigel’s Statement In response to Sigel’s post on X, many prominent figures in the crypto space immediately challenged his mocking remarks. Panos Mekras, co-founder of Anodos Finance, highlighted the groundbreaking nature of the XRP Ledger, noting its ability to naturally deepen liquidity and act as a decentralized settlement layer without the risks associated with smart contracts or wallet exploits. Digital asset researcher Anders also criticized Sigel for publicly admitting a lack of understanding. At the same time, Ripple developer Matt Hamilton emphasized the professional responsibility of those in digital asset research to grasp the fundamentals of blockchain. Popular market analyst CryptoSensei mocked the irony of VanEck’s research lead dismissing XRP’s technological innovations, suggesting the asset management company might need to hire new blockchain experts. Community members joined the chorus, highlighting that XRP , like Bitcoin, serves as a cornerstone of value and liquidity, and that the collective effort of investors, developers, and enthusiasts lends it unique utility. Other members appeared to be educating Sigel on XRP’s longstanding role in global payments and settlement, stressing that minimal transaction volume does not equate to lack of value, drawing parallels to BTC’s historical pattern. Despite Sigel acknowledging that he would never make sense of the XRP blockchain, supporters remain resolute, using the controversy to enlighten and amplify the network’s achievements and ongoing developments.

Their latest video outlines what they view as a rapidly changing environment for digital assets, with particular attention on regulatory developments, institutional inflows, macroeconomic factors, and shifting financial conditions in the United States. The update focuses heavily on what they believe could influence XRP’s trajectory in the near term. Ripple #XRP HOLY SH*T HE KNOWS THE XRP PRICE SURGE DATE?!?!? (PREPARE NOW!) pic.twitter.com/IDwb3WHMt5 — BULLRUNNERS (@BullrunnersHQ) November 13, 2025 XRP ETF Expectations and Price Projections BullRunners opened their breakdown by stating that the SEC has approved the Canary Capital Spot XRP ETF, which, according to recent updates, has begun trading. They added that Jake Claver expects XRP to reach three- or four-digit price levels if multiple ETFs debut together. According to BullRunners, nine XRP ETFs may go live within a seven- to ten-day window, a scenario they argue could create substantial market movement. They referenced JP Morgan’s estimate of approximately $8 billion in first-year inflows into these funds, suggesting that the circulating supply of XRP on exchanges may be insufficient to absorb that level of demand. In their view, this raises the possibility of an eventual supply squeeze and reduced availability on trading platforms. Broader Crypto Commentary and Regulatory Notes Beyond ETF speculation, BullRunners shifted to lighter commentary on crypto ownership, referencing a CNBC study they claim links cryptocurrency holdings to improved desirability in dating environments. They then moved toward risk-management discussions, promising additional strategies later in the video. The video also touched on U.S. tax guidance, stating that the IRS treats cryptocurrency as real property and emphasizing documentation requirements for those exceeding $19,000 per person in 2025. BullRunners promoted tax-education resources through Altcoin Pro University, positioning them as useful for investors seeking clarity. Macroeconomic Outlook and Liquidity Discussions BullRunners expanded their focus to monetary policy and economic pressures. They said 7 of 12 Federal Reserve members support a 50-basis-point rate cut for December, referencing Deutsche Bank’s expectation that quantitative easing could return in early 2026. They described these factors as components of a potential liquidity wave, though they noted that retail participation remains limited for now.

They pointed to the last stimulus cycle as a period that coincided with strong market activity. Housing Affordability and Employment Concerns The commentary moved into housing challenges, citing the growing consideration of 50-year mortgages for younger generations despite significantly higher lifetime interest costs. BullRunners presented an example comparing past and present home affordability in Utah and argued that many buyers face limited options due to location constraints. They closed with concerns about rising unemployment expectations and an increase in Google searches for second jobs. BullRunners suggested that some individuals may view day trading as an alternative source of income. They ended the segment by posing this possibility to their audience.

The meme coin space in 2025 embodies that same electric blend of chaos and creativity, where humor fuels innovation and risk meets reward. Investors aren’t merely chasing hype anymore; they’re embracing digital culture as a legitimate financial frontier. Each meme coin now represents a movement, merging storytelling with speculation. Within this vibrant digital carnival, fortunes rise, communities grow, and entertainment becomes an undeniable gateway to modern-day investing success. Dogecoin remains the heartbeat of the meme coin revolution, symbolizing simplicity, trust, and accessibility within a decentralized framework. It continues to serve as the people’s crypto, standing as the first meme token to achieve mainstream credibility. Meanwhile, Mog Coin captivates Gen-Z through viral humor, social momentum, and digital creativity, keeping cultural engagement at its core. Yet BullZilla ($BZIL) towers above as the structured disruptor, combining innovation, emotion, and strategy to convert excitement into measurable opportunity.

Here Are the Critical Levels That Must Be Protected and Overcome,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/whats-the-latest-outlook-for-xrp-here-are-the-critical-levels-that-must-be-protected-and-overcome/,"Cryptocurrency analysis firm MakroVision reported in its latest chart assessment for XRP that the asset's technical outlook remains weak. Analysts argued that despite the recent recovery, the price could not stay above critical levels and selling pressure continued. XRP's failure to sustain a breakout above $2.48 is among the key factors driving short-term weakness in the market, according to MakroVision. Despite recent attempts to rally, the price has been rejected from this resistance once again. The company noted that XRP has tested the $2.16 area (the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level) several times in recent days, but there has been no strong buyer response from this area. If this support level is broken, analysts predict the price could quickly retreat to the $2.02-$1.88 range. This area is considered critical because it contains both horizontal support and key Fibonacci levels. Related News: American Billionaire Scaramucci and Trump Form Bitcoin Alliance - Announce Major Investment The assessment stated that for XRP to regain strength, it must first break above the $2.48 level. If this level is broken, the price could find room to reach the $2.65 region, where liquidity is high. MakroVision shared the following conclusion regarding the current technical picture: XRP remains technically weak. Unless the $248 level is retaken, the risk of a new correction towards the $2.00-$1.87 range outweighs the risk. A downside break below these support areas could significantly weaken the medium-term trend. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: What’s the Latest Outlook for XRP?

Despite a recent price dip, a bearish-sounding Death Cross has just triggered precisely at a major structural support, the lower boundary of a long-term pattern. This bullish confluence, where historical market bottoms align with key technical support, suggests that the correction is complete and a significant upward bounce is imminent in the short term. $100,460 Range Low Now Flipped Into Key Resistance BTC has officially lost the range low and slipped to the $96,000 area, according to Lennaert Snyder, who outlined a clear game plan for the days ahead. He noted that the former range low of $100,460 has now flipped into a key resistance level, shaping the next phase of market behavior. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rejection Was No Accident — Now The Battle Shifts To $93,000–$97,000 Survival Zone Snyder explained that if Bitcoin retests the $100,460 mark, the reaction will determine the next move. A rejection at that level would favor short setups, while a successful reclaim would open the door for bullish opportunities. Should BTC reclaim the range low, Snyder expects bullish momentum to kick in, with the first target sitting near the $103,460 resistance area. A push into that zone would signal that buyers are regaining meaningful control over the market. Despite the recent drop, Snyder emphasized that there’s still plenty of liquidity and support below current prices while watching for deeper tests that could provide long entries once reversal signals begin to form. Overall, the market remains technically clean, and price action continues to respect every level with precision. Death Cross Triggers At Megaphone Support — Timing Could Be Perfect For Bitcoin According to a recent post by Colin Talks Crypto, Bitcoin has just flashed a major signal, the Death Cross, which has historically aligned with market bottoms rather than tops despite its ominous name. What makes this even more compelling is its perfect timing: the setup triggered at the exact moment BTC touched the lower boundary of its expanding megaphone pattern. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crashes To $98,000 As HODLer Selling Accelerates The expert noted that this scenario was projected weeks in advance, with mid-November marked as the window to watch. Right on schedule, Bitcoin has landed precisely where the analysis suggested it would. Colin explained that death crosses often act as bottom markers at the tail end of downtrends. Pairing that with BTC hitting a major structural support gives the setup even stronger bullish undertones. It’s not just a technical coincidence – it’s a confluence backed by pattern behavior. With these elements lining up, he believes the probability of an upward reaction from here is high. The chart structure now favors a short-term bounce, suggesting that Bitcoin could soon shift away from weakness and begin carving out a recovery move.

Co-authored by Ethereum Foundation (EF) researchers Yoav Weiss and Marissa, the initiative is based on the principle that Ethereum was not created to make finance efficient, but was made so people could coordinate without trust in intermediaries. Hidden Centralization Risks The team argues that a protocol begins to compromise its core identity the moment a centralized part, like a hosted node or a controlled relayer, is used. They explained that while these decisions may appear insignificant at first, they gradually form a pattern that undermines permissionless access, which sacrifices efficiency and a refined user interface. “The manifesto is a statement of those values: credible neutrality, self-custody, verifiability, and resistance to ‘convenient’ centralization,” wrote the team via X. The document defines a system as truly trustless only when any honest user can join, verify, and take part freely without needing permission or fearing interference. This depends on every action being fully verifiable through public data and on ensuring that no single operator becomes essential to the system’s function. The EF also warns that simplicity built on reliance is not a sign of progress but a loss of independence. “When complexity tempts us to centralize, we must remember: every line of convenience code can become a choke point,” the authors wrote. The manifesto points to the growing use of centralized infrastructure, such as major cloud providers hosting blockchain nodes, as proof of this slow drift toward dependence. The recent Amazon Web Services outage highlighted the risk. Coinbase’s Base chain saw its transaction capacity drop by about 25% when its AWS-hosted sequencer went offline, while Arbitrum and Optimism continued running smoothly because they use multiple cloud providers. Blockchains Urged to Prioritize Trustlessness Over Transaction Volume This message comes at a time when some Layer 2 networks have faced criticism for chasing fast scalability at the expense of full decentralization. Optimism, Arbitrum, and Base have gotten scrutiny for risks like single sequencer control and delayed decentralization plans due to limited community participation in governance. The authors propose a new way to assess the long-term health of a blockchain project by how much it reduces reliance on trust with every transaction, instead of by how many transactions it processes. Developers who want to take the pledge must connect their wallet, read the manifesto, click “Sign the Trustless Manifesto Pledge,” and confirm the transaction. The initiative has already gained support from several figures in the Ethereum community, including EF member Tom Teman and pseudonymous crypto researcher hitas.base.eth.

Dogecoin (DOGE) is still proving to be a resilient performer, with strong community backing and crucial levels well above $0.20, while a number are holding strong around their support level, including Ripple (XRP), which is now looking to rebound towards $3.00. Among the established cryptocurrencies, a fresh face has managed to make a rapid appearance, that being Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Being solely in Presale Stage 6, MUTM has already managed to sell out 90% of this presale round, all at a low price of just $0.035, now sitting well over the initial target set, reaching a strong total so far of over $18.8 million at this early stage of presale, all well before its market entry as a fully fledged cryptocurrency. Investors are labeling MUTM as one of the best cryptos to buy for its early-stage growth and utility. Dogecoin (DOGE) Exhibits Signs of Fresh Bullish Trends Dogecoin (DOGE) has transitioned from a strong downtrend to a strong upward move, indicating a potential takeover by the bulls. Currently, Dogecoin price is sustaining around an important resistance level, fighting to make a comeback, and a successful breakout may bring even better gains. On the other hand, a failed breakout could bring a small dip before moving towards the next leg. Although Dogecoin is performing well as a trading asset, investors are now focusing their attention on Mutuum Finance (MUTM). MUTM presale is gaining traction due to its novel DeFi solution, as the current presale stage is almost fully sold out, making it a must-watch in the top cryptocurrencies list for 2025. XRP Awaits ETF Approval The anticipation around the upcoming Canary Capital XRP ETF, slated to list this Thursday, may bring substantial institutional investment to Ripple. Currently, XRP is seen trading around $2.43, down by a marginal 3%, but holding a vital support level around $2.20. The bulls will now have to breach the resistance level between $2.63 and $2.72 to get a fresh swing high, failing which may toe the price lower to around $2. Even as traders are keeping a keen eye on the arrival of the first-ever ETF by XRP, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining substantial attention among investors due to its revolutionary DeFi initiative and presale activities, establishing itself as one of the best cryptos to buy in the market today. Mutuum Finance Enthralls DeFi Investors Mutuum Finance is rapidly emerging as the top cryptocurrencies investment for early adopters wanting to be part of this revolutionary initiative. The current presale is a fantastic opportunity to purchase MUTM tokens before they are listed on exchanges. The presale is now at phase 6, with tokens sold at a price of $0.035, which is well over three times the price charged at presale phase 1. It should be noted that the presale has managed to accumulate well over $18.8 million, all from 17,980 participants, with phase 6 well past 90% completion. It could be concluded that MUTM is the best cryptos to buy for 2025, as well as a leading DeFi project to watch due to its innovative dual lending model, among other virtues. Creating a Balanced and Comprehensive Ecosystem The presale of Mutuum Finance has been conceptualized to ensure a high degree of transparency, fairness, and sustainability. Out of a total 4 billion MUTM tokens, around 1.82 billion, or 45.5%, have been allocated for the presale period. The response so far has seen over 795 million tokens sold, representing strong interest among both retail and institutional buyers. Mutuum Finance has so far accumulated over 18.8 million, with over 795 million MUTM tokens bought by approximately 18,000 investors. The presale is in phase 6, which is over 90% complete, providing a final opportunity to purchase MUTM tokens at a price of $0.035, as this will rise to $0.04 in presale phase 7. Mutuum Finance’s dual lending, rewarding, and increasingly populous community are making MUTM the top cryptocurrencies pick for investors to keep an eye on in 2025. Lock in your investment opportunity today before entering the big market, and ensure your early position in one of the most promising new crypto coin launches of the year.

54453276,628549,1763244036,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54453276.jpeg,Bitcoin New Role: Here’s How BTC Is Increasingly Intertwined With The Business Cycle,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-and-the-business-cycle/,"Bitcoin is stepping into a new era where its movements can no longer be explained by crypto-native events. Instead, BTC has become increasingly intertwined with the global business cycle, reacting to shifts in institutional positioning. As the market matures, BTC behaves less like a speculative outlier and more like a macro-sensitive asset that rises and falls with the broader economic pulse. Liquidity Cycles Drive Bitcoin More Than Crypto Narratives The correlation between the business cycle and Bitcoin has never been clearer, and the latest chart has made the connection harder to ignore. According to a well-known crypto news analysis on X, CryptosRus, this chart overlays BTC price action with the broader macro business cycle, and the alignment is almost striking. Currently, BTC appears to be approaching a cycle bottom that mirrors previous macro business-cycle lows. What makes this setup compelling is the record-long pre-parabolic phase in BTC history. If this pattern continues, the next major expansion phase may be closer than expected. The market is entering a meaningful turning point. The Co-founders of Glassnode, Swissblock, and censeAG, Negentropic, stated that the Treasury General Account (TGA) drain began on November 14th, and historically, its liquidity flow leads Bitcoin by roughly one week. During the 2019 government shutdown, BTC found its bottom and began recovering within 12 days as liquidity started normalizing. This recent stretch has been the most challenging phase of the liquidity squeeze , and its peak effect has hit this week. The government’s reopening of an estimated $150 billion in excess TGA liquidity is providing a meaningful tailwind as it enters the markets. With the economic data on pause during the government shutdown, the near-term repricing has been influenced by uncertainty. Meanwhile, the Nvidia earnings next week will offer the next clear signal for risk . “The worst of the squeeze is likely behind us, and the setup is improving. Patience is key,” Negentropic noted. Government Liquidity Injection Could Neutralize Recession Fears Brian Rose, the founder and host of LondonRealTV, has also offered an insight into the current market setup, stating that the Federal Reserve has officially announced the end of quantitative tightening (QT). At the same time, the US government is reopening and unleashing more than $100 billion of pent-up liquidity directly back into the system. According to Brian, BTC sentiment is the worst he has seen in years. In the short term, there’s fear around recessionary jobs data, while in the mid-term, there are real catalysts for liquidity. However, as long as nothing is breaking, the market can handle bad data. This is a strange mix of despair and fresh money. Historically, the extreme pessimism combined with liquidity injections has been the exact setup where rallies begin.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Brian Rose|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|CenseAG|CryptosRus|Fed|Federal Reserve|Glassnode|LondonRealTV|Negentropic|Nvidia|QT|Quantitative Tightening|Swissblock|TGA|Treasury General Account,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-15 22:00:36

Major assets slipped sharply, altcoins bled double digits and sentiment across the industry shifted almost overnight. For newcomers, it looked like chaos. For veterans, it was just another day in the world of digital assets. But this time something different is happening. As markets shake, users are moving toward platforms considered more stable, transparent and regulated. And one name keeps circulating more than expected: RentStac . Why the Crash Caught So Many Off Guard Crypto downturns are nothing new, yet the latest drop hit harder than many anticipated. Many investors realized they were relying too heavily on assets that swing wildly in price. Overnight, social media was full of panicked posts, frustrated traders and people questioning whether crypto was still worth it. But while some chased losses, others started looking for safer, more predictable opportunities. And that shift opened the door for alternatives that don’t depend on daily price swings. The New Trend: Investors Are Choosing Stability Over Hype During every major market correction, there are two types of investors. Those who panic and exit. And those who use the downturn to rethink their strategy. The second group is growing fast. Instead of relying purely on speculation, many retail investors are now gravitating toward platforms that offer structured, traceable and reliable digital income streams. This is exactly why RentStac has become a topic of conversation: it doesn’t behave like a typical crypto project and isn’t tied to unpredictable market cycles. RentStac’s Legitimacy Is Becoming a Key Talking Point One of the biggest surprises during the crash was how frequently RentStac appeared in discussions about safer alternatives. Users pointed to its transparency, clear operational model and compliance-driven approach as reasons it stands out from countless speculative platforms. Unlike projects that rely on hype or price pumps, RentStac presents itself as a legitimate digital income solution backed by verifiable operations. The platform has been praised for avoiding the typical “too good to be true” promises that destroyed many crypto projects during previous downturns. And in a climate where trust is everything, that difference matters. Why Investors See RentStac as a “Crash-Proof” Model No platform is completely risk-free. But RentStac benefits from something the crypto market often lacks: predictable returns that don’t depend on sudden price movements. When Bitcoin drops 15 percent in a weekend, platforms like RentStac don’t collapse. They continue functioning as usual because their model isn’t built on speculation. This is one of the main reasons retail investors are calling it “one of the few legit options left” during market volatility. In short, RentStac doesn’t try to replace crypto. It complements it with a model grounded in real operations rather than hype. Crypto May Crash, but Investor Behavior Is Evolving Every market downturn teaches the same lesson. Hype is temporary. Legitimacy survives. This crash didn’t just expose weaknesses in overleveraged coins. It highlighted a shift in investor psychology. People are tired of unstable promises.

After slipping beneath the psychological $100,000 support, worries have surfaced among Bitcoin market participants regarding the broader market structure. Interestingly, the latest on-chain evaluation justifies this worry, as the downside bias for the Bitcoin price seems to be on the rise. Binance Taker Imbalance Falls Into Negative Territory In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, on-chain research firm Arab Chain revealed an increase in sell-side momentum for Bitcoin on Binance, the world’s largest exchange by trading volume. This revelation revolves around the BTC Taker Imbalance % metric, which tracks whether the market is dominated by aggressive buyers or sellers. Narrowing it down, this metric offers insights into taker activity on Binance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Moves Beyond Retail — Institutional Ownership Now Defines The Market Because the metric works by revealing the percentage difference between taker buy volume and taker sell volume, readings with positive values suggest the dominance of buyers in the market. On the contrary, negative readings reveal a seller-dominated market. As Arab Chain reported, there has been an evident spike in the amount of selling pressure in recent hours. A Taker Imbalance % reading of -0.17%, which typically reflects continued bearish action, supports this observation. Moreover, the research firm pointed out that there has been an evident difference between the selling and buying volumes recently. The Quicktake post revealed a record of $1.517 billion in selling volume against $1.058 billion dedicated to buying power, making it clear what party is currently winning this Bitcoin price tussle. Is $92,000 The Next Bitcoin Price Target? What’s interesting is, the current seller-dominated market has caused the BTC price to continuously hover around the key $94,000 level. Arab Chain noted that each attempt by the Bitcoin price to rise has faced an even greater amount of sell resistance, dousing any serious bullish momentum. The grey bars in the above chart suggest that this increasing bearish pressure might not just be a market correction; instead, it reflects a recurrent injection of sell-pressure, one which Arab Chain implied would eventually defeat the weaker buy-side liquidity at the current support. In the likely scenario where more bearish momentum is injected to push the market to the downside, the next level, which could act as a cushion for price, lies around $92,000. If a significant amount of liquidity is not introduced to neutralize the dominance of Bitcoin’s sellers, the Bitcoin price could see an even deeper bearish correction. At press time, Bitcoin is valued at $96,241, reflecting a nearly 2% loss in the past day.

Among the featured assets is XRP, which the firm describes as having real-world utility made tangible, underscoring its importance within the ETF’s structure and the broader digital asset market. The installations accompany the growing attention surrounding the GDLC fund, which went live in September 2025 and offers regulated exposure to several major cryptocurrencies. XRP’s presence in the campaign reflects its position as one of the fund’s key holdings. Presentation of the GDLC Components Grayscale announced the initiative through an update on X, noting that it was bringing the digital assets represented in GDLC into public spaces. Large-format displays have been placed at various locations around New York City, each corresponding to one of the five assets included in the ETF. We brought Grayscale CoinDesk Crypto 5 ETF $GDLC to the real world pic.twitter.com/Uo0JYDqq0x — Grayscale (@Grayscale) November 7, 2025 The installations emphasize the distinct roles of the assets within the cryptocurrency landscape. The messaging attached to each display communicates how Grayscale views the function or contribution of the respective digital asset. XRP’s display highlights its utility-focused reputation and the practical use cases associated with the asset. By presenting these installations publicly, Grayscale aims to increase visibility for the fund and expand awareness of the digital assets it tracks. XRP’s Allocation Within the GDLC Fund The new promotional effort coincides with GDLC’s entrance into the market on September 19, 2025. The ETF is positioned as the first U.S.-listed investment product that gives exposure to several leading digital assets within one regulated structure. The fund’s composition is determined by market capitalization weighting and is rebalanced periodically. As of the latest available update, the GDLC fund is structured with Bitcoin holding the largest share at 75.53%, followed by Ethereum at 15.20%. XRP accounts for 5.45% of the portfolio, while Solana represents 3.08% and Cardano holds the remaining 0.74%. XRP’s share of more than five percent demonstrates the token’s relevance within institutional portfolios that emphasize diversified exposure. Its inclusion at this level suggests that Grayscale considers it an established component of the large-cap digital asset sector. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Structure of the ETF and Current Market Metrics GDLC tracks the collective value of the underlying cryptocurrencies using net asset value (NAV) methodology. Investors gain access to the assets through the ETF without having to manage private keys or directly custody digital tokens. Asset custody for the fund is handled by Coinbase Custody Trust Company. As of November 14, 2025, the fund reports the following data: Non-GAAP assets under management: $579,304,467 NAV per share: $44.88 Market price: $44.85 Shares traded daily: 980,645 One-day NAV change: –$1.52 (–3.28%) One-day market price change: –$1.45 (–3.13%) Premium or discount: –0.07% Although the fund has experienced short-term price movement in line with broader market conditions, the close alignment between NAV and market price indicates stable trading performance for a multi-asset crypto ETF. Implications for XRP and Broader Market Positioning Grayscale’s decision to highlight XRP alongside Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano in a major public campaign indicates the firm’s recognition of XRP’s place within the digital asset ecosystem. The emphasis on “real-world utility” aligns with narratives that present XRP as a token associated with practical financial applications and institutional use. The installations also arrive at a time when Grayscale is preparing additional XRP-related investment products. The company is currently advancing plans for a dedicated XRP spot ETF, with expectations that the product could proceed now that federal government operations have resumed. For XRP investors, the current campaign reinforces the asset’s increasing visibility within regulated financial products and its growing presence in institutional investment discussions.

The effort builds on work led by Commissioner Hester Peirce and the Crypto Task Force, which focuses on transparent and economically fair treatment of cryptocurrencies. SEC Clarifies Which Tokens Are Not Securities In a recent address, Atkins talked about the uncertainty surrounding crypto classification over the past decade, explaining that most of it comes from the changing nature of digital assets. According to him, a cryptocurrency being part of an investment contract under the Howey test does not make it permanently a security because such agreements can end. “I believe that most crypto tokens trading today are not themselves securities,” he said. The new framework is based on a proposed token taxonomy that categorizes cryptocurrencies by function and the purchaser’s expectations. Under this approach, digital commodities, or network tokens, are not classified as securities. Similarly, digital collectibles, such as NFTs, are also excluded from this category because buyers do not anticipate profits from the managerial efforts of others. Digital tools, which serve practical purposes like memberships, tickets, credentials, or identity verification, are also outside SEC oversight. On the other hand, tokenized securities continue to be regulated as securities. Atkins further discussed the application of the Howey test, which identifies investment contracts as involving the putting of money in a common enterprise with an expectation of getting profits from the efforts of others. He said that once the issuer fulfills, fails to satisfy, or terminates their managerial promises, the tokens may continue to trade without being considered securities. The initiative also includes plans for exemptions and a special offering for digital assets tied to investment contracts. The SEC will coordinate with Congress, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), banking regulators, and other stakeholders to create a regulatory environment that supports innovation while maintaining investor protections. Fraud remains subject to enforcement, and anti-fraud provisions will also apply to tokens no longer classified as securities. Shift for Digital Assets Project Crypto, first launched in July 2025, aims to provide clarity, fairness, and integrity for developers, investors, and intermediaries. Headed by Atkins and Peirce, the initiative was started to differentiate between securities and other digital assets. This week is proving pivotal for those looking for clearer rules around crypto. On November 10, the Senate Agriculture Committee shared a draft plan to regulate digital asset commodities. That same day, the U.S. Treasury and IRS issued guidance allowing staking on crypto ETPs and passing staking rewards on to retail investors.

American Bitcoin is a mining company backed by the Trump family, and it has big ambitions for the crypto industry, specifically focusing its business on Bitcoin. Fortune reported that the $220 million round was led by Solari Capital. Other backers in the round include Tony Robbins, Charles Hoskinson the co-founder of Cardano, Grant Cardone, and Peter Diamandis. Scaramuccis invest millions in Trump-backed Bitcoin miner Solari Capital, an investment firm led by AJ and Anthony Scaramucci, reportedly contributed more than $100 million in a July funding round for American Bitcoin . This is of note because of the Bitcoin mining company’s ties to Donald Trump’s sons. Anthony Scaramucci, AJ’s father and the founder of SkyBridge Capital, made a smaller personal investment, although he did not share the exact amount. Anthony Scaramucci is well-known for his short stint as White House communications director under Donald Trump and also for being quite critical of him afterward. However, both he and his son have been investing in American Bitcoin. The pair have said that their motive is their belief in the power of Bitcoin despite their dissatisfaction with Trump. AJ has even closer ties with American Bitcoin’s president, Matt Prusak, who was his roommate at Stanford Business School. According to Fortune , Prusak told AJ that American Bitcoin was being spun off from Hut 8, and AJ jumped on the opportunity. American Bitcoin’s operations American Bitcoin was launched by Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., in partnership with Hut 8. As part of the deal, Hut 8 contributed “substantially all” of its Bitcoin mining equipment, in exchange for 80% of the company’s shares. The Trump family reportedly holds the remaining stake. After a reverse merger in September, American Bitcoin began trading on the Nasdaq. According to its filings, it operates mining facilities in places including the Niagara Falls in Canada and Texas, with tens of thousands of mining rigs. As of mid-November 2025, American Bitcoin said it held 4,004 BTC, worth roughly $415 million at the time. According to a regulatory filing reported by Cryptopolitan, American Bitcoin raised the full $220 million through a private share placement. About $10 million of the amount was paid in Bitcoin instead of cash. The reported average “cost” for those shares was about $104,000 per Bitcoin, according to the same filing. Out of that capital, American Bitcoin said it would use some of it to buy more mining gear and also to build up its Bitcoin treasury. Eric Trump described American Bitcoin as a way to profit from Bitcoin without buying Bitcoin directly, a “proxy play” as he called it. This is similar to what Michael Saylor does with his company, which buys huge amounts of Bitcoin and lets investors gain exposure by owning the company’s stock. The Trump family’s publicly traded media business has also announced plans to raise $2.5 billion to build a Bitcoin treasury. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

The launch of the Canary Capital XRP ETF (XRPC) generated strong demand, posting more than $58 million in trading volume and attracting approximately $245 million in net inflows on its first trading day. This outcome has intensified market attention ahead of additional XRP ETF rollouts expected from several major issuers. Market Expectations Surrounding Upcoming XRP ETFs Following XRPC’s introduction , focus has shifted to the six remaining spot XRP ETFs that are awaiting their market debuts. Firms such as Grayscale, 21Shares, Franklin Templeton, and Bitwise are among the issuers preparing to enter the space. Should these products record even partial demand comparable to XRPC’s initial performance, they could collectively bring a sizable amount of new capital into the XRP market. If each of the remaining six funds were to attract half of XRPC’s opening-day inflows, the combined amount entering the market could exceed $700 million in their first sessions alone. While such symmetry is improbable, given varying investor preferences, issuer reputations, and timing differences, the possibility of substantial inflows has encouraged speculative modeling around how extended investment could influence XRP’s valuation. To provide a clearer assessment, this analysis examines a scenario in which all seven spot ETFs collectively receive $600 million in net inflows every month for one year. Although this estimate surpasses the inaugural figures from XRPC, it remains below the $10 billion that Canary Capital’s CEO projected could enter the products in their first month. Under the assumed conditions, 12 months of $600 million inflows would total $7.2 billion. Projected Effects on XRP’s Valuation Determining how ETF inflows translate into market capitalization presents difficulties, as inflows do not convert directly into price appreciation. A range of variables, including liquidity conditions, macroeconomic influences, and sell-side activity, can alter the relationship between inflows and realized market value. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 To form a conservative approximation, this analysis applies a 100× inflow multiplier, a framework sometimes used in digital asset modeling when estimating the broader impact of regulated investment products. Applying that multiplier to the simulated $7.2 billion inflow produces a hypothetical market capitalization increase of $720 billion. With XRP’s current valuation near $135 billion , the combined figure would be approximately $857 billion. Considering the circulating supply of roughly 60 billion tokens, this projected market capitalization corresponds to a potential price level of about $14.20 per XRP. Context From Ethereum’s ETF Inflow History Although this model presents an optimistic projection, historical trends indicate that strong ETF inflows do not guarantee price appreciation. Between November 2024 and October 2025, Ethereum-based ETFs recorded only one month of net outflows. Over those 12 months, the products accumulated a combined net inflow of roughly $14.7 billion. Despite these substantial inflows, Ethereum did not experience a sustained price increase due to broader market pressures and supply-side dynamics. This example illustrates that large inflows alone may be insufficient to drive consistent upward price movements. Overall, while the scenario of $600 million in monthly inflows is theoretically possible and has precedent in other crypto ETF markets, its direct effect on XRP price would depend on numerous external conditions. ETF demand is only one of several factors that determine long-term price behavior, and real-world results may differ significantly from modeled outcomes.

This indicates that Solaria is eager to integrate itself into the heart of the burgeoning European market for AI-based electricity . The new platform is built on a foundation of 3.4 gigawatts of already consolidated grid access in Spain, Italy, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Solaria has also applied for another 5 gigawatts, underscoring the company’s desire to secure as much capacity as possible in the lead-up to industry competition. The company hopes to finalize a deal by next summer, its nearby observers said. Neither Solaria nor Goldman Sachs released publicly available information. AI growth reshapes Europe’s power and data-center landscape. AI is drastically changing the world’s energy demand on a massive scale. Powerful training and running complex intelligence systems on AI models require a significant amount of electricity. Analysts suggest that power consumption due to AI could quadruple by the end of the next decade. Meanwhile, growing pressure is already mounting on data center developers and tech companies to identify large, long-term power supplies. The trend is more pronounced in Europe. Energy needs from data centers are anticipated to increase dramatically, potentially generating tens of gigawatts of new renewable capacity by 2030. Since solar energy has been regarded as a significant alternative to traditional energy sources, and its costs are falling steadily, Solaria is also moving quickly to stay ahead. These commitments are pressuring hyperscalers to align with energy developers who can guarantee not only capacity but also speed — areas in which Solaria has already demonstrated strength. The company’s home market, Spain, ranks among the most attractive to AI centers in Europe. It has ample sunlight, available land, and strong connections to undersea cables that cross the Atlantic, connecting Europe to Africa and the Americas. By 2035, data centers in Spain could account for as much as 6% of the country’s overall electricity demand, underscoring the importance of new renewable energy capacity. Solaria steps up investments to underpin its data-center strategy. Solaria accelerates investments to anchor its data-center strategy There already exists 1.2 gigawatts of grid-connection rights at Solaria, which are reserved for data-center development inside the territory that belongs to Spain. For example, Solaria signed a key memorandum of understanding in 2024 with Japan’s Datasection Inc. to construct a 200-megawatt AI data center at its Puertollano complex, in the city of Puertollano. This site features facilities in clean rooms, as well as the original manufacturing sites for photovoltaic cells, making it easily adaptable for advanced technology installations. The Puertollano project alone will cover nearly 100,000 square metres, a reflection of Solaria’s ambition to become a leader in energy and infrastructure collaboration for the global AI community. Solaria’s growth is supported by its strong financials. The company’s shares have now risen by almost 100% this year, thanks to investor confidence in its energy pipeline and its presence in the AI and data center space. A major part of the company’s ongoing rollout of solar projects and its goal to achieve 14.3 gigawatts of total capacity by 2028 through solar, wind, and battery storage is boosting revenues and profits. Should Solaria find a firm to partner with on this 3.4-gigawatt platform, it could become one of Europe’s leading suppliers of clean-powered data center infrastructure. The project is a fusion of two key global transitions — the move to renewable energy and the ascendance of AI computing. For big tech companies, the deal is a potential route to long-term clean energy for next-generation data centers. For Europe, it’s also a sign of how the continent’s energy and digital strategies are starting to connect. For Solaria, this represents a significant leap from being a top solar developer to a key player in the infrastructure supporting an AI revolution.

Analysts weighed on this increase, asserting that it likely resulted from their decision to accept Bitcoin at their restaurants. Therefore, with this move, Steak ‘n Shake has become popular in the Bitcoin community and demonstrates a growing trend among merchants beginning to accept Bitcoin for various goods and services. Additionally, sources noted that the decision to accept BTC for small, everyday purchases is a significant step toward broad acceptance. Interestingly, Steak ‘n Shake also revealed considering using Ether as a payment option at its locations to explore the crypto ecosystem further. This intention was made public after the company shared an X post last month asking individuals whether it is a good idea for them to start using Ether. Concerning crypto investors, sources close to the situation mentioned that this proposal sparked excitement in the ecosystem, showing that Steak ‘n Shake is interested in the industry as cryptocurrencies become more popular among individuals. A survey from a reliable source revealed that, out of 48,815 followers surveyed, approximately 53% voted in favor of the proposal. These results contributed to a strong reaction from the Bitcoin community . However, like other proposals, this suggestion received criticism from BTC supporters. To illustrate this claim, Bitcoin supporter Ron Sovereignty Swanson responded to the survey, mentioning that “ETH is just centralized trash. Bitcoin represents freedom. If you do this, you’ll lose all your Bitcoiner customers, including me.” Steak ‘n Shake dropped its intention to offer an ETH payment option Recent reports highlighted that although Steak ‘n Shake initially pledged to abide by the results of the social media poll, the company later reversed its decision to offer an ETH payment option. In a statement dated October 11, the same day they started the poll, the company said , “Poll canceled. We stand with Bitcoiners. You have made your choice known. Who even suggested this? I’m back at my desk.” Meanwhile, Steak ‘n Shake reported high sales for the third quarter of the fiscal year in November. According to their report, they experienced a 15% increase in same-store sales compared to the previous quarter. Moreover, for the same-store sales growth in the third quarter, the company surpassed all its competitors in the fast food sector. These rivals include McDonald’s, Burger King, Taco Bell, and Starbucks . Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

54458193,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=854162,1763253014,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/54458193.jpeg,Analyst Breaks Down Why There Can’t Be 7 Million XRP Holders,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/analyst-breaks-down-why-there-cant-be-7-million-xrp-holders/,"A recent comment from crypto analyst CryptoTank has brought attention to a long-standing misconception about the size of the XRP community. His post focused on the widely quoted figure of seven million XRP wallets and explained why this number does not represent the number of real holders. The clarification arrives at a time when XRP is now positioned to start to receive institutional inflows from the recently launched Canary Spot XRP ETF. Related Reading: Dogecoin Alert! Price Could Explode Over 2,800%, Analyst Says Why Wallet Count Does Not Equal Holder Count CryptoTank noted that nearly 7 million wallets holding XRP does not translate to millions of people owning the asset. He pointed out that he personally maintains roughly 30 wallets, and most committed XRP investors tend to operate between four and six on average. This means a single individual can appear multiple times in on-chain statistics, making the total wallet count an unreliable indicator of how many real participants exist. The view is simple: the actual number of distinct XRP holders is far lower than many assume, and he believes the true figure sits comfortably below 1 million worldwide. This paints a picture of a community that is still at an early stage compared to other major digital assets. If only a fraction of those seven million addresses belong to unique individuals, then the people who hold XRP today represent a much smaller, far earlier group than estimates imply. CryptoTank described this group as being “way ahead” of the world, meaning that current holders occupy a position that could become far more valuable once broader participation finally arrives. A small holder base means that any meaningful expansion in demand, whether retail or institutional, could have an outsized effect on price because the XRP price has not yet experienced the type of mass inflow seen in previous cycles for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Institutional Expansion With Spot XRP ETF This discussion arrives at a significant moment for XRP, particularly with the introduction of the newly launched Spot XRP ETF in the United States. The product widens XRP’s reach beyond its early holder group, allowing institutions and retail traders in regulated markets to also invest in the cryptocurrency. If the true population of XRP holders is small, the arrival of ETF demand could become a major turning point. As inflows grow, this new access point may mark the beginning of a shift from an early-holder community to a broader institutional and retail audience. Speaking of inflows, Canary’s Spot XRP ETF started its first full trading day with $243.05 million in inflows on November 14, according to data from SoSoValue.

Accordingly, even as Ethereum continues to rank among the top assets, smart investors are increasingly focusing their attention on early-stage cryptocurrencies with greater potential, and Mutuum Finance , an asset trading under the symbol MUTM, is quickly gaining traction as a next big crypto and the top crypto to buy before the market recognizes its significance. Currently at a low price point of just $0.035, MUTM is in presale phase 6, well over 90% sold, garnering over $18.8 million so far. Ethereum (ETH) Faces Key Resistance, Traders Remain Cautious The Ethereum network (ETH) recently tested its former support level at approximately $3,675, but this was rejected, and we’re now seeing prices drop below the Daily 200 EMA once again, which is a sign that investors are still cautious at this stage. Although the 200MA may provide a degree of support in the near-term, ETH will have to break out past the $3,700 mark if market sentiment is to return to a positive trajectory. Until this breakout is achieved, market participants are cautious about potential downward pressure. As a result of the technical hindrances presented by ETH, market interest is now focusing increasingly on Mutuum Finance (MUTM), considered the next big crypto and a top crypto to buy. Mutuum Finance Presale Soars Ahead Mutuum Finance is rapidly making a name among the most eagerly awaited DeFi crypto launches of 2025. Currently, the presale stage has already seen over 17,980 participants, raising over $18.8 million, with Phase 6 well over 90% complete, and MUTM tokens valued at $0.035, an appreciable hike compared to the initial Phase 1 price of $0.01. The presale is now moving into Phase 7, and the price per token will increase by 20%, pushing the price closer to the listing price, which is $0.06 per token. As the price continues to move upwards and Mutuum Finance is well-received due to growing mainstream acceptance, this seems like an ideal investment opportunity, guaranteeing strong returns on investment in the crypto market. Investors looking for the next big crypto and a top crypto to buy are increasingly turning to MUTM. Stablecoin Development & Layer 2 Scalability One of the most important forthcoming initiatives that Mutuum Finance will embark on is the development of an over-collaterized stablecoin. The development of a stablecoin is crucial as far as the liquidity dynamics of the ecosystem is concerned, as this will allow lending and borrowing activities to occur predictably and will keep the funds circulating in the ecosystem. Further, Mutuum Finance is working to integrate a Layer-2 solution, which will increase transaction speed as well as lower costs. It will therefore make the service even more enticing to individual investors, as well as institutional investment firms, thus benefiting Mutuum Finance as a lending service operating in the DeFi space. Strategic Project Positioning The presale offer by Mutuum Finance is structured to bring a set of key features that will drive the demand for the tokens, as well as a strong foundational approach. The project aims to attract both beginners and advanced users of DeFi services. A major advantage is having a dual lending structure that brings together lenders, borrowers, and liquidators to ensure liquidity. The interest rates can either be stable or variable, with the former offering safety when market volatility arises. The system will be fully functional as of the first day, so lending/borrowing will be possible immediately after the listing of the tokens, meaning that the value will depend directly on the operation of the system, creating a market from inception rather than having to wait months to see results. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already seen the successful raising of over $18.8 million from the involvement of around 18,000 participants, with Phase 6 well over 90% sold and tokens at just $0.035, although this will rise by a further 20% as it enters Phase 7. Offering a dual lending DeFi system, as well as rewards via staking, Mutuum Finance is an opportunity that will bring investors on board as a valuable early-stage project, well before widespread acceptance, making it the next big crypto and the top crypto to buy today.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-you-are-very-wrong-about-this-xrp-dump-heres-why/,"The current plunge in XRP has rattled many traders, but a close look suggests that panic may be misplaced. Rather than signaling a brutal bear capitulation, the recent drop could actually be laying the groundwork for a powerful rebound. Monthly Stochastic RSI: A Historical Buy Zone According to STEPH IS CRYPTO, the monthly Stochastic RSI for XRP is once again approaching a key support zone around 40. Historically, this level has acted as a strong trough after a full overbought cycle. Steph points out that in both the 2017 and 2021 bull runs, XRP’s Stochastic RSI dropped from overbought, found support near 40, and then exploded higher. He argues that the current setup strongly mirrors those prior inflection points. Bearish Candle, Bullish Implication Steph also highlights the October monthly candle, which left a prominent lower wick on the XRP chart. He interprets this as a sign of rejection — a classic liquidity hunt where weak hands were flushed out before price reversed. Such wicks often mark local lows or bear market capitulation zones, according to his analysis. You Are VERY Wrong About This #XRP Dump. pic.twitter.com/awPUQCdNxd — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) November 15, 2025 Other Signals Align On shorter timeframes, Steph points to a liquidation heatmap showing a large cluster of short positions stacked above the current XRP price. In his view, this creates strong potential for a short squeeze. If XRP reverses upward, those short trades could be forced to cover, adding upward fuel to the rally. While some traders are alarmed by a recent daily “death cross” — when the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day — Steph challenges the bearish interpretation. He notes that similar patterns have appeared near prior bottoms. Rather than signaling a long-term breakdown, he argues this could be a setup for another major leg up. Steph further emphasizes the daily RSI, which he says is breaking out in a way that historically preceded strong upside moves. For him, this adds to the narrative that the recent drop is not pure weakness, but part of a broader accumulation phase. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Context: Optimism & Skepticism The broader XRP community appears split. Some analysts echo Steph’s bullish case, pointing to the Stochastic RSI pattern and liquidity structure as compelling. Others warn of near-term risks: renewed selling pressure, whale unloads, and potential retests of lower support. Still, even among skeptics, a common refrain is do not panic: many view the volatility as clearing the path for a bigger move. A Tactical Opportunity, Not a Breakdown Steph Is Crypto’s framework suggests this is not a breakdown, but a tactical setup . The convergence of a historically bullish Stochastic RSI level, a capitulation-style wick, and clustered short liquidity makes the case for a potential bounce strong. While nothing is guaranteed in crypto, his analysis argues that the current dump might be precisely the type of reset that precedes a major move higher. If history repeats, this could mark the beginning of a renewed bullish cycle for XRP, not the end. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The cryptocurrency market just witnessed a significant movement as Bitcoin price tumbled below the crucial $95,000 mark. According to real-time market data from Bitcoin World, BTC is currently trading at $94,994.63 on the Binance USDT market, sending ripples across the entire crypto ecosystem. Why Did Bitcoin Price Drop Below $95,000? The sudden Bitcoin price correction caught many investors by surprise. Market analysts point to several contributing factors that triggered this downward movement. First, increased selling pressure from large holders created temporary imbalance in market liquidity. Second, global economic uncertainties continue to influence investor sentiment across all risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Technical indicators also played a role in this Bitcoin price movement. The $95,000 level served as a key psychological support zone. When this level broke, it triggered automated sell orders and stop-loss positions, accelerating the decline. However, experienced traders often view such corrections as healthy market adjustments that create new buying opportunities. What Does This Bitcoin Price Movement Mean for Investors? Understanding market cycles is crucial for cryptocurrency investors. The current Bitcoin price action demonstrates several important market characteristics: Volatility remains inherent in cryptocurrency markets Key support levels often trigger significant price movements Market sentiment can shift rapidly based on technical breaks Trading volume typically increases during major price movements For long-term investors, these fluctuations represent normal market behavior. The fundamental value proposition of Bitcoin remains unchanged despite short-term price movements. Many analysts consider these dips as potential entry points for investors who missed earlier opportunities. How to Navigate Bitcoin Price Volatility? Successful cryptocurrency investing requires strategic thinking during price swings. When the Bitcoin price experiences significant movements, consider these approaches: Dollar-cost averaging reduces timing risk Portfolio diversification manages overall exposure Risk management protects against extreme volatility Fundamental analysis helps maintain long-term perspective Remember that cryptocurrency markets operate 24/7, and price movements can reverse quickly. The current Bitcoin price situation may present different opportunities for various types of investors, from day traders to long-term holders. What’s Next for Bitcoin Price Action? Market watchers are closely monitoring several key levels that could influence future Bitcoin price direction. The $94,000-$95,000 zone now becomes crucial for determining short-term momentum. A sustained break below could test lower support levels, while recovery above $96,000 might signal renewed bullish sentiment. Institutional interest continues to grow despite price fluctuations. Major financial institutions and corporations maintain their Bitcoin exposure, suggesting confidence in the long-term value proposition. This institutional participation often provides stability during retail-driven volatility episodes. Final Thoughts on Current Market Conditions The cryptocurrency market demonstrates its dynamic nature once again with this Bitcoin price movement. While breaking below $95,000 captures headlines, experienced investors understand that these fluctuations represent normal market behavior. The fundamental adoption story continues unfolding, with technological developments and institutional integration progressing steadily. Market corrections often separate emotional reactions from strategic decisions. Successful investors typically focus on long-term trends rather than short-term price movements. The current Bitcoin price action serves as another reminder about the importance of risk management and disciplined investment strategies in volatile markets. Frequently Asked Questions Why did Bitcoin price drop below $95,000? The decline resulted from combination of technical factors breaking key support levels, increased selling pressure, and broader market sentiment shifts affecting risk assets. Should I sell my Bitcoin during this price drop? Investment decisions should align with your financial goals and risk tolerance. Many investors use dips as buying opportunities, while others maintain their long-term positions regardless of short-term fluctuations. How low could Bitcoin price go? Predicting exact price levels is impossible, but technical analysts monitor support zones around $92,000 and $90,000 as potential areas where buying interest might increase. Will Bitcoin price recover quickly? Cryptocurrency markets can reverse rapidly, but recovery timing depends on multiple factors including market sentiment, trading volume, and broader economic conditions. Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? Price corrections often attract buyers seeking better entry points, but always conduct personal research and consider your investment strategy before making decisions. How does this affect other cryptocurrencies? Bitcoin price movements typically influence the broader cryptocurrency market, with many altcoins showing correlated price action during significant BTC movements. Found this analysis helpful?

The revised outlook, due to be released next week, indicates that Europe’s recovery is much shakier than officials had anticipated. EU officials say increasing U.S. tariffs and unresolved trade disputes are now the top obstacles to growth. The Trump administration’s tariff measures, introduced last year, continue to affect European exporters, particularly in manufacturing-dominated sectors such as steel, machinery, and automobiles. Brussels had expected pressures to abate by 2026, but had also anticipated a modest recovery. Previous estimates put growth at around 1.4%. That estimate is now expected to be drastically lower, reflecting the cumulative impact of trade barriers and investor risk. The jolts from U.S.-EU trade tensions are also giving businesses pause. Local companies are deferring investments amid fears about market access, supply chain risks, and the uncertainty of tariffs. Emerging global competition, a stronger euro, and a downturn in foreign demand are also contributing to headwinds for the export outlook. The uncertainty itself, economists say, is now one of Europe’s most serious economic threats, as opposed to the tariffs alone. Confidence has declined, supply-chain planning has become more difficult, and the specter of further escalation in trade looms over every forecast. Major economies lose momentum Germany, the EU’s largest economy , is experiencing a particularly challenging time. Yet despite expanding public spending on defense and infrastructure, the nation’s recovery has lagged. Industrial production has struggled to gain traction, and Germany’s chronic competitiveness woes have taken root. What was counted on to be Germany’s best post-pandemic year of growth has now become just another disappointing cycle. The country’s Council of Economic Experts recently cut its 2026 growth forecasts to 1%, citing weaker global demand and higher production costs. France, the bloc’s second-largest economy, faces a different challenge. Growth has proven resilient, but political instability is weighing on consumer and investor confidence. An estimated half-percentage point of France’s growth for the year is being cut by uncertainty, including domestic political disputes and budget tensions, according to analysts. Across the region, policymakers are also issuing warnings about structural risks, including rising energy costs, demographic shifts, and widening innovation gaps compared to the United States and certain parts of Asia. The European Central Bank has already moved to help prop up the struggling economy. It has cut interest rates several times this year, aiming to stabilize credit conditions and stimulate investment. However, ECB officials recognize that monetary policy alone cannot alleviate the weight of drag caused by external trade pressures. In its latest assessment, the ECB stated that ‘elevated uncertainty, high effective tariffs and tightening global competition’ remain key issues that impede Europe’s recovery momentum. Business investment is weak, and exports are not expected to recover overnight without a deceleration of global tensions. Fiscal policy, on the other hand, is stretched. Policy responds, but risks stay high A handful of member countries, including Italy, made strides in stabilizing public finances; others, such as France, are expected to post some of the largest deficits in the euro area. Divergent budget approaches can compromise the EU’s ability to forge a coordinated, strong collective response. EU leaders today are seeking to strike the right balance between the need to bolster domestic competitiveness and the complexities of the geopolitical environment. For the bloc, this means working to boost investment in technology, clean energy, industrial resilience, and other areas to shield the bloc from external shocks. Politically, Brussels continues to pursue stability in trade relations with Washington. Any easing of tariff pressures or steps toward new deals could quickly boost the economic outlook. However, officials warn that the threat of new trade disputes is “high,” and that Europe would need to prepare for a prolonged era of global fragmentation. By now, the message from Europe’s institutions is clearer than ever: the recovery is slowing, trade pressures are growing, and without a decisive response, growth prospects for the region will continue to fade into 2026.

During an interview with the Finnish newspaper published on Saturday, November 15, Rehn highlighted that reduced energy prices, lowered wage and service inflation, and a stronger euro could result in the overall inflation dropping significantly compared to their 2% target. “This risk should not be taken lightly,” the governor added when asked whether the ECB might reduce interest rates again in December. However, Rehn also stated that there are risks of escalating inflation to consider. Therefore, with inflation near ECB’s 2% goal, investors and economists do not expect sudden alterations to the deposit rate. Notably, the deposit rate has decreased approximately eight times during this cycle, from 4% to 2%. Rehn warned that the stock markets are clearly in danger of a crash The euro area economy has demonstrated impressive performance despite US President Donald Trump’s tariff policies interfering with global trade. According to reports from the governor of the Bank of Finland speaking to Helsingin Sanomat , the growth experienced in this single-currency region is slow but steady. Rehn, also the Governor of the International Monetary Fund for Finland, weighed in on this progress. He warned that the stock markets are clearly in danger of a crash . His remarks highlighted the importance of banks maintaining strong capital buffers. This was after Rehn acknowledged that stock prices are high due to the rise of AI in the US, although actual economic growth and firm profits are not surging as quickly. Therefore, according to the governor, such a scenario needs them to exercise caution. In the meantime, sources mentioned that Rehn is running for the vice president of the ECB, with support from Finnish Finance Minister Riikka Purra. On the other hand, Latvia, a member of the European Central Bank system, has announced that it will propose a candidate for the six-member Executive Board. However, whether Martins Kazaks will be the central bank governor has not been confirmed. The euro zone’s different growth rate sparks concerns for the ECB Analysts have recently discovered that the eurozone’s economic expansion is masking a gap, with almost half of the region experiencing either no growth or contraction . This situation ignited concerns for the European Central Bank as it weighed whether more rate cuts were necessary. This finding was noted after reports released on Friday, November 14, demonstrated that output rose 0.2% in the third quarter compared to the last three months. These results sparked optimism among investors that recovery was picking up speed. However, an analysis revealed that nations accounting for 49% of the eurozone’s overall economic output did not experience any growth during this period. To support this claim, the analysis mentioned that Germany, the largest economy in Europe, and Italy both encountered no progress. According to sources, this is a problem the European Central Bank is aware of. This was after the Vice President, Luis de Guindos, said earlier this month that officials should note the different growth rates. In their meeting in September, the bank officials expressed concerns that Spain’s strong economic performance was primarily due to a rapid expansion rate, while other nations were struggling. Meanwhile, sources stated that although the central bank reduced borrowing costs eight times, this situation may not alone prompt policymakers to pursue further rate cuts. Still, it will be a consideration as they begin to view other risks to inflation, such as a possible delay in the European Union’s carbon pricing plan.

Daily trade disclosures from Friday show that the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF acquired 18,089 BitMine shares. The ARK Next Generation Internet ETF purchased an additional 34,637 shares. The ARK Innovation ETF added the largest amount at 116,681 shares. In total, ARK bought 169,407 BitMine shares on the day, an investment valued at approximately $5.83 million. Separately, ARKF bought 8,063 shares of Bullish. ARKW added 15,441 shares. ARKK acquired 52,011 more. These combined purchases amounted to 75,515 Bullish shares worth roughly $2.91 million. Buying During Market Weakness The renewed accumulation came as both stocks were hit by heavy selling pressure. Bullish closed down 6.19% at $38.48. BitMine fell nearly 6% to $34.40. Both recovered slightly in after-hours trading. ARK’s steady buying during dips has become a recurring strategy, particularly as the firm positions itself more aggressively in digital-asset-linked equities. ARK’s Expanding Crypto Acquisition Strategy This latest move follows ARK’s recent multi-day acquisition of Circle (CRCL) shares. Over two days last week, the firm purchased 542,269 Circle shares for a combined cost of roughly $46 million. The buying took place as Circle’s stock continued to decline, falling first to $86 and then to $82.30. These transactions mark ARK’s first Circle purchases since June, when the firm sold approximately 1.7 million shares at an average price of $200, generating $352 million. ARK has also continued to expand its position in BitMine. On Thursday, the firm purchased 242,347 additional BitMine shares for around $8.9 million after the stock dropped below $37. BitMine’s Leadership Shift Adds Further Attention BitMine has drawn broader market interest following its announcement of a leadership transition. The firm confirmed that Chi Tsang has replaced Jonathan Bates as CEO, and it also appointed three new independent board members. More than 3.5 million Ether — valued at over $11 billion — now sits in BitMine’s treasury. The company’s transformation from a mining-focused business to a major institutional holder of Ethereum has intensified comparisons to Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which maintains the largest Bitcoin treasury among publicly traded firms. ARK’s Long-Term Positioning in Crypto Markets ARK’s ongoing crypto-related acquisitions indicate confidence in long-term growth opportunities despite near-term volatility across digital asset markets. The firm’s activity aligns with its broader investment philosophy, which favors high-growth, high-risk innovation sectors even during downturns. Whether this accumulation continues will likely depend on how crypto-linked equities perform as broader macroeconomic conditions evolve.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-11-16 03:07:08

The difference between buying during presale versus entering after listing can be the difference between a 2× and a 200× return, which is why the search for the best crypto presale has become one of the most competitive conversations in the market. What makes this list unique is that each crypto here deserves its place, whether through explosive presale mechanics, real-world utility, institutional traction, ecosystem depth, or community momentum. And at the top is MoonBull, the only project in this lineup offering presale investors real governance power before the token even reaches exchanges. Here are the 10 best cryptos shaping the best crypto narrative this cycle. 1. MoonBull (MOBU): Join Best Crypto Presale Right Now MoonBull earns the spotlight because it is one of the rare presale tokens granting voting power (1 token = 1 vote) during the presale stages. While most early-stage tokens ask investors to wait until after launch before governance is enabled, MoonBull flips this model by offering community decision-making from the earliest phases. This means holders can influence pressing topics like liquidity deployment, staking rates, treasury usage, strategic partnerships, token burns, feature releases, and community incentives. The presale itself is also structured for value acceleration – currently in Stage 6 at $0.00008388, MoonBull has already raised more than $600K and built a holder base of over 2,000 participants. With a listing price of $0.00616, Stage 6 buyers are positioned for a potential ROI of over 7,244%, while early-stage entrants have already secured returns of more than 235% based on tier progression alone. User Benefits of Voting Power Voting Power transforms investors from passive speculators into active governors of the ecosystem. Large holders gain proportionate influence in decision-making, while smaller holders still participate in shaping future updates. This keeps developers accountable, aligns long-term incentives, and creates a democratic feedback loop that helps prevent centralization of control. For users, this fosters trust, transparency, and community cohesion – traits that strengthen token value long after launch. MoonBull stands out among the best crypto presale opportunities for offering investors early influence, robust tokenomics, and a fast-growing community ahead of its listing. 2. Solana (SOL): The Chain Dominating High-Speed Crypto Activity Solana continues to rank among the most powerful blockchain networks in the world thanks to its unmatched transaction speed, micro-fee structure, and rapidly expanding ecosystem. While not a presale token, Solana makes this list because the majority of successful presales in the past two years have launched on SOL, leveraging its high throughput and cost efficiency. From NFTs to gaming to high-frequency DeFi, Solana has become a magnet for developers seeking reliable performance. Its daily active users consistently rival Ethereum and BNB Chain, and its thriving ecosystem supports some of the most hyped new launches. For investors hunting presale opportunities, SOL exposure ensures participation in one of the richest early-stage pipelines in the industry. Its performance in high-volume markets and institutional-level integrations continues to reinforce Solana as a core asset behind the presale economy. 3. BullZilla (BZIL): The Meme-Utility Ecosystem Built for Long-Term Expansion BullZilla earns its placement because it’s one of the few meme-ecosystem projects evolving beyond pure speculation. Built with a combination of meme culture, gamified staking, NFTs, and expanding community tools, BullZilla appeals to investors who want presale-style upside without lacking ecosystem structure. Its development roadmap includes play-to-earn integrations, membership benefits, and reward systems that encourage long-term holding over quick flips. Unlike typical meme coins that depend solely on hype cycles, BullZilla’s approach ties user engagement to growth, creating a more durable utility loop. Its strong social presence also positions it well during bullish meme seasons, while the utility framework provides resilience during corrections. This balanced approach places BullZilla firmly among the more promising early-stage crypto plays. 4. La Culex (CULEX): The Access-Utility Hybrid With Expanding Community Tools La Culex is increasingly recognized for its hybrid design: part utility token, part access token, part community-growth engine. Its ecosystem provides tools, gated content, platform functions, and user-driven features that increase demand as the community scales. The reason La Culex earns a spot in the best crypto presale lineup is its focus on user empowerment. Holders gain access to unique resources across community platforms, creating natural demand pressure and reducing the reliance on hype alone. The team continues expanding application layers, positioning La Culex as a project designed for long-term relevance rather than speculative pumps. As more utility layers roll out, the token becomes increasingly attractive to utility-first investors. 5. Apeing (APEING): Whitelist-Only Early Entry With Rapid Viral Momentum Apeing arrives on this list because its whitelist phase has already shown significant early traction, with demand outpacing allocation windows. Whitelist stages often produce the best risk-to-reward ratios, as supply is deliberately limited to early supporters rather than the open market. Apeing’s branding and community execution are built for virality; fast-paced social campaigns, momentum-driven launches, and token distribution mechanics that attract early-stage hunters. This is a high-energy meme ecosystem, and whitelist participants are positioned for favorable entry once Apeing transitions into its public phase. Its momentum, scarcity-driven whitelist access, and strong social footprint combine to justify its inclusion among the best crypto whitelist opportunities right now. 6. Avalanche (AVAX): The Custom Blockchain Network for Scalable Growth Avalanche has become a cornerstone network for enterprise blockchain solutions thanks to its subnets: custom blockchain environments that can operate independently while maintaining the security of the Avalanche network. AVAX earns its placement because investors increasingly seek ecosystems capable of long-term application hosting, and Avalanche excels in this regard. Its developer-friendly architecture, speed, and reliability make it a go-to choice for Web3 applications seeking scalable infrastructure. Institutional integrations and sustained ecosystem growth solidify AVAX as a long-term utility backbone for early-stage projects. 7. Ripple (XRP): The Global Liquidity and Payment Rail XRP remains one of the most adopted digital assets for cross-border payments, institutional liquidity solutions, and remittance systems. With regulatory clarity improving across major jurisdictions, XRP now faces fewer legal threats than in previous years, making it a safer diversification option for a growth-focused portfolio. XRP earns its spot because macro demand for global payment rails continues rising, and XRP’s technology is already years ahead of competitors in speed, cost, and adoption. While it won’t offer upside, its stability and utility make it an anchoring asset for strategic balance. 8. Hyperliquid (HYPER): The High-Engagement Early-Stage Breakout Candidate HYPER is building momentum rapidly due to its community-first approach, aggressive branding strategy, and early-stage positioning. Its utility is still unfolding, but its virality and user-acquisition growth have put it in the conversation among leading new projects. The token makes this list because community traction is one of the strongest predictors of success. HYPER shows all the early signals, fast follower growth, coordinated engagement, meme-driven content velocity, and active investor discussions. Early signals often precede explosive listing moments, making HYPER a high-risk, high-reward contender. 9. Monero: Privacy and Stability Monero focuses on privacy in a way few other cryptocurrencies can match. It protects transaction details using ring signatures, stealth addresses, and confidential amounts, keeping the sender, receiver, and value hidden from public view. This design attracts users who want financial autonomy without exposing their activity to outside tracking. The project maintains a steady position in the market, trading at 320.15 dollars, with a market cap of 5.9 billion dollars and a circulating supply of 18.44 million XMR. Its ongoing development is driven by an active community that maintains upgrades, audits, and research without relying on a central team. Monero’s commitment to privacy continues to draw both supporters and critics, yet its purpose remains clear. It delivers a currency that behaves like digital cash, offering confidentiality by default rather than as an optional feature. This makes it a consistent choice for users who value security and independence 10. Bitcoin Cash (BCH): The Fast, Low-Fee Transaction Engine Bitcoin Cash earns its place for its reliability in fast, low-cost transactions. It has seen renewed traction as payment adoption grows worldwide. While BCH is not an early-stage play like MoonBull or Apeing, its transaction efficiency and merchant-friendly model make it a dependable asset for diversifying crypto investment portfolios. Its steady growth and consistent community support allow investors to pair speculative positions with practical blockchain utility. Conclusion Based on the latest research and market trends, MoonBull stands as the most compelling early-stage opportunity, not simply because it’s in presale, but because it offers governance that begins before launch, Ethereum-backed reliability, and a community structure designed for long-term participation. SOL, AVAX, XRP, XMR, and BCH provide essential stability and utility; BullZilla, La Culex, Apeing, and HYPER deliver narrative-driven upside. But among them, MoonBull is the only one giving presale investors direct influence, structural advantages, and exponential-stage pricing. For anyone searching for the best crypto presale positioned for both early access and meaningful ecosystem power, MoonBull leads this cycle decisively.
