Pysh’s diagnosis is not about a sudden loss of conviction from long-term holders, but about market-structure dynamics introduced by sophisticated “fast-money” firms that are designed to suppress volatility while extracting basis and funding premia. Why Is Bitcoin Not Rising Much Higher? Brunell framed the dilemma bluntly, asking why spot Bitcoin has gone sideways despite momentum from “the Trump administration” and “all these corporate treasury companies buying,” and who is “really on the sell side” creating headwinds for “$150k and $200k” targets people still float for year-end. Pysh began with empathy for that dissonance: “I definitely can feel the frustration and the pain because like it just feels like every day there’s another announcement of, oh, so and so company just bought ten thousand plus bitcoin. The price was down on the day or whatever.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Strong In ‘Wall Of Worry’, Path To $183,000 Remains Open – Analyst From there, he pointed to the rise of delta-neutral, volatility-harvesting strategies run by major Wall Street trading houses. “If I was going to guess what I think it is, I think that you have fast money Wall Street traders—Jane Street to kind of name one actor and there’s many of them out there—that… are in the business of sucking volatility out of the market and really not having any exposure, other than they’re going long and short simultaneously and they’re arbitraging the difference.” In practice, these trades pair spot, futures, and perpetual swaps so the desk is directionally flat while clipping the spread. The second-order effect, Pysh argued, is visible on the chart: “It’s going to make that volatility continue to collapse as it’s going up… the volatility is getting further and further dampened in that process.” That suppression, he continued, changes how an uptrend feels. Instead of the typical explosive expansions that have historically punctuated Bitcoin bull markets, price action compresses into narrower bands, punctuated by mean-reversion. “Where I think it takes you is this scenario where the spring is coiling and it kind of pops one way or the other,” he said. Directionally, the multi-cycle trend still points higher, but he resisted the lazy inference that a textbook volatility squeeze must resolve vertically. “Markets are highly dependent on liquidity… They’re dependent on all these other external factors… I’m not… saying the volatility is collapsing, it’s going up and we’re going to… the moon. I’m not saying that.” Related Reading: Bitcoin To $15 Million Possible Once Powell Is Out, Says Arthur Hayes Liquidity, in Pysh’s framework, is the gating variable that determines whether a coiled spring actually releases to the upside. He watches global risk proxies as a read-through for fiat liquidity rather than confining analysis to crypto-native flows. “When I’m looking at the liquidity metrics of just global equity is a great way I like to… view… I’ll look at all the global equity markets and if they’re all ripping, that’s telling me that the markets are flush with liquidity—fiat liquidity. And right now that’s what we’re seeing… they’re all like bidding. So to me, that’s a healthy indicator that Bitcoin could go higher. But it also is dependent on whether that, whatever the source of that is, continues to persist.” Feels like the most bearish bull market in Bitcoin. What has been putting the sell pressure on btc? https://t.co/9EUuLJnerH pic.twitter.com/vPvpimm7rX — Natalie Brunell ⚡️ (@natbrunell) August 23, 2025 Even so, Pysh cautioned against treating volatility compression as a deterministic countdown to six-figure price targets. “People just have to be careful… none of this is a guarantee that it’s going to continue to rip or that compression is signaling that we’re going to $200k in weeks.” He also acknowledged that, if one still subscribes to the four-year halving cadence, this leg looks different from prior cycles. “We’ve maybe seen a little bit of what we’ve seen, which is this dampening of what we have historically seen in the price action… At this part of the cycle… you would have seen a very aggressive move kind of already taking place and… to be honest with you, back… Christmas time frame I would have guessed by now,” he admitted, trailing off as if to concede that the expected vertical expansion simply hasn’t materialized on schedule. At press time, BTC traded at $111,484.

This move signals a growing trend of traditional companies venturing deeper into the world of digital assets. Sequans aims to raise a substantial $200 million to expand its Bitcoin holdings, building on its existing stash of 3,072 BTC. What’s Driving This Bold Sequans Bitcoin Purchase ? Sequans Communications announced an at-the-market (ATM) equity program, a financial strategy allowing the company to sell new shares directly into the market over time. The primary goal for this capital raise is explicitly to fund the purchase of more Bitcoin. This decision highlights a clear conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value. Strategic Allocation: Companies often diversify their treasury reserves to hedge against inflation and seek growth opportunities beyond traditional investments. Market Confidence: A move of this scale suggests Sequans views Bitcoin as a legitimate and valuable asset for corporate balance sheets. Understanding the Strategy: Why a Sequans Bitcoin Purchase Now? Many corporations are increasingly looking at Bitcoin as a strategic asset. The digital currency offers a decentralized alternative to fiat money, potentially providing a hedge against currency debasement and offering significant upside potential. Sequans’ existing holding of 3,072 BTC, reported as of July 28, demonstrates prior confidence in the asset. This new initiative to acquire more Bitcoin suggests a reinforced belief in its role within their financial strategy. Moreover, it reflects a broader institutional embrace of cryptocurrencies. The Broader Impact of Sequans’ Crypto Ambitions This substantial Sequans Bitcoin purchase could send a powerful signal to other technology companies and traditional investors. When a Nasdaq-listed semiconductor firm commits such significant capital to Bitcoin, it lends further credibility to the cryptocurrency as a viable investment. However, such a strategy is not without its challenges: Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its price swings, which can impact a company’s balance sheet in the short term. Regulatory Landscape: The evolving regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies can introduce uncertainties for corporate holders. Despite these considerations, the move by Sequans showcases a calculated risk, betting on Bitcoin’s future appreciation and its role as a store of value. What Does This Mean for the Future of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings? The trend of institutional adoption, exemplified by companies like MicroStrategy and now Sequans, continues to reshape the crypto landscape. This Sequans Bitcoin purchase reinforces the idea that digital assets are becoming a more accepted part of corporate finance. This development could inspire more companies to explore similar strategies, further integrating cryptocurrencies into mainstream financial systems. It also provides a compelling example of how diverse industries are finding value in Bitcoin beyond its original use cases. In conclusion, Sequans Communications’ plan to raise $200 million for a substantial Sequans Bitcoin purchase is a noteworthy event. It underscores the growing confidence in Bitcoin among publicly traded companies and highlights the ongoing institutional shift towards digital assets. This bold step by a semiconductor firm could very well pave the way for more corporate entities to follow suit, further solidifying Bitcoin’s position in the global financial arena. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is an at-the-market (ATM) equity program? An ATM equity program allows a publicly traded company to sell new shares of its stock directly into the open market over a period of time, typically at prevailing market prices. It’s a flexible way to raise capital. 2. Why are companies like Sequans buying Bitcoin? Companies buy Bitcoin for various reasons, including hedging against inflation, diversifying treasury assets, seeking potential long-term capital appreciation, and demonstrating an innovative approach to corporate finance. 3. What are the main risks involved in a corporate Bitcoin purchase? The primary risks include Bitcoin’s price volatility, which can lead to significant fluctuations in a company’s asset value, and the evolving regulatory landscape surrounding cryptocurrencies, which could impact future holdings. 4. How much Bitcoin did Sequans Communications hold prior to this announcement? As of July 28, Sequans Communications held 3,072 BTC, according to their press release. 5. Will this move by Sequans encourage other semiconductor firms to buy Bitcoin? While not guaranteed, a high-profile move like Sequans’ substantial Bitcoin purchase could certainly encourage other companies, particularly within the tech sector, to evaluate similar investment strategies for their treasury reserves.

Galaxy, Jump, Multicoin Are In Talks Over New Solana Treasury As reported by Bloomberg , Galaxy Digital, Jump Crypto, and Multicoin Capital are looking to raise funds to accumulate $1 billion in Solana. The three intend to acquire a publicly traded entity, the identity of which is yet unknown, to create a digital asset treasury company. The names involved here are all big in their respective corners. Galaxy Digital, led by CEO Michael Novogratz , manages about $9 billion in assets and has long positioned itself as a bridge between traditional finance and digital assets. Jump Crypto is the Web3 development arm of Jump Trading, a firm with a focus on high-frequency trading strategies. The company is working on Firedancer , a new validator client for Solana aimed at boosting the network’s resilience and transaction capabilities. Multicoin Capital is a thesis-driven investment firm that invests in cryptocurrencies and blockchain companies. Notably, it has been a backer of SOL and its ecosystem since the early days. The three firms have hired Cantor Fitzgerald LP as lead banker for the deal, according to the report. The effort has also won endorsement from the Solana Foundation and could be finalized in early September. This is the latest example of companies exploring digital asset treasuries. Michael Saylor-led Strategy (formerly Microstrategy) popularized the idea with its Bitcoin accumulation, and today, not just BTC, but also altcoins are making their way to the balance sheets of firms. If the $1 billion plan goes through, Galaxy and company would have created the largest treasury for Solana. At present, Upexi is the leading SOL treasury with about $400 million in holdings. SOL Price Has Slipped Below $200 After Latest Decline The cryptocurrency market has seen a shock during the past day, and Solana hasn’t been spared as its price has gone down by around 3%. Over the weekend, the coin had managed to surpass $210, but this drawdown has meant the asset is back at $197. Below is a chart that shows how the asset’s recent performance has looked. While SOL has witnessed this drawdown, it’s holding onto a chunk of its recent gains, which means it remains the best performer among the top coins with a weekly return of more than 8%. That said, the decline may have changed things from a technical analysis perspective. Earlier, analyst Ali Martinez shared a chart showcasing the beginning of a potential breakout for SOL’s 12-hour price from an ascending triangle pattern. The price retrace has now meant that the coin is back inside the consolidation channel, possibly canceling out the bullish signal.",Solana|Galaxy|Jump|Multicoin|SOL|solana|Solana Treasury|SOLUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-25 23:00:22

Bitcoin fell below $113,000, pulling altcoins lower yet traders are now turning toward Solana, XRP and MAGACOIN FINANCE as they look for fresh entry points. Bitcoin Dip Reframes Market Focus Bitcoin dropped 2.94% over 24 hours to $112,936 which marks its weakest level in two weeks. The decline triggered $113 million in liquidations and amplified tension about whether the latest bull cycle can hold. Despite a 5.46% weekly loss Bitcoin remains up 86% year-to-date. As the flagship coin is under pressure attention has shifted to altcoins where demand in presale markets is running hotter than ever. Solana Buyers Are Eyeing New Push Solana price slipped from a recent peak of $210 down to $179, which is a 15.5% fall. While short-term traders say this is a possible warning sign, on-chain data tells a different story. Solana continues to dominate exchange activity by recording $111.5 billion in 30-day volumes, which is more than the combined activity of Ethereum layer-2 networks. The total value locked on Solana rose to $12.1 billion to extend its lead over BNB Chain . Decentralized apps like Jupiter and Raydium each surpassed $2 billion in deposits, which means there is consistent demand across the network. Solana also generated $35.6 million in fees over the past month, a growth rate that outpaced rivals despite its lower cost structure. Open interest on SOL futures surged to $10.7 billion, up from $6.9 billion just two months ago. Coupled with exchange-traded products holding $2.8 billion in exposure, buyers are preparing for the next leg higher. XRP Stabilizes After Drop Below $3 XRP briefly dipped under $3 this week to hit $2.94 before recovering back to $2.96. The move aligned with a broader sell-off, yet analysts believe this action may have marked a market bottom. Market watchers highlight the $2.9 level as a critical floor, one that could form the base for another rally. Some analysts are pointing to $4.80 as the next “logical” upside target if sentiment continues to recover. The resilience at this level positions XRP as a key asset to watch especially as traders look beyond Bitcoin for clearer paths forward. MAGACOIN FINANCE is Also Extending Presale Appeal While Solana and XRP command headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining traction in presale markets. Built on a security-first framework and already backed by multiple audits, the altcoin has raised significant capital during its ongoing presale. A PATRIOT50X bonus code is currently active, giving buyers a 50% extra allocation during this phase. Its traction has been boosted by steady market pullbacks which often shift trader attention toward early-stage tokens. With listings in the near term, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing interest from those looking for altcoin exposure outside the volatility of larger caps. What Should Traders Do Next? With Bitcoin struggling to hold above $113,000, the market focus is shifting to altcoins offering stability and new entry points. Solana, XRP, and MAGACOIN FINANCE all fit that narrative, each attracting buyers despite the dip. Traders looking to position early may want to move quickly — MAGACOIN’s presale, in particular, continues to build demand, and the bonus code PATRIOT50X won’t last forever.

That framing isn’t accidental. Projects like Rollblock lean directly into it, tying their fortunes to the gambling industry itself. With an AI-driven GambleFi casino and sportsbook, the Rollblock presale has raised $11.4 million, promising staking yields up to 30% APY, revenue sharing, rakebacks, and even token burns to keep the house profitable. But presales aren’t just about thrill. They’re also about proof, proof that a network can attract real users, capital, and infrastructure before it ever lists. That’s where BlockDAG (BDAG) pulls the narrative in a very different direction. The figures are stark: $383 million raised across 29 batches, more than 25.3 billion coins sold, and early backers from Batch 1 already seeing 2,660% ROI. $11.4M Rollblock Presale: The Gamble on GambleFi The casino industry has always been a magnet for disruption stories. Rollblock is leaning into that narrative with its AI-driven GambleFi ecosystem, a crypto casino and sportsbook that promises instant deposits, fast withdrawals, and over 12,000 games. The pitch is straightforward: buy $RBLK now at $0.068, and get rewarded later with profit-sharing, token burns, staking up to 30% APY, and even rakebacks when you play. So far, the Rollblock presale has pulled in $11.4 million, an impressive number in the crowded iGaming market. Much of the community is now speculating that the Rollblock launch date will be paired with exchange listings, a moment that could determine whether the project’s early presale traction converts into lasting growth. The model is designed to keep both players and token holders engaged, but the entire structure still lives and dies by gambling revenue, and whether the Rollblock presale can keep chips on the table long enough to scale. $383M BlockDAG Presale: Profits Without the Roulette Wheel Where Rollblock talks about reshaping casinos, BlockDAG has quietly been reshaping blockchain itself with its directed acyclic graph (DAG) and Proof of Work (PoW) structure. With $383 million raised across 29 presale batches, 25.3 billion coins sold, and ROI hitting 2,660% for early participants, it has turned what should be a speculative phase into a solid profit engine. At today’s $0.0276, the chatter isn’t about whether BDAG’s price will rise, but how far. Analysts peg near-term valuations at $1 to $5, with longer horizons stretching to $10 or even $20. That kind of upside transforms BlockDAG from “just another presale” into a magnet for whales and retail buyers alike. Adoption Goes Into Overdrive: Millions Join BlockDAG’s Ecosystem BlockDAG’s X1 Miner app has onboarded over 2.5 million users, turning smartphones into gateways for mining BDAG. Hardware sales have crossed 19,400 units, adding $7.8 million to the project’s revenue stack. 200,000 holders are already locked in, alongside 4,500 developers pushing forward more than 300 projects. To make things even more tangible, the rollout of the Demo Dashboard V4 gives holders a first-hand feel of what BDAG trading will look like. Add in confirmed listings on 20 exchanges, and the path to liquidity is already secured before the network even goes live. This is what makes BlockDAG different: presales are usually about “what could be.” Here, the ROI, the users, and the infrastructure already show “what is.” Decision Time: BlockDAG or Rollblock Presale? On the surface, Rollblock and BlockDAG both look like high-energy presales built for this cycle. The Rollblock presale is pushing the GambleFi angle hard, with $11.4 million raised on the promise of casino revenue sharing. It’s fun, it’s flashy, but it’s ultimately betting on players showing up and staying loyal even after the Rollblock launch date and exchange debut arrive. BlockDAG, meanwhile, isn’t asking you to gamble on user behavior. It has already shown the receipts: $383 million raised, 25.3 billion coins sold, millions of users, and thousands of builders in motion. Throw in the early ROI of 2,660%, plus exchange listings and profit predictions climbing into double digits, and the difference becomes clear. One project is trying to keep people spinning slot machines. The other is already proving it can mint profits at scale. In this presale cycle, that’s the real jackpot.

Polygon, Aptos, and Dogecoin are experiencing new volumes, whereas Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche remain resilient. However, one name drawing smart money attention is MAGACOIN FINANCE, which analysts say could deliver one of the biggest returns in this cycle . Polygon (MATIC) Polygon is a scaling solution on Ethereum, aimed at reducing Ethereum gas fees and the Ethereum block time. Its ecosystem is growing, and the migration of tokens of MATIC to POL will strengthen the standing. Technicals suggest potential upside—RSI is oversold near 38, and MACD shows bearish momentum slowing. Resistance is at around $0.58, and support levels are at around $0.33. Analysts predict a price range of between $3.84 and $6.25 by 2025, powered by an Ethereum upgrade and Bitcoin halving. In the long term, Polygon may go as high as $8.55 to $10.40 by 2030 should it continue to gain adoption. Aptos (APT) Aptos is a new Layer-1 blockchain focused on high throughput and speed. It has gained traction with developers. However, the adoption of the coin is still in the early phase. Depending on the development of its ecosystem, analysts project that Aptos may trade between $25 and $35 by 2025. Some investors view APT as a potential high-growth bet in the event that network usage swells. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin remains the biggest meme coin, supported by its community and regular bursts of hype. It doesn’t have strong utility compared to other networks, but liquidity and recognition keep it relevant. The price often finds support between $0.05 and $0.07 and often rallies when sentiment improves. For 2025, analysts see it trading between $0.08 and $0.15, though much depends on social media buzz and endorsements. DOGE remains a speculative pick, but its track record of sudden rallies keeps it on whale watchlists. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum is the foundation for the decentralized applications, DeFi, and NFTs. Its increasing upgrades make it more scalable with low energy consumption, which maintains its appeal among developers and institutions. In the past, Ethereum has been quite successful in bull markets, and experts believe that it will be trading between 4,000 and 6,000 by the year 2025. The long-term need in enterprise scenarios and the increasing DeFi community provide ETH with a solid foundation. It is an essential part of the portfolios of many investors who are constructing long-term cryptocurrency investments. Solana (SOL) Solana has also been widely celebrated as a platform that offers quick transactions and minimal fees, making it a popular platform among DeFi and NFTs. Past outages in the network have been a cause of concern, but stability has been improved, and investors are more confident. It has a support level of between $20 and $30 and a resistance level of up to $90. Depending on network reliability and macro market trends, analysts estimate SOL will range between $60 and $90 in 2025. Its developing community indicates Solana can be a strong altcoin moving forward Avalanche (AVAX) Avalanche is creating traction in DeFi and enterprise blockchain. Its scalability and its fast finality make it appealing to developers. Support is at about $20 to $30, and resistance is at about $75. Analysts predict between $50 and $75 by 2025 in case the adoption grows higher. With the increasing popularity of DeFi, Avalanche will emerge as a favorable option when other projects seek faster and scalable solutions. MAGACOIN FINANCE—Whale Activity Signals Smart Money Confidence in 45x Outlook Whale activity is starting to build around MAGACOIN FINANCE, indicating an increasing level of confidence in its long-term potential by intelligent money. Analysts have predicted up to 45x growth, making MAGA one of the most discussed altcoins in this dip. Unlike meme coins that solely rely on hype, MAGA has undergone audit processes , which further increase the credibility of the project among skeptical investors. It’s drawing attention not only from retail buyers but also from larger wallets that are typically more selective. That combination has created a wave of curiosity around whether MAGA could be the next breakout coin of this market cycle. Final Outlook The market dip is giving investors a chance to pick up strong altcoins at lower levels. Polygon, Aptos, Dogecoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche all have growth potential, but whale activity is pointing strongly toward MAGACOIN FINANCE. With forecasts of 45x growth and rising confidence from large investors, MAGA is quickly becoming the altcoin many are watching as the top play of this cycle .

Analysts believe so. The project has unveiled its Q3 2025 beta wallet launch, which will allow instant crypto-to-bank transfers in over 30 countries, with support for 40+ cryptocurrencies and multiple fiat options. This makes RTX one of the few tokens tackling a real-world payments problem rather than relying on hype. Key reasons investors are buying into Remittix include: Over $21 million raised and 618M+ tokens sold Confirmed BitMart listing to boost liquidity Q3 wallet beta launch with low gas fee transfers CertiK-audited security for transparency Designed to disrupt a $19 trillion remittance market This Could Be the Presale That Changes Everything: Remittix is drawing comparisons to XRP’s early days but with infrastructure ready before launch, making it a top contender for those seeking the next 100x crypto . Solana (SOL) Outlook in 2025 Solana currently trades near $175 and has strong momentum heading into the fall. Analysts suggest a rally toward $250 is achievable if institutional inflows continue, especially with DeFi and NFT activity returning to the network. Its high throughput blockchain and ecosystem resilience remain key strengths. Source: TradingView However, despite Solana’s upside, its growth ceiling is more limited compared to RTX. Established large-cap tokens like SOL may deliver 50%–80% returns, but they are unlikely to match the projected 50x growth analysts forecast for Remittix. For investors evaluating the best crypto presale for 2025 , SOL offers stability while RTX provides early-stage exponential potential. Final Thoughts Both Solana and Remittix offer unique opportunities. Solana could extend its rally toward $250 in 2025, appealing to those seeking safer bets. Meanwhile, Remittix is positioning itself as the dark horse altcoin, with real-world adoption drivers, an upcoming wallet launch, and a confirmed exchange listing — all fueling projections of $5+ by 2026. For those seeking the best crypto to buy now , Remittix may hold the sharper edge in terms of growth.

According to reporting from CNBC, the freeze is tied to former President Donald Trump’s executive order that officially ends the de minimis exemption for foreign packages valued under $800. The order affects every country, not just China, and takes effect this Friday. Shipments under that threshold had entered the U.S. without customs duties or detailed clearance procedures for over a century. That ends now. Nine countries (Germany, Spain, France, Belgium, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Switzerland) are pausing outbound U.S. deliveries as a result. Their systems can’t keep up with the new rules, and carriers don’t know how the customs fees will be calculated, who collects them, or how to transmit that info to U.S. authorities. DHL, Correos, and La Poste freeze mail as confusion spreads DHL issued a statement on Friday confirming that Deutsche Post and DHL Parcel Germany have stopped taking parcels bound for the U.S. “Key questions remain unresolved,” the company said, “particularly regarding how and by whom customs duties will be collected in the future, what additional data will be required, and how the data transmission to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection will be carried out.” The only option left is DHL Express, which still operates but costs a lot more. Correos, the national postal service of Spain, said in a statement that it only received the full compliance requirements from U.S. authorities on August 15. “This situation forces Correos, along with all postal operators that manage shipments destined for the United States, to substantially modify their processes and increase shipment controls to implement the new customs requirements, significantly impacting international postal logistics and e-commerce flows,” the agency said. The freeze began Monday, with no timeline for when it’ll lift. Belgium’s national carrier said its pause would begin on Saturday, and France’s La Poste said it would suspend U.S. shipments starting Monday. Over in the north, Finland’s Posti stopped shipping to the U.S. last Saturday. A few days later, they said they couldn’t even process gifts or letters anymore because, in their words, “several airlines have now refused to transport any postal items to the United States.” The suspension mostly affects shipments below $800. Items like letters and gifts were initially excluded, but that’s no longer the case in some countries. Airlines backing out of transport agreements are adding even more pressure to already-strained postal systems. Small European businesses feel the blow first The sudden pause is expected to hit Europe’s smaller exporters the hardest. Americans who shop directly from small European sellers, not big-name retailers, are the ones caught in the middle. Most large companies, especially those with operations in the U.S., don’t use de minimis to begin with. They ship goods in bulk containers to U.S. warehouses and pay tariffs. But platforms like Temu and Shein, which leaned heavily on de minimis, saw major price spikes and weaker demand once the China exemption ended back in May. Now, with Europe losing the same benefit, a similar impact is likely for sellers using standard mail. None of the countries gave a firm restart date. All said the suspensions are temporary. But the problem isn’t just bureaucracy. It’s tech. None of their current postal systems were designed to track new U.S. customs requirements or deliver detailed parcel data to American officials. Even if their tech catches up, the bigger question is who pays the customs fees and how they’ll be collected. No one has that answer; not the carriers, not the postal offices, and not the airlines refusing the cargo.

SharpLink Gaming (SBET) offers leveraged, compounding exposure to ETH-USD through active treasury management, staking, and capital raises at market value. SBET's strategy may generate asymmetric upside versus direct ETH-USD ownership, but carries dilution and regulatory risks tied to aggressive fundraising and crypto regulation. With ETH's ecosystem poised for growth and SBET trading near NAV, I see SBET as a high-potential play for outsized returns as ETH adoption accelerates. I have been very public about my stance on Ethereum (ETH-USD) since The Genius Act was signed into law. I have been establishing a position in ETH-USD directly while gaining indirect exposure through ETF-USD based treasuries. As the landscape continues to evolve with digital assets SharpLink Gaming ( SBET ) was one of the first companies listed on the Nasdaq to a treasury strategy centered around ETH-USD. I believe that SBET could be an under the radar gem that will experience explosive growth as investors focus on treasuries such as Bitmine Immersion Technologies ( BMNR ) since Tom Lee from Fundstrat is now their chairman. ETH is back to it’s 2021 highs while Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has rallied by over 80% since the end of 2021 and I think there is a huge opportunity in ETH as the adoption of stablecoins emerges. From Robinhood ( HOOD ) to Palantir ( PLTR ) many companies have more than doubled over the past year leaving limited opportunities for outsized growth. While owning ETH-USD provides direct access to it’s price appreciation and staking yields, I believe SBET offers several potential advantages for investors seeking leveraged upside and strategic growth opportunities. SBET is able to raise capital through at-the-market ((ATM)) offerings and convertible notes to acquire more ETH at a lower effective cost than direct purchases. I believe that SEBT will generate asymmetric upside as it’s ETH-USD/share growth model could outpace direct ownership of ETH-USD if management executes on its strategy. Seeking Alpha Risks to investing in SBET While I am bullish on ETH-USD and SBET there are significant risks that investors should consider before allocating capital toward SEBT. SBET’s share price is correlated to the performance of ETH-USD as it’s a leveraged proxy for ETH-USD. SBET funds it’s ETH-USD purchases through ATM offerings and equity issuances which can be aggressive at times that can lead to large amounts of dilution. SBET has recently increased its ATM sales agreement by $5 billion, which may amplify the gains when ETH-USD moves higher but in periods of downward declines shares of SBET are likely to move significantly lower. SBET also faces evolving regulations around digital assets, stablecoins, and decentralized finance ((DeFi)). Making money on SBET depends on the adoption of ETH-USD’s underlying utility for smart contracts, tokenization, and a shift to stablecoins. If digitalization through DeFi doesn’t take off then the use case for ETH-USD could be severely impacted. Investors need the utility for ETH-USD to be scaled throughout different ecosystems as BTC-USD is already looked at as the store of value in the crypto space. Investors should do their own due diligence because there are many factors to consider when entering the crypto space through an ETH-USD treasury such as SBET. Seeking Alpha Why I am bullish on ETH-USD at this point in time and not BTC-USD BTC-USD and ETH-USD are the two largest cryptocurrencies and while BTC-USD has a vastly larger market cap than ETH-USD I don’t believe BTC-USD has anywhere near the utility that ETH-USD has. BTC-USD is often referred to as digital gold and looked at as a store of value but ETH-USD powers a vast programmable blockchain platform enabling decentralized applications ((dApps)), smart contracts, and more. While BTC-USD is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system with a fixed supply cap of 21 million coins using Proof-of-Work ((PoW)) for security, ETH-USD has taken the other side as it has an uncapped but deflationary supply mechanism via burning fees. This allows ETH-USD to host ecosystems like Layer 2 solutions while BTC-USD relies on sidechains like Lightning Network for faster transactions. ETH-USD is a programable blockchain for smart contracts and dApps and serves as the digital oil for fueling these economies. The gas for network fees in dApps enables tokenized payments, stablecoins and automated settlements in DeFi protocols which helps decrease the overall supply of ETH-USD with each transaction. Sharplink Gaming The open-source blockchain platform through ETH-USD is decentralized and allows the end users to create and execute smart contracts and dApps. Intermediaries like banks or governments aren’t needed for the transactions as the peer-to-peer network where participants maintain a shared ledger of transactions is managed through the ETH-USD network. The smart contract aspect is a self-executing program stored on the blockchain that automatically runs when predefined conditions are met, which can include transferring funds or executing trades. BTC-USD doesn’t have this level of utility which is why I believe the majority of stablecoins will be built on ETH-USD’s layer 2 ecosystem as they are designed to maintain a consistent value and bridge traditional finance and crypto by enabling fast, low-cost transactions while preserving stability. ETH-USD was built with the focus of digitization as it allows stablecoins to be programmed with automated mechanisms for maintaining their peg, such as collateralization, algorithmic adjustments, or reserves managed via decentralized autonomous organizations through its smart contract system. If BTC-USD was a better system to achieve these goals then I believe USDC , which is issued by Circle ( CRCL ), would have been built around BTC-USD’s framework rather than ETH-USD’s. President Trumps working group on digital assets has positioned the United States to be a leader in digital finance technology as they are looking to provide framework so the golden age of Crypto can be unleashed. A lot can be accomplished in a short period of time and if modernization of banking regulation for digital assets occurs I believe the amount of value generated throughout the ETF-USD ecosystem could be immense leading to upside potential for ETH-USD directly and ETH-USD treasuries such as SBET. Why I am bullish on SBET and buying it as a play on ETH-USD Currently, ETH-USD is trading for $4,748.82 and SBET’s reported ETH-USD holdings as of 8/19 were 740,760. This places the net asset value ((NAV)) of SBET’s ETH-USD at $3.52 billion and it’s market cap is $3.52 billion which means your getting ETH-USD exposure at a 1:1 price point through SBET. The business model for SBET is to raise capital to acquire ETH, stake 100% of the ETH so it’s yield compounds and concentrate all the ETH-USD in the portfolio by wrapping it into SBET to grow the ETH-USD per share for its shareholders. Since I live in New York I can’t benefit from staking ETH directly so purchasing SBET allows me to gain exposure of an asset I am long while having its management team stake ETH-USD to grow its holdings. To date SBET has earned 1,388 ETH-USD through staking its assets and that figure will only grow and continue to compound as SBET acquires more ETH-USD. SBET offers leveraged exposure, yield optimization, and institutional-grade management without paying a premium for the underlying ETH-USD in its treasury at the current share price. Sharplink Gaming X Page I believe that SBET has the ability to generate significant upside compared to owning ETH-USD directly. When I purchase ETH-USD directly my position remains static unless I add more capital. SBET is utilizing ATM offerings and registered direct placements to raise funds from investors then converting that capital to ETH-USD. This creates a compounding effect that I couldn’t achieve on my own and as ETH-USD appreciates in value SBET’s treasury also grows in value and enables them to issue ATM offerings at higher valuations. Through SBET’s active treasury management system purchasing an ETH-USD spot ETF increased by 1.4x from 5/27 to 7/30 while SBET’s share price increased by 3.3x which made it a significantly better investment for investors bullish on ETH-USD. SBET just authorized a stock buyback program in the amount of $1.5 billion. If SBET trades at or below the NAV of the ETH-USD in its treasury issuing new equity would dilute the ETH-USD concentration but if SBET can repurchase it’s stock in that scenario it would create the opposite impact and increase the amount of ETH-USD each remaining share represented. This would allow SBET to increase the ETH concentration through every share repurchase and compound the long-term value for shareholders. Sharplink Gaming Conclusion While ETH-USD has experienced over 1,100% of appreciation since August of 2020 I believe it’s still early as there is a tremendous amount of utility throughout the ETH-USD ecosystem. I believe that ETH-USD will be tied to stablecoins and tokenized assets whereas BTC-USD will just be looked at as a store of value. The true value in ETH is the future adoption and with a crypto friendly administration paving the way for digital assets I believe that there is a massive runway for the TAM of the assets that can be built on ETH-USD. SBET is an interesting opportunity as it’s currently trading at roughly a 1:1 ratio as ETH-USD and investors can tap into their ability to stake a massive amount of ETH-USD to generate a compounding yield as more ETH-USD is generated in addition to issuing ATM offerings to expand its treasury position. Since SBET started its ETH-USD treasury strategy it has generated more than double the appreciation of a standard ETH-USD spot ETF and as ETH-USD appreciates in value SBET could generate outsized returns. Ultimately, I am so bullish on ETH-USD that I think it can overcome BTC-USD as the largest cryptocurrency and SBET could amplify those returns by a large margin due to their strategy. I recently started a position in SBET and will actively be adding to my position as ETH could be one of the most interesting investments over the next several years.

The National Assembly building in Seoul, South Korea. (Source: AnbyG [CC BY-SA 4.0]) S Korea’s Stablecoin Legislation: Stuck in Committee The bills’ delay, the newspaper wrote, is due to the fact that regulators and lawmakers cannot agree on key terms. Busan Ilbo wrote: “Discussions on institutionalizing stablecoins in South Korea are stuck at a standstill. This stems from persistent disagreements between the National Assembly, the government, and the Bank of Korea (BOK).” The outlet noted that the parties cannot agree on the question of whether they should let fintech and IT firms issue coins. More conservative voices at the BOK and in the government want to restrict issuance to domestic commercial banks. No. of bank branches shrinks 20% since pandemic, but agency banking pilot stalls https://t.co/DdjisUTR0z — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) August 24, 2025 The question of whether or not to let fintech firms issue KRW-pegged coins is extremely sensitive in South Korea. The country’s business space is dominated by large conglomerates known as chaebol . All of these firms have advanced finance and tech subsidiaries. In recent years, internet giants such as Naver and Kakao have also moved into the space. The BOK and others fear that letting firms issue KRW-pegged coins will lead to the rise of big tech-controlled “private currencies.” Historically, chaebol have wielded enormous political and financial influence in South Korea. The BOK is concerned that surrendering its monopoly on currency issuance to these firms (or new tech giants like Naver) will erode its power. Conversely, the BOK exercises considerable regulatory powers over the commercial banking space. As such, it seems ready to dig its heels in on the matter. More than 16 Korean business leaders, including the heads of the country’s four major conglomerates, will accompany President Lee Jae Myung as part of a business delegation to support the Korea-U.S. summit scheduled for Monday. https://t.co/F854pSVlxw — The Korea JoongAng Daily (@JoongAngDaily) August 25, 2025 Equity Requirements The four bills all feature varying requirements for stablecoin issuers. The most progressive of the quartet proposes ensuring issuers have a minimum of 500 million won ($360,026) in equity capital. This bill would essentially open the door to startups that wish to start issuing KRW-pegged stablecoins. But the most conservative of the bills states that only firms with a minimum of 5 billion won ($3.6 million) in equity capital can enter the market. Busan Ilbo wrote that the review process has been divided between two of the National Assembly’s committees, namely the Political Affairs Committee and the Strategy and Finance Committee.

A senior official at a South Korean blockchain industry firm, speaking to Cryptonews.com on condition of anonymity, said: “This delay is very frustrating. The government should make up its mind quickly, either way. Our rivals in other countries aren’t being left in limbo like us.” Playing Catchup with Washington South Korean critics have pointed to progress on stablecoins in Germany, China, and Japan, as well as the US.

Experts in Seoul think that Berlin, Tokyo, and Beijing are all acting in response to events in Washington; keen to avoid a “unipolar” drift toward the US dollar. US President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law in July this year. The act sets out a range of regulatory requirements for would-be stablecoin issuers. Last week, the President of the USD Coin (USDC) issuer Circle Heath Tarbert held a stablecoin-themed meeting with the BOK Governor Rhee Chang-yong .

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP continue to dominate conversations, supported by institutional inflows and strong market positioning. Yet, analysts are also pointing to a hidden presale gem — MAGACOIN FINANCE — as the play that could rival the earliest winners of past cycles. Bitcoin: The Market’s Anchor Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of the whole cryptocurrency universe. Bitcoin (BTC) is currently consolidating between $113,000 and $115,000, following a correction from its all-time high above $124,000. According to analysts, BTC continues to be the sector’s most reliable store of value. According to analysts, large corrections like this one have occurred in past halvings, and since institutional interest is still high, many are expecting further growth towards $130,000 or above later in 2025. Bitcoin remains a must-hold for investors looking for growth and stability. Ethereum: Driving Web3 Innovation Ethereum is the clear leader in web3 and decentralised finance, according to experts. Even though ETH was down in the short-term trading at about $4200, some believe that institutional inflow into the ETH ETF recently crossed 1 billion dollars. Forecasting from a technical point of view indicates that the price may move toward $5,000 soon. The first resistance is $4454, while the second one is $4702. The dominance of Ethereum’s network across DeFi, NFTs, and Layer 2 scaling makes it a core pick for investors for riding long-term adoption trends. XRP: Legal Clarity Fuels Growth XRP has staged a strong comeback after receiving the clarity it has long waited when it comes to the SEC. XRP is currently trading around $2.90, with more than 93% of its supply now in profit. Whale buying has picked up too, as major buyers accumulate hundreds of millions of tokens. Analysts think XRP might go back to $3.39 in a few months, especially with ETF speculation building in October! In the realm of crypto assets, XRP’s designation as a payment-oriented asset offers tangible and unique value. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Hidden 25,000% ROI Play Thousands of investors have already joined the wave into MAGACOIN FINANCE, with analysts forecasting a staggering 25,000% ROI in the next bull run. Ranked among the best altcoins to buy right now , momentum is accelerating quickly. Momentum is already evident. Trading activity from early buyers has surged, and social engagement continues to accelerate faster than rival launches. Research groups note that this isn’t just speculative noise — it reflects sustained conviction from both smaller investors and large holders positioning ahead of exchange listings. Analysts highlight that MAGACOIN FINANCE capped supply, verified audits, and whale-backed inflows give it the kind of fundamentals that fueled the earliest breakouts of Solana and Ethereum. If momentum continues at its current pace, MAGACOIN FINANCE could become one of the most talked-about altcoins of 2025. Conclusion Bitcoin, ETH and XRP are the three strongest candidates for investors for the coming up bull cycle owing to hefty institutional demand and strong fundamentals.

Analysts are pointing to one specific price region that could determine whether the asset stabilizes or faces further downside movement. While several major altcoins have posted significant gains over the past week, XRP’s performance has remained notably muted. Ethereum (ETH) advanced by 9.36%, Binance Coin (BNB) gained 4.73%, and Solana (SOL) increased by 11.61% in the same timeframe. In contrast, XRP recorded only a 0.08% rise, reflecting a persistent struggle to generate strong momentum. Bitcoin (BTC) has also faced similar difficulties, recently moving down to the $111,000 region . Despite the resolution of the Ripple versus SEC case and updates surrounding spot ETF applications , XRP has yet to deliver a convincing recovery. This lack of progress has drawn attention to its current support levels, which market observers consider decisive for the asset’s short-term direction. The Importance of the $2.8 Support A market analyst, presenting insights under the Joe Swanson persona, emphasized that XRP’s ability to maintain the $2.8 support level is crucial. According to his analysis, this price point represents the threshold between stability and significant downside risk. He highlighted that XRP tested this level repeatedly between August 19 and August 22, after which the asset experienced a sharp upward move of 7.81%, briefly reaching $3.1 before pulling back slightly. $XRP pulled off a strong comeback from the make-or-break $2.8 support, where bulls stepped in hard. Now holding above key EMAs, momentum looks set for a push toward $3.1–$3.5. Still, lose $2.8 & it’s game over. pic.twitter.com/CTSaNMHMXk — Joe Swanson (@Joe_Swanson057) August 24, 2025 At the time of press, XRP trades near $2.98, hovering close to this critical region. The analyst cautioned that a decline of roughly 6% from the current price would place XRP below $2.8, which, in his assessment, would invalidate its recent recovery and expose it to deeper losses. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Diverging Views from Other Analysts Although Swanson remains cautious, not all analysts share the same outlook. EGRAG Crypto has suggested that a fall below $2.8 would not necessarily end XRP’s prospects, provided it remains above $2.65 . In his view, price activity within this range is insignificant until the asset either climbs beyond $3.65 or falls below $2.65. In his assessment, crossing either boundary would define the next phase of market movement. Meanwhile, CryptoInsightUK has expressed greater optimism. He identified strong liquidity between $3.1 and $3.7, describing this area as a potential launch point for a further rally. If this momentum holds, he anticipates a move toward new highs, with projections extending above $4.2. The debate among analysts highlights the importance of the $2.8 price region as a short-term benchmark for XRP. While some see it as a decisive line that could trigger broader losses if breached, others argue that opportunities remain as long as the asset avoids a drop below $2.65. With XRP trading near $3 and struggling to match the growth of its peers, market participants are watching closely to see whether it can build on its recent rebound or face renewed downward pressure.

The potential sanctions, which could take any form, are linked to complaints that claim the DSA censors American voices and imposes significant costs on U.S. tech companies . US accuses the EU of stifling free speech According to sources cited by Reuters, Senior State Department officials are yet to make the final decision on whether to go ahead with the punitive measures that would likely come in the form of visa restrictions. For now, it is unclear which EU or EU member state officials the action would target, but sources claim US officials have been holding internal meetings on the topic since last week. Whatever the final decision is, it is likely to have a huge effect on the already frayed relationship between the Trump administration and the European Union. Citing an internal State Department cable, reports earlier this month claimed that the Trump administration has instructed U.S. diplomats in Europe to launch a lobbying campaign to build opposition to the Digital Services Act in an effort to have it amended or repealed. The EU’s DSA has been touted as a law that will make the online environment safer, partially by forcing tech giants to do more to tackle illegal content, including hate speech and child sexual abuse material. However, Washington has accused the EU of pursuing “undue” restrictions on freedom of expression with its efforts to combat hateful speech, misinformation and disinformation, and that the DSA only makes things worse. In an early-August directive, Secretary of State Marco Rubio ordered U.S. diplomats to convey the U.S. concerns about the DSA and the financial costs for U.S. companies. Before that, in May, Rubio threatened visa bans for anyone found guilty of censoring speech by Americans, including on social media, while he suggested the policy could target foreign officials regulating U.S. tech companies. Europe’s dependence on America continues to show If the potential sanctions America is now considering are enacted, it would be unprecedented and could further strain already tense EU-U.S. trade relations, which have been marked by tariff threats and contentious negotiations. The present conflicts have already confirmed how dependent the EU is on America and not just for protection. As things stand, just three US giants – Google, Microsoft and Amazon – provide 70% of Europe’s cloud-computing infrastructure, the foundation on which many online services depend. And some have questioned whether an unpredictable U.S. leader like Trump would consider weaponizing the situation if relations deteriorate even more – for example, by ordering those big tech companies to turn off their services in Europe. “Critical data would become inaccessible, websites would go dark, and essential state services like hospital IT systems would be thrown into chaos,” Robin Berjon, a digital governance specialist who advises EU policymakers, said. Berjon believes concerns over a so-called U.S. “kill switch” should be taken seriously even though Microsoft, Google and Amazon all claim they offer “sovereign” cloud computing solutions that safeguard EU clients’ data and would prevent such a scenario ever occurring. Fears of America resorting to using the alleged kill switch got even more urgent in May when rumors claimed that Karim Khan, the top prosecutor at the Netherlands-based International Criminal Court (ICC), lost access to his Microsoft Outlook email account after getting sanctioned by the White House. Microsoft claims that “at no point” did it cease or suspend its services to the ICC, although it was in touch with the ICC “throughout the process that resulted in the disconnection”. Since then, digital sovereignty has climbed to the top of the priority list in Brussels and reports claim some public bodies are already seeking alternatives to U.S. providers.

That jump followed June’s $87 billion explosion, the biggest monthly increase in margin debt ever recorded. In the last two years, borrowing has increased by $400 billion, a 67% gain that’s moving faster than the equity markets themselves. Adjusted for inflation, margin debt is still slightly below the October 2021 peak, but as a share of GDP, it’s now higher than every other peak in recent history, including the 2000’s Dot-Com era, except for that same 2021 high. The rally that’s been powering stocks is floating on borrowed money. S&P holds credit rating as deficit outlook stays messy The U.S. credit rating remains at AA+, not because things are good, but because they’re not expected to get much worse. S&P Global announced the rating reaffirmation last week, pointing to four major supports: the economy’s strength, institutional checks and balances, monetary policy that acts early, and the dollar’s dominance in global reserves. The outlook remains stable. “This incorporates our view that changes underway in domestic and international policies won’t weigh on the resilience and diversity of the U.S. economy,” said S&P analysts in a statement. S&P also said that “broad revenue buoyancy, including robust tariff income, will offset any fiscal slippage from tax cuts and spending increases.” The phrase “fiscal slippage” refers directly to President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which added new tax cuts and reshuffled federal spending, including cuts to some programs and increases to others. The net effect? Trillions of dollars in additional deficit spending over the coming decade. But S&P is counting on Trump’s tariffs to fill that hole. The Congressional Budget Office agrees, for now. They estimate that tariff revenues will subtract trillions from the expected deficits. Analysts see between $300 billion to $400 billion a year coming in through levies. S&P expects the deficit to drop to 6% of GDP between 2025 and 2028, down from 7.5% in 2024, which already improved from the 9.8% average between 2020 and 2023. Still, overall debt levels are expected to rise past the previous all-time highs from World War II. The same projections show GDP growth accelerating. 1.7% in 2025, 1.6% in 2026, and then a move up to 2.0% in 2027 and 2028. But this growth assumes that the tariff regime stays intact. That’s now being threatened. Court case could kill tariffs and change fiscal forecasts Right now, the U.S. Court of Appeals is reviewing a case challenging the legal foundation of Trump’s reciprocal tariffs. The case focuses on whether these duties are allowed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. A decision could come before the end of August, or sometime in September. If the court rules against the administration, those tariffs could be dismantled, gutting the revenue stream that S&P and the CBO are counting on. A letter from the Justice Department described what would happen if those tariffs vanish. “In such a scenario, people would be forced from their homes, millions of jobs would be eliminated, hardworking Americans would lose their savings, and even Social Security and Medicare could be threatened,” said the DOJ in the filing. The administration is clearly worried about the case going the wrong way. Fitch Ratings, which also reaffirmed the AA+ credit rating last week, sees a rougher path. Unlike S&P, Fitch doesn’t expect the deficit picture to improve. The firm projects a drop in the deficit to 6.9% of GDP in 2025 from 7.7% in 2024, but it doesn’t last. As new tax cuts from the OBBBA go into effect next year, overall revenue is expected to fall. Fitch sees the deficit rising to 7.8% of GDP in 2026 and 7.9% in 2027, despite strong tariff revenues. In a statement, Fitch said, “Government revenues will fall, driven by additional tax exemptions on tips and overtime, expanded deductions for state and local taxes (SALT), and additional deductions for people over 65 included in the OBBBA, despite the continued increases in tariff revenues, which Fitch expects to average USD300 billion in both years.” The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

Over the past week, major holders have included hundreds of millions of DOGE. This has pushed prices higher, but this isn’t the price peak of the meme coin as analysts have labeled it as the “next big run.” The technical indicators are showing very bullish signs. With institutional interest stirring, Dogecoin could be gearing up for a large breakout rally towards 1$. While DOGE makes headlines, insiders think it’s not only DOGE that is going to be a speculative driver in the meme coin cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE is another token touted as a top altcoins to hold. On-chain data confirms that whales are accumulating Dogecoin once again. In August, the whales have accumulated more than 680 million to 2 billion DOGE. The warrants’ total supply now accounts for almost 18% of the circulating supply. The pressure of this heavy accumulation has turned $0.21 into a powerful support level despite the Qubic-related 51% attack fears. Technically, Dogecoin is flashing bullish signals. The (50-day MA above 200-day MA) formation of the golden cross and the double-bottom pattern are emerging around $0.21, $0.22. If resistance (the region of $0.30 and $0.50) breaks decisively, we could see more upside. According to some analysts, with whales continuing to buy and retail sentiment growing, the coin could aim much higher than $1, which is no longer a meme-level target but a realistic objective for the medium term. Institutional activity also seems to be picking up. The Dogecoin thesis is getting added credibility and inflows after a $50 million Trump-linked acquisition of a Dogecoin mining operation and signals of an easier Fed policy. Why DOGE Could Still Rally When retail traders hesitated, whales did heavy accumulation of coins. It is similar to the strategy before breakouts. Cost-free technical backing at $0.21–$0.22 might create an optimal springboard for bulls. The government something and softening monetary policy, macro catalysts could align for crypto like doge. As interest shifts to meme themes, DOGE is likely early in a rotation due to Solana’s growth and alternate coin excitement. Experts are now focusing on MAGACOIN FINANCE as the presale that will do better than those resulting from whale cycles. MAGACOIN is building quietly, with capped supply, vetted audits, and a surge of retail engagement, while DOGE garners attention for now. Since whale activity usually announces DOGE rally cycles, MAGACOIN presale participants are in early positions that have historically reaped outsized rewards when meme narratives begin to trend mainstream. According to forecast models, there will be 5 10x gains with the bull run which is a high-upside complement to DOGE-driven plays. Smart Investor Strategy: Ride the Wave and Diversify Constructing a portfolio around meme season requires balance: Core: Larger-cap, stable coins like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Momentum allocation: 10–20% dedicated to DOGE and meme cycles, especially during FOMO phases. Speculative edge: A small stake (3–5%) in high-upside emergent presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Risk management: Use stop-losses and limit orders to protect capital while allowing for upside. Conclusion Whale accumulation, bullish technical setups, and changing macro sentiment fuel Dogecoin’s resurgence. DOGE may range between $0.30–$0.50 in the near term but some analysts think sustained momentum could eventually take it to $1. For investors looking to exploit the explosive upside that often accompanies meme reprisals, presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE will serve as a speculative yet structured way in – an early entry into narratives that will likely define the 2025 altcoin season.

Some tokens stand out not only for their strong communities but also for their potential to generate huge returns. Analysts are pointing toward MAGACOIN FINANCE, Solana, and Shiba Inu as the names to watch in the year ahead. These aren’t just hype coins—they carry catalysts that could trigger explosive upside. Among them, MAGACOIN FINANCE has drawn fresh attention as the rising star of the best presales in 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE — Breakout Pick with 35x Potential The MAGACOIN FINANCE project has quickly become a talking point for traders looking at multipliers. Analysts say it could become the breakout success of the best presales in 2025 , fueled by growing interest in patriotic-themed tokens. Forecasts point to a huge 35x crypto gains potential, and the hype around this token is hard to ignore. What’s catching even more eyes is the PATRIOT50X code , which gives early buyers a 50% bonus . The promotion is limited and spots are running out, which is why traders looking for top crypto presales in 2025 are rushing in. Many see MAGACOIN as a unique play compared to typical meme tokens—positioning it as both a cultural statement and a financial opportunity. Solana Price Prediction: ETF Approval Could Drive $500+ One of the most discussed altcoins right now is Solana. Analysts tracking the Solana price prediction for 2025 are eyeing a bullish range of $500–$1,000. The key driver is the SEC’s decision on spot Solana ETFs, which has a final deadline of October 16, 2025. Many believe approval could trigger heavy institutional inflows, mirroring what happened with Bitcoin ETFs. Already, the REX Shares Solana Staking ETF has gathered over $150 million in assets under management, showing strong investor interest. With active on-chain growth and increasing demand through regulated investment vehicles, Solana is repeatedly being named one of the best altcoins to buy now . If the ETF approval comes through, Solana could easily rank among the top crypto presales narratives of 2025. SHIBA INU Forecast: Meme Power Meets Layer-2 Shiba Inu remains a crowd favorite, and the SHIBA INU forecast for 2025 puts potential highs between $0.00006 and $0.00010. The optimism comes from multiple fronts—ongoing token burns, Shibarium’s Layer-2 scaling progress, and renewed cycles in meme-based coins. Recent prediction roundups even highlight $0.00008471–$0.00010 as possible peaks if market conditions stay favorable. For investors scanning the best altcoins to buy now, SHIB continues to rank high because of its community-driven approach. Its loyal base and ability to move with broader risk-on cycles keep it well-positioned among the best presales in 2025 discussions. Final Thought: Where the 35x Gains Could Land Crypto in 2025 is shaping up around opportunity. Solana has the institutional story. Shiba Inu brings meme energy with real technical progress. But MAGACOIN FINANCE is the one drawing headlines for its bold 35x crypto gains forecasts. With early access bonuses, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being talked about as one of the top crypto presales for traders who want in before wider exposure.

While stalwarts like XRP and Cardano are making waves with institutional adoption and regulatory clarity, a rising star— MAGACOIN FINANCE —is catching attention as a potential breakout coin. Whether you’re a seasoned crypto trader or just dipping your toes in, these five altcoins including SUI and Litecoin could deliver explosive growth heading into the next bull cycle. Let’s dive into the top 5 altcoins to watch—and why MAGACOIN FINANCE deserves a front-row seat on your investment radar. 1. XRP (Ripple): Positioned for Utility-Driven Growth XRP continues to hold its ground as one of the best altcoins to buy , especially with legal clarity finally shining through in the U.S. court system. After years of regulatory headwinds, Ripple Labs has emerged stronger, with XRP being classified as not a security in key legal decisions. Recent updates show that Ripple is expanding partnerships across banking corridors in Latin America and Asia, and XRP’s cross-border payment use case is proving resilient. This utility-driven approach positions XRP for strong adoption as global finance continues its blockchain transformation. With regulatory hurdles largely behind it, XRP is primed for large-scale institutional integration and price appreciation in 2025. 2. Cardano (ADA): The Smart Contract Giant Enters Institutional Territory Cardano has officially entered a critical institutional phase , positioning itself as one of the best altcoins to buy for long-term holders and institutional investors alike. Backed by the upcoming Cardano Summit 2025 in Berlin and the likely approval of a U.S. spot ETF, ADA is approaching a major turning point. Key Drivers for ADA in 2025: Pending Spot ETF Decision: Grayscale’s ADA ETF is under review by the SEC, with an approval decision due in August. Prediction markets show an 83% chance of approval. Regulatory Clarity: Under the U.S. Clarity Act, ADA is now classified as a commodity. Institutional Confidence: Over $1.2 billion in ADA is being managed by top custodians. With regulatory clarity, institutional inflows, and upcoming high-profile events, ADA’s path to $1+ looks highly plausible. 3. MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGA): The Sleeper Altcoin Set for Massive 2025 Gains Among the best altcoins to buy right now, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the underdog with the biggest upside potential. This community-driven crypto project is gaining serious traction for its strong brand identity, viral marketing, and a tokenomics model designed to reward holders. MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t just riding hype—it’s building a growing ecosystem focused on DeFi access, yield farming, and political crypto activism. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Gaining Momentum: Presale Momentum: With the presale now live, early investors can lock in MAGA at a deep discount before it hits major exchanges. Marketing Blitz: Backed by a massive influencer push, online engagement is skyrocketing. Exchange Listings Incoming: Multiple CEX and DEX listings expected shortly after presale. MAGACOIN FINANCE offers high-risk, high-reward potential. With a loyal base and explosive presale growth, it could become 2025’s most talked-about altcoin. Included in the Best Cryptos to Buy list for multi-year bull market scaling, MAGACOIN FINANCE has shown strong potential for long-term growth. Backed by solid fundamentals, increasing adoption, and investor confidence, they are well-positioned to perform exceptionally well throughout the upcoming market cycles and could deliver substantial returns over time. If you’re looking for the best altcoins to buy before the next parabolic run—MAGACOIN FINANCE is your moonshot. 4. SUI: Tech-Powered Growth with Institutional Backing SUI is proving itself as a serious DeFi player with surging trading volume and a wave of institutional support. SUI 2025 Highlights: Swiss Bank Adoption: AMINA will offer trading and staking for SUI. DEX Explosion: Over $1.4 billion in July 2025 volume; $80B+ YTD throughput. Strong Technicals: SUI is pushing $3.74 with bullish indicators and a $5+ target. TVL Nears $2.25 Billion: Massive liquidity and on-chain participation. With both technical and institutional momentum, SUI is a solid addition to any list of best altcoins to buy this year. 5. Litecoin (LTC): The OG Altcoin Reinventing Itself Litecoin may be old, but it’s far from irrelevant. With new Layer-2 developments and growing corporate interest, LTC is writing a new chapter. 2025 Developments: $100M Treasury Allocation: MEI Pharma invested in LTC, marking the largest corporate LTC buy ever. ETF Approval Chances High: Grayscale and CoinShares ETF decisions are expected by December. Layer-2 Innovations: LitVM integration allows cross-chain swaps and smart contracts. MWEB Privacy Use: Over 164K LTC locked in private transactions. Litecoin’s blend of security, adoption, and development upgrades gives it long-term staying power—and makes it one of the best altcoins to buy for conservative growth plays. Final Thoughts The market is brimming with opportunity, but a few names clearly rise above the rest. For conservative investors, XRP and Cardano offer institutional backing and legal clarity. For growth-focused buyers, SUI and Litecoin present strong on-chain activity and innovation. But for those looking to get in early on a project with viral potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the best altcoin to buy before it breaks out. With an active presale, deflationary tokenomics, and rapid community growth, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be your ticket to multiple gains in the next bull cycle.

50679132,564776,1756166427,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50679132.jpeg,"Record Outflows Hit Crypto Funds, But Ethereum May Be Turning the Tables on Bitcoin",https://bitcoinist.com/record-outflows-crypto-ethereum-tables-on-bitcoin/,"Crypto asset investment products recorded their most significant outflows in months, as investor sentiment swung sharply amid signals from US monetary policymakers. According to the latest report from CoinShares, a total of $1.43 billion exited crypto investment vehicles last week, the heaviest weekly outflow since March. CoinShares noted that trading volumes in exchange-traded products (ETPs) rose to $38 billion over the same period, around 50% above the 2025 average. This increase in trading activity reflected polarized market sentiment, as investors weighed the Federal Reserve’s policy outlook . James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, explained: Outflows of $2 billion were recorded in the first part of the week, but sentiment shifted after Jerome Powell’s address at the Jackson Hole Symposium, which many interpreted as more dovish than expected. By the end of the week, we saw inflows of $594 million. Divergence Between Bitcoin and Ethereum Flows While the market overall faced pressure, the performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum diverged. Bitcoin bore the brunt of outflows, losing around $1 billion, while Ethereum’s outflows were more limited at $440 million. The mid-week rebound particularly favored Ethereum, which now shows $2.5 billion in net inflows month-to-date, compared to Bitcoin’s $1 billion in outflows. This shift has adjusted the year-to-date picture for both assets. Ethereum inflows now represent about 26% of total assets under management (AuM), while Bitcoin accounts for just 11%. The report pointed out that this could signal a change in how institutional investors are allocating capital between the two leading cryptocurrencies. Ethereum’s role in most layer two networks and the anticipation around broader adoption through ETFs may be supporting this trend, while Bitcoin continues to face challenges tied to its macroeconomic narrative as “digital gold.” Altcoin Performance Reflects Broader Market Rotation Beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, altcoins recorded mixed results. Several tokens posted positive inflows, including XRP ($25 million), Solana ($12 million), and Cronos ($4.4 million). These movements suggest selective confidence in certain blockchain ecosystems, particularly those with strong user activity or institutional exposure. Conversely, some projects faced headwinds. Sui ($12.9 million outflows) and Ton ($1.5 million outflows) were among the most affected, reflecting investor caution or profit-taking in assets that had seen speculative runs earlier in the year. Butterfill noted that trading behavior remains highly sensitive to both regulatory developments and macroeconomic expectations, with US monetary policy continuing to act as a key driver of crypto investment flows. Looking ahead, it is expected that fund flows will remain volatile as markets digest further policy signals and macroeconomic data . However, the contrasting performance between Bitcoin and Ethereum suggests that investors may increasingly diversify within digital assets, rather than treating the sector as a single, homogeneous market.

In the 2020–2021 bull run, ETH skyrocketed more than 3,900%, climbing from under $100 to nearly $4,900 at its peak. Related Reading: Solana Extends Streak, Outshines Ethereum in DEX Volume – Details That surge was fueled by the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and a wave of institutional interest. Now, as Ethereum enters a new cycle backed by stronger fundamentals and wider adoption, investors are bracing for a potential repeat. This time, the story goes beyond retail speculation. Institutional demand is accelerating at record pace, with Ethereum ETFs, staking yields, and corporate treasury allocations reshaping the market dynamics. Institutional Demand Redefines Ethereum’s Market Position In 2025, Ethereum-based ETFs have far outpaced their Bitcoin counterparts, attracting over $12.1 billion in assets under management. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) alone saw nearly $300 million in inflows in August, underscoring Wall Street’s growing appetite for ETH exposure. Meanwhile, Bitcoin ETFs faced over $1.1 billion in outflows, signaling a dramatic shift in capital allocation. Beyond ETFs, public companies now hold 3.4% of Ethereum’s total supply, with more than 3.5 million ETH staked in corporate treasuries. Household names like Ferrari and Deutsche Bank are integrating Ethereum into payments, tokenization platforms, and settlement systems. Unlike Bitcoin, which remains a non-yielding store of value, Ethereum offers corporations yield-generating opportunities through 3–5% staking rewards, making it both a treasury asset and a productive instrument. ETH's price records some losses on the daily chart. Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview Why ETH Could Outperform Again Ethereum’s long-term bull case rests on three pillars: Deflationary mechanics: Post-Merge upgrades and token burns have reduced ETH supply by 0.1% quarter-over-quarter, reinforcing scarcity. Yield generation: With nearly 30% of ETH staked, institutions enjoy consistent returns absent in Bitcoin’s model. Regulatory clarity: The SEC and Europe’s MiCA framework have reclassified Ethereum as a utility token, giving the green light for ETFs and large-scale adoption. Ethereum now powers 53% of real-world asset tokenization, strengthening its role as the backbone of decentralized finance and digital settlements. Analysts at Standard Chartered and other firms are forecasting ETH could reach $7,500 by year-end 2025, with potential long-term targets of $12,000–$18,000 as adoption accelerates. Final Takeaway Ethereum is no longer just Bitcoin’s “little brother.” Its hybrid profile, a deflationary, yield-bearing, utility-driven asset, makes it a compelling choice for institutional and retail investors alike.

The widely followed Crypto Fear & Greed Index recently registered a score of 48, firmly placing it in a neutral zone. This crucial metric offers a snapshot of market sentiment, helping investors gauge whether participants are feeling fearful or overly greedy. Understanding this index can provide valuable insights into potential market movements, allowing you to make more informed decisions. What Does a Neutral Crypto Fear & Greed Index Mean for You? When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index sits at 48, it signals a balanced market environment. This score is just one point up from the previous day, indicating a steady, unwavering sentiment. A neutral reading suggests that investors are neither panicking and selling off their assets nor are they excessively exuberant and buying everything in sight. Instead, there’s a cautious equilibrium. No Extreme Pressure: Unlike extreme fear (closer to 0), which often precedes market bottoms, or extreme greed (closer to 100), which can signal a market top, a neutral 48 means less immediate pressure from either side. Opportunity for Calm Analysis: This period allows for a more rational assessment of the market without the emotional pull of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) or FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt). Watch for Shifts: While neutral, it’s a dynamic score. Smart investors watch for slight movements as potential precursors to a shift towards fear or greed. Unpacking the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: How is it Calculated? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is not just a random number; it’s a sophisticated blend of various market indicators. Data provider Alternative meticulously calculates this index, offering a comprehensive view of investor psychology. Let’s break down the key components that contribute to its score: Volatility (25%): Measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average over 30 and 90 days. Higher volatility often indicates fear. Market Volume (25%): Compares current trading volume and market momentum to average values. High buying volume in a positive market can signal greed. Social Media Mentions (15%): Analyzes specific keywords on social media platforms. A surge in mentions, especially with positive sentiment, can suggest increasing greed. Surveys (15%): Although currently paused, these polls previously asked investors about their market outlook, directly gauging sentiment. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): An increasing Bitcoin dominance often indicates fear, as investors might be fleeing altcoins for the relative safety of Bitcoin. A decreasing dominance can signal greed as money flows into riskier altcoins. Google Search Volume (10%): Tracks search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Sudden spikes in searches for terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” can indicate fear, while searches for “how to buy crypto” might suggest growing interest and greed. These factors combine to paint a holistic picture of the market’s collective mood, which is invaluable for traders and long-term holders alike. Navigating Market Sentiment: Why the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is Crucial Understanding the sentiment conveyed by the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a powerful tool in your investment arsenal. It helps you recognize the prevailing emotions that often drive market behavior, providing a crucial counter-perspective to your own biases. For instance, when the index screams “extreme greed,” it might be a signal to exercise caution, as markets can be due for a correction. Conversely, an “extreme fear” reading often presents a unique opportunity for those brave enough to buy when others are selling. However, it’s vital to remember that this index is just one indicator. It should always be used in conjunction with fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and your own risk management strategy. Relying solely on sentiment can be misleading, as markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent. Actionable Insights from the Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 48 With the Crypto Fear & Greed Index maintaining its neutral stance at 48, what are some smart moves for investors? This period is an excellent time for strategic planning rather than impulsive trading. Here are some actionable insights: Re-evaluate Your Portfolio: A neutral market provides a calm environment to assess your current holdings. Are your investments aligned with your long-term goals? Research New Opportunities: Without the distraction of extreme market swings, dedicate time to researching promising projects and understanding their fundamentals. Practice Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): If you’re building a position, a neutral market can be a good time to continue or start a DCA strategy, buying small amounts regularly to average out your purchase price. Set Realistic Expectations: Avoid expecting parabolic gains or sudden crashes. A neutral index suggests a more measured pace for the market. Strengthen Your Knowledge: Use this period to deepen your understanding of market cycles and how different indicators interact. Remember, patience and informed decision-making are your best allies in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a guide, not a crystal ball. In conclusion, the current neutral reading of 48 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index offers a valuable moment of equilibrium in the often-turbulent crypto market. It’s a reminder that while emotions can run high, understanding these underlying sentiments, coupled with sound research and a disciplined approach, is paramount for successful navigation. By staying informed about the index and its components, investors can better understand market psychology and make choices that align with their personal financial strategies, fostering a more resilient and profitable investment journey. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool that measures the current sentiment of the cryptocurrency market. It ranges from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed), providing insight into whether investors are feeling anxious or overly optimistic. Q2: How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index calculated? It’s calculated based on several factors, including market volatility (25%), trading volume (25%), social media mentions (15%), surveys (15%), Bitcoin’s market cap dominance (10%), and Google search volume (10%). These components are weighted to produce a single sentiment score. Q3: What does a neutral score (like 48) on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index indicate? A neutral score, such as 48, suggests that the market is in a state of equilibrium. Investors are neither experiencing extreme fear nor extreme greed, indicating a period of cautious balance and potentially more rational decision-making. Q4: Can I use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to predict market movements? While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index offers valuable insights into market psychology, it should not be used as a standalone prediction tool. It’s best utilized as one of many indicators, alongside fundamental and technical analysis, to inform your investment strategy. Q5: What are the limitations of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? Its main limitation is that it’s a sentiment indicator, not a definitive market predictor. Markets can remain irrational, and the index doesn’t account for all external factors or fundamental changes. It’s a snapshot, not a crystal ball.

As the entire market takes a breather, investors and traders are asking what the best crypto to buy now as recovery takes shape. As in all cycles, the popular attention is turned to established tokens with outsized market caps. However, analysts say a mix of established tokens and emerging players is the most strategic investment play. From Ethereum’s institutional-led growth, PEPE’s meme energy, and MAGACOIN FINANCE ’s surging momentum, here are the five tokens analysts are picking as the best choice for the upcoming bull cycle. 1. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Rising Wildcard With markets showing early signs of recovery, investors are scanning for the best crypto to buy now . Among the most talked-about picks is MAGACOIN FINANCE, tipped for up to 25x ROI in the next cycle. Analysts say the project is different from the meme tokens that emerge every market cycle. They note MAGACOIN FINANCE has a surging momentum that has gone beyond regular investors to renowned whale investors who often move the market with their trades. At the same time, analysts’ coverage is growing, which has since spurred a sense of urgency in investors still on the sideline. Those who spot breakout altcoins say MAGACOIN FINANCE has all it takes to outperform the market in the upcoming bull cycle. For investors seeking something fresh beyond established names, it is quickly becoming a standout choice. 2. Ethereum (ETH): Utility and Upgrades Ethereum remains central to DeFi growth. The Pectra upgrade enhanced scalability and staking, while $97B is currently locked in its DeFi ecosystem. Despite short-term price pressure, analysts see ETH regaining momentum as macro conditions ease, keeping it on the list of the best altcoins to invest in 2025. 3. PEPE: Meme Power with Breakout Potential PEPE continues to ride the meme wave. Whale accumulation is strong, and technical charts hint at a potential breakout above $0.00001250. While highly speculative, it remains a community favorite among traders hunting high-risk, high-reward bets. 4. Litecoin (LTC): Institutional Backing Builds Litecoin is attracting attention post-halving, with futures open interest at record highs. A $100M corporate treasury allocation has added credibility, while analysts eye targets above $175 if momentum holds. 5. Avalanche (AVAX): Real-World Adoption Expands Avalanche is gaining traction in real-world tokenization, with $300M in hedge funds recently deployed on its blockchain. Daily transactions are climbing fast, making AVAX one of the more promising recovery plays. Conclusion For investors seeking safety and moderate returns, established and popular tokens such as Ethereum and Pepe remain good options as some of the best cryptos to buy now for the 2025 recovery. Litecoin’s growing adoption could also spur the token to new heights. However, for smart investors seeking the kind of gains those who got into Shiba Inu and Dogecoin early made, analysts say MAGACOIN FINANCE is the token to have in your portfolio.

This unexpected move has ignited discussions about the future direction of monetary policy and its potential impact on everything from inflation to the cryptocurrency market. For anyone watching the global economic landscape, understanding this decision’s nuances is absolutely crucial. Understanding the Role of a Federal Reserve Governor So, what exactly does a Federal Reserve Governor do? These individuals play a vital role in shaping the nation’s economic future. They sit on the Federal Reserve Board, which is the main governing body of the Federal Reserve System. They participate in setting the federal funds rate, influencing borrowing costs across the economy. They contribute to decisions on quantitative easing and tightening, which affect the money supply. They oversee the regulation of banks and financial institutions, ensuring stability. Lisa Cook, as a Federal Reserve Governor , has been a key voice in these discussions, bringing her expertise to critical economic challenges. Her removal could signal a significant shift in the balance of perspectives within the Fed. Why Does This Dismissal Matter for Markets? Any change at the top levels of the Federal Reserve can create immediate market reactions. Investors crave stability and predictability, especially concerning monetary policy. A dismissal like this introduces an element of uncertainty. Here’s why it matters: Policy Direction: A new Federal Reserve Governor might hold different views on inflation, interest rates, or economic stimulus, potentially altering the Fed’s overall strategy. Investor Confidence: Political interference in the ostensibly independent Federal Reserve can erode investor confidence, leading to market volatility. Global Impact: The U.S. dollar and its policies have global implications, affecting international trade and capital flows. Therefore, the market’s initial reaction often reflects this heightened state of anticipation and concern about what comes next for the Federal Reserve Governor role. Potential Shifts in Monetary Policy and Economic Outlook The Federal Reserve’s decisions directly influence the cost of money and credit, impacting everything from mortgage rates to business investments. A change in a Federal Reserve Governor could foreshadow shifts in these critical areas. Consider these potential implications: Interest Rates: A more dovish (pro-low interest rates) or hawkish (pro-high interest rates) appointee could alter the trajectory of rate hikes or cuts. Inflation Control: Different approaches to tackling inflation might emerge, affecting purchasing power and asset valuations. Economic Growth: Monetary policy is a key lever for stimulating or cooling economic growth. A new appointee’s philosophy could steer the economy in a new direction. These policy shifts, driven by changes among the Federal Reserve Governor ranks, are closely watched by economists and investors alike for their profound economic consequences. What Does This Mean for Cryptocurrency Markets? Cryptocurrency markets are notoriously sensitive to macroeconomic conditions and changes in monetary policy. While often seen as an alternative to traditional finance, crypto assets are not immune to the ripple effects of Federal Reserve decisions. How might this dismissal affect crypto? Interest Rate Sensitivity: Higher interest rates generally make ‘risk-on’ assets like cryptocurrencies less attractive, as safer investments yield better returns. Inflation Hedges: If the new policy direction leads to concerns about inflation, some investors might turn to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as potential hedges. Regulatory Environment: A new administration or Fed leadership could signal changes in the regulatory approach to digital assets, impacting their adoption and price. The uncertainty surrounding the next Federal Reserve Governor and subsequent policy decisions means crypto investors should remain vigilant, observing how these traditional financial shifts play out. The dismissal of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook is a significant event, sparking questions about the future of U.S. monetary policy and its broader economic implications. While the full impact will unfold over time, it underscores the interconnectedness of political decisions, financial markets, and even the burgeoning world of cryptocurrencies. Staying informed and understanding these crucial shifts is paramount for navigating an ever-evolving financial landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Who is Lisa Cook? Lisa Cook is an American economist who served as a Federal Reserve Governor. She is known for her research on macroeconomics, international economics, and the economics of innovation. 2. What is the primary role of a Federal Reserve Governor? A Federal Reserve Governor serves on the Board of Governors, participating in monetary policy decisions, supervising and regulating banks, and maintaining the stability of the financial system. 3. How does a change in the Federal Reserve’s leadership impact the economy? Changes in Fed leadership can signal potential shifts in monetary policy, affecting interest rates, inflation, and economic growth. This can influence investor confidence and market behavior. 4. What could this dismissal mean for cryptocurrency markets? Such dismissals introduce macroeconomic uncertainty. This can lead to volatility in crypto markets, especially if it signals changes in interest rate policy or the broader regulatory environment for digital assets. 5. What is the Federal Reserve’s primary mandate? The Federal Reserve’s primary mandate is to achieve maximum employment, stable prices (low inflation), and moderate long-term interest rates.

This innovative process, which converts real-world assets into digital tokens on a blockchain, is drawing serious attention from major players. Recently, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and leading crypto exchange Kraken held pivotal discussions, signaling a crucial step towards understanding and regulating this burgeoning field. What Exactly is Asset Tokenization? Asset tokenization involves creating a digital representation of a tangible or intangible asset on a blockchain. Think of it like this: a piece of real estate, a share in a company, or even a work of art can be divided into many digital tokens. Each token represents a fractional ownership of that asset. This process brings several advantages to traditional markets. It can enhance liquidity, reduce transaction costs, and make investments more accessible to a wider audience. Moreover, the transparency and immutability of blockchain technology underpin the security of these digital assets. The Crucial SEC and Kraken Dialogue on Asset Tokenization The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s dedicated crypto task force recently engaged in high-level talks with Kraken. Their agenda focused on the intricate methods involved in asset tokenization , alongside the development of related trading systems and comprehensive regulatory frameworks. This meeting, as reported by Cointelegraph, underscores the SEC’s growing interest in understanding and potentially integrating digital assets into the existing financial system. Such discussions are vital. They represent a proactive approach from regulators to engage with industry leaders like Kraken. This collaboration aims to ensure that as asset tokenization evolves, it does so within a clear and secure legal environment, protecting investors while fostering innovation. Why Does Asset Tokenization Matter for Investors and Markets? The potential benefits of widespread asset tokenization are immense, promising to reshape how we perceive and interact with investments: Increased Liquidity: Historically illiquid assets, such as real estate or private equity, can become easily tradable through fractional ownership. Fractional Ownership: Investors can buy small portions of high-value assets, democratizing access to investment opportunities. Enhanced Transparency: Blockchain records provide an immutable and transparent ledger of ownership and transactions. Lower Costs: Eliminating intermediaries can significantly reduce fees and administrative overheads associated with traditional asset transfers. Global Accessibility: Tokenized assets can be traded 24/7 across borders, opening up new markets for investors worldwide. Navigating the Challenges of Regulating Asset Tokenization Despite its promise, the path to mainstream asset tokenization is not without its hurdles. Regulatory clarity remains a significant challenge. Defining whether a token represents a security, a commodity, or another type of asset is complex and varies across jurisdictions. Other challenges include: Legal Frameworks: Existing laws were not designed for digital assets, requiring careful adaptation or new legislation. Interoperability: Ensuring different blockchain networks can communicate and transfer tokenized assets seamlessly. Security Risks: While blockchain is secure, smart contract vulnerabilities or platform hacks remain concerns. Investor Protection: Establishing robust mechanisms to protect investors in a nascent and rapidly evolving market. What’s Next for the Future of Asset Tokenization? The ongoing dialogue between the SEC and industry players like Kraken is a positive indicator. It suggests a collaborative effort to develop thoughtful and effective regulatory frameworks for asset tokenization . This approach is crucial for building trust and encouraging wider adoption by institutional and retail investors alike. Moving forward, we can expect continued exploration into legal definitions, technological standards, and international cooperation. The goal is to create an environment where the benefits of tokenization can flourish responsibly, paving the way for a more efficient and inclusive financial ecosystem. The recent discussions between the SEC and Kraken mark a pivotal moment for asset tokenization . This collaboration highlights a growing recognition of tokenization’s transformative potential while underscoring the critical need for clear regulatory guidance. As these dialogues continue, they will undoubtedly shape the future of finance, making traditional assets more accessible, liquid, and transparent for everyone. The journey ahead will require careful navigation, but the destination promises a truly revolutionary financial landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is asset tokenization? Asset tokenization is the process of converting the rights to an asset, whether tangible (like real estate) or intangible (like intellectual property), into a digital token on a blockchain. Each token can represent fractional ownership. Why are the SEC and Kraken discussing asset tokenization? The SEC, as a financial regulator, and Kraken, a major crypto exchange, are discussing asset tokenization to understand its mechanics, potential trading systems, and to develop appropriate regulatory frameworks to ensure investor protection and market integrity. What are the main benefits of asset tokenization? Key benefits include increased liquidity for illiquid assets, fractional ownership opportunities, enhanced transparency through blockchain, lower transaction costs, and global accessibility for investors. What challenges does asset tokenization face? Challenges include achieving regulatory clarity, developing suitable legal frameworks, ensuring interoperability between different blockchain platforms, managing security risks, and establishing robust investor protection mechanisms. How will regulation impact asset tokenization? Clear and effective regulation is crucial for the widespread adoption of asset tokenization . It will build trust, define legal statuses for tokenized assets, protect investors, and provide a stable environment for innovation and growth in the market.

Recently, the Altcoin Season Index has taken a notable dip, falling three points to a score of 46. This shift is sparking discussions among investors and analysts alike. What exactly does this decline signify for your crypto portfolio? Are we truly heading into a ‘Bitcoin Season’? Let’s unpack the implications of this crucial movement and understand what a score of 46 means for the future of altcoins. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index: How Is It Measured? To truly grasp the significance of the recent drop, it’s essential to understand how the Altcoin Season Index works. CoinMarketCap, a trusted name in crypto data, provides this valuable metric. It’s not just a random number; it’s a carefully calculated indicator designed to give us a snapshot of the market’s sentiment towards alternative cryptocurrencies compared to Bitcoin. The Calculation: The index evaluates the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Exclusions: Stablecoins and wrapped coins are intentionally left out to ensure the index reflects true market sentiment for volatile assets. The Timeframe: Performance is measured over the past 90 days, providing a medium-term view rather than daily fluctuations. Defining a Season: An altcoin season is officially declared if 75% or more of these top 100 coins have outperformed Bitcoin. If not, it’s considered a Bitcoin season. A score closer to 100 strongly indicates an altcoin season, suggesting that a broad range of altcoins are seeing significant gains relative to Bitcoin. Conversely, a lower score points towards Bitcoin’s dominance. Why Did the Altcoin Season Index Drop to 46? The recent three-point fall in the Altcoin Season Index to 46 suggests a notable shift in market dynamics. This decline doesn’t happen in a vacuum; it reflects a period where a significant number of the top 100 altcoins have underperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. While the exact reasons can be multifaceted, several factors often contribute to such movements: Bitcoin’s Strength: Often, when Bitcoin experiences a strong rally, capital tends to flow from altcoins into Bitcoin, causing altcoins to lag. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic trends or regulatory news can impact the entire crypto market, but altcoins, being generally riskier, might see larger pullbacks. Specific Altcoin Performance: If several major altcoins within the top 100 face project-specific challenges or lack significant development news, their underperformance can collectively drag down the index. A score of 46 places us firmly outside of an ‘altcoin season’ (which requires 75 or higher). It indicates a period of relative neutrality or even slight Bitcoin dominance, where altcoins are generally struggling to keep pace. Navigating Market Shifts: What Does a 46 Mean for Your Portfolio? When the Altcoin Season Index hovers around 46, it signals a time for careful consideration rather than panic. This isn’t a strong ‘Bitcoin season’ either, as that would typically be a much lower score. Instead, it suggests a more balanced, perhaps uncertain, market environment where capital isn’t overwhelmingly favoring one side. For savvy investors, this period presents both challenges and opportunities. Re-evaluate Your Holdings: It’s a good moment to assess your altcoin positions. Are they still strong projects with solid fundamentals? Consider Diversification: While altcoins might be struggling, Bitcoin could be consolidating or preparing for its next move. A balanced portfolio can help mitigate risks. Focus on Fundamentals: During periods of uncertainty, projects with clear use cases, strong development teams, and active communities tend to weather the storm better. Risk Management: This environment underscores the importance of not over-allocating to speculative altcoins. Remember, market cycles are natural. A dip in the index doesn’t mean altcoins are doomed forever; it simply reflects the current performance trend. Understanding these trends helps you make more informed decisions. Is an Altcoin Resurgence Still Possible? Despite the recent dip in the Altcoin Season Index , the potential for an altcoin resurgence is always present in the volatile crypto market. Historically, crypto markets move in cycles, and periods of Bitcoin dominance are often followed by altcoin rallies once Bitcoin consolidates or reaches new highs. What could trigger such a shift? Bitcoin Stability: A stable Bitcoin price often allows capital to flow into altcoins as investors seek higher returns. Technological Breakthroughs: Major upgrades or significant adoption news for key altcoin projects can ignite rallies. New Narratives: Emerging trends like GameFi, NFTs, or specific Layer-2 solutions can create new interest and drive altcoin performance. While the index currently sits at 46, market sentiment can change rapidly. Staying informed about project developments and broader market trends is crucial. The crypto landscape is constantly evolving, and yesterday’s underperformers can quickly become tomorrow’s stars. In conclusion, the fall of the Altcoin Season Index to 46 is a clear indicator that altcoins are currently facing headwinds against Bitcoin. This crucial shift encourages investors to practice caution, re-evaluate their strategies, and focus on robust projects. While an altcoin season isn’t imminent based on this metric, the dynamic nature of crypto means vigilance and informed decision-making remain paramount. Keep an eye on the index and broader market signals to navigate these fascinating shifts effectively. Frequently Asked Questions About the Altcoin Season Index Q1: What exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? A1: The Altcoin Season Index is a metric provided by CoinMarketCap that indicates whether altcoins are generally outperforming Bitcoin. It’s calculated by comparing the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) against Bitcoin over the past 90 days. Q2: How is an Altcoin Season officially declared? A2: An altcoin season is declared when 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin during the preceding 90-day period. Otherwise, it is considered a Bitcoin season. Q3: What does a score of 46 on the Altcoin Season Index signify? A3: A score of 46 means that less than 75% of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. It indicates that we are currently not in an altcoin season and suggests a period of relative neutrality or slight Bitcoin dominance. Q4: Should I sell all my altcoins if the index falls? A4: Not necessarily. A falling Altcoin Season Index suggests altcoins are underperforming Bitcoin, but it doesn’t mean they won’t recover. It’s a signal to re-evaluate your portfolio, focus on strong fundamentals, and practice good risk management. Market cycles are common, and a dip can be a temporary phase. Q5: What factors can cause the Altcoin Season Index to fall? A5: The index can fall due to several reasons, including strong Bitcoin rallies that draw capital away from altcoins, broader macroeconomic uncertainties, or collective underperformance of several major altcoin projects due to lack of development or specific challenges.

Last week, Ethereum-based ETFs captured a record $2.9 billion in inflows , accounting for nearly 78% of all crypto ETF activity. Yet while Wall Street is piling into ETH, retail investors and savvy traders are looking one step ahead—into MAGACOIN FINANCE , a low-cap gem with 40x return potential that analysts say could outperform Solana over the next market cycle. With Ethereum ETFs validating broader crypto adoption and Solana riding high on ecosystem buzz, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the breakout candidate in the best crypto presale market today —and it’s still early enough to get in before the mainstream catches on. Ethereum ETF Boom Signals Bull Market — But ROI Is Shrinking Ethereum’s recent surge in institutional inflows proves what crypto veterans already knew: ETH is here to stay . Spot Ethereum ETFs saw: $2.9B in net inflows last week Over $17B in trading volume across ETH ETFs Delayed approvals have caused the SEC final decisions to be postponed until October 2025. Ethereum ETF Data : The Block While these numbers show strong long-term conviction , they also signal that much of ETH’s upside may already be priced in —especially with daily outflows like the $197 million withdrawal seen this Monday. Solana’s Progress Is Impressive — But Analysts Say MAGACOIN FINANCE Could 40x Faster Solana is gaining momentum with impressive real-world adoption: $1.15B IPO funded by Solana-based stablecoins Over $2.1B in tokenized stock trading volume on Solana WEEX “Solana Ecosystem Week” boosting short-term activity Despite a solid recovery to the $180 range , many traders remain cautious, waiting on the SEC’s spot-SOL ETF decision (expected August 25) to confirm the next leg up. Yet Solana is already ranked among the top 10 coins. In fact, a substantial rally may only end up giving as little as a two to three times return on the current value. In contrast, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still in its presale phase —and analysts project it could deliver up to 40x gains as it moves from stealth to spotlight. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Be the Best Crypto Opportunity MAGACOIN FINANCE represents a community-centric crypto project with a strong political influence, designed to mesh with viral power and true tokenomics. Whereas Ethereum and Solana continue to dominate the media coverage, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still pulling in the early users who are keen on finding the next 75x gem before it gains widespread popularity. Key Reasons Traders Are Jumping In: · Early-Stage Entry: MAGACOIN is in presale mode—buy before the big centralized exchange listings. · Bonus Tokens: Investors using the PATRIOT50X code are securing 50% extra tokens , adding rocket fuel to their potential ROI. · Cult-Like Community: MAGACOIN FINANCE taps into political meme energy and digital culture, creating the same viral conditions that launched PEPE, DOGE, and WIF. · Analyst Forecasts: Experts say MAGACOIN has 75x upside , outperforming even fast-growing chains like Solana over the next 12–18 months. MAGACOIN FINANCE has gone the same way as the fast-rising Shiba Inu, and from its very beginning, it has been able to generate a similar upward trend, with the possibility to virus-like spreading and meme-driven momentum. Just like SHIB rewarded early adopters with life-changing returns, MAGACOIN is positioned to follow a similar path—with powerful community backing, meme appeal, and early-stage tokenomics that create the perfect setup for exponential growth. Final Thoughts The Ethereum ETF explosion is about more than just ETH—it’s a massive signal that crypto is being taken seriously by the financial elite. But history shows that the biggest returns go to early investors in small-cap coins , not large-cap assets already favored by institutions. That’s exactly where MAGACOIN FINANCE fits in. As ETH ETFs bring billions into crypto and SOL gains enterprise traction, MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving out a lane for those who want to multiply their capital, not just protect it .

Analysts and investors are constantly on the lookout for new projects with massive potential for growth, similar to Ethereum’s past success. Although Solana and XRP continues performing well, presales with asymmetric upside are getting attention for strong gains. MAGACOIN FINANCE is getting strange comparisons to Ethereum’s early days, with some forecasts predicting explosive potential for the next cycle. Ethereum’s Early Growth Blueprint Ethereum was worth less than one dollar in 2015. Today, it trades for thousands of dollars, a remarkable crypto success story. Its early backers benefited from a combination of strong community conviction, revolutionary technology, and long-term adoption. Analysts say the same kind of things could be happening now with certain presale tokens that have popular cultural narratives as well as real demand mechanics. This has caused wild comparisons between the origins of ethereum and some present-day breakout suggestions. Ethereum price is currently around $4,196.57 after failing to break through the $4,800 resistance zone. It is down 3.53% on the day. The asset is stuck between $4,186 and $4,335 because of short profit-taking and selling pressure. MAGACOIN FINANCE — The Ethereum Parallel Analysts are drawing bold comparisons between MAGACOIN FINANCE and Ethereum’s earliest days. Backed by whale accumulation and accelerating smart money inflows, MAGACOIN is being positioned as one of the best altcoins to buy , with forecasts of 1000x potential in the next market cycle. Its capped allocations, verified audits, and scarcity-driven tokenomics are creating the conditions for explosive growth. Investors are acting fast, with millions raised in presales and allocations tightening daily. Analysts suggest that MAGACOIN FINANCE’s narrative and hard fundamentals enable it to stand out within the myriad of meme-themed projects being launched. Demand from whales and fear of missing out (FOMO) from retailers is driving adoption at a speed seldom seen outside of Ethereum’s early days. Why Analysts See 1000x Potential Based on the history of crypto, projects with compelling narratives and verifiable structures can deliver insane multiples. Holders of Ethereum saw life-changing returns in 2017 and 2021. Experts anticipate that MAGACOIN FINANCE may follow in the footsteps of MEME coins, leveraging its community-driven energy, zero-tax trading mechanics, and whale patterns that indicate smart money. The presale momentum remains strong – if that continues, there’s likely to be a dramatic supply squeeze once listing occurs. Furthermore, multiples could conceivably far exceed those typically observed for an altcoin increase. Conclusion — The New Contender for Ethereum’s Crown Although Ethereum is always a crypto economy pillar, with each cycle, there is a new challenger that can provide exponential returns. MAGACOIN FINANCE is experiencing comparisons to Ethereum due to its scarce mechanics, whale-backed growth and presale demand. Analysts are predicting it can grow 1000x during the next cycle . For investors getting ahead of 2025, it’s quickly becoming one of the most talked-about opportunities in the market.

The company also revealed that it now holds more than 102,000 ETH on its balance sheet. ETHZilla Increases Ethereum Holdings According to today’s announcement , ETHZilla currently holds a total of 102,237 ETH at an average acquisition price of $3,948. Executive Chairman McAndrew Rudisill commented: At ETHZilla, we continue to deploy capital to accelerate our Ethereum treasury strategy with discipline and record speed, As we continue to scale our ETH reserves and pursue differentiated yield opportunities, we believe an aggressive stock repurchase program at the current stock price underscores our commitment to maximizing value for shareholders. ETHZilla’s Ethereum holdings are now valued at more than $489 million. This latest acquisition positions the company as the fourth-largest publicly traded firm with an Ethereum treasury. Data from CoinGecko shows that digital assets mining firm Bitmine Immersion currently holds the largest in the world with more than 1.7 million ETH on its balance sheet. It is followed by SharpLink with more than 740,000 ETH in its crypto reserves. Notably, ETHZilla still maintains close to $215 million in cash equivalents. Following today’s announcement, its shares rose 6% to trade above $3.50. Year-to-date, the stock is up over 92%. ETH Adoption Outshing Bitcoin Adoption? While adding BTC as a part of the corporate treasury strategy has been a practice for a few years, seeing companies take the same approach with ETH has been the theme of 2025. Compared to previous years, a wide range of companies began adding ETH to their treasuries this year. For instance, Nasdaq-listed SharpLink Gaming unveiled another major ETH purchase last week, bringing its total ETH holdings to over $3 billion. Similarly, another publicly traded firm – BTCS Inc. said it had bought more than 14,500 ETH last week. Currently, BTCS Inc. is placed sixth in the list of publicly traded Ethereum firms, holding more than 70,000 ETH. Another Nasdaq-listed software firm, GameSquare invested $5 million in ETH as part of its investment strategy. The firm aims to invest as much as $100 million in ETH and other digital assets. The spillover effects of a strong corporate demand for ETH can also be seen in the performance of ETH-based crypto investment products. In July 2025, ETH-based investment products attracted total inflows worth $907 million. Meanwhile, crypto pundits continue to give ambitious ETH price targets, with some as high as $10,000 ETH. At press time, ETH trades at $4,635, down 3.9% over the past 24 hours.",Ethereum|Altcoin|Cryptocurrency|digital currency|ETH|Ether|ethereum etf|ETHUSDT|ETHZilla|on-chain analysis,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-26 01:00:38

Analyst Says Token ‘Inches’ From Next Leg Up,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/215-pengu-rally-analyst-token-inches-leg-up/,"An analyst believes Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) could be close to a big breakout based on this technical analysis (TA) pattern in its 4-hour chart. PENGU Has Potentially Been Following A Bull Flag Recently In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has shared what could be next for Pudgy Penguins according to a chart pattern. The formation in question is a Bull Flag, which is a type of Flag. Flags form whenever the price of an asset experiences a period of consolidation inside a parallel channel following an initial sharp move. This starting move is known as the ‘pole,’ and the channel makes up for the ‘flag.’ Related Reading: When Will Bitcoin Bottom Out? This Could Be The Signal To Watch A Bull Flag occurs when the pole is in the up direction and the flag corresponds to parallel consolidation to a net downside. When the price is trading inside the flag channel, it’s likely to face resistance at the upper line and support at the lower one. A move out of either of these levels can signal a breakout in that direction. Bull Flags are assumed to be bullish continuation patterns, so a breakout may be more likely to occur above the resistance line of the parallel channel. Such a breakout is also considered to be of the same length as the pole of the pattern. Like the Bull Flag, there is also a formation called the Bear Flag. It works much in the same way, except for the fact that the pole and flag are both flipped in orientation. That is, the pole corresponds to a sharp downward move, while the flag represents a phase of consolidation to the upside. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the Bull Flag that the 4-hour price of PENGU has been trading inside for the past month: As displayed in the above graph, PENGU has slowly been descending within the channel of the Bull Flag. The memecoin recently made a retest of the upper level, but it ended up rejected. The asset has since faced a plunge, so it’s uncertain when the next attempt could occur. The longer the coin remains locked inside the channel, however, the likelier an escape could become, whether to the upside or downside. Related Reading: Altseason Things: Ethereum Perps Volume Sets New Record Against Bitcoin In the view of the analyst, Pudgy Penguins is “inches away from a new leg up.” Going by the scale of the pole, a potential bullish breakout could send PENGU to near the $0.10 mark. It only remains to be seen how the cryptocurrency’s price will develop in the coming days and whether a surge above the Bull Flag will occur. PENGU Price At the time of writing, Pudgy Penguins is trading around $0.317, down more than 7% over the last 24 hours.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Bitcoin is trading just below $110,000 after another failed bounce, down roughly 7% since peaking over $117,000 in the wake of Powell’s dovish Jackson Hole speech, according to CoinDesk market data . Ethereum, which briefly touched $4,900 before a sharp reversal, is holding above $4,300 but showing signs of exhaustion after weeks of outperformance. The bull run is fraying, market observers say, as thinning liquidity, ETF outflows, and fragile onchain activity collide with whales rotating into ETH and retail longs getting liquidated. Yet beneath the surface, billion-dollar sovereign and institutional allocations are quietly scaling into volatility, creating a sharp divergence between weak short-term conviction and programmatic long-horizon buying. Glassnode’s latest Market Pulse shows the cycle slipping from euphoria into fragility: spot momentum fading toward oversold territory, ETF flows swinging to a $1 billion outflow, and realized profits collapsing back to breakeven. That fragility was underscored by QCP Capital , which traced this weekend’s crash to an early holder unloading 24,000 BTC into thin liquidity, a move that cascaded into $500 million in liquidations. QCP said the sale exposed just how brittle the market has become with ETFs bleeding $1.2 billion in outflows even as whales rotate into ETH, pushing the ETH/BTC cross through 0.04. Singapore-based market maker Enflux picks up that thread, arguing that not all flows are created equal. While retail longs were blown out, a $2.55 billion ETH stake routed through a single contract and the UAE royal family’s $700 million BTC exposure via Citadel Mining looks less like speculative punts and more like sovereign and institutional allocations. In other words, even as Glassnode’s onchain data shows weakening address activity and fee volumes, there are counterparties deliberately using volatility to scale into size. The result is a divergence: retail leverage continues to get flushed, while long-horizon allocators quietly accumulate. But with transaction fees collapsing back toward decade lows and blocks clearing with little congestion, liquidity on the Bitcoin blockchain itself looks thin. That’s a problem for miners already squeezed by halved rewards, and it leaves the broader market bracing for consolidation, or deeper drawdowns into September, historically Bitcoin’s weakest month. Market Movement BTC : Bitcoin’s brief rebound from its weekend plunge failed Monday, with prices rejected at $113,000 before sliding to a seven-week low near $109,700, down 2.7% on the day and 7% from Friday’s post-Powell peak above $117,000. ETH : Altcoins buckled Monday with ETH dropping nearly 8% below $4,400 and SOL, DOGE, ADA, and LINK sliding 6–8%, triggering $700 million in liquidations, mostly from over $627 million in long bets. Gold: Gold is holding above $3,350 as Powell’s dovish Jackson Hole remarks boost rate-cut bets and geopolitical tensions sustain safe-haven demand, even as dollar strength and upcoming U.S. growth data loom as headwinds. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific stocks fell Tuesday, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 and Topix down 0.54%, as investors weighed Trump’s China comments and U.S.–South Korea trade talks on planned 15% tariffs. S&P 500: U.S. stocks pulled back Monday from a rate-cut-fueled rally, with the S&P 500 down 0.4% as focus turned to Nvidia’s upcoming earnings.

Recent Bitcoin OG deposits totaling a staggering $55.1 million in BTC to Binance have undeniably captured the attention of investors and analysts alike. This significant move, originating from a long-time Bitcoin holder, suggests a potential shift in strategy that could ripple across the broader market. According to expert insights from Onchain Lens, this particular Bitcoin OG has been actively managing their substantial holdings, strategically utilizing both centralized and decentralized platforms for transactions. Unpacking the Recent Bitcoin OG Deposits In a notable series of transactions observed over the past six hours, a prominent Bitcoin OG executed a substantial transfer. This individual deposited 490 BTC, valued at approximately $55.09 million at the time, directly onto the Binance exchange. Simultaneously, they moved an even larger sum of 799 BTC, worth around $89.84 million, to a completely new address. These aren’t just minor movements; they represent a significant portion of capital in the crypto space, indicating careful planning. What makes these particular Bitcoin OG deposits especially interesting is the dual approach taken by the holder. The OG isn’t solely relying on centralized exchanges like Binance. They have also been observed interacting with decentralized exchanges (DEXs) such as Hyperliquid (HYPE). This strategic flexibility in managing such a large portfolio indicates a sophisticated understanding of market dynamics and liquidity. Why Do These Bitcoin OG Deposits Matter? When a ""Bitcoin OG"" — a term for early adopters or long-term holders with substantial amounts of Bitcoin — makes such large movements, the market invariably pays close attention. Here’s why these substantial Bitcoin OG deposits are so important: Market Sentiment Indicator: Large deposits or sales can often signal a shift in confidence among major holders. Are they taking profits, rebalancing their portfolio, or preparing for a new market phase? Potential Liquidity Impact: Depositing such a large amount to an exchange often precedes a sale. This action could potentially increase sell-side pressure, which might influence Bitcoin’s short-term price. Whale Activity Insights: These individuals often possess deep insights into market trends or are reacting to significant macroeconomic or crypto-specific events. Their actions can sometimes precede broader market movements. The recent Bitcoin OG deposits could indicate a belief that current price levels offer an opportune moment for profit-taking or reallocation. Conversely, moving funds to a new address might suggest a desire for enhanced security or a preparation for long-term holding in a different wallet setup. Understanding the Market Impact of Bitcoin OG Deposits The immediate impact of these kinds of large-scale movements is often intense speculation within the crypto community. Traders and algorithms monitor whale activity closely, looking for any clues about future price action. If the deposited BTC is indeed sold, it could lead to a temporary dip in price due to increased supply on the exchange. However, the market’s ability to absorb such a sale depends heavily on current demand and overall market conditions. Historically, significant Bitcoin OG deposits have sometimes coincided with local price tops, as these early holders capitalize on market rallies. However, it’s crucial to remember that one whale’s actions do not definitively dictate the entire market’s direction. The broader economic landscape, evolving regulatory news, and institutional adoption trends also play a massive role in shaping Bitcoin’s trajectory. What’s Next for Bitcoin OG Deposits and the Market? The crypto community will undoubtedly be watching this address closely for further movements. Will the remaining 799 BTC transferred to the new address remain dormant, or is it destined for another strategic move? The strategic use of both centralized exchanges (CEXs) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) by this Bitcoin OG highlights a nuanced and sophisticated approach to managing their digital assets, emphasizing flexibility and access to different liquidity pools. For everyday investors, this event serves as an important reminder to always consider the bigger picture. While whale movements can certainly create short-term volatility, Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition remains tied to its fundamental principles, increasing adoption, and inherent scarcity. Keep an eye on reliable on-chain data for clues, but always avoid making impulsive decisions based on single events alone. In conclusion, the substantial Bitcoin OG deposits to Binance represent a fascinating development, underscoring the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the crypto market. Whether these moves signal profit-taking, strategic portfolio restructuring, or something else entirely, they certainly provide a compelling narrative for observation. Understanding these large-scale transactions helps us appreciate the intricate dance of supply and demand that continuously shapes the exciting world of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is a Bitcoin OG? A Bitcoin OG (Original Gangster) refers to an early adopter or long-term holder of Bitcoin who possesses a substantial amount of the cryptocurrency, often acquired years ago. Q2: Why are large Bitcoin deposits to exchanges significant? Large deposits to exchanges are significant because they often precede a potential sale. This can increase the available supply on the market, potentially leading to price volatility or downward pressure. Q3: What is Hyperliquid (HYPE)? Hyperliquid (HYPE) is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that allows users to trade various cryptocurrencies. Its use by a Bitcoin OG highlights the growing importance of DEXs alongside traditional centralized exchanges. Q4: How do whale movements like these Bitcoin OG deposits affect Bitcoin’s price? Whale movements can cause short-term price fluctuations. Large deposits often create sell-side pressure, while significant withdrawals might suggest a holder intends to HODL, potentially indicating bullish sentiment. Q5: Should individual investors react immediately to every Bitcoin whale movement? While whale movements offer valuable insights, individual investors should avoid making impulsive decisions. It’s crucial to consider the broader market context, long-term fundamentals, and personal investment strategy rather than reacting to single events.

This substantial accumulation has ignited widespread discussion and intense speculation across the market. Let’s delve deeply into the specifics of this latest move and explore its potential ramifications for the future trajectory of Bitcoin. What’s Behind This Latest Bitcoin Whale Move? Leading crypto analytics platform Lookonchain recently brought to light a significant transaction that underscores the persistent activity of a major investor. An unknown entity, aptly termed a Bitcoin whale due to their profound influence and immense holdings, acquired an additional 455 BTC. This single purchase alone commanded a value of an impressive $50.75 million, all transacted within a remarkably short span of just 20 hours. This particular acquisition is not an isolated incident but rather a continuation of a broader accumulation strategy. The same enigmatic investor has been consistently active in the market since mid-July. Since July 18, this dedicated Bitcoin whale has methodically amassed a grand total of 2,419 BTC. This cumulative acquisition translates to an astounding $280 million in value. Such sustained and significant buying patterns from a single, large holder are unequivocally noteworthy, indicating a clear strategic intent. The Enigma of the Anonymous Bitcoin Whale: A Deep Dive The identity of this anonymous Bitcoin whale remains shrouded in mystery, adding a compelling layer of intrigue to these large-scale financial movements. In the cryptocurrency realm, “whales” are generally defined as individual or institutional investors who possess such substantial amounts of a particular cryptocurrency that their buying or selling actions can materially influence market prices and sentiment. Their anonymity, while common in decentralized finance, means that market observers can only analyze their on-chain behavior. These consistent, large-scale purchases often serve as a strong indicator of profound conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. Furthermore, a sustained pattern of accumulation, rather than sporadic trades, suggests a deliberate, strategic, and often bullish, approach to the market, rather than mere short-term speculation. Why Do Bitcoin Whale Movements Matter So Much? The activities of a prominent Bitcoin whale invariably send significant ripples throughout the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. When a whale embarks on an accumulation phase, it typically broadcasts a powerful bullish signal to the wider market. This can, in turn, inspire considerable confidence among smaller retail investors, potentially stimulating increased demand and contributing to upward price pressure. Conversely, the execution of massive selling orders by whales has historically been observed to trigger market downturns, introducing significant volatility. Consequently, diligently tracking these substantial movements offers invaluable insights into potential forthcoming market shifts and sentiment changes. This specific whale’s unwavering buying spree, for instance, strongly points towards a sustained positive outlook for BTC, signaling potential long-term growth. Key Impacts of Whale Activity: Market Confidence Boost: Large, consistent purchases often bolster investor morale and belief in the asset. Supply Dynamics Shift: Aggressive accumulation effectively reduces the available circulating supply of Bitcoin, potentially increasing scarcity. Price Momentum Influence: Sustained buying pressure from a whale can significantly contribute to positive price momentum and market stability. Liquidity Considerations: While buying adds liquidity on one side, a sudden large sell-off could challenge market liquidity. Navigating the Waters: What This Means for Every Investor For everyday investors, gaining an understanding of significant Bitcoin whale activity is undeniably crucial. While it would be imprudent to blindly mimic their every move, their actions provide an invaluable window into the strategic perspectives of the market’s most influential players. This current, ongoing accumulation phase strongly suggests a deep-seated belief in Bitcoin’s future growth and its role as a store of value. However, it is paramount to remember that the cryptocurrency market’s dynamics are incredibly intricate and multifaceted. Whale movements represent just one variable among many influencing Bitcoin’s price. Prudent investors should always conduct their own thorough research, consider a diversified portfolio strategy, and carefully assess their individual risk tolerance before committing to any investment decisions. The market is unpredictable, and even whales can make moves that don’t always align with immediate price increases. Actionable Insights for Investors: Observe, Don’t Blindly Follow: Use whale movements as indicators of sentiment, not direct buy/sell signals. Diversify Your Portfolio: Never put all your eggs in one basket, even with promising assets. Conduct Due Diligence: Always research projects thoroughly and understand their fundamentals. Manage Risk: Only invest what you can afford to lose and set clear entry and exit strategies. In conclusion, the relentless and significant accumulation by this anonymous Bitcoin whale represents a compelling development within the crypto landscape. Their consistent, multi-million dollar purchases of BTC unequivocally underscore a powerful and enduring conviction in the digital asset’s future. While their precise identity remains elusive, their tangible impact on overall market sentiment and supply dynamics is undeniable, vividly highlighting the ever-present and profound influence of major players in the dynamic and often volatile world of cryptocurrency. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About Bitcoin Whales Q1: What exactly is a Bitcoin whale? A1: A Bitcoin whale is an individual or entity holding a very large amount of Bitcoin, typically enough to significantly influence market prices through their buying or selling actions. Q2: How do we know about anonymous whale movements? A2: Blockchain technology is transparent. While the identity of the holder remains anonymous, crypto analytics firms like Lookonchain can track large transactions and wallet movements on the public ledger. Q3: Does whale accumulation always mean Bitcoin’s price will go up? A3: Not always, but it often indicates strong bullish sentiment among major holders. Consistent accumulation can contribute to price increases by reducing circulating supply and boosting confidence, but other market factors also play a role. Q4: Should I invest based on whale activity? A4: Whale activity can be a useful indicator of market sentiment, but it should not be the sole basis for investment decisions. Always conduct your own research, diversify your portfolio, and understand the risks involved. Q5: What are the risks associated with Bitcoin whale movements? A5: While accumulation can be positive, large whales can also sell off significant portions of their holdings, potentially causing sudden price drops and increased market volatility.

MATIC, Dogecoin and VET Named Top 3 Smart Altcoin Investments",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/buy-the-dip-matic-dogecoin-and-vet-named-top-3-smart-altcoin-investments/,"Crypto markets often present golden chances during dips, and altcoins with real utility or strong community demand tend to recover fastest. MATIC, VeChain, Dogecoin, and MAGACOIN Finance are now drawing smart money attention, each offering unique drivers ranging from blockchain adoption to whale accumulation and bonus offers. Polygon (MATIC) Riding the POL Migration Wave Polygon completed its transition from MATIC to POL in 2024, bringing clarity to tokenomics and solidifying POL as the network’s settlement asset. The next big upgrade is the AggLayer rollout, designed to link multiple blockchains into a unified liquidity layer by the end of 2025. In July, Polygon processed $2.56 billion in stablecoin payments, a clear indicator of growing real-world demand, while its $1.23 billion in TVL continues to highlight network adoption. With migration behind it, Polygon now focuses on scaling adoption through DeFi and cross-chain applications. VeChain (VET) Builds Utility With Real-World Adoption VeChain continues to focus on enterprise integration and real-world use cases. Its recent cross-chain connection with Wanchain improves interoperability, expanding DeFi possibilities. Meanwhile, the StarGate staking program has already locked over $125 million in VET, signaling strong engagement from the community and tightening circulating supply. Known for its supply chain partnerships and enterprise applications, VeChain maintains steady development even during market cooldowns. As demand for scalable blockchain infrastructure grows, VET stands out as a practical and utility-driven altcoin to consider on dips. Dogecoin (DOGE) Holds Ground as a Market Favorite Dogecoin remains one of the most visible and liquid digital assets, regularly ranking in the top 10 by trading volume. Its merge-mined structure with Litecoin continues to strengthen security, while its global community ensures ongoing engagement and adoption. Despite short-term pullbacks, DOGE often recovers quickly due to its high visibility and consistent demand from retail and institutional participants alike. As a large-cap altcoin with a strong identity in the market, Dogecoin continues to be a smart money pick during corrections. MAGACOIN Finance Offers 50% Extra Bonus With Code PATRIOT50X MAGACOIN Finance has been highlighted as one of the best altcoins to buy now, with whale activity pointing toward growing smart money interest. The project has announced a 50% EXTRA BONUS for buyers who use the code PATRIOT50X, adding urgency for those tracking early entry opportunities. Analysts have linked MAGACOIN to ROI-driven strategies, with traders eyeing its mix of meme appeal and DeFi utility as a recipe for long-term traction. With FOMO building around its presale, MAGACOIN is gaining visibility as a candidate for outsized returns. What Should Traders Do Next? Buying on dips remains one of the simplest strategies to position ahead of recovery phases. For traders looking beyond the usual names, MAGACOIN Finance’s bonus offer makes it worth a closer look.

This particular whale transferred a staggering 2,221 BTC, an amount currently valued at approximately $250 million, to a brand-new address. This move, reported by AmberCN just hours after it happened, has naturally sparked considerable discussion and speculation among market participants and analysts alike. What Does a Dormant Bitcoin Whale’s Awakening Signify? When we talk about a “ Bitcoin whale ,” we are referring to an individual or entity holding a very large amount of Bitcoin. These holders often possess enough crypto to potentially influence market prices with their transactions. The term “dormant” indicates that the address has shown no activity for an extended period, in this case, five years. Therefore, any movement from such an address is always closely watched. The sudden transfer of such a substantial amount of BTC raises immediate questions. Is this a precursor to selling? Is it merely a strategic repositioning of assets? Or could it be something entirely different? Understanding the implications of such large-scale movements is crucial for anyone monitoring the volatile crypto landscape. The Intrigue Behind This Massive BTC Transfer The mystery surrounding this particular Bitcoin whale is profound. For half a decade, these 2,221 Bitcoins sat untouched, a digital treasure quietly accumulating value. Now, their movement suggests a deliberate decision by the owner. While the identity of the whale remains unknown, such large holdings are typically associated with early adopters, institutional investors, or perhaps even a recovery of forgotten access keys. Why choose now to move these funds? The current market conditions, characterized by recent price volatility and renewed institutional interest, could play a role. Some speculate it might be a move to secure assets in a new, more secure wallet, or to prepare for potential over-the-counter (OTC) sales that wouldn’t directly impact exchange prices. However, without further on-chain data, these remain educated guesses. How Do Bitcoin Whale Movements Impact the Market? Historically, significant movements by large holders, especially a Bitcoin whale , can send ripples through the market. When a large amount of BTC is transferred, especially to an exchange address, it can signal an intent to sell. This potential increase in supply could exert downward pressure on prices. Conversely, a transfer to a new, non-exchange address might indicate a long-term holding strategy or a private transaction, which has less immediate market impact. Key considerations for market watchers include: Liquidity: A large sale could temporarily absorb market liquidity. Sentiment: Whale movements often influence investor sentiment, leading to either fear or optimism. Supply Dynamics: Any significant shift in held supply can affect price equilibrium. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts For those invested in or observing the crypto market, a major Bitcoin whale transfer like this offers a moment for reflection rather than panic. It is essential to differentiate between a transfer to a new address and a transfer to an exchange for sale. On-chain analytics tools can often provide more granular details on the destination of funds, offering clearer insights into the whale’s intentions. Here are some practical takeaways: Stay Informed: Follow reliable crypto news sources and on-chain analytics platforms. Avoid Impulse Decisions: Do not react solely based on single whale movements. Consider broader market trends. Diversify: A diversified portfolio helps mitigate risks associated with sudden market shifts. Understand the “Why”: Always seek to understand the potential reasons behind major transfers before drawing conclusions. In conclusion, the awakening of this long-dormant Bitcoin whale and its massive 2,221 BTC transfer is a compelling reminder of the dynamic and often mysterious nature of the cryptocurrency market. While the immediate implications are subject to speculation, it underscores the importance of monitoring on-chain activity. This event serves as a crucial data point for market participants, prompting a deeper look into potential shifts in market dynamics. Only time will tell the true impact of this fascinating movement. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is a “Bitcoin whale”? A1: A Bitcoin whale refers to an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of Bitcoin, typically enough to potentially influence market prices with their transactions. There’s no official threshold, but it generally means thousands of BTC. Q2: Why do dormant whales suddenly move their BTC? A2: Reasons vary, but common motivations include repositioning assets for better security, preparing for over-the-counter (OTC) sales, diversifying portfolios, or even recovering access to previously lost keys. It’s rarely a single, simple reason. Q3: Does this 2,221 BTC transfer mean the Bitcoin will be sold? A3: Not necessarily. A transfer to a new address could simply be a change of wallet for security or organizational purposes. If the funds move to an exchange address, the likelihood of a sale increases, but it’s not guaranteed. Q4: How does Bitcoin whale activity generally affect the market? A4: Significant whale movements can impact market sentiment and liquidity. Large transfers to exchanges might signal potential selling pressure, which could lead to price dips. Conversely, accumulation by whales can be seen as a bullish signal, indicating confidence in future price appreciation. Q5: Should investors be concerned about this specific transfer? A5: While any large Bitcoin whale movement warrants attention, it’s crucial to avoid panic. Investors should monitor subsequent movements, consult on-chain analytics, and consider broader market trends rather than reacting solely to a single transaction. Diversification and a long-term perspective are always advisable. Did this intriguing Bitcoin whale movement spark your curiosity about crypto market dynamics?

TRON, Toncoin, and Cardano are showing steady traction, while presale projects remain the area where the highest potential gains are often found. History shows that early entries can deliver the kind of upside that defines entire cycles. This time, BlockDAG (BDAG) has emerged as the standout presale story of the year. With over $383 million raised and Batch 29 pricing set at $0.0276, BlockDAG is quickly approaching its $600M target. Its structure, adoption progress, and presale success are already sparking debate about whether it could become one of the top rated crypto before its mainnet debut. BlockDAG (BDAG): Momentum Building Toward 35x Gains BlockDAG’s presale has gone from quiet growth to one of the most talked-about events of 2025. Raising $383 million so far has placed it well on its way to hitting the $600M goal, making it one of the largest presale fundraisers in recent years. At the current Batch 29 price of $0.0276, early participation is being compared with rare opportunities of past cycles, as projections point to a $1 listing price and a potential 35x return. Its strength lies not only in numbers but in its foundation. By combining Proof-of-Work with Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology, BlockDAG brings together scalability and security, two features that most Layer 1 projects struggle to balance. This gives it the technical base needed to challenge established names. Adoption is also moving fast. The X1 mobile miner app has already onboarded 2.5 million users, while 19,300 ASIC miners sold show large-scale participation at the industrial level. Partnerships in the sports sector are further expanding visibility. While many projects build traction after launch, BlockDAG (BDAG) is proving that it can create momentum even before its mainnet goes live. For those analyzing the top rated crypto in 2025, BlockDAG has positioned itself as a serious contender with both hype and measurable progress. TRON (TRX): Whale Demand Shapes the Trend TRON is attracting big money, with whale accumulation topping 1.3 billion TRX. Trading at $0.358, the asset is pressing against key resistance at $0.42–$0.45. A clear breakout could push it toward $0.75 or even $1 in the coming months. The chain’s fundamentals are strong, with over 1.8 billion on-chain transactions recorded. Still, its upside appears limited compared to presale contenders like BlockDAG. When looking at the top rated crypto, TRON fits the needs of cautious buyers, while BlockDAG appeals to those eyeing larger growth opportunities. Toncoin (TON): Riding Telegram’s Ecosystem Wave Toncoin keeps building momentum through its Telegram-linked activity, highlighted by NFT drops such as Snoop Dogg’s collection, which sold nearly one million items in under an hour. At $3.48, TON is moving within an upward channel, supported by daily liquidity above $230 million. Its stability makes it attractive, but TON remains more of a gradual climber. For those satisfied with moderate returns, it works. Yet for those seeking sharper moves, BlockDAG’s presale excitement makes it stand out in the discussion of the top rated crypto this cycle. Cardano (ADA): Breakout Signals Fresh Momentum Cardano has staged a recovery, breaking its long downtrend and now holding above $0.94–$0.96. A golden cross and other bullish indicators suggest ADA could aim for $1.20 to $1.50 soon. Its DeFi ecosystem and loyal community continue to keep it relevant in the Layer-1 race. But when compared with BlockDAG’s projected 35x upside, ADA looks like the steadier but slower option. Analysts note that presales with proven adoption often outpace even strong chains, and BlockDAG’s traction is being discussed as one of the top rated crypto stories to watch in 2025. Final Takeaway The market today offers both safety and speculation. TRON benefits from whale activity, Toncoin thrives through Telegram’s ecosystem, and Cardano is riding a technical breakout. Each brings value to the table, but none match the scale of BlockDAG’s presale. With $383M raised at a price of $0.0276 in Batch 29, BlockDAG is already showing traction rather than just potential. Its hybrid DAG + Proof-of-Work design, 2.5 million mobile miners, and 19,300 ASIC units sold highlight its adoption. If post-listing projections of $1 hold, early participation could see 35x gains. That mix of momentum, adoption, and technology is why BlockDAG is increasingly being viewed as the top rated crypto of 2025 . In crypto, timing defines outcomes, and the window here is still open.

These tokens carry a unique appeal because their low entry point allows room for massive percentage gains — the type of returns that can turn small investments into life-changing sums. With altcoin season approaching, many traders see this as the perfect chance to buy the dip. Some are also turning their attention to new projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which analysts believe could be one of the surprise performers in this cycle. Cardano (ADA): The Academic Blockchain Cardano’s ADA has been a consistent name in the sub-$1 category, drawing attention for its research-driven development and peer-reviewed foundations. Built with a proof-of-stake system, ADA stands out as one of the most energy-efficient blockchains in operation. Why investors are excited about ADA: Its scientific approach to development has built a secure, scalable foundation. Smart contracts and DeFi capabilities expand its ecosystem. Staking rewards encourage long-term holding. A strong reputation as a sustainable blockchain positions it well for mainstream adoption. TRON (TRX): The Entertainment Network TRON’s TRX has carved its place in crypto by focusing on content, gaming, and entertainment. Its high-throughput, low-cost transactions have made it popular among developers and everyday users alike. Key factors behind TRON’s potential: Entertainment and content sharing remain central to its mission. Fast and cheap transactions attract developers and users. Strategic acquisitions , like BitTorrent, expand reach and adoption. Stablecoin integration gives TRON a strong role in payments and transfers. The MAGACOIN FINANCE Factor Beyond established players like ADA and TRX, emerging tokens are capturing attention — and MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the most talked about. The project has already raised millions in record time, and its limited early rounds are selling out quickly. Investors point to its expanding global community and ambitious roadmap as signs it could replicate the type of explosive gains seen in the early days of XRP. In fact, some forecasts suggest that a 15,000% gain is not out of the question if momentum continues, making MAGACOIN FINANCE one of the most compellin g under-the-radar plays this altcoin season. Building Wealth with Sub-$1 Altcoins While no coin guarantees millionaire status overnight, history shows that early positions in low-priced tokens can deliver exponential rewards when adoption accelerates. Both Cardano and TRON have strong fundamentals, while new contenders like MAGACOIN FINANCE bring the excitement of early-mover opportunities. The key for investors is to balance risk and reward by researching thoroughly, diversifying wisely, and acting before altseason fully takes off. For those bold enough to seize the moment, today’s cheap altcoins could be tomorrow’s life-changing investments.

50684688,564963,1756173619,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50684688.jpeg,Stock Exchanges Demand Crackdown On Crypto Tokenized Stocks–Reuters,https://bitcoinist.com/stock-exchanges-crackdown-crypto-tokenized-stocks/,"A coalition representing the world’s largest stock exchanges, has urged securities regulators to take decisive action against “tokenized stocks,” expressing concerns that these crypto assets pose new risks for investors and could undermine market integrity. WFE Urges SEC And Global Regulators In a letter obtained by Reuters, the World Federation of Exchanges (WFE) highlighted that tokenized equities, which are designed to represent shares in companies, do not confer actual shareholder rights to investors. Advocates argue that these cryptocurrencies can lower trading costs, accelerate settlement times, and allow for continuous trading. However, the WFE warns that they are “misleadingly marketed” as equivalent to traditional stocks , allegedly lacking the same rights and protections for investors. In a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO)—the WFE expressed alarm over the “proliferation” of brokers and crypto trading platforms offering these products. The letter stated, “These products are marketed as stock tokens or the equivalent to stocks when they are not,” emphasizing that the implications for issuers could be serious if these tokens fail. Banking Associations Clash With Crypto Advocates CEO of the World Federation of Exchanges, Nandini Sukumar, also noted that share issuers have voiced concerns about the potential reputational damage they could face if tokenized versions of their stocks falter in the market. The WFE is advocating for regulators to apply existing securities rules to tokenized assets, clarify the legal frameworks governing ownership and custody, and prevent these tokens from being marketed as direct substitutes for traditional stocks. Meanwhile, crypto trading platform Robinhood recently launched tokenized equities for European customers and has plans to introduce tokens representing shares in private companies, including OpenAI. However, OpenAI has distanced itself from the offering, stating it did not endorse the tokens. Coinbase is exploring the possibility of offering tokenized equities to its users and has requested approval from the SEC. Yet, the new regulatory environment in the US, stemming from President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance, has also brought scrutiny to other market sectors. In the aftermath of the recent enactment of the GENIUS Act, which introduces regulations for stablecoins, a notable rift has surfaced between traditional banking associations and cryptocurrency advocacy groups. As reported by Bitcoinist earlier this month, the GENIUS Act has raised concerns among banking representatives from all fifty states, who caution that the legislation may introduce vulnerabilities into the financial system. In response to these concerns, organizations such as the Blockchain association and the Crypto Council have voiced their opposition to proposed amendments to the law. These crypto advocates argue that the regulations should promote innovation and not stifle the growth of digital assets. For now, it remains uncertain how pro-crypto groups will address the recent allegations made by the World Federation of Exchanges (WFE) regarding tokenized stocks. How regulators will respond to both the World Federation of Exchange’s warnings and the pushback from crypto advocates will also be pivotal in shaping the future regulatory environment.

Related Reading: Solana Extends Streak, Outshines Ethereum in DEX Volume – Details Old Whales Hold Deep Profit According to Willy Woo, supply is tightly held by OG (“original gangster”) whales who built big positions around 2011 when Bitcoin traded at about $10. He warned that the gap in cost basis makes a difference: it now takes roughly $110,000 of fresh capital to absorb each Bitcoin those holders choose to sell. That math, he says, helps explain why price action has been slow even as overall market interest grows. According to market observers, a single whale’s rotation from Bitcoin into Ether helped trigger a rapid sell-off that briefly knocked roughly $45 billion off Bitcoin’s market cap. Why is BTC moving up so slowly this cycle? BTC supply is concentrated around OG whales who peaked their holdings in 2011 (orange and dark orange). They bought their BTC at $10 or lower. It takes $110k+ of new capital to absorb each BTC they sell. pic.twitter.com/7CbWXsvX2l — Willy Woo (@woonomic) August 24, 2025 Flash Crash Unfolded Quickly Based on reports, Bitcoin slid from $114,500to $112,980 in nine minutes, briefly touching $112,050, CoinMarketCap data shows. Ether fell 3.8% in the same window, dropping from $4,925 to $4,680. Prices later recovered about half of those losses. Traders point to a chain of transfers that set the move off. Whale Rotations And Large Transfers Blockchain.com records show that roughly 24,000 BTC — about $2.7 billion at the time — was sent to the decentralized perpetuals platform Hyperliquid across six transfers beginning Aug. 16. Of that sum, 18,142 BTC has been sold and much of the proceeds were rotated into 416,590 ETH, an analyst known as MLM reported. A chunk of those ETH — 275,500 — was staked, worth about $1.3 billion. Strategic Positioning And Big Gains It was also reported that the whale took on large leveraged positions, longing 135,260 ETH on Hyperliquid for a total exposure near 551,861 ETH, valued at more than $2.6 billion. That set up a trade that netted around $185 million, according to the same analyst. The longs boosted ETH prices as other traders followed the flows, and when the whale began closing positions, rapid reversals led to cascading sell orders. Related Reading: Ether Soars In August—But Will September Spoil The Party? Forces At Work Reports have disclosed the whale still controls 152,874 BTC across several addresses, and those funds originally moved off an exchange about six years ago. Market watchers say there are two forces at work: long-dormant holders sitting on massive unrealized gains, and active traders using large rotations to capture short-term moves. If more of the 152,874 BTC moves to market, sellers could test demand again. On the other hand, the amount of ETH being staked points to at least some longer-term intent from big players.

The analysts have pointed out three altcoins in particular, namely Solona, XMR and MAGACOIN FINANCE, while the major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are strong anchor points. Each illustrates a different facet of growth, whether through institutional adoption, ecosystem expansion, or high-upside presale momentum. Solana (SOL) — Strength in Scalability After a small decline of about 3% in the past 24 hours, Solana is grabbing institutional interest again near $177.70. Solana’s price took a dip, yet institutional inflows of over $176 million show that it remains a popular player in crypto. Additionally, DeFi, memecoin, and NFT activity are thriving. Analysts say Solana (SOL) may regain higher levels quickly if sentiment improves. Key support is around $175–$180, while resistance is at $185.95 and $200. Upgrades to the ecosystem, like Alpenglow, which will substantially reduce block finality times, are bullish for Solana’s long-term future. XRP — Positioned for Institutional Adoption XRP is staying strong and close to $3.00. In the last 24 hours, it has dropped 5% due to market ETF review delay and profit-taking. Multiple times support of $2.95 has held showing investors are not convinced even during a volatile session. Almost all XRP holders continue to enjoy similar profits, whale accumulation remains at notable levels, and institutional adoption will only accelerate further down the line. This will be due to regulatory clarity towards the end of the year. According to experts, the next breakout of XRP could occur above the $3.10-$3.55 resistance level, positioning it as one of the best altcoins for the upcoming cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE — The Breakout Presale Candidate Analysts are narrowing in on the top altcoins for the next bull run, with Solana and XRP ranking high — but MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the stronger breakout candidate. Forecasts indicate a 45x growth potential, and early PATRIOT50X buyers will secure a 50% extra presale bonus before allocations run out. Backed by whale inflows, scarcity-driven tokenomics, and a fast-moving presale, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly establishing itself as one of the most promising projects for 2025 . The combination of limited allocations, verified audits, and surging demand is creating urgency, with investors viewing it as a rare opportunity to secure high-multiple growth before listings. Analysts argue that its timing, aligned with both political narratives and shifting market cycles, positions it to rival the early days of SHIB or Solana during their initial surges. Conclusion — Aligning With the Next Cycle As the market prepares for the next major rally, Solana’s scalability, XRP’s institutional momentum and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s surging presale growth are drawing investor attention. Experts say MAGACOIN FINANCE has more upside than Solana and XRP. With predictions of a 45x growth and presale slots disappearing fast, it is one of the most discussed opportunities to secure before the next bull run takes shape.

World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a DeFi project with reported links to the Trump family, recently completed a substantial WLFI token transfer . This move involved a massive amount of tokens being sent to a specialized lockup address, signaling potential shifts within the project’s strategy and the broader market. What’s Behind This WLFI Token Transfer? Over the past five and a half hours, World Liberty Financial executed a major transaction. On-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa reported that 6.55 billion WLFI tokens were transferred to a designated lockup address. This represents a substantial 6.55% of the total WLFI supply. Total Tokens Transferred: 6.55 billion WLFI Percentage of Total Supply: 6.55% Current Valuation: Approximately $1.5 billion Origin: The transfer originated from the top and eighth-largest WLFI holding addresses. This move is not just a simple transaction; it’s a strategic decision that could have wide-ranging implications for the WLFI ecosystem and its community. Why Does a WLFI Lockup Matter So Much? When a project performs a WLFI token transfer to a lockup address, it typically means these tokens are removed from circulation for a set period. This action is significant for several reasons: Reduced Circulating Supply: Locking up a large number of tokens effectively decreases the available supply in the market. Consequently, this could impact market dynamics. Increased Trust and Stability: Token lockups often demonstrate a project’s long-term commitment. It signals to investors that core holders are not looking to sell their tokens immediately, fostering greater confidence. Price Stability: By preventing large amounts of tokens from being dumped on the market, lockups can help reduce price volatility and support more stable growth. Therefore, this substantial WLFI lockup could be a strong indicator of World Liberty Financial’s future intentions. Understanding Token Lockups in DeFi Token lockups are a common strategy in the DeFi space. They serve multiple purposes, from vesting schedules for team members to securing liquidity for decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Generally, a lockup address is a smart contract designed to hold tokens for a predetermined duration or until certain conditions are met. This mechanism helps to: Align Incentives: It ensures that project developers and early investors have a vested interest in the long-term success of the project. Prevent Market Manipulation: Large token holders cannot suddenly flood the market with their holdings, which protects smaller investors. Support Project Development: Locked tokens might be designated for future development, marketing, or community incentives, ensuring resources are available over time. The recent WLFI token transfer to a lockup address aligns with these common practices, suggesting a deliberate strategic move. What’s the Broader Impact on World Liberty Financial? The decision by World Liberty Financial to execute such a large WLFI token transfer to a lockup address could have several impacts on the project. For a DeFi project reportedly linked to a high-profile family, transparency and stability are paramount. This move could: Enhance Credibility: By demonstrating a commitment to long-term value, WLFI might attract more serious investors and users. Spark Community Discussion: The community will undoubtedly analyze what this lockup means for WLFI’s future roadmap, tokenomics, and governance. Influence Market Perception: While a lockup often implies stability, the sheer size of this transfer and the project’s background will keep the market watching closely. As the DeFi landscape evolves, such strategic token movements are closely scrutinized for their potential to shape a project’s trajectory. In conclusion, the WLFI token transfer of $1.5 billion to a lockup address marks a significant moment for World Liberty Financial. This action, involving 6.55% of the total supply, signals a strong commitment to long-term stability and strategic growth within the DeFi ecosystem. As the crypto community watches, the implications of this massive lockup will undoubtedly unfold, influencing market sentiment and the project’s future trajectory. It underscores the importance of transparency and strategic planning in the dynamic world of decentralized finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a token lockup? A token lockup involves sending cryptocurrency tokens to a smart contract address that prevents them from being sold or moved for a specified period. This action is typically done to reduce circulating supply, demonstrate long-term commitment, or secure project funds. Why did World Liberty Financial execute this WLFI token transfer? While the project has not issued an official statement detailing the exact reasons, a large WLFI token transfer to a lockup address usually indicates a strategic move to foster long-term stability, reduce market volatility, and signal commitment to the project’s future development. How does this lockup affect the WLFI token price? By reducing the circulating supply of WLFI tokens, a lockup can potentially create scarcity, which might lead to upward price pressure. However, market prices are influenced by many factors, so this is not a guarantee. Who reported this significant WLFI token transfer? The substantial WLFI token transfer was initially reported by on-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa, who tracks blockchain transactions and provides insights into large movements of digital assets. What are the benefits of token lockups for investors? For investors, token lockups can signify a project’s dedication, reduce the risk of large token dumps by major holders, and potentially contribute to a more stable and predictable token price environment over time.

This sudden move has ignited a fierce debate about the independence of the central bank and its profound implications for global economic stability. For anyone invested in the intricate dance of currencies, commodities, or even cryptocurrencies, understanding this development is not just important—it’s essential for navigating the uncertain waters ahead. Understanding the Immediate US Dollar Dip: What Just Happened? The news broke with startling speed, catching many market participants off guard. The firing of a sitting Federal Reserve Governor, especially under such politically charged circumstances, is a rare occurrence that signals potential interference in the central bank’s operations. Markets, which crave stability and predictability, reacted swiftly and negatively to this perceived threat to institutional independence. Here’s a breakdown of the immediate fallout: Currency Volatility: The US dollar , often seen as a safe-haven asset, weakened against a basket of major currencies. This immediate depreciation reflects investor apprehension regarding future economic policy and political stability in the United States. Investor Uncertainty: The move introduced a significant layer of uncertainty into the financial landscape. Investors began to question the future direction of US economic policy and the autonomy of the Federal Reserve. Risk-Off Sentiment: While not a full-blown panic, there was a noticeable shift towards a more cautious, ‘risk-off’ sentiment, impacting various asset classes globally. The Sacred Independence of the Federal Reserve : A Core Principle Under Threat? The Federal Reserve, America’s central bank, operates with a degree of independence from political influence. This independence is considered crucial for its ability to make sound, data-driven decisions on monetary policy without succumbing to short-term political pressures. Its dual mandate—to achieve maximum employment and stable prices—requires a long-term perspective that can often conflict with immediate political goals. Why is this independence so vital? Credibility: An independent Federal Reserve is perceived as more credible, ensuring that its decisions are based on economic fundamentals rather than political expediency. Long-Term Stability: It allows the Fed to implement policies that may be unpopular in the short run but are necessary for long-term economic health, such as raising interest rates to combat inflation. Market Confidence: Markets rely on the Fed’s impartiality. Any perceived political interference can erode confidence, leading to capital flight and economic instability. The dismissal of Governor Cook has opened a Pandora’s box, raising serious questions about the future autonomy of the institution and whether it will be able to maintain its traditional distance from political machinations. This is a critical development for anyone watching global financial markets, as the integrity of the Federal Reserve directly impacts the stability of the US dollar and, by extension, the global financial system. Navigating the Turbulent Forex Market : How Traders Are Responding The forex market , the world’s largest and most liquid financial market, was the first to register the tremors from this political shake-up. Currency pairs involving the US dollar experienced heightened volatility, with traders reacting to the new political risk premium. For traders, this event presents both challenges and potential opportunities: Increased Volatility: Sudden political developments inject unpredictability. Traders who thrive on volatility might find new avenues, but risk management becomes paramount. Shifting Fundamentals: The traditional drivers of currency movements—interest rate differentials, economic growth, trade balances—are now overshadowed by political uncertainty. Safe-Haven Flows: While the US dollar itself dipped, other traditional safe-haven currencies like the Japanese Yen and Swiss Franc saw increased demand, reflecting a broader flight to perceived safety. Example: Initial USD Performance Against Major Currencies Currency Pair Initial Reaction (Change) Implied Sentiment EUR/USD Upward Movement Euro strengthens against USD USD/JPY Downward Movement Yen strengthens against USD GBP/USD Upward Movement Pound strengthens against USD This immediate shift in the forex market underscores how quickly political actions can translate into tangible economic consequences, affecting everything from import costs to investment returns. The Shifting Sands of Monetary Policy : What’s Next for Interest Rates? The core concern stemming from this event revolves around the future trajectory of monetary policy . Governor Cook’s departure, especially if followed by the appointment of a politically aligned successor, could signal a significant deviation from the current policy path. This could have profound implications for interest rates, inflation, and economic growth. Key questions arise: Interest Rate Outlook: Will the Fed’s stance on interest rate hikes or cuts become more susceptible to political pressure? A more dovish (lower interest rates) or hawkish (higher interest rates) tilt, driven by non-economic factors, could destabilize markets. Inflation Management: If the Fed’s independence is compromised, its ability to effectively combat inflation through conventional tools might be weakened, potentially leading to higher price levels over time. Quantitative Easing/Tightening: Future decisions regarding the Fed’s balance sheet—whether to expand or contract it—could also come under political scrutiny, affecting liquidity and credit conditions. The very foundation of predictable monetary policy , which global markets rely on for stability, appears to be shaken. Businesses and consumers alike will be watching closely for any signs of a change in direction, as these decisions directly impact borrowing costs, investment decisions, and economic growth prospects. Beyond Currencies: Analyzing the Broader Market Reaction While the forex market was the immediate battleground, the ripple effects of this development extend far beyond currency trading. The broader market reaction encompasses equities, bonds, commodities, and even the increasingly interconnected world of cryptocurrencies. Consider the wider implications: Equity Markets: Increased political uncertainty and concerns about future monetary policy can lead to stock market volatility. Sectors sensitive to interest rates, such as technology and real estate, could be particularly affected. Bond Markets: Government bond yields might react to changes in inflation expectations and the perceived creditworthiness of the US government, especially if fiscal and monetary policies become misaligned. Commodities: A weaker US dollar typically makes dollar-denominated commodities like gold and oil more attractive to international buyers. Gold, a traditional safe haven, often sees demand increase during periods of political and economic uncertainty. Cryptocurrencies: For the crypto market, a weakening US dollar can have mixed effects. While some might view Bitcoin as an alternative safe haven, increased global financial instability could also lead to broader risk-off sentiment, impacting all speculative assets. Stablecoins, largely pegged to the US dollar , could face questions about their underlying stability if the dollar itself becomes more volatile due to political influence. The interconnectedness of global finance means that a significant event impacting the US central bank and its currency inevitably sends shockwaves across all asset classes, prompting investors to re-evaluate their portfolios and risk exposures. Challenges and Risks Ahead The path forward is fraught with challenges and risks: Erosion of Trust: A sustained perception of political interference in the Federal Reserve could erode public and market trust in its ability to manage the economy effectively. Policy Inconsistency: Frequent shifts in monetary policy due to political pressure could lead to policy inconsistencies, making it harder for businesses and consumers to plan for the future. Global Economic Instability: Given the US dollar ‘s role as the world’s primary reserve currency, any significant instability or loss of confidence in it could trigger broader global economic instability. Opportunities for Savvy Investors Despite the risks, periods of market disruption can also present opportunities: Diversification: Re-evaluating portfolio diversification, potentially increasing exposure to non-dollar assets or currencies that are less susceptible to US political shifts. Hedging Strategies: Implementing currency hedging strategies to mitigate risks associated with US dollar volatility in the forex market . Alternative Assets: Exploring alternative assets, including certain cryptocurrencies that may offer uncorrelated returns or act as a hedge against traditional financial system instability, though with their own inherent risks. Actionable Insights for Navigating Uncertainty In times like these, informed decision-making is crucial. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on political developments in the US and statements from the Federal Reserve . Understanding the nuances will be key. Review Your Portfolio: Assess your exposure to US dollar -denominated assets and consider adjustments based on your risk tolerance and investment goals. Embrace Flexibility: The market environment may remain volatile. Being adaptable and ready to adjust your strategies will be an advantage. Focus on Long-Term Goals: While short-term fluctuations can be alarming, maintaining a focus on long-term investment objectives can help weather the storm. Compelling Summary: A New Era of Financial Uncertainty? The firing of Fed Governor Cook by Donald Trump is more than just a political headline; it’s a seismic event that has immediately impacted the US dollar and sent a chilling message across global financial markets. It underscores a growing concern about the independence of the Federal Reserve and the potential for political influence to dictate monetary policy . The immediate market reaction , particularly in the forex market , highlights the fragility of investor confidence when institutional integrity is questioned. As we move forward, market participants will be keenly observing how this event shapes the future of US economic policy and its far-reaching consequences for global stability. The era of predictable central banking may be giving way to a more politically charged and uncertain landscape, demanding greater vigilance and strategic agility from all investors.

This achievement not only strengthens BNB’s role in the market but also signals that capital is flowing beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum into the broader altcoin ecosystem. Many investors believe this momentum could trigger a powerful rally across multiple altcoins. During times like these, smart investors are also scouting emerging projects that could deliver outsized returns. MAGACOIN FINANCE, for example, is gaining attention for offering a 50x opportunity for early participants before major exchange listings , positioning itself as one of the most attractive plays in today’s market. XRP: Regulatory Clarity Could Unlock Growth XRP remains one of the most closely watched assets in the crypto world. Despite recent price struggles, including a 17% monthly decline, the long-term outlook is optimistic. The XRP Ledger continues to grow in usage for payments and real-world asset tokenization. The ongoing lawsuit with the SEC is the biggest wildcard, but once resolved, it could open the floodgates for institutional adoption. In a bullish scenario, analysts see XRP potentially hitting the $4.00–$6.50 range , fueled by regulatory clarity and increasing utility. Toncoin (TON): A Telegram-Backed Powerhouse Toncoin’s close ties with Telegram give it one of the most compelling adoption cases in the industry. With Telegram’s massive user base now experimenting with wallet integration and TON-based services, demand could rise quickly. Institutional accumulation has also begun, with firms mirroring strategies once used for Bitcoin treasuries. TON’s price, consolidating around $3.00–$3.50 , may be at the edge of a breakout if Telegram’s ecosystem integration expands further or new DeFi applications emerge on the network. Litecoin (LTC): Digital Silver with a Fresh Edge Litecoin has long been known as “digital silver” and has a history of outperforming during bullish phases. Though it hasn’t reached fresh all-time highs like BNB, LTC’s consistent network reliability, low fees, and strong brand recognition make it a safe bet for many institutional investors.

In a truly remarkable feat, the decentralized exchange (DEX) recorded an astounding Hyperliquid trading volume of $330.8 billion in July. This figure, as reported by CryptoSlate, is not just a number; it represents a significant milestone for the entire DeFi ecosystem. To put this into perspective, Hyperliquid’s July performance was over 39% higher than the trading volume of traditional brokerage giant Robinhood, which stood at $237.8 billion for the same period. This comparison highlights a crucial shift in investor preference and the growing maturity of decentralized platforms. It signals that users are increasingly trusting and utilizing DEXs for their trading needs. What’s Driving Hyperliquid’s Astounding Hyperliquid Trading Volume?

A Closer Look at the Numbers: Hyperliquid Trading Volume vs. Traditional Finance The comparison between Hyperliquid’s $330.8 billion and Robinhood’s $237.8 billion is more than just a statistic; it’s a testament to the evolving financial landscape. Robinhood, a household name in traditional and crypto brokerage, serves millions of users with a wide array of investment products. Yet, a relatively newer decentralized platform has managed to outpace it in monthly trading activity. This remarkable surge in Hyperliquid trading volume demonstrates several important trends: DeFi’s Maturation: Decentralized finance is no longer a niche market; it is becoming a formidable force capable of competing with established financial institutions. Investor Demand: There is a clear and growing demand for decentralized trading solutions that offer greater control, transparency, and often, better financial terms. Technological Advancement: The underlying technology of DEXs like Hyperliquid is proving its scalability and reliability under immense trading pressure. Consequently, this performance suggests a potential shift in how global finance operates, with decentralized models gaining significant traction. Navigating the DeFi Landscape: Challenges and Opportunities for Hyperliquid While the July Hyperliquid trading volume is undoubtedly a triumph, the path ahead for decentralized exchanges is not without its challenges. Regulatory scrutiny remains a significant hurdle, as governments worldwide grapple with how to classify and oversee DeFi platforms. Security is another constant concern, as smart contract vulnerabilities can lead to substantial losses. However, the opportunities for Hyperliquid and the broader DeFi sector are immense. Continued innovation in areas like: Scalability Solutions: Enhancing transaction speed and reducing costs. User Onboarding: Making DeFi more accessible to mainstream users. Interoperability: Connecting with other blockchain networks to expand offerings. These developments could further propel Hyperliquid’s growth.

This strategic acquisition signals strong confidence in Ethereum’s future, adding considerable value to their already impressive digital asset portfolio. This latest investment highlights a growing trend of institutional players deepening their involvement in the Ethereum ecosystem. It’s not just about accumulating assets; it’s about positioning for long-term growth and stability within the digital economy. What’s Behind Bitmain’s Latest ETH Purchase? Bitmain has once again made headlines with its recent acquisition of an additional 4,871 ETH. This purchase, valued at approximately $21.28 million, was executed through FalconX, a well-known institutional crypto trading platform. This isn’t their first foray into large-scale Ethereum accumulation, and it certainly won’t be their last. According to Onchain Lens, this latest transaction brings Bitmain’s total Ethereum holdings to an astounding 1.72 million ETH.

Here’s why this move is particularly noteworthy: Institutional Confidence: It underscores a robust and long-term bullish outlook from a key industry participant on Ethereum’s future. Market Impact: Significant purchases by entities like Bitmain can influence market sentiment, potentially encouraging other institutional and retail investors.

Understanding Bitmain’s Strategic Vision with ETH Bitmain’s long-standing history in the crypto space, primarily known for its Bitcoin mining hardware, makes this sustained Bitmain ETH purchase particularly noteworthy.

This is a clear investment in the ecosystem’s future. The Broader Implications of Bitmain’s ETH Purchase This continuous Bitmain ETH purchase highlights a growing trend of major corporations accumulating significant digital assets. It moves beyond mere speculation, suggesting a fundamental belief in the intrinsic value and long-term utility of cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. The involvement of institutional-grade platforms like FalconX in facilitating these transactions also speaks volumes about the increasing maturity and professionalism of the crypto market. It makes large-scale asset acquisition more streamlined and secure for big players. Key Takeaways: Bitmain’s significant investment reinforces Ethereum’s position as a leading digital asset. It signals a strong institutional belief in ETH’s long-term growth and utility. The move reflects a strategic diversification of assets for a major crypto entity. Ultimately, this latest acquisition by Bitmain is more than just a transaction; it’s a testament to the evolving landscape of digital finance and the increasing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies as legitimate assets for corporate treasuries. Conclusion: A Powerful Vote of Confidence Bitmain’s decision to make an additional, substantial Bitmain ETH purchase from FalconX is a powerful vote of confidence in Ethereum. With holdings now totaling approximately 1.72 million ETH, valued at an impressive $7.6 billion, Bitmain is clearly doubling down on its belief in Ethereum’s future. This strategic move not only bolsters Bitmain’s own asset base but also sends a clear message to the wider crypto community about the enduring value and potential of the Ethereum network. It’s an exciting time to watch how these institutional plays continue to shape the market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Bitmain?

Speaking at Web3 Conference WebX 2025 in Tokyo, Kato said crypto could be a legitimate asset class if proper rules are in place. “While crypto assets carry the risk of high volatility, by establishing a proper investment environment, they can become an option for diversified investment,” Kato told attendees. He emphasized that Japan will focus on building a sound trading environment for digital assets as adoption expands. The remarks marked one of the most direct endorsements of crypto by a sitting Japanese finance minister. Push for Tax Reform Kato’s comments follow renewed calls from Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) to overhaul crypto taxation rules. Currently, crypto gains fall under “miscellaneous income” and are taxed at rates ranging from 15% to 56% depending on the income bracket. The FSA has asked the government to reclassify crypto gains under a flat tax system similar to stocks, with a rate of around 20.315%. Officials argue that this change would streamline tax reporting while encouraging wider adoption of cryptocurrencies within Japan’s financial system. The proposal reflects Japan’s gradual shift toward a more crypto-friendly regulatory stance. Growing Institutional Involvement The momentum has also been reflected in corporate activity. Bitcoin treasury firm Metaplanet has been upgraded from small-cap to mid-cap status under FTSE Russell’s Semi-Annual Review. The adjustment means Metaplanet is now included in the FTSE Japan Index, boosting its visibility among investors. At the same time, major Japanese financial groups are embracing blockchain partnerships. SBI Group has announced new collaborations with Circle, Ripple, and Web3 developer Startale. It also recently partnered with Chainlink to roll out crypto tools aimed at financial institutions across Asia. Such moves point to a growing recognition of blockchain as a key driver in the country’s financial innovation. Stablecoins on the Horizon Japan’s regulatory framework is also preparing for the introduction of yen-backed stablecoins. Reports suggest that the FSA could approve their issuance as early as this fall. The development would mark a significant milestone in Japan’s digital asset strategy, allowing consumers and businesses to transact with blockchain-based tokens tied to the national currency. Together, Kato’s remarks, proposed tax changes, and institutional adoption signal that Japan is positioning itself as a global hub for regulated crypto activity.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ASIA|REGULATION|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-08-26 02:50:01

Trump Family Pushed Into Crypto In a recent interview with The Wall Street Journal, Eric Trump detailed how financial institutions “made him” embrace the crypto industry, explaining that after the January 6, 2021, riot at the US Capitol, several banks cut the Trump family off. Trump shared that hundreds of accounts for the family’s business were shut down without an explicit reason, leaving the Trump Organization “debanked” and “scattering millions across accounts at regional banks before eventually migrating to a new bank,” which he did not name. “At that time, I realized how fragile the financial system was and how easily it could be weaponized against you,” he affirmed, arguing that the decisions were likely political, leading him to turn to the crypto industry. According to the interview, Eric Trump, executive vice president at the Trump Organization, began warming up to the industry during his father’s second presidential campaign, as he became aware of the struggles of crypto companies with banking services. Previously, he told CNBC that being “the most canceled company, probably on Earth,” is what drove the Trump family towards crypto, explaining that his entry into the industry wasn’t a financial bet but “a form of resistance.” “This whole system was weaponized against them, no different than it had been weaponized against us for different reasons,” Trump told the Wall Street Journal, noting that both conservatives and crypto firms have alleged that banks have denied them services for political or religious reasons. The Trump administration has made stopping the crackdown on the sector a top priority. Crypto industry leaders have accused the previous administration of using financial exclusion as a weapon against numerous companies and founders, in what many have named “Operation Chokepoint 2.0.” In December, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Hester Peirce urged the regulatory agency to “stop the chokepoint aspect of government regulation.” Since then, the Commission dropped its “regulation by enforcement” approach, launched its Crypto Task Force, and recently unveiled the “Project Crypto” initiative to modernize securities rules and regulations. Earlier this month, President Trump addressed this issue, signing an executive order that requires banks to ensure they do not refuse financial services based on political or religious beliefs and directs regulators to review all institutions for any discriminatory practices. A Gateway To Financial Freedom Eric Trump also addresses the conflicts of interest allegations, asserting that there’s a separation between the family’s crypto businesses and President Trump’s official businesses. “I literally have nothing to do with Washington, D.C.,” he affirmed. It’s worth noting that multiple US lawmakers have argued that the Trump family’s crypto ventures, including World Liberty Financial’s (WLFI) USD1 stablecoin and the official TRUMP memecoin, enable corruption and represent a threat to America’s financial system. Nonetheless, Trump said in the interview that memecoins serve as a “powerful gateway” for newcomers, arguing that “If somebody wants to go in and they want to buy $TRUMP, congratulations, now you have access to Bitcoin, you have access to Ethereum, you have access to USD1, you have access to the United States dollar.” You just took the first step in actually creating some financial freedom that I think so many people around the world want. He closed the interview discussing the benefits of tokenizing real-world assets (RWA). “Why is it that if I wanted to refinance Trump Tower, I couldn’t tokenize this asset and put it on the street for billions of people around the world to otherwise invest in it. They love New York. They love Fifth Avenue. They love Trump,” he concluded.",Crypto News|crypto industry|debanking|Donald Trump|Eric Trump|ETH|Ethereum|ETHUSDT|Operation Chokepoint 2.0|The Trump Organization|Trump memecoin|US President Donald Trump|WLFI,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|ETH|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-26 03:00:19
50686827,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=792220,1756177232,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50686827.jpeg,"Gas prices in Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin jumped up to 27 cents",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/gas-prices-surge-in-midwest/,"Gas prices just jumped across the Midwest after the Whiting refinery in Indiana, the largest inland crude facility in the U.S., shut down key units last Tuesday. The outage came after days of heavy rainfall and flash flooding in the area. The impact? Drivers in Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin started this week staring at pump prices that were up as much as 27 cents compared to last Monday. That data came from the American Automobile Association, which showed also that nationally, gas prices barely budged, rising just 2 cents, showing how isolated and regional the damage really is. BP managed to bring back one of its two primary processing units on Monday. But the partial restart didn’t ease any pressure. There’s simply not enough slack in the system. With Labor Day weekend starting in just a few days, and travel demand expected to spike, drivers in the region are likely stuck with high costs until at least mid-September. Whiting shutdown slams Midwest as Canton refinery stays offline The Whiting facility, owned by BP, has a capacity of 435,000 barrels per day, and when it goes down, it hits the region’s supply fast. And this time, things are even tighter because Marathon Petroleum’s refinery in Canton, Ohio, is also out. That plant, which processes 100,000 barrels per day, is undergoing scheduled maintenance that started earlier this month. The full turnaround is expected to last into early or mid-September. So now, the two most important regional plants are either down or running below normal capacity at the same time. On top of that, Midwest gasoline inventories are already low. They’re sitting below both last year’s levels and the five-year seasonal average. That’s made everything worse, and even a full Whiting restart wouldn’t have fixed it in time for Labor Day. It’s too late. The gas that’s already in the system is all there is for now. Meanwhile, oil futures just keep rising. Brent crude closed Monday at $68.80, up $1.07 or 1.58%. West Texas Intermediate ended the session at $64.80, climbing $1.14, or 1.79%. The rally has been building since last week and shows no sign of slowing down. The reason is the growing risk of supply disruption from Russia as the war in Ukraine continues to escalate. Sanctions, drone attacks and tariffs trigger more oil price pressure Tensions in Eastern Europe have bled straight into oil markets again. U.S. President Donald Trump said Friday that if peace talks between Russia and Ukraine don’t produce results within two weeks, Washington will impose more sanctions on Moscow. He also warned that India could face new tariffs for continuing to buy Russian crude. Trump’s approach has added pressure to an already fragile market that’s still reacting to physical attacks on Russian energy infrastructure. Over the weekend, U.S. Vice President JD Vance said Russia had made “significant concessions” toward a deal. But on the ground, that hasn’t stopped Ukraine from ramping up its drone strikes. On Sunday, a drone attack caused a huge fire at the Ust-Luga fuel terminal. Russian officials confirmed the blaze. Separately, a fire at the Novoshakhtinsk refinery, also linked to drone activity, was still burning on Sunday. That facility normally processes around 100,000 barrels per day for export. Even with these disruptions, Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, said their impact on supply is being balanced by OPEC+. The group has been slowly reversing its earlier production cuts and is now adding barrels back into the market. Eight members of OPEC+ are meeting on September 7 and are expected to approve another production increase. That’s not the only market-moving event on the calendar. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled on Friday that the Fed might cut interest rates in September. That’s given investors a boost in risk appetite. But not everyone’s optimistic. Priyanka Sachdeva, a senior market analyst at Phillip Nova, said both oil benchmarks still look flat. She added that markets believe Trump’s tariffs will eventually hurt global growth, which could slow down fuel demand.

At the time of writing, ETH trades around $4,655, representing an 8.2% gain over the past week. This rally comes after three years of consolidation below its former peak, marking a significant moment for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Unsurprisingly, Ethereum’s upward momentum has also shifted market sentiment, placing most ETH holders back in profit. The latest movement has been tied not only to retail activity but also to growing institutional participation. Analysts argue that this demand could be a major factor supporting Ethereum’s renewed market strength. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Demand Surges On Binance As Price Nears $5,000 Institutional Demand and Market Positioning One of CryptoQuant’s contributors, known as Oinonen, highlighted how Ethereum is increasingly attracting institutional interest, signaling a change in the broader narrative. While Bitcoin has historically been viewed as the preferred digital asset for large investors, Ethereum’s use in decentralized finance (DeFi) and the recent inflows into spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are shifting perceptions. “Ethereum is now emerging as a challenger to Bitcoin’s institutional dominance,” Oinonen wrote. As an example, he pointed to Tom Lee’s Bitmine Immersion Technologies, which acquired $6 billion worth of ETH in just two months. This alone boosted Ethereum’s market capitalization from $300 billion to $557 billion. For context, MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, accumulated about $3 billion worth of Bitcoin over the same period, highlighting how significant ETH’s recent accumulation has become. This surge in institutional demand also aligns with Ethereum’s technical breakout. The price action suggests not only speculative buying but also structural changes in how the asset is being integrated into professional portfolios. With ETFs now approved and trading on national platforms in multiple regions, the shift is viewed as an important milestone for Ethereum’s role in global markets. Ethereum Short Squeeze and Volatility Outlook Another factor driving ETH’s price action is the unwinding of short positions on Binance. Oinonen noted that Ethereum has long been a favored asset for traders betting on declines. The unexpected breakout to new highs, however, triggered what he described as a “short squeeze,” forcing bearish traders to buy back ETH to cover their losses. This buying pressure amplified upward momentum and contributed to the rapid move toward $4,900. “The market is entering what could be called a ‘short squeeze season,’” the analyst explained, adding that Ethereum’s persistent rally may continue to pressure short sellers. While this scenario supports near-term gains, it also introduces the possibility of heightened volatility as positions are unwound. Looking ahead, Oinonen expects both Ethereum and Bitcoin to push toward further highs in the coming months, though he cautioned that a market correction could emerge between late 2025 and early 2026. The interplay between institutional demand, ETF inflows, and derivatives market dynamics is likely to define Ethereum’s trajectory during this period.

Cyber Capital founder Justin Bons argued that Bitcoin’s halving cycle could destabilize the blockchain within the next decade, setting off fears among investors already preparing for the next altcoin boom. Many in the market are now exploring emerging opportunities such as MAGACOIN FINANCE, which some see as a hedge against a possible deep Bitcoin correction. Bitcoin’s Shrinking Security Budget Bons highlighted that Bitcoin’s block rewards will drop to just 0.39 BTC per block by 2036. At today’s valuations, this equates to around $2.3 billion per year in miner incentives – a figure he claims is far too low to secure what could be a trillion-dollar network. Without sufficient funding, Bons warns that Bitcoin could become increasingly vulnerable to 51% attacks, where malicious actors gain control of the network to manipulate transactions. Governance Deadlock Raises Risks Another issue, according to Bons, is Bitcoin’s governance. Over the years, the Bitcoin Core development team has resisted major changes, including proposals for larger block sizes or inflation beyond the strict 21 million supply cap. While this rigidity has preserved Bitcoin’s scarcity narrative, Bons believes it could backfire. If future crises force changes, the risk of chain splits or inflationary measures could undermine trust in the system. Quantum Computing Looms Over Bitcoin The rise of quantum computing adds another layer of uncertainty. Bons noted that breakthroughs in the field could eventually crack Bitcoin’s cryptographic protections, especially in older wallets. Opinions differ on when this risk will become critical. Google’s Craig Gidney expects vulnerabilities between 2030 and 2035, while Blockstream’s Adam Back sees the threat as more than 20 years away. Others, including Naoris Protocol’s David Carvalho and investor Chamath Palihapitiya, caution that the danger could emerge in as little as five years, potentially affecting up to 30% of coins in circulation. Where Investors Are Looking Next While concerns over Bitcoin grow, many investors are eyeing new opportunities with higher returns potential . One project that has been gaining attention is MAGACOIN FINANCE, which analysts say offers a compelling alternative. With a fully audited system, expanding ecosystem, and massive early growth potential, some forecasts suggest early entries could see gains as high as 50x. For those anticipating a major altcoin cycle, this project is quickly becoming a favorite for forward-looking portfolios. Smart investors also position themselves early so that a potential Bitcoin correction could turn into a profitable situation. A Divided Future The warnings from Bons don’t signal an immediate collapse, but they highlight structural issues that could challenge Bitcoin’s dominance in the years ahead. With debates over security budgets, governance rigidity, and quantum computing risks intensifying, investors are left weighing whether Bitcoin can adapt or if altcoins will claim a larger share of the spotlight. For those preparing now, opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE show why diversification could be critical before the next wave of adoption .

The letter , citing authority under Article II of the Constitution and the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, declared her removal from the Board of Governors effective immediately. This is the first time in history that a sitting president has taken this step and comes as part of Trump’s renewed pressure campaign against the central bank. The White House said Trump’s decision came after allegations that Lisa, who was nominated by Joe Biden in 2022, committed mortgage fraud. The administration accuses her of claiming two properties as her primary residence within the same period. “There is sufficient reason to believe you have made false statements on one or more mortgage agreements,” Trump wrote in the letter. He pointed to the criminal referral sent to the Department of Justice and added: “You signed one document attesting that a property in Michigan would be your primary residence for the next year. Two weeks later, you signed another document for a property in Georgia stating that it would be your primary residence for the next year.” Pulte accused Cook, Trump demanded resignation The claims against Lisa began spreading on August 20 after Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, who has regularly criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, posted on social media accusing her of fraud. He followed up by sending a criminal complaint to the Justice Department, which Trump then referenced in his letter. Shortly after Pulte’s post went public, Trump called for Lisa Cook to resign, writing, “Cook must resign, now!!!” on Truth Social. Lisa responded with a firm denial and refused to leave her role. “I have no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet,” she said in a statement. Trump, not waiting for a court ruling or legal outcome, made good on his threat two days later. Speaking to reporters on August 22, he said, “What she did was bad.” The firing is now expected to trigger a legal showdown. The Federal Reserve Act says a president can only remove a governor “for cause,” but doesn’t specify what “cause” means. Traditionally, it’s interpreted to mean criminal misconduct or failure to perform duties. Legal experts told the New York Times that if a court lets Lisa continue working during the case, it could reach the Supreme Court. Trump moves to reshape Fed as Powell resists pressure If Trump wins the court fight, he’ll have another seat to fill on the Federal Reserve Board, giving him further power to reshape the institution. Lisa was the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor. Governors serve 14-year terms, meaning her removal opens up long-term influence. Two of the seven current board members, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, were appointed by Trump during his first term. He also made Jerome Powell the Fed’s chair in 2017. Earlier this year, Adriana Kugler stepped down suddenly, creating another opening. Trump has nominated Stephen Miran, head of the Council of Economic Advisors, to take that seat. With Lisa gone, Trump now has two nominations in play, further tightening his grip on the board. Trump has consistently attacked the central bank for refusing to slash interest rates faster. His complaints about Powell have gone on for years. Even though he installed Powell in the top job, Trump has publicly said he might fire him before his term ends next year. That threat hasn’t gone away. At the Jackson Hole symposium, Powell said that the Fed might cut rates if necessary. He added that the central bank would proceed “carefully” going forward. Trump’s moves continue to test the line between presidential authority and the Fed’s independence, pushing it into a space no one’s seen before. Get seen where it counts.

Here’s What It Says About Coming Price Rally,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-hourly-and-daily-liquidity-heres-what-it-says-about-coming-price-rally/,"Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk), a well-followed market analyst, recently shared XRP liquidity charts that suggest a significant price move may be approaching. According to the analyst, the digital asset is headed toward a new all-time high, and he expects it to catch many investors off guard. His review of both hourly and daily data provides insight into where liquidity is clustered and how XRP’s price may react. $XRP hourly and daily liquidity. The move towards $4.20+ is coming and it will catch people offside pic.twitter.com/ZFMcLmS8RX — Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk) August 24, 2025 Hourly Liquidity Analysis On the hourly chart, XRP is trading near $3.03 with visible clusters of liquidity positioned above and below current levels. The chart shows a dense build-up of volume around the $3.50 to $3.60 range, marking this zone as an area of short-term interest. These areas of liquidity indicate where orders are concentrated and where price could either face resistance or find support, depending on direction. The hourly structure also displays a sequence of lower highs since July, after the asset hit a new all-time high , alongside repeated retests of local liquidity pools. This suggests that traders have been actively positioning in the range, and a move outside of it could trigger rapid price action. If buying momentum strengthens, the path toward the higher-volume levels above $3.60 becomes more plausible. Daily Liquidity Structure The daily chart reinforces the short-term picture but places it within a broader trend. XRP has been consolidating around the $3 level, repeatedly testing a descending resistance line that has held since it experienced some turbulence in early August . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The liquidity heatmap highlights a heavy build-up extending from $3.60 to $4.20, where significant concentrations of orders are located. This indicates that if XRP breaks through the trendline and sustains momentum, the next target is the higher liquidity pocket in the $4.20 region. The chart also shows relatively lighter liquidity zones below $2.80, implying that downside moves may be less cushioned, though the current structure suggests attention is on the upside potential. The XRP $4.20 Target Cryptoinsightuk noted that “the move towards $4.20+ is coming and it will catch people offside,” emphasizing the likelihood of many traders being unprepared for a breakout of this magnitude. The charts support this view, with both hourly and daily readings pointing to liquidity positioned above current trading levels. A decisive shift in volume could therefore propel XRP swiftly toward the target, and potentially toward higher levels, as a recent analysis showed that there are no liquidity walls above $5 .

During a livestream on August 14, HTX DAO Core Builder @HTX_Molly presented the updates in the 18th session of the Official Interview Series, “The DAO Talks”. The event, titled “HTX DAO White Paper Upgrade: How an Institutional Experiment Evolved into a Realistic Path”, featured crypto influencers including Helium. Discussions centered on key revisions to the HTX DAO white paper, governance challenges, strategies to strengthen community participation, compliance considerations, and the long-term trajectory of the $HTX , as well as on-chain financial governance. Key Highlights of the White Paper Upgrade The new HTX DAO white paper represents more than just a textual update; it signals a strategic shift in direction, positioning HTX as a central player in on-chain financial governance rather than a traditional exchange. The vision is to build a user-driven “financial free port”, where every participant shares both governance power and profit rights. The revised paper translates earlier abstract concepts into actionable plans. It defines governance permissions with greater precision, outlines concrete use cases, and provides the community with a clear roadmap of the project’s practical direction. It also emphasizes that HTX DAO’s long-term vitality depends on a structured governance incentive system. User contributions—including voting, trading, staking, and content creation—are treated as governance actions rewarded with points, airdrops, and returns. At the same time, ecosystem partners such as HTX and TRON contribute through token burns, buybacks, and airdrops. This creates a positive cycle of “participate, earn, and re-participate,” continuously strengthening both user engagement and the DAO’s overall appeal. Building on this foundation, HTX DAO plans to expand governance into additional ecosystem modules such as Launchpad, Launchpool, and on-chain wealth management. It will also explore governance applications in new financial sectors, including Real World Assets (RWAs), Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs), stablecoins, and cross-chain bridges. Furthermore, it aims to empower on-chain partners by providing traffic and distribution resources. Over time, HTX DAO envisions itself evolving into a “financial sovereign harbor”, where global $HTX holders govern collectively and share in real on-chain value, dividends, and ownership. Molly emphasized that a white paper is a project’s core standard. It must reflect the team’s evolving vision, strategic adjustments, and practical roadmap, while also serving as an authoritative reference for users to understand development progress and direction. Crypto influencer Helium described HTX DAO as a maturing organization built on two key features: a “balance scale” governance tool and a modular operating model, which together define its framework. HTX Affiliate Jingyi added that the white paper reinforces a core principle: users are active participants rewarded for their engagement—an approach that has successfully boosted community involvement and initiative. Adhering to Longtermism During the livestream, Molly also discussed the development of HTX DAO’s voting-based crypto recommendation mechanism. She noted that the first step is to define the problem it seeks to solve and the tangible benefits it brings to users. The second is to design a rational incentive system that sustains long-term participation. She stressed that voting mechanisms, like long-term projects, experience cycles of enthusiasm and stagnation. The key is to adhere to longtermism, resolve issues as they arise, and maintain a developmental outlook on governance. Molly further explained that the goal of providing sustained user benefits is not to generate short-term hype through one or two events. Instead, it involves dedicating one to two years to refining the mechanism and building a successful governance system. In the next 6–12 months, the team will focus on three priorities: Validating the effectiveness of the voting-based recommendation mechanism. Establishing a treasury and points system to track and reward contributions. Granting developer permissions on the official site to build a truly member-driven DAO, with the points system as a key incentive. About HTX DAO As a multi-chain deployed decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), HTX DAO demonstrates an innovative governance approach. Unlike traditional corporate structures, it adopts a decentralized governance structure composed of a diversified group, jointly committed to the success of this organization. This unique ecosystem advocates openness and encourages all DAO participants to propose ideas that can promote the development of HTX DAO.

Recent reports have unveiled the impressive UAE Bitcoin holdings , positioning the nation among the top holders worldwide. This development signals a strategic move by the UAE into the digital asset space, capturing the attention of investors and analysts alike. What Are the UAE’s Massive Bitcoin Holdings? According to data reported by The Defiant, citing Arkham, an address officially confirmed to belong to the UAE government now holds a substantial 6,300 BTC. This impressive cache of Bitcoin is currently valued at approximately $740 million, marking the UAE as the fourth-largest national holder of Bitcoin globally. This discovery highlights the growing trend of sovereign nations recognizing and accumulating digital assets. What makes these UAE Bitcoin holdings particularly noteworthy is their origin. Unlike many institutional or national acquisitions that involve purchases on the open market, the UAE’s accumulation followed a different path. The nation acquired its Bitcoin through self-mining operations, showcasing a unique and proactive approach. How Were These Strategic UAE Bitcoin Holdings Acquired? The journey of these substantial UAE Bitcoin holdings traces back to Citadel Mining. This company is a key player in the acquisition process. Interestingly, the Royal Group, an influential investment firm closely associated with the Abu Dhabi royal family, holds a majority stake in Citadel Mining. This direct involvement from a sovereign-linked entity underscores the strategic importance placed on these digital assets. The fact that none of the 6,300 BTC was purchased on the open market is a critical detail. It suggests a proactive, long-term strategy rather than speculative trading. Self-mining allows for several key advantages: Direct Accumulation: Nations maintain control over the acquisition process from the ground up. Cost Efficiency: Potentially lower average acquisition costs compared to market purchases, especially during volatile periods. Strategic Independence: Reduced reliance on external exchanges or market liquidity for large-scale acquisitions. This method positions the UAE not just as a holder, but as an active participant in the Bitcoin network’s infrastructure. What Does This Mean for the UAE’s Crypto Future? The revelation of significant UAE Bitcoin holdings has profound implications for the nation’s future in the digital economy. The UAE has long expressed ambitions to become a global hub for innovation and technology, and its embrace of cryptocurrencies aligns perfectly with this vision. This move could: Boost Confidence: Signal a strong governmental endorsement of digital assets, encouraging further institutional and retail adoption within the region. Attract Investment: Position the UAE as a leader in blockchain and crypto innovation, drawing in more crypto businesses, talent, and foreign direct investment. Diversify Reserves: Offer a new avenue for diversifying national reserves, moving beyond traditional assets and into the burgeoning digital economy. Moreover, by engaging in self-mining, the UAE gains firsthand experience and expertise in the underlying technology of Bitcoin. This practical involvement can inform future regulatory frameworks and foster a more robust, crypto-friendly ecosystem within the country. How Do UAE Bitcoin Holdings Compare Globally? Ranking fourth globally for Bitcoin holdings is a remarkable achievement for the UAE. While specific details about other national holdings are often opaque, this position places the UAE alongside or even ahead of nations traditionally associated with significant crypto activity. This global standing enhances the UAE’s reputation as a forward-thinking nation willing to embrace disruptive technologies and lead in the digital transformation. The method of accumulation also differentiates the UAE significantly. Many nations or public companies that hold Bitcoin have acquired it through open market purchases or as part of legal seizures. The UAE’s approach through controlled self-mining operations highlights a unique and arguably more integrated strategy for building national digital asset reserves. This could set a powerful precedent for how other nations might consider their own crypto strategies in the future, especially concerning the strategic accumulation of assets. Why Did the UAE Choose Self-Mining for Its Bitcoin Holdings? Why did the UAE opt for self-mining to build its substantial UAE Bitcoin holdings ? The answer lies in control and a clear, long-term vision. Self-mining provides a degree of sovereignty over the asset acquisition process that market purchases simply cannot. It allows the nation to: Control Supply Chain: Influence the mining process and energy consumption directly, potentially aligning with sustainability goals. Ensure Security: Potentially manage security protocols for mining infrastructure more tightly, reducing external vulnerabilities. Foster Domestic Industry: Develop local expertise and infrastructure around blockchain technology and mining, creating jobs and innovation within the country. This strategic choice reflects a sophisticated understanding of the cryptocurrency ecosystem and a commitment to building a resilient digital future. It’s a testament to the UAE’s proactive stance in the evolving global financial landscape. The revelation of the UAE’s substantial UAE Bitcoin holdings is more than just a headline; it’s a testament to a nation actively shaping its economic future through digital innovation. By strategically accumulating Bitcoin through self-mining, the UAE is not only diversifying its assets but also solidifying its position as a global leader in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. This proactive approach sets a compelling example for other nations considering their own digital asset strategies, highlighting the potential for sovereign wealth funds and governments to integrate digital assets into their long-term economic plans. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are the UAE’s current Bitcoin holdings? The UAE government holds 6,300 BTC, valued at approximately $740 million, making it the fourth-largest national holder of Bitcoin globally. 2. How did the UAE acquire its Bitcoin?

Why is self-mining significant for national Bitcoin holdings? Self-mining offers direct control over acquisition, potential cost efficiency, strategic independence from open markets, and allows for the development of domestic expertise and infrastructure in blockchain technology. 4. What does this mean for the UAE’s role in the global crypto market? This move positions the UAE as a leading nation in digital asset adoption, boosts confidence in the crypto sector, attracts investment, and contributes to the diversification of national reserves, enhancing its reputation as a global innovation hub. 5. Were these UAE Bitcoin holdings purchased on the open market? No, none of the 6,300 BTC held by the UAE government was purchased on the open market.

A mysterious Bitcoin whale , identified by the address bc1qgf, recently made headlines with another substantial acquisition. This anonymous investor added a staggering 200 BTC to their wallet, a purchase valued at an impressive $22.4 million. This move, reported by Onchainlens and executed via FalconX, underscores the ongoing confidence some major players have in the leading cryptocurrency. Who is This Mysterious Bitcoin Whale and Why Does It Matter? This isn’t the first time this particular Bitcoin whale has made waves. The address bc1qgf began its accumulation journey back in July. Since then, it has steadily built up a colossal stash of digital assets. With this latest purchase, the whale’s total holdings now stand at an astonishing 2,419 BTC, boasting a market value of $265.9 million. Such large-scale movements by individual entities often spark considerable interest and speculation within the crypto community. Understanding the actions of large holders, often referred to as “whales,” is crucial for market observers. These entities possess enough capital to influence market dynamics. When a Bitcoin whale makes a move, it can signal a variety of things, offering valuable insights: Strong Conviction: Consistent accumulation often suggests a long-term bullish outlook from sophisticated investors. Market Confidence: Large, strategic purchases can instill confidence in other investors, potentially attracting more capital into the market. Potential Price Impact: While not always immediate, significant buying pressure from whales can contribute to upward price momentum over time. Supply Shock Indicators: As more BTC moves into cold storage or strong hands, the circulating supply available for trading decreases, which could lead to future price appreciation. Moreover, the sheer scale of this whale’s holdings means their future actions—whether buying more or eventually selling—could have noticeable effects on market sentiment and liquidity. Therefore, monitoring such addresses becomes a key strategy for many traders. What Drives Such Massive Bitcoin Whale Accumulation? The motivations behind a Bitcoin whale’s consistent accumulation are often multifaceted. While we can only speculate for anonymous entities, several factors typically drive such large-scale investments: Long-Term Value Belief: Many whales believe Bitcoin will continue to appreciate significantly over time. They often see current prices as opportune moments to increase their substantial holdings. Inflation Hedge: In an environment of economic uncertainty and rising inflation concerns, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a robust store of value, akin to digital gold. Its decentralized nature and fixed supply make it appealing. Portfolio Diversification: Large investors frequently diversify their portfolios across various asset classes. Bitcoin has proven its place as a legitimate, high-growth asset that can offer uncorrelated returns to traditional markets. Strategic Positioning: Some whales might be positioning themselves for anticipated market events, such as broader institutional adoption, favorable regulatory developments, or upcoming halving events. This specific whale’s continuous buying from July highlights a sustained, strategic approach rather than a one-off trade. It strongly suggests a calculated effort to build a significant position in the world’s premier digital asset, reflecting deep conviction in its future. How Can You Track Bitcoin Whale Activity Safely and Effectively? While this particular Bitcoin whale remains anonymous, the inherent transparency of blockchain technology allows anyone to observe these movements. On-chain analytics platforms, like Onchainlens mentioned in our report, provide invaluable data and tools. These resources enable users to: Monitor Large Transactions: Identify when significant amounts of BTC are moved between wallets or to/from exchanges. Track Wallet Balances: Observe how major wallets accumulate or distribute their holdings over time, revealing accumulation or distribution phases. Analyze Exchange Flows: See if whales are moving funds onto or off exchanges. Inflows often suggest potential selling pressure, while outflows can indicate accumulation or movement to cold storage. Utilize Whale Alerts: Many platforms offer real-time alerts for large transactions, keeping you informed as they happen. However, it’s crucial to approach such data with a critical eye and avoid making rash decisions. While whale movements can offer fascinating insights into market sentiment, they are not definitive predictors of future price action. The crypto market is influenced by a multitude of factors, and individual whale actions are just one piece of the complex puzzle. Always conduct your own research and consider a broad range of indicators. The latest acquisition by the bc1qgf address reaffirms the presence of highly confident, deep-pocketed investors in the Bitcoin ecosystem. This anonymous Bitcoin whale continues to be a fascinating subject for market watchers, embodying the long-term conviction that many hold for the future of digital currency. Their growing war chest serves as a powerful reminder of the substantial capital flowing into Bitcoin, shaping its trajectory in the global financial landscape. As the crypto market evolves, the actions of these major players will undoubtedly remain a key area of interest. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Bitcoin whale?

Recent reports indicate a dramatic surge in the total value of these assets, largely propelled by the booming cryptocurrency market. This trend highlights a growing engagement with digital finance among South Korean investors and signals a new era for financial reporting. What’s Driving the Phenomenal Surge in South Korea Overseas Crypto Assets? The latest data reveals a truly astonishing increase in overseas financial accounts reported to South Korean authorities. In 2025, the total value reached an impressive 94.5 trillion won, which is approximately $68.5 billion. This figure represents a substantial 45.6% increase compared to the previous year. Moreover, the number of individuals filing these reports also grew significantly, hitting an all-time high with a 38.3% rise. So, what exactly is fueling this remarkable growth? The National Tax Service (NTS) in South Korea has provided a clear explanation. The primary catalyst behind this surge is the substantial rise in virtual asset values. As cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced significant price appreciation, more individuals found themselves crossing the reporting threshold, prompting them to declare their holdings. This trend indicates a growing awareness and compliance within the crypto community. Let’s break down the key figures: Total Reported Value: 94.5 trillion won ($68.5 billion) Year-over-Year Increase: 45.6% Increase in Filers: 38.3% Virtual Assets Reported: 11.1 trillion won ($8.0 billion) Virtual assets, including various forms of cryptocurrency, now stand as the third-largest category of reported overseas financial assets, following only traditional stocks and bank deposits. This positioning underscores the significant role that South Korea overseas crypto assets now play in the nation’s financial landscape. The Impact of Rising Crypto Valuations on Reporting Compliance The significant increase in the value of virtual assets has had a direct impact on reporting compliance. Many investors, whose crypto holdings previously remained below the reporting threshold, now find themselves obligated to declare these assets to the NTS. This isn’t just about rising crypto prices; it’s also about a broader trend of increased awareness and enforcement regarding overseas financial holdings. The NTS actively monitors these trends to ensure tax compliance. Their explanation highlights that the surge isn’t solely due to crypto; there was also a notable increase in the value of reported stock accounts. However, the sheer volume and growth rate of virtual assets make them a dominant factor in this overall increase. This situation creates both opportunities and challenges for investors. For investors holding South Korea overseas crypto assets , understanding reporting requirements is crucial. The NTS’s proactive stance means that ignoring these obligations can lead to significant penalties. Therefore, staying informed about the latest regulations and accurately declaring all overseas financial holdings, including cryptocurrencies, is paramount for responsible investing. Navigating Overseas Financial Reporting: Key Insights for South Korean Investors For South Korean investors, particularly those with a diversified portfolio that includes virtual assets held abroad, this report serves as a vital reminder. The landscape of international finance is evolving rapidly, and digital assets are at its forefront. Keeping abreast of tax regulations and reporting requirements is no longer optional but a fundamental aspect of managing wealth. What should investors consider? Threshold Awareness: Be aware of the specific thresholds that trigger reporting obligations for overseas financial accounts, including crypto. Accurate Valuation: Ensure accurate valuation of virtual assets at the required reporting times, which can be complex given crypto market volatility. Professional Advice: Consider consulting with financial advisors or tax professionals specializing in international taxation and cryptocurrency to ensure full compliance. Documentation: Maintain meticulous records of all overseas transactions and holdings to facilitate accurate reporting. The remarkable growth in reported South Korea overseas crypto assets signifies a maturing market where digital currencies are increasingly integrated into mainstream financial reporting. This trend is likely to continue, prompting both authorities and investors to adapt to this dynamic environment. In conclusion, the substantial surge in reported overseas financial assets in South Korea, significantly driven by rising cryptocurrency values, paints a clear picture: digital assets are now a major component of national wealth and a critical area for financial oversight. This shift underscores the importance of transparency and compliance for all investors engaging with the global crypto market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why did overseas financial assets in South Korea surge so dramatically? A1: The primary reason for the 45.6% surge was the significant increase in virtual asset (cryptocurrency) values, which pushed more individuals over the reporting threshold, alongside a rise in reported stock account values. Q2: What are ‘virtual assets’ in this context? A2: Virtual assets refer to various forms of cryptocurrencies and other digital tokens, which are now a significant component of overseas financial holdings reported by South Koreans. Q3: How much did virtual assets contribute to the total reported value?

Q4: Who is responsible for reporting these overseas financial assets? A4: Individuals and entities in South Korea who hold overseas financial accounts, including virtual assets, that exceed a certain threshold are legally obligated to report them to the National Tax Service (NTS). Q5: What are the implications for South Korean crypto investors? A5: South Korean crypto investors must be diligent in tracking their overseas virtual asset holdings, understanding reporting thresholds, and ensuring timely and accurate declaration to avoid penalties and maintain compliance.

After enjoying a relatively strong weekend that kept sentiment leaning positive, selling pressure emerged on Monday, which pushed the price back down to $2.95. The correction phase may not be over yet, as on-chain data points to rising exchange inflows across multiple value bands, a pattern that is often linked to profit-taking behavior. XRP at Crossroads Historically, XRP’s major peaks, such as $3 in 2018, $1.9 in 2021, and $0.9 in 2023, were all preceded by significant spikes in exchange deposits. CryptoQuant explained that this means investors and whales sent tokens to trading platforms to realize gains. Entering 2025, XRP surged to the $3.5-$4 range, and inflows, particularly from large holders in the 100K-1M+ XRP range, reached exceptionally high levels. Such moves strongly imply that whales are beginning to offload holdings and introduce increased short-term selling pressure. Currently, the crypto asset is consolidating below $3, yet inflow levels remain high, thereby keeping downside risks in focus. Should the selling pressure intensify, a pullback toward the $2.8 support zone appears plausible. However, if the crypto asset is able to reclaim and hold $3 level, it could serve as a critical base for the next bullish advance. The key resistance area sits at $4.2-$4.5, and a successful breakout above that range could pave the way for a new price discovery phase. Structurally, the analysis revealed that XRP is stronger than during past cycles, and has maintained a firm long-term uptrend. Therefore, while the short-term outlook indicates caution, the broader trajectory still supports the possibility of XRP targeting $5 or higher later in 2025. These on-chain signals are consistent with Elliott Wave forecasts. Make-or-Break Level for XRP Elliott Wave analyst Avi Harkishun spoke about two key scenarios based on critical support levels. In his tweet, Harkishun noted that as long as the current $2.95 level holds firm, XRP retains a bullish structure. The next upside target is projected between $4.00 and $4.40. However, he also outlined a cautionary path – if $2.95 breaks decisively, XRP could enter a corrective phase through a WXY double correction pattern, and potentially retrace toward $2.40 at the high-volume node, an area of historically strong liquidity. In short, the altcoin’s next move will be determined by whether buyers can defend the $2.95 threshold or whether sellers force a breakdown. Other market commentators are also weighing in on XRP’s next move. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez, for one, struck a bullish tone, as he tweeted that “it won’t take long before the token is back at $3.70!” The post XRP Crashes Back Under $3: Deeper Correction or Bounce-Off Next? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|XRPBTC|XRPUSD|Ripple (XRP) Price,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-08-26 03:25:29

Bitcoin has plunged below $110,000, while Ethereum hovered at $4,430. Altcoins have suffered the most, with LINK, SOL, and DOGE losing up to 10% of their value in the past day. Meanwhile, Huma Finance appeared to suffer the most by losing over 14% within the previous 24 hours. HUMA price looks poised for further declines as the PayFi project prepares to release 377.92 coins, worth approximately $9.03 million, in the coming hours. Source – Tokenomist Huma braces for massive token unlock While token unlocks are common in the crypto space, they often trigger volatility as they add new supply into the circulating assets. While HUMA’s 377 release could be modest compared to its 1.73 billion supply in circulation, it’s enough to shake markets. Market players often expect bearish momentum from unlock events, which catalyzes price dips. The ‘sell the rumor’ narrative might be behind HUMA’s current substantial plunge. Investors and traders are likely eager to avoid more losses, especially as the broader market remains in the red. The prevailing sentiments suggest that Huma Finance will hardly absorb the increased supply. The event requires a surge in demand from ecosystem activity, governance participation, and staking to keep HUMA prices afloat during the upcoming $9.03 million token release. Thus, the altcoin may struggle to secure a reliable footing in the near term. What for HUMA traders? Indeed, Huma Finance’s short-term bias looks shaky. Nonetheless, various factors might shape the asset’s performance in the coming times. HUMA traders should watch for the immediate post-unlock performance. Price stability or intensified selling pressure could define the short-term trajectory. Also, Huma Finance’s trajectory will hinge on broader sentiments. Small caps would record notable bounce-backs if Bitcoin and Ethereum switch to uptrends. Prevailing sentiments suggest extended dips or consolidation before considerable recoveries. Large-scale investors have offloaded BTC worth around $6 billion in the previous week.

Nevertheless, this could be whales booking profits after Bitcoin’s latest run to all-time highs. Bitcoin should reclaim $112,000 to support rebounds to $120,000. Meanwhile, Huma Finance has positioned itself as a crypto project with real-world utility. It aims to democratize the global payment industry with instant liquidity access. The payment sector has seen green traction lately, especially after the US stablecoin regulation. Enthusiasts will watch how Huma Finance demonstrates its competitiveness in the PayFi space in the coming months and years. HUMA price outlook The native coin lost around 14% on its daily chart after dipping from an intraday high of $0.02663 to $0.02288. HUMA trades at $0.02414 after a brief jump from 24-hour lows. Chart by Coinmarketcap On-chain data and technical indicators suggest further declines for the digital coin. Huma Finance will likely plummet to new weekly lows amid the upcoming supply increase. Moreover, HUMA has shown weakness since its debut , currently down 80% from its launching peaks. However, sudden shifts in the broader market could trigger significant recoveries for Huma prices.

Many are seeking early-stage projects with strong fundamentals that can outperform established giants. Hidden gem presales are attracting attention not only for their upside potential but also for their ability to outpace even blue-chip tokens. Among the fresh names making waves, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the most talked-about projects, with analysts linking it to extraordinary ROI projections. 1. MAGACOIN FINANCE Steals the Spotlight The MAGACOIN FINANCE forecast is shaking up discussions across trading circles. Analysts are projecting a staggering 22,500% return, pushing it far ahead of traditional players. Touted as one of the best crypto presale events of 2025, expectations now suggest a possible 40x rise. The excitement is driven by strong community backing and capped availability, which has fueled urgency among those chasing early entry. In comparison to legacy coins, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being framed as the bold new contender—an option for those hunting presales with high ROI . 2. Cardano: Q4 Upgrades and Bullish Outlook The Cardano price outlook for 2025 has been steadily improving thanks to major ecosystem upgrades. Analysts remain optimistic: Digital Coin Price sees ADA climbing as high as $2.69 with an average of $2.46. CoinCodex pushes the ceiling even higher, projecting a $5.33 maximum target. Whale activity is also ramping up, with 200 million ADA bought in just 48 hours. Beyond speculation, Cardano is actively building. Hydra’s Layer-2 scaling reached one million transactions per second in tests, while Project Acropolis is cutting sync times by 40%. Cardano 1Y price chart With ETF approval odds surging past 80% on Polymarket, bullish bets are growing stronger. This makes Cardano one of the top crypto investments 2025 could deliver. 3. MATIC/POL: Bold Targets and Expanding Utility Polygon has undergone one of the most ambitious transitions in the space with its full migration to POL. The MATIC bullish prediction for 2025 paints an aggressive picture: Flitpay puts the top target at $6.25. TokenMetrics anticipates $3.91 by year-end. Participation in the migration has exceeded 85%, highlighting strong community support. Polygon’s AggLayer and Chain Development Kit are unlocking cross-chain liquidity, while 100 million POL are allocated yearly for project growth. With predictions spanning from $0.47 at the low end to multiple dollars in bullish scenarios, the MATIC bullish prediction narrative is hard to ignore. Like Cardano, Polygon is positioning itself among the top crypto investments 2025 watchers are tracking closely. Final Word: Which Hidden Gem Presales Stand Out? For those eyeing hidden gem presales, the field looks stacked with opportunities. Cardano and MATIC remain strong candidates thanks to robust development and institutional interest. However, the MAGACOIN FINANCE is the one turning heads with its bold 22,500% ROI projection. The limited entry slots and a fast-growing community narrative make it one of the presales with high ROI traders don’t want to overlook. In short, while ADA and MATIC are cementing their place as reliable long-term holds, MAGACOIN FINANCE steps in as the rising star tipped as the best crypto presale of 2025.

This staggering figure highlights the intense volatility inherent in cryptocurrency trading, catching many traders off guard. When such massive liquidations occur, it sends ripples across the entire digital asset landscape, affecting everyone from seasoned investors to new entrants. Understanding these sudden shifts is crucial for anyone navigating the fast-paced world of crypto. What Triggered These Massive Perpetual Futures Liquidations? In the past 24 hours, the cryptocurrency market witnessed a dramatic surge in perpetual futures liquidations . This wasn’t just a small blip; it was a substantial market correction that impacted major digital assets. Let’s break down the numbers to see where the biggest hits occurred: Bitcoin (BTC): A total of $262.97 million was liquidated. A staggering 82.87% of these were long positions, meaning traders betting on price increases faced significant losses. Ethereum (ETH): Even more impacted, ETH saw $322.33 million liquidated. Long positions accounted for an even higher 87.02% of these liquidations. Solana (SOL): SOL also faced considerable pressure, with $52.09 million liquidated. An overwhelming 94.8% of these were long positions, indicating a strong bearish sentiment for those holding leveraged bets. These figures reveal a clear trend: the vast majority of liquidated positions were ‘longs.’ This indicates a sudden market downturn caught many traders who were expecting prices to rise, leading to forced closures of their leveraged positions. Why Do Perpetual Futures Liquidations Occur So Rapidly? Many wonder why such large sums can vanish so quickly in the crypto space. The answer lies in the mechanics of perpetual futures liquidations and the use of leverage. Perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of a cryptocurrency without actually owning the underlying asset. They differ from traditional futures because they don’t have an expiry date, hence ‘perpetual’. However, the real accelerator for liquidations is leverage . Leverage enables traders to control a large position with a relatively small amount of capital. While this can amplify gains, it also dramatically magnifies losses. If the market moves against a highly leveraged position, the trader’s margin (collateral) can fall below a certain threshold. When this happens, the exchange automatically closes the position to prevent further losses, a process known as liquidation. This protects the exchange and the wider market, but it means significant losses for the individual trader. Who Gets Hit Hardest by These Market Shifts? The recent wave of perpetual futures liquidations primarily impacted traders holding ‘long’ positions. These are individuals who used leverage to bet that the price of Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Solana would increase. When prices instead took a sharp dive, their collateral was no longer sufficient to maintain their positions. Consequently, their positions were automatically closed, resulting in substantial financial losses. Understanding the dynamics of these liquidations is vital for risk management. Traders who use high leverage face immense risk. Even small price movements can lead to large losses or even total liquidation of their capital. This event serves as a stark reminder of the unpredictable nature of cryptocurrency markets and the critical need for prudent risk assessment. Navigating Volatility: Actionable Insights for Perpetual Futures Trading Given the recent volatility and significant perpetual futures liquidations , how can traders better protect themselves? Effective risk management is paramount. Here are some actionable insights: Manage Leverage Wisely: Avoid excessively high leverage. While tempting for bigger gains, it dramatically increases your liquidation risk. Set Stop-Loss Orders: Always use stop-loss orders to automatically close your position if the price moves against you beyond a predetermined point. This limits potential losses. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your capital into a single highly leveraged trade. Spread your risk across different assets or trading strategies. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, technical analysis, and global economic factors that can influence crypto prices. Understand Margin Requirements: Always be aware of your margin levels and the price at which your position would be liquidated. These strategies can help traders mitigate the risks associated with highly volatile markets and the sudden impact of liquidations. The staggering $637 million in perpetual futures liquidations over 24 hours serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent risks and rewards in crypto trading. This event underscores the importance of caution, education, and robust risk management strategies, especially when dealing with leveraged products like perpetual futures. While the potential for profit is alluring, the potential for rapid losses is equally real. Traders must approach these markets with respect for their volatility and a clear understanding of the tools they are using. Stay informed, stay cautious, and trade responsibly. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are perpetual futures? A1: Perpetual futures are cryptocurrency derivative contracts that allow traders to speculate on the future price of an asset without an expiry date, unlike traditional futures. Q2: What does ‘liquidation’ mean in crypto trading? A2: Liquidation occurs when an exchange automatically closes a trader’s leveraged position because their margin (collateral) has fallen below a required threshold, preventing further losses for the exchange. Q3: Why were mostly ‘long’ positions liquidated in this event? A3: ‘Long’ positions are bets that an asset’s price will increase. When the market experienced a sharp downturn, traders holding these leveraged long positions faced significant losses, leading to their liquidation. Q4: How can traders avoid perpetual futures liquidations? A4: Traders can mitigate risk by using lower leverage, setting stop-loss orders, diversifying their portfolio, staying informed about market conditions, and understanding their margin requirements. Q5: Does this event affect spot crypto prices? A5: While liquidations primarily impact derivatives markets, large-scale liquidations can sometimes trigger cascading sell-offs, indirectly influencing spot market prices due to increased selling pressure and negative sentiment.

The letter, sent last Friday, warned that these products “mimic” equities without offering shareholder rights or market trading safeguards. Tokenized equities represent ownership in a company or asset through digital tokens on a blockchain. However, investors do not become shareholders in the company. “We are alarmed at the plethora of brokers and crypto-trading platforms offering or intending to offer so-called tokenised U.S. stocks,” the WFE wrote to regulators. The coalition stressed that these products are not equivalent to stock tokens as they are marketed. Regulators to Apply Securities Rules on Tokenized Stocks: WFE Furthermore, the UK-based stock exchange association has urged the US SEC, ESMA, and the global securities watchdog IOSCO’s Fintech Task Force to apply securities rules to tokenised assets. Regulators should also clarify legal frameworks for ownership and custody of these products and prevent them from being marketed as stock equivalents, it added. WFE warned that such stock issuers could suffer “reputational damage” in case if the tokens fail. The group did not mention which brokers and trading platforms it was referring to. In June, investment platform Robinhood launched tokenized US stocks and ETFs , following a strong revenue growth and profitability. Other major players in the industry have also made similar leaps. Centralized exchanges such as Kraken are also offering tokenized U.S.-listed stock trading, while Coinbase intends to tokenize its own $COIN shares. Tokenized Stocks Remain Securities – SEC In July, Hester Peirce, a Republican commissioner on the SEC, often referred to as “crypto mom,” said that any new models for trading securities known as “tokenization” still meet the securities regulations . “As powerful as blockchain technology is, it does not have magical abilities to transform the nature of the underlying asset,” she said at the time. “Tokenized securities are still securities.” With the market for tokenized equities experiencing rapid expansion, there is a clear shift in how traditional assets are perceived and utilized within the digital economy. CoinGecko revealed that the tokenized equities sector of Real World Assets (RWAs) had grown by nearly 300% – an increase of over $8.6 million since the start of 2024 alone. “Despite this impressive growth and increasing institutional engagement, simply tokenizing an equity — in itself – offers little inherent value beyond a digital representation,” said Kevin Rusher , Co-founder of RAAC.

After four years of dormancy, a colossal sum of 6,334 ETH, valued at an astounding $28.08 million, was moved from the Kraken exchange. This isn’t just a large transaction; it’s a potential signal from one of the market’s quiet giants, often interpreted as a bullish move for Ethereum. What Just Happened: A Dormant ETH Whale Awakens? Imagine a sleeping giant in the crypto ocean. That’s essentially what occurred when a long-dormant address suddenly became active. Lookonchain, a prominent blockchain analytics firm, reported this significant ETH whale withdrawal approximately 50 minutes before the news broke. This particular whale had kept its substantial Ethereum holdings on Kraken for an extended period, making its recent move especially noteworthy. Such prolonged dormancy followed by a large withdrawal is a rare event, prompting market observers to pay close attention. Key Details of the Withdrawal: Asset: 6,334 ETH Approximate Value: $28.08 million at the time of withdrawal Origin: Kraken cryptocurrency exchange Previous State: Dormant for four years Typically, investors withdraw assets from exchanges when they intend to hold them for the long term, moving them to personal wallets for greater security and control. This action suggests a strategic decision by the whale, rather than an immediate intention to sell. Moving such a large sum off an exchange reduces the immediate selling pressure on the market, as these tokens are no longer sitting in an easily accessible trading account. Why Does an ETH Whale Withdrawal Matter to the Market? The movements of large holders, often called “whales,” can send significant ripples through the entire cryptocurrency market. When such a substantial amount of Ethereum leaves an exchange, it usually indicates a shift in sentiment among these influential players. Instead of being readily available for sale on an exchange, these tokens are now likely earmarked for cold storage, participation in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, or even preparation for future staking rewards. This specific ETH whale withdrawal event is particularly impactful due to the sheer volume and the whale’s previous inactivity. Potential Market Interpretations: Long-Term Conviction: The whale demonstrates strong belief in ETH’s long-term value appreciation, choosing to secure their assets rather than trade them. Enhanced Security: Moving assets off-exchange significantly reduces counterparty risk, protecting holdings from potential exchange hacks or regulatory issues. DeFi Engagement: The ETH might be destined for high-yield staking opportunities, lending platforms, or other DeFi activities, further removing it from the liquid trading supply. Reduced Selling Pressure: With millions of dollars worth of ETH moved off an exchange, the immediate supply available for sale decreases, which can be a bullish signal. This particular ETH whale withdrawal signals a potential decrease in selling pressure from this specific holder, which could be seen as a positive indicator for Ethereum’s price stability and potential future growth. It suggests that at least one major player sees more value in holding rather than selling at current prices. What Does This ETH Whale Withdrawal Mean for You as an Investor? While one whale’s actions don’t dictate the entire market, they offer valuable insights into broader trends and the psychology of large investors. This event highlights the ongoing confidence some significant investors have in Ethereum’s future ecosystem and its potential for continued innovation. For individual investors, understanding such movements can help contextualize overall market sentiment and provide a piece of the puzzle in their own investment decisions. It serves as a powerful reminder that major players are still actively engaging with and securing their digital assets, often with a long-term perspective. Actionable Insights for Investors: Observe Whale Trends: Keep a close eye on similar large movements. Significant withdrawals can often precede periods of price appreciation, while large deposits can signal potential selling. Research Underlying Motives: Understand the difference between exchange withdrawals (often bullish for long-term holding) and deposits (often bearish, indicating potential selling). Consider Security: This whale’s move underscores the importance of self-custody for large amounts of crypto. Explore hardware wallets for enhanced security. Diversify Your Portfolio: Never put all your eggs in one basket, regardless of whale movements. A diversified portfolio mitigates risks. This event underscores the dynamic nature of the crypto market, where every significant transaction, especially an ETH whale withdrawal of this magnitude, can spark discussion and analysis, influencing how many perceive the asset’s trajectory. Conclusion: The Strategic Silence of the ETH Whale The recent ETH whale withdrawal from Kraken, after four years of profound inactivity, is a compelling narrative within the crypto space. It exemplifies the strategic, long-term vision many large holders maintain for their digital assets. While the exact motives of this particular whale remain private, their actions strongly suggest a renewed commitment to holding Ethereum, potentially signaling a bullish outlook for the asset’s future. This event serves as a fascinating glimpse into the often-opaque world of crypto whales and their profound influence on market sentiment and supply dynamics, reminding us that even the quietest giants can make the biggest waves. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is an ETH whale withdrawal? An ETH whale withdrawal refers to a large amount of Ethereum (ETH) being moved from a cryptocurrency exchange by a single, significant holder (a “whale”) to a private wallet. This action is often interpreted as a sign of an intention to hold the asset for the long term rather than sell it immediately. 2. Why is a four-year dormant whale suddenly moving ETH significant? A whale becoming active after four years of dormancy is significant because it suggests a deliberate, strategic decision. Such a long period of inactivity followed by a major move indicates the whale has a renewed plan for their assets, likely related to long-term holding, staking, or participation in DeFi, rather than a quick trade. 3. Does this ETH whale withdrawal mean Ethereum’s price will go up? While a large withdrawal from an exchange typically reduces the immediate selling pressure and can be seen as a bullish signal, it does not guarantee a price increase. It’s one factor among many that influence market sentiment and supply dynamics. The whale’s individual action is not the sole determinant of market direction. 4. What is Kraken, and why is its involvement important? Kraken is one of the oldest and largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. Its involvement is important because large withdrawals from major exchanges are trackable and often signal significant shifts in investor behavior, impacting the overall market’s perceived liquidity and sentiment. 5. How can I track whale movements like this ETH whale withdrawal? You can track whale movements using blockchain analytics platforms like Lookonchain (mentioned in the article), Whale Alert, or Nansen. These tools monitor large transactions on various blockchains and report significant movements, helping investors understand potential market shifts. 6. Should I copy the whale’s actions and withdraw my ETH? While understanding whale movements provides insight, it’s crucial to make investment decisions based on your own research, financial goals, and risk tolerance. Copying a whale’s actions without understanding their full strategy or your own circumstances can be risky. Always consider self-custody for security, but do so thoughtfully.

Its viral momentum made headlines, yet the market is already showing signs of whale repositioning as investors weigh long-term potential. Many early backers are beginning to explore emerging opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which has been breaking record after record and positioning itself as a serious altcoin contender ahead of the next bull season. The Rise and Challenges of PEPE PEPE’s appeal comes from its cultural dominance as a meme token, much like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu before it. However, unlike those earlier projects, PEPE lacks deep utility at this stage, making its valuation heavily reliant on speculation and community strength. While this model has proven effective in the short term, sustainability remains the biggest question as the market matures. The past year has seen increased volatility in the meme coin sector, with PEPE dropping sharply after major rallies. At the same time, on-chain data shows that whales continue to accumulate during corrections, suggesting that big players see long-term potential despite the risks. This New Crypto Steals the Spotlight As PEPE navigates this uncertain path, MAGACOIN FINANCE has become a magnet for investor attention. Its audited tokenomics, strong security measures, and explosive community growth are setting it apart from typical meme-driven plays. Early participants have already witnessed a staggering 7,800% ROI , and analysts project even greater upside as the project pushes toward wider exchange listings. With whales quietly reallocating from PEPE into MAGACOIN FINANCE, the signs point to a possible repeat of early Shiba Inu-style growth, but with stronger fundamentals driving the surge. PEPE Price Prediction: 2025–2030 Looking ahead, PEPE’s price trajectory will likely depend on whether it can evolve beyond its meme roots. Here’s a speculative outlook based on current market dynamics: 2025: If altcoin season kicks off with strong momentum, PEPE could revisit its previous all-time high and climb toward $0.0000050. 2026–2027 : With community strength intact but limited utility, PEPE may consolidate between $0.0000020 and $0.0000035, driven mostly by trading cycles. 2028: Should the meme coin narrative reignite, another surge could push PEPE above $0.0000060, especially if new partnerships or utility are introduced. 2029–2030: Long-term sustainability is uncertain. Without added use cases, PEPE risks falling back under $0.0000015, but if it manages to integrate DeFi or NFT applications, it could stabilize near $0.0000040. Conclusion PEPE has shown it can capture attention faster than almost any coin on the market, but questions around long-term sustainability remain. For those chasing big potential gains, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s record-breaking growth and massive ROI projections are setting it apart as one of the top altcoin opportunities before the next major rally.

New Solana Treasury In The Makings The capital raise, which is set to close on August 28, will effectively transform Sharps’ stock into a proxy for the Solana price, attracting backing from crypto investment firms such as ParaFi, Pantera Capital, and CoinFund. This infusion of over $400 million positions Sharps to potentially become the largest holder of Solana among publicly traded companies, surpassing its nearest competitor, Upexi, which holds approximately $394 million in the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Analyst Says It Doesn’t Matter What Analysis You Use, XRP Price Is Set To Explode To further strengthen its position in the crypto ecosystem, Sharps has appointed Alice Zhang, a venture capitalist and co-founder of the crypto smartphone maker Jambo, to its board as the new chief investment officer. James Zhang, another co-founder from Jambo, will serve as a strategic advisor. Alice Zhang expressed confidence in the new team’s capabilities, stating, “We will have a team with deep ties to the Solana ecosystem and proven founder-level experience in scaling institutional digital asset platforms.” However, Sharps’ frontrunner status in the Solana treasury market may be short-lived. Fortune reports that major crypto players, including Galaxy Digital, Multicoin Capital, and Jump Crypto, are in the process of raising $1 billion to launch their own Solana treasury company. Strategy Expands Bitcoin Holdings This investment into Sharps is part of a larger trend where small public companies are actively establishing digital asset treasuries, which are essentially pools of cryptocurrency held on their balance sheets. This trend extends to the market’s largest altcoins, including XRP, Binance Coin (BNB), and The Open Network’s (TON) native token. This strategy has taken even higher relevance under the US’s leadership in creating a supportive framework for digital assets in the country.

Michael Saylor, the driving force behind Strategy’s crypto investments, revealed that the firm has achieved a Bitcoin yield of 25.4% year-to-date as of August 24, 2025. With 632,457 Bitcoins acquired for roughly $46.50 billion. As of this writing, Solana lost the $200 level in line with the broader market correction that led the cryptocurrency to retrace nearly 5% in the 24-hour time frame. It now trades at $196, meaning a 32% gap from its $293 record high.

With analysts spotlighting familiar names like XRP and Stellar, one surprising entry is MAGACOIN FINANCE. Tipped for a massive surge, this rising player is drawing early attention as traders weigh where the next wave of top presale coins will come from. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Rising Force in the 2025 Cycle MAGACOIN FINANCE is making headlines as analysts forecast it could deliver up to a 20,000% ROI. While established tokens dominate conversations around the best crypto presales, MAGACOIN is breaking through as a new contender. Early allocations are already gaining traction, with forecasts placing it among the top presale coins of the year. Unlike legacy tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE thrives on fresh momentum, with projections that it may rival or even surpass older networks in growth rate. For investors searching the best crypto presale to buy now, this project offers a blend of hype and upside potential rarely seen in the cycle. XRP Price Prediction: Eyes on ETF Approval When it comes to legacy tokens in the best crypto discussion, XRP continues to stand tall. Analysts frame its price trajectory in 2025 around ETF approval and regulatory clarity. Projections place XRP between $3 and $5 by late 2025, with bullish scenarios aiming for $5.50 if flows and institutional adoption expand. This XRP price prediction shows how one regulatory move could reshape the market. With the SEC delaying spot XRP ETF filings to October 2025, traders are watching closely. For anyone tracking the best altcoins to buy now, XRP’s position as a long-term utility coin is hard to ignore. Stellar Crypto Forecast: Network Upgrades Fueling Momentum Stellar’s growth path in 2025 looks increasingly tied to its network upgrades. Analysts set bullish targets of up to $1.29 for XLM, while more conservative forecasts outline a band between $0.48 and $0.75. Both ranges highlight strong upside if adoption continues. A big part of the Stellar crypto forecast revolves around the Protocol 23 upgrade set for validator vote in August 2025. The upgrade will add parallel execution for Soroban smart contracts, unified events, and better cost structures. These technical moves are expected to lift Stellar’s throughput and long-term adoption. Within the discussion of top presale coins, Stellar continues to hold its place thanks to both utility and development consistency. Final Thoughts: 3 Coins to Watch in 2025 The race for the best crypto presales 2025 comes down to a mix of legacy giants and rising contenders. XRP has its ETF-driven upside, Stellar shows strength through technical growth, and MAGACOIN FINANCE adds fresh fuel with a forecasted 20,000% ROI. For investors scanning top presale coins, the blend of established credibility and new explosive potential makes this group stand out. MAGACOIN FINANCE, while newer, is quickly becoming one of the most discussed names in crypto circles, showing why many view it as one of the best altcoins to buy now.

Strategy Has Made A Fresh Addition To Its Bitcoin Treasury As announced by Strategy chairman Michael Saylor in a new post on X, the company has completed a new Bitcoin acquisition involving 3,018 BTC. The firm purchased these coins for $356.9 million or an average price of $115,829 per token. According to the filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the purchase occurred between August 18th and 24th. This is the same window in which BTC faced a drawdown. Thus, it seems the company wasn’t dissuaded by the bearish price action. In fact, the firm’s purchase this week was significantly bigger than last week’s buy, which involved an amount of 430 BTC ($51.4 million), or the one from the week before, coming at 155 BTC. Following the latest acquisition, Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings have grown to 632,457 BTC. At the current exchange rate, this converts to almost $71.1 billion, which is nearly 53% above the company’s cost basis of $46.5 billion. The profit-loss balance of the Bitcoin holdings isn’t the only thing the firm is doing well on. As Saylor shared in an X post , Strategy has shown an impressive stock performance as well. “Five years ago, $MSTR adopted the Bitcoin Standard. Since then, we’ve outperformed every asset class and every Magnificent 7 stock,” explains the Strategy chairman. The success of Saylor’s firm started a trend of other companies also adopting a BTC treasury strategy. An example of this is Japan’s Metaplanet . Led by president Simon Gerovich, the firm has consistently been buying BTC much like Strategy. On Sunday, Gerovich unveiled a fresh purchase of 103 BTC ($11.7 million), which took the company’s reserve to 18,991 BTC (acquired for a total of $1.95 billion). The treasury strategy wave has now expanded into the altcoins, with SharpLink being a prominent example. The firm’s Ethereum holdings currently sit at 740,760 ETH. Now, news has come out that Galaxy Digital, Jump Crypto, and Multicoin Capital are planning a $1 billion Solana accumulation spree for a SOL treasury. In some other news, the CryptoQuant Bull Score Index is currently flagging the market as entering a bearish phase, as explained in an X post by Julio Moreno, CryptoQuant’s head of research. The Bull Score Index combines different on-chain metrics to determine what part of the cycle Bitcoin is in right now. As displayed in the above chart, the Bitcoin indicator has gone down recently. “The Bull Score Index is now at 40 and switched to the ‘Getting Bearish’ phase,” notes Moreno. BTC Price Bitcoin’s bearish form has continued during the past day as its price has dropped to the $110,900 level.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Buy|btc|BTCUSDT|michael saylor|Strategy|Strategy Bitcoin,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING|REGULATION|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-26 04:00:18

The price is now trading below $2.950 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a rising channel with support at $3.00 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to down if it stays below the $3.00 zone. XRP Price Dips Again XRP price attempted more gains above the $3.050 zone but struggled, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price topped near the $3.120 level and recently started a downside correction. There was a move below the $3.050 and $3.00 levels. The price dipped below the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.781 swing low to the $3.126 high. Besides, there was a break below a rising channel with support at $3.00 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. Finally, the price tested the $2.820 zone. A low was formed at $2.8244 and the price is now consolidating losses. The price is now trading below $2.950 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.90 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.980 level.

A clear move above the $2.980 resistance might send the price toward the $3.050 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $3.120 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $3.20. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.980 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.8250 level. The next major support is near the $2.780 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.780 level, the price might continue to decline toward $2.720. The next major support sits near the $2.650 zone, below which the price could gain bearish momentum. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone.

This shift marks a pivotal moment for the digital asset market, ending a streak of outflows that had concerned many. The End of an Outflow Streak for Spot Bitcoin ETFs On August 25, U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively saw a significant net inflow of $220 million. This impressive figure put an end to a seven-day stretch of net outflows, according to reliable data from Farside Investors. This turnaround is more than just a number; it represents a positive shift in market sentiment towards Bitcoin-backed investment products. For investors, this development is crucial. Prolonged outflows can indicate waning interest or uncertainty, whereas a strong inflow suggests a resurgence of belief in the asset class. The quick reversal highlights the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market and the increasing importance of these regulated investment vehicles. Who is Driving the Momentum in Spot Bitcoin ETFs? Several key players were instrumental in leading this wave of positive inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs . Their performance underscores the growing competition and interest within the regulated crypto investment space. Fidelity’s FBTC led the charge, attracting a notable $65.6 million in net inflows. Fidelity has consistently been a strong contender in the ETF market, and its performance here reinforces its position. BlackRock’s IBIT followed closely, securing $63.4 million in net inflows. BlackRock, a financial titan, brings immense credibility and institutional appeal to the Bitcoin market through its ETF offerings. Ark Invest’s ARKB also demonstrated strong performance, with inflows reaching $61.2 million. Ark Invest, known for its focus on disruptive innovation, continues to attract investors keen on future-forward assets. These figures demonstrate that institutional and retail investors alike are actively engaging with these products, choosing established fund managers to gain exposure to Bitcoin. Understanding the Impact of Spot Bitcoin ETFs Inflows What do these substantial inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs truly signify for the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem? Essentially, they represent a growing comfort level among traditional investors with Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Benefits of these inflows include: Enhanced Legitimacy: Consistent inflows from major funds like BlackRock and Fidelity lend significant credibility to Bitcoin in the eyes of mainstream finance. Increased Liquidity: More capital flowing into these ETFs can contribute to greater liquidity in the underlying Bitcoin market. Easier Access: Spot Bitcoin ETFs provide a straightforward and regulated way for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly managing cryptocurrencies. This simplifies the investment process considerably. Moreover, this positive momentum could encourage other institutional players to explore similar offerings, potentially broadening the market even further. The end of the outflow streak sends a clear signal that the appetite for regulated Bitcoin exposure remains robust. Navigating the Future of Spot Bitcoin ETFs and Digital Assets While the recent inflows are certainly a cause for optimism, it is important to consider the broader landscape for Spot Bitcoin ETFs and digital assets. The market remains subject to various factors, including regulatory changes, macroeconomic conditions, and overall investor sentiment. Challenges to consider: Market Volatility: Bitcoin, by nature, is a volatile asset. While ETFs offer exposure, they do not eliminate this inherent risk. Regulatory Scrutiny: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies and related products is still evolving, which can introduce uncertainties. Despite these challenges, the consistent interest in Spot Bitcoin ETFs suggests a maturing market. Investors are increasingly sophisticated in their approach, looking for regulated and accessible avenues to participate in the digital asset space. Monitoring these trends provides actionable insights for anyone interested in the future of finance. The recent $220 million net inflow into U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs marks a significant turning point, effectively ending a period of outflows and reigniting positive sentiment. Led by major players like Fidelity, BlackRock, and Ark Invest, this surge underscores the growing institutional confidence and accessibility that these products offer. This development not only bolsters Bitcoin’s legitimacy but also paves the way for a potentially more stable and integrated future for digital assets within traditional finance. It’s a clear signal that the market is ready to move forward. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Spot Bitcoin ETF? A Spot Bitcoin ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) is an investment vehicle that holds actual Bitcoin and tracks its price. It allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without directly owning or storing the cryptocurrency themselves. Why are inflows important for Spot Bitcoin ETFs? Inflows indicate that more money is being invested into these funds than is being withdrawn. This suggests strong investor confidence, increased demand for Bitcoin exposure, and can contribute to market liquidity and price stability for the underlying asset. Which funds led the recent inflows? The recent $220 million net inflow was primarily led by Fidelity’s FBTC, which attracted $65.6 million, followed by BlackRock’s IBIT with $63.4 million, and Ark Invest’s ARKB with $61.2 million. What does this mean for Bitcoin’s price? While not a direct predictor, sustained inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs can create buying pressure on the underlying Bitcoin market, as fund managers often purchase Bitcoin to back new shares. This can contribute to positive price momentum and stability. Are there any risks associated with Spot Bitcoin ETFs? Yes, like any investment, Spot Bitcoin ETFs carry risks. These include the inherent volatility of Bitcoin’s price, regulatory changes in the cryptocurrency market, and potential market manipulation, although the ETF structure aims to mitigate some of these risks.

Bitcoin briefly dipped below $109,214 on Tuesday after a single entity offloaded 24,000 BTC worth $2.7b . The sale triggered a rapid $4,000 slide, according to on-chain data. Despite the sale, the whale still controls more than 152,000 BTC valued at over $17b. Ethereum, which had set a new all-time high near $5,000 at the start of the week, also came under pressure. The second-largest cryptocurrency fell back to trade around $4,405 on Tuesday, down from weekend peaks, although it remains one of the strongest performers in recent weeks. $BTC under $110,000. pic.twitter.com/qUaWj4PL1C — CoinGecko (@coingecko) August 25, 2025 Crypto Market Cap Slips To $3.85 Trillion After Sharp Sell-Off In Majors CoinGlass data showed $941.8m in leveraged positions were liquidated over the past 24 hours. Ethereum accounted for $321.6m of those losses, while Bitcoin saw $261.6m liquidated. Altcoins were not spared, with Solana dropping 11.6% to $197 and XRP falling 5.3% to $2.88. The market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies slipped 4.5% to $3.85 trillion, reversing part of the rally that followed Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s comments at Jackson Hole last week. At the annual policy symposium, Powell signaled the Fed could move toward cutting interest rates as soon as September, citing risks from a weakening labor market and persistent inflation. His dovish remarks had fueled a surge in risk assets, with Bitcoin and Ether initially leading gains. Analysts Say Ethereum Could Lead Next Phase Of Crypto Rally Despite Macro Risks However, uncertainty around tariffs and political pressures has clouded the outlook. As a result, some economists expect the Fed to cut rates in September. Meanwhile, most believe the central bank will wait for additional data from upcoming jobs and inflation reports. Market analysts say the divided outlook has fueled volatility. In response, Gracy Chen, CEO at Bitget, noted that Bitcoin is likely to trade in the $110,000 to $120,000 range over the next two weeks. At the same time, she said Ethereum looks stronger, with targets between $4,600 and $5,200. “On-chain data shows capital rotation underway, with whales selling Bitcoin to increase Ethereum exposure, further accelerating ETH’s momentum,” Chen said. “This macro easing, combined with sustained ETF inflows and Ethereum’s growing utility, suggests ETH is positioned to outperform in the near term.” Bitcoin remains supported by institutional demand, analysts say, but Ethereum’s fundamentals, regulatory clarity, and ETF prospects could allow it to lead the next phase of the crypto rally.

According to Farside Investors, this impressive figure of $440 million (equivalent to 618.2 billion Korean Won) underscores a sustained interest in Ethereum exchange-traded funds. It’s not just a one-off event; these consistent inflows point to a deeper trend in institutional adoption and investor appetite for regulated crypto exposure. We are seeing a clear shift in how traditional finance approaches digital assets. Several key players led the charge in these inflows. BlackRock’s ETHA fund saw a substantial $315 million, demonstrating its strong market presence.

These figures highlight a broad-based positive sentiment across major issuers, showcasing robust demand for Spot ETH ETFs . Why Are Investors Pouring Capital into Spot ETH ETFs?

Investors are increasingly seeking regulated avenues to gain exposure to Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The perceived security and ease of access offered by ETFs make them an attractive option compared to direct crypto purchases, simplifying the investment process for many. Moreover, the growing utility of the Ethereum blockchain, from decentralized finance (DeFi) to NFTs and enterprise solutions, enhances its appeal. As the ecosystem matures, more traditional investors recognize Ethereum’s long-term potential. Regulatory clarity, albeit gradual, also plays a crucial role in boosting institutional confidence, paving the way for more mainstream adoption. Increased Accessibility: ETFs simplify investment in Ethereum for traditional portfolios, removing complexities. Institutional Confidence: Major financial institutions are actively participating, lending credibility to the asset class. Ethereum’s Ecosystem Growth: Expanding use cases and technological advancements drive fundamental value. Regulatory Progress: A clearer regulatory landscape reduces investment risk and fosters trust. What Do These Spot ETH ETF Inflows Mean for the Broader Market? These substantial inflows into Spot ETH ETFs are more than just numbers; they send a powerful signal to the entire cryptocurrency market. They suggest a growing acceptance of digital assets within mainstream finance.

This could accelerate the integration of cryptocurrencies into traditional investment portfolios globally, transforming the investment landscape. Looking Ahead: The Future of Spot ETH ETFs The consistent positive inflows are a strong indicator of sustained interest in Spot ETH ETFs . While market sentiment can always shift, the current trajectory suggests a promising future for these investment vehicles. Investors should, however, remain mindful of market volatility and conduct their own research, as with any investment, to make informed decisions. The long-term implications for Ethereum are significant. As more capital is locked into ETFs, it could further strengthen Ethereum’s position as a foundational asset in the digital economy. This institutional embrace is a testament to Ethereum’s enduring innovation and its potential to reshape various industries, from finance to entertainment. In conclusion, the recent $440 million net inflows into Spot ETH ETFs over three consecutive days are a powerful testament to the growing institutional and retail interest in Ethereum.

Here’s the Latest,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-is-about-to-be-forced-onto-6-billion-devices-heres-the-latest/,"A growing number of discussions in digital finance focus on how cryptocurrencies may move from niche adoption into everyday infrastructure. CryptoStrix (@CryptoStrixx), a crypto expert and analyst on X, presented a thread on X with a sequence of assertions about a prospective, large-scale integration of XRP into consumer devices and financial infrastructure. The thread outlines a technical pathway, institutional movements, and market signals that together are presented as a coordinated rollout. Device Distribution and User Experience CryptoStrix wrote, “One OS update flips billions of phones into XRP wallets”. He stated that these wallets would be integrated directly into iOS and Android, meaning no downloads, no setup, and no barrier to entry. He argued that every phone number and email can function as a wallet address and that governments will have a direct channel to onboard citizens. Through this system, governments can provide financial incentives to drive adoption of this payment system, and this increased user base could reinforce XRP’s role as a bridge asset . Institutional Architecture and Service Providers The thread described an architecture in which central banks are positioned directly next to the XRP Ledger (XRPL), commercial banks sit behind them, and Ripple acts as the bridge between institutional money and the new rails. CryptoStrix listed major players testing these rails, such as JP Morgan , which has partnered with Ono Finance, and pilots run by Santander, PNC, and Bank of America. He further contended that many smaller institutions will lack the necessary infrastructure and will need to rent services from providers such as Ripple, Chainlink, Circle, and HBAR. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Indicators and Financial Products The thread reported that CME Group’s XRP futures open interest is now close to $1 billion, presenting this as evidence of institutional positioning. He projected that spot ETFs represent the next stage and that regulated products will allow pension funds and asset managers to allocate capital to XRP. CryptoStrix cited models that range XRP price potential from $8 to $80 under partial adoption and outlines a higher impact scenario in which 1,000 global banks each hold $500 million for liquidity. The Timeline for Global Change The narrative places XRP at the center of a broader market expansion, citing views that global crypto capitalization could move from approximately $4 trillion to $100 trillion within 8 to 10 years. He asserted that cycle indicators show no signs of a peak and that momentum may continue. XRP might be on the verge of a massive wave of increased integration and real-world utility , and CryptoStrix set a timeline pointing toward catalysts in late 2025, including ETF approvals, regulatory clarity, and institutional rollouts.

CEO Eric Demuth recently told the Financial Times that the exchange will instead consider either Frankfurt or New York when it moves ahead with a public offering. While no timeline has been set, he stressed that London was not on the table. Demuth noted that many companies are shifting away from the LSE. He pointed to British fintech Wise, whose shareholders voted last month to shift its primary listing to New York in search of deeper investor demand and better liquidity. He added that the London bourse is struggling with weak liquidity. Peter Thiel-backed crypto exchange Bitpanda rules out UK listing https://t.co/qgJa9s9G7N — Financial Times (@FT) August 26, 2025 Bitpanda didn’t return Cryptonews’ request for comment by press time. London’s IPO Market Sinks To Lowest Levels In Three Decades His remarks come as London struggles to maintain its role as a hub for initial public offerings. The UK’s IPO market has fallen to a 30-year low in 2025. In the first half of the year, only £160m ($216m) to £182.8m ($247.8m) was raised. By contrast, the 2021 peak reached £8.8b ($11.88b). Even when secondary issues are included, the total remains the weakest fundraising environment in decades. Demuth said another factor behind the decision was that Bitpanda had only recently launched in the UK and still generated most of its revenue from continental Europe. Bitpanda Looks To Align With Markets Offering Greater Liquidity The company’s stance reflects a broader trend. Increasingly, crypto firms are choosing to go public in the US or continental Europe. In these regions, regulators and investors are seen as more receptive. Moreover, the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq have emerged as the leading destinations. They are being buoyed by friendlier policies under the Trump administration and an influx of institutional capital. Earlier this year, Circle, the issuer of the USD Coin stablecoin, raised $1.05b on the NYSE at a valuation of roughly $8b. The Winklevoss twins’ Gemini exchange and crypto custodian BitGo have also filed to list in the US. Another Thiel-backed venue, Bullish, floated on the NYSE this month. The contrast shows London’s struggle to compete with deeper markets abroad. While the UK has sought to position itself as a fintech leader, thin trading volumes and diminished investor appetite have raised doubts about its attractiveness for high-growth technology companies. For Bitpanda, the decision points to its broader ambition to align with jurisdictions offering liquidity, regulatory clarity and investor enthusiasm.

It is the lowest level total cap has been since August 6, but it still remains within a six-week sideways channel despite the massive sell-off . CoinGlass reported that around 205,000 traders were liquidated over the past day, with total liquidations coming in over $930 million as leveraged long Bitcoin positions got flushed. Other analysts were suggesting that exchanges were dumping crypto assets in order to liquidate the long positions. Today’s painful, but not out of the ordinary, market slump has resulted in a 9% correction for overall crypto markets since their peak on August 14. Yesterday saw one of the largest #Bitcoin long liquidation events since Dec 2024, with over $150M in longs wiped out as price moved lower. pic.twitter.com/okCNBMWl0j — glassnode (@glassnode) August 25, 2025 Bitcoin Dragging Markets Down The big dump has been caused by Bitcoin, which crashed to a seven-week low of under $109,000 in early Asian trading on Tuesday morning on most exchanges. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView This was caused by a Bitcoin whale selling an entire batch of 24,000 BTC worth over $2.7 billion, causing the asset to plummet $4,000 a few hours that followed. According to Glassnode, Bitcoin has dropped below the average cost basis ($110,800) of one to three-month-old investors who accumulated during the May to July rally. “Historically, failure to hold above this level has often led to multi-month market weakness and potential deeper corrections,” it cautioned . The total BTC correction now stands at 12%, which is still much shallower than the pullbacks in September 2017 and 2021, during the bull market years when the asset retreated by 36% and 24%, respectively. A retreat between these two levels this September could see Bitcoin prices back at $87,000 before the bull market resumes. Altcoins Bleed Out As usual, the altcoins are suffering much more with major losses for Solana dumping over 11% to $186, Dogecoin dropping 10% in a fall to $0.21, Cardano sliding 9% to $0.83, and Chainlink tanking 11% to $23.30. Other altcoins in pain include Hyperliquid, Sui, Avalanche, and Litecoin. Ethereum has lost 7% on the day, but it remains within its sideways channel and had already started to recover at the time of writing, trading above $4,400 again. However, ETH has lost over 11% since its all-time high just two days ago. “It never “feels good” when you buy the dip. The dip comes when sentiment drops. Writing the number down can be a good form of discipline,” advised Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan. When the crypto market rips, everyone says: “I’ll buy bitcoin if it just pulls back to [insert number here].” Then, when the dip happens, they don’t act because the market doesn’t “feel” good at that point.

DOGE is now consolidating and might dip further below $0.2050. DOGE price started a fresh decline below the $0.220 level. The price is trading below the $0.2150 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.2160 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could start a fresh upward move if it stays above the $0.20 zone. Dogecoin Price Dips Again Dogecoin price started a fresh decline after there was a close below $0.2320, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . DOGE declined below the $0.220 and $0.2150 support levels. The price even traded below $0.210. A low was formed at $0.2059 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor recovery wave but the price is still below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.2672 swing high to the $0.2059 low.

There is also a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.2160 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. The first major resistance for the bulls could be near the $0.2280 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.2365 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.2672 swing high to the $0.2059 low. A close above the $0.2365 resistance might send the price toward the $0.2450 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.250 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.2550. Another Decline In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.2160 level, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.2060 level. The next major support is near the $0.2020 level. The main support sits at $0.20. If there is a downside break below the $0.20 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might slide toward the $0.1880 level or even $0.1820 in the near term.

A significant announcement from South Korean crypto exchange Bithumb has caught the attention of Conflux (CFX) holders. The exchange revealed a temporary CFX Suspension for all deposits and withdrawals, effective August 30th at 5:00 a.m. UTC. This isn’t a cause for alarm but rather a standard procedure to facilitate an upcoming mainnet upgrade for the Conflux network. Understanding the details of this halt is key for anyone holding or trading CFX. What is the CFX Suspension All About? Bithumb, a major player in the South Korean crypto market, made it clear that this temporary CFX Suspension is directly linked to a planned mainnet upgrade. A mainnet upgrade is essentially a significant improvement or update to a blockchain’s core software. Think of it like a major software update for your phone or computer, but for an entire decentralized network. During such upgrades, exchanges often pause deposit and withdrawal services to prevent any potential issues or loss of funds that could arise from transactions occurring on an old or transitioning network. The suspension specifically impacts Conflux (CFX) and will begin promptly at 5:00 a.m. UTC on August 30th. Users will be unable to move their CFX tokens into or out of their Bithumb accounts during this period. It is vital for users to be aware of this exact timing to plan their transactions accordingly. Why is a Conflux Mainnet Upgrade Necessary? Blockchain networks, like any advanced technology, require continuous development and enhancement. A mainnet upgrade brings several benefits, often including improved security, increased transaction speed, enhanced scalability, and the introduction of new features. For Conflux, this upgrade aims to strengthen its underlying infrastructure, making the network more robust and efficient for its users and developers. While a temporary CFX Suspension might seem inconvenient, it is a necessary step to ensure a smooth transition and the long-term health of the Conflux ecosystem. These upgrades are a sign of an active and evolving project, dedicated to improving its technology. Such technical advancements are fundamental to maintaining a competitive edge in the rapidly evolving blockchain space. By undergoing this upgrade, Conflux demonstrates its commitment to providing a cutting-edge platform for decentralized applications and digital assets. Ultimately, these improvements benefit all CFX holders by potentially increasing the network’s utility and value. How Does This CFX Suspension Affect You? For Bithumb users holding Conflux (CFX), the primary impact is the inability to initiate deposits or withdrawals during the specified period. This means if you need to access your CFX tokens for trading on other platforms, or if you plan to deposit CFX into Bithumb, you must complete these actions before the August 30th deadline. Conversely, any CFX held within your Bithumb account will remain secure and accessible for internal trading on the exchange, although external transfers will be halted. It is important to remember that this is a temporary measure. Once the Conflux mainnet upgrade is successfully completed and Bithumb has verified the stability of the upgraded network, deposit and withdrawal services for CFX will resume. Bithumb typically provides updates on the exact resumption time, so keeping an eye on their official announcements is highly recommended. Preparing for the CFX Suspension: Key Actions To navigate this period smoothly, consider these actionable insights: Review Your Holdings: Check your current CFX balance on Bithumb and determine if you need to move any funds before August 30th, 5:00 a.m. UTC. Plan Ahead: If you have any pending transactions or plans involving CFX deposits or withdrawals, execute them well in advance of the suspension time. Stay Informed: Regularly monitor Bithumb’s official announcements and their social media channels for updates regarding the upgrade and the resumption of CFX Suspension services. Security First: Ensure your Bithumb account has strong security measures enabled, such as two-factor authentication (2FA). Your funds remain secure on the exchange during the suspension. Taking these proactive steps will help minimize any potential inconvenience and ensure you are well-prepared for the temporary halt in CFX services. In conclusion, Bithumb’s announcement of a temporary CFX Suspension for deposits and withdrawals is a proactive measure to support the Conflux network’s essential mainnet upgrade. While it requires users to plan their transactions carefully, it ultimately signifies a positive step towards a more robust and efficient Conflux blockchain. Staying informed through official channels is your best strategy to navigate this period seamlessly. Embrace these upgrades as a sign of progress in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Here are some common questions regarding the Bithumb CFX Suspension: Q: Why is Bithumb suspending CFX deposits and withdrawals? A: Bithumb is temporarily suspending these services to facilitate a planned mainnet upgrade for the Conflux (CFX) network. This is a standard procedure to ensure a smooth transition and prevent transaction issues. Q: When will the CFX Suspension begin? A: The suspension for Conflux (CFX) deposits and withdrawals will begin at 5:00 a.m. UTC on August 30th. Q: Can I still trade CFX on Bithumb during the suspension? A: Yes, you can still trade CFX internally on the Bithumb exchange. The suspension only affects deposits and withdrawals to and from external wallets or other exchanges. Q: What should I do if I need to move my CFX tokens? A: If you need to deposit or withdraw CFX, you must complete these transactions before the suspension begins at 5:00 a.m. UTC on August 30th. Plan your actions accordingly. Q: When will CFX deposits and withdrawals resume? A: Services will resume once the Conflux mainnet upgrade is successfully completed and Bithumb has verified the network’s stability.

If fully executed, the program could boost its holdings to nearly 5,000 BTC, putting it on par with companies like Semler Scientific. The move comes as Bitcoin trades around $109,866, down from its mid-August all-time high, and amid rising competition from Ethereum treasury firms fueling ETH’s surge. Meanwhile, Michael Saylor’s Strategy added another 3,081 BTC last week, bringing its total to over 632,000 BTC despite a slower August accumulation pace. Sequans Pushes Bitcoin Treasury Growth French semiconductor company Sequans Communications took a bold step in its Bitcoin treasury strategy by filing for a $200 million at-the-market equity offering with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The program will enable the Paris-based 4G and 5G chipmaker to issue American Depositary Shares (ADS) at its discretion, and the proceeds will primarily be used to expand its Bitcoin holdings. CEO Georges Karam said the move will be deployed “judiciously” to strengthen the company’s balance sheet, enhance Bitcoin per share, and deliver long-term value for shareholders. Sequans currently holds 3,171 BTC, which is worth approximately $349 million at current prices. This makes it Europe’s second-largest corporate Bitcoin holder behind Germany’s Bitcoin Group SE, which owns 12,387 BTC. The company first unveiled its plan to use Bitcoin as a core treasury reserve in June, and set an ambitious goal of accumulating 100,000 BTC by 2030. If fully executed, the new equity program could add 1,814 BTC at current market prices, pushing Sequans’ total reserves close to 5,000 BTC—putting it on par with US-based Semler Scientific’s Bitcoin treasury. This development is part of a wider trend of corporations embracing digital assets. In fact, 174 public companies now hold Bitcoin, which is up from fewer than 100 at the start of the year. Still, the move also coincides with Bitcoin’s recent pullback to around $109,866, or 12% below its all-time high of $124,517 that was reached on Aug. 14. BTC’s price action over the past week (Source: CoinMarketCap ) However, corporate enthusiasm for Bitcoin was recently tempered by the rise of Ethereum treasury companies. BitMine Immersion Technologies, which was once a Bitcoin mining company, now holds $7.5 billion worth of ETH, making it the second-largest crypto treasury overall. Firms like SharpLink and The Ether Machine also established sizable ETH holdings . This trend helped drive Ethereum’s 198% price surge since April. Sequans’ latest move therefore proves its commitment to Bitcoin. Strategy Adds More BTC Michael Saylor’s company Strategy, the world’s largest public Bitcoin holder, also recently expanded its holdings despite recent market volatility. According to an SEC filing on Monday, the firm bought 3,081 BTC for $356.9 million during the week ending Sunday. The purchase was made at an average price of $115,829 per coin, with Bitcoin starting the week near $116,700 before dipping to $112,000 on Thursday. This latest buy brought Strategy’s total stash to 632,457 BTC, which was accumulated at a total cost of about $46.5 billion and an average purchase price of $73,527 per coin. The move also adds to a series of smaller acquisitions from earlier this month, including 430 BTC that was announced last Monday and 155 BTC the week before. With 3,666 BTC purchased so far in August, the pace is much slower compared to July, when the company accumulated 31,466 BTC, and June, when it bought 17,075 BTC. It remains to be seen if Strategy will return to heavier buying before the month closes or continue its more measured pace. Strategy BTC buys over time (Source: SaylorTracker ) Historically, Saylor expressed little interest in waiting for dips, preferring to buy Bitcoin regardless of price. He reiterated this stance in 2024 when he said, “I’m going to be buying the top forever. Bitcoin is the exit strategy.” Even with slower purchases, Strategy’s Bitcoin key performance indicators still continued to climb. Its BTC yield, which tracks the percentage change in the ratio between holdings and assumed diluted shares outstanding, recently reached 25.4%. That figure surpasses its earlier 2025 goal of 25%, which prompted the company in July to raise its target to 30% by year-end. At the same time, it lifted its Bitcoin gain target from $15 billion to $20 billion. As of Monday, Strategy’s year-to-date Bitcoin gain stood at 113,524 BTC. For now, there is no end in sight for the company’s aggressive accumulation strategy and its role as the largest corporate force in the Bitcoin market.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|REGULATION|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-26 05:30:00

Analysts consistently highlight Cardano and Bitcoin for their staying power, but a newer entrant—MAGACOIN FINANCE—is beginning to cut through the noise. Its growing traction places it alongside the majors on lists of the seven best altcoins to watch before the next rally takes hold. Cardano (ADA) — Methodical Growth and Scaling Potential Cardano continues to be praised for its steady development approach and strong governance model. Upcoming upgrades like Hydra scaling and expanded on-chain governance are expected to strengthen the network’s efficiency. Analysts forecast ADA could climb to $1–$1.5 by late 2025, with more bullish estimates calling for $2.5–$3 if institutional inflows accelerate. For risk-aware investors seeking consistent exposure, Cardano remains a reliable long-term pick. Bitcoin (BTC) — The Market’s Anchor Asset Bitcoin is holding near $114,000 and remains the asset that anchors every crypto market cycle. Its price action sets the tone for altcoins, with rallies in BTC often preceding broader market breakouts. While percentage upside is lower compared to smaller tokens, Bitcoin offers unmatched liquidity and security, making it the essential hedge within every diversified portfolio. MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGA) — Breakout Presale Contender Analysts looking at the best altcoins ahead of the next market cycle often point to established names like Bitcoin and Cardano. But within those conversations, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly surfacing as the breakout contender. Its early accumulation trend and building momentum are being compared to past cycles where overlooked projects went on to deliver some of the market’s biggest gains. The crypto presale project has already attracted significant whale and retail interest, and forecasts now place MAGACOIN FINANCE among the highest-upside opportunities of 2025. This positioning makes MAGACOIN FINANCE the high-risk, high-reward play in analyst shortlists. It carries the same speculative energy that propelled Dogecoin and Shiba Inu in prior runs, but with growing signs of investor conviction that it could sustain momentum beyond the presale phase. Other Top Altcoins for the Bull Run Alongside ADA, BTC, and MAGA, analysts frequently include Solana, Ethereum, XRP, and meme tokens like PEPE in their shortlists. Solana’s strong ecosystem growth and ETF momentum, Ethereum’s ETF inflows and DeFi leadership, and XRP’s payments focus all keep them in play. Meanwhile, PEPE continue to hold trader attention, though newer meme-driven entrants like MAGACOIN are drawing the bigger upside projections. Key Takeaways Essentially, market observers agree that diversification remains key heading into the next cycle. So, while established assets like Bitcoin and Cardano provide stability, Solana and Ethereum are capturing interest from investors focused on scalability and DeFi activity. But it is MAGACOIN FINANCE that is increasingly being positioned as the breakout presale play—with upside forecasts that rival some of the most explosive rallies in crypto history.

He stated that the asset’s chart shows that “things are about to move higher… a lot higher.” The timing of his remarks coincides with renewed optimism surrounding XRP following the conclusion of Ripple’s legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which removed one of the largest regulatory uncertainties that had hung over the token for years. I'm not a TA guy but I think the XRP chart is looking like things are about to move higher… a lot higher — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) August 24, 2025 XRP Community’s Response Responses to his post reflected a wide spectrum of opinions. One user questioned the legitimacy of XRP outright, labeling it a scam. While many detractors share this view , Claver responded directly, stating, “I think you have been misinformed,” rejecting the criticism while maintaining his bullish tone. XRP’s track record in the crypto space shows that it is here to stay. Another commenter shifted the conversation, stating that XRP will rise and not crash, adding that the price increase is certain. Skepticism also emerged from another participant, who argued that XRP would never reclaim its previous high of $3.65, calling that level the asset’s top. Claver countered this comment with a GIF of U.S. President Donald Trump, who has consistently supported XRP , saying the word “wrong.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Will XRP Make New Millionaires? One user dismissed the notion that a relatively small holding of 500 XRP could yield life-changing wealth. Claver countered with a reminder that similar doubts once circulated about Bitcoin in its early years, subtly drawing a comparison between market skepticism across cycles. Recent reports suggest that institutions are shifting their focus from Bitcoin to XRP . While Bitcoin remains the largest asset in the crypto market, many experts are convinced that XRP can take its place . Just as people doubted Bitcoin in the early years, those who doubt XRP could miss out on life-changing gains if Claver’s prediction comes true. A Market in Transition The end of Ripple’s legal battle has undeniably reshaped the narrative around XRP, allowing speculation to shift back toward market structure and adoption milestones. With the asset already making significant headway in the real-world asset tokenization space, investors can expect a big move soon.

Trump reportedly warned of “200% tariffs or something” on China if it limits rare-earth magnet exports, and vowed retaliation against countries targeting U.S. Big Tech, calling such moves “discriminatory.” Separately, President Donald Trump announced the removal of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook over allegations of mortgage fraud. The move sparked concerns about the Fed’s independence and its ability to conduct monetary policy without political interference. Silver prices climbed above $38.7 per ounce on Tuesday, rebounding from the previous session’s losses. Gold prices rose above $3,370 per ounce on Tuesday, reaching its highest level in two weeks amid heightened political uncertainty. Japan ( NKY:IND ) fell 0.87% to below 42,300, while the broader Topix Index lost 0.8% to 3,080 on Tuesday, snapping a two-day winning streak. The Japanese yen strengthened toward 147 per dollar on Tuesday, recovering losses from the previous session. The U.S. is set to announce a USD 550 billion Japanese investment package this week, according to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Monday. The funds may support U.S. manufacturing in semiconductors, antibiotics, and rare earths. Traders also looked ahead to a slate of key Japanese economic data later this week, including industrial production, retail sales, and consumer confidence figures. China ( SHCOMP ) fell 0.16% to around 3,870 while the Shenzhen Component rose 0.3% to 12,480 on Tuesday, with mainland shares posting mixed performances as renewed trade concerns weighed on sentiment, and the offshore yuan held its recent gains to around 7.15 per dollar on Tuesday, trading close to its highest level in over four weeks. President Donald Trump said Monday he may impose a 200% tariff on Chinese goods if China refuses to sell magnets to the U.S., following Beijing’s tighter grip on rare earth mining. “They have to give us magnets,” Trump said during an Oval Office meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung. China holds cotton quota steady despite trade slump, China will allocate 200,000 metric tons of sliding tariff rate cotton import quotas to textile firms in the processing trade, matching last year’s volume, according to the National Development and Reform Commission. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 0.11% to 25,734 in Tuesday morning’s session, snapping a two-day rally. India ( SENSEX ) fell 0.71% to 81,025 in morning trade on Tuesday, halting gains from the previous session and hitting its lowest level in nearly two weeks. The Indian rupee edged lower to below 87.65 per dollar on Tuesday, marking its fourth consecutive session of losses, as market sentiment remained clouded by tariff concerns. The Trump Administration outlined plans to implement a 50% tariff on products from India in a draft notice published Monday, as reported by Bloomberg.com. The increased levies would apply to Indian products “that are entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time on August 27, 2025.” Fitch Ratings affirmed India’s sovereign rating at ‘BBB-’ with a stable outlook on Monday, citing robust growth but flagging weak fiscal metrics. Australia ( AS51 ) fell 0.49% to 8,955 on Tuesday, reversing modest gains from the previous session. The Australian dollar held its decline around $0.648 on Tuesday, as investors weighed the latest minutes from the Reserve Bank of Australia. Minutes from the Reserve Bank of Australia’s August meeting show that the central bank plans to guide the pace of future cash rate cuts based on new economic data. The board unanimously voted on August 12 to lower the cash rate by 25 basis points, marking the third reduction this year and bringing borrowing costs to their lowest level since April 2023. Attention now turns to the upcoming monthly CPI report later this week, expected to show faster inflation and reinforce views of a brief policy pause before further easing. In the U.S. on Monday, all three major indexes ended lower as investors took a breather from last week’s powerful rally. Attention turned toward Nvidia’s highly anticipated earnings report due Wednesday and the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge scheduled for release on Friday. U.S. stock futures fell further on Tuesday after the major averages slipped to start the week, as investors took a breather following last week’s strong rally: Dow -0.09% ; S&P 500 -0.07% ; Nasdaq -0.11% .

McGlone reminded that Bitcoin's average price during the year is at $100,000, and stated that this level is likely to be tested again in the short term. According to the analyst, volatility remains low as the crypto market experiences a summer lull. However, McGlone believes that Bitcoin could pull back towards support levels once the VIX index rises above 20 again. Related News: What is the Status of the Altcoin Season? How Far Away is the Critical Threshold that Needs to be Crossed? Here are the Tokens that are Performing Better than Bitcoin “Even though Bitcoin, the world's most speculative digital asset, has reached new highs, a normalization process is inevitable. There is a risk that Bitcoin will break its support level towards the end of the year,” McGlone said, arguing that extreme speculative movements are being seen in crypto assets in the current environment. McGlone stated that Bitcoin will continue to be a leading indicator of risk appetite in the long term, while pointing out that the Fed's tight monetary policy pressure against inflation and global economic weakening could create more volatility in the markets. *This is not investment advice.

A burst of institutional liquidation during the 19:00–20:00 GMT hour drove the sharpest drop, with volumes tripling daily averages. Recovery attempts late in the session brought the token back above $2.90, but the market remains split on whether upside momentum can sustain. News Background XRP has traded with elevated volatility through August, with repeated failures above $3.00. Whale wallets and institutional flows have driven short-term swings, adding pressure on retail positioning. Broader crypto benchmarks posted steadier gains, leaving XRP trailing peers amid regulatory overhang in the U.S. Crypto exchange Gemini, founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, told CoinDesk it has teamed up with Ripple to launch an XRP edition of its credit card in partnership with WebBank. The card offers up to 4% cashback in XRP on fuel, EV charging and rideshare, 3% on dining, 2% on groceries and 1% on other purchases. Gemini said it is also working with select merchants to offer up to 10% back on eligible spending. Price Action Summary XRP declined 3.24% from $3.01 to $2.91 in 24 hours, within a $0.28 range (9% volatility). Peak selling occurred between 19:00–20:00 GMT as XRP fell from $2.96 to $2.84 on 217.58 million volume, far above the 72.45 million daily average. The token rebounded 0.69% in the final trading hour, climbing from $2.89 to $2.91 with institutional flows averaging 641,000 per minute. Technical Analysis Resistance confirmed at $2.96, aligning with upper Bollinger Band rejection. Support built at $2.84–$2.86, consistent with the 20-day moving average zone. $2.89 intraday floor shows accumulation, with RSI recovering from oversold levels near 42 to mid-50s, suggesting stabilizing momentum. MACD histogram narrowing toward a bullish crossover, signaling potential shift in short-term trend. Sustained trading above $2.90 needed to open path toward $3.20–$3.30; break below $2.84 risks slide toward $2.80 support. What Traders Are Watching Bulls target $3.70 if momentum extends and volumes normalize. Bears flag $2.80 as the breakdown level that could accelerate losses.

August 2025-In the current wave of crypto market recovery, the traditional strategy of “holding coins without moving” is quietly changing to a new way of thinking of “holding coins to create income”. Especially in the Dogecoin (DOGE) community, more and more coin holders are earning considerable daily income through the world’s leading BlockchainCloudMining platform-up to $5,700, triggering a wave of heated discussions and participation in the community about “coins making profits”. Transformation moment for Dogecoin holders Since the advent of DOGE, this “joke coin” derived from Internet culture has had amazing vitality. Although its price has fluctuated greatly, its huge community base and expanding application scenarios have proved its durability in the crypto ecosystem. However, in the face of the ever-changing market environment, DOGE holders have gradually realized that relying solely on rising and falling profits is risky, and “activating” assets and generating stable cash flow may be the wise direction for future investment. It is in this context that BlockchainCloudMining has become the “star platform” in this asset reconfiguration revolution. The “low threshold and high return” logic of cloud mining platforms BlockchainCloudMining is a professional cloud mining platform headquartered in the UK. Since its launch in 2018, it has been committed to providing simple, safe and efficient mining solutions for global crypto users. Users do not need to build their own mines, purchase hardware, and maintain equipment. They only need to register an account and select a contract to start 24-hour automatic mining and obtain daily settled income. Security and Sustainability In the field of mining, trust and security are crucial. Blockchain Cloud Mining (BlockchainCloudMining) knows this well and puts user safety first. Blockchain Cloud Mining ( BlockchainCloudMining ) is committed to transparency and legality, ensuring that your investment is protected and allowing you to focus on profitability.

Even in extreme market conditions or policy changes, it can still ensure the stable operation of contracts and the payment of daily income as scheduled. In short: a “static income revolution” for DOGE users In the past, DOGE was the “ happy fruit ” of the crypto world; now, with the BlockchainCloudMining platform, it is gradually becoming a “ passive income engine .” If holding coins is a belief, then letting the assets you hold continue to work for you is a smarter continuation of belief. For more and more DOGE users, cloud mining is not only an investment option, but also a long-term asset management strategy.

Key Takeaways: Taylor Thomson reportedly lost over $80 million in crypto investments managed with guidance tied to a psychic. Her former friend Ashley Richardson allegedly executed 450,000 trades. The dispute has led to lawsuits and countersuits, with Thomson settling with blockchain project Persistence. According to a Wall Street Journal (WSJ) report published Monday, Thomson, a member of the family behind media and financial giant Thomson Reuters, poured millions into cryptocurrencies with the assistance of her former best friend, Ashley Richardson. The two women had allegedly consulted a celebrity psychic and other spiritual advisers before Richardson became heavily involved in managing Thomson’s crypto holdings. Richardson Oversaw $140M in Crypto at Bull Market Peak At the height of the 2021 bull market, Richardson was said to oversee more than $140 million in Thomson’s digital assets spread across multiple wallets. But the sharp downturn in crypto markets in mid-2022 devastated the portfolio. Consulting firm Guidepost Solutions estimated Thomson’s losses at over $80 million and claimed Richardson executed more than 450,000 trades without proper authorization, exposing her to high-risk strategies. Richardson rejected the allegations, arguing she acted under Thomson’s direction and only made trades to maintain liquidity in thinly traded tokens. She emphasized that there was no formal contract between them, only a verbal agreement, and insisted she never profited personally. “Everything I did was based on her instructions, as part of her effort to minimize losses,” Richardson told the WSJ. The dispute escalated into a legal battle in 2023. Thomson filed a lawsuit against Richardson and Persistence (XPRT), a proof-of-stake blockchain project launched in 2021. She had invested $40 million in its native token, which has since collapsed in value. XPRT peaked at $16.59 on May 15, 2021, according to CoinGecko, but currently trades at about $0.037 — a drop of 99% from its all-time high. Thomson is seeking $25 million in damages, alleging Richardson and Persistence arranged a secret “finder’s fee” for Richardson and misrepresented the investment. A Thomson spokesperson dismissed Richardson’s narrative, saying: “Ms. Richardson has taken her bogus story to the media in an attempt to extract more money from Ms. Thomson.” Richardson has countersued for $10 million, claiming defamation after Thomson allegedly told others she had committed fraud. According to the WSJ, Thomson has since reached a settlement with Persistence, but the case against Richardson remains ongoing. Investor Loses $3M in Crypto Phishing Scam As reported, a cryptocurrency investor has fallen victim to a phishing scam , losing $3.05 million in Tether (USDT) after unknowingly signing a malicious blockchain transaction. The loss, flagged by blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain on Wednesday, underscores the rising threat of phishing attacks targeting digital asset holders. The attacker exploited a common habit among crypto users: validating only the first and last few characters of a wallet address while ignoring the middle. Crypto investors lost over $2.2 billion to hacks , scams, and breaches in the first half of 2025, driven largely by wallet compromises and phishing attacks, according to CertiK’s latest security report. Wallet breaches alone caused $1.7 billion in losses across just 34 incidents, while phishing scams accounted for over $410 million across 132 attacks.

Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, XRP does not rely on traditional blockchain mining mechanisms, but uses a consensus algorithm for transaction verification. This design makes XRP transaction confirmation time usually only a few seconds, much faster than other mainstream cryptocurrencies. The main goal of the Ripple network is to work with traditional financial institutions to replace the expensive and slow international remittance system. At present, many banks and financial services companies have piloted or adopted RippleNet technology to improve payment efficiency. Although XRP is affected by regulatory issues and legal proceedings in the market, its technological potential is still widely concerned.

Investors who have held Cardano since 2021 or earlier are still not leaving and accumulating more of the asset. According to the latest price moves, ADA returned from support at $0.70 to reach as high as $0.81. In other words, it saw a 13% rise over the week. Analysts predict a rally for the token toward $1.01-$1.15 if resistance around $0.884 breaks. When investors consistently react this way, the stage is set for the next reinforcement. New market players will also begin to take note of early-growth stories like MAGACOIN FINANCE, looking for the upside opportunity that fits Cardano’s longer rhythm. 1. On-Chain Foundations Signal Renewed Momentum Recent data provides a positive view, not just from price moves but network activity as well. According to Santiment, the accumulation of whales is surging. Wallets holding between 10-100 million ADA tokens have added 130 million ADA in the past few days. This occurred while other cohorts trimmed their positions. Network engagement is robust. In the month of August 2025, ADA handled around 2.6 million transactions on a daily basis, aggregating to approximately 450 million transactions in the first half of that year. Future indicators are positive—funding rates are climbing, MVRV Z-scores are above 0.4, and long-term ADA futures open interest has soared to $1.44 billion. These figures indicate more demand than supply and a healthy base of holders looking for long-term gains. 2. Cardano’s Long-Term Holder Conviction Even though the market moves a lot in the short term, the investors driving ADA are here for the long term. On chain data by Alphractal suggest that some long term holders will not be selling despite macro uncertainty. These behaviors are just the opposite of sell-pressure that dominated rallies in previous cycles. Right now, some large holders think there is over an 80% chance that an ADA ETF will get approved, the foundation is becoming something solid. While ADA development narrative gets more attention, another narrative is busily getting developed. When the big players stop moving, speculative money shifts to fresh narratives. Some presale analysts are suggesting MAGACOIN FINANCE to be one of the top breakout candidates of 2025. Why is that so? The the audit is over, and presale rounds are closing! MAGACOIN FINANCE has the narrative edge, whether ADA’s path is charted for several months ahead or not. If market cycles follow their regular patterns, gains may be over 100% from here. This doesn’t undermine ADA, it complements it. Investing in both long-term structural plays like Cardano and high-beta early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE can provide a balance of stability and upside. 3. Price Outlook: Is $1 ADA Back in Play? Many predictions for Cardano ADA suggest that it may surpass the $1 mark. According to the projections from Coinpedia analysts, the price of ADA can rise up to $2.05 by the end of 2025. However, this will only be a case if all the stars align including ETF approval and extensive retail adoption. Yahoo Finance expect the price to average near$0.945, which is a roughly 79% return from the current price. Bullish estimates range from $0.94 to $2.69 and depend on momentum and ecosystem developer adoption. Due to significant resistances building above $0.88 and growing institutional sentiment, ADA is in a good place to confirm $1 as its new baseline range support. 4. Conclusion: Holder Solidarity Sets Stage for Breakout Cardano’s investors are not holding, they are stacking. As prices decrease and jump, the investors have been accumulating Cardano. Increased whale activity, rising on-chain activity, and technicals suggest ADA price breakout of a bullish pattern. The emphasis on stability, along with widespread interest from institutional holders and ETF optimism, argues a unique inflection point. CARDANO is a great base and MAGACOIN FINANCE is a speculative option with high-upside for investors that prefer a balanced strategy.

Key Developments After Falling To $112,000",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/whats-next-for-bitcoin-key-developments-after-falling-to-112000/,"The market’s leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), has recently attempted to stabilize around $112,000 after experiencing a sharp decline to $110,000 on Sunday, meaning a 10% drop from all-time high (ATH) levels. Ahead of the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) September meeting, market expert Doctor Profit highlighted on X (formerly Twitter) the upcoming implications and the most important technical indicators that paint a bleak picture for Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader market. Fed Rate Cut To Trigger A New Market Correction? Doctor Profit emphasized that the current market environment is markedly different from previous cycles. He believes that the anticipated rate cut by the Fed next month could initiate a robust correction in both stocks and cryptocurrencies. According to him, the first significant cut typically brings uncertainty, leading to divergent opinions among investors, and he predicts that this time will be no exception. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Demand Surges On Binance As Price Nears $5,000 Turning to Bitcoin’s technical indicators, the outlook appears bearish. The expert noted a substantial Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) gap around the $93,000 mark that needs addressing, with most liquidity concentrated in the $90,000 to $95,000 range. The charts indicate a potential correction, highlighted by a double top formation and declining trading volume. Notably, Doctor Profit has asserted that the last price surge that saw BTC reach $124,000, was largely driven by futures rather than spot market activity, reinforcing the bearish sentiment. Bitcoin Price Forecast Market psychology plays a crucial role in this analysis. On-chain metrics and sentiment indicators reveal that retail investors often buy high and sell low. The expert disclosed that during Bitcoin’s last dip from $110,000 to $98,000 between May and June of this year, it was primarily institutional investors who capitalized on the lower prices, while retail buyers missed out. As prices climbed, retail investors entered the market at higher levels, Doctor Profit added, which could lead to a shakeout as Bitcoin approaches the critical liquidation zone of $90,000 to $95,000. Related Reading: Analyst Says It Doesn’t Matter What Analysis You Use, XRP Price Is Set To Explode Beyond Bitcoin’s price action, Doctor Profit warns that the current market sentiment reflects a false sense of optimism, suggesting that the prevalent belief in a sustained altcoin season is misguided. He cautions that as enthusiasm grows, larger players may begin to offload their positions, leaving retail investors exposed. Looking ahead, he forecasts a potential surge in Bitcoin prices towards $145,000 to $150,000, which could potentially mean a 34% increase from current levels. The expert also expects Ethereum (ETH) to reach between $7,000 and $8,000 following the September correction. When writing, Bitcoin trades at $112,560, recording a 6% drop in the fourteen-days time frame. Ethereum on the other hand, has continuously positioned among the market’s top performers with a 5% surge during the same period.

Just like the ADA price, the Cardano open interest has also stealthily been on the rise and has even reached all-time high levels amid all the ruckus. Even with the market correction, the open interest has continued to trend high, and with this heightened participation, it could trigger another wave of uptrend for the cryptocurrency. How High Is Cardano Open Interest? According to data from Coinglass, the Cardano open interest has already beaten its previous all-time high that was set back in January 2025. On August 18, the open interest had risen to $1.87 billion, recording the highest point so far. This new all-time high had come after weeks of steady climb in the open interest. It had followed the rise in the ADA price, which had resulted in a new 5-month high after climbing above $0.9 in the month of August. Since then, the open interest has remained relatively high, maintaining an average of $1.5 billion per day. Since the open interest refers to the amount of all futures or options contracts for a digital asset, it suggests that more and more crypto traders have been taking an interest in the Cardano price at this time. Usually, a rise in the open interest suggests that investors are bullish , and a decline suggests that they are bearish. This means that Cardano investors are still expecting the price to rise from here, and with the current price point, $1 is a good target for where a push might send the ADA price next. However, if there is a sharp decline in the open interest, then the ADA price could end up crashing with it. Major Levels To Watch For ADA Price As interest in Cardano has grown, crypto analyst CryptoPulse has outlined the major levels to watch for the ADA price going forward. This comes as the altcoin reclaimed a key level above $0.8, and is now testing it as support. Thus, a breakout could be imminent. The first of these levels is the 0.382 Fibonacci level, which coincides with the $1.01 price point . Next I $1.1405 at the 05. Fibonacci level, and lastly, the 0.618 Fibonacci level that would put the ADA price as high as $1.27-4. “As long as price holds above the key level, higher targets remain on the table. Losing it, and we look back to range lows,” the analyst said.",Cardano|ADA|ADA news|ADA open interest|ADA Price|adausd|ADAUSDT|Cardano news|Cardano open interest|Cardano Price|open interest,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ADA|TRADING|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-26 06:00:11

MAGACOIN Finance Surges as BNB Crashes and Market FUD Spikes,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/1-presale-for-2025-magacoin-finance-surges-as-bnb-crashes-and-market-fud-spikes/,"Crypto markets remain volatile as Bitcoin faces downward pressure and BNB records fresh dips. Yet amid the uncertainty, MAGACOIN Finance has surfaced as the best crypto presale 2025, offering early investors a 50% bonus with the code PATRIOT50X. Market FUD Intensifies as Bitcoin Struggles The broader market is battling heavy selling pressure as Bitcoin fell to $112,890 this week, a 9% slide from its recent $124,457 peak. Analysts warn that if Bitcoin fails to reclaim the $120K–$122K range, a deeper move toward $88,000 could be on the cards. These warnings have added to overall fear, with traders treading cautiously after seven days of consistent pullbacks. Despite the bearish narrative, many are looking at altcoins as hedges and diversification plays, especially projects with limited downside exposure. While Bitcoin consolidates, the search for assets offering security during downturns has intensified. This sets the stage for presale opportunities to gain traction as traders explore safer entry points into the market. BNB Price Faces Pressure but Adoption Expands BNB dipped 1% in the past 24 hours, tracking Bitcoin’s weakness, but its network continues to see stronger real-world adoption. Bitpanda recently launched a DeFi wallet supporting over 5,000 tokens on BNB Chain, making access easier for millions of users. At the same time, KiloEx joined CoinMarketCap and SpaceID in the BNB Guardians coalition, further cementing BNB’s role in Web3 infrastructure. Institutional interest is also rising, with Windtree Therapeutics reportedly buying $500 million worth of BNB, and Nasdaq-listed BNC adding $160 million to its treasury. Social sentiment has turned bullish, with forecasts pointing to $1,000 and beyond by 2026. Still, for now, BNB’s short-term price action remains tied to Bitcoin’s performance, leaving traders cautious until clear recovery signals emerge. MAGACOIN Finance Presale: Early Bonus & Safe Haven Appeal While BNB and Bitcoin face price turbulence, MAGACOIN Finance is holding steady and has become one of the most talked-about opportunities in 2025. The altcoin offers early investors a 50% EXTRA BONUS with the code PATRIOT50X, available for a limited time. This presale deal positions it as the best crypto presale to buy for those seeking hedge, diversification, and a safer allocation during market crashes. With altcoins gaining attention as alternatives in times of fear, MAGACOIN Finance has become attractive for traders wanting early exposure at locked-in stage pricing before exchange listings. Importantly, its ability to maintain stability while major assets like BNB dip underlines its appeal as a safe haven option. But urgency is key—this bonus structure and discounted pricing won’t last beyond the presale phase. What Should Traders Do Next? With Bitcoin uncertainty and BNB tied to its swings, diversification into altcoins looks sensible. MAGACOIN Finance’s presale, with its 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, offers one of the clearest entry points before exchange listings. Traders looking to act should not delay—presale phases are time-limited, and entry prices will only rise.

Here’s What Is Happening,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-xrp-is-repeating-history-heres-what-is-happening/,"XRP’s market history has often defined extended consolidation phases followed by sharp breakouts. In 2017, the token experienced one of its most notable rallies, moving from fractions of a cent to a multi-dollar peak within months. That same pattern of consolidation and expansion is now being examined in the current market cycle. Crypto analyst Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto) recently presented a chart that places the 2017 XRP breakout next to the 2025 price structure. The side-by-side comparison highlights structural similarities between the two periods. Both showed a clear Elliott Wave pattern with consolidation forming a symmetrical triangular structure before the final upward move. #XRP history is repeating again! pic.twitter.com/NGpiq3URDD — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 24, 2025 Comparing Both Cycles The 2017 chart shows XRP moving through a series of waves before entering a triangular formation around the middle of 2017. Once that pattern was resolved, the token surged to $3.36, marking its highest valuation at the time. The monthly chart from that cycle shows five distinct waves, ending with a sharp vertical climb. The current 2025 chart reflects a near-identical setup. XRP has already completed three upward waves, beginning in mid-2024. The asset completed the third wave in January, when it surged over 500%, and entered a consolidation phase , marking the beginning of the fourth wave and the symmetrical triangle that contributed to the surge in 2017. According to the chart comparison, XRP has now entered the fifth wave. The asset began this run in July, when it broke out of the symmetrical triangle, and rose to a new all-time high of $3.65 . The similarity between both journeys suggests that XRP’s climb isn’t over. Although its momentum seems to have stalled, Steph’s analysis suggests this run could culminate in a double-digit target. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Updated Targets for XRP’s Breakout Based on the projected path shown in the 2025 chart, XRP could be setting up for a target well above its recent trading range. The green projection box in the chart highlights an area that extends past $10, with the upper boundary approaching $12 . This implies the possibility of a multi-fold increase from XRP’s current price, which remains just above $3. The structural symmetry between the two cycles supports the view that XRP may follow a comparable trajectory. While no chart pattern guarantees identical results, the resemblance between the 2017 and 2025 setups gives technical analysts reason to consider higher targets in the event of a breakout.

According to Bloomberg, the Minister added that the government is careful not to stifle innovation with excessive regulations.

Financial repression aims to reduce the government's debt burden through methods such as inflation, low or negative real interest rates, currency depreciation, and capital controls.

50695550,565216,1756191600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50695550.jpeg,Bitcoin Reacts To Trump Axing Fed Governor Cook – Here’s What It Means,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-trump-axing-fed-governor-cook/,"Bitcoin reacted swiftly late Monday after President Donald Trump said he is removing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa D. Cook “effective immediately,” invoking the Federal Reserve Act’s “for cause” clause and citing alleged false statements on 2021 mortgage applications. Cook rejected the move, said she will not resign, and has retained counsel, setting up an unprecedented legal clash over presidential power and Fed independence. Cook, a Biden appointee, was reconfirmed in 2023 to a term running to January 31, 2038, and—as a member of the Board of Governors—holds a permanent vote on the FOMC. As the headlines hit Asia and Europe overnight, Bitcoin slipped alongside a wobbly dollar and US rates curve. At press time, BTC traded around $110,137, down roughly 2.4% on the session, after an intraday low at $108,666. How Will Bitcoin React Long-Term? The legal stakes are enormous. Reuters reports Trump’s letter accuses Cook of “deceitful and potentially criminal conduct in a financial matter,” while legal scholars note that 12 U.S.C. § 242 permits removal “for cause” but does not define the term—and historically such standards hew to misconduct in office rather than pre-appointment personal matters. No president has previously attempted to remove a sitting Fed governor, and a court fight—potentially up to the Supreme Court—appears likely. Cook’s attorney Abbe Lowell called the action unlawful; Cook says she will continue performing her duties. Market participants immediately mapped the institutional shock to a “hard assets” trade. Macro commentator Mel Mattison wrote on X that he has been “posting about a Coup d’Fed or a Fed Makeover,” adding: “Tonight definitely takes it up a notch. My initial take is that after some dropped jaws close, this will ultimately be bullish equities and massively bullish gold/btc.” In his view, “short-term, it will introduce a little vol and maybe even a percent or two off the indices this week,” but over the coming months “the board of governors may be stacked with Trump appointees who will deliver MMT-like monetary policy with a conservative twist.” He added that “other central banks, like the ECB , will be forced to lower rates as well … a race to the bottom in currencies combined with massive fiscal spending will ultimately lead to higher equity prices and gold over $5K by end of ’26,” and that new Bitcoin all-time highs by the end of the week would not surprise him “after blockbuster NVDA earnings on Wednesday and an inline PCE Friday.” Others framed the moment even more starkly. “And just like that, the President has fired a voting Fed member for the first time in history. The White House has never been this adamant about exerting influence over the US’ central bank. Fiscal dominance accelerates. Weimar beckons,” wrote Joe Consorti, Head of Growth at Bitcoin focused firm Theya, who added separately: “Accelerate Operation Weimar . Long hard assets. Relax and enjoy the ride.” MacroEdge’s Partner and Chief Economist Don Johnson underscored the policy channel: “We’re running an almost $3 trillion deficit — what do you think happens with a puppet Fed that cuts rates to 1%?” Beyond Bitcoin, cross-asset price action reflected the shock. In early trading, the dollar index eased and the Treasury curve bear-steepened on fears that the Fed’s perceived independence could erode, with investors reassessing the path for rate cuts; risk assets and gold were volatile. The attempted removal also intensified the narrative that Trump could soon gain additional seats to reshape the Board; if the action ultimately stands, it would give the White House another nomination to a seven-member body where governors (unlike regional bank presidents) always vote on monetary policy. What matters for Bitcoin from here is the policy and liquidity regime that markets start to price. A successful test of presidential removal power that leads to a more politicized, easier-money Fed would validate the “fiscal dominance” and “hard-assets” thesis Mattison and Consorti articulate, supporting BTC via real-yield compression and currency-debasement hedging flows.

MicroStrategy S&P 500 inclusion , a highly anticipated event for the largest publicly traded holder of Bitcoin, did not materialize. This unexpected snub left many on Wall Street surprised, impacting MSTR’s stock performance. Why Did MicroStrategy S&P 500 Inclusion Fail? Wall Street had high hopes for MicroStrategy (MSTR). The company, known for its significant Bitcoin holdings, met key eligibility requirements for the prestigious S&P 500 index. Many analysts and investors believed its entry was almost a certainty. However, the S&P Dow Jones Indices committee decided otherwise, much to the market’s surprise. This rejection also extended to other strong candidates like Robinhood, as Cointelegraph reported. The decision defied growing expectations. Despite MicroStrategy’s strong market presence and eligibility, the committee’s choice remained a mystery to many. This outcome highlights the complex and often opaque nature of index inclusion decisions. The Immediate Impact on MSTR Stock Following the announcement, MicroStrategy’s stock price experienced a notable decline in after-hours trading. This immediate reaction highlights the market’s disappointment. Investors often view inclusion in the S&P 500 as a significant vote of confidence, leading to increased institutional investment and liquidity. Therefore, the failure of MicroStrategy S&P 500 inclusion naturally triggered a negative sentiment. Consider these key takeaways from the immediate aftermath: Market Expectations Defied: Analysts widely predicted MSTR’s entry, leading to a strong build-up of anticipation. Eligibility Met: MicroStrategy had reportedly fulfilled the necessary criteria for consideration. Immediate Stock Reaction: MSTR shares fell significantly in after-hours trading, reflecting investor sentiment. Broader Implications: The decision impacts investor perception of Bitcoin-linked equities within traditional finance. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin and Crypto? MicroStrategy’s identity is deeply intertwined with Bitcoin. Its strategy to accumulate Bitcoin has made it a unique player in both traditional and crypto markets. While the S&P 500 decision is about a traditional stock index, it inevitably sparks conversations about the broader acceptance of crypto-exposed companies. Does this snub reflect a cautious stance towards companies heavily invested in digital assets? Or is it simply a procedural decision unrelated to its Bitcoin strategy? The answers are complex. This event serves as a crucial reminder that even established companies with strong crypto ties face hurdles in traditional financial structures. The journey for digital assets to gain full mainstream acceptance is ongoing, marked by both progress and unexpected challenges. Navigating Future MicroStrategy S&P 500 Inclusion Prospects Despite this setback, MicroStrategy’s long-term vision remains focused on its Bitcoin strategy. The company continues to be a major voice in the institutional adoption of Bitcoin. For future S&P 500 consideration, the committee looks at various factors, including: Profitability: Consistent positive earnings are crucial for sustained inclusion. Market Capitalization: Companies must meet specific minimum thresholds. Liquidity: Sufficient trading volume ensures ease of buying and selling shares. Sector Representation: The committee aims for balanced industry diversity within the index. While MicroStrategy S&P 500 inclusion did not happen this time, the company’s performance and market dynamics could change, potentially paving the way for future consideration. It’s a marathon, not a sprint, and MicroStrategy’s journey in the financial world continues to evolve. The recent decision to exclude MicroStrategy from the S&P 500 index was a significant moment for both the company and the wider crypto market. It underscored the unpredictable nature of traditional market indices, even for companies meeting apparent eligibility. While MSTR stock saw an immediate dip, its core Bitcoin strategy remains intact. This event serves as a reminder that the journey for crypto-linked entities in traditional finance can be challenging, but also full of evolving opportunities. The path to mainstream acceptance continues to unfold. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the S&P 500 index? A1: The S&P 500 is a stock market index that represents the performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States, selected by S&P Dow Jones Indices. It is widely regarded as one of the best gauges of large-cap U.S. equities and the overall stock market. Q2: Why was MicroStrategy expected to join the S&P 500? A2: MicroStrategy had met several key eligibility requirements, including market capitalization and consistent profitability. Its unique position as a major corporate holder of Bitcoin also generated significant investor interest and speculation regarding its potential inclusion. Q3: How did MicroStrategy’s stock react to the news? A3: MSTR’s stock price fell in after-hours trading immediately following the announcement that it would not be included in the S&P 500. This reaction reflected market disappointment and the potential loss of institutional investment that often accompanies index inclusion. Q4: Does this decision impact MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy? A4: The S&P 500 decision primarily affects MSTR’s status within traditional stock markets, not its core Bitcoin acquisition strategy. MicroStrategy remains committed to its Bitcoin holdings and its role as a prominent advocate for institutional Bitcoin adoption. Q5: What are the general criteria for S&P 500 inclusion? A5: The S&P 500 committee considers factors such as market capitalization, liquidity, public float, profitability (four consecutive quarters of positive GAAP earnings), and sector representation to ensure the index accurately reflects the U.S. economy.

Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score Has Turned Red For All Holders In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about the latest trend in the Accumulation Trend Score of Bitcoin for the various investor cohorts. The Accumulation Trend Score measures, as its name suggests, the degree of accumulation or distribution that BTC holders are participating in. Related Reading: 215% PENGU Rally Incoming? Analyst Says Token ‘Inches’ From Next Leg Up The indicator uses two factors to calculate the score: the balance changes happening in the wallets of the investors and the size of the wallets involved. This means that larger entities have a higher influence on the indicator. Now, here is a the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score across holder groups over the past year: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score had a value greater than 0.5 for all investor groups back in July, implying a net accumulation behavior across the cohorts. Retail (under 1 BTC), whales (1,000 to 10,000 BTC), and mega whales (above 10,000 BTC) even saw the metric assume a value close to 1 for a while, which corresponds to a near-perfect accumulation trend. Earlier this month, the market buying started to show signs of weakness and now, the behavior has flipped across the holder groups with investors taking to distribution. Fish (10 to 100 BTC) lead the selling with an Accumulation Trend Score near zero. “The uniformity across cohorts highlights broad sell-side pressure emerging in the market,” notes the analytics firm. From the chart, it’s visible that the last time this pattern developed was in January. What followed the sector-wide selloff was a bearish period for Bitcoin. As such, it now remains to be seen whether the recent shift toward distribution would also lead to something similar. Another development that could potentially signal the oncoming of a bearish phase could be BTC’s retest of the Realized Price of the 1 month to 3 months old investors, as Glassnode has explained in another X post. The Realized Price is a metric that calculates the average cost basis of Bitcoin investors. The metric shown in the above chart tracks this value specifically for the holders who purchased their coins between 1 and 3 months ago. Related Reading: When Will Bitcoin Bottom Out? This Could Be The Signal To Watch At present, the indicator is sitting at $110,800, which is around where BTC has been trading following its decline. “Historically, failure to hold above this level has often led to multi-month market weakness and potential deeper corrections,” says the analytics firm. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $109,900, down more than 5% over the last seven days.

Ethereum Price Prediction: Can it Reach $5000? The appreciation of Ethereum’s price in Q2 2025 has been phenomenal. It has risen over 80% in the past year and continues to soar. It has always been a strong project because of its strong fundamentals. Credits: CoinMarketCap Ethereum’s strongest pillar is its utility. It’s the settlement layer for smart contracts, DeFi, NFTs, and an expanding list of tokenized assets. There are a few structural factors in favor of higher prices: Persistent staking demand reduces circulating supply as more and more ETH enters long-term staking. Sustained growth in DeFi TVL and layer-2 usage. Institutional demand for ETH. A target of $5000 is not a far big deal for the world’s largest altcoin. However, in the short term, volatility must be expected. Beware of network congestion, gas dynamics, and any governance updates that can have a substantial impact on issuance or staking rewards. Why Is Avalon X the Most Promising RWA Investment in 2025? Aside from ETH , the new RWA altcoin that’s making all the investor buzz is Avalon X. It blends Grupo Avalon’s real-world progress with a utility token that has tiered experiences, staking, and scarcity mechanics. These digital benefits are backed by the authenticity of real estate. The utility of the project is future-oriented and pioneering. Avalon X wants to create a digital infrastructure where real estate investment is accessible for everyone. And so, essentially, the project is attempting to create a niche for itself in the trillion-dollar international real estate sector . In an attempt to develop a strong community and achieve viral growth, the Avalon X team is running two massive giveaways : a $1 million AVLX token giveaway divided between 10 winners, and a high-end Avalon Eco Valley townhouse giveaway. The giveaways are intended to seed the community, turn interest into referral-driven action, and speak to a narrative of real utility. Eco Valley Townhouse Giveaway In order to join these giveaways, participants need to purchase AVLX. They can also increase their chances by referring to friends. Moreover, Avalon X’s strong tokenomics make it a most probable bet in the long run. It has a fixed supply of 2 billion AVLX and also has a set burn mechanism of 7%. This makes Avalon X different from the meme coins. The tokenomics make sure that the element of scarcity is triggered in the long run, and it therefore remains profitable for the long-term investors. The project is also audited by CertiK . So, investors can be assured that they are investing their money in a safe, transparent, and utility-driven project.

Yet in the middle of the volatility, analysts have singled out three tokens that stand apart: XRP, MAGACOIN FINANCE, and Polygon. These projects combine strong community backing, institutional interest, and, in the case of MAGACOIN FINANCE, a red-hot altcoin that is turning heads across the industry. 1. XRP – Payments and Regulatory Focus Despite recent market pullbacks, XRP continues to stay in the spotlight as one of the top payment-focused cryptocurrencies. Its price action around the $2.90 level has been choppy, pressured by large-holder sell-offs and delays in ETF rulings. Still, optimism remains among analysts who see XRP’s role in cross-border finance as a long-term growth driver. If legal clarity improves, XRP could reclaim $3.00 as support and possibly set the stage for bigger moves ahead. 2. MAGACOIN FINANCE – A Presale Standout MAGACOIN FINANCE has been highlighted as the best crypto to buy this week, as it offers a unique opportunity to investors in the evolving market. While XRP battles for adoption in payments and Polygon scales Ethereum’s ecosystem, MAGACOIN FINANCE is stealing attention with its red-hot presale. The demand for MAGACOIN FINANCE is surging. Thousands of investors and renowned traders have already joined in, further boosting the price. Analysts say that if the momentum around the project sustains, it is bound to be one of the breakout altcoins of the upcoming bull cycle. Early investors can still secure their positions in the tokens and even at a discount. By using the code PATRIOT50X, buyers secure a 50% EXTRA BONUS, joining numerous other investors who have already keyed into the project. With supply fast running out, latecomers may be left chasing the rallies once the rest of the market catches on. Smart money says now is the right time to secure the right positioning in this emerging contender. 3. Polygon – Scaling Ethereum’s Future Polygon (POL) is entering a major transition, moving from MATIC to the new POL token in late August. This migration is backed by major exchanges and aims to boost liquidity while expanding ecosystem use cases. Polygon’s network has already seen strong growth in DeFi, with total value locked rising more than 40% this year. With scalability improvements and USDT deployment on the way, Polygon looks well-positioned to attract developers and investors alike. The Bottom Line While the broader crypto market faces headwinds, XRP, Polygon, and MAGACOIN FINANCE are being spotlighted as the best cryptos to buy this week. With XRP’s payments focus, Polygon’s ecosystem growth, and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale excitement, these tokens bring very different strengths. However, for smart investors planning ahead of the next bull cycle, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the hidden gem to accumulate now.

While the global crypto market cap lost 3.88% in the past day, Eclipse came under immense selling pressure. The altcoin lost more than 15% over the past 24 hours after the blockchain company announced key changes to its workforce and leadership. Eclipse Labs announced a new CEO and that it had trimmed its team by 65%. It comes as the company adopts a new direction after its token generation event (TGE). The X post read: As part of this transition, OXSydney will assume the role of CEO following the voluntary departure of OXLitquidity. To align resources with our updated strategy, we have reduced our workforce by 65%. This difficult decision was made to give Eclipse the flexibility needed to execute on its next chapter.

Going forward, we’ll prioritize building a breakout application on top of Eclipse’s L2 7:17 PM · Aug 25, 2025 410 Reply Copy link Read 354 replies The announcement came as the crypto space experienced overwhelming selling pressure. Bearish sentiments saw ES extend its daily losses by 15.65% from $0.1834 intraday peak to $0.1547. That reflected investor concerns amidst Eclipse’s restructuring. Meanwhile, the changes follow the Eclipse TGE (token generation event) and highlight Eclipse’s intent to reposition itself, focusing on enriching its L2 infrastructure with a “breakout application.” The team said: Over the past months, we’ve explored opportunities for application development on the network. Going forward, we’ll prioritize building a breakout application on top of Eclipse’s L2 infrastructure. Eclipse’s timely leadership transition Vision and leadership are paramount to remain competitive in the L2 sector. Eclipse’s move to restructure its team and appoint a new chief reflects the opportunities and challenges the ES project faces. Eclipse Labs highlighted that the new CEO replaces the previous OxLitquidity, who voluntarily departed. However, the new changes aim at aligning the company with a new trajectory post-TGE. The team emphasized prioritizing their core mission of bringing web2 apps on-chain. The ‘tough’ team reduction While leadership shake-ups tend to dominate headlines, Eclipse’s 65% workforce reduction raised eyebrows. Such drastic and massive cuts often signal internal challenges, shifting priorities among the team, and financial constraints. While the move could streamline operations with a sharper focus, the layoff’s magnitude has stirred speculations about Eclipse’s stability. ES price outlook The native token reflected community worries with notable dips on its daily chart. ES lost over 15% to intraday lows of $0.1547 before slight recoveries. The alt changes hands at $0.1598, with significant selling pressure hinting at further dips in the short term. Chart by Coinmarketcap Broad market declines contribute to ES’s weakness. However, the team emphasized that the project’s long-term mission remained intact. Eclipse Labs promises to leverage its streamlined resources and new leadership to build an advanced application that showcases the complete capabilities of its Layer 2 infrastructure.

Sellers have consistently limited the price increase to around $3.05, creating a narrowing wedge pattern as volatility diminishes. Spot inflows show a small net gain of $20.9 million on August 26, which suggests that dip buyers are carefully entering the market even though it is generally weak. What’s Happening With XRP’s Price?

He stated, “The MEGA ‘W’ Pattern is here to play out,” pointing to a structure that may be nearing confirmation. This double bottom pattern is commonly associated with trend reversals and bullish continuations. It consists of two declines with a recovery in the middle. This reflects the broader cycles of consolidation and breakouts that have characterized XRP’s history, suggesting that another major breakout is coming. #XRP – The MEGA 'W' Pattern ONLY FEW The MEGA 'W' Pattern is here to Play out What are you feeling bearish about? Let’s discuss! #XRPFamily , STAY STEADY and STRONG! Together We Rise , and soon we shall FLY HIGH! pic.twitter.com/pSK0mJQXZm — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) August 25, 2025 Chart Structure and Technical Context The chart highlights two large round bottoms of multiple years, culminating in a double-bottom style formation that has been categorized as W10 in his common “W” variations reference. Such formations often serve as bullish continuation signals when confirmed by a breakout above resistance. XRP began forming the pattern after its previous peak in 2018, but failed to close above the neckline for years. Its highest point came in April 2021 when the asset rose to $1.96 before quickly retracing due to bearish pressure from the lawsuit. The neckline of this pattern sits near $2.55, where the price has encountered significant resistance. According to the chart, XRP climbed above the neckline in January when it surged by over 500%, and its recent climb to a new all-time high has confirmed this breakout. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Target for the Current Cycle Based on the outlined structure, the present cycle highlights $3.3 as a primary upside objective. This figure corresponds with the completion of the W formation and reflects a breakout scenario. While the analyst has longer-term targets that he did not reveal in his post, the focus remains on $3.3 as a starting point for the larger price surge. For many participants in the XRP market, the recognition of a mega W pattern suggests a technical case for sustained bullish sentiment. The setup extends beyond short-term volatility and situates XRP within a multi-year technical framework. EGRAG CRYPTO reinforced this perspective with a call for patience, encouraging the community to remain steady as the structure unfolds. Now that XRP has confirmed the bullish breakout, it’s only a matter of time before it enters a price discovery phase , resuming its climb toward new heights.

He advocates BTC holders to “sell now and buy back later.” He said in a thread on X that selling now and buying back lower “beats justing riding it all the way down.” Bitcoin just dropped below $109K, down 13% from its high less than two weeks ago. Given all the hype and corporate buying, this weakness should be cause for concern. At a minimum, a decline to about $75K is in play, just below $MSTR 's average cost. Sell now and buy back lower. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) August 26, 2025 “Given all the hype and corporate buying, this weakness should be cause for concern,” he wrote. Bitcoin fell 3.12% in the past 24 hours to $109,828, underperforming the broader crypto market. The largest crypto has been down 13% from its high less than two weeks ago. BTC Could Fall Below MSTR’s Average Cost Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), the largest Bitcoin treasury firm, has been holding the token since 2020. The firm bought 3,081 BTC for $356.9 million at an average cost of $115,829 each on Monday.

According to Peter Schiff’s prediction, Bitcoin would soon witness a plunge to as low as $75,000, a mark that BTC hit in April 2025. “At a minimum, a decline to about $75K is in play, just below $MSTR’s average cost.” Bitcoin is Falling Down – Is $75K Plunge Possible? Though Bitcoin has been tumbling down, Schiff’s prediction seems remote, given other factors driving up the price, gradually. The recent flash crash is attributed to a massive whale dump that sparked major liquidations. A whale sold 24,000 BTC in a batch of transactions, proving calamitous for Ether that recently hit an all-time high . Further, Fed Chair Powell’s Jackson Hole speech emphasized labor market risks, which initially fueled a 4% BTC bounce. However, fading momentum reversed gains. Meanwhile, institutional accumulation continues with the recent Metaplanet’s 103 BTC purchase. Further, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw massive inflows ($231M) on August 14. Bitcoin’s trajectory hinges on whether ETF inflows outpace whale selloffs and if macro liquidity aligns with tech innovation.

Understanding key price levels is essential for navigating this dynamic market. Recently, a significant analysis pointed to a crucial Bitcoin support zone that could dictate its near-term future. This insight offers a vital perspective for anyone following BTC’s journey. Unpacking Crucial Bitcoin Support Levels: The Analyst’s View According to Axel Adler Jr., a respected contributor at CryptoQuant, Bitcoin has established a remarkably strong support zone. This isn’t just a random guess; it’s based on solid technical indicators. He identifies the range between $100,000 and $107,000 as particularly robust. Why is this specific range so important? Adler Jr. highlights two powerful factors converging here: Realized Price for Short-Term Holders: This metric represents the average price at which short-term investors acquired their Bitcoin. It often acts as a psychological and actual support level, as these holders might be less inclined to sell below their cost basis. 200-Day Simple Moving Average (SMA): A widely followed technical indicator, the 200-day SMA often signals long-term trends and acts as a dynamic support or resistance level. When the price hovers above it, it generally indicates bullish sentiment. The intersection of these two indicators creates a powerful confluence, making the $100K-$107K area a formidable Bitcoin support barrier. This suggests that the market sees significant value and buying interest within this range. What Happens if This Bitcoin Support Holds Strong? When a key support level like the $100,000 to $107,000 range holds firm, it often brings a wave of confidence to the market. Investors and traders watch these levels closely for signs of stability and potential upward momentum. If Bitcoin successfully defends this zone, several positive outcomes are possible: Renewed Bullish Sentiment: A bounce from strong support can signal that buyers are stepping in, potentially leading to increased demand and price appreciation. Market Confidence Boost: Stability at higher price points reassures investors, encouraging new capital to flow into the market. Foundation for Future Growth: Establishing a solid base at these levels provides a springboard for Bitcoin to potentially challenge new all-time highs in the future. Therefore, monitoring how BTC interacts with this particular Bitcoin support zone is crucial for understanding its immediate trajectory. It could be a turning point for many market participants. Navigating Potential Downturns: The Next Bitcoin Support Line While the $100K-$107K range offers significant hope, responsible analysis always considers alternative scenarios. What if, for some reason, this primary Bitcoin support level fails to hold? Axel Adler Jr. has also identified the next critical safety net for the cryptocurrency. Should the $100,000-$107,000 zone be breached, the market’s attention would quickly shift to the next key support area: between $92,000 and $93,000 . This zone would then become the new battleground for buyers and sellers. Understanding these secondary support levels is vital for risk management. For investors, this information can help in: Setting Stop-Loss Orders: Knowing potential downside levels assists in protecting capital. Identifying Accumulation Zones: For those looking to buy, a dip to a confirmed lower support could present a buying opportunity. Adjusting Portfolio Strategy: Being aware of potential shifts allows for more agile and informed decision-making. The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and having a clear roadmap of support levels helps in making sense of the price action, whether it’s moving up or down. Why Understanding Bitcoin Support Matters for Your Portfolio For both seasoned traders and new investors, comprehending where Bitcoin finds its footing is not just academic; it’s profoundly practical. This type of technical analysis, provided by experts like Axel Adler Jr., offers actionable insights that can directly influence your investment strategy. Knowing the strength of current Bitcoin support helps you anticipate market movements rather than react to them. This knowledge empowers you to: Make more informed buying and selling decisions. Manage risk effectively by identifying potential downside limits. Gain confidence in your long-term Bitcoin holdings, understanding its underlying resilience. Ultimately, a clear grasp of these critical support zones contributes to a more robust and resilient investment approach in the ever-evolving crypto landscape. It transforms speculation into a more calculated and strategic endeavor. In conclusion, the analysis pointing to a strong Bitcoin support zone between $100,000 and $107,000, bolstered by the realized price for short-term holders and the 200-day SMA, offers a beacon of stability for the world’s leading cryptocurrency. While the $92,000-$93,000 range stands as the next line of defense, the current assessment underscores the importance of these technical indicators in shaping market sentiment and price action. Staying informed about these crucial levels is paramount for anyone navigating the exciting, yet often unpredictable, journey of Bitcoin. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the primary Bitcoin support zone identified by Axel Adler Jr.? The primary Bitcoin support zone is identified between $100,000 and $107,000. Which technical indicators form this key Bitcoin support level? This crucial Bitcoin support level is formed by the intersection of the realized price for short-term holders and the 200-day simple moving average (SMA). What happens if Bitcoin falls below the $100K-$107K support? If Bitcoin fails to hold the $100K-$107K support, the next key support zone is projected to be between $92,000 and $93,000. Why is understanding Bitcoin support important for investors? Understanding Bitcoin support levels helps investors make informed decisions, manage risk, identify potential buying opportunities, and build a more resilient portfolio strategy.

The entire dog-themed meme sector slid over the past 24 hours. A combination of macroeconomic factors and technical breakdowns has been the primary driver of the current downturn. However, there’s a glimmer of hope for some of the best meme coins in the market, with numbers showing continued interest in $SHIB in particular. Despite the poor showing of dog coins at the moment, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) continues to live and breathe its ‘max gainz’ spirit. Its ongoing presale has already raised over $1.5M and shows no signs of slowing down. Doge Coins Slide, But Strong Interest Remains Dog-themed coins are down by 8.7% over the last 24 hours, with $DOGE sliding down by 6% and $SHIB by 4% during that period. Continued uncertainty in the US interest rates has contributed to the current downturn. While US Fed Chair Jerome Powell hinted at adjusting rates in September, he also acknowledged the risks presented by rising unemployment and inflation. As such, Powell said that he will let data dictate the Fed’s decision. In addition, both $DOGE and $SHIB dipped below their respective key support levels, causing a decline in two of the largest dog-themed coins in the market. There’s a silver lining, though, particularly with $SHIB. Open interest remains strong , with $SHIB perpetual contracts amounting to $19M+. Plus, $SHIB’s trading volume is up nearly 11% in the last 24 hours, indicating that traders are buying up coins at the current price point. Maxi Doge ($MAXI): Well-Positioned for Max Gains in the Current Downturn While most of the dog-themed coins are blinking red at the moment, the Maxi Doge ($MAXI) presale has been particularly strong. Maxi’s ‘max gainz’ ethos and its humorous branding have attracted a lot of attention since the ICO launched less than a month ago. It has already raised $1.5M+, and it looks like it’s well on its way to becoming one of the best presales of 2025. As a meme coin, it positions itself as the more pumped and risk-loving cousin to the much-adored Dogecoin ($DOGE). $MAXI isn’t for the weak of heart, but is better-suited for degens who go all in for maximum gains across the board: maxed squats, max leverage, max pump on the charts and in the power rack. There’s a method behind the madness to this project. With a 40% token allocation for marketing, it’s well-positioned to gain a lot of attention among degens, while its 15% for development gives it a solid foundation to keep Maxi Doge pumping beyond the presale. We also have proof that this coin is legit. $MAXI has passed Coinsult and Solidproof audits, both showing that the team has safeguards in place: no taxes, blacklisting, hidden mint function, or honeypots. Interested in the roadmap and technicals? Our ‘What is Maxi Doge?’ guide covers everything you need to know. In short, if you’re after a token with potential, $MAXI could be the coin to HODL right now. Based on our Maxi Doge price prediction , $MAXI’s value could reach as much as $0.0024 in 2025 EOY, translating to a potential 844% ROI from the current price. You can readily buy $MAXI for $0.000254 before the next price increase (due in 24 hours). This ERC-20 token is compatible with all Ethereum-supporting wallets and the ICO accepts several payment methods including stablecoins, $ETH, $BNB, and fiat. And since $MAXI is all about max gains, you can also stake to multiply your new tokens if you want. The presale is offering dynamic staking rewards, currently at an attractive 196% APY. Join the Maxi Doge presale here. It’s a Dog-Eat-Dog World Out There — Maxi Doge Doesn’t Care As some of the market’s biggest doge-themed coins are on a freefall, the good news is that there are strong outliers. Look no further than the Maxi Doge ($MAXI) presale. It’s well-insulated against market movements right now, allowing it to continue pumping and raking in the funds. With over $1.5M raised over the last four weeks, it just might be your best bet if you want a doge coin that isn’t just all bark and no bite. Disclaimer: Always do your own research.

Binance Coin price analysis gives a bullish prediction regarding ongoing market events. The coin’s value has increased to $843.9 in the past 24 hours. If investors continue buying tokens, the BNB price might see a further spike, and the next target could be its own ATH of $899.77. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $5,928.95 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB up? BNB found support, and the price moved toward $843.9, but it may find resistance around $856. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has gained up to 0.60 percent of its value if looked at from an overall view. Will BNB reach $800? Most crypto analysts, including WalletInvestor and Coincodex, are bullish on BNB. According to Binance coin price prediction, its price is expected to cross the $800 mark in 2025, which would be higher than the current Binance coin price. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2026. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on future trading expenditures with the token, which makes it a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2028, according to Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $5,928.95 by 2031.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coingecko Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, and it reached above $650 in May, while it marked a new ATH of $858.34 on July 28. Heading into August, BNB is trading at approximately $767.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,TRADING|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB|MARKET|TOKEN SALE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-26 07:30:00

One of the projects that is attracting increasing interest is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is renowned for its widening ecosystem and focus on lending and utility-driven innovation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is priced at $0.035 in presale phase 6. Investors in the project are projecting a minimum of 400% ROI when MUTM is listed in the market. Mutuum Finance has surpassed a total of $14.9 million and more than 15700 token buyers. Mutuum Finance is positioning itself in the broader DeFi market as a platform with actual real-world applications. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Phase 6 Milestone The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) 2025 presale has been a historic success, an unprecedented achievement in the project’s journey to transform the decentralized finance (DeFi) market. The token, now in Stage 6 and valued at $0.035, is reflective of growing investor confidence and strong market anticipation. Mutuum Finance seeks to define the future of decentralized finance through an innovative platform, long-term utility, and futuristic solutions for both retail and institutional users. The presale has already attracted over 15,700 token holders and secured over $14.9 million in funding, positioning the project for a robust launch and widespread adoption.

There are 10 winners of a Mutuum Finance gift of $10,000. The giveaway is a sign that the project really cares for a loyal and a long-term community. And another step towards transparency and security, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has initiated an Official Bug Bounty Program in association with CertiK. The project team is encouraging the participants to participate by providing an incentive of up to $50,000 USDT for discovering bugs in the project. The objective of the Bounty program is to discover the possible vulnerabilities of the project. There are four types of vulnerabilities that are considered in the program for grading according to their severity, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low. Dual Lending Model Mutuum Finance is on a two-lending system where customers enjoy unparalleled flexibility with Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). In the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system, lending pools can leverage smart contracts, which can be coded to determine whether they will dynamically change interest rates based on how the market condition develops. Lenders supply fixed incomes, and borrowers are protected while taking loans. P2P model avoids middlemen to put lending entities and borrowing entities in direct touch with one another. Any price-risky asset calls for such complete decentralized model with optimal user control. Forget Shiba Inu (SHIB), smart money is moving into Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a presale-stage DeFi project already accumulating more than $14.9 million with 15,700+ investors onboard. Now available for just $0.035 in Stage 6, its next phase will increase by 14.29% to $0.04, with early adopters eyeing at least a 400% ROI on listing.

Prices rise, fall, and reset — and smart investors keep an eye on what’s likely to do well in the next cycle. Lately, analysts have been highlighting MAGACOIN FINANCE, Ethereum, and Dogecoin as three of the Best Altcoins to Buy Now. Each brings something different to the table: Ethereum’s utility, Dogecoin’s community power, and MAGACOIN’s fresh momentum. Together, they show how both established coins and new projects can capture attention when the market heats up. Analysts See a Big Opportunity Ahead Crypto analysts are bursting with excitement as MAGACOIN FINANCE gets placed in the same conversation as Ethereum and Dogecoin. Predictions are that Ethereum and Dogecoin could deliver gains to their holders, but the real opportunity lies in the 25x gain analysts have forecasted for investors who buy MAGACOIN FINANCE. While Ethereum continues to strengthen its ecosystem and Dogecoin retains its meme-driven momentum, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being recognized as a rising star with breakout potential. The reason is clear. The project is an outlier, backed by a strong community and analyst coverage. Investors are closely watching this trio as they could dominate the upcoming bull run, blending blue-chip reliability with fresh upside opportunities. With momentum building, traders are preparing for the kind of explosive returns that haven’t been seen since the early 2021 cycle. Why Ethereum and Dogecoin still matter Ethereum has been around long enough to prove itself. It’s the backbone of decentralized apps and continues to attract big institutional interest, which is why it’s often called one of the Best Altcoins to Buy Now. Dogecoin, on the other hand, is driven by its massive community. Sure, the price can be volatile, but long-time holders and new wallet growth keep it relevant. These two coins remind investors that both serious utility projects and lighthearted, culture-driven tokens can thrive together. Where MAGACOIN fits in MAGACOIN FINANCE is newer on the scene but is gaining traction fast. Analysts and investors alike are noticing how its community-driven energy and unique positioning give it room to grow. While it doesn’t yet have the track record of Ethereum or Dogecoin, its rising visibility puts it firmly in the mix when people talk about the Best Altcoins to Buy Now. For many, it represents the “wild card” play that could surprise in the next bull run. The bottom line for investors Looking ahead, Ethereum provides stability, Dogecoin brings community energy, and MAGACOIN FINANCE adds fresh upside potential.

Key Takeaways: Kraken met with the SEC to discuss regulatory frameworks for its tokenized trading system. Regulators are pressing for stricter oversight of tokenized stocks, citing weak investor protections. Tokenized stock markets remain small at $360M but could reach $1.3T if adoption accelerates. A memorandum filed Monday showed SEC staff met with four representatives from Kraken’s parent company Payward, its subsidiary Kraken Securities, and two lawyers from Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP. The agenda included the framework for a tokenized trading system, regulatory requirements for its operation, and the broader benefits of asset tokenization. Kraken Pushes SEC to Tighten Oversight of Tokenized Stocks The meeting comes as traditional exchange groups and global regulators push the SEC to tighten oversight of tokenized stocks, warning that investor protections common in regulated markets are lacking. Unlike conventional equities, tokenized stocks can be traded around the clock and often fall outside the same disclosure and reporting rules. Kraken announced its tokenized stock service on May 22, allowing non-U.S. investors to trade U.S. equities 24/7. Rival platform Robinhood launched a similar product in the European Union on June 30. Kraken followed up Wednesday by expanding its tokenized stock offering to the Tron blockchain.

It’s coming. pic.twitter.com/hAbJB7FRa8 — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) August 25, 2025 The market remains small but is attracting attention. According to RWA.xyz, the total value of tokenized stocks stands at $360 million, down 11% over the past month, yet this still represents only 1.35% of the $26.5 billion in tokenized real-world assets currently onchain. Binance Research has projected the sector could reach more than $1.3 trillion if even 1% of the global equities market is tokenized. Kraken is betting on that growth. A recent survey by the exchange found that 65% of U.S. investors active in both equities and crypto believe digital assets will outperform stocks over the next decade. Tokenized Real-World Assets May Unlock $400T TradFi Market In a recent research, Web3 digital property firm Animoca Brands said that tokenization of RWAs could unlock a $400 trillion traditional finance market. Animoca researchers Andrew Ho and Ming Ruan said the global market for private credit, treasury debt, commodities, stocks, alternative funds, and bonds represents a vast runway for growth. “The estimated $400 trillion addressable TradFi market underscores the potential growth runway for RWA tokenization,” they wrote. Meanwhile, according to the 2025 Skynet RWA Security Report, the market for tokenized RWAs could grow to $16 trillion by 2030 . Tokenized U.S. Treasuries alone are projected to reach $4.2 billion this year, with short-term government bonds driving most of the activity. Institutional interest is accelerating, with major banks, asset managers, and blockchain-native firms exploring tokenization for yield and liquidity management. Skynet highlighted emerging use cases across private credit, trade finance, and money market funds, noting that regulatory frameworks in Hong Kong, Singapore, and the U.S. could further support adoption. The report also flagged key hurdles, including thin secondary market liquidity, inconsistent legal treatment across jurisdictions, and the absence of standardized risk controls.

While Bitcoin’s dominance has already slipped by 6% over the past month, analysts remain cautious, suggesting that a broader altcoin rally is unlikely in the near term. The report highlights that the present state of the crypto market reflects “a softer appetite for risk at this stage of the cycle.” Despite positive inflows into digital assets, Bitfinex notes that the pace is subdued compared with the sharp surges seen during previous all-time highs. Investors appear more careful this time around, avoiding aggressive positioning. Current Market Conditions Remain Restrained Bitfinex analysts explained that they do not expect a “rising tide lifts all boats” moment until Bitcoin ETFs attract stronger inflows again and new investment products tailored for altcoins enter the market. These products, they argue, could create “sustained, price-agnostic demand” and establish the foundation for a broader revaluation across altcoins. However, not all experts share this restrained outlook. Coinbase Institutional’s global head of research, David Duong, recently suggested that market conditions may soon tilt in favor of a full-scale altcoin season, possibly emerging as early as September. Speculation Over Next Wave of ETF Approvals Much of the industry’s focus has shifted toward the regulatory landscape for crypto ETFs. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have now been trading for over 19 months since their approval in January 2024, while spot Ether ETFs marked their first year in July 2025. The attention is now on which products the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might approve next. The SEC has recently postponed decisions on a range of applications, including a Bitcoin-Ethereum hybrid ETF from Truth Social, Solana funds proposed by 21Shares and Bitwise, and 21Shares’ Core XRP Trust. These delays have fueled debate on how quickly altcoin-focused ETFs will make it to market and what impact they might have once launched. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas has gone a step further, predicting that active crypto ETFs will expand in the coming years, even suggesting that a memecoin-only ETF product could debut as soon as 2026. While such a product might seem unconventional, he noted that the market’s appetite for experimentation makes it a realistic possibility.

While a recent pullback from its new peak above $4,900 captured headlines, there’s a resurgence in fundamental network activity, suggesting this is more than just a speculative rally. On-Chain Fundamentals Ignite Michael Nadeau of The DeFi Report noted on X that Ethereum’s network fundamentals are strengthening alongside price gains. His research shows that roughly 75% of the network’s revenue now comes from priority fees and MEV activity, a sign that demand for blockspace is climbing. Furthermore, stablecoin supply has expanded to $156 billion, a 14% improvement since the beginning of July, with USDT and USDC dominating circulation on the network. Transfer volumes are also nearing record levels, with Layer 1 (L1) processing around $6 billion in daily settlements. This intensifying network activity has coincided with growing institutional involvement in ETH. On August 25, Tom Lee’s BitMine Immersion Technologies announced it had accumulated almost 1.7 million ETH valued at more than $8 billion to become the largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency. Nonetheless, volatility remains pronounced. Yesterday, Ethereum dropped over $550 soon after hitting a new record high, wiping out more than $110 million in leveraged positions in the process. That correction came even with the backdrop of continued whale and institutional accumulation, suggesting that market sentiment remains fragile despite the continuing structural growth. Price Action, L2 Growth, and Ethereum’s Outlook At the time of this writing, ETH was changing hands at $4,445, down 5.5% in the last 24 hours but still 5.3% higher in the past seven days. By comparison, the broader crypto market has declined 0.3% in the same period, highlighting Ethereum’s relative strength. And that’s not all. The asset has climbed nearly 18% over the previous month and is 62% in the green year-over-year. Additionally, the ETH/BTC ratio sits near 0.0403, off 3.6% this week but is still trending upward from its mid-April lows of 0.024. Layer 2 (L2) networks are amplifying this momentum. Nadeau highlighted that transaction volumes across L2s are approaching record levels, with Coinbase’s Base handling nearly half of all activity in the space, followed by Arbitrum and Worldcoin. However, Ethereum’s fee-burning mechanism has yet to fully kick in, as average blob usage per block remains at four, some ways below the threshold needed to trigger significant ETH burns. Meanwhile, the Ethereum Foundation is taking steps to support sustainable growth on the network. Last week, it announced the next stage of its Trillion Dollar Security initiative, aimed at raising wallet and contract security standards. Some of the measures it intends to take include creating a public vulnerability database and promoting human-readable transaction previews to prevent blind signing, moves that should become quite important as more value flows across the network.

Up to 85% of the fund's assets could be used for staking. VanEck is also eyeing an AVAX-based ETF, signaling rising competition. Grayscale Moves to Launch Avalanche Spot ETF with Plans for More Altcoin Funds Grayscale Investments has filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to convert its Avalanche Trust into a spot ETF, continuing its efforts to expand into altcoin-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This move comes after the company successfully launched similar products based on Bitcoin and Ethereum. Grayscale first launched the Avalanche Trust in late August 2024 as a closed-end fund that exclusively invested in Avalanche (AVAX). Since then, it has expanded its focus to include a broader range of altcoins. Future Plans: Expanding the ETF Portfolio Grayscale has big plans to keep growing its ETF portfolio. The company aims to launch additional funds based on other altcoins in the near future. According to the latest S-1 filing with the SEC on August 22, 2025, the Avalanche Trust will issue and redeem shares in cash. Coinbase will act as the custodian, while BNY Mellon will manage the trust and serve as the transfer agent. In addition to its primary investment focus, Grayscale is also looking to increase the income potential of its trust. The filing mentions the possibility of generating additional returns through staking, and if approved, the fund plans to use up to 85% of its managed assets for this purpose. This new feature promises to give the trust a unique advantage in the altcoin space. Rising Competition in the AVAX ETF Market Grayscale isn’t alone in its interest in launching an AVAX-based fund. VanEck, another prominent financial firm, has also filed an application to offer a similar product.

Understanding the future trajectory of the Ethereum price prediction is vital for making informed decisions. Recent analysis suggests a significant period of volatility is on the horizon for ETH, with a potential dip preceding a strong recovery. What’s Driving the Latest Ethereum Price Prediction? According to Benjamin Cowen, the respected founder of IntoTheCryptoverse, Ethereum is likely to experience a short-term correction this September. Cowen shared his insights on his popular YouTube channel, outlining a scenario where broader market forces will influence ETH’s immediate future. This specific Ethereum price prediction hinges on a crucial factor: Bitcoin’s anticipated movement. Cowen predicts that next month, Bitcoin (BTC) will probably fall to its 20-week simple moving average (SMA). This expected decline in BTC is primarily due to the ongoing impact of soaring U.S. Treasury yields. Historically, Bitcoin’s price action often sets the tone for the altcoin market, including Ethereum. Therefore, a dip in BTC typically leads to a corresponding decline in ETH’s value in the short term. How Might Ethereum’s Price Action Navigate the September Dip? The analyst’s forecast suggests that while the September period might see a decline for ETH, it is part of a larger, cyclical market movement. Investors should understand that such corrections are not uncommon in volatile markets. Here’s what this could mean: Short-term Volatility: Expect price fluctuations and downward pressure on ETH throughout September. BTC Correlation: Monitor Bitcoin’s performance closely, as its movements will likely dictate Ethereum’s trajectory during this phase. Macroeconomic Factors: Keep an eye on U.S. Treasury yields, as their continued rise could exert further pressure on risk assets like cryptocurrencies. This period of adjustment could present opportunities for long-term holders to accumulate assets at a lower price point, aligning with the broader Ethereum price prediction for a future rally. What Could Ignite an Optimistic October Rally for ETH? Despite the predicted September correction, Cowen anticipates a strong and bullish phase for Ethereum beginning in October. This optimistic outlook suggests that the factors causing the short-term dip will eventually subside, allowing ETH to regain momentum. Several elements could contribute to this anticipated rally: Market Rebound: A potential stabilization or reversal in U.S. Treasury yields could ease pressure on risk assets. Bitcoin Recovery: If Bitcoin finds support and begins its own recovery, it will likely pull Ethereum along with it. Ecosystem Developments: Ongoing advancements and adoption within the Ethereum ecosystem, such as Layer 2 scaling solutions and DApp growth, continue to strengthen its fundamental value. This positive shift would mark a significant turnaround, making the October rally a key event for those following the Ethereum price prediction . Beyond the Forecast: Broader Implications for Ethereum’s Price Prediction While analyst predictions offer valuable insights, they are not guarantees. The cryptocurrency market remains highly dynamic and can be influenced by a myriad of unforeseen events. For investors and enthusiasts, understanding these forecasts helps in preparing for potential market shifts. It is always prudent to conduct your own research and consider a diversified investment strategy. The projected September correction and subsequent October rally highlight the cyclical nature of crypto markets. This particular Ethereum price prediction serves as a reminder to stay informed and agile in your investment approach. In conclusion, Benjamin Cowen’s analysis paints a clear picture: a challenging September for Ethereum, influenced by Bitcoin’s response to Treasury yields, followed by a promising October rally. This forecast underscores the importance of staying updated on market trends and macroeconomic indicators. While short-term corrections can be daunting, the long-term outlook for Ethereum often remains robust, driven by its foundational technology and growing utility. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Who is Benjamin Cowen? Benjamin Cowen is the founder of IntoTheCryptoverse, a popular platform known for its in-depth cryptocurrency market analysis and technical forecasts. 2. Why is a September correction predicted for ETH? Cowen predicts a September correction for ETH largely due to an anticipated fall in Bitcoin’s price to its 20-week SMA, which is influenced by rising U.S. Treasury yields. 3. What role do U.S. Treasury yields play in this Ethereum price prediction? Soaring U.S. Treasury yields can make traditional investments more attractive, leading investors to pull funds from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies, thus impacting prices. 4. What could trigger the October rally for Ethereum? The October rally could be triggered by a stabilization or reversal in U.S. Treasury yields, a recovery in Bitcoin’s price, and continued fundamental growth within the Ethereum ecosystem. 5. How reliable are such price predictions? While analyst predictions offer informed perspectives based on technical and fundamental analysis, the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile. They should be used as a guide, not a guarantee, and always combined with personal research. If you found this analysis insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

Trading volume and open interest fell, while liquidations lean toward shorts after July’s volatility spike. A new ETF filing could boost U.S.-based tokens like Stellar, expanding institutional exposure opportunities. XLM Price and Market Activity Stellar (XLM) was trading at $0.39 at the time of writing, with a 24-hour trading volume of $324 million. The token has fallen 3% daily and 4% in the past week. Over the last month, XLM has dropped 11%, even as most of the crypto market posted gains in August. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted, “Stellar $XLM still needs one more dip before the breakout to $1.” His chart suggests the token is forming an inverse head and shoulders pattern, which often appears before a trend reversal. Stellar $XLM still needs one more dip before the breakout to $1! pic.twitter.com/pIyUOqGX2B — Ali (@ali_charts) August 25, 2025 Interestingly, the pattern shows a left shoulder earlier this year, a head in May and June, and a developing right shoulder through August. Support is near $0.36, aligned with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level. A move down into this zone would complete the structure. If XLM slips below $0.36, the next level of support sits near $0.33. On the upside, the neckline is around $0.50. A confirmed breakout above this price could open targets at $0.62, $0.82, $0.94, and $1.10 based on Fibonacci projections. Indicators Show Neutral Momentum The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 44, slightly below the midpoint of 50. This suggests weaker momentum but not oversold conditions. A fall toward 30 would show heavier selling, while a push above 50 would indicate strength returning. Source: TradingView Meanwhile, the MACD reading shows the line at -0.0035 and the signal line at -0.0051, with the histogram at 0.0016. The near-zero values point to consolidation. The MACD is close to crossing upward, which would suggest fading bearish pressure if it continues. Leverage and ETF Developments Data from Coinglass shows trading volume down 10% to $465 million, while open interest is down 5% to $314 million. Liquidation data for 26 August shows $10K in short liquidations and $1K in long liquidations across Binance and Bybit. Source: Coinglass Notably, the largest recent spike came in mid-July, when millions in positions were liquidated during a surge above $0.45. Since then, liquidation levels have eased, with more pressure on short positions. Separately, a filing for the Canary American-Made Crypto ETF was reported by Eric Balchunas. The spot fund would list the US-origin tokens, such as Stellar. Balchunas noted, “Get ready for ETFs to try every combo imaginable.” The post Buy the Dip?

Webull Reopens Crypto Trading for U.S. Investors, Unlocking New Opportunities Webull will reopen access to digital asset trading for American clients starting Monday. The decision, first reported by Bloomberg on August 25, 2025, marks the return of crypto trading after a temporary pause in 2023. Webull had suspended its crypto services due to plans for an IPO in the U.S. Now, with the market evolving and user demand growing, the company is reintroducing digital asset trading, promising new opportunities for U.S. investors. Anthony Denyer, CEO of Webull’s U.S. division, highlighted that the resumption of crypto trading responds directly to increasing demand from users. He explained that launching the crypto segment in the U.S. is just the beginning of a much larger global expansion. ”With this move, we’re starting the first stage of what will be a full-scale global movement in the digital asset space,” Denyer said. Since June, Webull has already been operational in Brazil and plans to expand further in the near future. What’s New for U.S. Investors? The updated platform will offer more than 50 cryptocurrencies, including popular options like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). With over 24 million users worldwide, Webull is positioning itself as a key player in the crypto trading space.

One such crucial trend emerging in the Bitcoin ecosystem is a significant Bitcoin ownership shift . We are witnessing a fascinating dynamic where the digital asset is moving from less patient, short-term holders to steadfast, long-term investors. This fundamental change isn’t just a fleeting observation; it suggests a deeper, healthier evolution within the market, as highlighted by recent on-chain analysis. What Does the Bitcoin Ownership Shift Truly Mean? According to insightful analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Crazzyblockk, on-chain data paints a clear picture: Bitcoin is transitioning from ‘weak hands’ to ‘strong hands.’ But what do these terms really imply for the average investor? Weak Hands: These are typically short-term holders, often new to the market or prone to panic selling during price fluctuations. They react quickly to volatility, selling their assets to avoid further perceived losses. Strong Hands: In contrast, these are long-term holders with a low cost basis. They view Bitcoin as a strategic, enduring asset and are less swayed by short-term price movements. They use market dips as opportunities to accumulate more. This transfer of supply from the former to the latter is a natural, albeit sometimes turbulent, correction process. Ultimately, it helps to strengthen the overall market structure. Why Are Strong Hands Accumulating During This Bitcoin Ownership Shift ? The current market environment, characterized by Bitcoin’s price volatility, acts as a filter. It encourages short-term traders to exit, while simultaneously presenting an attractive entry or accumulation point for long-term believers. Strong-hand investors often have a deep understanding of Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition and its potential as a hedge against inflation or a store of value. Their accumulation during periods of uncertainty signals confidence. It suggests they believe the current prices are either fair or undervalued, anticipating future growth. This behavior is a hallmark of mature asset classes, where informed investors patiently build their positions. Moreover, the low cost basis mentioned by Crazzyblockk implies that these strong hands acquired their Bitcoin at earlier, often lower, price points. This gives them greater resilience against market dips, allowing them to hold through tough times without being forced to sell. Benefits of This Healthy Market Correction for Bitcoin Ownership Shift While price volatility can be unsettling, this particular Bitcoin ownership shift offers several long-term benefits for the market: Increased Stability: As more Bitcoin moves into strong hands, the market becomes less susceptible to large, panic-driven sell-offs. Long-term holders are less likely to liquidate their holdings, creating a more stable supply dynamic. Reduced Speculative Pressure: A market dominated by long-term holders tends to have less speculative froth. This can lead to more sustainable price appreciation rather than boom-and-bust cycles driven by hype. Stronger Foundation: The accumulation by conviction-based investors builds a robust foundation for Bitcoin’s future growth. It demonstrates a belief in the asset’s enduring value, attracting further institutional and retail adoption. This process isn’t just about who owns Bitcoin; it’s about the conviction behind that ownership. It’s a natural evolution towards a more mature and resilient asset class. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Bitcoin Ownership Shift Understanding this market dynamic can empower investors. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Long-Term Perspective: Consider adopting a long-term investment strategy. Focus on Bitcoin’s fundamentals rather than daily price swings. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Regularly investing a fixed amount over time, regardless of price, can help accumulate Bitcoin at a good average cost, mimicking strong-hand behavior. Stay Informed: Follow on-chain metrics and expert analyses from reputable sources to gauge market sentiment and ownership trends. Manage Risk: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Volatility remains a characteristic of the crypto market, so prudent risk management is essential. This period of redistribution is a critical phase for Bitcoin, refining its investor base and setting the stage for future growth. It’s a testament to the asset’s journey towards mainstream acceptance and stability. In conclusion, the ongoing Bitcoin ownership shift from ‘weak hands’ to ‘strong hands’ is more than just a statistical anomaly; it’s a vital sign of market maturation. This correction process, though sometimes accompanied by price volatility, ultimately fortifies Bitcoin’s foundation, paving the way for a more resilient and less speculative future. As long-term investors continue to accumulate, they signal their profound confidence in Bitcoin’s enduring value, reinforcing its position as a premier digital asset. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are ‘weak hands’ and ‘strong hands’ in Bitcoin? ‘Weak hands’ refer to short-term holders who are quick to sell during price volatility. ‘Strong hands’ are long-term investors with conviction, often accumulating during dips and holding through market fluctuations. 2. Why is Bitcoin moving from weak to strong hands now? This shift typically occurs during periods of price volatility. Short-term holders sell off, and long-term investors, who see current prices as opportunities, absorb that supply. 3. How does this ownership shift impact Bitcoin’s price? While it can contribute to short-term volatility as weak hands sell, in the long run, it often leads to greater price stability and a stronger foundation for future appreciation, as more Bitcoin is held by conviction-based investors. 4. Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? This article highlights a market dynamic, not specific investment advice. However, the accumulation by ‘strong hands’ suggests a belief in long-term value. Always conduct your own research and consider your risk tolerance. 5. What are the long-term implications of this trend? The long-term implications include increased market stability, reduced speculative pressure, and a more robust foundation for Bitcoin’s growth and broader adoption, as the asset matures.

Tether’s Regulatory Challenges And Rising Rivals With the stablecoin market growing from $120 billion in October 2023 to $288 billion as of August, Tether’s USDT continues to hold its position as the largest stablecoin. However, the Motley Fool team has identified three emerging contenders that are poised to disrupt the company’s dominance and present significant competition. Tether commands nearly 60% of the stablecoin market, but it has not been without controversy. In 2021, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) fined Tether $41 million for “misleading claims” regarding its reserves, which were allegedly not fully backed by US dollars. Furthermore, Tether’s current reporting practices do not align with the requirements set forth by the recently passed GENIUS Act, which mandates stablecoin issuers to publish monthly disclosures about their reserves. Notably, the stablecoin issuer only provides these reports on a quarterly basis, potentially opening the door for competitors to capture some of its market share, at least in the United States. Related Reading: Can Ethereum Really Hit $20,000 This Cycle? Analyst Maps The Path Among the most prominent challengers highlighted is USD Coin (USDC), which boasts a market capitalization of approximately $68 billion. Like Tether, USDC is a fiat-backed stablecoin; however, it has not faced any legal scrutiny regarding its reserves. The issuer, Circle, has consistently published monthly attestations since USDC’s inception in 2018. The Motley Tool team asserts that this commitment positions USDC as Tether’s primary competitor, especially as regulatory compliance becomes increasingly crucial. The competitive landscape is further complicated by regulatory developments in Europe. Under the European Union’s Market in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), stablecoin issuers must obtain regulatory approval and meet strict reserve requirements. Circle has already achieved compliance with both USDC and its Euro stablecoin, EURC, while Tether has opted to withdraw from the European market entirely. A New Contender With Ties To XRP Another contender is Dai, now rebranded as USDS, which differentiates itself by adhering to the principles of decentralization. Unlike Tether and USDC, Dai is managed by Sky, previously known as MakerDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization. This structure allows anyone holding SKY governance tokens to participate in decision-making processes concerning Dai. Rather than being backed by fiat reserves, Dai is a crypto-backed stablecoin, relying on overcollateralized crypto loans. Lastly, Ripple USD (RUSD) enters the fray as a smaller player with a market cap of around $667 million. Despite its size, the Motley Fool asserts that RUSD’s connection to XRP makes it a formidable competitor. Related Reading: Dogecoin Stalls Near $0.22: Analysts Say a Major Breakout Pattern Could Be Forming Ripple, the company behind XRP, has launched RUSD as part of its payment solutions for financial institutions, focusing on efficient cross-border transactions. Additionally, RUSD has received regulatory approval from the New York State Department of Financial Services, which adds a layer of credibility and could help it gain traction in the market. Despite the potential threat, Tether’s figures far surpass those of these three challengers. This suggests that the firm’s reign in the stablecoin market may continue for some time. One thing is certain, though: stablecoins are making a notable entrance into the broader financial landscape.

While price surges are nothing new in this volatile space, the latest move higher is being fueled less by halving cycles and tech upgrades, and more by politics and global diplomacy. With President Trump’s administration embracing digital assets and peace negotiations pointing toward de-escalation, many investors see a powerful set of catalysts pushing crypto into a new phase. This environment has also brought fresh attention to emerging opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which analysts are positioning as a strong contender for the next altcoin season. The Trump Bump and Pro-Crypto Policies Donald Trump’s return to the White House has been a major turning point for digital assets. Once a critic, he now positions crypto as central to his economic agenda, vowing to make the U.S. “the crypto capital of the planet.” His administration has already appointed pro-crypto regulators at key agencies and introduced the idea of a national Bitcoin reserve, moves that have instilled confidence in both retail and institutional investors. Bitcoin’s price has surged in response, climbing alongside Ethereum as liquidity flows back into the sector. The new regulatory direction has eased fears of a crackdown, replacing uncertainty with clarity that capital markets have been waiting for. XRP’s Revival Through Policy Shifts While Bitcoin and Ethereum benefit from broader bullish sentiment, XRP has its own unique driver. The long-standing SEC lawsuit against Ripple, once a dark cloud, now appears close to resolution under the pro-crypto stance of the new administration. Market speculation that XRP could even be part of the proposed U.S. strategic reserve has only fueled more excitement. If this happens, it would mark a landmark recognition for the token and potentially unlock new avenues for institutional adoption. The Best Altcoin to Watch in 2025 Amid these shifts, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly capturing investor attention as one of the most promising altcoins heading into 2025. Its explosive growth projections, rapid community expansion, and successful fundraising rounds have put it firmly on the radar. Early buyers are already positioning themselves ahead of broader adoption, with many pointing to its potential to deliver altseason-level returns where a few thousand dollars could multiply dramatically . With strong momentum, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being discussed in the same breath as some of the legendary early-stage crypto opportunities . And this might be just the beginning. Peace Talks and Market Optimism Beyond U.S. policy, ongoing peace negotiations in Eastern Europe could also prove to be a tailwind for risk assets. A credible peace deal would likely bring down energy prices, ease inflation, and encourage central banks to cut rates sooner rather than later. That kind of macro backdrop typically sends investors back into growth and risk-on markets—crypto included. For Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP, such a scenario would strengthen the case for another leg higher. Conclusion: A Perfect Storm of Catalysts The rally in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP is being shaped by far more than technical patterns or halving events. It’s the combination of Trump’s pro-crypto agenda and the possibility of global stability through peace talks that is creating a perfect storm. With a friendlier regulatory environment, institutional capital flowing in, and geopolitical tensions showing signs of easing, conditions are lining up for sustained growth. For those looking beyond the majors, the explosive growth potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE could make it one of the biggest winners of the 2025 altcoin season.

The new Dogecoin Trust ETF is established with the ticker symbol of $GDOG and will be listed on NYSE Arca and is awaiting approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This submission follows Grayscale’s earlier February 13 filing using Form 19b-4. While the filing has temporarily lifted Dogecoin’s price by 2.5% to 6%, DOGE has since faced notable volatility, falling 4.17% to $0.2238 in the last 24 hours. Its market capitalization declined to $33.71 billion; on its day, trading volume shot up $3.14 billion. With no supply cap and a circulating total of 150.57 billion coins, the token remains susceptible to broader market downturns. At the same time, traders and investors within the meme coin community appear to be redirecting attention—and capital—toward Little Pepe (LILPEPE), a new meme-inspired token projected by proponents to deliver gains of up to 18,365%. Institutional Entry Versus Community Momentum The ETF filing by Grayscale is considered one move to get more investors to Dogecoin with the help of institutional investors, as it might help to improve the liquidity and settle the DOGE into more institutional portfolios. Approval would mark one of the first such listings for a meme cryptocurrency and may shape the regulatory path for other altcoin ETFs awaiting decisions, including products from 21Shares. Nonetheless, the ETF’s outcome is uncertain. The SEC has historically pushed back against similar proposals, citing concerns related to volatility and market manipulation. The month of October 2025 will mark a turning point in regulatory clarity. Until that time, Dogecoin could be experiencing a lengthy process of price consolidation, although speculative price analysis projects that prospective prices may be as high as $0.40 or even $0.50 should institutional adoption continue. In the meantime, retail traders continue to buy and sell LILPEPE during the presale, with a current raised amount of 98.06% of the $22.32 million goal of Stage 11 and almost 14.06 billion tokens sold at a price of $0.0020 per token. The specific niche of the token as a Layer-2 chain optimized only towards meme coins is making it something of extreme popularity, unlike general-purpose ones. The LILPEPE Technical Model and Early Demand Drivers Little Pepe has architecture with several properties rare in meme coin architecture. These are a 0% transaction tax model, a mitigation against sniper bots, and a verified CertiK audit score of 95.49 percent. The project further has CEX listings on two of the largest exchanges, awaiting a launch, which are also expected to be used to increase early liquidity and price discovery. Given that more than $21.96 million has been raised already, investor confidence seems to be informed by the fact that the token will provide the default environment through which meme coins will be launched. The mechanism of staking and reward programs (considering 13.5 percent of the entire supply) is another incentive to long-term holding. Viral content and influencer cooperation-based promotional strategies will likely also become an important part of the post-launch growth. With Grayscale already making strides towards mainstreaming DOGE in ETF form, the blistering pace of the LILPEPE presale stands out as a signal of how a community-based discourse and the attributes of project utility will become defining elements of meme coin activity in a digital asset ecosystem.

The proposed ETF, which will trade under the ticker symbol $GDOG, aims to offer a more formal investment vehicle for the meme coin on NYSE Arca. This application, made in February using Form 19b-4, marks an interesting point in the lifecycle of meme-themed cryptocurrencies. The move by Grayscale has stirred the market, reflecting in a price surge for Dogecoin, although the coin continues to experience significant fluctuations. Notably, Dogecoin's price jumped between 2.5% and 6% upon the news of the filing but has since seen a decline, emphasizing the volatile nature of meme coins. Despite the ups and downs, the enthusiasm around Dogecoin and its peer cryptocurrencies, like Little Pepe (LILPEPE), suggests a vibrant community interest. The Potential Impact of a Dogecoin ETF on the Market Should the SEC greenlight the Dogecoin ETF, it could set a precedent for other meme coins, altering the landscape for similar assets in the institutional arena. This approval could enhance Dogecoin's liquidity and integration into more diversified portfolios, potentially stabilizing its market presence. However, the SEC's decision remains uncertain due to concerns about the inherent volatility and risks of market manipulation associated with such assets. Emerging Competitors: The Rise of Little Pepe Amidst this institutional development, the meme coin community is seeing dynamic shifts, with significant capital moving towards emerging tokens like LILPEPE. This new meme-inspired token is gaining traction, backed by a robust presale performance, raising nearly 98.06% of its $22.32 million goal in Stage 11 of its offering. LILPEPE's unique appeal stems from its targeted architectural design for meme coins, boasting features like zero transaction tax and protections against sniper bots. Additionally, its early adoption signals, including a high CertiK audit score and impending major exchange listings, position it for potential rapid growth post-launch. The scenario featuring Grayscale's push for a Dogecoin ETF juxtaposed with the meteoric presale of LILPEPE illustrates a broader trend: while institutional interests attempt to formalize the meme coin sector, the community-led initiatives continue to drive innovation and excitement in this unique crypto niche. Final Thoughts The crypto landscape is witnessing an interesting dichotomy with Grayscale's institutional approach to Dogecoin and the community-driven enthusiasm for tokens like LILPEPE. This dynamic hints at a persisting evolution of the meme coin market, shaped by both formal financial structures and grassroots movements.

Trump, who has frequently pressured the FED and FED Chairman Jerome Powell on this issue and called for their resignation, showed how serious he is about interest rate cuts with his latest move. Accordingly, Trump announced in a post on his Truth Social account that he had dismissed FED member Lisa Cook, whose resignation he had recently called for. Trump stated that the US Constitution and the Fed law allow and authorize the removal of a board member if there is cause. At this point, Trump stated that he had sufficient reason to dismiss Lisa Cook on the grounds that she made false statements in mortgage agreements. “By virtue of the authority granted by Article II of the United States Constitution and the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 (with amendments), you are hereby removed from your position on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, effective immediately. The Federal Reserve Act provides that you may be removed from office for cause at my discretion. (See 12 USC § 242). I have determined that there is sufficient cause for your removal.” Lisa Cook, appointed by former President Joe Biden, responded with a harsh statement after Trump claimed he fired her: Cook stated that President Trump “does not have the authority” to remove him from office. “President Trump acted as if he fired me for cause, even though there was no legal justification for doing so and he had no authority to do so. I will not resign and will continue to work to support the US economy, as I have done since 2022. I will continue to do my job.” Trump's dismissal of Fed member Lisa Cook was a first in US history. Experts stated that Cook's removal would give Trump a majority at the Fed, allowing him to easily lower interest rates. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: A First in US History!

According to a memorandum published by the SEC, several members of the agency’s staff met with four representatives from Kraken’s parent company, Payward Inc., and its affiliated brokerage arm, Kraken Securities LLC. Two legal advisors from Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP also attended, which means the meeting extended beyond just technical implementation and dove into regulatory interpretations. Why did the SEC meet Kraken? The meeting focused on Kraken’s proposed tokenized trading system and the broader framework necessary to operate such a platform under US securities law. SEC memorandum. Source: SEC. Further, SEC and Kraken also explored the potential benefits of tokenisation, a topic gaining traction as more financial firms test blockchain-based models for asset issuance and trading. Lately, the agency has been under a lot of pressure to address the risks and rewards of tokenised equities, which has drawn platforms like Kraken into formal talks on the next steps. Several traditional financial associations have called on the SEC to tighten oversight of these digital products, citing the absence of investor protections typically found in conventional markets. Tokenised equities — which can be traded 24/7 — often bypass many of the restrictions that apply to their traditional counterparts. Kraken remains one of the few major crypto exchanges actively offering tokenised stocks. Back in May, the company introduced a service enabling non-US users to trade blockchain-based versions of popular US equities around the clock. Since then, Kraken has expanded that offering across multiple networks. For instance, on August 20, Kraken revealed that it would integrate its tokenised stocks — known as xStocks — with the Tron blockchain. The move was part of a broader collaboration with tokenisation infrastructure provider Backed and the TRON DAO and allowed users to deposit and withdraw tokenised stocks like Apple and Tesla directly on Tron as TRC-20 tokens. The market still has room to grow As of press time, the market for tokenised stocks remains relatively small compared to the broader tokenised asset ecosystem. If we look at data from RWA.xyz, the total value of tokenised equities in circulation stands at just $360 million, which marks a drop of 11% over the past 30 days. That’s a mere 1.35% of the $26.5 billion in real-world assets currently hosted on public blockchains. Yet, that hasn’t stopped firms from doubling down on the opportunity, as they seek to lead what could become one of the most active blockchain-based financial markets. Robinhood, for instance, began offering tokenised versions of US equities to users in the European Union on June 30, tapping into round-the-clock trading demand in a region with lighter regulatory friction. Coinbase is also moving in, but with a different strategy. The exchange has gone after formal regulatory approval to launch tokenised equities in the US, making it a “huge priority” under the current SEC administration. While it has yet to confirm a formal filing, the company is reportedly pursuing a no-action letter, a key prerequisite for launching the product without triggering enforcement action.

On Monday, Argentina’s international dollar bonds sank to multi-month lows, with the 2038 sovereign note dropping 2.4 cents to 67.37 cents on the dollar, its weakest level in more than four months, according to LSEG data. The 2041 issue fell nearly 3 cents. The country’s stock market benchmark, the Merval index (.MERV), slid 4% following a 3.8% decline the previous week. The peso also weakened by almost 3% against the US dollar to 1,356 per greenback. Inflation is still below 2% since Cryptopolitan reported the drop in July. Foreign exchange markets during Tuesday’s early Asian trading hours took the official US dollar against the Argentine peso to a 1,358.977 rate, little changed from the previous session. The peso has lost 5.02% against the dollar over the past four weeks, but gained 43.24% in the past year. Argentina politician faces allegations of bribery within disability agency According to media reports cited by Reuters, there have been several allegations of corruption involving Diego Spagnuolo, the former head of Argentina’s disability agency. Local outlets last week released audio recordings in which a voice resembling Spagnuolo’s can be heard discussing bribery inside the agency. In the recordings, Spagnuolo alluded to Karina Milei, the president’s sister and chief of staff, as receiving illicit payments. He reportedly complained that he had informed the president about the misconduct but that “they didn’t fix anything.” Authorities raided several properties on Friday, including Spagnuolo’s residence, seizing mobile phones and a cash-counting machine. Media said the search was part of a much larger criminal probe within the government department. Spagnuolo was dismissed from his post after the revelations, although the authenticity of the audio has not been verified. Cabinet chief Guillermo Francos said President Milei told him Spagnuolo had never raised bribery allegations directly to his office. Milei dismisses claims as political attacks President Milei has so far avoided making any direct comments to the scandal , even though many were waiting for his input during a speech on Monday. The 54-year-old Argentine head of state instead coined the reports as attempts by opposition groups to damage his administration before the October midterms. Opposition legislators demanded that health officials overseeing the disability agency testify before Congress. Marcelo Garcia, director for the Americas at risk consultancy Horizon Engage, said investors fear the scandal could weaken Milei’s ability to deliver reforms. “It affects the government’s capacity to be reputable enough to continue to introduce tough reform in the next two years,” Garcia surmised. He added the allegations are matters of substance because they touch on social programs, and without admission or action, Milei shows he “doesn’t care for the weak and the poor.” Lawmakers faced a setback last week after failing to overturn a presidential veto on disability aid. They could use the October elections to push for a referendum on Milei’s market reforms and budget cuts. Market turbulence, corruption investigations, and economic weakness has left investors uneasy. Analysts believe Milei’s combative political style, which had previously pulled Argentina out of years of recession, are going to risk taking it back down if scandals erode his popular support. “The Milei political strategy of continued confrontation with everyone requires him to be very popular,” Garcia explained. “Any scandal that chips away at that popularity complicates his economic agenda.” Sign up to Bybit and start trading with $30,050 in welcome gifts",Economy|ARS,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|BUSINESS|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-26 09:09:05

While crypto enthusiasts often focus on digital asset-specific news, understanding the broader macroeconomic landscape, particularly significant currency movements , is paramount. The recent Dollar rebound , occurring amidst a period of notable Euro weakness , highlights how interconnected global finance remains. These traditional market shifts can influence investor sentiment, capital flows, and even the perceived stability of fiat currencies against which many digital assets are traded. Let us delve into the underlying factors driving these critical currency dynamics and explore their wider implications for the global financial ecosystem. What’s Driving the Dollar Rebound? The United States Dollar recently demonstrated a significant resurgence, clawing back earlier losses and asserting its position in the global currency hierarchy. This Dollar rebound is not an isolated event but rather a confluence of several influential factors that reinforce its status as a safe-haven asset and a barometer of global economic health. Investors often flock to the Dollar during periods of global uncertainty, seeking its stability and liquidity. Key Drivers Behind the Dollar’s Strength: Economic Resilience: Recent economic data from the United States has often exceeded expectations, showcasing a robust labor market and consumer spending. This strength contrasts with slower growth observed in other major economies, making the US a more attractive investment destination. Interest Rate Differentials: The Federal Reserve’s stance on monetary policy, particularly its interest rate trajectory, plays a pivotal role. Higher interest rates in the US compared to other developed nations can attract capital inflows, increasing demand for the Dollar. The prospect of the Fed maintaining a ‘higher for longer’ rate policy, or at least delaying cuts, provides a strong tailwind for the greenback. Safe-Haven Demand: Geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainties elsewhere in the world frequently lead investors to seek refuge in the Dollar. Its deep liquidity and perceived stability make it a preferred choice during times of market stress. Technical Factors: Beyond fundamental drivers, technical analysis often reveals support levels and buying interest for the Dollar, contributing to its upward momentum after periods of consolidation or decline. These elements collectively paint a picture of a Dollar gaining traction, reflecting both its intrinsic economic strengths and its role as a global reserve currency. The strength of the Dollar impacts everything from commodity prices to corporate earnings, making its movements a central focus for analysts and investors worldwide. Why is the Euro Experiencing Significant Euro Weakness? While the Dollar has found its footing, the Euro has faced considerable headwinds, leading to pronounced Euro weakness against its major counterparts. This decline is not solely a reflection of Dollar strength but also stems from specific challenges within the Eurozone, particularly the unfolding political landscape in France. The single currency’s performance is intrinsically linked to the economic and political stability of its member states, and any significant tremor in a core economy like France can send ripples throughout the entire bloc. Factors Contributing to Euro’s Decline: Political Uncertainty in France: The primary catalyst for recent Euro weakness has been the snap parliamentary elections called in France. This unexpected political maneuver has introduced a high degree of unpredictability regarding future government policy and fiscal stability. Economic Growth Concerns: The Eurozone economy has been grappling with subdued growth, high inflation, and the lingering effects of energy price shocks. Persistent inflationary pressures, coupled with slow growth, present a challenging environment for the European Central Bank (ECB) to navigate. Monetary Policy Divergence: While the ECB has begun to consider rate cuts, the pace and extent of these cuts relative to other central banks, especially the Federal Reserve, can influence currency valuations. A more dovish stance from the ECB compared to a hawkish Fed can widen interest rate differentials, making the Euro less attractive. Geopolitical Risks: Ongoing geopolitical conflicts and their economic repercussions, particularly concerning energy supply and trade, continue to weigh on the Eurozone’s economic outlook and investor confidence. The combination of these factors creates a challenging environment for the Euro, making it susceptible to downward pressure. Understanding these drivers is crucial for anyone trading or investing in assets denominated in or influenced by the Euro. How is French Uncertainty Impacting Global Markets? The recent political developments in France have become a significant source of French uncertainty , casting a shadow not only over the Eurozone but also influencing broader global financial markets. The decision by President Emmanuel Macron to call snap parliamentary elections following a strong showing by the far-right in European Parliament elections has introduced a period of heightened political risk. This uncertainty is particularly potent given France’s central role as the Eurozone’s second-largest economy and a key player in European integration. Implications of French Political Volatility: Aspect Impact on Markets Description Fiscal Policy Increased bond yields, wider spreads Concerns about potential populist policies leading to higher government spending and increased national debt. This raises questions about France’s ability to meet EU fiscal rules. European Union Cohesion Pressure on Euro, investor jitters A shift towards more nationalistic or anti-EU policies in France could destabilize the political cohesion of the European Union, impacting its future direction and stability. Economic Reforms Stalled progress, reduced investment Uncertainty about the government’s ability to implement necessary economic reforms could deter foreign investment and hinder economic growth prospects. Banking Sector Stock market volatility French banks, with their significant holdings of government bonds, face potential pressure if bond yields rise sharply and persistently. The market’s reaction to French uncertainty has been swift, with a sell-off in French government bonds and equities, and a noticeable weakening of the Euro. Investors are reassessing the risk premium associated with French assets, which in turn affects the broader Eurozone’s perceived stability. This situation underscores how domestic political events in a major economy can have far-reaching international consequences. Navigating the Volatile Forex Market: What Does This Mean for Investors? The current environment, characterized by a strengthening Dollar and a struggling Euro, creates a highly dynamic and potentially volatile Forex market . For investors, this period demands careful observation and strategic positioning. Understanding the interplay between these major currencies is not just for currency traders; it has implications for equity markets, commodity prices, and even the relative attractiveness of digital assets. Key Considerations for the Forex Market: Dollar’s Dominance: A stronger Dollar can make US-denominated assets more appealing, but it can also make US exports more expensive and impact the earnings of multinational corporations. For crypto, a strong Dollar can sometimes draw capital away from riskier assets, including digital currencies, as investors seek perceived safety. Euro’s Vulnerability: The Euro’s weakness presents challenges for Eurozone businesses, particularly those reliant on imports. However, it can also boost exports, making Eurozone goods more competitive internationally. The political premium on Eurozone assets may persist until clarity emerges from France. Carry Trade Opportunities: Diverging interest rate policies between central banks can create opportunities for carry trades, where investors borrow in low-interest-rate currencies and invest in high-interest-rate currencies. Impact on Commodities: Many global commodities, such as oil and gold, are priced in US Dollars. A stronger Dollar can make these commodities more expensive for buyers using other currencies, potentially dampening demand. The Forex market is a complex ecosystem where economic fundamentals, monetary policy, and geopolitical events constantly interact. Keeping a close watch on these drivers is essential for making informed decisions across various investment portfolios. Understanding Broader Currency Movements and Their Global Impact The current dynamics between the Dollar and the Euro are part of broader currency movements that resonate across the global economy. These shifts are not confined to a single pair but reflect a complex web of international trade, investment flows, and macroeconomic policies. The relative strength or weakness of major currencies has profound implications for global trade balances, inflation, and the overall financial stability of nations. Wider Repercussions of Current Currency Trends: Inflationary Pressures: For countries with weakening currencies, imports become more expensive, contributing to domestic inflation. Conversely, a strengthening currency can help dampen imported inflation. Trade Competitiveness: A weaker currency can boost a nation’s export competitiveness, making its goods and services cheaper on the global market. A strong currency can have the opposite effect, making exports more expensive. Corporate Earnings: Multinational corporations often see their earnings impacted by currency fluctuations. A strong home currency can reduce the value of foreign earnings when repatriated, while a weak home currency can boost them. Central Bank Policy: Central banks closely monitor currency movements as they can influence inflation targets and economic growth. Significant currency shifts can prompt central banks to adjust monetary policy to maintain stability. Capital Flows: Differential interest rates and economic outlooks drive capital flows across borders, directly impacting currency valuations. Regions with higher perceived returns or stability tend to attract more investment, strengthening their currency. These currency movements are not merely abstract numbers on a screen; they represent tangible economic forces that influence daily life, from the cost of goods to the profitability of businesses. For cryptocurrency investors, understanding these macro shifts is vital as they can indirectly affect market liquidity, risk appetite, and the broader financial environment in which digital assets operate. Actionable Insights for Investors: Navigating the Shifting Tides In a world where the Dollar is rebounding and the Euro is facing significant headwinds from French uncertainty , investors need a clear strategy. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Diversify Portfolios: Given the volatility, maintaining a diversified portfolio across different asset classes and geographies can mitigate risks. Consider exposure to various currencies, not just USD and EUR. Monitor Central Bank Communications: Pay close attention to statements from the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. Their guidance on interest rates and economic outlooks will continue to be primary drivers of currency movements. Assess Political Risk: Keep an eye on political developments, especially in major economies like France. Political stability is a critical factor influencing investor confidence and currency strength. Consider Hedging Strategies: For businesses or investors with significant exposure to the Euro, consider hedging strategies to protect against further downside risk. Evaluate US Economic Data: Continue to monitor US inflation, employment figures, and GDP growth. Strong data will likely reinforce the Dollar’s position. Impact on Crypto: While not directly correlated, a strong Dollar can sometimes signal a ‘risk-off’ environment, potentially leading investors to reduce exposure to more speculative assets like cryptocurrencies. Conversely, a stable or weakening Dollar could free up capital for digital assets. These insights provide a framework for navigating the current global financial landscape, allowing investors to make more informed decisions in response to ongoing currency movements . Challenges and Risks: What Could Reverse These Trends? While the current trends of Dollar rebound and Euro weakness appear established, the global financial landscape is constantly evolving. Several factors could emerge or intensify, potentially reversing these trajectories and introducing new challenges for the Forex market . Potential Reversal Triggers: Unexpected US Economic Weakness: A sudden downturn in US economic data, such as a sharp rise in unemployment or a significant slowdown in GDP growth, could diminish the Dollar’s appeal and prompt the Federal Reserve to adopt a more dovish stance, weakening the currency. Resolution of French Uncertainty: A clear and market-friendly outcome to the French elections, or a demonstration of political stability, could quickly alleviate pressure on the Euro and trigger a rebound. Shift in ECB Policy: If the European Central Bank adopts a more hawkish stance than anticipated, or if Eurozone inflation proves more persistent, it could lead to higher interest rates and support the Euro. Global Risk Appetite: A sustained improvement in global risk appetite, perhaps driven by a de-escalation of geopolitical tensions or a synchronized global economic recovery, could reduce safe-haven demand for the Dollar. Intervention from Central Banks: While rare, coordinated or unilateral central bank interventions to manage extreme currency fluctuations could significantly alter market dynamics. Investors must remain vigilant and adaptable, as these potential shifts could rapidly alter the prevailing trends and create new opportunities or risks within the Forex market . The interplay of economic, political, and monetary policy factors will continue to dictate the direction of major currency pairs. Compelling Summary: Navigating a Shifting Global Currency Landscape The global financial arena is currently witnessing a significant Dollar rebound , asserting its strength after earlier dips, primarily driven by robust US economic data and its enduring safe-haven appeal. In stark contrast, the Euro is experiencing pronounced Euro weakness , largely exacerbated by escalating French uncertainty stemming from snap elections and the potential for a populist government. These developments are creating substantial volatility within the Forex market , influencing everything from bond yields to commodity prices and impacting investor sentiment globally. Understanding these intricate currency movements is paramount for investors navigating the current economic climate. While the Dollar benefits from its perceived stability and the Federal Reserve’s cautious stance, the Euro struggles under the weight of political instability in a core member state. The implications are far-reaching, affecting trade balances, inflationary pressures, and the broader risk appetite that can indirectly influence digital asset markets. Vigilance, diversification, and a keen eye on central bank policies and geopolitical shifts are essential for making informed decisions in this evolving financial landscape. The coming weeks will be crucial in determining whether these trends consolidate or if new developments trigger a reversal, underscoring the dynamic nature of global finance.

While long-term bullish projections linger, experts are spotlighting one ETH-based token with real upside potential, Remittix (RTX) . As traditional DeFi frays under pressure, RTX stands out with platform-ready products, deep remittance integration and investor momentum. Ethereum Price Slump Reflects Macro Uncertainty Ethereum Price recently dropped approximately $400, attributable to renewed rate hike fears following comments by Federal Reserve officials. This pullback places ETH near $4,700, just above a key support zone that has drawn interest from buyers tethered to long-term bullish forecasts. Still, technicals and on-chain data currently deliver mixed signals, bearish volume hints at a pullback, yet institutional demand, especially ETF inflows, suggests underlying strength.

CryptoQuant data shows heavy net outflows; holders are moving LINK off exchanges at scale. Chainlink partners with SBI Group as analysts predict a breakout after a painful price dip. Exchange Supply Hits Lowest Level on Record Chainlink’s native token, LINK, has seen a steady decline in its exchange-held supply, according to on-chain data shared by crypto analyst Wimar.X. Throughout August, data shows a steady decline, with a sharp fall recorded between August 10 and 11. The shift suggests more holders are moving tokens off exchanges, reducing the available supply for trading. BREAKING: $LINK SUPPLY ON EXCHANGES HITS A NEW ALL-TIME LOW CHAINLINK WILL BE THE SECOND BIG ALT AFTER ETHEREUM BULLISH pic.twitter.com/MrEYWBuSIl — Wimar.X (@DefiWimar) August 25, 2025 A lower exchange balance often means less selling pressure. LINK moved from around $16 to over $25 during the same period. This price pump came alongside heavy outflows, which often reflect a shift toward long-term holding or use in staking. In addition, CryptoQuant data shows the latest netflow at approximately -239K LINK. This figure means more LINK left exchanges than entered. That kind of activity often reflects accumulation. Source: CryptoQuant Between August 1 and 7, LINK saw strong outflows, including a single-day withdrawal of over one million tokens. From August 10 to 21, this trend reversed with inflows returning, likely from profit-taking as the price reached $26. In the final week, the direction flipped again. The outflows suggest LINK is once again being moved off exchanges. Short-Term Price Pullback in Focus LINK was trading around $23 at press time. It is down over 9% in the last 24 hours and nearly 5% over the past week. The drop follows a broader pullback across the crypto market. CryptoWZRD noted that LINK “closed strongly bearish as LINKBTC declined,” but added that the token is still holding support near $23. The post warned that “moving below it will offer a short,” pointing to this level as a key area to watch. Moreover, a long-term chart shared by Ali Martinez shows LINK forming a symmetrical triangle. The asset is now testing the top of that pattern. The setup suggests one more move down toward $22–$24, followed by a potential breakout to the upside. Fibonacci projections on the chart mark the next targets at $31, then $52, and finally $98. Martinez said, “Chainlink $LINK: One more dip before $100,” suggesting the breakout could follow soon if current levels hold.

50700944,https://timestabloid.com/?p=80211,1756200141,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,MAGACOIN FINANCE Review — 5 Reasons It’s Not a Scam and Could Outperform Ethereum,https://timestabloid.com/magacoin-finance-review-5-reasons-its-not-a-scam/,"As new crypto presales continue to flood the market, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as one of the most discussed and debated tokens of 2025. With over $13 million already raised and a growing community of more than 25,000 members, this presale has captured the attention of both retail and whale investors. But with visibility comes skepticism — and some are questioning whether MAGACOIN FINANCE is a legitimate opportunity or just another high-risk gamble. In this unbiased review, we break down five critical reasons why MAGACOIN FINANCE stands apart from typical scam projects — and why some analysts believe it could even outperform Ethereum in the upcoming cycle. 1. Audited and Transparent Development Process Security is often the first red flag for potential crypto scams. MAGACOIN FINANCE has already completed a full audit by Hashex.org, a reputable blockchain security firm known for its rigorous smart contract testing. In addition to that, the team has confirmed an ongoing audit process with CertiK — a gold standard in Web3 auditing. These layers of accountability help reduce risk for early investors and signal a serious commitment to safety and legitimacy. 2. Massive Community Growth and Early Traction Fake projects typically struggle to build real organic momentum. MAGACOIN FINANCE, however, has attracted over 12,000 investors and continues to grow rapidly. With an active and expanding Telegram group, consistent engagement on X (formerly Twitter), and rising Google search volume, it’s clear that this is not a fly-by-night operation. This type of early momentum is often one of the strongest indicators of a successful launch post-presale. 3. High Utility Potential Compared to Meme Coin Hype Unlike typical meme coins that rely solely on viral marketing, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioned to offer real utility and long-term functionality. Although final roadmap details are still under wraps, insiders hint at DeFi integrations, a reward ecosystem, and possible staking functionality — all designed to create value beyond hype. This sets it apart from past fads and puts it closer to the trajectory Ethereum followed in its early days. 4. Strong Market Comparisons and ROI Forecasts Analysts have drawn comparisons between MAGACOIN FINANCE and early-stage Ethereum in terms of growth potential. With an entry price under $0.005, bullish projections suggest a 100x–1000x ROI may be possible if market momentum continues. Of course, all investments carry risk — but when paired with strong fundamentals and massive community support, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out in a crowded field. 5. Clear Differentiation From Typical Red Flags Many crypto scams operate anonymously, make unrealistic promises, or lack transparency. MAGACOIN FINANCE bucks that trend with a doxxed development team, published audit reports, open community channels, and consistent updates. The fact that it’s actively scheduling a CertiK audit further boosts credibility. Add to that a growing list of media mentions and strategic positioning alongside Ethereum, XRP, and Solana in coverage — and it becomes clear why the “scam” narrative doesn’t hold up under scrutiny. Final Thoughts While every crypto investment should be approached with caution, MAGACOIN FINANCE has already demonstrated significant legitimacy signals, a passionate community, and bullish fundamentals. With multiple security audits, public traction, and real growth drivers, it may not only be one of the best crypto presales of 2025 — but also a potential outperformer when compared to giants like Ethereum. FAQ Q: Is MAGACOIN FINANCE audited? A: Yes, it has been audited by Hashex.org, and a CertiK audit is currently underway. Q: How many investors are currently involved? A: Over 12,000 investors have contributed to the presale, and the community has surpassed 25,000 members. Q: Where can I buy MAGACOIN FINANCE? A: You can participate in the presale directly at https://magacoinfinance.com/presale Q: What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE different from other meme coins? A: It combines viral momentum with plans for utility, staking, and long-term use cases. Q: Could it really outperform Ethereum? A: While nothing is guaranteed, early comparisons show MAGACOIN FINANCE has stronger early-stage traction than many historical Ethereum competitors.

That said, Tuesday’s low at $108,700 may have been that bottom. Is the rebound loading, or could there be even more pain to come? $BTC momentum indicators reset Source: TradingView This current correction from top to bottom has so far totalled a loss of 12.74%, or in dollar terms, a much more impressive $15,800 haircut. However, If one takes into account that the previous bull flag correction was also around 12%, perhaps the current price malaise isn’t as bad as it feels. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI indicators have now reset. This is the situation for the other short-term momentum indicators, with even the daily time frame indicators coming to their low. Also, if one looks at the Binance futures liquidation heat map , there is a pocket of liquidity at $108,464, while up above, between $111,000 to $112,000, there is a whole lot more. $BTC resting on strong bull market price structure Source: TradingView The daily chart reveals the amount of support that the $BTC price has underneath where it currently sits. This is all good bull market structure, and should the price fall through this it really would be a cause for concern. That said, this is not expected to happen. The high probability is that the price bounces from this major horizontal support. Price indicators to turn positive again? Source: TradingView The weekly chart illustrates that the bulls still have work to do. Given the bearish movement for the $BTC price over these last 2 to 3 weeks, a lot of indicators have already signalled bearish price action. However, they mostly all lag the real price action, just like a super tanker that is yet to act on a 30 degree rudder movement. As long as the Bitcoin price does bounce from here, and that is a good possibility, the indicators will eventually reflect this, and by the end of the week, the MACD at least may still avoid the indicator line cross of the signal line, while the Stochastic RSI indicators might just slow their downward progress and start to lessen the angle of descent.

Bitcoin ETFs, including BRRR, are highly correlated with equities and US rates, raising questions about true decentralization and concentration risks. Given IBIT’s superior liquidity and similar fees, I rate BRRR as Hold, seeing better alternatives for bitcoin ETF exposure. The CoinShares Bitcoin ETF ( BRRR ) is an investment strategy designed to provide investors with direct exposure to spot bitcoin. The strategy utilizes cold storage for holding assets, creating a differentiated and more secured strategy for investors seeking exposure in bitcoin. BRRR was launched on January 10, 2024, following the approval by the SEC for the launch of bitcoin spot ETFs. CoinShares acts as the sponsor of BRRR, while US Bancorp Fund Services is the administrator. BRRR utilizes Coinbase Custody Trust Company ( COIN ), BitGo Trust Company, and Komainu Limited for custodian services. BRRR is indexed to the CME CF Benchmarks Bitcoin Reference Rate. BRRR utilizes cold storage with its custodians in the Vault Account, meaning that the bitcoin held is stored offline, disconnected from the Internet. This can add a certain layer of safety protocol to the assets as cybersecurity risks are generally mitigated. Seeking Alpha BRRR charges a sponsor fee of 25bps, in line with peer bitcoin ETFs. For all intents and purposes, bitcoin spot ETFs have no differentiation in terms of investment strategy, each moving in tandem with the price of bitcoin. The core differentiators will be fees and liquidity. By comparison, I believe that the best bitcoin spot ETF to invest in would be the lowest of cost ETF that provides enough liquidity with minimal spread risk. From a fee perspective, VanEck’s ( HODL ) may prove to be the most appealing on the market as the sponsorship fee is waived until January 2026. Seeking Alpha Aside from fees, a major differentiator may be assets under management and fund flows . Many of the bitcoin ETFs have remained relatively stagnant since launching at the beginning of 2024 in terms of net asset growth, while BlackRock ( IBIT ) has consistently grown above all others. Given that bitcoin ETFs may be used for liquidity in the market, ETF liquidity may be just as important as investing in a low-fee strategy. BRRR has roughly $655mm in assets under management with an average of 186k shares changing hands on a daily basis. By comparison, IBIT has accumulated roughly $84b in net assets since launch and has an average daily trading volume of 45mm shares. Bitcoin ETF Fund Flows From a tactical perspective, BRRR is directionally correlated with the S&P 500 ( SPX ) to a certain degree. Some estimate that bitcoin has an 83% correlation to the SPX. I believe that the driving factor behind this high level of correlation is the broad adoption of investors holding bitcoin ETFs within retirement accounts. Given that bitcoin is now viewed as an alternative asset class for retirement accounts, bitcoin ETFs will likely be utilized similarly to other asset classes in relation to the functions of a financial advisor, such as portfolio rebalancing, allocations, and cash raises. This can potentially deteriorate the decentralized aspect of bitcoin. TradingView Interestingly enough, bitcoin faced some selling pressure following recent news of Cleveland Federal Reserve President Beth Hammack not supporting an interest rate cut. This may suggest that bitcoin exhibits a certain degree of correlation to the interest rate policy set by the Federal Reserve, making bitcoin more of an extension of the US Dollar as opposed to being an uncorrelated, independent asset. In addition to this, bitcoin exhibits some correlation to the 10-year treasury rate, suggesting that the price of bitcoin may be more tied to US rates than one may have expected. TradingView In terms of the growth trajectory for bitcoin, Bernstein analysts expect bitcoin’s rally to continue into 2026 and potentially into 2027, expecting bitcoin to run up to $200,000/BTC. Though this is an achievable price target for bitcoin, climbing to those levels appears to face some skepticism given that bitcoin tactically faces some chop at around $120k per coin. From a tactical standpoint, bitcoin may be moving more into a bearish trend rather than one that would push the token to $200k/BTC. TradingView Risks Related to Bitcoin ETFs Bitcoin ETFs exhibit concentration risk as a single-asset investment strategy. If investing in BRRR or other bitcoin ETFs, the investor should use a weighted portfolio approach to ensure exposure is balanced. The federal government is weighing the use of BitBond issuances to cover payments of the national debt. With the federal government moving into the cryptocurrency space, the decentralized appeal may be declining. Bitcoin is also becoming more heavily invested in by institutional investors as a component of an investment portfolio strategy; bitcoin may be subject to rebalancing, asset rotation, and cash raises. Final Thoughts Considering peer bitcoin spot ETFs, I believe BRRR may be a less optimal strategy for investment purposes. Given the stronger trading depth and similar fee in IBIT, I believe other bitcoin strategies may be more appealing for investors. I am recommending BRRR with a Hold rating.",BRRR,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MACROECONOMICS|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-08-26 09:28:45

The DeFi token is at presale stage 6 priced at $0.035. It will be up by 14.29% to $0.04 at stage 7. Members entering this phase will see a minimum of 400% returns when the token is active. Mutuum Finance has already crossed $14.9 million and more than 15800 investors. While other known altcoins maintain their dominant positions, sentiment in the market is increasingly shifting in favor of new platforms such as Mutuum Finance that plan to revolutionize decentralized finance in 2025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Two-Tier DeFi Lending Framework Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is an innovative non-custodial decentralized DeFi protocol. The project is capable of Peer-to-Contract lending and Peer-to-Peer lending with high efficiency and flexibility in operations. Peer-to-Contract utilizes the smart contract feature to lend with minimum or no human involvement. Peer-to-Peer eliminates middlemen and has borrowers and lenders directly interact and exchange with each other. The model is extremely easy to handle risky assets like meme coins. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Success Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is blazing with presale taking the spotlight. It is in stage 6 at $0.035. It will also rise to 14.29% to $0.04 in the next phase. Investor demand is growing with the project already reaching over $14.9 million and already boasting a token holder base of over 15700. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) USD-Pegged Stablecoin Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is launching its new overcollateralized USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. With a strong and long-standing foundation, the stablecoin has extremely high chances of being stable and safe for decades to come. The project also boasts a 95.0 trust score as presented by a Certik audit. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has recently introduced its Bug Bounty Program with a $50,000 USDT bounty.

In a post on X, Armstrong argued that the combination of regulatory clarity, institutional inflows, and government adoption will fuel Bitcoin’s journey to this milestone. His confidence rests on a clear trend – the United States and other global powers are not only opening the doors to crypto ETFs but are also beginning to hold Bitcoin in national reserves. This vision of Bitcoin’s future resonates across the industry. It also highlights how other emerging projects, such as MAGACOIN FINANCE, are gaining momentum as investors search for the next big opportunity beyond Bitcoin. With Armstrong pointing to an era of mainstream adoption, the market’s appetite for early-stage tokens that could deliver exponential returns is growing stronger than ever. Why Armstrong Sees Bitcoin at $1 Million Armstrong identified regulatory clarity as the biggest catalyst for Bitcoin’s long-term growth. He explained that once the U.S. finalizes its market structure and stablecoin rules, institutional investors will be far more confident in raising their Bitcoin allocations. At present, most funds hold just around 1% of their portfolios in BTC – a figure Armstrong believes could multiply once legal frameworks are cemented. He also highlighted the U.S. government’s creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve as a turning point. Alongside the GENIUS Stablecoin Act and upcoming Market Structure Bill, these measures represent a coordinated federal approach that reduces uncertainty and pressures other G20 nations to follow suit. Institutional Confidence and National Reserves Armstrong noted that sovereign reserves and institutional allocations are no longer theoretical. Governments are increasingly engaging directly with digital assets, while ETFs provide easier access for asset managers. This structural foundation, he argues, will establish Bitcoin as a core component of global financial systems. Industry voices back this view. Arthur Hayes of BitMEX has issued similar forecasts, while DeFi strategist Carmelo Ippolitto emphasized that Bitcoin’s rise is less about speculation and more about the monetization of digital scarcity on a global scale. Where MAGACOIN FINANCE Fits In While Bitcoin aims for the $1 million mark by 2030, smaller projects are already making waves today. MAGACOIN FINANCE recently raised $12.5 million in record time , passed a full HashEX audit, and continues to grow its community at an explosive pace . Early investors have already seen returns climb as much as 7,800% , proving that the project has captured serious attention from across the industry. With exchange listings on the horizon and adoption milestones stacking up, analysts believe MAGACOIN FINANCE could be one of the rare altcoins to rival the early breakout stories of DOGE or SHIBA. How to Position Your Portfolio Now For investors preparing for Armstrong’s bold $1 million target, balance is key. A core position in Bitcoin provides stability and exposure to the largest digital reserve asset. Layering in Ethereum or other established coins can add diversification, while allocating a smaller portion toward high-growth plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE offers the chance to capture big returns if the project continues its trajectory. This mix allows investors to benefit from the security of blue-chip crypto while still seizing the upside potential of fast-growing altcoins. The Bigger Picture Armstrong’s $1 million forecast is not simply speculation – it reflects the maturation of the crypto sector, with regulatory reforms, sovereign strategies, and ETF adoption laying the foundation for Bitcoin’s next era. For investors, the message is clear: portfolios should be positioned now, not later. Bitcoin offers stability as the reserve asset of digital finance, while opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE provide the high-growth upside that early movers crave. As global markets adapt to the new reality of digital assets, those who prepare today may stand to benefit the most tomorrow.

The warning was posted on Truth Social, where Trump wrote: “I put all Countries with Digital Taxes, Legislation, Rules, or Regulations, on notice that unless these discriminatory actions are removed, I, as President of the United States, will impose substantial additional Tariffs on that Country’s Exports to the U.S.A.” Trump also wrote that: “We will institute Export restrictions on our Highly Protected Technology and Chips.” He didn’t stop there. In the same post, he added, “Show respect to America and our amazing Tech Companies or, consider the consequences!” The message was aimed at dozens of nations, mostly U.S. trade partners, that are currently applying digital taxes targeting American platforms like Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon. Trump has long said these policies are built to punish American innovation. And he’s done more than talk. Back in June, when Canada was set to activate its own DST, Trump pulled out of trade negotiations. Just before the tax took effect, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government walked it back, a move the White House immediately claimed as a win. “Canada caved,” officials said publicly. Trump pushes trade threats over magnets, chips, and planes Digital taxes aren’t the only issue on Trump’s table. On Monday, while speaking to reporters following a meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, Trump threatened tariffs on China’s rare-earth magnet exports, saying, “They have to give us magnets, if they don’t give us magnets, then we have to charge them 200% tariffs or something.” He tied the issue to a critical supply chain that the U.S. depends on for national security and tech manufacturing. Trump also revealed that airplane parts are being used as leverage in his ongoing confrontation with China . He said, “200 of their planes were unable to fly because we were not giving them Boeing parts purposely because they weren’t giving us magnets.” That threat landed while Boeing is still finalizing a major deal with China involving as many as 500 aircraft. The talks cover models, types, and delivery terms. China’s monopoly on rare-earth magnets gives them major control in any tech-related negotiation. They produce 90% of the global supply, and they dominate refining too. In April, China placed export controls on the materials, which sent shipments crashing. But by June, exports to the U.S. rebounded, surging 660% from the month before, and climbing another 76% in July. These magnets are essential for electronics, electric vehicles, and defense systems, making the U.S. position in that supply chain especially vulnerable. Digital taxes draw bipartisan backlash in U.S. Trump’s fight against digital taxes hasn’t just come from the Oval Office. In 2023, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden and Ranking Member Mike Crapo jointly warned the U.S. Trade Representative that Canada’s DST would expose “innovative American companies to arbitrary discrimination.” The letter was part of a growing push inside Congress to defend U.S. firms from foreign tax grabs. The countries enacting DSTs say they’re simply asking for fairness. They argue that tech companies earn billions from users in their territory but pay nothing in return. They see the taxes as compensation for digital services that operate inside their borders while avoiding domestic tax systems. Trump doesn’t care for that reasoning. He believes these rules are custom-built to target American companies, especially the ones big enough to show up on global balance sheets. His latest post drew a line: any law that hits U.S. tech will be treated as a hostile act. That includes not just taxes but any regulation, rule, or proposal tied to digital services. And now, Trump is adding tech exports and rare-earth materials into that same trade fight. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Taking on X, formerly Twitter, Crypto Bull noted , “XRP cup & handle pattern completed, Next stop is $7.” The cup-and-handle pattern, a rounded 'U' followed by a brief consolidation dip, signals strong bullish momentum when broken. According to Crypto Bull, XRP has now completed this formation on higher timeframes, setting the stage for a potential rally toward $7. His analysis aligns with a recent forecast that XRP might be eyeing a 200% move to $9.63 based on historic cycle trends. XRP is tightening around the $2.91 level , and with its position as the world’s third-largest cryptocurrency, the next move could set the tone for both short- and long-term momentum. Goldman Sachs & BNY Mellon Push $7.1T Money Market Onto Blockchain — Ripple Joins the Revolution According to market analyst Xaif Crypto, two of Wall Street’s most influential players, Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon, are making a decisive leap into blockchain by moving the $7.1 trillion money market industry onto digital rails. The initiative centers on tokenizing money market funds, enabling faster settlements, reduced friction, and more transparent transactions. In a move that caught the attention of the crypto community, Ripple (XRP) has also entered the partnership, underscoring the growing convergence between traditional finance and blockchain-native networks. Money market funds are traditionally viewed as one of the safest investment vehicles, offering stability and liquidity for institutions and retail investors alike. However, the behind-the-scenes mechanics remain bogged down by slow settlement processes, operational inefficiencies, and limited cross-border accessibility. By leveraging tokenization, Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon aim to streamline this multitrillion-dollar segment, cutting costs and enabling real-time settlement. Ripple’s involvement adds a significant layer to the story. Known for its focus on cross-border payments and institutional-grade blockchain solutions, Ripple brings the technological infrastructure to bridge legacy finance with blockchain-native efficiency. XRP’s utility in providing liquidity and settlement speed positions it as a natural fit within a tokenized money market ecosystem. If fully integrated, it could enhance liquidity management, improve capital efficiency, and extend access to global investors. Xaif Crypto stressed that this isn’t just a pilot, it’s the start of a structural shift. When firms managing trillions adopt blockchain tokenization, it stops being hype and becomes the rewriting of global financial markets. For crypto, the implications are massive. Tokenizing a $7.1 trillion market shows blockchain is moving well beyond speculation, gaining institutional trust as core financial infrastructure. Ripple’s role underscores its position as a pivotal enabler in the digital asset economy. Conclusion Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon’s move to tokenize the $7.1 trillion money market marks a watershed moment for traditional finance and blockchain. With Ripple in the mix, the initiative underscores how legacy giants and crypto innovators are converging to modernize one of the world’s largest asset classes. On the other hand, if Crypto Bull’s analysis holds, XRP could be on the verge of a breakout that commands market-wide attention. With the cup and handle pattern complete, $7 emerges as a clear technical target, offering both traders and long-term holders a decisive roadmap.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|MARKET|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-26 09:33:44

The achievement places XRP futures alongside Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) in CME’s “$1B club,” a level often viewed as the threshold where liquidity deepens and institutional capital starts to shape pricing. CME Milestone Signals Institutional Confidence The CME Group, which was ranked by Forbes earlier in the year as the most trusted crypto exchange globally, announced that its entire crypto futures suite had topped $30 billion in notional open interest for the first time. Within that, BTC futures remain the largest at more than $16 billion, while ETH holds $10.5 billion. Solana and XRP have both crossed $1 billion, but XRP’s speed in reaching the mark has caught the industry’s attention. Pseudonymous market watcher SonOfaRichard highlighted that reaching $1 billion in open interest signals “the big leagues” for liquidity, as spreads tighten and risk desks begin treating contracts with the same seriousness as BTC and ETH. He added that XRP’s rapid climb suggests institutions are allocating significant size rather than testing the waters, potentially paving the way for deeper derivatives markets and even ETF products. The achievement comes against a backdrop of increasing ecosystem expansion by Ripple. The company has just partnered with Gemini to launch an XRP-focused credit card that also integrates its RLUSD stablecoin. This follows Ripple’s earlier support for Gemini’s IPO plans and represents another step in extending XRP’s use cases in payments and tokenization. Price Action Cools Despite Derivatives Growth Despite the derivatives milestone, the price of XRP has struggled to hold above $3. Data from CoinGecko shows the asset trading at $2.92, down slightly by 0.8% on the day and 3.1% over the past week. The drop-off is even bigger across 30 days, with XRP down almost 10% in that period, putting it nearly 20% below its July 18 all-time high of $3.65. Nonetheless, it remains up 390% year-on-year. Technical analysts remain cautious. As reported by CryptoPotato, there have been heavy exchange inflows from large holders, suggesting ongoing profit-taking that could pressure prices further. Furthermore, analyst Duo Nine recently flagged a descending triangle pattern and warned that if XRP fails to reclaim $3 convincingly, bears could drive it toward the $2.7 support.

The carnage was concentrated in BTC and ETH , with altcoins dragged into the rip current. The big question now: is this a reckoning, or the setup for a rebound? The breakdown: How $940M liquidated crypto rocked Bitcoin and Ethereum Liquidations hit across majors, but the heaviest damage landed where the leverage was densest. Fresh tallies show ETH traders took about $320M in forced unwinds, while bitcoin-linked liquidations came in near $277M. SOL, XRP, and DOGE combined added tens of millions more to the flush, underscoring the scale of this leveraged liquidation crypto event . That distribution squares with the weekend’s rotation into ETH beta and the subsequent unwind once price momentum snapped. At the top level, multiple desks pegged the 24-hour liquidation total near $900M–$940M as BTC slipped through psychological support and ETH fell harder on a percentage basis, fueling the day’s ETH crash news headlines. That aligns with market dashboards and same-day reporting. 💥BREAKING: Over $840,000,000 liquidated in the cryptocurrency market in the last 24 hours. pic.twitter.com/fdp880p97x — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) August 25, 2025 Why below $110K matters Numbers on a screen become tripwires in derivatives markets. $110K has operated as a clean line in the sand for systematic strategies and discretionary traders alike-slicing below it triggers algo selling , reduces order book depth, and forces deleveraging on platforms where collateral marks-to-market. Once the level gave way, BTC tagged the high-$109Ks intraday, amplifying the liquidations cascade. The psychology is simple: sub-$110K emboldens shorts, stresses over-margined longs, and cues volatility sellers to hedge, often at the worst moment, creating a reflexive downdraft that doesn’t need much spot selling to accelerate. JUST IN: Bitcoin falls under $110,000 pic.twitter.com/gLLDO1rxSv — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) August 25, 2025 Macro squeeze + fragile liquidity The backdrop wasn’t friendly. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have registered a run of net outflows in recent sessions, reversing prior inflows and draining passive bid support at the margin. Ether funds also bled capital late last week. Meanwhile, ETF trading volumes cooled, and options desks priced in bigger swings. Together, those flows point to a more fragile liquidity regime where sharp moves travel farther. Microstructure tells the same story. Recent research and desk notes highlight thin order books on weekends and during macro event run-ups; even modest flows can push prices disproportionately. Asia-based QCP Capital framed prior bounces as “thin-liquidity” surges in strength, which can fade quickly when real demand isn’t there. None of this means institutions have vanished. Banks note that corporate and ETF demand for ETH has been building and that allocations remain a medium-term tailwind, evidence that accumulation continues beneath the volatility, even as near-term flows wobble. What traders are saying (and seeing) Volatility regimes have been shifting. Earlier in August, implied vol (Deribit’s DVOL) jumped off multi-year lows, a classic tell that bigger moves were coming. Into this break, options flow skewed toward downside protection, and realized swings followed. Rising BTC and ETH vol confirms the leverage reset is in motion. Desk chatter also emphasizes how quickly over-leverage unwinds once key levels give way: funding cools , open interest bleeds, and liquidation clusters get “vacuumed” in chunks, all visible in the last 24 hours’ liquidation maps and OI drops. “Traders echoed that sentiment. A desk note from Derixe.xyz highlighted how the sell-off was ‘the result of overleveraged positioning following ETH’s recent run-up, compounded by an overnight dip in the S&P 500 that pressured risk assets more broadly.’ In other words, crypto’s tumble wasn’t happening in a vacuum; it was magnified by fragile positioning and macro headwinds.” source: Coindesk What’s next on the watchlist Key supports: Traders are eyeing the $105K-$100K zone for BTC as the next high-confluence area (prior acceptance, options interest pockets, and round-number psychology). Slice cleanly through $105K and the market likely tests $100K to probe real demand. Bounce catalysts: A turn in spot ETF flows back to net inflows, calmer macro headlines, or a volatility crush after options expiries could fuel an oversold snapback. Watch how price behaves on first tags of $108K-$110K-failed breakdowns, there often trap late shorts. Risks: If ETF outflows persist and macro prints sour (e.g., hotter inflation, dollar bid), leverage can reload on the wrong side, inviting another forced-selling leg. Thin weekend books remain a known hazard. Conclusion With $940M liquidated crypto in a single day, and Bitcoin surrendering $110K, the sea looks rough, but seasoned traders know that sharp washouts often pave the runway for big comebacks. This feels less like “the end” and more like the end of complacency. Whether it becomes a deeper correction hinges on flows: do ETFs and spot buyers step back in, or does macro keep the tide out?

These demands came despite the trader already completing multiple KYC requirements, including live video verification, address proof, and phone number confirmation. The exchange’s Global Head of Customer Service, Derrick, personally extended the invitation, offering a “ VIP experience ” and luxury accommodations while insisting that face-to-face meetings are necessary to complete the verification process. Update: MEXC Attempts To Lure The White Whale To Meet In Person…For Potentially Sinister Reasons?? I received an email from MEXC (with my anti-phishing code and from their official domain). I triple-verified – it was authentic. The email claimed: “Our leadership team… — The White Whale (@TheWhiteWhaleHL) August 25, 2025 Security Concerns Mount as Crypto Kidnappings Rise Globally The controversial demand comes amid growing concerns about crypto-related kidnappings and security risks facing high-net-worth individuals. The White Whale, who claims to hold over $100 million in on-chain assets, rejected the meeting proposal, citing personal security concerns and noting that MEXC’s Terms of Service contain no requirements for in-person KYC procedures. MEXC froze the trader’s account in July 2025 under vague “ risk control ” protocols without prior notice or clear explanation. When the trader expressed reluctance to travel, Derrick’s response was telling: “ But I understood that you have sought to expedite the unfreezing of your account ,” essentially linking fund access to the Malaysia meeting requirement. The incident has sparked widespread social media backlash under the hashtag #FreeTheWhiteWhale , with multiple users reporting similar account freezes and fund seizures by MEXC. Exchange Doubles Down Despite Missing Legal Basis for In-Person Demands MEXC’s persistence in demanding face-to-face verification lacks foundation in their published terms of service, raising questions about the exchange’s compliance procedures. After the Malaysia proposal was rejected, Derrick suggested Hong Kong as an alternative location, claiming it would be “ one of the safest countries ” for the meeting. The exchange representative acknowledged the unusual nature of their request, stating, “ this is indeed not a usual process, but I am really trying to help out for your appeal. ” He characterized the in-person meeting as part of a “ manual verification process as an exception ” to facilitate the fund release appeal. The White Whale has already completed extensive verification procedures accepted by MEXC during previous reviews, including liveness checks, address verification, and phone number confirmation. Source: X/@TheWhiteWhaleHL The trader emphasized having provided all requested documentation and questioned why additional verification requirements emerged without clear justification. MEXC’s approach contrasts sharply with standard industry practices, where remote KYC procedures typically suffice for account verification and fund access. The exchange’s inability to point to specific terms of service provisions supporting their demands undermines the legitimacy of their verification requirements. The situation escalated as MEXC attempted to frame the meeting as a collaboration opportunity, with Derrick mentioning “ enhanced trading perks ” and “ exciting partnership opportunities ” alongside the verification process. However, the trader remained focused solely on fund recovery and account closure rather than on ongoing business relationships. Pattern of Account Freezes Emerges as Users Report Similar Treatment Multiple MEXC users have reported comparable experiences with arbitrary account freezes and questionable fund recovery procedures. Pablo Ruiz documented losing access to $2.08 million USDT after his account was frozen on April 17, 2025, under “risk control” protocols with no clear explanation or appeal mechanism. On April 17, 2025, @MEXC_Official froze my account due to a vague “risk control” protocol, without prior notice, explanation, or any opportunity to cooperate. Since then, nearly 3 months have passed, and my funds — totaling $2,082,614 USDT — remain fully inaccessible.… pic.twitter.com/ZCCVpqSgRh — Pablo Ruiz (@pabloruizoka) July 13, 2025 MEXC informed Ruiz that his account review would take 365 days, with instructions to “contact us again on 04/17/2026.” The exchange provided contradictory information, at one point claiming the risk control process was completed while support insisted the review remained ongoing. Previous incidents from 2024 included “clawback” allegations where MEXC reportedly reversed profitable trades and confiscated funds from user accounts. Trader “ Al Gore Rhythms ” had $33,658 deducted from his spot account, with MEXC claiming they have “taken measures to recover the losses incurred” due to “abnormal trading activities.” Another case involved CoackKCrypto, who alleged MEXC seized $330,000 “due to abnormal profit” without clear justification or due process. Users reported that MEXC deleted transactions from their history and provided automated responses rather than substantive explanations for enforcement actions. The offshore exchange operates with less regulatory oversight than publicly listed U.S. companies, potentially contributing to inconsistent enforcement practices. Multiple enforcement entities continue investigating various offshore exchanges following the FTX collapse, while users increasingly question custodial risks associated with centralized platforms lacking transparent dispute resolution mechanisms. At the time of publication, the MEXC team has neither released the funds nor provided any clarity on the matter.

MNT serves as the native gas token for transaction fees on Mantle and as the governance token for Mantle DAO, enabling holders to propose and vote on protocol changes. According to Mantle, the MNT token also powers staking and incentive mechanisms to support network growth and participation. The total supply is capped at 6.219 billion MNT , with allocations for ecosystem development, governance, and treasury purposes as outlined in Mantle’s governance framework. “Mantle’s modular approach to scaling Ethereum, combined with its community-driven governance model, aligns with our vision of a decentralised economy. We are pleased to add MNT to our diverse range of digital assets available for trade,” said Anoush Bhasin, Head of Listings at Bitfinex. Bitfinex customers will be able to make deposits of MNT at approximately 2:00 PM UTC on 26/08/2025, subject to network conditions. Trading is planned to commence at approximately 2:00 PM UTC on 28/08/2025, contingent upon liquidity requirements being met.

The AI model emphasized that Bitcoin’s short-term outlook points to further downside, with the likelihood of more weakness in September 2025. According to ChatGPT, Bitcoin is currently trading near $110,000 after being rejected at $117,000, facing heavy selling pressure from whales. Key Bitcoin price levels to watch It noted that Bitcoin rarely pauses at round numbers, instead seeking liquidity zones, which makes the $106,000 and $108,000 region a likely “bear trap” before a sharper move lower. If support at $112,000 fails, the next key cushion lies between $105,000 and $108,000. A clean break of that range could trigger a quick dip toward $98,000 and $100,000. At the same time, the model highlighted that seasonality adds weight to this bearish setup. Historically, September has been one of Bitcoin’s weakest months , with only a 40% win rate and an average return of –2.5% since 2015. Combined with thinning liquidity ahead of typical Q4 rallies, conditions appear ripe for a sharp flush. Therefore, ChatGPT-5 projects a high probability that Bitcoin will crash below $100,000 in September 2025, most likely within the next two to four weeks. The drop would likely be steep, driven by liquidations and panic selling. However, the model expects demand from ETFs, corporates, and long-term holders to provide strong support in the $95,000 and $98,000 range, preventing a prolonged stay under six figures.

The 50-day SMA sits higher at $116,528, suggesting BTC remains under short-term pressure and is struggling to regain bullish momentum. Meanwhile, the 200-day SMA at $95,119 provides strong underlying support, indicating that the broader long-term trend still leans positive despite recent pullbacks. On the momentum side, the 14-day RSI stands at 37.97, placing Bitcoin close to oversold territory but not yet at an extreme. Featured image via Shutterstock.

A significant development has just emerged from the Resolve (RESOLV) Foundation: the launch of its highly anticipated RESOLV token buyback program. This initiative marks a crucial step in the foundation’s strategy to strengthen the token’s market position and reward its loyal holders. For anyone tracking the RESOLV ecosystem, this program signals a commitment to sustainable growth and long-term value creation. What is the RESOLV Token Buyback Program? The Resolve Foundation has officially commenced a dedicated buyback program for its native RESOLV token. This strategic move aims to reduce the circulating supply of RESOLV tokens, which can positively impact its market price and overall stability. The program is designed to be both consistent and dynamic, ensuring it adapts to the ever-changing crypto landscape. Funding Source: The buyback program is entirely funded by the protocol’s own revenue. This means that as the Resolve ecosystem generates income, a portion of that income directly flows back into supporting the RESOLV token. Execution Frequency: Buybacks will occur on a weekly basis, providing a steady and predictable demand for the token in the open market. Initial Allocation: In its inaugural week, an impressive 75% of the protocol’s revenue was dedicated to the RESOLV token buyback . This substantial initial commitment underscores the foundation’s confidence and serious intent. How Does the RESOLV Token Buyback Benefit Holders? For current and prospective RESOLV token holders, this buyback program brings several compelling advantages: Potential Price Appreciation: By reducing the total supply of tokens available in the market, a buyback program can create upward pressure on the token’s price, assuming demand remains constant or increases. Enhanced Scarcity: Fewer tokens in circulation means each remaining token becomes scarcer, potentially increasing its perceived and actual value over time. Increased Investor Confidence: A foundation actively investing its own revenue back into its token demonstrates a strong belief in the project’s future. This can attract new investors and reassure existing ones. Long-Term Stability: Consistent buybacks can help to mitigate price volatility, contributing to a more stable and predictable market environment for RESOLV. Understanding the Strategic Allocation of Revenue for RESOLV Token Buyback The Resolve Foundation isn’t just launching a simple buyback; it’s implementing a flexible and responsive strategy. While the first week saw 75% of revenue allocated to the RESOLV token buyback , this percentage is not fixed. The foundation explicitly stated that the allocation will be adjusted weekly. Why this flexibility is crucial: Market Conditions: The crypto market is notoriously volatile. Adjusting the allocation allows the foundation to respond to current market trends, ensuring the buyback is most effective whether the market is bullish or bearish. Growth Strategy Alignment: The foundation has a broader vision for the Resolve ecosystem. This flexibility ensures that resources can be optimally allocated between buybacks and other critical growth initiatives, such as development, marketing, or partnerships. This dynamic approach highlights a mature understanding of tokenomics and project management, aiming for both immediate token health and long-term ecosystem expansion. What are the Broader Implications for the RESOLV Ecosystem? Beyond direct token benefits, the RESOLV token buyback program has wider implications for the entire Resolve ecosystem. It signals a robust economic model where protocol revenue directly contributes to the foundational strength of its native asset. This creates a virtuous cycle: as the protocol grows and generates more revenue, more funds are available for buybacks, further supporting the token and, in turn, attracting more users and developers to the ecosystem. This proactive management of token supply is a hallmark of sustainable blockchain projects. It demonstrates a commitment to building a resilient and thriving environment for all participants. Actionable Insights for RESOLV Holders As the Resolve Foundation embarks on this exciting new phase, what does it mean for you? Stay Informed: Keep an eye on weekly announcements from the Resolve Foundation regarding buyback allocations and overall strategy. Evaluate Market Trends: Understand how the buyback program interacts with broader market movements. Consider Long-Term Potential: This program is designed for long-term value creation. Short-term fluctuations are normal, but the underlying mechanism aims for sustained growth. The launch of the RESOLV token buyback program is a significant milestone for the Resolve Foundation, underscoring its dedication to fostering a strong and valuable ecosystem. By leveraging protocol revenue, the foundation is taking concrete steps to enhance token stability, increase scarcity, and build unwavering investor confidence. This strategic, adaptive approach positions RESOLV for exciting growth and a more resilient future in the dynamic world of decentralized finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the RESOLV token buyback program? A1: It’s an initiative by the Resolve Foundation to purchase its own RESOLV tokens from the open market using protocol revenue, aiming to reduce circulating supply and enhance token value. Q2: How often will the RESOLV token buyback occur? A2: The buyback program is executed on a weekly basis, providing consistent market support for the RESOLV token. Q3: What funds the RESOLV token buyback program? A3: The program is funded entirely by the revenue generated by the Resolve protocol itself. Q4: How will the allocation percentage for the buyback be determined? A4: The allocation percentage, which started at 75% in the first week, will be adjusted weekly based on market conditions and the Resolve Foundation’s growth strategy. Q5: What are the main benefits of a RESOLV token buyback for holders? A5: Benefits include potential price appreciation due to reduced supply, increased scarcity, enhanced investor confidence, and greater long-term market stability for the RESOLV token.

Major players are pouring funds into these altcoins, shaking up the market. This brief dive will uncover why these two cryptocurrencies are stealing the spotlight and which coins show potential for significant growth. Solana Price Review: Past Momentum and Current Trading Levels Solana displayed a steady climb over the last month, with prices rising by 9.32% and a broader surge of 41.60% over the past six months. Price action predominantly traded within the $142.77 to $204.08 range, emphasizing healthy short-term strength with a weekly uptick of 6.81%. This performance has fostered positive sentiment among investors, reflecting the market’s ability to embrace newer highs while maintaining key levels. These movements lay the groundwork for possible further gains in the near future. Currently, Solana is testing important technical levels, with support around $113.23 and resistance near $235.85. The trading range suggests a balance between bulls and bears, as bulls appear to have the upper hand, keeping price action above lower support while approaching resistance. Indicators such as the Awesome Oscillator at 15.11, Momentum Indicator at 18.20, and RSI of 60.58 signal an upward drive but also highlight the need for caution. Trading strategies should focus on buying on dips near support and monitoring for breakouts beyond resistance, which could shift into support. Additional trading opportunities may arise from movements toward the second support at $51.92 or the second resistance at $297.16. Cardano’s Upward Momentum Amid Short-Term Corrections Over the past month, Cardano gained 9.80% and increased 31.38% over the past six months. A recent one-week pullback of 6.76% reflects some short-term volatility. This performance shows a coin that has steadily grown over time, with strength and intermittent corrections that have not hindered its longer-term upward path. The current price range is between $0.54 and $0.94, with key support at $0.34 and resistance at $1.14, while a higher barrier appears at $1.54. Indicators like the moderately positive relative strength index of 55.54 suggest a slight edge for bulls. However, the near-zero Awesome Oscillator and slightly negative momentum indicate a cautious trading sentiment. There is no clear trend, allowing for buying near support and potential selling around resistance. Traders may consider opportunities within this range, monitoring the balance between bullish recovery and short-term dips. Conclusion The strong performance of SOL and ADA highlights their growing appeal among institutional investors. These coins are gaining traction as significant players in the altcoin market. Continued interest and investment could signify robust growth prospects. As institutional money continues to enter, SOL and ADA are positioned as noteworthy picks.

With anticipation building, remarkable growth potential is seen in specific coins come September. This article delves into the promising prospects of XRP , Chainlink , and POL , identifying them as top picks for those looking to capitalize on the upcoming market surge. XRP Market Outlook: Past Trends and Present Levels XRP registered a 5.02% decline over the past month, while the six-month view shows a robust gain of 28.575%. The recent drop contrasts with a strong upward movement over the past six months. This performance highlights fluctuating sentiment, with short-term challenges overshadowed by longer-term gains. Recent trading indicates a modest setback, but the overall six-month rally reflects the coin's ability to recover and build upward momentum. Current price action is testing levels between $2.23 and $3.74. The nearest support is at $1.43, with resistance at $4.46 and a second resistance at $5.97. Bears have exerted downward pressure as technical indicators show slightly negative momentum. There is no clear trending direction at the moment. Traders might consider entering near support with a tight stop or selling into strength near the first resistance level. Watching for a breakout above $4.46 could lead to testing higher barriers, while a failure may provide short-term sellers an exit opportunity. Chainlink Climb: Accelerated Growth with Strategic Support and Resistance Chainlink showed strong upward movement in the past month and six months, with gains of 43.46% and 71.47%, respectively. This price action highlights heightened investor interest and consistent momentum. A weekly increase of 2.25% reflects a cautious but steady pace within the broader upward trend. Over the last half-year, LINK has risen from lower levels, driven by sustained demand, establishing a trading corridor that indicates increased market participation. Currently, LINK is trading within a defined range, facing immediate support at $9.12 and resistance at $24.18. Longer-term boundaries are set at $1.58 below and $31.71 above. Technical indicators reveal that bulls remain dominant, but caution is needed as the relative strength index stands at 62.81, approaching overbought territory. Watching for a break above $24.18 could signal further bullish momentum, while a drop toward support may present attractive buying opportunities. POL (ex-MATIC): Price Trends, Key Levels, and Trading Ideas Over the past month, POL experienced a modest rise of about 5.70%, while the six-month change shows a drop of roughly 9.30%. This reflects mixed recent performance. The weekly price change held steady at 0%, with the coin trading in a range between $0.17 and $0.25. This movement over time marks a period of minor volatility, where short-term gains contrast with a longer-term decline. At current prices, the coin has support near $0.13 and a more critical level around $0.04, while resistance is first observed at $0.30, with a second level at $0.39. Price action within the $0.17 to $0.25 range highlights caution, with bulls showing some strength as indicated by an RSI of 53.56. The trend is not yet clear, suggesting traders consider buying near support and aiming for profits as price nears resistance levels. Short-term trading ideas focus on maintaining stops just below the $0.13 support and monitoring for a move above $0.30 to signal a potential bullish breakout. Conclusion XRP , Chainlink , and POL are poised to benefit from recent federal rate cuts. XRP's adoption in the financial sector continues to grow. Chainlink's role in providing reliable data for smart contracts positions it well for expanded use. POL's unique features make it an attractive option for investors looking to diversify. Overall, these three coins have strong potential for notable gains in September. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Their innovative technology and rapid adoption have started drawing substantial investments. This article delves into why these specific altcoins may be poised for remarkable gains, unveiling the secrets behind the significant ""smart money"" flow heading their way. Avalanche Market Insights: Steady Growth with Defined Price Levels Recent AVAX performance shows a modest gain over the past month with a 4.26% increase, while the half-year period reflects an even stronger 13.99% rise. Price fluctuations have been steady, with a slight weekly drop of 0.14% that did not hinder the ongoing upward trend. The figures indicate a gradual build-up of strength in the market with sustained positive movement over time. There is a clear progression from short-term minor variations to more pronounced growth across the longer term, underlining steady performance without dramatic spikes or falls. Currently, Avalanche trades within a range of roughly $17 to $27, sitting neatly between key levels that shape trader decisions. The immediate resistance is seen at $32.69 and nearby support at $11.89, while more distant thresholds exist at $43.09 on the upside and $1.49 on the downside. This clearly defined price corridor hints at a market where bulls appear to have a slight edge. Oscillator readings such as the Awesome Oscillator at 0.95, momentum at 1.24, and an RSI of 54.56 provide further support for a gently bullish stance. Trading within these levels might favor entry strategies if price manages to breach the resistance. Arbitrum Steers Through Key Levels with Steady Upward Momentum Strong gains mark ARB over the past month and six months. The coin advanced by approximately 28% in the last month and registered a 35% surge over six months. Price movement over the past weeks reinforced growing investor confidence, with weekly prices showing a positive progression of around 6%. Past data reflects consistent upward movement, highlighting increased interest in the coin over time. Numbers show sustained upward shifts during recent periods, indicating that both short-term and longer-term investors have maintained their positions. Current price action shows ARB trading between $0.30 and $0.50 with crucial levels in play. Nearest resistance sits at $0.60 while support is firm around $0.21, setting clear reference points for trading. A second resistance at $0.80 and a second support at $0.14 offer additional markers for entry and exit strategies. Bulls appear to control the scene as momentum and oscillator signals point to more gains, although the trend is yet to be fully established. Trading within these levels could focus on buying near the support of $0.21 or $0.30 and aiming to sell close to the $0.60 mark. Conclusion AVAX and ARB are attracting significant attention from investors. Both coins show promise with their innovative features. Their potential to capture market interest is strong. The flow of smart money towards them indicates confidence in their future. It suggests these coins might play pivotal roles in the market.

Traders Seek Refuge In Remittix",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/sol-drops-back-below-200-is-it-heading-to-150-traders-seek-refuge-in-remittix/,"In recent weeks, Solana (SOL) has been under pressure. As the coin dropped back below $200, dealers and investors became alarmed. If support doesn’t hold, technical charts indicate a possible decline toward $150, which may lead some market players to search for other projects with better development and utility possibilities. Remittix (RTX) is emerging as one such alternative, attracting both retail investors and whales. Solana: Price Pullback Raises Concerns SOL has had difficulty keeping up its pace, dropping from its peak in the middle of the year to $197.94. The strain is on short-term holders since volatility is still high. According to on-chain data, exchange inflows have surged, which may indicate that some SOL investors are reducing their holdings in order to control risk. Source: TradingView Key technical levels include $195 as initial support, with a more critical support at $180. Resistance lies near $210–$215. Analysts note that while Solana continues to boast a strong ecosystem, including DeFi, NFT and Layer 1 applications, price action is signaling caution for traders seeking near-term gains. Why Crypto Traders Are Eyeing Remittix With SOL showing weakness, attention is shifting to utility-driven altcoins like Remittix (RTX) . The project has seen strong whale accumulation and community engagement in August. Investors are drawn to its PayFi model, which enables seamless crypto-to-FIAT conversions across multiple countries, supporting over 50 cryptocurrencies.

Here’s why it’s attracting smart money: The next exchange listing will be announced when presale funding hits $22 million, creating anticipation and liquidity. Community-driven features like staking and social engagement are building a loyal base of long-term holders. Analysts highlight the low entry price and potential for rapid upside toward $5 if adoption continues. With real utility, expanding adoption and upcoming exchange announcements, Remittix (RTX) is positioned as a more stable alternative for traders seeking growth while Solana faces downward pressure.

Mainly, the targets to trigger the next altcoin season have been set above the $5,000 level, where it seems most of the bullish pressure has been waiting. So far, Ethereum has yet to break this major target, but a machine learning algorithm has predicted that this level will be surmounted within a very short timeframe. Ethereum Price To Finally Beat $9,000 The machine learning algorithm of the CoinCodex has placed Ethereum above the $5,000 mark very soon. The 5-day prediction, which will carry through to the end of this week, shows that a 10% move is coming before the week is over. This would put the Ethereum price above the $5,200 level and mark a brand-new all-time high since 2021. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Head And Shoulders Pattern Signals 540% Upshoot To New All-Time Highs This prediction comes as the market has continued to skew bullish, especially with Ethereum breaking above $4,800 recently. Ethereum’s bullishness is expected to carry on into the month of September, where the machine learning algorithm also puts it above $5,200 for the month. While the short-term prediction for the Ethereum price is positive, the main move is expected to happen in the last quarter of the year. The months of October, November, and December are expected to see the Ethereum price at higher all-time highs than the previous month, expecting to close out the year 2025 in the green. For the month of October, the machine learning algorithm expects the price to cross $8,100, resulting in an over 69% increase in price from here. Then, for the next month, November 2025, is when the price is expected to cross the $9,000 level. This means that the timeframe for the Ethereum price to reach $9,000 could be as little as three months. As for December, the price is expected to retrace from $9,000, but still maintain a high level. The max price is placed at $7,278, and the min price at $6,876. This means it would still be a more than 50% increase from the current price. Q4 Is Where The Magic Happens Historically, the last quarter of the year has always been bullish for the Ethereum price, so it is no surprise that the machine learning algorithm expects the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap to hit a new all-time high in Q4. According to data from CryptoRank, four out of the last five years have seen the last quarter of the year close with double-digit gains for Ethereum. Related Reading: This Week In XRP: Ripple CTO Set To Announce Important Update The last time that the price had hit a new all-time high was also in the month of November, coinciding with the expectation that ETH will hit a $9,000 ATH in November this year. If the trend holds, then Ethereum might be in for an incredibly bullish Q4, putting in average gains of over 20% before the quarter is concluded.

50702802,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=792388,1756202413,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50702802.jpeg,China drives 300% surge in semi-finished steel exports,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/china-300-surge-in-semi-finished-steel/,"China has dumped a staggering 7.4 million tons of semi-finished steel into the global market between January and July 2025, a 320% increase compared to the same period last year, according to reporting from Bloomberg. These exports, mostly steel billets, are now dominating international steel trade, despite global attempts to throw up barriers. This wave comes as China’s domestic demand stays weak, especially in real estate and construction. Steel billet exports, which used to make up only a sliver of China’s overall shipments, hit 1.5 million tons in July alone, making up 14% of all outbound steel that month. Countries like Vietnam and South Korea have been targeting finished steel with anti-dumping rules, but that hasn’t touched semi-finished products. That’s where the trade shifted. Beijing boosts exports as hot-rolled coil shipments fall Jinshan Xie, a ferrous analyst at Horizon Insights, said the rise in semi-finished exports will likely continue unless Beijing steps in. “Unless there are mandatory production curbs that restrict domestic supplies, we expect billet exports to continue as China is very price competitive,” Jinshan said. The appeal of semis is simple, they’re harder to regulate and cheaper to ship. That’s why while hot-rolled coil exports dropped 13%, semi-finished steel went up by more than four times. But not everyone inside China agrees with the surge. The China Iron and Steel Association argued in July that this trade damages local processing capabilities. They claim the steel is being exported raw, only to be rolled abroad, leaving China with wasted industrial capacity. They also said the trend keeps iron ore prices inflated, which hurts domestic steelmakers who still rely on expensive raw materials. Despite those concerns, the shipments kept moving, mostly to Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Indonesia took in 1.14 million tons, making it the top buyer so far this year. The Philippines came next with just under a million tons, then Turkey, Italy, and Saudi Arabia followed. This rerouting of steel flows has caught attention, especially since most governments had focused on restricting finished steel, not these unfinished blocks. Trade envoy heads to Washington as tensions linger While the steel keeps moving, Beijing is sending Li Chenggang to Washington this week. The Wall Street Journal reported that Li, who is now vice commerce minister and trade envoy, will meet with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Treasury Department officials. He’s also scheduled to meet U.S. business leaders, marking the first major visit since the countries agreed on a temporary truce. That pause came after President Donald Trump gave China 90 more days without new tariffs. Beijing matched that with its own delay. That gives both sides a bit more time to deal with other disputes—like Trump’s duties tied to fentanyl trafficking, Washington’s objections to China buying sanctioned Russian and Iranian oil, and complaints about American firms operating inside China . Still, the steel surge is another stress point. Jeremy Chan, senior analyst at Eurasia Group, said the focus should stay on trade, not tech or fentanyl. “Trade and tariffs — rather than tech or fentanyl — should be the focus, given Li-Greer pairing,” Jeremy said. He also noted that China sending Li shows they’re serious about progress. “It’s a bullish sign for a deal that will unlock a summit” between Trump and Xi Jinping, he added. Trump himself confirmed interest in meeting Xi, saying Tuesday, “Probably during this year or shortly thereafter, we’ll go to China.” That lines up with Beijing’s own goals to reopen direct communication and try to reset the economic relationship, at least temporarily. Earlier this year, China promoted Li to his new post. Before that, he had been China’s ambassador to the World Trade Organization, giving him long experience with international trade disputes. His meetings in D.C. could determine what happens next with the steel flood, and whether Beijing decides to rein it in or keep pushing metal out to keep its economy alive.

50702384,565255,1756202419,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50702384.jpeg,Is Chainlink Replacing XRP In SBI’s Strategy? Pundit Breaks It Down,https://bitcoinist.com/chainlink-replacing-xrp-sbi-strategy-pundit/,"SBI Group’s new tie-up with Chainlink has ignited a debate inside the XRP community: is Ripple’s long-standing beachhead in Japan at risk, or is SBI building a broader stack that still leans on XRP for settlement? The partnership, announced over the weekend, will see Chainlink’s interoperability and data infrastructure deployed for financial-market use cases in Japan first and then across Asia-Pacific, including tokenized funds, regulated stablecoins and payment-versus-payment (PvP) foreign-exchange workflows. XRP Vs. Chainlink? The contours of the deal are explicit: SBI says it will leverage Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) to move messages and assets across networks; use Chainlink’s data tooling to bring fund net asset value (NAV) data on-chain for tokenized funds; and apply Chainlink’s Proof of Reserve to verify that stablecoins are fully backed. In parallel, SBI continues a flurry of digital-asset initiatives, including separate agreements with Ripple and Circle last week. That remit overlaps with but does not replicate Ripple’s utility inside SBI’s payments stack . Since 2021, SBI Remit has run live XRP-based corridors out of Japan—first into Philippine wallets and, by 2023, into bank accounts in the Philippines, Vietnam and Indonesia—using XRP as a bridge asset to eliminate pre-funding. Ripple’s Japan–Thailand flow, powered with Siam Commercial Bank, predates even that. SBI VC Trade, the group’s licensed crypto exchange, also lists XRP. These are production rails, not proofs-of-concept. The new Chainlink alignment is therefore best read through division of labor. Chainlink’s CCIP is an interoperability and messaging layer; it is not a payments network that provides working capital or market-making liquidity. Chainlink’s Proof of Reserve is an attestation service to automate reserve checks for stablecoins and other tokenized assets. In industry pilots—from DTCC’s “Smart NAV” to Sygnum/Fidelity’s on-chain fund data—Chainlink has been the plumbing that standardizes data and connects chains, rather than the rail that actually moves fiat value. That framing is precisely what one prominent community pundit argued as the announcement landed. “Chainlink handles the instructions and data,” wrote pundit Ripple Van Winkle (X: @RipBullWinkle). From there, his analysis constructs a clear separation of roles. “But here’s the key: Chainlink doesn’t provide liquidity. It can route trades. It can prove reserves. It can sync data across chains. But when it comes to actually settling value? That’s not Chainlink’s role.” In his view, the SBI partnership plugs Chainlink into the orchestration layer—governing cross-chain messages, validating collateral and standardizing data—without supplanting the asset that actually bridges currency pairs in production remittances. He anchors that to SBI’s existing footprint: “SBI Remit uses XRP in live corridors (Japan→Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand).” He underscores that the token’s status in Japan is not a theoretical placeholder but a live, regulator-recognized crypto asset: “XRP is regulator-approved in Japan as a crypto asset.” The implication inside his thread is straightforward: where tokenized cash is not present, and where rapid, low-friction cross-border flows are required, XRP remains the bridge asset SBI already relies on. On the scope of the new collaboration, the pundit calls it “big league infrastructure,” listing the focus areas as “Tokenized funds & real-world assets (real estate, bonds), Regulated stablecoins, FX settlement with Payment-vs-Payment (PvP), [and] Liquidity + compliance rails for institutions.” He then itemizes what Chainlink brings to that stack: “CCIP → Cross-chain interoperability & messaging,” “SmartData (NAV) → Fund pricing / data oracles,” and “Proof of Reserve → Audits + compliance.” In a single line summary: “Translation: Chainlink handles the instructions and data.” Both Can Co-Exist For SBI Where many in the community framed the announcement as an either-or decision for SBI, he pushes back. “This is where Ripple + XRP stay critical.” He contends that XRP is the piece that “bridges currencies where tokenized cash isn’t available,” while Ripple—through its software, partnerships and operational rails—serves as “the liquidity muscle.” That is a direct rejoinder to the “threat” framing, arguing complementarity rather than substitution. His most quotable shorthand crystallizes the architecture he believes SBI is building: “Think of it like this: Chainlink = Control Layer (messaging, compliance, data), Ripple/XRP = Settlement Layer (bridging money across borders), SBI = The Integrator combining both into one financial stack.” The assignment of roles is intentionally modular: Chainlink to secure and move instructions across chains; Ripple/XRP to move value across markets; SBI to integrate and choose the optimal rail per corridor and instrument. That leads to his headline conclusion. “So does this threaten Ripple? No. It expands the rails.” In his words, “SBI is hedging smartly — building a multi-rail system. That way tokenized FX, stablecoins, and RWAs on Chainlink rails… …can still settle in XRP when needed. SBI isn’t choosing Chainlink over Ripple. They’re choosing both. Because the future of finance isn’t one-rail. It’s interoperability + liquidity.

Experts Are Favoring This Token To Surpass ETH’s Gains For Reasons,https://timestabloid.com/which-crypto-to-buy-today-for-short-term-experts-are-favoring/,"While many investors track Ethereum (ETH)’s historical gains, a growing number of experts are pointing toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the short-term crypto poised to deliver faster multiples. Unlike Layer-1 networks with saturated adoption curves, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will provide immediate, functional DeFi exposure. At a presale price of $0.035, MUTM will offer early participants access to a decentralized stablecoin that maintains a $1 value through overcollateralized minting and burning. Users will stake mtTokens in designated smart contracts to earn MUTM rewards, and the protocol will use generated revenue to buy back MUTM from the open market, amplifying demand and creating consistent buy pressure. The platform’s unique integration of Layer-2 efficiency ensures that lending, borrowing, and stablecoin transactions will execute at lower costs and faster speeds compared to typical Layer-1 networks. For short-term traders and active crypto investors seeking momentum beyond ETH’s curve, this combination of functional DeFi tools and immediate staking rewards positions MUTM as a standout option. Phase 6 Presale and Roadmap Insights At the core of MUTM’s short-term appeal is the ongoing presale. Phase 6 has already generated approximately $14.9 million, with 25% of the 170 million tokens sold. The total supply of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be 4 billion tokens, and over 15,700 holders are actively participating in building the community. The upcoming Phase 7 will see a 15% price increase to $0.040, creating urgency for investors to secure tokens at the current discounted rate before the next phase. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s 4-phase roadmap will guide the token’s growth and utility adoption. Phase 1, largely executed, established the presale, marketing campaigns, giveaway, CertiK audit, and AI-powered helpdesk. Phase 2 will focus on core smart contract development, front-end and back-end infrastructure, advanced analytics, and risk parameter implementation. Phase 3 will finalize the platform with a beta demo launch, security checks, documentation completion, and preparation for exchange listings. Phase 4 will deliver the live Mutuum Finance (MUTM) platform, token listings across exchanges, multi-chain expansion, advanced features, institutional partnerships, and the MUTM claim process. Stablecoin innovation will add depth to the ecosystem. By minting only against overcollateralized assets and burning on repayment or liquidation, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will ensure the stablecoin stays at $1. Interest rates will be governed to maintain price stability, and arbitrage opportunities will naturally adjust supply-demand dynamics. Users staking mtTokens will earn MUTM rewards sourced from platform revenue, reinforcing long-term engagement and consistent token demand. Investment Examples Justifying Short-Term Potential A Phase 1 investor who acquired MUTM at $0.01 while diversifying from ETH and BTC will see a trajectory toward the $0.06 listing. As the platform launches its beta, staking mechanisms activate, and buybacks increase, the token’s functional utility will support a projected climb toward $1. This demonstrates a faster short-term momentum compared to Ethereum (ETH)’s historical adoption curve, making Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a compelling candidate for traders seeking immediate returns. Investors leveraging mtToken staking and platform utility will benefit from a compounding effect: lending and borrowing activities generate revenue, a portion of which buys MUTM on the open market, distributed as staking rewards. This creates a feedback loop of liquidity, usage, and price support. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s combination of stablecoin innovation, Layer-2 efficiency, and structured buyback strategy will position early adopters for accelerated growth while the broader market adjusts to its utility. The $50,000 USDT bug bounty program, with Critical rewards up to $2,000, Major up to $1,000, Medium $500, and Low $200, ensures security across the ecosystem. Alongside the $100,000 giveaway for ten winners, these incentives will drive community engagement and attract additional users. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s CertiK audit, achieving a Token Scan score of 95 and Skynet score of 78, underscores platform reliability, while a growing Twitter community exceeding 12,000 followers will continue to amplify awareness. Conclusion Short-term investors focused on crypto charts and identifying momentum are likely to prioritize tokens with both utility and structural demand. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at $0.035 offers this combination: staking rewards, revenue-driven buybacks, stablecoin utility, and a clear roadmap for platform delivery. With Phase 6 25% sold and Phase 7 price set to rise to $0.040, early participants will secure a position ahead of the surge, positioning themselves to outperform ETH’s short-term growth trajectory. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is poised to be the crypto investment capturing attention from traders seeking actionable utility, immediate staking benefits, and structured growth. By aligning token mechanics with user activity and stablecoin innovation, MUTM will define the next wave of short-term crypto opportunity.

Avalanche and Polygon have established themselves as altcoins that continue to attract institutional investment. Meanwhile, newer projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are garnering interest too. Analysts say that the perfect combination of blue-chip assets and high-upside presales may be the best way forward to achieve outsized returns. Avalanche: Institutional Adoption and Expanding Use Cases Avalanche (AVAX) has certainly made a name for itself as a Layer 1 blockchain. Enterprise is a very popular network due to its high throughput and scalability. Partnerships with global payments and tokenized fund launches have brought billions in assets into Avalanche ecosystem recently. The Everest upgrade increased transaction efficiency and helped bring in liquidity in DeFi and gaming subnets. Avalanche is now trading in the mid $20s as the asset consolidates after recovery from the yearly low. The analysts highlighted the level of resistance at $25. In addition, they anticipate an increase towards $47 should this momentum continue. AVAX is still a credible solution for long-term adoption and institutionally led growth. Polygon: Driving Real-World Adoption Polygon (MATIC) remains a cornerstone in Ethereum scaling. Polygon is one of the most widely used Layer 2 networks due to ongoing interest in its zkEVM and new deals with global companies. Several key institutions are now utilizing MATIC for identity authentication and cross-border payments. This information might help MATIC to gain popularity beyond DeFi. The token may be currently trading below the $1 mark, but whales are accumulating the token. Meanwhile, technicals signal a likely recovery. Analysts have identified a near-term upside target range of $1.15-$1.22. Their outlook remains positive due to early enterprise uptake. Polygon shines through on all three counts of either institutional grade or scalability, or even basic security. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Breakout Opportunity Ahead of 2025 Avalanche and Polygon remain strong picks, but analysts say the bigger breakout opportunity lies with MAGACOIN FINANCE. With forecasts of 35x ROI and whale-backed inflows accelerating, it’s being ranked among the best cryptos to buy right now heading into the 2025 bull market. Having already surpassed major fundraising milestones and backed by verified audits, MAGACOIN FINANCE has garnered investor attention that extends far beyond meme speculation. Its capped supply model and transparent smart contracts provide strong fundamentals that distinguish it from many presales. Momentum is building quickly, with thousands of investors participating and growing speculation over future Tier-1 exchange listings. Analysts emphasize that MAGACOIN FINANCE could offer one of the rare high-growth opportunities of the cycle, balancing strong fundamentals with explosive upside. Why This Trio Matters Avalanche and Polygon are proven options adopted by the institution, making them low-risk, steady-growth assets. MAGACOIN FINANCE is a project with speculative upside, like a smaller-sized Solana or Dogecoin in previous cycles. If you desire stability with huge gains, then these three offers are the perfect choice for the 2025 bull run. Conclusion The best crypto to buy right now combines established growth with early-stage opportunity. Avalanche and Polygon remain essential altcoins for institutional adoption and scalability, but analysts increasingly highlight MAGACOIN FINANCE as the standout breakout play. With forecasts of 35x ROI, whale inflows, and strong presale momentum, Magacoin FINANCE could be one of the defining tokens of the 2025 bull run.

DOGE and PEPE are surging, capturing traders' attention. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu gears up for a significant comeback. Discover which cryptocurrencies are poised for explosive growth in this electrifying update. Dogecoin: Past Performance and Current Trading Levels in Focus Last month DOGE featured a slight decline of about 4.93% alongside a 3.42% drop over one week, while a six-month view shows an overall gain of 6.66%. Price moves have reflected short-term weakness and gradual recovery over a longer period. The figures reveal fluctuating interest among traders, with minor corrections typical of altcoin cycles. Data shows that during recent weeks, downward pressure was evident, whereas the recovery over six months hints at underlying strength. Performance has aligned with broader market adjustments seen in altcoins during volatile conditions. Current trading ranges between $0.15 and $0.28 with resistance levels at $0.35 and $0.48 further up, while the nearest support stands at $0.09. The Awesome Oscillator indicates a modest positive burst, but the Momentum Indicator tips slightly downward, and the RSI hovers around 50, signaling balance between buyers and sellers. There is no clear trend as bulls and bears operate within these levels. Trading strategies might include testing the first resistance at $0.35 for a bullish breakout, while monitoring support near $0.09 for potential dip-buying opportunities as market pressure evolves. Pepe Coin: Price Fluctuations and Key Levels in a Volatile Market Pepe experienced a marked decline over the past month with a 15.51% drop, while the weekly move down by 4.59% added to short-term pressure. Over the last six months, the coin rebounded with a notable 28.76% increase, suggesting recoveries when market conditions leaned positive. The journey from lows to highs within the period underscores a volatile price swing that caught the attention of traders. These shifts reflect an oscillating market sentiment that struggled between temporary bearish pulls and longer-term gains. The coin’s behavior offers insights into short-term corrections amid an overall recovery trend seen over the half-year. The current trading environment centers around a defined price range from $0.00000839 to $0.00001396. The nearest resistance stands at $0.00001714, with an immediate support level at $0.00000599. A secondary resistance at $0.00002271 and another support at $0.00000042 give more depth to potential breakout and pullback zones. Bears seem to be active given the negative momentum, though the RSI at 45.30 positions the coin in a neutral state. Traders might consider buying near support if the price holds, while a dip beyond critical support could open shorting opportunities. A move above the nearest resistance could ignite a bullish phase. Shiba Inu Price Dynamics: Trends, Declines, and Key Levels Shiba Inu exhibited moderate downward movement over its recent cycle. The price decreased by roughly 9.38% in a single month and maintained a similar decline over the last six months, reflecting persistent bearish pressure. A weekly decline of about 2% added to the overall weakness observed during this trading period. Volatility has been modest, revealing limited enthusiasm among traders despite the coin’s popularity. Observations indicate that multiple factors have placed the coin under pressure, resulting in price consolidation near lower levels. Current market activity shows Shiba Inu trading in a narrow price corridor with its value fluctuating between approximately $0.00001036 and $0.00001526. The nearest resistance stands at $0.00001807, while the closest support is near $0.00000827. Indicators suggest a balance without clear bullish momentum. Data from oscillator readings and moving averages hint that bears maintain considerable influence. Some traders may consider short-term selling if prices fail to break above initial resistance, while a bounce off support could present entry opportunities for cautious buyers. Monitoring key levels is essential as consolidation continues. Conclusion The ongoing rallies of DOGE and PEPE show a strong upward momentum. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is also gearing up for a potential major resurgence. The combined movements of these coins signal a vital phase for the meme coin market. Keeping an eye on these developments will be crucial for understanding future trends. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

In 2010, Bitcoin was worth a few cents. One year later, it hit $20. In six years, it was $17,000, and now it’s sitting at over $100K, after hitting an ATH of $123K in July. Historically, if you’d invested in Bitcoin at launch, you’d have an ROI of 188,643,000%. The likes of Mastercard, JP Morgan, and scores of S&P 500 companies are buying Bitcoin in droves. There’s never been anything like Bitcoin before, and investors are waking up to that reality. However, Bitcoin is getting old for modern standards. No dApps, no smart contracts, and almost non-existent DeFi scalability. It needs an upgrade. And that’s what Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is here to do with Layer-2 technology. Click to learn more about Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a crypto project planning to launch the fastest Layer-2 chain for Bitcoin. Its goal – to bring Bitcoin’s blockchain to modern standards. This means compatibility with dApps, smart contracts, and seamless DeFi programmability for developers.

HOW TO BUY $HYPER Today’s Bitcoin Technical Analysis After a nearly 3% drop yesterday, Bitcoin is finally showing the early signs of a rebound investors have been waiting for. At the time of writing, today’s daily candle is shaping up as either a hammer candle or at least a doji with a long lower wick. Both are classic reversal patterns often associated with swing lows, suggesting $BTC could rebound from here and continue its broader bullish trajectory. Further confirmation comes from the weekly chart, where Bitcoin is currently trading between the 0.5 and 0.618 Fibonacci retracement levels. This zone, which is often called the ‘golden pocket,’ represents an ideal corrective range and a common launchpad for the continuation of rallies. Adding to the bullish case, $BTC is now retesting its previous all-time highs ($108K-$112K), which have flipped into a critical support zone. Put together, these technical signals suggest an upcoming ‘digital gold’ rally may be on the horizon. $900M Liquidations Rock Market as Bitcoin, Ethereum Slide: Will Bitcoin Hyper Boost $BTC? August 26, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Bitcoin’s down over 12% from it’s all-time high only a couple of weeks ago – and no one’s sure if the bleeding has stopped. The recent ‘flash crash’ was apparently triggered by a whale selling off 29K Bitcoin, followed by a prolonged streak of outflows from Bitcoin ETFs. The combination has dealt a sharp blow to Bitcoin’s price aspirations. But it might also have set the stage for one of the hottest crypto presales this year – Bitcoin Hyper. An innovative Layer 2 solution, Bitcoin Hyper brings together Bitcoin’s reliability and the power of the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Learn more about Bitcoin Hyper in our guide. BitMine Buys 190,500 Ethereum in One Week, Fueling Bitcoin Hyper’s $12M Presale August 26, 2025 • 10:00 UTC BitMine bought 190,500 $ETH in just this past week alone, bringing its reserves to 1.71M tokens and increasing its combined crypto + cash holdings to over $8.8B. The company’s $ETH buying spree pushed BMNR by 12% on Friday, which BitMine Chair, Tom Lee, stated it helped gather more funds for additional buys. BitMine’s overarching goal is to own 5% of Ethereum’s total supply, which would position it as the undisputed leader in the Ethereum market. The company already has the largest Ethereum reserves among all public companies, according to CoinGecko . BitMine’s buying strategy is likely to rally the market as fall approaches, pushing projects like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) up the food chain.

In 2025, Dogecoin stands shoulder-to-shoulder next to Bitcoin. One is the first cryptocurrency, while our doggo friend is widely recognized as the first meme coin. Launched in 2013, $DOGE is up by over 38,000% today, looking at a price of over $0.21 and a trading volume in the billions of dollars. If anything, Dogecoin proves that ‘anything is possible’ in crypto, and even underdogs can become industry giants. With endorsements from industry moguls like Elon Musk and official investment vehicles like the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust, $DOGE seems to be going nowhere but up. Click to learn more about Maxi Doge Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is Dogecoin’s bodybuilder cousin chugging Red Bull and scalping cryptos at 3AM in the morning. Embodying full-send chaos and pump potential 2.0, $MAXI is for degen traders who don’t hesitate and keep diamond hands on some of the riskiest plays.

Today’s Dogecoin Technical Analysis Dogecoin fell sharply yesterday, dropping nearly 10% and closing firmly below key short-term moving averages (including the 10, 20, 50, and even the 200 EMA), signaling clear short-term bearishness. That said, the token hasn’t really moved much over the past couple of weeks, hinting at a potential accumulation phase. Plus, given that the broader trend remains bullish – as shown by the upward slope of all major EMAs on both the daily and weekly charts – this could simply be a prolonged consolidation period before the September rate cut, after which $DOGE may really rally. On the positive side, the weekly chart shows Dogecoin trading within the 0.5 to 0.618 Fibonacci retracement zone, often a sign of healthy correction rather than reversal. Additionally, the token is also currently resting on the 50 EMA on the weekly timeframe, which is yet another bullish technical signal. From $1K to $60K: and the Hunt for the Next $DOGE August 26, 2025 • 10:00 UTC If you’d invested $1,000 in Dogecoin five years ago, you’d be sitting on over $60,000 today; a staggering 6,000% return, far outpacing the S&P 500’s 87% gain over the same period. Despite starting out as a joke, Dogecoin’s virality and high-beta behavior have rewarded early adopters many times over, especially during crypto bull cycles. However, with its massive supply and limited utility, many analysts now view $DOGE as a saturated play. That’s why many degen traders seeking untapped upside are rotating into presale tokens like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) . Maxi Doge is a meme coin powerhouse built for 1000x leverage, zero-tax trading, and staking rewards up to 196% APY. With over $1.5M raised in its presale, and a low presale price of $0.000254, it’s got nothing but growth potential. If history repeats, the next 6,000% gains won’t come from legacy meme coins but from the next generation of presale tokens built for speed, staking, and scale.

ChatGPT Picks Maxi Doge ($MAXI) as the Best High-Risk, High-Reward Crypto to Buy Now August 26, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Crypto fever is heating up, fueled by rate cut expectations, expanding corporate treasuries, and a wave of pro-crypto policies from the U.S. government. While the recent consolidation phase might suggest otherwise, experts argue it’s exactly the setup needed for the next explosive run. Amid the noise, we asked ChatGPT for its top pick for the next 1000x crypto – and it didn’t hold back, pointing straight at Maxi Doge ($MAXI), a hype-fueled meme coin inspired by the success of Dogecoin. $MAXI isn’t just aiming to replicate the OG meme coin’s performance but to potentially surpass it – backed by heavy marketing campaigns, exclusive holder-only events, and a loyal community of meme coin degens.

ONDO and Chainlink are emerging as potential giants in the race, offering unique solutions in the real world asset sector. Enthusiasts and investors are keen to learn which tokens could dominate tomorrow's trillion-dollar market. This article explores these promising contenders. Ondo Price Overview: Recent Volatility and Key Levels Ondo experienced a gentle downward swing over the last month with a price drop of around 8%, reflecting a period of modest selling pressure. Over the past six months, the decline measured close to 5%, indicating less severe, steady weakness compared to the more recent performance. Price action during these periods showed range-bound behavior with occasional dips that slightly affected stability and sentiment, hinting at a market waiting for a clear directional push. Ondo's price scenario demonstrates a mix of caution and potential momentum as current trading levels orbit closely around key technical points. The asset is trading within a range of $0.71 and $1.14, while the nearest resistance stands at $1.38. A support level around $0.51 acts as an immediate safeguard, while bears remain dominant with key indicators showing slight downward momentum. The weekly drop of 5.23% and a monthly decline of 8.05% emphasize recent soft selling. Trading ideas include watching for a bounce from the $0.51 support as a potential entry point and monitoring the $1.38 resistance for further gains. Chainlink Climb: Accelerated Growth with Strategic Support and Resistance Chainlink showed strong upward movement in the past month and six months, with gains of 43.46% and 71.47%, respectively. This price action highlights heightened investor interest and consistent momentum. A weekly increase of 2.25% reflects a cautious but steady pace within the broader upward trend. Over the last half-year, LINK has risen from lower levels, driven by sustained demand, establishing a trading corridor that indicates increased market participation. Currently, LINK is trading within a defined range, facing immediate support at $9.12 and resistance at $24.18. Longer-term boundaries are set at $1.58 below and $31.71 above. Technical indicators reveal that bulls remain dominant, but caution is needed as the relative strength index stands at 62.81, approaching overbought territory. Watching for a break above $24.18 could signal further bullish momentum, while a drop toward support may present attractive buying opportunities. Conclusion ONDO and Chainlink (LINK) show promise as significant players in the coming years. Both are well-positioned due to their unique strengths and innovative approaches. ONDO's model appeals to those seeking stability and growth. Chainlink's technology ensures reliable data integration across various platforms. Together, these coins could attract significant investment and change the market. Keep an eye on them for future opportunities. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Rather than focusing on short-term speculation, the dialogue examined how certain networks are positioning themselves as essential infrastructure. The panel featured Dave Weisberger, President of BetterTrade.digital; Tillman Holloway, CEO of Arch Public Inc.; Andrew Parish, co-founder of Arch Public Inc.; and Joshua Frank, CEO of The Tie. In the video, Weisberger explained how platforms like XRP and Solana could evolve into systems that support global payments and trading at scale. The future is being built right now on $XRP Base layer for global payments Real infrastructure not just memes Could power stablecoins like RLUSD, Chasecoin & even JPM’s token Interoperability with SWIFT closer than ever pic.twitter.com/wLt95ois0d — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) August 25, 2025 Payments and Trading at the Core Weisberger noted that “two of the coins that are on there are XRP and Solana. XRP and Solana and a bunch of others are vying to be the base layer to support new transaction modalities.” At present, the financial system still relies heavily on centralized exchanges and proprietary frameworks. He emphasized that networks offering efficient alternatives stand to capture significant long-term value. XRP was described as leaning more toward international payments, while Solana leans more toward trading. He characterized both assets as potential components of a “newer globalized infrastructure.” Weisberger explained that Solana’s challenge lies in broadening beyond its current reputation. XRP’s Potential Role in Payments The conversation also highlighted XRP’s ambitions in the payments sector, particularly as an alternative to SWIFT . Weisberger explained that XRP’s long-term value would depend on whether it underpins major stablecoins. However, he noted that the list would need to be broader than just RLUSD, pointing to potential offerings from large banks like JPMorgan, noting that if these tokens were issued on the XRP Ledger, the asset would gain significant relevance in global finance.

Utility as the Decisive Factor Ultimately, Weisberger returned to the central theme of utility. He stated, “If they have utility, they will be worth more.” While Ethereum was briefly mentioned in the context of tokenization, XRP is dominating the real-world asset (RWA) tokenization market with real projects and increasing utility and adoption. With the financial industry now leaning toward blockchain-based solutions, XRP, which offers scalability, efficiency, and interoperability, could dominate the market and become the base layer for global payments and future financial infrastructure.

The world of digital collectibles is buzzing, but not in a good way. Recent data reveals significant NFT floor price drops across some of the most prominent collections. If you own a Pudgy Penguin or a Bored Ape, you might have noticed your digital assets taking a hit. This downturn has caught many investors by surprise, prompting questions about the stability of the NFT market. What’s Driving the Recent NFT Floor Price Drops? Major NFT collections, including the highly sought-after Pudgy Penguins, Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), and Doodles, have recently experienced double-digit declines in their floor prices. This means the lowest price at which an NFT from a specific collection is available for sale has significantly decreased. According to a report by Cointelegraph, data from DeFiLlama clearly illustrates this trend. For instance, the floor price for Pudgy Penguins saw a drop of approximately 17.3%. Similarly, the iconic Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) experienced a 14.7% decline. Doodles, a popular series known for its vibrant art, faced an even steeper fall, losing 18.9% of its floor value. These figures highlight a challenging period for the digital art and collectible space. What is the primary culprit behind these notable NFT floor price drops ? Many market analysts, including Cointelegraph, point directly to the short-term weakness observed in Ethereum (ETH). Ethereum is the foundational blockchain for most of these high-value NFTs. Therefore, when ETH experiences volatility or a decline, it often has a ripple effect on the value of NFTs built upon it. This particular downturn follows a period where Ethereum had recently achieved an all-time high, suggesting a market correction. How Do NFT Floor Price Drops Impact the Wider Crypto Market? The impact of these declines extends beyond individual collections. The overall NFT market capitalization has also felt the pinch. Data from NFTPriceFloor indicates that the total market cap for NFTs has decreased by about 5% over the past seven days, settling at approximately $7.7 billion. This broader market contraction signals a cautious sentiment among investors. When the underlying asset, like Ethereum, faces pressure, it naturally affects the perceived value and liquidity of associated digital assets. Investors often view NFTs as higher-risk, speculative assets. Therefore, during periods of broader market uncertainty or when a major cryptocurrency like ETH dips, capital tends to flow out of these riskier ventures first. This creates downward pressure on NFT floor price drops and overall market volume. Understanding this interconnectedness is crucial for anyone involved in the crypto space. The health of Ethereum directly influences the vibrancy and valuation of the NFT ecosystem. While some might see this as a temporary setback, it underscores the inherent volatility of digital markets. Navigating Volatility: Strategies for NFT Holders During Floor Price Drops For current NFT holders, experiencing these NFT floor price drops can be concerning. However, it’s important to approach such market movements with a strategic mindset. Here are a few considerations: Assess Your Holdings: Evaluate the long-term potential and community strength of your specific NFT collections. Strong communities and established roadmaps often weather market storms better. Understand the Macro Environment: Keep an eye on the performance of foundational cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. Their health is often a leading indicator for the NFT market. Avoid Panic Selling: While tempting, making impulsive decisions during a downturn can lead to losses. Consider your initial investment thesis and whether it still holds true. Look for Opportunities: For some, market corrections can present opportunities to acquire desirable NFTs at lower prices. Always conduct thorough research before investing. The current market conditions serve as a powerful reminder that the NFT space, while exciting, is still relatively young and subject to significant fluctuations. Diligence and a clear strategy are paramount. Conclusion: The recent double-digit NFT floor price drops for major collections like Pudgy Penguins, BAYC, and Doodles are a direct reflection of broader market dynamics, particularly the short-term weakness in Ethereum. While the overall NFT market capitalization has also shrunk, this period of correction offers valuable insights into the interconnectedness of the crypto ecosystem. For investors, understanding these drivers and adopting a strategic approach to volatility is key to navigating the evolving landscape of digital collectibles. The journey of NFTs continues, marked by both exhilarating highs and challenging dips. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What caused the recent NFT floor price drops? The primary cause for the recent declines is attributed to the short-term weakness in Ethereum (ETH), which is the underlying blockchain for most major NFT collections. When ETH’s value dips, it often affects the value of associated NFTs. 2. Which major NFT collections were affected by these drops? Prominent collections like Pudgy Penguins, Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), and Doodles all experienced double-digit percentage drops in their floor prices over the past seven days. 3. How does Ethereum’s performance relate to NFT values? Since most high-value NFTs are built on the Ethereum blockchain, the performance of ETH significantly influences their value. A decline in ETH can lead to a decrease in the perceived and actual value of NFTs. 4. Is the NFT market in a bear cycle? While the market has seen significant NFT floor price drops and a decrease in total market capitalization, whether it’s a full bear cycle depends on broader market trends and duration. It certainly indicates a period of correction and cautious investor sentiment. 5. What should NFT holders do during a market downturn? During a downturn, it’s advisable to assess your holdings, understand the macro environment, avoid panic selling, and potentially look for strategic buying opportunities if you have a long-term investment horizon. 6. Where can I find reliable data on NFT floor prices? Reliable data on NFT floor prices can be found on platforms like DeFiLlama and NFTPriceFloor, which track various collections and market statistics.

Accordingly, a similar move has now come from Pantera Capital, one of the giant names in the cryptocurrency industry. According to The Information, Pantera Capital is preparing to create a treasury company, Solana, with a $1.25 billion investment. Pantera Capital plans to raise up to $1.25 billion to spin off the publicly traded company into a Solana investment firm. Pantera will acquire a Nasdaq-listed company and convert it into a Solana-focused investment firm. This company could potentially be the largest Solana-focused treasury firm to date, as public companies currently hold 3.44 million SOL, worth approximately $650 million. Pantera Capital had already announced several hundred million dollars in crypto treasury projects before the big Solana move. Earlier this month, Pantera announced it had invested over $300 million in digital asset treasury (DAT) companies.

According to Dr. Ross, the idea that Bitcoin’s price is strictly tied to halvings is misleading. Instead, he argues that liquidity is the biggest driver of Bitcoin’s price , as the asset absorbs excess money supply just like other major asset classes. Ross compares fiat, gold, and Bitcoin: fiat loses value over time, gold holds value, but Bitcoin is unique as an appreciating store of value . He expects Bitcoin to remain volatile for years, only calming when its market cap approaches gold’s $20 trillion size. Until then, volatility will continue to fuel opportunities for large gains. To explain Bitcoin’s price action, Ross uses his “three-burner theory.” The first burner is liquidity, which has been strong since 2022. The second is the US economy—currently lagging due to weak manufacturing, though services are improving. Ross believes once economic data catches up, it will ignite Bitcoin’s next major upward move . The third burner is speculation: as confidence grows, leverage and risk-taking spread, often lifting Bitcoin and altcoins in another cycle. In his view, the recent slow market reflects delayed growth rather than weakness. Once the economy stabilizes under clearer policies, Ross expects Bitcoin’s second and third burners to switch on, pushing prices higher in a new cycle.",,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-08-26 10:13:58

We’re talking about the Dogecoin whales – those large holders making significant moves. They are actively accumulating DOGE, a trend that could signal a fascinating shift in market dynamics and potential future growth for the popular meme coin. Why Are Dogecoin Whales Accumulating Now? The recent activity of Dogecoin whales might seem counter-intuitive, especially with a short-term downturn affecting the wider crypto market. However, this isn’t just random buying; it suggests a strategic long-term perspective. Large investors often view market dips as prime opportunities to increase their holdings at lower prices, anticipating a rebound. A recent report by Decrypt highlighted this intriguing trend. It pointed to compelling data from Santiment, a leading on-chain analytics platform, which shows a significant uptick in large-scale DOGE transfers. These transfers, each valued at over $100,000, have noticeably increased since the start of August. This surge indicates a concerted effort by significant holders to add to their portfolios. Increased Large Transfers: Data reveals a distinct rise in DOGE transfers exceeding $100,000, signaling major buying activity. Growing Holder Count: The number of addresses holding between one million and 10 million DOGE has grown by 33 during the same period, indicating more large players entering or expanding positions. Shaun Young, a research analyst at MEXC, further emphasized that this consistent whale accumulation is a strong indicator. It suggests that long-term investors are not deterred by current market fluctuations; instead, they are anticipating a future rise in DOGE’s price. This conviction from significant holders often precedes notable market movements. What Does This Dogecoin Whale Activity Mean for DOGE’s Future? When powerful Dogecoin whales begin to accumulate, it sends a clear signal to the market. Historically, such significant buying pressure from large holders can often lay the groundwork for future price rallies. These investors typically have access to extensive research and a deeper understanding of market cycles, making their moves closely watched by the broader crypto community. Their current strategy suggests a belief in Dogecoin’s underlying value and its potential for growth beyond short-term volatility. This accumulation could lead to several positive outcomes: Foundation for a Rally: Increased demand from large buyers can absorb selling pressure and establish a strong price floor, making future upward movement more likely. Enhanced Market Confidence: When smart money moves in, it can boost overall investor confidence, potentially attracting smaller investors who follow the lead of larger players. Long-Term Stability: A strong base of long-term holders can contribute to greater price stability over time, reducing extreme fluctuations and fostering a more mature market. However, it’s crucial to remember that whale activity is just one factor among many. While it provides valuable insight, the crypto market remains dynamic and influenced by broader economic trends, regulatory news, and technological developments. Investors should always conduct their own research and consider multiple indicators before making any investment decisions. Are You Ready to Understand Crypto Whale Psychology? Observing the actions of Dogecoin whales offers a glimpse into the mindset of experienced market participants. These entities aren’t just buying on a whim; their decisions are often backed by extensive analysis and a long-term vision. They understand that short-term dips can present excellent entry points for assets they believe in, rather than causes for panic. Understanding this “whale psychology” can provide valuable context for your own investment decisions. It teaches us to look beyond immediate price movements and consider the bigger picture. While it doesn’t guarantee future returns, it highlights the importance of patience and strategic planning in volatile markets. Key Takeaways from Whale Accumulation: Patience is Key: Whales often accumulate over time, demonstrating a patient, measured approach to market entry. Value in Dips: They view market corrections as opportunities to acquire assets at a discount, not just threats to their portfolio. Long-Term Vision: Their moves are typically geared towards long-term appreciation rather than chasing quick, speculative gains. This ongoing accumulation by Dogecoin’s largest holders is a compelling narrative in today’s crypto landscape. It underscores a belief in Dogecoin’s enduring appeal and potential, even when headlines focus on market volatility. This quiet accumulation might just be the prelude to an exciting new chapter for DOGE. In summary, the strategic accumulation by Dogecoin whales amidst a broader market downturn is a powerful signal. It suggests that significant investors are looking beyond current fluctuations, building positions for what they anticipate will be a strong long-term rally. This activity highlights a fundamental principle of investing: buying low when others are fearful, and positioning for future growth. As these whales continue to gather DOGE, the crypto community watches closely, anticipating what this sustained confidence could mean for Dogecoin’s journey ahead. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a Dogecoin whale? A: A Dogecoin whale refers to an individual or entity holding a very large amount of DOGE, typically enough to influence market prices with their transactions. These large holders are closely watched for their potential impact on Dogecoin’s value. Q2: Why do Dogecoin whales accumulate during a market downturn? A: Whales often accumulate during downturns because they view these periods as opportunities to buy assets at lower prices. They anticipate that the market will eventually recover, leading to significant profits on their larger holdings. This is a common strategy among long-term, strategic investors. Q3: Does whale accumulation guarantee a price rally for DOGE? A: While whale accumulation is often a bullish indicator, it does not guarantee a price rally. The cryptocurrency market is influenced by numerous factors, including broader economic conditions, regulatory changes, and overall market sentiment. However, it does suggest strong underlying confidence from significant investors. Q4: How can I track Dogecoin whale activity? A: You can track Dogecoin whale activity using on-chain analytics platforms like Santiment, Whale Alert, or similar services that monitor large cryptocurrency transactions. These platforms provide data on significant transfers and wallet movements. Q5: Is Dogecoin considered a good long-term investment based on whale activity? A: Whale accumulation indicates confidence from large investors, which can be a positive sign for long-term prospects. However, whether Dogecoin is a “good” long-term investment depends on individual risk tolerance, investment goals, and further personal research into its fundamentals and ecosystem developments. Always conduct your own due diligence. Did you find this analysis of Dogecoin whales and their strategic moves insightful?

It’s followed by OKB (OKB) , which fell 8.4%, now trading at $172. Meanwhile, economist and Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff argued that BTC would slip to about $75,000 , maybe more. He advised BTC holders to “sell now and buy back later.” He wrote that “given all the hype and corporate buying, this weakness should be cause for concern.” According to Schiff’s prediction, Bitcoin could plunge to the level last seen on April 2025. “At a minimum, a decline to about $75K is in play, just below $MSTR’s average cost.” Bitcoin just dropped below $109K, down 13% from its high less than two weeks ago.

Sell now and buy back lower. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) August 26, 2025 The Path Ahead Could Be Bumpier Than Expected Sean Dawson, head of research at onchain options platform Derive.xyz , commented that chances of BTC falling to $100,000 by end of September increased from 20% to 35%, while the chances for ETH retesting $4,000 in the same period surpassed 55%. He stated that: “With macro pressure building and volatility spiking, markets are resetting fast, and the path ahead could be bumpier than many were positioned for.” Notably, “it’s been a bloody start to the week for the majors,” said Dawson. There was over $900 million in liquidations across the market, with ETH and BTC seeing the most of that amount: $324 million and $209 million, respectively. Also, “nearly all were long positions forced underwater after a broad-based correction.” Source: Derive.xyz, Coinglass “This sharp move appears to be the result of overleveraged positioning, particularly following ETH’s recent run-up, and an overnight dip in the S&P 500, which weighed on risk assets more broadly,” Dawson writes. Subsequently, short-dated volatility has surged. Daily BTC volatility jumped from 15% to 38%, and ETH volatility went from 41% to 70%. “These moves reflect rising trader anxiety ahead of key macroeconomic catalysts, notably US GDP figures due to be released August 28 and the unemployment rate to be released early September,” Dawson says. Source: Derive.xyz, Amberdata Finally, there was also a shift in sentiment. As an example, Dawson gave the 25-delta skew turning negative for BTC and ETH, showing a preference for puts over calls. “This is the strongest demand for downside protection we’ve seen in two weeks. Traders appear to be bracing for potential retests of $4K for ETH and $100K for BTC,” he concluded. Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing on Tuesday morning, BTC trades at $109,971. The coin saw another sharp plunge for the second day in a row. It went down from $112,815 to $109,214. It’s now 11.4% away from its all-time high of $124,128. Moreover, it’s possible that the price will continue to move towards the $105,000 level. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView Ethereum is currently trading at $4,414.

The board agreed that the easing could be slow or fast, but acknowledged that global risks and the flow of incoming economic data would determine the pace. The RBA’s board emphasized that further rate cuts are necessary to maintain stable and low inflation and preserve full employment. It advocated for gradual easing but a quicker move through the procedures, although the results of this strategy are still up in the air. The board concluded it was probably best if the pace of rate cuts was determined by reviewing data on a meeting-by-meeting basis. Cryptopolitan reported the RBA cut its main interest rate by a quarter-point to 3.6%, and is expected to make at least three more cuts by early next year. Unlike other central banks, the RBA moves slowly and relies on data, not market pressure. The bank planned to act cautiously as it expects inflation to remain below 2.6% for 2025 and 2026, before dropping to 2.5% by the end of 2027. Bullock says RBA is not under pressure to lower rates RBA governor, Michele Bullock, stated that the Australian central bank is not pressured to lower rates like its counterparts. She pointed out that the central bank did not push policy as high during the tightening campaign in 2022-23. However, economists allege that there may be two more cuts by March 2026. Governor Bullock previously said that projections suggested a lower cash rate to keep inflation stable and low, but cautioned that there is still a lot of uncertainty. She reflected this uncertainty when she declined to comment on whether the 3.6% rate was restrictive or not. However, the governor stressed that the RBA is committed to ensuring full employment while keeping inflation in check. “Forecasts imply that the cash rate might need to be a bit lower than it is today to keep inflation low and stable and employment growing but there is still a lot of uncertainty.” – Michele Bullock , Governor of the RBA Data from the RBA revealed that headline inflation eased to 2.1% in Q2 and the trimmed mean core inflation rate hit 2.7%, a new three-year low. Meanwhile, the labor market also eased as the rate of joblessness dropped from 4.3% to 4.1% in a month. The data also confirmed that consumer spending is slowly picking up as the low inflation effects of previous cash rate cuts finally filter through the economy. U.S. tariff policy compels accelerated easing The RBA board agreed that the effects of U.S. tariffs added to the case for quicker easing. It suggested a faster pace if inflation risks undershooting the 2-3% targeted range, or if the labor market continues to weaken. However, gradual policy easing would probably be warranted if private demand shows signs of recovery, the neutral rate becomes uncertain, and the labor market remains tight. Belinda Allen, the Head of Australian Economics at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, noted that potential downside labor market risks superseded upside inflation risks. She pointed out that further easing over the coming years is likely needed if the economy’s recovery is slower than expected. The economist believes the interest rate will trough at 3.35%. Investors are also betting that the RBA will skip September and wait until November to make a move. They foresee the rates easing from the current rate to 3.35%, then settling at around 3.10% before dropping to as low as 2.85%. The RBA board also discussed whether to increase the pace of running down government bond holdings. However, the board decided not to change its current strategy of waiting for the bonds’ respective maturity dates. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Davis’s wallets bought YZY within a minute of its announcement, per Bubblemaps. He’s also linked to LIBRA, MELANIA, and WOLF coins — all with controversial histories. YZY Coin Linked to Kanye West Sparks Controversy as LIBRA Co-Founder Reportedly Nets $12M LIBRA co-founder Hayden Davis has reportedly earned around $12 million from trading YZY, a memecoin associated with rapper Kanye West (Ye), according to a detailed analysis by blockchain analytics firm Bubblemaps. The YZY token launched on August 21, 2025, and immediately stirred controversy due to its insider-heavy tokenomics and massive early gains made by unidentified wallets. Experts now say that some of those wallets may be linked to Davis—who already has a controversial history in the crypto space. Who Is Hayden Davis and What’s His Crypto Track Record? Davis is best known for his role in the LIBRA project, which was previously linked to Argentine President Javier Milei. The project drew headlines after allegations of mismanagement and connections to more than 20 hacks involving crypto theft in August 2023. Davis has also been connected to other celebrity-linked tokens, including the MELANIA and WOLF coins. In late August, a U.S. court unfroze 57.6 million USDC, restoring access to funds held by Davis and Meteora co-founder Ben Chow, both of whom were involved in promoting LIBRA. Insider Activity? Bubblemaps Connects the Dots According to Bubblemaps, multiple wallets received significant sums from centralized crypto exchanges just one day before the YZY token launch. After tracing the transfers, analysts discovered a cluster of wallets that appear to be connected to Davis through over-the-counter deals, shared deposits, and token sales. Although Bubblemaps cannot definitively say Davis was an insider, they reported that his wallet began buying YZY tokens just one minute after the official launch. The estimated net profit? $12 million. Some community members even speculate that Davis was directly behind the creation of the token.

He has sharply criticized a growing trend: companies leveraging debt to acquire Bitcoin. This strategy, often referred to as corporate Bitcoin debt , is seen by Jenkins as a perilous gamble, raising red flags reminiscent of past financial disasters. Understanding the Alarming Trend of Corporate Bitcoin Debt Patrick Jenkins, a respected voice from the Financial Times, didn’t mince words in his August 25 column. He labeled firms investing heavily in Bitcoin through borrowed capital as a “parade of fools.” His core concern revolves around businesses, particularly non-financial ones, raising capital via stocks or bonds primarily to buy Bitcoin. This approach fundamentally shifts a company’s risk profile. It moves away from traditional business operations towards speculative asset holding. The reliance on borrowed money amplifies potential losses. Jenkins highlights that this strategy is intrinsically linked to market overheating. It signals a dangerous level of optimism that could quickly turn sour. Echoes of Past Crises: Why is Corporate Bitcoin Debt Risky? Jenkins drew stark parallels between this trend and historical financial catastrophes. He specifically mentioned Ponzi schemes and the 2008 collateralized debt obligation (CDO) crisis. Why these comparisons? In both scenarios, an underlying asset’s value was inflated, often through complex financial instruments, leading to systemic risk. For companies accumulating corporate Bitcoin debt , the danger lies in: Leverage: Borrowing money to invest magnifies both gains and losses. Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is notoriously volatile, making it a high-risk asset for debt-funded investment. Speculative Nature: When a business model hinges on the continuous appreciation of a speculative asset, it becomes inherently unstable. This strategy, Jenkins argues, is not sustainable. It thrives on an “excessive optimism” that can quickly dissipate, leaving companies vulnerable. Navigating the “Crypto Winter” and Market Overheating with Corporate Bitcoin Debt Jenkins emphasized that the prevalence of corporate Bitcoin debt is a strong indicator of market overheating and speculative bubbles. When enthusiasm is high and prices are soaring, the temptation to jump in, even with borrowed funds, is immense. However, the crypto market is cyclical. History shows us that periods of intense growth are often followed by “crypto winters” – prolonged downturns where prices can plummet significantly. Companies heavily exposed to Bitcoin through debt would face immense pressure during such periods: Their assets (Bitcoin) would lose value rapidly. Their liabilities (debt) would remain, or even increase with interest. This could lead to severe financial distress, bankruptcies, and wider economic instability. The warning is clear: relying on continuous market uptrends for solvency is a dangerous game, especially when fueled by borrowed capital. What Companies Should Consider Before Embracing Corporate Bitcoin Debt Jenkins’ critique serves as a vital caution for any firm contemplating or currently engaged in leveraging debt for Bitcoin investments. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Risk Assessment: Conduct thorough due diligence on the extreme volatility of crypto assets. Understand the worst-case scenarios. Capital Structure: Evaluate if such speculative investments align with the company’s long-term financial health and shareholder interests. Is this truly part of your core business? Regulatory Scrutiny: Be aware that such strategies could attract increased regulatory attention and potential future restrictions, adding another layer of risk. Transparency: Clearly communicate investment strategies and associated risks to investors and stakeholders. Honesty builds trust. Ultimately, a prudent financial strategy prioritizes stability and sustainable growth over high-risk, speculative ventures fueled by borrowed capital. Ignoring these warnings could lead to severe repercussions. The Critical Takeaway on Corporate Bitcoin Debt Patrick Jenkins’ warning from the Financial Times is a powerful reminder that while innovation and new asset classes offer opportunities, they also carry significant risks. The allure of quick gains from Bitcoin can be strong, but when combined with the leverage of debt, it creates a volatile cocktail. Companies must exercise extreme caution and avoid the “parade of fools” by embracing sound financial principles. Ignoring these fundamental truths could lead to a painful reckoning when the market inevitably shifts. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is corporate Bitcoin debt? A1: Corporate Bitcoin debt refers to a strategy where companies raise capital, often through issuing stocks or bonds, primarily to invest that borrowed money into Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, rather than using it for core business operations or traditional investments. Q2: Why is the Financial Times editor concerned about this strategy? A2: Patrick Jenkins, deputy editor of the Financial Times, is concerned because he views it as a highly speculative and risky approach. He believes it resembles past financial bubbles and Ponzi schemes, where excessive optimism and leverage can lead to significant financial instability and potential losses when markets turn. Q3: What are the main risks associated with companies using debt to buy Bitcoin? A3: The main risks include exposure to Bitcoin’s extreme price volatility, amplified losses due to leverage (borrowed money), the speculative nature of the investment detached from core business models, and the potential for severe financial distress during crypto market downturns or “crypto winters.” Q4: How does this trend compare to past financial crises like the 2008 CDO crisis? A4: Jenkins draws parallels due to the reliance on inflated asset values and complex financial structures. In both cases, a perceived safe or continuously appreciating asset (subprime mortgages in 2008, Bitcoin here) is leveraged heavily, creating systemic risk if the asset’s value collapses. Q5: What should companies consider before engaging in corporate Bitcoin debt? A5: Companies should conduct thorough risk assessments of crypto volatility, evaluate if such investments align with their long-term financial health, be aware of potential regulatory scrutiny, and maintain transparent communication with stakeholders about their investment strategies and associated risks.

Some of the answers were balanced and expected, but at least one might surprise you. XRPUSD. Source: TradingView As Good as it Gets? The chart above paints a much clearer picture that we can describe in words. But, we will try briefly. XRP was range-bound for months and months ahead of the 2024 US Presidential elections, with a top of $0.6. Once it became known that the 45th US President would also be the 47th, Ripple’s token went ballistic. The first culmination was in January 2025, when it matched its 2018 ATH of $3.4. Although it failed there at first and corrected for the next several months, it finally broke above that coveted line in mid-July and set a new record of $3.65. Since then, however, it has struggled to maintain its run and now trades below $3, which is considered a key resistance-turned-support level that has now become resistance again. As such, we wondered whether this is just another correction before a late 2025 push to even fresher peaks, or if the $3.65 target will not be reached again this year. The three AIs in question, ChatGPT, Grok, and Gemini, made some interesting, educated speculations. OpenAI’s solution, for instance, also outlined the significance of the $3 level, which could spell further trouble if XRP remains below it: “The $3 mark remains a critical battleground. Repeated failures to break above this level and the shift of $3 from support to resistance raise concerns. Analysts are noticing a bearish descending triangle pattern and lower momentum indicators.” Grok and Gemini admitted that the overall market conditions have worsened in the past few days, and the lower trading volumes combined with the waning investor engagement “raise red flags about sustained bullish momentum.” ChatGPT highlighted another potential danger for riskier assets such as XRP. If the US Fed, which is expected to lower the interest rates in September, decides not to, then XRP and other altcoins could suffer. However, if Powell finally makes Trump happy with some rate reductions, Ripple’s token could greatly benefit, and here’s more on the matter . Not Over Yet Aside from the cautious outlook mentioned above, the 3 AIs also had a lot of positive things to say for the XRP bulls. ChatGPT cited projections from prominent institutions, such as Standard Chartered, which envision a price surge to $5.50 by year-end, if certain factors favor Ripple, including a friendly regulatory environment and ETF approvals. Some even more bullish predictions see the asset skyrocketing to $10 and beyond. However, the AI solution indicated that the odds of exceeding $5 this year are less than 20%. Gemini and Grok noted that the current retracement is a “healthy pullback” necessary for the market to flush out certain speculative traders after such a significant rally in July. The current consolidation around the $3 mark could be “building pressure for another upward move.” “Bullish Price Projections : Several analysts have very optimistic price targets for XRP in late 2025. Predictions range from $4.00 to $8.00, and some even suggest a potential for “parabolic growth” to much higher figures by the end of the year,” said Gemini. Grok noted that institutional and even retail demand could pick up quickly if the US SEC greenlights the spot XRP ETFs. So far, though, the US regulator has only delayed deciding on numerous filings, with the new deadlines set for October. “While the price has dropped from its recent high, many factors could contribute to future growth. The key is whether XRP can reclaim and hold the $3.00 level. If it does, and if positive catalysts like ETF approvals or new partnerships materialize, XRP could see another rally before the end of 2025. However, if it fails to break through this resistance, the price could remain in a more stable or even declining range. The future is uncertain, and both bullish and bearish scenarios have valid arguments,” concluded Gemini.

Traders are focusing on the $2.50–$3.00 range in the near term. They gave the prospect for $5 if ETF speculation. The Bearish Risk Factors There are also risks on the flip side which could drag XRP lower. Regulatory uncertainty remains the biggest wild card. Some bad news from the SEC case or new scrutiny from other regulators might spook investors. Broader macroeconomic conditions also pose a challenge. When interest rates are high, risk assets like crypto often get sold off. Recent blockchain payment solutions might threaten XRP. But with so many alternatives, it remains uncertain if they will do so. Some analysts, however, were worried whales could take the opportunity to lock in profits leading to sharp corrections. If the XRP market continues moving downward, it may test for support in the $0.80-$1 zone. The Rising Star Star in the Crypto World As XRP struggles at the crossroads, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the hottest name in altcoin. When people buy it early, they seem to be getting huge returns. Some analysts even predict 7,800% gains for early positions. Each presale round has sold out ever faster than the last, showing swelling investor confidence. As more and more people are hearing about MAGACOIN FINANCE, we are beginning to see it as a potential winner of this bull market. Conclusion: A Defining Moment Ahead XRP is at a pivotal stage. Given the ETF speculation, Ripple partnerships, and a potential legal resolution, bulls believe there is room for significant upside. But, regulatory threats, economic issues, and whale activity pose lingering risks. When making the investment decision, the investors have to weigh the gains and the risks. As XRP struggles to revert to the payments sector, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rising extremely fast, offering future investors a chance to indulge in this new digital currency.

Despite a 3% dip in the last 24 hours, institutional interest remains robust, as BitMine expanded its Ethereum treasury by over 190,000 ETH in just one week.. Market watchers are now eyeing a potential surge toward $5,000, while innovative DeFi projects like Ethena (ENA) and Remittix (RTX) are showing potential for 300% gains, attracting investors seeking high-growth opportunities beyond traditional ETH holdings. With institutional support and real-world utility driving market momentum, ETH price prediction remains bullish in the near term, offering a blend of stability and speculative upside. Ethereum Price Fundamentals ETH price prediction reflects the balance between short-term volatility and long-term growth. Over the last month, ETH has gained 23%, six-month gains reach 84% and five-year returns exceed 1,000%. Institutional interest remains strong, with BitMine expanding its Ethereum treasury to 1.71 million ETH, valued at $8.8 billion. Analysts argue that such accumulation offsets selling pressure and supports bullish trajectories. Technical factors influencing Ethereum include robust smart contract adoption, growth in DeFi projects and Layer 2 integrations that enhance scalability. ETH price prediction also depends on Bitcoin’s movements, as Ethereum often mirrors BTC’s volatility. While recent pullbacks capped rallies, short-term indicators point to renewed momentum with analysts expecting $5,000 to be tested in the coming days. Ethena (ENA) Emerges With Massive Gains Potential Ethena (ENA) is experiencing rapid growth as investors react to Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. ETH price prediction models often reference correlated altcoins like ENA, which has seen its Total Value Locked reach $12.025 billion. This surge in liquidity positions ENA for strong upward potential, with short-term targets near $0.85 and a technical breakout from a falling wedge confirming bullish momentum. Experts highlight Ethena’s sensitivity to macroeconomic policies, describing it as “the most leveraged asset to interest rate cuts.” This dynamic contributed to a 419% price increase during similar conditions in 2024, reinforcing optimism for potential gains of up to 300% in 2025. Technical indicators, including the Money Flow Index at 71.54 and Average Directional Index at 38.41, further support the bullish scenario. Remittix: A Utility Crypto With Adoption-Driven Upside Alongside ETH and ENA, utility-driven tokens like Remittix (RTX) are attracting investor attention for real-world adoption and infrastructure-based growth. RTX benefits from tangible use cases: sold over 620 million tokens, priced at $0.0987, raised over $21,5 million. Key catalysts include: Wallet beta launches this quarter (Q3 2025) Global payout rails already integrated and expanding Utility-first token powering real transaction volume Built for adoption, not speculation Ideal for freelancers, remitters and global earners Remittix’s platform enables crypto-to-bank transfers in 30+ countries and supports 40+ cryptocurrencies alongside 30 fiat currencies. This adoption-focused framework positions RTX as a practical alternative to purely speculative assets with analysts projecting significant upside alongside Ethereum’s next bullish leg. Market Outlook ETH price prediction remains bullish as institutional accumulation, DeFi growth and Layer 2 integration drive investor confidence. Simultaneously, altcoins like ENA and RTX present high-growth opportunities, offering potential 300% returns for early adopters. Traders should monitor Ethereum alongside macroeconomic trends and emerging utility cryptos to balance stability and high-upside exposure in their portfolios.

""The price momentum is weakening with the RSI close to the oversold zone and a bearish MACD,"" said Timothy Misir, head of research, BRN . ""The Spot CVD at –$199 million shows that sellers are in control with spot volume signaling a lack of demand bid. Conversely, Daily Active Addresses fell to 692K (below the low band), signaling weaker network participation."" The broader market remains under pressure with the CoinDesk 20 and CoinDesk 80 indices down 2% and 1.7% on a 24-hour basis. Derivatives Positioning Leveraged crypto bulls have been burned, with futures bets worth $940 million liquidated in the past 24 hours. More than $800 million were long positions betting on price gains. Ether alone accounted for $320 million in liquidations. Still, overall open interest (OI) in BTC remains elevated near lifetime highs above 740K BTC. In ether's case, the OI has pulled back to 14 million ETH from 14.60 million ETH. OI in SOL, XRP, DOGE, ADA, and LINK also dropped in the past 24 hours, indicating net capital outflows. Despite the price volatility, funding rates for most major tokens, excluding SHIB, ADA and SOL, remains positive to suggest dominance of bullish long positions. OI in the CME-listed standard BTC futures has fallen back to 137.3K from 145.2K, reversing the minor bounce from early this month. It shows that institutional interest in trading these regulated derivatives remains low. OI in options, however, has continued to increase, reaching its highest since late May, CME's ether futures OI remains elevated at 2.05 million ETH, just shy of the record 2.15 million ETH on Aug. 22. Meanwhile, OI in ether options is now at its highest since September last year. On Deribit, the impending multibillion-dollar expiry on Friday shows a bias towards BTC puts, indicative of concerns prices are set to drop further. The impending ether expiry paints a more balanced picture. Flows on the OTC desk at Paradigm have been mixed, featuring strategies such as outright put buying and put spreads in BTC, as well as calls and risk reversals in ETH. Token Talk Blue-chip NFT collections faced steep weekly losses as ether (ETH) pulled back from record highs, wiping more than 10% off the value of most top projects. Pudgy Penguins , the leading collection by trading volume, dropped 17% to a 10.32 ETH floor, showing that even the sector’s strongest liquidity magnet couldn’t escape the downturn. Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) lost 14.7% to 9.59 ETH, while Doodles recorded one of the sharpest corrections, falling 18.9% to 0.73 ETH. Secondary projects also slumped: Moonbirds fell 10.5%, and Lil Pudgys shed 14.6%, reflecting how price pressure cascaded across both flagship and derivative collections. CryptoPunks proved most resilient, losing just 1.35% over the week, underscoring its status as the market’s defensive benchmark when risk appetite collapses. Despite lower floors, trading activity stayed high. Pudgy Penguins saw 2,112 ETH ($9.36 million) in weekly volume, followed by Moonbirds (1,979 ETH), CryptoPunks (1,879 ETH), and BAYC (809 ETH). Overall NFT market capitalization shrank nearly 5% to $7.7 billion, down from a $9.3 billion peak on Aug. 13. The $1.6 billion drawdown highlights how quickly capital flees when ETH slumps. The sharp contrast between resilient CryptoPunks and sliding newer collections strengthens its appeal as a collateral asset. Its liquidity holds up even as broader NFT floors collapse. For investors, the sell-off signals that NFT blue chips remain high-beta ETH proxies, with only legacy projects like CryptoPunks showing the defensive value that makes them the safer long-term institutional bet.",Markets|Markets|market analysis|Derivatives|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|TRADING|MARKET|BTC,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-26 12:00:00

XRP, along with other cryptocurrencies, experienced a surge. While XRP’s price prediction continues to be a talking point, a new RWA token, Avalon X (AVLX) , is also gaining attention. It is a presale project with a futuristic utility that even showcases the potential to beat XRP in ROI. Will XRP Price Achieve its $10 Target? Ripple’s XRP token has long been promoted as a low-cost, high-speed bridge currency for international payments. So, after its recent surge above $3 and bullish technical breakouts, some analysts now peg XRP price’s potential at $5–$10 by late 2025. Credits: TradingView This optimism is backed by growing institutional interest (including new XRP futures ETFs and several bank partnerships) and positive regulatory developments (a pending SEC settlement that could clear XRP’s path). In fact, crypto media note that whales are accumulating XRP, and analysts forecast up to $10 in 2025 as a credible target. In short, XRP’s fundamentals: fast settlement, banking partnerships, and an improving legal outlook, support its optimistic price predictions. Why are Investors Interested in the Avalon X Presale? By contrast, Avalon X (AVLX) represents a very different crypto play. Backed by Grupo Avalon’s real estate projects, Avalon X is an RWA (real-world asset) utility token linking blockchain investors to physical property. Grupo Avalon has completed over $103M in sales and has townhouses, and other developments in its Dominican Republic project pipeline. Avalon X token holders earn utility perks: discounted stays at Avalon resorts, VIP access, curated experiences, and staking rewards. Importantly, AVLX is a fixed-supply, deflationary token. Only 2 billion tokens will ever exist, and 7% of the supply is earmarked for periodic burns to tighten supply over time. The project’s smart contracts are independently audited by top firms like CertiK , showcasing a focus on security. Early investors gain extra benefits through a tiered system: Gold, Diamond, and Platinum tiers offer escalating bonus tokens and raffle entries for tokens, and even an Eco Valley Townhouse. A promotional giveaway is going on on the Avalon X website. Ten winners each receive $100,000 in AVLX tokens, plus one buyer will actually win a built Avalon Eco Valley townhouse. Referrals grant extra entries. All these factors make Avalon X a spectacular presale project. It works in a growing market like real estate, has strong tokenomics, is backed by an established organization, and offers actual utility. The altcoin is currently available at just $0.005 in Stage 1. Which Offers Better Investment Potential: XRP or AVLX? Both XRP and Avalon X offer cryptocurrency exposure, but they work in very different ways and niches. XRP is fundamentally a financial/institutional project. It is a corporate-backed token for liquidity and payments. Avalon X, in contrast, is a lifestyle/asset-backed token. It ties each token to a slice of real estate value and consumer perks, not just market speculation. However, when it comes to a 100x ROI prospect, Avalon X shows strong potential with its innovation and tech.

Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Slowed By Old-School Whales, Analyst Warns According to CoinGlass, most of those losses came from long bets that could not weather the slide. Liquidations Hit Retail Traders Reports have disclosed that a single large sale helped set off the cascade. Selling pressure intensified as a large holder offloaded 24,000 BTC, triggering a wave of liquidations, said Rachael Lucas, a crypto analyst at BTC Markets. On Coinbase, Bitcoin briefly fell below $109,000 — its weakest level since July 9. Market participants felt the shock fast; traders who were long were the ones most exposed. Macro Signals And Market Reaction A recent hint from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at Jackson Hole about potential interest rate cuts changed how some investors priced risk. Since August 14, when Bitcoin reached an all-time high just over $124,000, the asset has corrected by over 10%. Based on data, the drop since Powell’s speech is about 7%. The single-day move was measured at close to 3% decline for Bitcoin, and total crypto market value slipped back below $4 trillion to about $3.83 trillion as almost $200 billion flowed out of the space. Ether Is Holding Up Ether traded near $4,340 and, for now, looks steadier than Bitcoin. It did fall, but it did not breach last week’s low. Institutional interest in Ether remains a talking point. According to Lucas, institutions continue to focus on Ethereum, even as traders reassess risk across smaller coins. Related Reading: Solana Extends Streak, Outshines Ethereum in DEX Volume – Details Altcoins Took Bigger Hits Many smaller tokens fell harder than the majors. Solana, Dogecoin, Cardano, Chainlink, and Sui were among the worst hit. That pushed losses beyond the headline Bitcoin numbers and left traders in altcoin-heavy positions nursing larger drawdowns. Thin weekend liquidity served to enhance the price gyrations, making the action more extreme than it would have been on a more active trading day. September’s Track Record And Outlook There is also a historical component to the tale. September has a history of strong pullbacks in bull markets, with strong corrections in 2017 and 2021.

50706840,565286,1756209610,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50706840.jpeg,Ethereum Is Outperforming And Beating Bitcoin In This Key Metric,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-is-outperforming-bitcoin/,"While Bitcoin’s price faced heightened bearish pressure in the last few days, Ethereum’s price experienced significant upside action, which led to a new all-time high during the weekend. In addition to outperforming Bitcoin in terms of price action, ETH is demonstrating notable on-chain activity when compared to BTC. Bitcoin Is Lagging Behind Ethereum Ethereum’s strength is becoming increasingly evident in the current bull market cycle, with new on-chain data highlighting its edge over Bitcoin. CryptoMe, a market expert, has outlined a key metric that underscores the disparity in momentum between the two crypto giants in a quick-take post on the CryptoQuant platform. According to the market expert, Ethereum is giving strong signals compared to Bitcoin, as Wall Street is starting to adopt the altcoin. Considering the trend, ETH fundamentals appear to be painting a clear picture of resilience and market dominance. In the last 3 months, ETH has outperformed, and this disparity may continue for some time. CryptoMe’s analysis is based on a comparison of the Open Interest (OI) data for Bitcoin and Ethereum futures contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). Delving into BTC’s performance, the expert highlighted that Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $110,000 in January, then fell to $74,000 in March and April before rising to $124,000 for a new all-time high. However, the open interest did not retest its old levels during this period. Therefore, even if the price of Bitcoin increased, it would not be able to draw the same amount of institutional interest as CME options. Meanwhile, the circumstances are different for ETH. In 2024, ETH made several attempts to break past the $4,000 mark, but failed each time due to its weak open interest. However, CryptoMe noted that the open interest in CME has started to increase in this current trend. The development implies that the ongoing uptrend is bolstered by fresh liquidity inflows and shows that the altcoin is diverging from Bitcoin . ETH Rallies To New Highs: The Top Is Not In ETH may have risen sharply to new highs, but CryptoMe foresees a continued uptrend due to the absence of retail investors on centralized exchanges . Typically, retail investors enter close to the top and give the major players exit liquidity. Nonetheless, since retail is still absent in the current move, it shows that ETH’s price action is healthy and has room to grow. In the overall picture, ETH is showing a more bullish outlook compared to BTC lately. According to the market expert, the increase in CME open interest and the absence of retail participation indicate that this disparity might persist in the near to medium future. At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $4,414, demonstrating a nearly 5% in the last 24 hours. Despite the waning price action, CoinMarketCap data reveals that investors’ sentiment is slowly turning bullish, as evidenced by a more than 10% increase in trading volume in the past day.",Ethereum|bitcoin|btc|Chicago Mercantile Exchange|CME|Coinmarketcap|CryptoMe|CryptoQuant|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|Ethereum Fundamentals|ethereum news|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT|open interest,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|BTC|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-26 12:00:10

50707662,https://coinedition.com/?p=704606,1756209694,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/7/default.png,Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Prediction for August 27,https://coinedition.com/dogecoin-doge-price-prediction-for-august-27-2025/,"The Dogecoin price today is trading at $0.210, consolidating inside a broad symmetrical triangle that has guided August’s action. The structure is tightening with higher lows meeting descending resistance near $0.226. This compression suggests a breakout is approaching, with $0.226 as the first upside pivot and $0.206 as the immediate base to defend. What’s Happening With Dogecoin’s Price? DOGE price dynamics (Source: TradingView) On the daily chart, DOGE is holding the $0.21 zone, aligning with the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement at $0.218. Repeated rebounds from this level confirm strong buyer interest, though overhead resistance at $0.226 (Fib 0.382) has capped every rally attempt this month. Above this, the next hurdles sit at $0.238 (Fib 0.5) and $0.249 (Fib 0.618). DOGE price dynamics (Source: TradingView) Volume Profile analysis highlights heavy trading around $0.23, making this a key supply band. If DOGE clears it, the path opens toward the broader $0.26–$0.29 resistance pocket. On the downside, $0.20 remains the structural line in the sand, with deeper support at $0.188.

50707226,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=792554,1756209696,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50707226.jpeg,Trump pressures Fed and trade partners as emerging markets stocks and currencies fall,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/em-stocks-currencies-plunge-trump-fed-trade/,"Emerging markets plunged on Tuesday as President Donald Trump dialed up pressure on the Federal Reserve and reignited multiple trade fights at once. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index fell by 0.9%, snapping a rally that had lifted it to levels not seen in over three years. Traders exited risk positions, especially in Asia , after Trump targeted technology exports, Fed leadership, and tariff policy all in the same breath. The downturn was led by big names Alibaba Group Holding and Tencent Holdings, dropping sharply after Trump threatened new tariffs and export restrictions on semiconductors and other advanced technology linked to China. Last night, Trump fired Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, escalating his efforts to gain control over the U.S. central bank. This came just weeks after Adriana Kugler stepped down, leaving one board seat vacant. The removal of Cook would shrink the Fed to five members. But if Trump installs Stephen Miran in the open seat and removes Cook, he’d control four of seven board votes. Trump adds tariffs and pressures central bank at once The pressure didn’t stop there. Trump is pushing forward with a 25% tariff on Indian imports tied to Russian oil transactions, set to begin Wednesday. At the same time, South Korea is under U.S. pressure to uphold an earlier tariff agreement, which includes a 15% levy on South Korean goods and hundreds of billions of dollars in U.S. investments. Despite President Lee Jae Myung personally raising the issue during his first meeting with Trump, no deal was struck to ease the burden. The effect spread fast. The MSCI gauge for developing currencies dropped 0.3%, with the South Korean won and Taiwan’s dollar taking the hardest hits. Strategists at Credit Agricole, led by Sebastien Barbe, said in a note: “While markets have started to pare optimism after the Jackson Hole symposium, Donald Trump’s announcement that he would remove Fed Governor Lisa Cook from her position has further suppressed risk sentiment in Asia today.” Meanwhile, China responded differently. Beijing is sending a senior trade negotiator to the U.S., signaling that talks between the world’s two largest economies could resume after both sides paused their last major trade dispute. But beyond the gesture, no terms or timeline were made public. Bond yields react as markets pull back Back in Washington, Trump’s decision to move against Lisa Cook triggered a reaction in the bond market. The U.S. Treasury yield curve steepened. The 2-year yield dropped nearly 2 basis points to 3.71%, while the 10-year yield rose to 4.296%. The 30-year yield increased even more, by 4 basis points, hitting 4.9%. Traders reacted quickly to the reshuffling threat at the Fed. And while prices and yields always move in opposite directions, the trend was clear: investors expect more long-term inflation risk or policy change. The Fed board currently has six sitting members. Removing Lisa Cook would drop that to five, still with a majority of non-Trump appointees. But if Stephen Miran is confirmed and Fed Chair Jerome Powell steps down after his term ends in May, Trump could appoint a fifth member, giving him full voting control of the board. Markets responded across the board. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 56 points (0.1%), while S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures each dropped by 0.1%. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a mix of major global currencies, slipped by 0.2%. Outside of the U.S., Hungary’s central bank, the National Bank of Hungary, held its main rate at 6.5% Tuesday, opting for currency stability over early easing. That level remains tied with Romania for the highest policy rate in the European Union.

This move, described by officials as part of a broader strategy to establish a sovereign wealth fund, signals a shift toward deeper government involvement in private enterprise. Against this backdrop, Watcher.Guru posted , “JUST IN: US Government to take ownership in more companies.” The news quickly drew the attention of the XRP community, where speculation turned to Ripple’s large escrow holdings of XRP. Zach Rector’s Comment on Ripple’s Escrow In reply to Watcher.Guru’s announcement, Zach Rector wrote , “I wonder if they would like some XRP from Ripple’s escrow too?” The remark drew attention to the substantial reserves of XRP held in Ripple’s escrow accounts, which have long been a focal point of debate regarding market supply and control. Rector’s comment pointed to a scenario in which government ownership ambitions might not remain confined to traditional corporations but could potentially include interests tied to digital assets. I wonder if they would like some XRP from Ripple’s escrow too? https://t.co/fWdx607Ckw — Zach Rector (@ZachRector7) August 25, 2025 Community Reactions to the Comment Members of the community shared their views on Rector’s statement. Vincent wrote , “Government involvement in ripple would be very bad so let’s hope not they will put sanctions like can’t deal with China and god knows who else so I think that’s a very very bad idea and we should hope that isn’t the case.” His reaction reflected concerns that direct government involvement in Ripple could trigger international restrictions, possibly hindering the company’s ability to expand globally. Another user, SikeNawG, framed the issue through the lens of the Ripple versus SEC case , stating , “Shyt i thought that was the entire point of the Ripple vs SEC court case, using Gary as a Big-Banker’s Puppet just for that reason, delay innovation, discourage newcomers and get a piece of the pie!” This response suggested that regulatory action may have been designed not only for oversight but also to slow industry growth and ensure that larger institutions or the government itself could secure influence in the sector.

The comments from community members underscored concerns about the potential consequences of such involvement, ranging from the risk of sanctions to the possibility of innovation being deliberately slowed to favor institutional control. With the U.S. government now actively pursuing ownership stakes in major corporations, questions remain about whether similar strategies could one day extend into the cryptocurrency space. As policy shifts unfold, the future relationship between government ownership and digital assets will remain a critical area of attention.

This future is rapidly approaching, thanks to pioneers like VersaBank USA, which has just launched a groundbreaking pilot program for tokenized deposits in the United States. This initiative marks a significant step forward, aiming to test the stability and utility of these innovative financial instruments. As the U.S. subsidiary of Canadian digital bank VersaBank, this move positions them at the forefront of digital banking evolution, potentially reshaping how we view and utilize our money. What Exactly Are Tokenized Deposits ? At its core, a tokenized deposit is a digital representation of actual cash held by a regulated financial institution. In VersaBank’s case, they call these Digital Deposit Receipts (DDRs). Essentially, a DDR is a digital token that is pegged 1:1 to a real-world cash deposit. For example, their USDVB is a U.S. dollar version, meaning one USDVB token always equals one U.S. dollar. This direct peg ensures stability and trust, as the underlying asset is a verifiable cash deposit, not a volatile cryptocurrency. The bank issues these tokens, making them a direct liability of the bank, much like a traditional deposit. How Do They Differ from Stablecoins? You might be wondering how tokenized deposits compare to stablecoins. While both aim for price stability, a crucial difference lies in their issuer and regulatory framework. Stablecoins are typically issued by private companies in the cryptocurrency market and are backed by various assets, which can sometimes lead to transparency and regulatory concerns. Conversely, tokenized deposits are issued directly by regulated banks. This means they operate within existing banking regulations and benefit from the established trust and oversight of financial institutions. This inherent regulatory clarity and institutional backing provide a higher level of security and confidence for users. VersaBank USA’s Pioneering Pilot: Unpacking USDVB On August 26, VersaBank USA announced the launch of its pilot program for tokenized deposits . The primary goal of this pilot is to thoroughly test the stability and functionality of USDVB, their U.S. dollar-pegged DDR. This practical application allows the bank to assess real-world performance and identify any areas for optimization. The pilot program is a crucial step towards broader adoption. By meticulously evaluating the system’s robustness, VersaBank ensures that their tokenized deposits can meet the stringent demands of modern finance. This hands-on approach reflects a commitment to innovation while maintaining the highest standards of financial integrity. What Benefits Do These Digital Receipts Offer? The advantages of DDRs are compelling and multifaceted. VersaBank highlights several key benefits: Improved Efficiency: By leveraging blockchain technology, transactions can be processed faster and with fewer intermediaries. Reduced Costs: The streamlined nature of blockchain-based transfers can significantly lower operational expenses for both banks and users. Enhanced Security: The inherent cryptographic security of blockchain provides a robust defense against fraud and unauthorized access. Superior Asset: VersaBank suggests that the high level of security and regulatory backing could make DDRs a more reliable and trusted asset compared to many existing stablecoins. These benefits are not just theoretical; they promise tangible improvements for businesses and individuals alike, offering a glimpse into a more agile and secure financial ecosystem. The Future Landscape: Opportunities and Hurdles for Tokenized Deposits The introduction of tokenized deposits opens up a world of possibilities for the financial sector. Imagine real-time settlement of transactions, programmable money that executes payments automatically based on predefined conditions, and seamless integration with decentralized finance (DeFi) applications within a regulated environment. These innovations could unlock unprecedented levels of financial fluidity and control. However, the journey isn’t without its challenges. Regulatory clarity across different jurisdictions remains a key hurdle. Furthermore, achieving widespread adoption requires educating the public and ensuring interoperability with existing financial systems. Overcoming these obstacles will be vital for tokenized deposits to realize their full potential and truly transform the banking landscape. VersaBank USA’s pilot program represents a bold step into the future of banking. By combining the stability of traditional deposits with the innovation of blockchain technology, tokenized deposits like USDVB offer a secure, efficient, and potentially revolutionary way to handle digital cash. This development not only highlights VersaBank’s pioneering spirit but also signals a broader shift in how financial institutions are embracing digital assets. The journey has just begun, and the implications for a more connected and efficient financial world are truly exciting. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the main difference between tokenized deposits and stablecoins? A: The primary difference is the issuer and regulatory oversight. Tokenized deposits are issued by regulated banks and backed by actual cash deposits, operating within traditional banking frameworks. Stablecoins are typically issued by private crypto companies and backed by various assets, often with less direct regulatory oversight. Q2: Is USDVB a cryptocurrency? A: While USDVB uses blockchain technology, it is a tokenized deposit , not a cryptocurrency in the traditional sense. It represents a bank-issued liability, directly pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar held by VersaBank USA, making it a digital form of cash rather than a speculative asset. Q3: What are the key benefits of using tokenized deposits? A: Key benefits include improved efficiency for transactions, reduced operational costs, enhanced security through blockchain technology, and the stability and trust that come from being issued by a regulated financial institution. Q4: Will tokenized deposits replace traditional bank accounts? A: It’s unlikely they will completely replace traditional bank accounts in the near future. Instead, tokenized deposits are more likely to complement existing banking services, offering new functionalities and efficiencies for specific types of transactions and financial activities, especially in wholesale and institutional settings initially. Q5: How does VersaBank ensure the stability of its tokenized deposits? A: VersaBank ensures stability by pegging its DDRs, like USDVB, 1:1 to actual cash deposits held at the bank. This means for every USDVB token issued, there is a corresponding U.S. dollar held in reserve, providing a direct and transparent backing.

Ronghui Gu, professor of computer science at Columbia University and co-founder of CertiK, said the industry is in an “asymmetric conflict with cybercriminals.” He mentioned that attackers only need to find one flaw to cause major damage, while defenders must secure millions of lines of code across decentralized protocols. “As long as there’s a weak point or some vulnerabilities out there, sooner or later they will be discovered by these attackers,” Gu said during a Chain Reaction space on X held last Friday. “So it’s an endless war.” The CertiK co-founder said that cybersecurity defenses are improving by the day, but hackers have become more sophisticated. He further warned that the value of digital assets stolen in 2026 could still hit the billion-dollar level. Hack3d report: Billions stolen in first half of 2025 In its latest Hack3d report released Tuesday, CertiK estimated that $2.4 billion was lost across 344 incidents during the first half of 2025. Wallet compromise was the most damaging type of attack, with 34 incidents leading to more than $1.7 billion in losses. Phishing ranked second in total value stolen, with attackers netting more than $410 million across 132 incidents. Although wallet compromises resulted in the highest financial losses, phishing accounted for the largest number of attacks so far this year. CertiK said Ethereum is the primary target for hackers, having suffered 175 incidents in the first six months of the year, leading to more than $1.6 billion in losses from hacks, scams, and exploits. The report also showed that only a fraction of stolen funds were recovered. Of the nearly $2.5 billion lost, just $187 million was returned, leaving adjusted total losses of more than $2.28 billion. On average, each security incident caused $7.1 million in losses, though the median loss per case was significantly lower at $89,026. Much to the relief of the crypto community facing the staggering theft totals, CertiK reported that losses declined in the second quarter of 2025. A total of $801 million was stolen across 144 incidents, 52.1% less in value than the year’s first quarter. The number of cases also fell, with 59 fewer incidents reported. Phishing was still the leading attack vector in the second quarter, responsible for nearly $395 million in losses from 52 cases. Code vulnerabilities followed, with almost $236 million lost across 47 incidents. CertiK: Hackers take advantage of human nature Gu told listeners that even though every protocol is working to strengthen their defenses, attackers are turning to weaknesses in human behavior. He propounded that hackers exploit psychological loopholes to bypass technological barriers. “Let’s say that your protocol or layer 1 blockchain becomes more secure,” Gu said. “Then they may target human beings behind it. The people who have the private key and so on.” CertiK’s analysis of 2024 found that nearly half of all security incidents in the crypto industry were linked to operational ties such as private key compromises. This year, hackers have been using social engineering techniques to trick victims into clicking fraudulent links or signing malicious transactions, which can expose private keys and drain wallets. Coinbase was among the crypto businesses that fell to a social engineering scam, which saw them lose over $300 million, Cryptopolitan revealed in May.

The firm seeks to raise $1.25 billion to establish the public vehicle designed to accumulate Solana tokens as a treasury asset. According to The Information, Pantera Capital plans to begin with a $500 million raise, followed by $750 million through warrants. The California-based firm argued that DATs can generate yield to grow net asset value per share, which results in more token ownership over time compared to just holding tokens. Pantera Capital deploys over $300M in treasury companies Pantera Capital revealed in its disclosure earlier this month that it has already deployed over $300 million in treasury companies across different digital assets and countries. The firm has invested in DATs across the U.S., the UK, and Israel, with a token portfolio including BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, TON, Sui, Ethena, and Hyperliquid. The company also mentioned that the most important element of a DAT’s success is the long-term investment merit of the underlying token. According to Pantera’s blockchain letter, its DAT portfolio includes stakes in Twenty One Capital, DeFi Development Corp, Sharplink Gaming, and BitMine Immersion (BNMR). The venture capital firm acknowledged that it first invested its Pantera DAT Fund into BNMR because it had a clear strategic roadmap. The company highlighted BNMR’s chair, Tom Lee’s long-term vision of acquiring 5% of the total ETH supply. At the time of publication, on-chain data shows that the total value of public Solana treasuries is more than $695 million, representing around 0.7% of SOL’s total supply. Pantera’s initiative to establish Solana Co. to hold SOL as a corporate treasury asset would eclipse that figure. “The impact will not be just about size, but more about symbolism. This would give the market an impression that Solana is moving beyond being a retail-driven chain to one with credible institutional sponsorship at scale.” -Shawn Young, Chief Analyst at MEXC Research. Young also believes that the prospect of one company holding such an outsized Solana reserve would usher in a new layer of risk in the industry. He argued that it could alter how Solana trades in the case of narrowing free float and potentially increasing volatility. The analyst also sees a similar scenario in Bitcoin treasury firms, such as Strategy , which have drawn attention and credibility for legitimizing digital assets. He also noted that such BTC treasury companies have created a scenario where one corporate balance sheet has disproportionate influence on the narrative. The hedge fund company’s proposed fundraising is still in the early planning stages and subject to regulatory approval. Pantera Capital’s initiative follows a series of smaller Nasdaq-listed firms that have pivoted into Solana treasuries.

The initiative is expected to close on August 28, with investments from ParaFi Capital and Pantera Capital. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan, the firm aims to become the largest Solana digital asset treasury, surpassing companies like Upexi and DeFi Development, which currently hold $370 million and $199 million SOL, respectively. Sharp Technology’s CIO, Alice Zhang, believes there’s an acceleration in global adoption of Solana as it continues to receive institutional support as a digital asset treasury strategy. DeFi Development revealed in July that it had doubled its holdings to more than 163,000 SOL worth around $21 million. The firm launched a $125 million equity offering on August 25, priced at $12.50 per share. The company’s CEO, Joseph Onorati, said DeFi Development seeks to acquire as much SOL as possible in a way that compounds value per share for its investors. Classover also purchased about 6,500 SOL in June following its Solana accumulation strategy. The firm’s initiative follows its initial plan backed by a $500 million convertible note program dedicated to acquiring and staking SOL.

South Korea is making significant strides in its approach to virtual assets. The nation’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) is actively preparing the next phase of its South Korea crypto bill , a crucial piece of legislation slated for discussion during the National Assembly’s regular session in September. What’s Next for the South Korea Crypto Bill? The announcement came directly from FSC Chairman Kim Byung-hwan. He confirmed this during the second meeting of the National Assembly’s National Policy Committee. Responding to a question from Democratic Party lawmaker Min Byeong-deok, Chairman Kim assured that the second-phase virtual asset legislation would be ready for debate in September. This statement signals a determined effort by South Korea to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for its rapidly evolving digital asset market. Previously, the initial phase of crypto regulation in South Korea primarily focused on anti-money laundering (AML) measures. It also established requirements for the registration of virtual asset service providers (VASPs). However, the industry has expanded rapidly since then, introducing new complexities and innovative products. Therefore, a more robust and detailed regulatory approach is now essential. Why is Phase Two of the South Korea Crypto Bill So Important? The upcoming South Korea crypto bill represents a pivotal step towards solidifying the country’s stance on virtual assets. Its primary goal is to create a more stable and transparent environment for both investors and businesses alike. This second phase is expected to delve deeper into areas not fully covered by the initial regulations, addressing gaps and future-proofing the market. Consider these key reasons for its immense importance: Enhanced Investor Protection: The bill will likely introduce stronger safeguards for individual investors. This aims to address persistent concerns about market manipulation, fraud, and opaque practices within the crypto space. Clearer Market Guidelines: It will provide much-needed clarity for crypto exchanges, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, and other virtual asset businesses operating within South Korea. This clarity can foster responsible innovation while ensuring strict compliance. Addressing Emerging Technologies: With the rapid rise of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), stablecoins, and the broader DeFi ecosystem, new legislation must adapt to these advancements. The bill will aim to regulate these novel aspects effectively, preventing regulatory arbitrage. Global Harmonization: South Korea is a major player in the global crypto scene. The nation is keen to align its regulations with international standards, ensuring its market remains competitive, secure, and integrated with global financial systems. What Specifics Might the New South Korea Crypto Bill Cover? While specific details of the phase two South Korea crypto bill are yet to be fully disclosed, industry experts anticipate several key areas will be thoroughly addressed. These could significantly impact how virtual assets are perceived and utilized. Potential areas of focus include: DeFi Regulation: How will decentralized finance protocols be categorized and regulated?

They anticipate the U.S. Federal Reserve will begin implementing Fed rate cuts as early as September. This forecast suggests a shift in monetary policy that could have profound implications for markets, businesses, and everyday consumers. Understanding these potential changes is crucial for anyone navigating the current economic landscape. Morgan Stanley’s Bold Forecast for Fed Rate Cuts According to a report by Walter Bloomberg, Morgan Stanley’s economists project a clear timeline for the upcoming Fed rate cuts . The firm expects an initial reduction of 25 basis points in September. Following this, they foresee another cut in December. This isn’t just a short-term outlook. Morgan Stanley extends its forecast, projecting quarterly reductions of 25 basis points through the end of 2026. This consistent approach would ultimately bring the federal funds target rate to a range between 2.75% and 3.0%. Initial Cut: A 25 basis point reduction is expected in September. Second Cut: Another 25 basis point reduction is projected for December. Long-Term Plan: Quarterly 25 basis point cuts are anticipated until Q4 2026. Projected Target Rate: The target rate is forecast to reach 2.75% to 3.0% by the end of 2026. Why Are Fed Rate Cuts So Important for the Economy? You might wonder, why do these anticipated Fed rate cuts matter so much? Interest rate adjustments by the Federal Reserve are powerful tools that influence the entire economy. When the Fed lowers rates, it generally makes borrowing cheaper for banks, which then translates to lower interest rates for consumers and businesses. Cheaper loans can stimulate economic activity. For instance, mortgage rates might drop, encouraging home buying. Businesses could find it less expensive to invest in expansion, potentially leading to job creation. However, the timing and magnitude of these Fed rate cuts are always closely watched, as they also reflect the Fed’s assessment of inflation and economic growth. Navigating the Market Ahead of Potential Fed Rate Cuts The prospect of significant Fed rate cuts presents both opportunities and challenges. Investors often react to these predictions, leading to market volatility. Understanding the potential impact can help individuals and businesses prepare. Potential Benefits: Lower Borrowing Costs: Mortgages, car loans, and credit card interest rates could decrease. Stimulated Spending: Consumers might feel more confident to spend and invest. Business Growth: Companies can access capital more cheaply, fostering expansion. Equity Market Boost: Lower rates often make stocks more attractive compared to bonds. Potential Challenges: Reduced Savings Returns: Interest earned on savings accounts and Certificates of Deposit (CDs) might fall. Inflation Concerns: Aggressive cuts could, in some scenarios, reignite inflation if not managed carefully. Market Volatility: Uncertainty surrounding the Fed’s decisions can lead to short-term market swings. What Could Influence Future Federal Reserve Rate Cuts? The Federal Reserve’s decisions are not set in stone. They are highly dependent on incoming economic data and evolving conditions. Key factors that will influence the actual implementation and pace of these Fed rate cuts include: Inflation Data: The Fed’s primary goal is price stability. If inflation remains stubbornly high, rate cuts could be delayed. Employment Figures: A strong job market might give the Fed more leeway, while a weakening one could accelerate cuts. GDP Growth: Economic growth indicators provide insight into the overall health of the economy. Global Economic Trends: International events and economic performance can also play a role in the Fed’s considerations. Morgan Stanley’s forecast offers a detailed roadmap, but the Federal Reserve will ultimately make its decisions based on its dual mandate: maximizing employment and maintaining price stability. Therefore, keeping an eye on these economic indicators is vital. In conclusion, Morgan Stanley’s prediction of consistent Fed rate cuts starting in September signals a potential shift towards a more accommodative monetary policy. While this could bring relief to borrowers and stimulate economic growth, it also requires careful consideration for savers and investors. Staying informed about the Federal Reserve’s actions and the broader economic landscape remains paramount for making sound financial decisions in the months and years ahead. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are Fed rate cuts? Fed rate cuts refer to decisions by the U.S. Federal Reserve to lower the target range for the federal funds rate. This action typically makes borrowing cheaper across the economy, aiming to stimulate economic growth. When does Morgan Stanley expect the first Fed rate cut? Morgan Stanley anticipates the first Fed rate cut of 25 basis points to occur in September, followed by another in December. How will Fed rate cuts affect consumers? For consumers, Fed rate cuts could lead to lower interest rates on mortgages, car loans, and credit cards, making borrowing more affordable. However, returns on savings accounts and CDs might also decrease. What is a basis point? A basis point (bp) is a common unit of measure in finance, equal to one-hundredth of a percentage point. So, a 25 basis point cut means a 0.25% reduction in interest rates. What is the projected target rate by 2026? Morgan Stanley projects that through quarterly Fed rate cuts , the federal funds target rate will reach a range between 2.75% and 3.0% by the end of 2026.

The exchange’s latest analysis indicates that while Ethereum has reached new all-time highs above $4,950, significant capital rotation into higher-risk altcoins awaits the introduction of new investment vehicles and renewed Bitcoin momentum. Current Market Conditions Favor Institutional Concentration Over Retail Speculation The Altcoin Season Index currently sits at 45 out of 100, firmly in “Bitcoin Season” territory despite recent altcoin strength. Source: CMC The metric reached a yearly high of 87 in December 2024 during peak altcoin performance, but has remained subdued throughout 2025 as institutional flows concentrate in Bitcoin and Ethereum products. Bitfinex Alpha’s August 25 report highlights Ethereum’s outperformance following Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s dovish Jackson Hole remarks, which sparked a broad-based short squeeze across digital assets. Ethereum surged to fresh all-time highs while Bitcoin consolidated in a range-bound pattern between $111,000 and $123,640. Source: CoinGecko Corporate treasury accumulation continues driving Ethereum strength, with companies like BitMine and SharpLink Gaming expanding holdings beyond $10 billion collectively. However, this institutional demand remains concentrated in established assets rather than spreading across the broader altcoin ecosystem that would signal a traditional altseason. ETF Flows Create Structural Headwinds for Altcoin Rally Bitcoin ETFs experienced $1.18 billion in net outflows over the past week, while Ethereum ETFs lost $197 million in a single day, marking the second-largest daily exit on record. ETF flows have emerged as the marginal buyer and seller for both major cryptocurrencies, creating volatility that institutional investors seek to avoid in smaller altcoins. Among the notable developments Bitfinex pointed to is the CFTC’s expansion of its “Crypto Sprint” initiative to advance U.S. digital asset regulation, accepting public comments until October 20 to shape rules on leveraged and retail crypto trading beyond spot contracts. The next phase aims to focus on inter-agency coordination with the SEC on registration, custody, and trading requirements for a unified federal framework. Without regulatory approval for altcoin ETFs, institutional capital remains trapped in Bitcoin and Ethereum products. This structural limitation prevents the broad-based capital rotation historically associated with altseasons, when retail and institutional funds flow into smaller cryptocurrencies seeking higher returns. Similarly, the report highlighted the Thailand launch of an 18-month pilot crypto-to-baht program allowing foreign tourists to convert cryptocurrencies into local currency. Thailand launches crypto-to-baht payment system for tourists starting August 18 through TouristDigiPay scheme targeting tourism recovery amid declining Chinese visitors. #Thailand #Crypto https://t.co/jXinkILnRn — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 17, 2025 Still, the initiative focuses on established tokens rather than promoting altcoin adoption. Conversion caps of approximately $16,950 per tourist suggest regulatory caution around broader crypto acceptance. The realized cap growth for Bitcoin has slowed significantly compared to previous all-time high breakouts. Current monthly expansion peaked at 6% versus 13% during late-2024’s $100,000 breakthrough, which resulted from the softer risk appetite among institutional investors who drive altcoin cycles. Technical and Fundamental Factors Support Delayed Altseason Timeline Market analysts note that true altcoin seasons historically begin only after Ethereum establishes decisive breaks above all-time highs. The 2021 altcoin surge occurred after Ethereum’s third attempt at breaking previous records, triggering massive capital flows into assets like Cardano, which gained 400% in one month. Source: X/@Whale_AI_net Current market dynamics mirror early 2021 conditions, with the OTHERS/ETH ratio at multi-year lows similar to the oversold setup that preceded the three-month rally when Solana gained 1,200%, Avalanche rose 1,400%, and Axie Infinity surged 15,000%. However, regulatory infrastructure for altcoin investment vehicles remains undeveloped. As a result, Tim Draper, founding partner of Draper Associates, argued that altcoins ultimately serve as beta testers for Bitcoin improvements, with successful innovations eventually ported to the dominant network. Source: YouTube He noted that Bitcoin’s market share has increased from 40% to over 60% across multiple cycles, indicating a growing gravitational pull toward the leading cryptocurrency. However, Electric Capital data contradicts this narrative, showing only 2,583 total developers working on Bitcoin compared to 12,931 on the EVM stack and 9,094 on Ethereum. Source: Electric Capital While this data shows venture capital and institutional interest in DeFi protocols, Layer-1 alternatives, and specialized applications continue to grow, it lacks direct investment vehicles comparable to Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Until regulators approve broader crypto ETF categories, altseason catalysts remain limited to retail speculation rather than institutional adoption. As it stands now, the regulatory constraints, concentrated institutional flows, and Bitcoin’s range-bound behavior create conditions favoring continued Ethereum strength while delaying broader altcoin participation. Significant capital rotation into higher-risk assets is needed to renew Bitcoin momentum and expand investment vehicle availability beyond current BTC/ETH products.

Bearish divergences on RSI suggest that buyers may be losing strength, raising the risk of a corrective phase unless ETH can reclaim its highs with conviction. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart On the daily chart, ETH broke slightly above its previous peak, recording a marginally higher ATH. However, the RSI failed to make a new high, forming a bearish divergence that reflects waning momentum. Following this, the asset pulled back toward the ascending channel’s midline, now finding support in the $4,400–$4,450 region. If this level holds, ETH may consolidate before another retest of the $4.9K zone. Conversely, a breakdown below $4,400 would expose the $4K support range, which aligns with a prior swing high and marks the next major demand area. Overall, Ethereum is trading within a tight and dynamic range, and a decisive breakout in either direction is likely to trigger an impulsive move. The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, ETH recently performed a liquidity sweep above $4.8K, only to reverse sharply. This rejection coincided with distribution in the Bitcoin market, confirming short-term exhaustion across majors. Ethereum has since retraced to the $4.4K Fibonacci cluster (0.618–0.702 retracement), where it currently hovers above trendline support. This confluence zone is a critical battleground. While holding above $4.4K could fuel a retest of the $4.9K highs, losing this level would likely open the door for a deeper correction toward $4K. Onchain Analysis By ShayanM Ethereum has experienced extreme volatility in August, marked by sharp rallies followed by equally aggressive reversals. The liquidation heatmap sheds light on where leveraged long and short positions are clustered, highlighting the levels that act as liquidity magnets for the price action. During its surge toward $4.9K, ETH triggered a dense cluster of short liquidations, wiping out aggressive sellers. However, the sharp rejection that followed signaled exhaustion at those highs, trapping late buyers in the process. At present, the heatmap reveals two critical liquidity zones: Upside: Above $4.9K, where untested short liquidations remain stacked, providing a magnet if bullish momentum regains strength. Downside: Below $4K, where dense clusters of long liquidations could attract price action if the $4.2K support fails to hold. Currently, ETH is consolidating within a liquidity-driven range between $4.2K and $4.9K. With significant liquidity pools positioned on both sides, the market remains highly vulnerable to sharp, leverage-fueled moves, as liquidity hunts continue to dominate short-term dynamics.

Together with Phoenix Group , a UAE-listed miner that Arkham tracks with $3.2 million in BTC holdings, the UAE has built an extensive mining footprint. In 2022, Citadel and Phoenix jointly constructed an 80,000 square meter mining facility on Abu Dhabi’s Al Reem Island in just six months. Satellite imagery of the site matches the timeline of reported mining activity, while on-chain transfers between Phoenix and Citadel confirm disclosures made in official filings, according to Arkham. UAE ranks fourth among state Bitcoin holders Arkham now places the UAE as the fourth largest government-linked Bitcoin holder globally, trailing the U.S., the U.K., and the Royal Government of Bhutan, and just ahead of El Salvador. By contrast, while the U.S. holds over 200,000 BTC primarily from seizures, the UAE’s holdings demonstrate direct sovereign participation in Bitcoin mining infrastructure. With its $719 million position and ongoing mining expansion, the UAE is positioning itself as a key institutional player in Bitcoin’s evolving global landscape.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) turned small investments into millions almost overnight, proving that meme coins can create generational wealth when timed correctly. A fresh wave of tokens is poised to repeat history, and this time, the opportunity could be even bigger. With just $1,500 spread across three carefully chosen meme coins, investors have the potential to build a 6-figure portfolio before the bull cycle peaks. The three tokens leading this charge are Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , BONK, and Pudgy Penguins (PENGU). Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Is Emerging as the Most Explosive Meme Coin of 2025 No meme coin has captured investor attention this year quite like Little Pepe (LILPEPE). Already listed on CoinMarketCap and backed by a successful presale that has raised over $21.6 million while selling more than 13.8 billion tokens, LILPEPE is quickly separating itself from the crowded meme coin field. The token is in stage 11 of its presale at just $0.002 and will debut on two top-tier centralized exchanges, giving it immediate access to millions of traders. What makes LILPEPE unique is its dedicated Layer 2 blockchain built exclusively for meme coins. This chain promises to be the fastest and cheapest in the market while resisting sniper bots, creating a safe and efficient environment for meme traders. The team behind LILPEPE includes anonymous experts with a track record of backing successful meme projects, further adding to investor confidence. Price forecasts are eye catching: if LILPEPE climbs toward $0.50–$0.75 by the end of 2025, early investors could see gains exceeding 20,000%. That means even a modest $500 allocation has the potential to grow into over $100,000 within this cycle. BONK Continues to Lead Solana’s Meme Revolution Trading at around $0.00003317 with a $2.6 billion market cap, BONK has been the flagship meme project of the Solana ecosystem. Its explosive growth in late 2023 set the tone for a new generation of Solana-native meme tokens, and the momentum has not slowed down. Analysts predict BONK could rally another 1000%, pushing its price closer to $0.00036487. With Solana experiencing record adoption, BONK is positioned to ride the wave of network expansion and investor interest. Community strength is one of BONK’s biggest assets, as its holders have shown a long-term commitment reminiscent of Dogecoin’s early days. For investors with $500 to spare, BONK offers both relative stability compared to microcaps and the chance for major upside. If it hits predicted levels, a $500 stake could grow into $5,000 or more, adding significant value to a meme focused portfolio. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) Brings Cultural Branding Into the Meme Coin Market Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) has successfully bridged the gap between NFTs and meme coins. Originally one of the most iconic NFT collections, Pudgy Penguins has evolved into a tokenized project with a strong brand identity, community recognition, and expanding global partnerships. Currently trading at around $0.031 with a $1.9 billion market cap, Pudgy World launch on zkSync, blending toys and on-chain assets, drives mainstream appeal. Analysts expect $0.30 by Q4, representing a 900% gain, as NFT interest surges. PENGU’s merchandise and licensing deals expand its reach, offering more than BONK’s pure meme play. Its low price and cultural pull make it a 2025 breakout candidate, with NFT utility fueling long term value. With the potential for token integration across its ecosystem and plans for physical toys and media, PENGU is likely to ride the next meme-driven wave alongside the likes of LILPEPE and BONK. Conclusion The next wave of wealth creation will likely come from meme coins that combine cultural power with innovative ecosystems. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , BONK, and Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) are three of the strongest plays under $1 today, and they offer investors the rare chance to turn small sums into six figures. With market momentum building and the bull run gaining strength, a handful of tokens are set up to produce gains that outstrip the crowd. If you’re ready to weigh the odds and not afraid of a carefully planned risk, now is the ideal moment to grab an early seat on what may become the next trending meme coin.

Among these, tokens like Shiba Inu have demonstrated the potential for astronomical returns. Now, a new generation of meme coins, including Little Pepe (LILPEPE), BONK, and Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), is poised to make a similar impact. By strategically investing $1,500 across these tokens, investors could potentially amass a portfolio worth six figures. Let's delve into the specifics of each coin and why they stand out in the bustling meme coin market. Spotlight on Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Rising Star of Meme Coins Among the freshest and most promising entries in the meme coin market is Little Pepe (LILPEPE). This token has not only completed a hugely successful presale but is also making headway with its dedicated Layer 2 blockchain tailored for meme coins. The presale success, raising over $21.6 million, signifies strong market trust and investor interest. Discover more about Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Investors looking for a high-potential asset need to keep a close eye on LILPEPE's journey. Its distinct infrastructure designed to thwart sniper bots showcases a forward-thinking approach to creating a sustainable trading environment. The potential price increase to $0.50-$0.75 per token could turn a $500 investment into $100,000 by the end of 2025, marking an extraordinary 20,000% gain. BONK: Championing the Solana Meme Coin Movement BONK is leading the charge in the Solana ecosystem, which is known for its high-speed blockchain technology. The meme coin has already seen significant growth and analysts predict a further 1000% increase in its value. For those investing $500, this could mean escalating the value to $5,000, offering a stable yet profitable investment opportunity within the volatile meme coin sector. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU): Integrating NFTs with Meme Coins Pudgy Penguins, originally an NFT collection, has effectively transitioned into the meme coin arena, marrying cultural branding with tokenomics. As NFTs continue to captivate the market, PENGU rides this wave with its blend of digital and physical collectibles, pushing its market cap to $1.9 billion and positioning itself for a potential 900% price increase. Conclusion The potential for significant financial gains in the meme coin market continues to grow as these digital assets gain cultural and economic traction.

The platform aims to enable instant T+0 transfers, provide yield on tokenized stocks, and integrate with DeFi protocols. Tokenized assets will be made natively accessible to AI agents through the Cronos AI Agent SDK and its Proof of Identity standard. The second engine, distribution, leverages Cronos’ integration with Crypto.com to provide access for more than 150 million retail users to DeFi services such as lending and staking. Merchant adoption is expected to scale across 10 million eligible businesses, with Cronos products embedded within Crypto.com’s fiat rails and Project Cortex, its LLM-powered financial interface. The third engine, demand, will be anchored around CRO , the native token of Cronos. This includes support for CRO-powered ETFs in the U.S. and EU and partnerships with digital asset treasury companies to reinforce liquidity and CRO’s institutional utility. Tying tokenization, AI, and DeFi into one interoperable system Cronos reports recent network upgrades have reduced block times to 0.5 seconds and decreased gas fees, resulting in a reported 400% increase in daily transactions. The roadmap sets targets for 2026, including $20 billion in CRO through public markets, $10 billion in deployed tokenized assets, and 20 million users across centralized and decentralized finance platforms. “Blockchain must evolve from niche trading rails into true financial infrastructure,” said Mirko Zhao, Head of Cronos Labs. “This roadmap is about tying tokenization, AI, and DeFi into one interoperable system that institutions and retail users alike can rely on. With our distribution through Crypto.com and a foundation of regulatory credibility, we believe Cronos is uniquely positioned to make that leap.” Working with Crypto.com and decentralized exchanges, including VVS Finance and H2 Finance, Cronos has introduced features connecting Web3 wallets to the Crypto.com debit card, allowing users to move funds on-chain and make real-world purchases. The announcement comes as the tokenization sector has grown to $25 billion, with projections suggesting potential growth to $18 trillion by 2033. The stablecoin market currently represents $271 billion in value. Featured image via Shutterstock.

Remiitix and BTC Bull are leading the established presale charts, but Bitfrac is quickly becoming one of the top new crypto presales for 2025. It offers a unique utility model by linking token ownership to real Bitcoin mining profits. This approach gives investors a direct line to passive income without the need to run mining hardware themselves. In a market full of presale cryptocurrency options, Bitfrac stands out with its clear revenue-sharing structure and strong operational foundation. With Stage 1 now live, early supporters have the opportunity to buy presale crypto tokens at just $0.017 before the next price increase. This new crypto token presale has already raised over $1.89M and is filling fast. Investors looking for sustainable, utility-based crypto coins on presale may find Bitfrac to be one of the best crypto presale options available right now on the crypto presale list. Bitfrac Delivers Real-World Value Through Bitcoin Mining Bitfrac connects users to industrial-scale Bitcoin mining without the complexity of setting up their own systems. It provides an accessible entry point to passive income generation backed by real-world infrastructure. With just $100, users can buy Bitfrac tokens and secure fractional ownership in active mining operations. Each token reflects a share in the equipment and energy used to mine Bitcoin around the clock. The company handles everything from procurement to deployment. Bitfrac’s mining rigs run 24/7 in energy-efficient facilities worldwide, maintained by experts who focus on performance and uptime. Investors can monitor their shares through a user-friendly dashboard. Profits are distributed automatically, and everything is tracked transparently on-chain. Stage 1 of this crypto ICO presale is now open, priced at $0.017 per BFT token. Bitfrac has already raised $1.89M, reaching 94% of its $2M target. Spots at this price tier are limited, making this one of the top crypto presale projects to explore before it moves to the next stage. BTC Bull Bounces After the Recent Slow Growth BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) is an Ethereum presale token with milestone-based mechanisms connected to Bitcoin price fluctuations. As Bitcoin approaches specified thresholds, BTCBULL is programmed to initiate token burning and the distribution of BTC incentives, reducing its circulating quantity over time. During the presale phase, the project also offers a staking option. While the design implicitly reflects Bitcoin’s movement, BTCBULL portrays itself as a community-centered experiment, with features based on scarcity and interaction rather than direct Bitcoin ownership. Remittix Bridges Crypto With Daily Finance Remittix is emerging as a major player in the utility token space. Its platform offers over 40 crypto pairs and 30 fiat options, aiming to integrate digital assets into everyday spending. At just $0.0895, Remittix’s RTX token is still in its early stages. However, activity is picking up as the team prepares to launch the wallet beta on September 15. This platform focuses on smooth transactions between crypto and real-world currencies, making it more practical than many standard presale crypto tokens. With a functional use case already in development, Remittix is moving up the crypto presale list as one of the more grounded crypto presale projects in 2025. Get Paid Monthly Through Bitfrac Smart Contracts Bitfrac simplifies earnings with automated smart contracts that distribute mining profits monthly. Once users purchase tokens, they can sit back while the system calculates and sends earnings to their wallets. There’s no need to claim rewards manually. All profits are handled on-chain. The monthly payout model is designed for consistency. As the mining infrastructure grows, users receive a portion of the income based on how many BFT tokens they hold. This approach makes Bitfrac one of the best crypto presale opportunities for investors who value predictable utility. It also offers an alternative to purely speculative token presales by tying earnings to actual Bitcoin production. Final Words: Bitfrac Offers Practical Entry Into Mining As crypto presale projects compete for attention in 2025, Bitfrac is carving a space with real-world mining as its foundation. It combines blockchain transparency with Bitcoin mining’s proven profitability. With Stage 1 pricing set at $0.017 and over $1.89M already raised, this new crypto token presale offers more than hype. It offers infrastructure-backed value and monthly income for its holders. In a growing crypto ICO presale landscape, Bitfrac brings something different, function, utility, and long-term use. For those seeking the best crypto presale to buy right now, Bitfrac has earned its place on the crypto presale list with a solid foundation and transparent operations.

The company announced new enforcement steps aimed at cracking down on fraudulent syndicates, bot-driven trading, and suspicious capital flows. These actions have also sparked tension with a prominent KOL, whose account was frozen amid compliance-related risks. According to the company, more than 17,000 accounts were restricted during July and August, representing over 3,000 fraud syndicates. The use of AI-powered risk models, MEXC said, has helped reduce fraudulent activity by 62% compared to earlier periods. The platform also implemented stricter compliance checks on accounts with unusual fund movements. Some accounts remain under restriction after failing to meet advanced KYC standards, with reports filed to regulators in recent months. MEXC’s moves coincide with a dispute involving TheWhiteWhale, a crypto influencer who alleged his account was frozen without cause and launched a $2 million campaign against the exchange. MEXC countered with a statement suggeting the account may be tied to compliance risk, underscoring the challenges exchanges face in balancing regulatory enforcement with user expectations. Similar dilemmas have also been faced by other major exchanges, including OKX. According to MEXC’s statement , compliance and legal risks refer to accounts linked to unusual funds, such as those associated with criminal activity, sanctioned entities, or stolen assets. MEXC has reinforced restrictions on bot trading in its futures markets after detecting a surge in violations of platform rules. The exchange said the measure is intended to protect retail users, who are often at a disadvantage against automated systems. Between July and August, 2,008 bot accounts were identified and restricted — a 24% increase compared with the previous two months.

This initiative aims to curtail the activities of fraudulent syndicates and bot-driven trading, which have seen a significant uptick. The rigorous enforcement of these measures has led to the freezing of over 17,000 accounts linked to more than 3,000 fraud syndicates in just two months. The introduction of AI-driven risk models by MEXC has reportedly slashed fraudulent activities by 62%, demonstrating the effectiveness of technology in combating such issues. The platform's commitment extends to implementing stricter compliance checks, particularly for accounts exhibiting unusual financial activities, which remain restricted pending further investigation. Clash with Crypto Influencers Over Account Restrictions A notable fallout from MEXC’s tightened security measures is the dispute with TheWhiteWhale, a well-known figure in the crypto world. The influencer's account was frozen, leading to a public outcry and a subsequent $2 million campaign against MEXC. In response, MEXC issued a statement , suggesting potential compliance risks associated with the account. This incident underscores the delicate balance exchanges must maintain between regulatory compliance and user satisfaction. Similar challenges are echoed across the industry, with other major exchanges grappling with these issues. For instance, MEXC’s statement also highlights the broader concern of accounts potentially linked to criminal networks, highlighting the gravity of legal and compliance risks faced by trading platforms. Enhancements in Bot Trading Regulations In addition to combating fraud, MEXC has also tightened controls on bot trading within its futures markets. This move comes after detecting a significant increase in rule violations by automated trading systems. Such systems can often outmaneuver human traders, leading to a skewed trading environment. To counter this, MEXC restricted 2,008 bot accounts during a recent two-month period, marking a 24% increase in such actions compared to prior months.

On-chain analysis points to a significant player potentially acting as the primary CRO market maker . This revelation could have substantial implications for how CRO tokens are traded and valued across the market. Is Flow Traders the Primary CRO Market Maker? Recent on-chain investigations by analyst ai_9684xtpa suggest that Flow Traders, a prominent global trading firm, might be operating as the main CRO market maker . This suspicion stems from substantial movements of CRO tokens over the past few months. Understanding the role of a market maker is crucial here. What is a market maker? A market maker provides liquidity to financial markets by simultaneously offering to buy and sell an asset. This ensures there’s always someone to trade with, narrowing the bid-ask spread and making trading more efficient. The evidence: Over the last four months, an astonishing 610 million CRO tokens, valued at approximately $60.47 million, have been withdrawn from Crypto.com. A staggering 98.8% of this total then moved to a contract address associated with BitGo. These massive, consistent transfers raise questions about the identity and intentions behind such significant movements. Consequently, the focus turns to firms like Flow Traders, known for their high-frequency trading and market-making operations. The Critical Role of BitGo in CRO Transfers The fact that nearly all these withdrawn CRO tokens ended up in a BitGo contract address is particularly noteworthy. BitGo is a trusted digital asset custodian, primarily serving institutional clients. This detail strongly suggests that these movements are not typical retail activity. Why is BitGo’s involvement significant? Institutional custody: BitGo provides secure, regulated custody solutions for large-scale investors and businesses. Its use implies professional management of these vast CRO holdings. Trust and security: Institutions choose BitGo for its robust security protocols and compliance. Therefore, these transfers indicate a high level of organization and strategic intent behind the CRO movements. This institutional-grade handling further strengthens the argument that a sophisticated entity, possibly a dedicated CRO market maker , is at play. Unpacking the Trump Media Group’s Vision for CRO Tokens Adding another layer of intrigue to the CRO ecosystem is a previous, significant announcement. Trump Media Group and Crypto.com had signed an agreement to establish a cryptocurrency treasury firm. The ambitious goal was to purchase $6.42 billion in CRO tokens. This historical context is important because: It highlights the potential for immense institutional demand for CRO tokens. Such large-scale purchasing plans would necessitate robust market infrastructure, including efficient market making, to handle the volume without causing significant price volatility. While the direct connection between this past agreement and current market-making activities remains speculative, it certainly underscores the potential for major players to influence the CRO market. What Does a Dominant CRO Market Maker Mean for Investors? The identification of a major CRO market maker like Flow Traders carries several implications for investors and the overall health of the CRO token. It’s a double-edged sword, offering both benefits and potential challenges. Potential Benefits: Enhanced Liquidity: A dedicated market maker ensures there’s always a buyer and seller, making it easier for investors to enter and exit positions. Tighter Spreads: The difference between the bid and ask price (the spread) tends to be smaller, leading to more efficient trading costs. Potential Challenges: Centralization Concerns: If one entity controls a significant portion of market making, it could exert undue influence over price discovery. Transparency: Understanding the motivations and strategies of a dominant market maker can be difficult, leading to information asymmetry. Investors should always monitor market depth and on-chain analytics to gain insights into such significant movements. These insights can help in making informed decisions. Conclusion: The Unfolding CRO Market Story The evidence presented by on-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa strongly suggests that Flow Traders is operating as a significant, if not primary, CRO market maker . The massive withdrawals from Crypto.com and subsequent transfers to BitGo contract addresses paint a compelling picture of institutional-level involvement. While this can bring much-needed liquidity and stability to the CRO token, it also raises important questions about market centralization and transparency. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, understanding the roles of key players like market makers becomes increasingly vital for all participants. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a cryptocurrency market maker? A cryptocurrency market maker is an entity that provides liquidity to a specific token by continuously offering to buy and sell it. They profit from the bid-ask spread and ensure efficient trading for other participants. Q2: Why is Flow Traders suspected of being the CRO market maker? On-chain analysis identified substantial withdrawals of CRO from Crypto.com, with almost all of it moving to BitGo contract addresses. Flow Traders is a well-known high-frequency trading firm often engaged in market making, making them a prime suspect for such large, institutional-grade activity. Q3: What is the significance of CRO tokens moving to BitGo? BitGo is a leading institutional custodian for digital assets. Transfers to BitGo typically indicate large-scale, professional, and secure management of funds, suggesting institutional involvement rather than individual retail activity. Q4: How does a dominant CRO market maker impact the token’s price? A dominant market maker can improve liquidity and reduce price volatility by narrowing spreads. However, it also means a single entity holds significant influence, which could, in theory, affect price discovery, though market makers typically aim for neutrality. Q5: Was there a previous deal involving Trump Media Group and CRO? Yes, Trump Media Group and Crypto.com previously agreed to establish a crypto treasury firm with the intention of purchasing $6.42 billion in CRO tokens. This highlights the potential for large-scale institutional interest in CRO. If you found this analysis insightful, please share it with your network!

Based on a joint investigation from the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the bank did not properly flag investment-banking ties with companies listed in Hong Kong in over 4,200 research notes issued between 2013-2021. The case began as a self-report by HSBC and led to a combined probe by the two regulators. Investigators said the shortcomings stemmed from weak mapping and data reporting across HSBC’s systems, which in turn meant required disclosures did not appear when research was published. Despite the control failures, the regulators said they had found no evidence that clients suffered losses as a result of the missing warnings. HSBC, in a statement , called the breach “a historic matter” and said it has fixed the relevant controls and systems. In 2019, Credit Suisse Limited along with Credit Suisse AG were fined by the SFC for a combined HK$2.8 million due to failure of disclosing relationships related to investment banking in research reports on securities listed in Hong Kong and issued between 2006 – 2016. Separately, earlier in 2025, Hang Seng Bank, where HSBC has a 62% stake, received a fine of HK$66.4 over allegations of charging customers higher when selling products related to investments. HSBC’s Swiss unit is removing wealthy clients in the Middle East The Financial Times recently reported that the bank’s Swiss unit has begun removing over 1,000 wealthy clients from the Middle East. People familiar with the move said the bank plans to end relationships with customers from countries including Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Lebanon. Many of those clients hold more than $100 million in assets. The Swiss unit has told affected customers they won’t get to use the services, and letters suggesting they move accounts are due to go out soon, one person said. Bloomberg News first reported the changes. HSBC continues to face scrutiny The revamp follows actions by Switzerland’s financial regulator, Finma, over the bank’s handling of higher-risk customers. Last year, HSBC’s Swiss unit was disallowed from bringing in public figures due to new clients being found of money-laundering breaches. The regulator concluded the bank had not carried out adequate due diligence on several transactions between 2002 – 2015, moving $300 million between Switzerland and Lebanon. In its findings, the watchdog said HSBC had “failed to recognise the indications of money laundering presented by these transactions; it likewise failed to satisfy requirements for the initiation and continuation of customer relationships with politically exposed persons, and was thus in serious breach of its due diligence obligations.” Finma ordered HSBC to conduct an anti-money-laundering review covering all high-risk relationships with politically exposed persons (PEPs). The bank, Finma said, cannot start new PEP relationships until the review is completed. HSBC’s internal rules classify clients with more than SFr100 million ($124.7 million) as “high risk,” a label that triggers enhanced checks. The bank also factors in other elements, such as nationality, when assigning risk ratings to customers. In a separate disclosure last month, HSBC said authorities in France and Switzerland are investigating the bank “in connection with alleged money laundering offences in respect of two historical banking relationships.” The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

This follows the conclusion of the long-running legal battle between the crypto firm and the U.S. SEC. XRP Lawyer Calls Out Counsel In Ripple Case In an X post, Bill Morgan revealed that the lead counsel for the SEC in the Ripple case is now a partner at a major law firm. The pro-XRP lawyer further stated that Tenreiro’s profile refers to some of his courtroom successes in crypto enforcement. However, he noted it oddly overlooks and does not mention his two-thirds loss in the Ripple case and the appeal he filed, which the SEC agreed to dismiss. Related Reading: SEC Delays Appeal Withdrawal In Ripple Lawsuit, Pro-XRP Lawyer Says Expect To Hear Something In This Timeframe In line with this, Morgan declared that even Tenreiro knows that Ripple succeeded in what matters. He said that he will always remember the lead counsel for running an “unsustainable legal theory” that XRP was a security, which Judge Torres ruled against by stating that the altcoin in itself is not a security. Meanwhile, the pro-XRP lawyer alluded to the lead counsel’s attempt to smear John Deaton’s character before the court in the Ripple case. Deaton was actively involved in the case as an amicus curiae, supporting the crypto firm in its case against the Commission. Notably, Tenreiro spearheaded other crypto cases during his time at the SEC. He brought the enforcement actions against Binance, Terraform Labs, and Sam Bankman-Fried in the FTX case. Just like the Ripple case, the Binance case has also been dropped, while Tenreiro and his team received a favorable ruling in the Terraform case. Notably, he was reassigned to the IT department when the Trump administration came into office. This was before Tenreiro’s exit from the SEC. XRP Lawsuit Finally Concludes The Ripple SEC lawsuit has finally concluded after almost five years, since the Commission first instituted the case. This development follows the U.S. Appeals Court’s approval of the Joint Stipulation of Dismissal from the crypto firm and the Commission. With this, the SEC and Ripple have now dropped their appeal and cross-appeal cases, respectively. Related Reading: XRP Price Crashes After SEC Denies XRP ETFs, What Are The Next Important Dates? The next move will be for Ripple to fulfill its $125 million monetary judgment that Judge Torres ordered against it in her final ruling due to its securities violations. The crypto firm will have to pay the complete sum, as Judge Torres decided not to adopt the settlement agreement that both parties had reached earlier in the year. Under the settlement agreement, Ripple would have only had to pay $50 million out of the $125 million. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.94, down almost 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The year 2025 is shaping up to be crucial, with fresh projects gaining momentum and drawing in global attention. The right choice can offer a strong entry point well before major exchange listings push prices higher. This roundup looks at four coins making headlines: Arbitrum, Pepe, and Bittensor are each showing traction through active ecosystems and rising use cases. BlockDAG, however, is stealing focus with its fast-selling presale and projected 36x upside. Here’s why these names stand out and why one in particular could become the best crypto coin of the year. BlockDAG: Racing Toward the Next Stage of Growth BlockDAG’s presale is advancing quickly, with limited time left to buy at early pricing. Now in Batch 29, BDAG coins are listed at $0.0276, while post-listing forecasts point to $1, creating a potential 36x return. With more than $383 million already raised toward its $600M target, each sold-out batch pushes the cost higher, reducing room for late entries. The appeal is built on real technology. BlockDAG’s hybrid DAG plus Proof-of-Work system delivers ultra-fast, highly secure, and scalable transactions without sacrificing decentralization. Adoption is strong, with 19,400 ASIC miners sold and 2.5 million users already mining through the X1 mobile app. Developers are preparing ahead of the mainnet launch, ensuring the network is ready from day one. Once Batch 29 finishes, prices move up immediately. History suggests the best crypto coin often rewards early entry, and BlockDAG (BDAG) could be one of 2025’s major success stories. Delays may mean paying five to ten times more within months, which is why many see it as the best crypto coin to follow right now. Arbitrum: Scaling Power Driving Market Growth Arbitrum has established itself as a leading Layer-2 scaling option, gaining directly from Ethereum’s rising activity. With its price climbing ~23% in the past week, even after a small pullback to $0.52, ARB is holding strong market traction. Its daily trading volume is close to $1 billion, while its total value locked (TVL) has hit a 2025 high of $3.39 billion. Much of this growth comes from expanding DeFi activity and its solid developer base. As Ethereum’s network grows, Arbitrum’s ability to deliver faster and cheaper transactions places it in a strong position for sustained adoption. Those exploring established infrastructure plays with upside potential may find ARB an appealing option within the best crypto coin landscape. Pepe (PEPE): Community Energy Backing Market Strength Pepe continues to highlight how meme coins can sustain high liquidity and engagement. Although down ~6% in the last 24 hours, it maintains daily trading volumes above $1.2 billion and a market cap of $4.7 billion. Its week-long stability (+0.1%) reflects firm community support, even through short-term swings. While much of Pepe’s appeal remains speculative, its deep liquidity and strong user activity give it a place worth watching. It may not fit the traditional mold of a best crypto coin, but its market presence ensures continued attention. Bittensor: AI Meets Blockchain for Long-Term Potential Bittensor is blending decentralized AI infrastructure with blockchain, creating a strong narrative for the future. Trading near $380, TAO has recorded steady weekly gains despite broader market volatility. Institutional attention is rising, with TAO Synergies committing $10 million and holding over 42,000 units. The network’s launch of a Uniswap V3-style liquidity provisioning interface has further boosted scalability and ease of access. Already active in the market, Bittensor’s ecosystem growth and technical upgrades give it a clear role alongside new entrants competing for the title of best crypto coin in the AI-driven blockchain field. Conclusion As 2025 progresses, the search for the best crypto coin options is heating up. Arbitrum shows strength in scaling, Pepe thrives through liquidity and community support, and Bittensor is carving its place in decentralized AI. Yet BlockDAG’s unique mix of advanced design, rapid adoption, and presale momentum sets it apart as a potential highlight. The message is clear: acting early in the right projects can create unmatched opportunities. Whether the focus is on established performers or high-upside presales, balancing stability with growth potential is key. The race for the best crypto coin is not just about choosing leaders; it is about moving before the market fully reacts. Right now, BlockDAG is offering a strong example of what a breakout setup looks like before it unfolds. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release for informational purposes only.

XRP is the native cryptocurrency of the XRP Ledger (XRPL), a decentralized blockchain built by Ripple Labs. According to a press release sent to CryptoPotato , the alliance has led to the launch of the XRP Earn Account. With this product, XRP investors can receive weekly yield payouts without navigating the complexities of using multiple blockchains, bridges, and protocols. How Does The Partnership Work? MoreMarket will integrate its on-chain yield generation strategy on the Flare network, creating a pathway to a seamless XRPfi experience. When using the XRP Earn Account, market participants will interact with a single interface on MoreMarkets. This is because the yield platform will completely handle the Flare mechanics for the offering. XRP holders will use a MoreMarket feature to initiate the XRP bridging process from their XRPL wallets. This triggers payments from their wallets to the FAssets system, which is a native bridge for minting FXRP on Flare. FXRP is the version of XRP on the Flare network. Afterward, Moremarkets will manage Flare-native decentralized finance (DeFi) strategies, such as lending or liquid staking, to generate yield for users. “Our mission is to make idle assets work for their holders without the headaches of DeFi. The XRP Earn Account is already delivering yield to hundreds of early adopters, and adding Flare gives them another high-quality path to earn. We’re really excited to be working with Flare to build the most liquid XRP on-chain ecosystem on Flare!” commented Altan Tutar, Co-founder and CEO of MoreMarkets. Liquid Staking XRP For DeFi Activities It is worth mentioning that MoreMarkets will use Firelight to liquid stake XRP . Firelight allows users to stake their XRP and earn rewards within the Flare network. The platform will issue a liquid staking token (LST) and Firelight Points to users who deploy FXRP. Participants can use the LST across DeFi activities in the Flare ecosystem. Also, MoreMarkets claims no centralized custodians are involved in the process, as Flare backs its FXRP 1:1 with collateral. Users’ XRP always remains on the XRPL. Meanwhile, MoreMarkets insists that all of the technicalities involving the partnership will happen at the backend so that the user will have a simple experience. All rewards will be converted to XRP and automatically paid into the user’s wallet.

In a surprise Ask Me Anything (AMA) session, he shared the update , explaining that the network has formed a new partnership with Copper. Hoskinson Unveils $23 Million Support For Cardano Native Tokens Hoskinson explained that when money is put directly into Cardano Native Tokens, it gives developers and users more tools to build, expand, and trust the network. According to him, with so many projects in the crypto market fighting for attention and adoption, substantial financial backing like this helps the network hold its ground against other blockchain networks. In the end, only those who receive genuine and active support will be able to grow and endure over time. Hoskinson reminds community members of the project’s aim to strengthen ADA and support the many tokens and projects developed on the Cardano network. The announcement during the AMA caught many community members by surprise, as most had expected a casual talk; however, Hoskinson revealed a significant step forward for Cardano. More than a single coin, it is an entire ecosystem that needs direct backing to grow, and the million-dollar boost is proof that the network is receiving active support with a long-term plan to stand out among rivals. Hoskinson’s decision to share this news and the new Copper partnership during AMA sessions, where people ask questions directly, helped the community feel included and connected to what is happening inside the project. New Copper Partnership Expands Custody And Exchange Access In addition to the $23 million investment news, Hoskinson also announced that Cardano has entered into a new partnership with Copper, one of the top names in digital asset custody. Now, with the Copper deal in place, Cardano can extend its access even further, as many exchanges that rely on Copper can now also support Cardano assets, helping them become listed, traded, and trusted by more users worldwide . It follows earlier agreements with Bitcoin.com, Blockchain.com, and Brave as they continue to build adoption opportunities for Cardano across multiple exchanges and custodians. One crucial example Hoskinson pointed out was the earlier integration with Blockchain.com, which gave access to 37 million users, creating a massive increase in adoption opportunities for ADA. Hoskinson says the financial support will strengthen the Cardano network while building strong partnerships with major companies in the crypto industry. The announcement highlights how combining $23 million in direct support and the new Copper partnership could boost ADA’s reach . With millions already invested and global platforms offering access, Cardano’s positioning in the market could stand firm and give its community more opportunities to grow with the network.",Cardano|ADA|ADA news|ADA Price|adausd|ADAUSDT|Cardano news|Cardano Price,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ADA|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-26 14:00:36

Through the PAXMINING cloud mining platform, investors can achieve astonishing investment returns without purchasing mining hardware or bearing high electricity costs. Latest data shows that top-tier users on the platform can earn up to $6,000 daily, a figure that is disrupting the entire digital currency investment landscape. Trend: Cloud Mining Becomes New Investment Darling The Bitcoin mining industry is undergoing fundamental change.

PAXMINING’s cloud mining service was developed to address these pain points. The platform allows investors to participate in mining by purchasing hashrate contracts, completely eliminating the hardware investment and technical burden. Users simply choose an investment plan that suits them and receive immediate and stable returns. Market analyst James Watson said, “Cloud mining represents the future of digital currency mining.

This design encourages long-term investment while providing more attractive return options for substantial capital. Testimonials: Real User Success Stories Sarah Chen, a young entrepreneur from Singapore, said: “As a female investor, I originally knew nothing about mining technology. PAXMINING enabled me to easily participate in this market. Now the first thing I do every morning is check the earnings data on my phone.

50711425,https://timestabloid.com/?p=80224,1756216971,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,This SWIFT History Will Change the Way You Think about Ripple and XRP,https://timestabloid.com/this-swift-history-will-change-the-way-you-think-about-ripple-and-xrp/,"A detailed thread shared by Pumpius, a well-followed voice in the XRP community, focused on the origins of the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) and its relevance when compared to RippleNet and XRP. Pumpius noted that SWIFT, often described as a neutral global system, was in fact created as a Western-centered institution. In 1973, 239 banks from 15 countries formed a cooperative in Belgium to replace Telex, the existing communication system used by banks. This development established a new structure for cross-border financial institutions, but the framework was anchored in the trans-Atlantic financial bloc. According to Pumpius, oversight was built into the system from its inception, as SWIFT is incorporated in Belgium and falls under the jurisdiction of the National Bank of Belgium, with additional supervision from the central banks of the G-10 countries. This gave advanced economies a structured role in SWIFT’s governance. Shareholders elect their 25-member board of directors through National Member Groups, where voting rights are proportional to message volume, a model that has historically favored large Western banks. What you were taught about SWIFT is incomplete. This will change the way you think about #Ripple and #XRP pic.twitter.com/phkpitPadH — Pumpius (@pumpius) August 24, 2025 Messaging Without Settlement Pumpius emphasized that SWIFT does not move money but instead transmits instructions between institutions, which still rely on correspondent banking chains. This structure requires banks to maintain pre-funded nostro and vostro accounts across multiple jurisdictions, leading to settlement delays, opaque fees, and inefficiencies. The lack of real-time settlement remains a significant limitation. The use of SWIFT as a political instrument was also highlighted. In 2012, SWIFT disconnected Iranian banks following European Union sanctions, a move that aligned with U.S. Treasury objectives. More recently, in response to Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Russian banks were removed from the SWIFT network, further confirming how governance and jurisdiction can be leveraged for geopolitical purposes. Pumpius argued that this reliance on bloc politics demonstrated that SWIFT’s neutrality has been overstated. RippleNet and the XRP Ledger In contrast to SWIFT’s model, Pumpius explained that RippleNet and its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) system use XRP to facilitate settlement across currencies without the need for pre-funded accounts. RippleNet shares a single API that handles messaging, clearing, and settlement in real time. By leveraging XRP as a bridge asset, institutions can complete transactions within seconds, rather than days, eliminating the reliance on correspondent banking chains. Pumpius described the XRP Ledger (XRPL) as a decentralized and public blockchain designed for neutrality by architecture. XRP serves as its native asset, enabling transparent and auditable settlement that is non-location specific. According to the Pundit, this structure removes the concentration of influence held by Western authorities within SWIFT’s governance model.

Pumpius noted that this process represents a slow and incremental upgrade of decades-old infrastructure, highlighting the challenges of adapting legacy systems to modern requirements. Meanwhile, RippleNet and the XRP Ledger offer what Pumpius described as an “end-state” solution for global financial settlement. As the demand for faster, auditable, and geopolitically neutral payment infrastructure grows, he argued that RippleNet and XRP provide a framework that reduces reliance on political chokepoints and offers efficiency beyond messaging alone. In his closing remarks, Pumpius positioned RippleNet and XRP not as alternatives to SWIFT, but as fundamentally different systems designed for real-time value movement. This distinction, he suggested, becomes increasingly important as financial institutions explore tokenized liquidity and settlement technologies in response to ongoing fragmentation in global payment routes.

Specifically, the Bitcoin 100-day EMA (Exponential Moving Average) is facing a crucial test, keeping investors on edge. This key technical indicator often dictates short-term price direction, and its potential breach has sparked significant discussion among market analysts. Many traders are closely watching this level, understanding its historical significance. A failure to hold could trigger a cascade of selling pressure, leading to substantial price corrections. Bitcoin Price Faces a Critical Test at the Bitcoin 100-day EMA According to recent reports, Bitcoin could potentially plummet to $103,000 if it fails to maintain its position above the 100-day Exponential Moving Average on its daily chart. This level is not just a number; it represents a significant psychological and technical battleground for bulls and bears alike. Prominent trader Cryptorphic has highlighted the historical context of such a move. Historically, a decisive drop below the 100-day EMA has often preceded deeper short-term corrections. Cryptorphic expressed a personal hope for a swift recovery above this level, which would help sustain Bitcoin’s broader upward trend. Understanding the Bitcoin 100-day EMA : Why It Matters The Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is a type of moving average that places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points. The 100-day EMA, therefore, gives more importance to recent price action over the past 100 days, making it a highly responsive indicator for medium-term trends. For traders, the Bitcoin 100-day EMA often acts as a dynamic support or resistance level. When the price is above it, the EMA typically provides support during pullbacks. Conversely, if the price falls below, it can turn into a resistance barrier, making it harder for the price to recover. Key Indicator: It offers a clear visual representation of the underlying trend. Historical Significance: Past performance shows its influence on price corrections. Trader Sentiment: Many traders use it as a trigger for entry or exit strategies. What Happens If the Bitcoin 100-day EMA Fails? Deeper Corrections Ahead? Cointelegraph further reported that some traders are already preparing for a scenario where the current correction extends significantly. This could push BTC prices much lower than anticipated, potentially including a retest and subsequent breach of the crucial $100,000 mark. This psychological barrier is vital for market confidence. Should the $100,000 support level fail to hold, on-chain indicators suggest that the next significant line of defense could emerge in the $92,000 to $93,000 range. This area typically represents strong accumulation zones or previous resistance levels that could now act as support. Investors need to be aware of these potential downside targets. Navigating Potential Volatility: Actionable Insights for Your Portfolio In times of market uncertainty, having a clear strategy is paramount. Here are some actionable insights for investors monitoring the Bitcoin 100-day EMA and the broader market: Monitor Closely: Keep a keen eye on Bitcoin’s daily closes relative to the 100-day EMA. A sustained close below this level could signal further weakness. Risk Management: Consider setting stop-loss orders to protect your capital against significant downturns. Diversification: Ensure your portfolio is well-diversified to mitigate risks associated with single asset volatility. Research: Always conduct your own thorough research and consider multiple indicators, not just one. Stay Informed: Follow reputable news sources and expert analyses to understand market sentiment and potential catalysts. Understanding these dynamics helps you make informed decisions, whether you are a long-term holder or an active trader. The market often presents opportunities even amidst corrections, but preparation is key. Summary: Bitcoin at a Crossroads Bitcoin currently stands at a pivotal moment, with its immediate price trajectory heavily dependent on its ability to hold the Bitcoin 100-day EMA . While a fall to $103,000, or even lower to the $92,000-$93,000 range, remains a distinct possibility if this critical support fails, the market also holds the potential for recovery if the level is reclaimed. Staying informed and employing sound risk management strategies will be crucial for navigating the weeks ahead in the dynamic cryptocurrency market.

The purchases, made between Aug. 18 and Aug. 24, averaged $4,462 per ETH, according to a Tuesday press release . SharpLink also reported staking rewards had risen to 1,799 ETH since the firm launched its treasury strategy in June.

The company announced a remarkable expansion of its BNB holdings , signaling a bold strategic investment in the cryptocurrency space. This development offers a fascinating look into how traditional companies are embracing the future of finance. What Propels CEA Industries’ BNB Holdings Beyond Expectations? CEA Industries, a prominent Nasdaq-listed entity, shared exciting news via a press release on August 26. The company revealed that its total BNB holdings have impressively surpassed the 350,000 mark. This isn’t just a small bump; it represents a substantial increase of 150,000 BNB from its initial purchase of 200,000 tokens. To put this into perspective, such an expansion requires significant capital and a clear vision. CEA Industries previously secured a substantial $500 million private funding round. This massive investment was spearheaded by Easy Labs, specifically to fuel the company’s strategic endeavors in digital assets, particularly in acquiring more BNB. This financial backing underscores a strong commitment to their cryptocurrency strategy. Key takeaways from this announcement include: Significant Growth: An increase of 150,000 BNB, bringing total holdings to over 350,000. Strategic Funding: A $500 million private funding round led by Easy Labs enabled these substantial BNB holdings . Market Confidence: A Nasdaq-listed company publicly increasing its crypto exposure demonstrates growing institutional confidence in digital currencies. Why Are Strategic BNB Holdings a Smart Move for Corporations? Many might wonder why a company like CEA Industries would make such a considerable bet on cryptocurrency. The decision to expand BNB holdings can be rooted in several strategic benefits. Firstly, digital assets offer a new avenue for portfolio diversification. In an increasingly volatile global economy, traditional assets alone might not provide optimal risk-adjusted returns. Furthermore, cryptocurrencies like BNB, which powers the BNB Chain ecosystem, present unique growth potential. They are integral to decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and various Web3 applications. Investing in such foundational tokens allows companies to gain exposure to these burgeoning sectors. This positions them to potentially benefit from future technological advancements and broader adoption. For CEA Industries, these expanded BNB holdings could also be a strategic hedge against inflation or a way to access liquidity and transactional efficiency that traditional financial systems might not offer as readily. Navigating the Landscape of Corporate Crypto Investments While the potential rewards of substantial BNB holdings are clear, corporate cryptocurrency investments are not without their challenges. The crypto market is known for its volatility, with prices fluctuating dramatically in short periods. This requires robust risk management strategies and a deep understanding of market dynamics. Companies must also navigate a complex and evolving regulatory landscape. Governments worldwide are still working to establish clear guidelines for digital assets, which can introduce uncertainty. Therefore, due diligence and adherence to compliance standards are paramount for any corporation venturing into this space. However, CEA Industries’ move could also inspire other traditional firms to consider similar strategies. Their transparent announcement, coming from a Nasdaq-listed entity, lends credibility to the idea of corporate crypto adoption. It suggests a growing maturity in the digital asset market, where well-researched and strategically executed investments can become a significant part of a company’s financial future. CEA Industries’ decision to significantly increase its BNB holdings is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a powerful statement. It underscores a forward-thinking approach to corporate finance, embracing digital assets as a legitimate and potentially lucrative component of a diversified portfolio. As the digital economy continues to evolve, such strategic moves by established companies will undoubtedly pave the way for broader institutional engagement in the crypto world, shaping the financial landscape for years to come. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is BNB and why is it significant? BNB (Build and Build) is the native cryptocurrency of the BNB Chain ecosystem. It’s significant because it powers transactions, enables participation in various decentralized applications, and offers utility across a vast network of Web3 services, making it a foundational asset in the crypto space. How did CEA Industries fund its increased BNB holdings? CEA Industries funded its expanded BNB holdings through a substantial $500 million private funding round. This round was specifically led by Easy Labs, indicating a dedicated effort to facilitate strategic investments in digital assets. What are the benefits for a company holding a large amount of cryptocurrency like BNB? Benefits include portfolio diversification, potential for significant capital appreciation, access to the rapidly growing digital economy (DeFi, NFTs, Web3), and potential hedges against traditional market inflation or volatility. Are there risks associated with corporate BNB holdings? Yes, significant risks include market volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and potential security challenges. Companies must implement robust risk management strategies and stay informed about the evolving legal and technical landscape. What does CEA Industries’ move mean for the broader crypto market? This move by a Nasdaq-listed company lends increased credibility and legitimacy to the cryptocurrency market. It signals a growing trend of institutional adoption, potentially encouraging other traditional firms to explore strategic digital asset investments.
