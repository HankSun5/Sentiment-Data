Recent Cardano news highlights its collaboration with FC Barcelona under the ""Barça Vision"" initiative, showcasing how blockchain technology is enhancing fan engagement through ADA rewards and NFT offerings. On the other hand, Fantom price remains under scrutiny as the platform works to regain stability following significant sell-offs by major holders, raising concerns about its future price trajectory. Amid these developments, BlockDAG (BDAG) is coming out ahead, with a bold vision that includes fostering over 200 Web3 projects and launching global hackathons in partnership with HackerEarth. By tapping into HackerEarth's network of 7.6 million developers, BlockDAG is dedicating itself to laying down the infrastructure for large-scale decentralized innovation. Having already raised over $182.5 million in its presale, with BDAG coins priced attractively at $0.0248, it's carving out a promising niche for buyers looking for significant returns. Cardano News: FC Barcelona Partnership Aims to Reshape Fan Experience In recent Cardano news, the cryptocurrency has stepped into the sports arena through a significant partnership with FC Barcelona, unveiled under the club's ""Barça Vision"" project on January 10, 2025. This collaboration seeks to revolutionize fan interaction by integrating blockchain tech to offer new job prospects, blockchain education, and a rewards system packed with ADA tokens and NFTs. This announcement gave Cardano's ADA token a nice 4% bump to $0.95, despite a tough market week that saw it slide down 11%. Cardano continues to hold strong as the world's 9th largest cryptocurrency by market cap, which currently stands at $33.5 billion, signaling a robust and expanding ecosystem. This venture highlights the transformative potential of blockchain in professional sports, showcasing ADA's critical role. The growing use cases and adoption rates offer exciting opportunities for those investing in innovative digital assets. Fantom (FTM) Price Faces Challenges Amid Whale Activity The Fantom price has seen a modest 3% recovery in the last 24 hours, but it's still down by 20% over the past week, struggling to reverse a bearish trend. The Average Directional Index (ADX), a tool for measuring trend strength, points to a weakening downtrend at 31.4, suggesting the market could be moving towards stabilization. Compounding the issue, there’s been a notable decline in activity from large holders, increasing selling pressure. The count of wallets holding between 1 million and 10 million FTM dropped from 84 to 69 in just one week, impacting the coin's liquidity. Currently, Fantom's price is wavering around $0.618 at a crucial support point. Falling below this could push prices down to test $0.50, while any recovery effort could send it climbing towards the $0.879 resistance level. Fantom continues to be a coin worth watching as it aims to regain stability and momentum. BlockDAG’s Bold Strategy: 200+ Web3 Projects & Worldwide Hackathons Looking ahead, BlockDAG is prepping for a groundbreaking year with extensive plans, including a significant alliance with HackerEarth. This partnership will facilitate four global hackathons aimed at engaging between 10,000 to 15,000 developers from HackerEarth’s comprehensive network of 7.6 million tech experts. These hackathons are crafted to spur innovation and foster a vibrant global community of developers. BlockDAG's overarching ambition is to stimulate the development of more than 200 Web3 projects within its ecosystem, giving developers the tools to innovate, test, and deploy cutting-edge decentralized applications (dApps), while showcasing what the BlockDAG Network can do. With a detailed roadmap and a visionary outlook for the future, BlockDAG is positioning itself as an increasingly appealing buying option. Market analysts estimate that BDAG, currently priced at $0.0248, could potentially soar to $1 by 2025. Its sophisticated technology, burgeoning ecosystem, and practical utility are catching the eyes of buyers eager for top-tier opportunities in today's crypto market. And the momentum is only building. BlockDAG’s presale has already netted over $182.5 million and is quickly advancing toward its $600 million target. As more developers join the ecosystem and drive its expansion, BlockDAG is affirming its role as a pivotal player in the Web3 domain. The outlook is bright for both developers and users venturing into the decentralized opportunities that BlockDAG offers. Best Altcoins For 2025 As Cardano and Fantom each navigate their unique challenges and opportunities, BlockDAG emerges as the standout blockchain platform for growth and innovation. Its ambitious initiatives, including organizing hackathons and expanding its Web3 project ecosystem, demonstrate its dedication to scalability and practical utility. Market experts forecast that BDAG could hit $1 by 2025, buoyed by its solid presale results and a strategy centered around developer engagement.

Recent Cardano updates spotlight its strategic collaboration with FC Barcelona through the ""Barça Vision"" project, demonstrating how blockchain is elevating fan interactions with ADA rewards and NFTs. Conversely, the price of Fantom is under examination as the platform strives to regain footing after major holders undertook significant sell-offs, sparking concerns about its future pricing path. In the midst of these shifts, BlockDAG (BDAG) is making notable strides with an ambitious plan to support over 200 Web3 initiatives and host global hackathons in collaboration with HackerEarth. By leveraging HackerEarth's extensive network of 7.6 million developers, BlockDAG is committed to establishing the groundwork for widespread decentralized innovation. Having successfully raised over $182.5 million in its presale, with BDAG coins attractively priced at $0.0248, it's creating a lucrative opportunity for investors seeking substantial returns.

This endeavor underscores the transformative power of blockchain in professional sports, highlighting ADA's essential role. Increasing use cases and adoption rates present thrilling prospects for those investing in digital assets at the forefront of innovation. Fantom (FTM) Price Under Pressure from Large-Scale Selling Fantom's price has shown a slight 3% recovery over the past day, but it remains down by 20% for the week, struggling against a bearish trend. The Average Directional Index (ADX), which measures trend strength, indicates a weakening downtrend at 31.4, hinting that the market might be stabilizing. Adding to the challenges, there's been a noticeable reduction in activity from large holders, exerting further selling pressure. The number of wallets holding between 1 million and 10 million FTM decreased from 84 to 69 in just a week, affecting the coin's liquidity. Currently, Fantom's price hovers around $0.618, a critical support level. Dropping below this could drive prices down to test $0.50, whereas a recovery effort might propel it towards the $0.879 resistance. Fantom remains a cryptocurrency to monitor as it seeks to regain stability and upward momentum. BlockDAG's Ambitious Agenda: Launching 200+ Web3 Projects with Global Hackathons Looking forward, BlockDAG is gearing up for a transformative year, marked by a major partnership with HackerEarth.

Elon Musk Salute (MUSKSAL), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKSAL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Elon Musk Salute can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Musk Salute could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Musk Salute launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Musk Salute on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Musk Salute by entering its contract address – GmFHmHWARyCD1FHVHiCc3kXZPwCDvzR5gFu2sFeeGphP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKSAL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-21 23:29:15

Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Jan. 21st, Brian reportedly told Yahoo Finance that Trump’s enthusiasm for Bitcoin proves his ambition to make America the “crypto capital of the planet.” “He really wants to be the first Bitcoin president,” Brian said, adding that his meetings with Trump before and after the election focused on the crypto industry’s potential. The Coinbase CEO explained that just as the U.S. holds reserves in gold, oil, and rare minerals like palladium, Bitcoin is the next logical step. “The world is moving to a Bitcoin standard for money. Any government that holds gold should also hold Bitcoin as a reserve. President Trump gets that.” The First Family’s crypto venture Last Friday, the president launched his meme coin Official Trump (TRUMP), marketed with the slogan, “Join the Trump Community. This is History in the Making!” The coin, developed by CIC Digital, an affiliate of the Trump Organization, has a carefully managed supply structure. The official website shows that CIC Digital and its affiliates own 80% of the total supply, with new tokens scheduled for release over three years. Affiliates will reportedly earn revenue from trading fees as tokens are sold. Within 48 hours of its launch, the TRUMP meme coin reached a $73 billion market cap, briefly surpassing Dogecoin as the largest meme coin. However, its valuation has since dropped to $7.3 billion, according to current data from CoinMarketCap. The very next day, First Lady Melania Trump launched her own meme coin, Melania Meme (MELANIA), which currently holds a $732 million market cap. As Cryptopolitan reported, government ethics watchdogs have raised concerns about the Trump family profiting from their political positions. Despite the backlash though, industry analysts see this as a turning point. Asset manager Bernstein, said, “The launch of a meme coin by the biggest political figure in the world is a massive paradigm shift in how governments view crypto. This could be the beginning of direct engagement with the masses through blockchain technology.” Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis, a proud and renowned Bitcoin supporter in Congress, introduced the Bitcoin Act of 2024 in July to establish a reserve holding 200,000 Bitcoins, worth $2.1 billion at current prices. After Trump’s November 5 win, she tweeted, “We are going to build a strategic Bitcoin reserve.” Yesterday, Lummis met with Eric Trump at the Capitol to discuss plans for the reserve, according to Bloomberg. Eric then took to social media, urging investors to “bet on crypto” as part of their belief in America’s limitless potential. “No question Biden left a mess, but that mess will be corrected, and the next four years are going to be spectacular,” he said, predicting “transformational wealth” under his Dad’s leadership.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. While PEPE and Solana’s Fartcoin target gains, PropiChain is set to steal the spotlight with its potential rise from $0.01 to $3. Table of Contents PEPE and Solana’s Fartcoin PropiChain Why PropiChain could rise from $0.01 to $3 PropiChain’s unique features The PropiChain presale The crypto market is dynamic as ever, with meme coins like PEPE and Solana’s Fartcoin capturing the spotlight with their price surges. Often rooted in humor and online culture, these projects have gained traction among retail investors seeking quick profits. While PEPE aims to use its established meme status, Fartcoin capitalizes on Solana’s high-performance blockchain to drive interest. Both PEPE and Fartcoin have set ambitious targets, drawing attention to their potential. However, their speculative nature raises questions about long-term sustainability. Amid the hype surrounding these meme coins, PropiChain (PCHAIN) is emerging as a serious contender for the top gainer position in the crypto space in Q2 2025. Market experts say PCHAIN is poised to rally from $0.01 to $3. Focused on transforming the real estate industry, estimated to be worth $600 trillion, through blockchain technology, PropiChain offers a utility-driven narrative. PEPE and Solana’s Fartcoin PEPE has become a standout player in the memecoin ecosystem. While the memecoin has evolved into a symbol of community-driven crypto success, the volatile nature of meme-based assets still poses a big concern for investors. The Solana ecosystem has birthed many projects, but few are as notable as Fartcoin . Combining humor with innovation, Solana’s Fartcoin has captured attention with its playful branding and unique tokenomics. Fartcoin’s rise is attributed to its viral marketing campaigns and a strong push from influencers. PropiChain While PEPE and Fartcoin thrive on humor and virality, PCHAIN is carving a niche in the rapidly growing tokenized real estate market. Launched to democratize property ownership, PCHAIN enables users to invest in fractional shares of real estate assets through blockchain technology. The emphasis on tangible utility and real-world application sets PCHAIN apart from meme-based assets. The platform is thus poised to capture a percentage of the $600 trillion real estate market. By deploying blockchain’s transparency and efficiency, PCHAIN aims to lower barriers to entry for real estate investment while providing liquidity to a traditionally illiquid market. Why PropiChain could rise from $0.01 to $3 PCHAIN is positioned for a massive rally that could see early presale investors enjoy over 29,000% ROI. Growing demand for tokenized assets The tokenization of real-world assets is gaining significant traction, with the market projected to hit $16 trillion. PropiChain is well-positioned to capitalize on this shift, offering an easy-to-use platform for both retail and institutional investors. Strategic partnerships PropiChain’s collaborations with established players in the real estate industry add credibility to its model. These partnerships are expected to drive adoption and increase the value of its native token, PCHAIN. Market sentiment As the broader crypto market looks for projects with real-world utility, PCHAIN’s value proposition stands out. You might also like: Promising crypto presale to invest in with potential SHIB style rally in 2025 PropiChain’s unique features PropiChain aims to reshape the real estate industry by using advanced technology to redefine property transactions. The platform will set new standards for buying, selling, and investing in real estate globally with four transformative features: Immersive virtual property exploration The platform will transform how investors and buyers scout properties using cutting-edge Metaverse technology. It will facilitate remote property exploration through immersive 3D virtual tours, overcoming geographical limitations and making real estate investment accessible to a wider audience. By enabling real-time property assessments without physical visits, investors can save time and money. Smart contracts for automated and secure transactions The platform will utilize blockchain-based smart contracts to automate critical real estate processes. These self-executing digital agreements can handle tasks such as ownership transfers, lease management & agreement, and rental payments, significantly reducing the need for intermediaries like brokers and agents. AI-driven investment insights The platform will incorporate artificial intelligence to optimize real estate investment strategies. Its AI-powered virtual assistants and chatbots will provide round-the-clock support, helping investors navigate the real estate market seamlessly. Additionally, its predictive AI system will analyze market trends, predict property value changes, and deliver data-driven recommendations. These insights empower investors to make informed decisions, boosting profitability while minimizing risks. Real estate tokenization for broader investment opportunities PCHAIN will enable the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA), turning physical properties into digital tokens. This approach will allow for fractional ownership of high-value real estate, increasing market liquidity and democratizing access to property investments. The PropiChain presale PropiChain’s focus on real-world utility combined and its potential rally from $0.011 to $3 positions it for the top-gamer position in 2025. The project raised over $1.3 million in the first presale round and has already crossed the $970,000 mark in the ongoing second presale round. This underscores the high confidence of investors in the project’s potential. After this presale round, the token price will rise by over 109% for the third and final presale round. The token is listed on CoinMarketCap , a statement of the project’s readiness to do bigger things in the crypto space. Additionally, BlockAudit , a top blockchain security company, audited the project’s smart contract and certified that it has no vulnerability.

His decision is said to stem from a desire to run for governor of Ohio next year, with the current occupant of the seat, Mike DeWine, ineligible for reelection in 2026 since he is serving his second four-year term in office. A Political Pivot for Ramaswamy It is not the first time Ramaswamy has shown interest in high-profile political roles, having sought the Republican nomination for president in 2024. He had also shown interest in succeeding Vice President JD Vance as the senator for Ohio before Governor DeWine selected his deputy, Jon Husted, to fill the vacancy. His departure from D.O.G.E, first reported by The Associated Press, is in line with the department’s new structural guidelines, which require members to step back from active roles if pursuing elected office. The Cincinnati native has been a vocal advocate for crypto, criticizing the regulatory approach to the assets in the U.S. and even accusing the Biden administration and Wall Street of trying to “suppress” the industry. He praised Grayscale’s victory against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) when it wanted to convert its Bitcoin Trust into a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF), saying the win made it possible to keep BTC and blockchain innovations in the U.S. instead of pushing them overseas. Towards the end of last year, his company, Strive Asset Management, filed for a BTC bond ETF with the SEC that would provide institutional investors and everyday Americans easy access to financial instruments based on the number one cryptocurrency. Musk Left as Sole Leader President Donald Trump appointed the 38-year-old to lead DOGE alongside Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk soon after winning the elections in late 2024. Launched under his “Save America” agenda, Trump formally established the task force via an executive order on the day of his inauguration. It aims to modernize the federal government’s operations by slashing inefficiencies, reducing regulatory red tape, and streamlining government spending. Alongside its bold goals, the initiative drew attention due to its playful acronym, which is similar to the ticker of the largest meme coin by market capitalization, Dogecoin. Incidentally, Musk, who is now its sole leader, is a long-term supporter of Dogecoin, even earning the nickname “Dogefather” for his endorsement of the token. The billionaire businessman recently proposed a public “leaderboard” that would highlight the most egregious examples of government inefficiency, an idea he described as “tragic” and “entertaining.” The post Vivek Ramaswamy Resigns as D.O.G.E Co-Lead to Run for Ohio Governor: Report appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Elon Musk|United States|Vivek Ramaswamy,EN,0,0,DOGE|REGULATION|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-01-21 23:51:43

According to recent Cardano news, its partnership with FC Barcelona through the “Barça Vision” initiative emphasizes blockchain’s critical role in enhancing fan experiences with ADA rewards and NFTs. Meanwhile, Fantom is striving to stabilize its market position, as significant sell-offs by major holders have brought Fantom price volatility into focus. BlockDAG (BDAG) , however, stands out with its ambitious roadmap aimed at nurturing over 200 Web3 projects and organizing global hackathons in collaboration with HackerEarth. Utilizing a vast network of 7.6 million developers, BlockDAG is diligently laying the groundwork for scalable decentralized innovation. With a presale that has amassed over $182 million and BDAG coins currently priced at $0.0248, it represents a prime opportunity for buyers seeking significant returns. Cardano News: FC Barcelona Partnership Aims to Enhance Fan Engagement Recent Cardano news has seen it penetrate the sports sector through a partnership with FC Barcelona, unveiled on January 10, 2025, under the club’s “Barça Vision” initiative. This partnership is set to revolutionize fan engagement by leveraging blockchain technology to offer new employment opportunities, educational initiatives in blockchain, and a rewards system featuring ADA tokens and NFTs. This announcement propelled Cardano’s ADA token up by 4%, reaching $0.95, despite facing a 11% decline earlier in the week due to broader market conditions. Cardano continues to hold its position as the 9th largest cryptocurrency globally, with a market cap of $33.5 billion, indicating a growing ecosystem. This collaboration underscores the transformative potential of blockchain in professional sports, with ADA playing an integral role. Its practical applications and increasing adoption offer substantial growth opportunities for stakeholders in cutting-edge digital assets. Fantom (FTM) Price Encounters Challenges Amid Whale Sell-Off Fantom’s price has experienced a slight 3% recovery in the last 24 hours, though it remains down 20% over the past week as it attempts to counter a prevailing bearish trend. The Average Directional Index (ADX), which quantifies trend strength, has decreased to 31.4, indicating a weakening of the downtrend and a potential shift towards market stabilization. Further, a significant reduction in large holder activity has heightened selling pressure, with the number of wallets holding between 1 million and 10 million FTM decreasing from 84 to 69 over the week, impacting market liquidity. Fantom’s price is now teetering around $0.618 at a pivotal support level. Should it fall below, the price might test the lower support at $0.50; conversely, a rebound could elevate FTM towards the $0.879 resistance mark. Fantom remains a digital asset worth monitoring as it strives for stability and momentum. BlockDAG’s Ambitious Vision: Over 200 Web3 Projects & Worldwide Hackathons BlockDAG is gearing up for an impactful year with grand plans, including a significant partnership with HackerEarth. This alliance will see BlockDAG host four international hackathons, aiming to involve 10,000 to 15,000 developers from HackerEarth’s extensive network of 7.6 million tech experts. These hackathons are designed to foster innovation and develop a diverse global community of developers. BlockDAG’s overarching goal is to catalyze the creation of over 200 Web3 projects within its network, giving developers opportunities to innovate, test, and deploy state-of-the-art decentralized applications (dApps) while demonstrating BlockDAG Network’s distinctive capabilities. With a definitive roadmap and a strong vision for the future, BlockDAG is proving to be an increasingly appealing choice. Analysts estimate that BDAG, with a current price of $0.0248, could potentially escalate to $1 by 2025. Its sophisticated technology, expanding ecosystem, and practical utility are attracting buyers searching for premier opportunities in today’s crypto market. The enthusiasm continues as BlockDAG’s presale has already raised over $182 million and is swiftly progressing towards its $600 million target. As more developers engage and enrich the ecosystem, BlockDAG is solidifying its role as a fundamental player in the Web3 realm. The prospects for both developers and users delving into decentralized options with BlockDAG are looking increasingly promising. Best Altcoins for 2025 While Cardano and Fantom each navigate their distinct challenges and prospects, BlockDAG ascends as the definitive platform for growth and innovation in blockchain. Its lofty ambitions, such as hosting hackathons and expanding its Web3 project ecosystem, underscore its commitment to scalability and utility. Analysts predict that BDAG could reach $1 by 2025, supported by robust presale results and a developer-centric strategy. For those aiming to capitalize on the forthcoming major waves in the crypto world, BlockDAG presents the most compelling proposition, offering both short-term potential and a long-term vision that cements its leadership in the Web3 revolution.

Its unique sharding technology enables easy processing of millions of transactions, making Near Protocol (NEAR) a top contender for decentralized applications. The renowned analyst predicts that Near Protocol (NEAR) will experience a massive surge from its current price of $5.32 as developers flock to its platform. Its user-friendly design, low transaction fees, and eco-friendly consensus mechanism make it a prime choice for Web3 projects.

However, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is drawing more attention with its under $0.5 token poised to jump to $5 upon its launch. WallitIQ (WLTQ): A Game Changer In The World Of DeFi While the recent Shiba Inu price prediction has made headlines, the ongoing WallitIQ (WLTQ) is experiencing a high influx of investors looking to make significant gains given the token’s potential to rise from its under $0.05 presale price to $5 in the shortest period the crypto market has ever seen. The primary objective of WallitIQ (WLTQ) is to promote financial literacy, security, and decentralization among crypto enthusiasts through AI solutions and machine learning algorithms. According to most crypto experts, the increase in demand for efficient and secure wallet solutions positions WallitIQ (WLTQ) for rapid success in the booming billion-dollar crypto wallet and AI market. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) projected $10 million in monthly revenue has attracted both retail and institutional investors looking to secure their spots in the ongoing presale. While investors who joined the presale from the first stage have already secured gains of over 150%, those who chose to join now will also receive several benefits, such as governance participation, premium features, and quick returns due to token price appreciation in the following stage of the presale. In addition to its potential rise from under $0.05 to $5, WallitIQ (WLTQ) provides round-the-clock blockchain activities for its users, which include yield farming, trading of over 2,000 cryptocurrencies, and staking mechanisms that yield significant returns of up to 180% for token holders.

As a platform that prioritizes security in DeFi, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has undergone a thorough smart contract audit conducted by SolidProof , a cybersecurity and blockchain audit firm known for protecting blockchain projects and financial institutions from any cyber attack. To further bolster user confidence, WallitIQ (WLTQ) employs the advanced encryption standard (AES) and elliptic cryptographic curve (ECC) to protect its users’ transactions and private keys from unauthorized devices or individuals. The Potential Shiba Inu Price Surge To $5 The significant increase in the Shiba Inu burn rate signifies the growing interest in its community to reduce its supply, leading analysts to project that it will trigger the Shiba Inu price surge to $0.05. According to a post from X (formerly Twitter) by Shibburn, a total of 44,623,604,014 SHIB were burned in 2024, which further contributed to a yearly increase of 149% in the Shiba Inu price. Trading alongside the broader crypto market, the Shiba Inu price has also gained momentum as Bitcoin retests the $100,000 price mark. The Shiba Inu price has been up 3.8% on the weekly charts, aiming to climb higher amidst the imminent meme frenzy. Data obtained from CoinGecko shows that SHIB has a market of $13.4 billion with a daily trading volume of $730 million. As of the time of this writing, the Shiba Inu price is trading at $0.00002284. Join The WallitIQ (WLTQ) Presale WallitIQ (WLTQ) is currently in the third stage of its presale, with millions of tokens sold and over $6 million raised in just a few months. In anticipation of its official launch, smart investors are rapidly buying the WallitIQ native token (WLTQ) for a low price of $0.0420 each in order to secure substantial gains from its projected rise to $5. Following the growing presale momentum, most crypto experts strongly believe the WallitIQ (WLTQ) would come to an end sooner than expected.

Initially launched in October with a goal of selling only 20 billion WLF tokens, the decentralized finance’s (DeFi) venture token surpassed this target by selling 21 billion tokens, demonstrating robust demand despite a rocky start. Eric Trump Champions World Liberty Financial At ‘High-Profile Event’ Per the report, this surge in interest comes as WLF announces the release of an additional 5 billion tokens from its total supply of 100 billion, citing “massive demand and overwhelming interest.” The Trump family’s foray into the cryptocurrency space has been marked by a blend of enthusiasm and controversy. Over the weekend, both Donald Trump and his wife, Melania, launched their own memecoins, which experienced rapid spikes in value. Related Reading: $24 XRP Prediction: Bitcoin Maxi Calls It Risky But Possible Eric Trump, actively promoting World Liberty Financial, also attended a “high-profile crypto event” in Washington, celebrating the intersection of politics and digital assets as his father prepares for a new administration. Trump’s embrace of the crypto sector during his election campaign has resonated with industry executives, many of whom anticipate a more favorable regulatory environment compared to the policies of the outgoing Biden administration. The appointment of crypto-friendly figures, such as Paul Atkins to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and David Sacks as the newly created artificial intelligence (AI) and Crypto Czar, further underscores this potential shift. However, the venture has not been without its critics. Trump’s Memecoins Spark Controversy Concerns arise over the limited rights associated with WLF tokens, which provide holders with only minimal voting rights and no economic entitlements. Furthermore, the tokens cannot be traded or sold back to WLF, leading to questions about their long-term value and utility. Compounding the intrigue surrounding WLF, notable crypto entrepreneur and TRON blockchain founder Justin Sun recently revealed a significant investment of $45 million into the venture, raising his total stake to $75 million. The market’s reaction has been volatile, exemplified by Bitcoin’s brief spike to a record high of over $109,000 on Monday, followed by a retraction toward $102,000 after Trump’s inauguration speech. Analysts now speculate that upcoming executive orders from Trump could bolster the crypto industry’s fortunes in the US, although skepticism lingers among some industry veterans. Nic Carter, a venture capitalist, articulated concerns about the “ethical implications” of a sitting president engaging in business ventures that could be perceived as “conflicts of interest.” Related Reading: This Analyst Correctly Predicted The Bitcoin Price Crash To $99,000, Here’s What’s Supposed To Happen Next The launch of Trump’s memecoins has also stirred controversy, with the Donald Trump memecoin experiencing a sharp decline from a weekend high of $75 to $52. Meanwhile, the Melania Trump memecoin, which disrupted the market dynamics of the Donald coin, saw its value fluctuate significantly from a high of $13.64 to $8.43. Bernstein analysts have noted that this “chaotic crypto era” marks a critical juncture, suggesting that government engagement with cryptocurrencies may redefine the relationship between leadership and emerging technologies. The analysts assert that the launch of Trump and Melania’s memecoins signifies a potential regulatory shift in the country, where digital assets could serve as a direct connection to a mass audience.

Currently priced at $0.000026, Arctic Pablo’s presale has already raised over $200,000 in just 12 days, proving that investors are excited about this unique concept. Each presale phase represents a new location, with Pablo traveling from the frosty peaks of the Metropolis to his next destination, Snowy Shores. While other meme coins are content with generic presales, Arctic Pablo creates a sense of adventure and urgency, inviting investors to get in early and stake their claim. What’s the catch? Well, Arctic Pablo’s presale isn’t structured in the usual “stages.” Instead, it’s divided into locations, each representing a new realm of hidden treasures. Metropolis’s current location is already showing off an incredible 30,692% ROI from the 4th stage to the projected listing price of $0.008. As Arctic Pablo’s journey unfolds, early investors are positioned to see explosive returns—so the question is, are you ready to take the ride? If you were to invest $800 in Arctic Pablo at the current presale price of $0.000026, you’d receive a massive $30,718,984.00 APC. When the token hits its launch price of $0.008, your initial investment would balloon to $245,751.872. With numbers like that, it’s easy to see why Arctic Pablo is quickly climbing the ranks of the best meme coins to invest in for short-term gains. Just a Chill Guy: The Cool Cat of Meme Coins Next on our list is Just a Chill Guy (CHILLGUY), a meme coin that brings a laid-back vibe to the crypto scene. Currently priced at $0.07067, CHILLGUY has seen some fluctuations in price, with a recent drop of 16.67%. Despite these ups and downs, CHILLGUY remains a favorite within the Solana and Pump Fun ecosystems, boasting a market cap of around $70.67 million. What makes CHILLGUY stand out? Well, its roots in meme culture and a strong community keep it relevant, even in volatile markets. However, while Just a Chill Guy has made its mark, it doesn’t have the same kind of explosive ROI potential that Arctic Pablo currently offers. At its all-time high of $0.6651, it has since experienced an 89.39% decline, showing that while CHILLGUY may have potential, it doesn’t carry the same level of excitement as Arctic Pablo’s innovative approach. While Just a Chill Guy has a solid fanbase and a market cap that reflects its popularity, Arctic Pablo’s presale model and ongoing journey through unique locations put it on track to outpace meme coins like CHILLGUY in the long run. The potential for ROI with Arctic Pablo far outweighs what CHILLGUY offers, making it one of the best meme coins to buy today. Brett: The Meme Coin on the Rise Let’s now take a look at Brett (Based), another popular meme coin that’s been gaining traction. Priced at $0.09027, Brett has seen a 10.37% decline in the last 24 hours. Despite this, it’s still managed to maintain a market cap of around $889.71 million. With a max supply nearing 10 billion coins and a circulating supply of just under 10 billion, Brett is one of the larger meme coins in terms of market cap. While Brett has certainly shown its potential with a significant rise of 83,764.37% from its all-time low, it has not been able to maintain the same consistent upward momentum that Arctic Pablo boasts. The coin’s recent 61.59% drop from its all-time high of $0.235 reflects some of the volatility that can affect larger meme coins. Still, despite its large supply and strong market cap, Brett (Based) doesn’t provide the kind of innovative opportunity that Arctic Pablo does with its unique presale model and high ROI potential. If you’re looking for the best meme coin to buy today, Brett may seem like a solid investment, but Arctic Pablo’s out-of-the-box approach to presale locations and its jaw-dropping ROI numbers should make it the clear frontrunner. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo stands out as the best meme coin to buy today. Its unique presale model, innovative narrative, and astronomical ROI potential make it a top contender for short-term investments. With over $200,000 already raised, Arctic Pablo’s journey through mystical locations offers investors a thrilling ride that other meme coins like Just a Chill Guy and Brett simply can’t match. The opportunity to buy in early at $0.000026 and watch your investment grow as Arctic Pablo nears its launch price of $0.008 is too good to ignore. With a 66% APY staking program, investors can see their investments grow even further while being part of an exciting adventure that bridges myth and reality. If you want to be part of this exciting journey and maximize your ROI, join the Arctic Pablo presale now and stake your claim in one of the best meme coins to invest in for short-term gains.

39276474,https://timestabloid.com/?p=55189,1737504218,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Top Crypto Proponent Calls $100 XRP Price. Here’s the Timeline,https://timestabloid.com/top-crypto-proponent-calls-100-per-xrp-heres-the-timeline/,"A recent tweet by JackTheRippler, a well-known cryptocurrency commentator, has sparked widespread discussion within the XRP community. The tweet, reading simply, ”$100 per #XRP this year. YES or NO?”, has garnered responses from various enthusiasts on X (formerly Twitter), who shared their perspectives on whether this milestone is achievable for XRP in 2025. The conversation underscores the heightened anticipation surrounding XRP and its potential adoption in cross-border payments and broader financial systems. Two notable replies highlight different perspectives on the feasibility of XRP reaching such a valuation this year. Community Perspectives One respondent, Seek 1st, tied the possibility of a $100 XRP price to the growth of activity on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). They stated, “It all depends on how much traffic there will be on XRPL by year’s end. We know how many potential vehicles will eventually be running but how fast is the adoption?” This comment reflects a common view that XRP’s price growth is contingent upon real-world utility, particularly through increased usage of the XRPL for transactions. Seek 1st further suggested that macroeconomic factors and potential policy changes could play a significant role, mentioning former U.S. President Donald Trump’s potential influence: “We may know a lot more by the end of this month after Trump gives an update.” This highlights how cryptocurrency enthusiasts closely watch broader financial and political developments as potential catalysts for market changes. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Another user, Nicolas Soria, took a more optimistic stance, pointing to the potential for XRP to become the standard for cross-border transactions. Soria wrote , “If implementation of XRP becomes the norm of all cross-border transactions at every major financial institution, then I think it might go higher than that this year.” This comment underscores the transformative potential of XRP’s adoption in the global financial ecosystem, provided institutions continue integrating the asset into their operations. Soria also hinted at rumors of forthcoming executive orders that may benefit the crypto market, writing, “Rumor has it that there are going to be executive orders signed that are very pro-crypto to begin economic recovery.” While these claims remain unverified, they reflect the optimism within the XRP community about regulatory developments favoring the broader adoption of digital assets. The debate sparked by JackTheRippler’s tweet highlights the blend of cautious optimism and bold speculation that defines the XRP community. While many agree that the potential for significant price growth exists, much hinges on real-world adoption, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic factors. As 2025 progresses, these variables will continue to shape XRP’s performance, keeping the community closely engaged in the asset’s journey.

Table of Contents Rexas Finance Nodle Bifrost Shiden Network KILT Protocol Conclusion 2025 is giving bullish sentiment with Donald Trump as the new U.S. president. Investors are looking to position themselves in order to capitalize on this bullish trend, and top analysts have identified some of the coins with the potential to drive riches. Rexas Finance, Nodle, Bifrost, Shiden Network, and KILT Protocol have stood out. Of the five, Rexas Finance is making waves with its transformative approach to real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and its selling out presale. Rexas Finance Rexas Finance has caught the eye of both investors and analysts due to its focus on RWA tokenization. This is a new way of tokenizing physical and digital assets, offering fractional ownership and greater liquidity. RXS is in Stage 11 of its presale, which is currently priced at $0.175, having already raised $36,381,133 out of its $41 million funding target. The presale has been on a lot of people’s radar, with 399 million tokens already bought out of a total of 425 million. Rexas Finance is listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, further boosting confidence. The project also has a Certik audit , showing that it takes its security and transparency seriously. As the presale continues, RXS could soar to incredible price heights in 2025. Nodle Another cryptocurrency that is picking up speed is Nodle, which is worth about $0.00247. Nodle has gotten investors looking for potential growth, witnessing a price increase of almost 8% in the past 24 hours. Analysts believe that Nodle could offer an ROI of about 320%. Therefore, as a decentralized wireless network, it is well-placed to take advantage of the steadily increasing demand. Bifrost Built on Bifrost’s proprietary technology, which aims to bridge different blockchain ecosystems, the token is currently trading at $0.2162, with minor growth of 1.62% over the past week. It is anticipated that it will scale to the all-time high (ATH) of $0.81, around 300% growth.

With privacy and security of digital interactions remaining an issue, KILT’s decentralized identity solutions come at the right time.

Ulbricht created the online black marketplace in 2011, which facilitated the anonymous sale of illegal drugs and illicit goods using Bitcoin as a method of payment. After his arrest in 2013, Ulbricht received a double life sentence plus 40 years without the possibility of parole, which was significantly harsher than many individuals who sold illicit goods on Silk Road or similar platforms. Now, with Ulbricht at age 40, President Trump has issued an unconditional pardon and a statement on Truth Social. “I just called the mother of Ross William Ulbricht to let her know that in honor of her and the Libertarian Movement, which supported me so strongly, it was my pleasure to have just signed a full and unconditional pardon of her son, Ross. The scum that worked to convict him were some of the same lunatics who were involved in the modern day weaponization of government against me. He was given two life sentences, plus 40 years. Ridiculous!” Ulbricht’s mantra for Silk Road centered on principles of personal freedom and individual sovereignty. He touted a marketplace free from government oversight, where people could trade freely as long as no harm was directly caused to others. That philosophy was reflected in Silk Road’s inconsistently enforced and often ignored terms and conditions, which prohibited listings for items explicitly intended to harm others, such as stolen goods, child exploitation material or weapons intended for violence.

Is it the strength of its community, the exciting developments behind it, or the growth potential? If we look at DOGS (DOGS) and PUDGY Penguins (PENGU), it’s clear that these coins are facing some challenges. DOGS has dropped by 22.5% in the past week, while PENGU has seen a 28.8% decline. This has left many investors looking for the next big opportunity. Enter BTFD Coin, which has emerged as a major contender in the meme coin world. The BTFD Coin presale has already made waves, currently in Stage 14, and it’s rapidly catching the attention of savvy investors. With over $5.4 million raised, 65 billion coins sold, and over 8,900 bulls backing it, BTFD Coin is on the rise. This article will explore why BTFD Coin is one of the top new meme coin presales to invest in today , and why now is the perfect time to jump on board. BTFD Coin: The Presale Sensation Ready to Rocket Why is BTFD Coin getting so much attention? It’s not just another meme coin; BTFD Coin is proving to be a powerhouse in the presale market. With its current price of $0.0001600, BTFD Coin offers an incredible entry point for investors. The coin’s presale has already seen massive success, with more than 65 billion coins sold and $5.4 million raised. And as the presale enters Stage 14, investors are looking at significant upside potential. At the moment, BTFD Coin is in a unique position. The project is not only backed by a strong and growing community but also offers staking rewards that can yield up to 90% APY, along with a P2E game that was launched in full on January 1, 2025. The future of BTFD Coin looks bright, and analysts are predicting significant price growth after the coin is listed, which adds further to the excitement. As Stage 14 is here, the demand for BTFD Coin is only expected to rise, especially with the announcement of unsold tokens being burned from Stage 13. To make this opportunity even more appealing, the BTFD Coin presale is offering a 100% bonus with the code LAUNCH100 . This means that for every $BTFD purchased in stage 14, buyers will receive double the tokens—an offer too good to pass up for anyone looking to own the dip. With an investment of $3000 in BTFD Coin at the current price of $0.0001600 in Stage 14, you’d receive 18,750,000 tokens. Thanks to the 100% bonus (using the code LAUNCH100 ), your tokens would double to 37,500,000. If the price increases to $0.0006 when the coin is listed, your $3000 investment could grow to $22,500, offering a substantial return.

Dogs: A Vibrant Community But Struggling to Gain Momentum Dogs (DOGS) has a strong community and an interesting project built on the TON Blockchain, but the coin is facing some hurdles. Currently trading at $0.000332, DOGS has experienced a 22.5% drop over the past week, leaving some investors wondering where the price is headed. The project’s reliance on Telegram’s vast user base and its focus on tokenized stickers provides some unique features, but the coin’s recent price movement suggests that it’s struggling to maintain upward momentum. Despite these challenges, the DOGS community remains dedicated, and there’s potential for future growth. Analysts are predicting that DOGS could reach $0.00040 by 2025, which is a positive sign for the future. Pudgy Penguins: Can It Recover from Recent Losses? Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) has established itself as a cultural icon in the meme coin space, with a massive following and millions of views across various platforms. Despite this, the coin is facing a 28.8% decline over the past week, and its trading volume has decreased by 47.6%. Currently priced at $0.02368, PENGU has seen a dramatic fall from its ATH of $0.05738 in December 2024. While Pudgy Penguins remains a well-known project with a strong community, it’s clear that the coin is facing challenges in the current market. As with DOGS, the coin’s performance will depend on its ability to recover and regain investor confidence. The Final Thoughts Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin stands out as one of the top new meme coin presales to invest in today. The presale’s success, combined with its strong community and unique rewards system, makes it an attractive opportunity for investors.

Ethena: Positioned for a Potential Breakout Ethena (ENA) is currently trading between $0.71 and $0.99. With a 10% increase over the last week, it's drawing renewed interest. Its relative strength index is close to 50, indicating balanced momentum. Ethena's impressive growth of over 90% in the past six months signals strong potential. The next hurdle is at $1.14, which could lead to a 20% rise from the top end of the current range. Surpassing this level could propel it to $1.42, marking a substantial jump from current prices. Support at $0.58 offers some stability, but breaking through resistance will be key for any rally. Positive sentiment and strong momentum seem to be pushing Ethena towards a bright future. Shiro Neko: Building Momentum for a Significant Price Increase Shiro Neko (SHIRO) is showing a promising upward trend. Currently priced between $0.0000000261 and $0.0000000925, it's nearing its 100-day average. The closest resistance is at $0.0000001349, and surpassing this could lead to notable gains. With momentum on its side, SHIRO might reach the next resistance level at $0.0000002013, potentially nearly doubling from its current upper range. The MACD is slightly positive, suggesting a continued price increase. SHIRO's upward movement excites traders who believe in its growth potential during this expected altcoin season. Chill Guy (CHILLGUY): Could a Rebound Be Imminent? Chill Guy (CHILLGUY) has been on a turbulent journey, trading between $0.07 and $0.13. It recently suffered a steep decline, losing over 50% in the past month. However, the RSI indicates it’s not overly oversold. Immediate resistance sits at $0.17, with a major obstacle at $0.23. Breaking these barriers could lead to gains of 30% to 70%. The coin is close to its 10-day moving average, suggesting potential for upward movement if momentum gathers. Yet, with an 81.84% drop over the past six months, caution is advised. The road ahead may be challenging, but if bullish sentiment returns, CHILLGUY could make a surprising comeback. Super Trump (STRUMP): On the Verge of a Potential Surge? Super Trump (STRUMP) might be gearing up for a significant move. Its current price ranges from about $0.00179 to $0.00427, well below recent highs, indicating possible room for growth.

If it can break the $0.00562 resistance level, it could aim for $0.00809. Despite a decline over the past week and month, this correction phase might set the stage for a powerful upswing. Stay alert for any signs of a bullish trend. Conclusion While ENA, SHIRO, CHILLGUY, and STRUMP may show limited short-term potential, Catzilla stands out as the ultimate meme coin hero aimed at providing financial freedom for all.

Trump, 78, announced the decision on Truth Social, sharing that he personally informed Ulbricht’s mother of the news. The president wrote: “I just called the mother of Ross William Ulbricht to let her know that in honor of her and the Libertarian Movement, which supported me so strongly, it was my pleasure to have just signed a full and unconditional pardon of her son, Ross.” Ulbricht had been serving two life sentences plus 40 years without parole at a maximum-security prison in Arizona since 2015. His charges stemmed from running Silk Road, a notorious darknet marketplace that facilitated illegal transactions, mostly paid for in Bitcoin a long time ago. Trump called Ulbricht’s punishment “ridiculous” and blamed “leftist lunatics” for what he described as a politically motivated conviction. Ulbricht’s arrest in San Francisco in October 2013 became a watershed moment in the intersection of cryptocurrency and law enforcement. Using the alias “Dread Pirate Roberts,” Ulbricht launched Silk Road in 2011. The platform allowed users to buy and sell illegal goods, including drugs, using Bitcoin for anonymity. Prosecutors accused him of profiting millions in Bitcoin and charged him with drug trafficking, money laundering, and conspiracy to commit hacking. In 2015, a New York jury found Ulbricht guilty on all counts, leading to one of the harshest sentences ever handed down for such crimes. Despite many appeals, including one to the Supreme Court, Ulbricht remained imprisoned until Trump’s unexpected decision. Trump’s pardon followed a letter from Senator Rand Paul, who urged Trump to act. “I write to urge you to follow through on your stated intention to commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht. Mr. Ulbricht is serving two life sentences plus forty years without parole for nonviolent offenses related to the website he launched in early 2011. Like so many others, I am shocked by the harsh sentence imposed on this first-time offender,” Paul wrote, describing the sentence as “vastly disproportionate” to the crimes. He added that even the most notorious drug dealers using the platform received lighter penalties. Paul’s intervention is believed to have been a key in Trump’s decision to grant the pardon. The self-proclaimed ‘crypto president’ said, “The scum that worked to convict Trump were some of the same lunatics who were involved in the modern day weaponization of government against me. He was given two life sentences, plus 40 years.

39276475,https://timestabloid.com/?p=55191,1737506312,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Top Pundit Feels “Something Huge Is Coming for XRP”,https://timestabloid.com/top-pundit-feels-something-huge-is-coming-for-xrp/,"Edo Farina, CEO of Alpha Lion Academy, recently expressed a strong conviction regarding the future of XRP, stating , “I have a feeling something HUGE is coming for $XRP.” This assertion aligns with a series of significant developments surrounding XRP in recent months, which may substantiate Farina’s optimism. As of January 20, 2025, XRP is trading at $3.08, reflecting a slight decrease of 0.32% from the previous close. The cryptocurrency reached an intraday high of $3.34 and a low of $2.90. Notably, XRP achieved an all-time high of $3.40 recently, surpassing the $3.00 threshold for the first time since 2018. Regulatory Shifts and Market Trends Supporting XRP Several factors have contributed to XRP’s recent upward trajectory. The anticipation of regulatory changes under the new U.S. administration has played a pivotal role. With the inauguration of President Donald Trump, there is speculation about a shift in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) stance towards cryptocurrencies. The nomination of Paul Atkins, known for his pro-crypto views , as the new SEC Chair, suggests a potential easing of regulatory pressures. This development is particularly relevant to Ripple Labs Inc., a company engaged in a legal dispute with the SEC since 2020. The lawsuit alleged that XRP was sold as an unregistered security. However, a federal judge ruled in July 2023 that XRP is not a security when sold to the general public on digital-asset exchanges, though sales to institutional investors were considered unregistered securities transactions. The prospect of a more favorable regulatory environment under the new administration has bolstered investor confidence. Market dynamics have also played a significant role in XRP’s performance. The recent decline in the U.S. core inflation rate has led to expectations that the Federal Reserve might reduce interest rates, creating a more conducive environment for cryptocurrency investments. Furthermore, the introduction of new Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) that hold actual cryptocurrencies, rather than futures, has provided traditional investors with more accessible avenues to invest in digital assets, thereby increasing demand. Institutional Interest Driving XRP Adoption Institutional interest in XRP has seen a notable uptick. WisdomTree, a U.S.-based investment fund manager, launched the WisdomTree Physical XRP ETP on several European exchanges, including Deutsche Börse Xetra, SIX Swiss Exchange, and Euronext in Paris and Amsterdam. This Exchange-Traded Product (ETP), with a management fee of 0.50%, is the most cost-effective ETP in Europe for gaining exposure to XRP. The product is fully backed by XRP and offers dual custody for enhanced security. This move by WisdomTree reflects a growing institutional recognition of XRP’s potential. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Additionally, activist approaches toward crypto investments have emerged. GAM, a Swiss asset manager, has urged Japan’s SBI Holdings to adopt a more proactive strategy regarding its substantial cryptocurrency investments, particularly its significant holdings in Ripple Labs and XRP. GAM’s fund managers have criticized SBI for a lack of transparency and strategic direction concerning its Ripple investments, suggesting measures such as disclosing daily values of XRP holdings and establishing a public XRP coin buyback program. This activist stance underscores the increasing importance of strategic management of crypto assets by institutional investors. Edo Farina’s anticipation of XRP’s significant growth is backed by favorable regulatory prospects, positive market dynamics, and growing institutional interest. These factors collectively contribute to an optimistic outlook for XRP’s future trajectory. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Pepe Loves Bezos (PEPEBEZO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEBEZO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Loves Bezos can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Loves Bezos could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Loves Bezos launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Loves Bezos on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Loves Bezos by entering its contract address – 5fminHHGkusginuqs4jjR2qivagMWWBStM2Hs21HVLcm – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEBEZO. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|DOGE|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-22 00:42:44

The company matched its expansion to the launch of the European Union’s MiCA rules, which lay out clear regulations for crypto businesses. Robinhood Crypto Sets Foot in Spain, Boosting EU Market Presence In a recent announcement on the X platform, Robinhood revealed the launch of its crypto services in Spain as of January 2025. This expansion is part of the company’s strategy to enhance its presence within the EU and the UK’s financial markets. The entry into Spain allows Robinhood to offer its users in the region a variety of services, including crypto trading, staking, and investing. The launch coincides with Robinhood’s efforts to comply with the EU’s MiCA regulations, ensuring a regulated and secure environment for its customers. Last year, Robinhood set the stage for this expansion by introducing crypto transfer capabilities in Europe. This move allowed users to deposit and withdraw over two dozen tokens—a feature highly anticipated by its European user base.’ Co-founder of Robinhood, Vlad Tenev commented, “We remain focused on providing industry-leading products that serve far more of customers’ financial needs, gaining market share, expanding internationally, and continuing to change the industry for the better.” Apart from Robinhood’s EU expansion, another crypto exchange, CryptoCom, has made strides by securing an in-principle MiCA license . This approval allows CryptoCom to operate across all 27 EU member states under the new regulatory framework. Regulatory Challenges and Strategic Adjustments Additionally, recently, the top crypto exchange agreed to a $45 million settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over several regulatory violations. These included failing to maintain and preserve communication records, as well as neglecting to implement adequate measures to prevent identity theft. The SEC also cited insufficient cybersecurity practices as a major concern. The settlement, split between Robinhood Securities and Robinhood Financial, underscores the firm’s commitment to fortifying its operational integrity. More so, the firm’s proactive measures in addressing these challenges are crucial for maintaining trust and reliability among its users. Expanding Reach and Integrating Trending Assets As part of its continued growth strategy, Robinhood has also made a significant addition to its trading platform by listing the TRUMP meme coin on its spot trading market. This new listing, based on the Solana blockchain, diversifies the assets available on the exchange and taps into the growing interest in meme coins. The inclusion of the TRUMP meme coin will enhance user engagement and attract a broader audience. This reflects the crypto exchange ability to adapt to market trends while expanding its service offerings in Spain and across Europe.

""I just called the mother of Ross William Ulbricht to let her know that in honor of her and the Libertarian Movement, which supported me so strongly, it was my pleasure to have just signed a full and unconditional pardon of her son, Ross,"" Trump wrote on a Truth Social post. The move assures an imminent release for Ulbricht, who in 2015 was convicted of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise and distributing narcotics, along with a host of related crimes, via his operation of the darknet Silk Road marketplace. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Ulbricht's case has become a cause célèbre for many in the crypto community who note he did not himself sell drugs or other illegal items but instead operated a platform where others were allowed to transact. Then-candidate Trump promised a ""Day One"" commutation of Ulbricht's sentence last May while addressing the Libertarian Party convention The price of bitcoin (BTC) rose in the minutes following the news, possibly as the pardon, along with a flurry of executive orders over the past hours, signals the president's intention to follow through on campaign promises.

Trader Ali Martinez tells his 116,800 followers on the social media platform X that while retail investors are getting distracted by the recently launched Official Trump ( TRUMP ) memecoin, crypto whales heavily accumulated DOGE to the tune of $640.5 million in just two days. “While everyone focuses on TRUMP, whales bought 1.83 billion Dogecoin DOGE in [48 hours!]” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, DOGE is trading for $0.35. Looking at TRUMP itself, Martinez predicts that the memecoin will surge above $50 if it takes out the diagonal resistance of a falling wedge pattern. A falling wedge structure is often viewed as a bullish reversal pattern as it suggests that selling pressure is losing momentum. “TRUMP seems to be forming a falling wedge on the lower time frames, suggesting a potential consolidation toward the apex before a rebound to $54.” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, TRUMP is worth $32.48. As for the Solana ( SOL )-based meme token dogwifhat ( WIF ), the trader thinks the altcoin is moving inside a large parallel channel – a pattern suggesting that the asset is in a sideways trend as it respects both the support and resistance levels. With WIF trading close to the pattern’s support level at $1.35, Martinez believes that it’s almost time for the altcoin to spark rallies. “We could see further consolidation around the channel’s lower boundary before an upswing toward $5!” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, WIF is worth $1.37.

According to reports, the Ethereum Foundation has recently moved a substantial amount of Ether. The foundation’s transactions to move and sell its tokens became messier when one of its employees attempted to explain the situation, generating a lot of backlash. Related Reading: $24 XRP Prediction: Bitcoin Maxi Calls It Risky But Possible Ethereum’s recent transactions have occurred since Bitcoin and other top tokens have been ripping through the charts. Price-wise, Ethereum is trading between $3,200 and $3,384, which is too far from 2021’s high of $4,870. What’s Up, Ethereum Foundation? The Ethereum Foundation, the primary organization supporting the development of the blockchain, is not helping the cause. Regardless of its intention or the overriding objectives for unloading massive ETH tranches, these moves still leave a bad taste in the mouths of most holders and supporters. According to a recent post by Spot On Chain on Twitter/X, the foundation has recently moved another 100 ETH in exchange for 336,475 DAI. According to the account, the foundation sold 200 ETH tokens for $67k in the first few days of 2025 at an average cost of $3,361. The account added that ETH is 31% below its 2021 high of $4,878, while Bitcoin continues to retest its highs and currently breached the $109k level.

Stark, a popular ETH supporter, defended the foundation’s decision to sell these ETH tokens, arguing that they’re still actively using the blockchain’s native token. the EF uses Ethereum all the time, for instance to (1) swap ETH for stables (usually @CoWSwap) and (2) to pay people (grantees, team members) in stables and ETH, on mainnet and L2s. Events we run (like Devcon and Devconnect) take onchain payments and use onchain ID for tickets. — Josh Stark (@0xstark) January 20, 2025 In a Twitter/X posting, Stark explained that the foundation uses its tokens every time. These tokens buy stablecoins, pay their people in stablecoins, and support the blockchain’s events. Stark’s comments didn’t sit well with some crypto observers and commentators. Twitter/X user WazzCrypto hit Stark for using ETH “dump” as an explanation to support the foundation’s transactions. User @VelvetMilkman was disappointed with Stark, arguing that it’s a lame excuse for using the altcoins. Meanwhile, X user Trading_Axe has a more scathing, and no holds barred take on the issue: Their brains actually do not work at all. The fuck you need 300K for so urgently? What could you POSSIBLY, as the ETHEREUM FOUNDATION, when the entire world is watching, need 300K OF A PUBLIC SELL ORDER for? Mindless cockroaches.

The increasing number of comments and criticisms against the foundation has caught the attention of Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s co-founder. Buterin said the team has also explored many options, including staking their tokens. However, regulatory issues and potential problems with the hard fork prevented them from doing so. Although there’s a friendly regulatory environment right now, the risks associated with staking remain high.

39278155,https://timestabloid.com/?p=55193,1737509538,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"What is self-exclusion in online gambling, and how does it help players?",https://timestabloid.com/what-is-self-exclusion-in-online-gambling-and-how-does-it-help-players/,"Over 94 million people gamble online regularly every year. Of this number, about 25.6 percent reported having a gambling problem in 2023. This is up 101 percent from 2014, when 12.7 percent of respondents said they were addicted to gambling. As online casino games grow more accessible, so does the risk of problem gambling. Operators like Betway, governments, and regulators have turned to self-exclusion to help problem gamblers remain safe online. Let’s review what it is and how it works. What is self-exclusion? Self-exclusion is a voluntary program in which bettors can request to be banned from online gambling platforms for a given period. Many regulators and operators, like the betway casino , offer self-exclusion services to help online gamblers address and resolve problem gambling tendencies. By self-excluding from gambling platforms, you limit your exposure to gambling and reduce the harm of addiction. Self-exclusion often works in tandem with other problem gambling solutions, including: Therapy and counseling Support groups Budgetary restrictions If successful, self-exclusion can limit your risk of the impacts of addiction gambling, including emotional distress, personal relationship strains, and financial loss. Within the igaming industry, offering self-exclusion options is also a mark of a reliable operator who understands gambling risks and is willing to help you manage them. How do I self-exclude from online gambling? You can self-exclude from online gambling through an online betting website or app with self-exclusion options. Most operators opt into a regional or national exclusion scheme like Gamstop and offer self-exclusion as part of their responsible gambling package. When you self-exclude through one platform, you effectively self-exclude from all platforms registered with the scheme. You can self-exclude from online gambling temporarily or permanently, from as little as 24 hours to several months or longer. Can I access an online casino after self-excluding? Not until your exclusion period expires. When you apply for self-exclusion, the website verifies your identity and records your data, including your account details, address, and name. Once you’re locked out of your account, you cannot use these details to log back in or create a new account before the end of the exclusion period. You may also be barred from receiving gambling-related ads. Can I exclude from multiple online casinos at once? Yes. Some regions and countries have multi-operator self-exclusion schemes that allow you to self-exclude from all registered operators at once. When you self-exclude in such a region, you enter a centralized list that all operators on the scheme use to limit access to gambling services. Is self-exclusion foolproof? No. In addition to being only one part of the solution, self-exclusion is difficult to implement in the digital era. It relies primarily on your ability to recognize that you have a gambling problem and your willingness to seek help. Not all bettors have that. Even after you’ve self-excluded, you can access gambling services if you want to. Some bettors use VPNs or create accounts on non-scheme platforms. Responsible gambling in 2025 Online gambling platforms have gotten a lot better at preventing self-excluded bettors from accessing gambling services. Operators like Betway track cookies, account creation patterns, player profiles, and IP addresses to enforce and maintain self-exclusion statuses. In 2025, as regulators refocus on responsible gaming, these efforts should receive more regional, national, and international support from regulatory frameworks and policies.

Despite its commitment to decentralization, it operates as a centralized entity, with a director, a treasury, paid developers, and an inner circle. These structures, while necessary for coordination, create tensions with Ethereum's decentralized ethos. The Foundation Today It is not widely known, but the current foundation was constructed in a less than ideal way. The previous director, Ming, was ousted in a coordinated effort by a group of people who have never been publicly identified or held accountable for it. I spoke with Ming days before her removal and she assured me she had no intent of leaving. I was later given information about who was responsible for her removal, but was not given much insight as to why. I have heard that Ming was a bit of a micromanager, and that she had an intensity that rubbed some people the wrong way. I’m sure there’s truth to that, but these stories are often window dressing for deeper truths. I can infer some good-faith reasons based on the way the org has been run over the past seven years. A very important role of the organization is to protect against internal power struggles as well as external capture. These are noble goals and ones they seem to have accomplished effectively. Another major focus seems to have been minimizing the public footprint of the organization and constructing it in such a way that it would not draw the ire of governments who might hold them accountable if the political winds shifted against them. But as political winds shift, and the marketplace provides alternatives, the organization itself must adapt, both in form and function.Ethereum was in its birth a visionary project, not simply technological in nature. It pointed towards a possibility of previously unimaginable futures through the empowerment of the individual to do what had previously taken billions of dollars, thousands of people, or millions of man hours to accomplish. The Ethereum Foundation, in its current incarnation, designed to minimize threats both internal and external, has lost that vision. Lead with Vision Ethereum’s next phase demands more than just technical research and coordinating conferences. It requires visionary leadership — someone who understands not just the technology but its broader social, philosophical, and political implications. This leader must inspire a new generation of builders, connect technology with human needs, and navigate the complexities of the political landscape without compromising Ethereum’s ethos.Read more: Sam Kessler - Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin Goes On Offense Amid Major Leadership Shake-up The Ethereum whitepaper was not just a technical document; it was a beacon that allowed like-minded people to come together under a shared vision. In the face of chaos, uncertainty, and frequent conflicts, it served as a guiding light. What ensured our collective success was not the absence of challenges but the clarity of the mountaintop we were striving toward. This common vision allowed us to stay aligned even when disagreements and setbacks arose. It was an idea whose time had come—a blueprint that transcended the individuals behind it and inspired a community to persevere, innovate, and ultimately bring that vision to life. Without it, the project could have easily unraveled under the weight of its ambition. Be Transparent, Focus More on the Community Transparency is equally critical. Over the past few years, the Foundation has retreated into the shadows, leaving the community feeling disconnected. But ethereum would have been nothing without its community, and it will be nothing if it loses it. A community must be managed, curated, and cared for. It requires the onboarding of new people, with new energy, and new ideas, bound by a common vision. This also includes the teams who build on ethereum. Seize the Moment From a legal perspective, Ethereum must embrace the opportunity to engage with lawmakers. The current American political climate is uniquely favorable, and inaction now risks losing momentum. America has elected a President who not only owns ether, but has himself launched a lending protocol on top of it. As of now, we are inhabiting a political landscape which was unthinkable even a year ago, when Democrats surprised so many of us by openly declaring war on crypto, and the future seemed uncertain. There has never been a better time than now to ensure that the promise of crypto is realized. While maintaining political neutrality, the Foundation can create or promote frameworks that encourage compliance and innovation. Without these frameworks, the crypto space has been plagued by speculative ventures—ICOs, DAOs, NFTs—that skirt regulations rather than working within them to build sustainable use cases. Lead by Example The Ethereum Foundation should also consider utilizing its own technology to coordinate its operations and demonstrate the transformative potential of decentralized systems. By adopting Ethereum-based tools and protocols, the Foundation could potentially manage governance, treasury disbursements, decision-making processes, and community engagement. This approach would not only demonstrate Ethereum’s capabilities but also reinforce trust within the community by embodying the principles of decentralization and transparency that the project champions. Additionally, leveraging Ethereum’s ecosystem for coordination could serve as a real-world case study, inspiring developers and organizations to explore similar solutions. By integrating its technology into its own operations, the Foundation would highlight the real-world utility of the platform while setting a precedent for how decentralized systems can effectively manage complex organizations. Be Accountable, Build the Future Finally, financial accountability must become a priority. With $100 million spent annually, the Foundation should deliver measurable outcomes. Despite significant investment in technical research, user experience in crypto remains stagnant. Improving UX, UI, key management, and other security and usability problems isn’t insurmountable but has been severely neglected. This oversight reflects a blind spot which must be addressed before wider adoption is possible. Ethereum began as more than just a technological project—it was a visionary movement for empowering individuals to achieve what once required massive resources. That vision is at risk of being lost. To reignite it, the Foundation must embrace transparency, invest in leadership, engage the community, and step into the legal and political spotlight. Ethereum’s story is one of triumph over chaos, and a testament to the power of collective vision. To ensure its future, the Ethereum Foundation must transform itself from a reactive institution into a proactive visionary force. For ethereum. For the community. For the greater good. For the future.

39279780,https://timestabloid.com/?p=55199,1737511176,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,What Is CPA in Casino Affiliate Programs?,https://timestabloid.com/what-is-cpa-in-casino-affiliate-programs/,"Everyone interested in the iGaming industry can diversify their revenue sources by joining result-yielding casino affiliate programs. The cost-per-acquisition (CPA) model facilitates earning commissions whenever a person performs a specific action, such as making a deposit. In this guide, we will explore the importance of CPA and demonstrate the benefits of becoming an affiliated partner of reliable providers like P4P Partners. What Is CPA in Affiliate Marketing? CPA refers to the commission model that enables affiliates to earn a fee for motivating players to join iGaming platforms and perform specific actions. In the online gambling industry, CPA casino affiliate programs have gained prominence due to their effectiveness in driving high-quality traffic. Understanding the commission structure associated with this type of marketing is crucial for improving the quality of promotional efforts. Affiliates typically earn a fixed amount for every player who joins a platform or app. Maximizing earnings rests upon their ability to bring high-paying customers. The size of the commissions depends on the company they cooperate with and the deposit amount. Why Choose the CPA Model in Casino Marketing? Affiliates prefer to utilize the CPA model due to its transparent payout terms. By adjusting their promotional strategies, they can find a way to increase their payouts. Driving new traffic and motivating players to maintain regular activity on a platform enables affiliates to boost their revenues. Let’s consider the key upsides to joining gambling affiliate programs: Growing earnings; An easy-to-understand multi-payment system; Clear criteria for becoming an affiliate; Predictable income; Immediate payouts; Reduced risk. The CPA model is perfectly suitable for affiliates interested in quick earnings. This approach allows them to earn 100-500 EUR per every registration and subsequent deposit. However, choosing a reliable company is necessary to earn high commissions and promote top-quality products. CPA vs. RevShare Casino Affiliate Marketing Programs Even though the CPA commission model deservedly remains popular, some people still opt for the RevShare (Revenue Share) model, as the latter allows them to earn a percentage of revenue generated by site visitors. While one-time commissions for bringing one client seem high, top-quality leads may help marketers maximize their returns if they choose the RevShare model. Before making the final decision, it’s worth comparing casino CPA and RevShare programs to select the best option. While the former enables marketers to enjoy consistent earnings, the latter may be less profitable, as commissions often change due to player preferences. CPA programs are preferred by those who prioritize bringing in new customers and do not want to depend on the level of player engagement. Choosing between CPA and RevShare models requires affiliates to analyze their favorite marketing approaches, financial goals, and willingness to deal with volatility. How to Join a CPA Casino Affiliate Program? Marketers should opt for trusted iGaming affiliate networks with many satisfied clients when looking for new income sources. Such businesses establish partnerships with well-known brands that release trendy games with enticing bonuses and incentives. Providers like P4P Partners are renowned in the industry for their spotless reputation. They offer a choice of opportunities to earn money. Follow these steps to become an affiliate: Sign up with a chosen service provider; Fill out an online form; Share links with your followers via social media and websites. With affiliate earnings reaching 250,000 EUR per month, the CPA model becomes more popular. Trusted services offer up to 50% of each first deposit to those who bring in paying customers. Becoming an affiliate is a life-changing decision that allows marketers to stabilize their financial situation and master new user acquisition skills. Famous brands like P4P Partners offer multiple payout options and have flexible conditions catering to the needs of their affiliates.

More on Chainlink Price Prediction & Injective Upgrade,https://thecoinrise.com/web3bay-leads-the-pack-as-2025s-high-roi-altcoin-more-on-chainlink-price-prediction-injective-upgrade/,"2025 might be pivotal for high-return altcoins. With Chainlink’s upbeat price forecast backed by its new Cross-Chain Token standard boosting interoperability, it’s primed for wider use. Injective’s update enhances its service by incorporating tokenized AI resources, broadening ETP options, and underlining its innovation and user reach. Both projects are gaining traction by merging advanced technology with practical uses. Enter Web3Bay, a revolutionary in decentralized e-commerce. More than a marketplace, it allows token holders to earn passively and tap into the thriving Web3 domain. Offering future staking rewards, unique loyalty benefits, and seamless Web3 integration, Web3Bay represents a significant growth avenue in blockchain commerce, an appealing choice for those eyeing expansion. Web3Bay: Pioneering Decentralized Marketplaces for Enhanced Earnings Web3Bay is changing the e-commerce landscape by launching a blockchain-based decentralized marketplace. It not only supports transactions but also gives token holders chances to earn passively and engage with the Web3 environment. An upcoming feature is staking rewards that encourage further earnings and motivate long-term token holding. Web3Bay’s current presale is in stage four, with the 3BAY token priced at $0.004562. Following a tiered price increase of 15% per stage, it’s expected to hit $0.1959 by the final phase. With over $830,000 collected, early buyers can reap a potential ROI of up to 6,430% from the initial price of $0.003. The platform also provides exclusive marketplace discounts and benefits to token holders. Additionally, Web3Bay plans to expand into NFTs and DeFi, maintaining its relevance in the expanding Web3 domain. This mix of innovative offerings and a strong presale model positions Web3Bay as a top choice for immediate and long-term blockchain market value. Chainlink Price Prediction: Anticipating Significant Growth Chainlink’s latest updates, especially the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) v1.5, are enhancing its functionality. This upgrade introduces a Cross-Chain Token (CCT) standard, simplifying the creation and management of tokens across various blockchains. This adoption is driving a positive outlook for Chainlink, with price expectations reaching up to $29 and possibly $40 if the bullish trend persists. Supporting this growth are substantial investments from institutions, with over $31 million in LINK tokens purchased since mid-January 2025, indicating strong confidence in its capabilities and future. This institutional and technical support reinforces Chainlink’s strong market position, offering promising opportunities in blockchain solutions with practical applications. Injective Upgrade: Expanding Capabilities and Accessibility The recent Injective upgrade emphasizes its commitment to broadening functionality and accessibility. Through a partnership with Aethir, Injective has incorporated tokenized GPU compute resources, enabling AI agents to work smoothly across blockchains like Solana. This development places Injective at the core of blockchain and AI integration—a sector with substantial growth prospects. Further establishing its market presence, Injective has launched new ETPs (Exchange-Traded Products) with 21Shares and Valour Funds. These products simplify access to INJ tokens and offer staking rewards, boosting holder engagement and utility. This upgrade and these new offerings underline Injective’s focus on user-centric growth and technological advancement. Key Takeaway! The advancements at Chainlink, especially the new Cross-Chain Token standard, alongside the upbeat Chainlink price forecast, hint at a strong year for LINK. Similarly, Injective’s latest update with tokenized AI resources and new ETP launches highlights its dedication to innovation and user-focused growth. Amid these updates, Web3Bay emerges as a standout in blockchain commerce. With its combination of staking rewards, loyalty benefits, and Web3 integrations, it merges e-commerce utility with real-world token benefits. For those seeking durable value in blockchain ventures, Web3Bay offers a chance to join a progressive ecosystem that melds earning potential with groundbreaking features. These initiatives underscore how blockchain continues to evolve decentralized solutions for a dynamically expanding digital economy.

39278450,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=680038,1737511218,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/39278450.jpeg,"Ethereum Appears ‘Bottomed Out,’ Analyst Predicts A Rally Is Near",https://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/ethereum-appears-bottomed-out-analyst-predicts-a-rally-is-near/,"Ethereum (ETH) appears to have ‘bottomed out,’ according to crypto analyst Mister Crypto. The analyst shared this observation as investor confidence in ETH continues to wane due to the digital asset’s relatively lackluster price performance in 2024. Is Ethereum Due For A Rally? Unlike Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL), which have surged in the past year by 146% and 154%, respectively, Ethereum has risen a modest 32% over the same period. As a result, ETH holders are understandably frustrated with the digital asset’s price action, with some whales liquidating their holdings at losses of up to $1 million. Related Reading: Will Ethereum Bounce Back? Crypto Analysts Discuss Potential Price Recovery However, some analysts now believe it may finally be time for Ethereum to break out of its stagnation. Crypto trader Mister Crypto shared the following ETH/BTC monthly chart on X, showing ETH’s price bouncing off a long-standing trendline before entering a parabolic run. This analysis aligns with a recent report highlighting ETH’s four-year low of 0.031 against BTC on the weekly chart. A potential rebound from this multi-year support level could position ETH to outperform BTC in the short term. Crypto analyst Merlijn The Trader also identified a bullish falling wedge pattern forming on Ethereum’s 2-day chart. According to Merlijn, a breakout to the upside could make Ethereum’s next move “legendary.” For the uninitiated, a bullish falling wedge is a technical chart pattern that forms when an asset’s price consolidates between two downward-sloping, converging trendlines. It typically signals a potential trend reversal or continuation, with a breakout to the upside expected once the price moves above the upper trendline. In Ethereum’s case, its price must decisively break through the $3,400 level to confirm the bullish falling wedge pattern. Failure to do so could result in ETH falling to the next major support levels at $3,000 and potentially $2,400. Finally, seasoned crypto market commentator Poseidon offered a more macro perspective on ETH’s price action. The analyst noted that Ethereum has been trading within a range for the past four years. A breakout above the critical $4,000 resistance level could propel ETH beyond $10,000, based on Fibonacci price extensions. 2025: The Year Of Altseason? A full-blown altseason typically requires ETH to lead the market. Thus, a strong 2025 for Ethereum could significantly increase the likelihood of the eagerly anticipated altseason. Fortunately, many investors are optimistic about ETH’s prospects this year. Related Reading: Ethereum Poised For A Bullish Q1 2025? Here’s What Experts Say In December 2024, analysts at brokerage firm Bernstein remarked that ETH’s risk-reward ratio has become increasingly attractive. Similarly, Steno Research predicted that ETH could outperform BTC in Q1 2025, with a price target as high as $8,000. However, the $4,000 resistance level remains ETH’s Achilles’ heel. At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $3,280, down 2.1% in the past 24 hours.

Their latest analysis shows that the Dogecoin price would drop by 59% in the coming weeks. On the other hand, they have identified WallitIQ, an AI altcoin, as the potential “Shiba Inu (SHIB) of this cycle,” having shown a similar historical pattern. The crypto community’s reaction to this prediction has raised an important question for investors: Why are memecoin whales jumping ship to WallitIQ (WLTQ) ? WallitIQ (WLTQ) Shows Promising Signs As The Next 50,000% Crypto Success Story According to Bloomberg Analysts, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has dubbed itself as the Shiba Inu (SHIB) of this cycle. The AI altcoin has flashed numerous bullish signals for a 50,000% surge by June. This once-in-a-lifetime opportunity has stirred short-term and long-term investors who want to become millionaires to join the lucrative platform. Further analysis shows that only early adopters will enjoy maximum rewards. There are several reasons WallitIQ (WLTQ) is the talk of the crypto community. From creating a highly-rewarding ecosystem to the launch of the MVP build of its Crypto Wallet Management Mobile App , WallitIQ (WLTQ) has outperformed other presale companions and established crypto projects. The affordable $0.0420 AI altcoin will spike to $21 before June. As such, whales and seasoned crypto enthusiasts are pitching their tents to secure their position before the price changes. Hence, Bloomberg analysts think WallitIQ (WLTQ) will surpass a $20 million inflow before June. The AI altcoin provides unrestricted access to sophisticated technology and numerous trading opportunities. Its all-in-one app displays transaction histories, observes real-time prices via the CoinGecko API, and manages their wallets. Its AI-powered trading automation is underway for investors who want to gain insights into exclusive data like Bloomberg analysts. Another outstanding feature of the AI altcoin is its access to over 1,000 cryptocurrencies. Beginners can employ the artificial intelligence (AI) protocol to determine a worthy investment, while long-term investors can multiply their rewards by a possible 180% APY when they stake their tokens. As the hype about the Dogecoin price plummets, WallitIQ (WLTQ) shows more promising signs as the next 50,000% crypto success story. Investors do not need to worry about the safety of their assets as WallitIQ (WLTQ) has fulfilled a smart contract audit from SolidProof. Hence, no one wants to miss the golden chance to get in and enjoy substantial profits. With only $0.0420, you can create the path to generational wealth. Several early adopters have become millionaires. With bigger rewards on the horizon, now is the right time to lock in. Buy WLTQ tokens today. Dogecoin Price Prediction: DOGE Whales Seek Another After A Possible 59% Drop The Dogecoin price has struggled in 2025 despite a strong end to 2024. In the past day, the Dogecoin price has dropped by 4.92%. As of this writing, the Dogecoin price trades below $0.4. However, Bloomberg analysts have identified this level as the beginning of a 59% drop while highlighting an AI altcoin, WallitIQ (WLTQ), as a worthy investment. The crypto community has reacted to this prediction as more whale networks have abandoned Dogecoin (DOGE) for WallitIQ (WLTQ). Can Shiba Inu (SHIB) Repeat History? Shiba Inu (SHIB) experienced a great run in October 2021. Within 2 weeks, Shiba Inu (SHIB) grew by 1163%. Bloomberg analysts said WallitIQ (WLTQ) showed a bullish pattern similar to that of Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) historical pattern. The rise of Shiba Inu (SHIB) was fostered by strong media hyper and community engagement. However, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has shown better potential.. Conclusion While the Dogecoin price faces a predicted 59% decline, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has emerged as a potential “Shiba Inu (SHIB) of this cycle.” Bloomberg analysts have spelled out the contrasting fortunes of Dogecoin (DOGE) and WallitIQ (WLTQ). This shows that the market dynamics have shifted from meme-coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), to this AI altcoin, which has cemented its position as the best presale event in crypto history. The movement of DOGE whales towards the AI altcoin shows a strategic positioning for massive growth potential. The ever-changing crypto landscape has a new star in WallitIQ (WLTQ) and its incoming uptrends. Buy the WLTQ tokens today to ride the next bull wave in the coming weeks.

Concurrently, Aave is seeing a notable increase in value following its V4 upgrade and strategic rebranding, drawing substantial interest from the DeFi community. Amidst this, BlockDAG (BDAG) is emerging as a pivotal player. With plans to list on 10 major CEXs, it is poised to make significant strides in market visibility, liquidity, and global reach. The momentum building around BDAG is palpable, raising the question of not if, but when to engage with BlockDAG as it prepares to redefine the norms of blockchain scalability. BlockDAG: On the Verge of a Major Breakthrough—Are You Positioned? BlockDAG is at a critical juncture, ready to launch on 10 key centralized exchanges (CEXs) in what is one of the most eagerly awaited events in the crypto sphere this year. This move is anticipated to significantly enhance BDAG’s market presence and adoption. For those looking ahead, now presents a strategic opportunity to get involved before BlockDAG escalates to a global scale and reaches its full potential. Having already raised $182.5 million in its presale, with 17.9 billion BDAG coins distributed, BlockDAG is capturing intense market interest. At a current presale price of $0.0248 per BDAG, early adopters are looking at a 2380% ROI, reaffirming BlockDAG’s position as one of the top bullish cryptos to buy now. With its sophisticated Phantom and GhostDAG protocols, BlockDAG offers unmatched scalability and throughput, setting it apart in the Web3 landscape. Its recent partnership with HackerEarth, which aims to engage over 15,000 developers to kickstart more than 200 projects, is likely to fortify its ecosystem further. As the presale period draws to a close and the CEX launch approaches, BlockDAG is distinguishing itself as a formidable contender in the 2025 crypto market. Virtuals Protocol: Pioneering the Next Generation of AI Agents Virtuals Protocol is elevating AI agents by enabling their tokenized ownership and monetization across various digital landscapes. In January 2025, its token reached a new peak of $4, fueled by robust adoption and demand, and it currently trades at $3.62, maintaining strong market presence. Now housing over 2,200 AI agents, with top valuations surpassing $300 million, Virtuals has bolstered its platform security, enhancing user confidence. With ambitious plans for expansion and new AI-driven tools in development, Virtuals Protocol is positioning itself as an innovative leader in blockchain technology applications, promising a bright future in the upcoming year. Aave’s Price Surge: Unpacking the DeFi Enthusiasm Aave remains a focal point in the decentralized finance arena with its latest V4 protocol enhancement, incorporating features like an emergency redemption mechanism for its GHO stablecoin to mitigate depegging risks. This initiative underscores Aave’s commitment to addressing key DeFi sector challenges. With these enhancements set for completion by mid-2025, there’s already a noticeable impact on Aave’s valuation. Furthermore, Aave’s transition to Avara and the acquisition of the crypto wallet Family have broadened its Web3 footprint. These strategic moves are not only expanding its user base but are also contributing to a surge in Aave’s market price. As Aave continues to refine its operations on platforms like Polygon, it is adopting a proactive stance in ensuring secure and scalable growth through 2025. Summing Up! Aave is reinforcing its stronghold in DeFi through its innovative V4 upgrade and strategic transition to Avara, which is mirrored in the appreciating Aave price. Likewise, Virtuals Protocol’s significant role in the decentralized application sphere, especially with its AI agents, is becoming increasingly central, highlighted by its token’s current performance. As these initiatives gain momentum, BlockDAG is poised for a landmark market entry with its upcoming debut on 10 centralized exchanges. This development is set to dramatically elevate BDAG’s liquidity and market demand, affirming its status as one of the best bullish cryptos to buy now . As BlockDAG prepares for this pivotal event, the strategic window for engagement is now.

However, he admitted he didn’t know much about its performance. While speaking to a group of reporters on Tuesday afternoon, Trump was asked about his new meme coin. He said: I don’t know much about it other than I launched it. I heard it was very successful. I haven’t checked. President Donald Trump After the comments, TRUMP fell over 30% to $34.88 but has since recovered and is now trading at $42.07 . Trump’s meme coin surges to $15B before MELANIA’s launch Trump Organization affiliate CIC Digital LLC launched the ‘TRUMP’ meme coin . The firm is linked to previous sales of crypto collectible NFTs launched in 2022 that made millions of dollars but have since fallen dramatically in value for their owners. The Solana-based meme coin was launched three days before Trump took office. The meme coin’s market cap jumped to $15 billion over the weekend, although it currently trades with a market cap around $8 billion. The coin surged from less than $10 on Saturday morning to as high as $74.59 before giving up some of its gains on Monday. One of the reporters at the Tuesday meeting mentioned that the TRUMP token had generated several billion dollars in the past few days. The president appeared shocked and responded, “Several billion?” He then dismissed the gains as insignificant. He pointed out that SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son, OpenAI’s Sam Altman, and Oracle’s Larry Ellison, who were present in the room, were worth much more. The TRUMP token dropped 50% Sunday afternoon following the news that Trump’s wife, First Lady Melania Trump, had also launched her own meme coin. Both tokens are believed to be largely owned by Trump insiders. Thanks to their high profile and social media presence, the TRUMP coin and MELANIA coin have already entered the top 100 coins in terms of value. MELANIA’s coin is now worth more than AI entrepreneur Sam Altman’s Worldcoin. Trump signs executive orders, issues pardons, and plans cryptocurrency policies On his first day in office, Trump signed multiple executive orders on energy, border security, immigration, infrastructure, and more. He pardoned Ross Ulbricht of Silk Road and 1,500 January 6 protesters, including Oath Keepers and Proud Boys. However, he did not address a promised Bitcoin strategic reserve or reverse the prior administration’s policies, which some have dubbed Operation Chokepoint 2.0. Trump is reportedly planning to issue an executive order making cryptocurrency a national policy priority and has appointed David Sacks as his administration’s crypto czar. Several exchanges and brokerages, including Coinbase and Robinhood, have listed the “official” TRUMP meme coin.

Inaugurated Trump (TRUMPINA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 12,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPINA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Inaugurated Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Inaugurated Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Inaugurated Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Inaugurated Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Inaugurated Trump by entering its contract address – 2F9Q7eZwdnfWUY6Pcqvb7KFDXVW2vcoLCDoTkzsHUvTF – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPINA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|DOGE|SOL|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-22 02:12:09

For investors, 2025 is shaping up to be no different, with both emerging projects and established giants vying for attention. The key is figuring out which coins can deliver exponential returns and which might fall short. Qubetics is one of the rising stars of 2025, turning heads with its innovative approach as the world’s first Web3 aggregator. If you’re hunting for the best cryptos for exponential returns, Qubetics has all the markings of a market leader. Not to be outdone, Tron and Render are also making headlines. Both projects have secured their places in the crypto ecosystem, serving as reliable investments for different kinds of investors. Let’s explore what makes these three cryptos the top picks for January 2025. Qubetics: The Best Cryptos for Exponential Returns Qubetics is redefining the crypto space with its role as a Web3 aggregator . It’s a unifying platform that connects decentralized apps, users, and data across multiple blockchains. By solving one of blockchain’s biggest challenges—Qubetics has positioned itself as a game-changer for businesses, developers, and everyday users. One of Qubetics’ standout features is its ability to simplify cross-border transactions . Imagine you’re a small business owner in South America wanting to pay a supplier in Europe. Traditionally, you’d face long delays, high fees, and complex banking systems. With Qubetics, those payments happen almost instantly and at a fraction of the cost. Freelancers can also use Qubetics to manage contracts and payments globally without worrying about currency conversions or hidden fees. For developers, Qubetics’ seamless integrations mean they can build dApps that function effortlessly across Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon without worrying about compatibility issues.

With a token price of $0.0551, the project’s raised over $10.1 million, cementing its status as a must-watch crypto. The numbers tell the story. Analysts predict $TICS will hit $0.25 by the end of the best crypto presale , a 353.39% increase. Long-term projections include $1, $5, and even $15 after the mainnet launch, marking potential returns as high as 27,103.64%. For anyone looking for the best cryptos for exponential returns, Qubetics is a no-brainer. Tron: A DeFi Powerhouse Tron has built its reputation as a decentralized platform for content sharing and smart contracts. With its lightning-fast transactions and low fees, Tron has carved out a niche in the DeFi and gaming industries. Its native token, TRX, is a staple among crypto enthusiasts seeking both utility and investment potential. As of January 21, 2025, Tron’s price stands at $0.23988, with a slight dip of 0.00053% from the previous close. Beyond the numbers, Tron’s strategic partnership with Wintermute has been a game-changer.

Adding to the intrigue, reports suggest that former U.S. President Donald Trump invested $4.7 million in TRX on his first day in office. While unconfirmed, such news adds a layer of excitement and speculation to Tron’s market dynamics. Tron’s ability to deliver scalable, low-cost solutions makes it a favorite for developers and investors alike.

This approach has drastically reduced costs and increased accessibility for industries like gaming, animation, and virtual reality. R ender’s price as of January 21, 2025, is $6.64, reflecting a 7.65% dip from the previous close. Despite the short-term decline, Render continues to innovate.

The announcement came through Trump’s social media platform, Truth Social, where he stated it was his “pleasure” to grant clemency to Ulbricht, who had been serving a life sentence since 2015. Ulbricht, 40, was convicted for his role in creating and running Silk Road, a dark web marketplace used for the sale of illegal drugs and other items. The pardon fulfills a promise Trump made during his presidential campaign, which gained widespread attention among libertarian activists and criminal justice reform advocates. Donald Trump Justifies Ross Ulbricht Clemency Decision President Donald Trump has stated his displeasure with the legal process that resulted in Ulbricht receiving a life sentence. In a post on the Truth Social platform, he called the sentence “ridiculous” and lambasted the actors in the case as “the same freaks” who, he alleged, conspired against him during his time in the White House. Trump said he had talked to Ulbricht’s mother during his first full day back in the White House and informed her that he would be pardoning her son. ”Ross has done enough time in jail for non-violent crimes,” said Trump. Amid this pardon, bullish momentum has resurfaced with TRUMP memecoin recovering and price soaring to $42.03, a 20% surge from the intra-day low of $32. The pardon has elicited cheers and jeers as Ulbricht’s case has been a subject of division for quite some time. Some of the people defending him say that the punishment he received was severe while others claim that the platform was used to coordinate large-scale drug distribution. However, despite the pardon, Ross Ulbricht (ROSS) token price dipped over 51% to trade at $0.01091, as of press time. Libertarian Support and Calls for Clemency The Libertarian Party has been advocating for getting leniency for Ulbricht. Chair of the Libertarian National Committee Angela McArdle said he is a “political prisoner” and praised the decision to pardon as a victory for their cause. “Ross Ulbricht has been a libertarian political prisoner for over ten years,” McArdle said in a statement. She also thanked Donald Trump for taking action, saying it was ‘a long-overdue step toward justice.’ Senator Rand Paul, who had encouraged Trump to intervene, also voiced support for a clemency for Ulbricht. Paul said that Ulbricht received a harsh sentence than the drug dealers who used the Silk Road. He pointed to several cases of car dealers getting from five to ten years behind the bars, while Ulbricht was given two life terms without a chance for parole. Ulbricht’s Time in Prison and Path to Clemency Ulbricht has spent more than 11 years in federal prison and has not violated any prison rules while serving time. According to media, he has not only spent his time in prison teaching math and science but also practicing yoga. His defense and friends have also called attention to the inconsistencies in the case such as charges for murder for hire that were dropped. His clemency lawyer Brandon Sample thanked Trump for fulfilling the promise made during his campaign saying that the decision has bought ‘relief and hope’ to Ulbricht’s family. Ulbricht’s case had not remained confined to the libertarian community only. Supporters of criminal justice reform said his punishment exemplifies what they believe is excessive punishment for non-violent crimes. Broader Context of Donald Trump’s Pardons The pardon for Ulbricht is within a list of many executive orders that Donald Trump has signed since he began his second term in office. On Monday, Trump commuted the sentences of approximately 1,500 people who have been charged in relation to the January 6 Capitol attack sparking controversies. The pardon also had support from Tesla CEO Elon Musk , a supporter of the Trump administration. He announced the decision on social media where he said, “Ross will be freed too.” Ulbricht, who founded Silk Road under the alias of Dread Pirate Roberts, was arrested in 2013 and found guilty in 2015. He was the first to offer his platform as a marketplace for purchasing goods and services using Bitcoin on the dark web.

The tweet reads, “About 98% of the people will sell their #XRP after $10-$50. I am here to see the price above $100. Who will stay with me?” The statement resonated with community members, who shared their perspectives on holding strategies and price targets. The responses highlight a significant divide in the community, ranging from conservative profit-taking approaches to ambitious long-term holding plans. Community Perspectives on Price Targets One user, Magixchirps, shared an especially bold outlook stating , “I’m here to see it past $1000 and still wouldn’t sell at that price. I have 15 years left before I reach the retirement age of a reg hard working man. So I will let it sit until I reach that number.” This comment underscores a belief in XRP’s potential to reach unprecedented price levels and a long-term investment mindset tied to personal financial goals. Magixchirps reflects a segment of investors who see XRP as a cornerstone of their retirement strategy, regardless of shorter-term price fluctuations. Another user, SunsetButterfly, offered a slightly more conservative but still optimistic perspective, she said “Above a $100 yes, but if you sell all of it, I think that is foolish. I think it’s an investment for the long term and will go way, way up.” Sunsetbutterfly’s response highlights a cautious yet forward-looking approach, advocating for partial profit-taking while retaining a substantial portion of XRP holdings for long-term growth. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 User Jiggy echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the importance of diversifying holding strategies: “Holding for the long haul. Will sell some along the way but not until we reach 3 digits. I will leave a big bag to hold for a long long long time that my kids can enjoy.” Jiggy’s viewpoint reflects a generational wealth-building philosophy, suggesting that XRP may be a valuable legacy asset for future generations. Implications for the XRP Community The variety of opinions shared in response to XRP Avengers’ tweet highlights an important debate within the XRP community . While some investors aim for more modest targets, planning to sell between $10 and $50, others are committed to holding out for triple or even quadruple-digit price levels. These divergent strategies demonstrate the wide spectrum of investor confidence and financial planning among XRP holders. As the digital asset market evolves, it remains uncertain whether XRP will achieve the ambitious price levels envisioned by its most optimistic supporters. However, the discussion underscores a broader principle in crypto investing: each individual must define their goals, risk tolerance, and timeline.

First, expectations surrounding the resignation of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, effective January 2025, have fostered optimism for a more supportive regulatory landscape for crypto. Additionally, there is increasing speculation about the potential approval of a spot XRP Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF), which could make it easier for institutional investors to participate in the market. Lastly, the overall positive sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, largely influenced by Bitcoin’s rise, has contributed to the momentum of altcoins like XRP. Together, these factors have solidified XRP’s position as a leading cryptocurrency with strong growth potential.

This notable indicator known as the Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (STH SOPR) which reveals the behavior of Short-Term Holders (STHs) has shown that STHs have started to sell at a loss. This metric compares 30-day STH SOPR to its 365-day counterpart and provides insight into whether short-term investors are realizing profits or losses. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin’s Upward Cycle Back? Key Insights Into The Latest Recovery Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Realized Losses To grasp what the Short-Term Holder’s current selling at a loss means for the market, it’s important to first understand its broader market implications. Darkfost, the CryptoQuant analyst behind the revelation of this data reveals that when STH SOPR turns negative, two scenarios often unfold “holding” and “capitulation” The analyst mentioned that some STHs may hold their BTC, using their realized price as a potential support level, while others could capitulate, triggering further corrections. Historically, these periods of STH losses have marked attractive entry points for long-term investors.

In Darkfost words: Historically, when this metric turns negative, it often highlights attractive entry points for the long term. However, it’s essential to confirm such signals by cross-referencing with other metrics and assessing the broader market sentiment. MVRV Ratio Highlights Potential Market Trends Besides the STH realized losses suggesting potential attractive entry points for long-term investors, Bitcoin’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio has also indicated an interesting trend incoming for Bitcoin. Another CryptoQuant analyst known as Tugbachain recently shared in a post on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform that currently, the MVRV ratio stands at 2.4, and it is approaching a key support level. If it breaks below this support and then reverses its downtrend, it could climb back into the 4-6 range historically associated with Bitcoin peaks, the analyst reveals. For context, the MVRV ratio is an indicator that measures whether a cryptocurrency is overvalued or undervalued by comparing its market capitalization to the value at which it was last moved.

According to Tugbachain, over multiple halving cycles, the MVRV ratio has proven to be a reliable tool for identifying market tops and bottoms, as well as shorter-term fluctuations adding credibility to the latest indication.

Pro-XRP Lawyer John Deaton Weighs In,https://coinpedia.org/news/is-trumps-meme-coin-a-threat-to-cryptos-future-pro-xrp-lawyer-john-deaton-weighs-in/,"The post Is Trump’s Meme Coin a Threat to Crypto’s Future? Pro-XRP Lawyer John Deaton Weighs In appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Attorney John Deaton recently shared his thoughts on the launch of the Trump meme coin. The crypto community is split and some people believe Trump’s meme coin will attract new investors and help crypto gain more acceptance. Others, like Deaton, are worried that it could harm the industry’s credibility. For Deaton, the issue isn’t the meme coins themselves but the broader implications they have for the crypto industry’s reputation. On the Good Morning Crypto Show, he warned that while meme coins can attract attention and investors, they may also contribute to the public perception of crypto as a “casino” or speculative market, rather than a legitimate technology with real-world utility. Deaton’s concern is that if meme coins dominate the conversation, it could overshadow the more serious and transformative potential of blockchain technology. “I think we’ve been fighting for crypto survival for the past five years, but now we have to fight for legitimacy,” he said. Deaton fears that if the industry doesn’t push for real utility and focus on solving world problems, it may become mired in hype and speculation. Looking Ahead “We must not just survive, but serve,” he said, stressing the importance of pushing for blockchain technology that can truly solve global problems. If meme coins like Trump continue to dominate, the public perception of crypto could shift towards viewing it as a speculative gamble. He believes that the new leadership could allow for a more balanced approach to crypto regulation, one that doesn’t unfairly target legitimate projects like Ripple, Coinbase, and others. “We witnessed a war against crypto. But I have a concern and my concern is that in this country sometimes we have this tendency to go from one extreme to the other extreme. So we’ve had this completely unfair war against crypto and that doesn’t mean we want complete freedom for all where there are no rules, no regulations,” Deaton said.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,TECHNOLOGY|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-22 03:06:24

Among the emerging stars in this space, meme coins have carved out a unique identity, blending humour and community spirit to attract investors. Initially laughed off as mere jokes, these coins have proven their worth, demonstrating that they can provide real financial opportunities. As the market expands, meme coins are increasingly recognised as vital components of the economic landscape. Over the years, the popularity of meme coins has surged, thanks to their viral nature and community-driven ethos. Coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have paved the way, sparking interest from casual investors and crypto enthusiasts alike. Now, BTFD Coin is stepping into the limelight, poised to elevate meme coin popularity to unprecedented heights. With its play-to-earn (P2E) game , enticing referral programme, and rewarding staking options, BTFD Coin is all about harnessing community power to create value for its holders. In this article, we’ll dive into the world of BTFD Coin, Mog Coin, and Neiro, exploring each project in detail. These coins are among the best new meme coins with 100x potential, each bringing unique features and opportunities to the table. But which one should you put your money on? Let’s explore! BTFD Coin: A Presale Wonder BTFD Coin is making headlines for all the right reasons. It’s been a hot topic in the crypto community, especially with its presale performance, which has already surpassed a staggering $5.4 million in just the first month. Currently priced at $0.00016, BTFD Coin has ignited excitement among investors. But hold onto your hats, because there’s more! The presale is skipping straight to Stage 15, meaning all unsold tokens from previous stages will be burnt, drastically reducing supply. This is a big deal! Fewer tokens mean stronger demand, and the buzz around BTFD Coin is palpable. And let’s not forget the incredible bonus offer: use the code LAUNCH100 during the presale to double your tokens! If you’re searching for the best new meme coins with 100x potential, this is an opportunity you can’t afford to miss. How To Claim LAUNCH100 Bonus Code Claiming the LAUNCH100 bonus is a breeze! First, visit the presale page at Buy BTFD Coin . Connect your wallet by clicking “Connect Wallet” and select either MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Next, find the bonus code field, enter LAUNCH100 in ALL CAPS, and hit “Apply.” Confirm the message in your wallet to activate the code. Then, input how much $BTFD you want to purchase, click “Buy Now,” and, Confirm the transaction. It’s that simple! This bonus offers a fantastic chance to significantly increase your holdings. Don’t let this slip through your fingers; the clock is ticking! Mog Coin: In The Green Mog Coin is another contender in the meme coin arena, and it’s been holding its ground quite well. While it might not have the explosive growth of BTFD Coin, Mog Coin is certainly in the green, steadily gaining traction. Its branding is clever, tapping into the meme culture in a way that’s relatable to younger audiences. What sets Mog Coin apart is its focus on community and utility. Unlike some meme coins that thrive solely on hype, Mog Coin offers tangible benefits, including staking rewards and governance features. This approach not only fosters a loyal community but also encourages users to invest long-term. For those looking for stability among the best new meme coins with 100x potential, Mog Coin may just hit the sweet spot. However, while Mog Coin’s performance is commendable, it may not deliver the rapid gains some investors hope for. It’s a solid option for those who appreciate a more gradual growth strategy and want to be part of something meaningful. The community-driven nature of Mog Coin is appealing, especially for those who want to feel connected to their investments. Additionally, as the crypto market continues to evolve, Mog Coin could very well surprise us. If it ramps up its marketing and community engagement, it might just become a sleeper hit among the best new meme coins with 100x potential. Neiro: A Rising Star Let’s turn our attention to Neiro, which is carving out its niche as a rising star in the meme coin market. It’s gaining momentum and positioning itself as one of the best new meme coins with 100x potential. Neiro combines fun and utility, creating an engaging experience for its community. Neiro’s vision goes beyond being just another meme coin. It aims to create an interactive ecosystem where users can participate in various activities, from gaming to social engagement. This multifaceted approach keeps the community invested and engaged, which is crucial for long-term success. The more users interact with the platform, the more they’ll want to hold onto their tokens, driving demand. What’s exciting about Neiro is its growth potential. If it continues to innovate and maintain strong community engagement, it could easily become a favourite among investors. For those looking for something that offers both fun and functionality, Neiro might just be the ticket. It’s all about finding that balance between hype and substance, and Neiro seems to be striking the right chords. As we look to the future, Neiro’s potential seems strong. If it can capitalize on current trends and keep its community engaged, it could become one of the best new meme coins with 100x potential, making it a worthy consideration for investors. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin clearly stands out as the leader among the best new meme coins with 100x potential. Its remarkable presale performance, innovative features, and community-driven ethos make it an appealing choice for anyone looking to invest. With over $5.4 million raised and an enticing bonus offer, the opportunity for significant returns is undeniable. While Mog Coin and Neiro each have their strengths, they currently lag behind the momentum that BTFD Coin has built. Don’t miss out on the chance to join a project that’s poised for greatness.

In a landmark decision that sent waves through the Bitcoin community, President Donald Trump has granted a full and unconditional pardon to Ross Ulbricht, the creator of the Silk Road darknet marketplace. Delivered on January 21, 2025—one day later than his campaign promise—this pardon goes beyond merely commuting Ulbricht’s sentence. It’s a symbolic gesture, perhaps acknowledging the delay with goodwill. For Bitcoiners, this represents more than justice for one man—it’s a signal of potential alignment between the administration and the values Bitcoin embodies. The pardon follows a flurry of executive orders signed on Trump’s first day back in office, underscoring the administration’s focus on a myriad of national priorities. However, this act stands out, particularly for Bitcoiners, as a commitment to keeping promises, sparking hope for pro-Bitcoin legislation and progress on issues like the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Ross Ulbricht’s Silk Road wasn’t just a marketplace—it was Bitcoin’s first major use case. Launched in 2011, when Bitcoin was still in its infancy, the Silk Road demonstrated the revolutionary potential of decentralized, censorship-resistant money. While its operations drew criticism for facilitating illicit trade, it also showcased Bitcoin’s ability to enable peer-to-peer, anonymous transactions. Ulbricht’s double life sentence became a symbol of overreach—a clash between an inflexible system and the frontier spirit of technological innovation. For many in the Bitcoin community, his case represented the broader struggle for autonomy, privacy, and the freedom to innovate. His pardon is now being celebrated as a victory for these principles. The news of Ulbricht’s pardon has energized Bitcoiners, but it also highlights unresolved issues. The Samourai Wallet developers could still face prison time for developing Bitcoin privacy tools. Edward Snowden, another figure celebrated within the Bitcoin community, remains in exile. (Snowden’s revelations about mass surveillance have made him a key voice at Bitcoin conferences, aligning his values with the ethos of financial and personal privacy that Bitcoin embodies.) While Ulbricht’s freedom is a win, the incomplete picture of justice for figures like the Samourai Wallet developers and Snowden reminds us of the broader challenges in protecting digital rights. Ulbricht’s pardon is a significant moment, not just for him but for what it represents: A possible shift in how innovators and pioneers are treated when they challenge existing norms. It also signals that the current administration may be open to reevaluating policies around technology and privacy—issues that deeply resonate with Bitcoiners. The Bitcoin community’s long-standing support for Ulbricht underscores the movement’s commitment to privacy, autonomy, and resistance to overreach. Yet, as celebrations continue, there’s recognition that this is just one step in a larger journey toward protecting those who push the boundaries of innovation. For Bitcoiners, this moment is both a celebration and a rallying cry—a signal to keep pushing for a future where technology empowers individuals and where justice and innovation can coexist.

Ulbricht was serving a life sentence after being convicted for running the platform, which facilitated over $200 million in illegal transactions, including drug sales, using Bitcoin. Trump shared the news on Truth Social, revealing that he personally called Ulbricht’s mother to inform her of the decision. The president said that the pardon was granted in honor of her and the libertarian movement, which had supported him. He also criticized those responsible for Ulbricht’s conviction and said “The scum that worked to convict him were some of the same lunatics who were involved in the modern day weaponization of the government against me.” Background of Ross Ulbricht and Silk Road Ross Ulbricht, born in 1984, created Silk Road, an online marketplace that operated on the dark web. His platform gained worldwide attention for enabling anonymous, unregulated trade in illegal substances, which ultimately led to his arrest in 2013. Ulbricht was convicted in 2015 on multiple charges, including conspiracy to traffic narcotics, money laundering, and computer hacking, receiving two life sentences without the possibility of parole. Silk Road’s existence posed challenges to law enforcement, raising questions about digital privacy, free markets, and the balance between technology and regulation. Despite the illegal activities, Ulbricht’s supporters argue that his life sentence was excessively harsh, especially considering his lack of a prior criminal record. The decision to pardon Ulbricht has sparked mixed reactions, with some praising Trump’s stance on criminal justice reform and others questioning the message it sends regarding accountability for illegal actions. Ulbricht’s case has been a major topic of debate for years, with many in the crypto and libertarian communities advocating for his release.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BTC|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-22 03:26:02

ETH is consolidating above $3,150 and might aim for an upside break. Ethereum failed to gain pace for a close above $3,400 and $3,450. The price is trading above $3,300 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key contracting triangle forming with resistance at $3,355 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears the $3,400 resistance level. Ethereum Price Aims Key Upside Break Ethereum price started a decent upward move from the $3,200 level but upsides were limited compared to Bitcoin . ETH cleared the $3,250 resistance to move into a short-term bullish zone. The bulls were able to push the price above the $3,300 resistance zone. Besides, there was a clear move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,445 swing high to the $3,203 low. However, the bears are still active below $3,400. Ethereum price is now trading above $3,300 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average .

There is also a key contracting triangle forming with resistance at $3,355 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The first major resistance is near the $3,400 level.

An upside break above the $3,550 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,650 resistance zone or even $3,720 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,400 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,300 level. The first major support sits near the $3,250. A clear move below the $3,250 support might push the price toward the $3,200 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,120 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,050. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.

This frenzy has caught the attention of billionaire investor Mark Cuban, who is now contemplating the creation of his own memecoin, inspired by the recent memecoin movements. Cuban’s Memecoin Vision: Combining Fun And Financial Responsibility? In a recent social media post, the renowned billionaire opened the door to the possibility of launching a new memecoin, stating, “If memecoins are the way, maybe I’ll issue one.” His announcement has stirred curiosity among crypto enthusiasts, particularly as he hinted that his memecoin would mirror the parameters of Trump’s TRUMP memecoin. Related Reading: Is It Time To Give Up On Ethereum Below $4,000? Analyst Weighs The Facts Cuban plans to implement a 20% float and adhere to a similar release schedule, with one significant distinction: all potential revenue generated from the sale would be directed to the US Treasury. To enhance transparency, Cuban also indicated that the wallet address would be publicly accessible, allowing anyone to track the funds. Cuban framed his initiative as a way to combine entertainment with a social purpose, noting, “If you want to gamble, gamble. But at least use it to make a dent in the US debt.” This statement reflects a growing sentiment among some investors that memecoins can serve a dual purpose—providing both amusement and potential benefits to broader societal issues. However, Cuban’s proposal has not been without its critics. Cuban Cites Dogecoin Success In response to Cuban’s announcement, a user on X (formerly Twitter) cautioned him about the potential pitfalls of launching a memecoin, suggesting that he might be accused of exploiting information asymmetry at the coin’s launch. The user stressed that the supposed memecoin’s price would be dictated by supply and demand dynamics, starting from nearly zero, and warned Cuban not to proceed without careful consideration. Cuban, undeterred by the criticism, defended his understanding of the memecoin landscape, stating, “It’s not hard to put it together. I never have thought about doing a meme coin. Wouldn’t be hard at all.” Related Reading: Big Players Bet Big On XRP, Solana With Excitement Around Donald Trump’s Presidency, Here Are The Figures The back-and-forth dialogue continued, with the user asserting that creating a sustainable memecoin that benefits long-term holders is a challenging endeavor. He further argued that successful memecoins often emerge from community-driven initiatives rather than top-down launches, warning that hype surrounding a celebrity-backed launch could lead to short-term trading rather than fostering an organic community. Cuban concluded the exchange by acknowledging the importance of community in the longevity of memecoins. He cited examples like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), which have thrived due to their strong communities. “I’m not saying buyers won’t get rekt. I said it was gambling. It’s a game of musical chairs. No promises. No pumps by me. Just complete transparency,” he emphasized. At the time of writing, the TRUMP memecoin is trading at $44,778, recording a 14% recovery in the past 24 hours after plunging over 50% from its $79 peak reached over the weekend.

This famous meme coin has shown formidable power in the past growth, and many are putting their bets on that barking rally which may just propel it to $0.50 or more during the coming months. Even amidst all the fuss surrounding it, however, some other altcoin is secretly preparing for the big take-up with a potential 50x increase at most after the Trump inauguration rally, Rollblock, which is a completely new ramping-up cryptocurrency now getting real both for investors and gamers alike. Why Dogecoin is Poised for a Rally The Dogecoin surge after President Trump’s inauguration is highly anticipated by a number of cryptocurrency folk. After big world events, Dogecoin has a historical propensity for robust price increases, and analysts predict this trend will hold true after Trump’s Inauguration Ceremony. The price changes of the meme coin have frequently been driven by social media phenomena, celebrity promotion, and general recognition. Using a very active community and the support of mainstream celebrities (e.g., Elon Musk), Dogecoin may experience tremendous growth in the short term. As a result of the Musk connection, Dogecoin values have skyrocketed, generating much of the media frenzy. Meaningful applications and high community support that could lead to rapid growth. Rollblock’s Potential in the Cryptocurrency Space As Rollblock continues to garner attention for its Revenue Share model and blockchain transparency, its potential to surpass Dogecoin in growth becomes more apparent. The focus on real-world applications, transparency, and tangible value makes Rollblock a rising star in the cryptocurrency growth potential 50x market. As investors prioritize functional cryptocurrencies over speculative assets, Dogecoin may struggle to keep pace with Rollblock and other emerging high-utility tokens in 2025. In addition to its distinctive approach to decentralized gaming, Rollblock is becoming more well-known for its capacity to address pressing issues in the iGaming sector. As it provides users with real value, Rollblock may surpass Dogecoin by providing features like blockchain transparency. Although Dogecoin has a sizable user base, Rollblock provides something Dogecoin does not: useful applications and robust community support that might spur exponential growth. Rollblock is positioned as an alluring investment possibility in the cryptocurrency growth potential 50x space thanks to its Revenue Share model, which guarantees that token holders directly profit from the platform’s success. Rollblock’s decentralized platform has the potential to upend the market and completely change the way gaming activities are conducted as the iGaming industry becomes more transparent and regulated. At this point, the difference between high-utility tokens like Rollblock and Dogecoin following the Trump inauguration rally widnes.

This performance has further highlighted the disparity between Bitcoin and Ethereum’s price trajectories, with Ethereum underperforming in recent months. While Bitcoin has captured attention for its resilience and gains, Ethereum faces challenges that have weighed on its progress. According to Percival, a CryptoQuant analyst, the new regulatory clarity provided by the pro-crypto administration in the US is contributing to Bitcoin’s strength. In contrast, Ethereum’s internal difficulties, coupled with declining demand in the spot market, have created a challenging environment for the asset. This divergence highlights how the two leading cryptocurrencies are currently moving along very different paths, with Bitcoin thriving and Ethereum struggling to maintain its footing. Related Reading: 1 Million Bitcoin Pulled From Exchanges In The Past 3 Years: What It Means For The BTC Market Ethereum’s Decline and Market Sentiment Percival pointed out that Ethereum’s struggles can be seen in several key metrics. Spot market transactions have dropped dramatically since the previous cycle, with current volumes at $8 billion compared to $52 billion during the bull market’s peak in early 2021. This represents a sharp reduction in demand, signaling that Ethereum’s current bull market participation is significantly diminished. Additionally, data shows that Ethereum has returned to levels seen in 2016, with a majority of trading days now classified as “unprofitable” when compared to Bitcoin. These challenges, according to Percival, have prompted concerns that Ethereum may need to establish a “bottom” before it can regain stability. Without this stabilization, investor sentiment could become increasingly volatile, potentially leading to further price declines. The analyst also suggests that until Ethereum can address its internal issues and rebuild confidence, its underperformance relative to Bitcoin is likely to persist. Bitcoin Momentum And Market Structure While Ethereum struggles, Bitcoin continues to benefit from favorable market conditions and positive sentiment. Percival notes that macroeconomic factors, along with increasing regulatory clarity, have positioned Bitcoin for continued growth. The Choppiness Index, an indicator of market consolidation and trend readiness, currently signals that Bitcoin has built the necessary strength to sustain its upward trajectory. The analyst believes that Bitcoin’s current market structure supports further gains in the coming days. Particularly, after a period of consolidation, Bitcoin appears poised to extend its rally, attracting more investor interest and reinforcing its position as the leading cryptocurrency.

I haven’t checked.” When informed by a reporter that TRUMP had generated billions in market activity within days of its release, Trump quipped, “Several billion? That’s peanuts for these guys,” gesturing toward SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, OpenAI’s Sam Altman, and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, who were present in the room . TRUMP meme coin’s performance The Solana-based TRUMP memecoin achieved a market cap of over $13 billion during its peak over the weekend but has since seen significant volatility. It was the fastest coin to do so and also briefly overtook Shiba Inu as the second biggest meme token in the world after Dogecoin. Its market cap has fallen to approximately $8 billion, with the token currently trading around $42. The decline followed the announcement that First Lady Melania Trump had launched her own memecoin , fueling speculation about potential oversupply and insider ownership. The supply of both tokens is widely believed to be controlled by individuals within the Trump circle, raising questions about market manipulation and ethical implications. TRUMP meme coin’s troubles The rapid rise of the TRUMP memecoin has sparked significant attention across the cryptocurrency ecosystem, with major exchanges like Coinbase and Robinhood listing the token. However, the project’s high-profile nature could complicate bipartisan efforts to pass crypto market structure legislation. A report by TD Cowen warned that the memecoin could introduce partisan tensions as lawmakers and regulators investigate its market implications. Critics argue that the memecoin’s speculative nature may detract from broader crypto reforms aimed at establishing a more transparent and secure financial system. The coins also drew major criticism from the community. Ryan Selkis, former CEO of crypto research firm Messari and a vocal Trump supporter, criticised the decision to proceed with the launch of a second coin, urging President Trump to dismiss the adviser responsible. “They don’t know what they’re doing, they’ve cost you significant money and goodwill, and they don’t have your best interests at heart,” Selkis said in a social media post shortly after the launch of the $MELANIA token. Observers likened the token mechanisms to a “rug pull,” a term used in crypto to describe projects that are abandoned shortly after launch, often resulting in investor losses. Criticism has also centered on the ownership structure, as 80% of the $TRUMP token’s supply is controlled by Fight Fight Fight and CIC Digital, entities affiliated with the Trump Organization, according to the token’s associated website. Furthermore, the terms and conditions for both $TRUMP and $MELANIA prohibit buyers from participating in class-action lawsuits and indemnify the project from any claims. Trump’s pro-crypto promises President Trump has signaled an intent to make cryptocurrency a central pillar of his administration’s policy. He is reportedly preparing an executive order to set cryptocurrency as a national priority. David Sacks, a prominent investor and tech executive, is expected to lead the administration’s crypto efforts as the newly appointed “crypto czar.” Under Trump, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has unveiled a cryptocurrency task force aimed at developing a long-anticipated regulatory framework for digital assets. The announcement follows the resignation of the SEC’s head, Gary Gensler, and the appointment of Mark Uyeda as acting chairman by President Trump. The task force will be led by Hester Peirce, a well-known advocate for cryptocurrencies, The post 'I don’t know much about it': President Trump on meme coin launch appeared first on Invezz",Crypto|Meme Coin|World|Donald Trump|USA,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|SHIB|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Invezz', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",invezz,2025-01-22 05:17:14

Brian Armstrong Weighs New Regulatory Landscape,https://coinpedia.org/news/coinbase-to-delist-usdt-brian-armstrong-weighs-new-regulatory-landscape/,"The post Coinbase to Delist USDT? Brian Armstrong Weighs New Regulatory Landscape appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Trump’s latest remarks after his inauguration on crypto regulations have created a euphoric moment for Bitcoin and other assets. Bitcoin came out of the choppy market with a smashing ATH of $109K. However, there is still fear and panic in the market as many think this new policy change may impact non-US entities. Raining serious doubt and to stay out of controversy, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has hinted that the exchange may delist Tether’s USDT stablecoin if new U.S. legislation mandates stricter compliance requirements. The statement comes as the U.S. crypto industry anticipates regulatory changes that could reshape the stablecoin market. COINBASE CEO: TETHER MIGHT GET KICKED OFF IF THEY DON’T FOLLOW NEW US RULES Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong just dropped a bomb—if US stablecoin regs demand full Treasury backing, Tether’s gonna have to comply or get booted. He said they’d delist USDt if it doesn’t make the cut.… pic.twitter.com/R1waWm73vA — Mario Nawfal’s Roundtable (@RoundtableSpace) January 21, 2025 Regulatory Shifts Could Challenge Tether In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Armstrong predicted that future U.S. regulations might require stablecoin issuers to back their reserves exclusively with U.S. Treasury bonds and undergo regular audits. While Tether already holds a significant portion of its reserves in Treasury bonds, it also diversifies with commodities like Bitcoin and gold, which could put it at odds with potential legislation. The CEO highlighted issues Tether has already faced in the EU under the MiCA framework, which has imposed stricter rules on stablecoin issuers. A similar regulatory push in the U.S. could severely disrupt Tether’s operations, despite its recent move to El Salvador to mitigate regulatory risks. Coinbase’s Position in the Stablecoin Market Armstrong emphasized Coinbase’s readiness to comply with any new laws, even if it means delisting USDT. He also highlighted Coinbase’s relationship with Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, which has positioned itself as a direct competitor to Tether. As a major shareholder in Circle, Coinbase could benefit from a regulatory environment that favors USDC, especially in the U.S. and European markets. Armstrong noted that the stablecoin market, currently valued at $218.7 billion, could see significant shifts if Tether is sidelined by new legislation. Why a Fear for Non-US Entities? Although the U.S. government is showing signs of a more crypto-friendly regulatory stance, enforcement actions remain a possibility, particularly for non-U.S. entities like Tether. Armstrong mentioned that two Senate bills aiming to impose restrictions on stablecoin issuers have been introduced but have yet to gain traction. Armstrong is sure that they will support the changing regulatory scenario even if it means supporting measures that could disrupt Tether’s dominance. This development signals a potential shake-up in the stablecoin market, with implications for both issuers and users. On the other hand, If Tether’s dominance drops it will be a better chance for Ripple’s (RLUSD) and Circle’s (USDC) to capture the market. Notably, Trump had a closed-door meeting this month with Ripple giving more reasons to believe that RLUSD to get a clear way out in the coming months to capture the $ 200 billion stablecoin market.",News|Crypto Regulations|Stablecoin,EN,0,0,USDT|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-22 05:21:13

Additionally, the price of Dogecoin (DOGE) surged after the launch of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) website. However, the website does not mean smooth sailing for the department as it still faces legal scrutiny over transparency concerns. Ross Ulbricht Pardoned by President Trump US President Donald Trump has granted a full pardon to Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the infamous darknet marketplace, Silk Road. Ulbricht spent 12 years in prison, and his supporters, including some well known people in the cryptocurrency community, advocated for years for his pardon. The pardon was announced on the Truth Social platform, and Trump stated that the decision was made in honor of Ulbricht’s mother and the Libertarian Movement, which strongly supported his presidential campaign. He described Ulbricht’s initial sentence of 40 years plus two life terms as “ridiculous.” (Source: Truth Social ) Ulbricht was arrested in 2013 and convicted in 2015 for operating Silk Road, a platform that facilitated the anonymous exchange of goods, including illegal items, using Bitcoin. The platform played a big role in Bitcoin’s early adoption but also drew a lot of legal scrutiny. Trump’s decision is part of his campaign promise to pardon Ulbricht on his first day in office. However, some people were still rather disappointed when Trump prioritized pardons for those connected to the January 6 Capitol attack. The pardon also came after a public appeal from US Senator Rand Paul. He argued that Ulbricht’s sentence was disproportionately harsh compared to others involved in Silk Road operations. Paul specifically referred to the case of Matthew Verran Jones, a high-ranking drug dealer on the platform. Jones received a far lighter sentence of six years. This fueled arguments from Ulbricht’s supporters who believed that he was unfairly vilified and very excessively punished. Throughout the years, Ulbricht consistently contested claims that he was the sole creator and operator of Silk Road, and pointed out that he inherited the platform from its original developer. In a 2013 Forbes interview , he claimed that his involvement was limited to continuing the work of his predecessor, who initially conceptualized the use of Bitcoin and Tor for anonymous transactions. Despite these claims, Ulbricht still became a polarizing figure as some called him a visionary and others were not happy with his role in facilitating illicit trade. Silk Road was among the first platforms to integrate Bitcoin, and it played a huge role in its rise during 2011, when the cryptocurrency reached a then-record price of $32. Amir Taaki and billionaire investor Tim Draper credited Ulbricht’s work with advancing Bitcoin’s prominence. Taaki even referred to Ulbricht’s imprisonment as “the ultimate sacrifice,” especially when considering just how his contributions laid the groundwork for the crypto ecosystem’s growth. During his incarceration, Ulbricht stayed active in the crypto world, and even shared his thoughts on platforms like X. Just days before his pardon, he also warned the community about a fake meme coin bearing his name. Crypto Mom Leads New SEC Crypto Task Force The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) took some of its first steps toward regulatory clarity in the crypto sector after the departure of former Chair Gary Gensler. On Jan. 21, the agency announced that it formed a dedicated crypto task force that will develop a comprehensive framework for digital assets. This initiative will be led by Commissioner Hester Peirce, who is also widely recognized as ”Crypto Mom.” SEC press release The task force was introduced by acting SEC Chairman Mark Uyeda , who is temporarily overseeing the agency until the Senate confirms Paul Atkins, a former SEC Commissioner, as the new chair. According to the SEC, the task force will focus on establishing clear regulatory guidelines, creating pathways for compliance, developing sensible disclosure requirements, and deploying enforcement efforts more effectively. Some of the key appointments to the task force include Richard Gabbert as chief of staff and Taylor Asher as chief policy adviser. The group plans to engage in industry consultations through roundtable discussions to better understand the challenges that are faced by the crypto sector. Additionally, the task force will collaborate with other federal agencies, including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which is led by Acting Chair Caroline Pham, as well as state and international regulators. Historically, the SEC leaned very heavily on enforcement actions to address regulatory concerns in the crypto industry. Under Gensler and his predecessor Jay Clayton, the agency pursued numerous enforcement cases that very often alleged that crypto firms were offering unregistered securities. The regulatory crackdown intensified during the Biden administration, particularly after the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX. For now, President Trump’s second term is expected to bring clearer regulatory pathways for crypto businesses, including rules that define which tokens qualify as securities and clarify oversight responsibilities between federal agencies. Despite this anticipation, Trump has barely said anything on crypto policy since taking office on Jan. 20. Dogecoin Surges as Musk’s DOGE Agency Website Goes Live The ball is rolling in other crypto-related departments as well. Dogecoin (DOGE) surged by more than 11% after the launch of the official website for Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). DOGE is a non-governmental agency that is focused on reducing government spending and streamlining regulations. The agency’s website went live on Jan. 21, which caused a lot of enthusiasm among retail investors who see a symbolic connection between the agency and the cryptocurrency due to the shared acronym and logo. Official DOGE website After the website’s debut, Dogecoin’s price briefly climbed to $0.38 and even surpassed $0.40 before stabilizing at $0.37. Despite this rally, Dogecoin is still below its all-time high of $0.73 that was achieved on May 8 of 2021. However, the meme coin’s market cap has seen some impressive milestones recently, including surpassing Porsche’s $56.1 billion valuation in late 2024, fueled by Musk’s endorsements and speculation around a potential exchange-traded product (ETP) for Dogecoin. However, the Musk-led DOGE agency still faces legal challenges as the public interest law firm National Security Counselors announced plans to sue due to violations of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA). The law firm argues that DOGE failed to meet transparency requirements, including public access to meetings and proper record-keeping.

Launched on January 17, just days before his inauguration, the Solana-based token quickly reached a market cap of $13 billion over the weekend. However, it has since dropped to around $8 billion after a sharp 50% decline, following the launch of a competing memecoin by First Lady Melania Trump. Speaking to reporters, Trump admitted he wasn’t deeply involved in the project, saying, “I don’t know much about it other than I launched it,” but acknowledged its success. When told about its multi-billion-dollar valuation, he joked, “$8 billion? That’s peanuts for these guys,” referencing tech leaders like SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son and OpenAI’s Sam Altman, who were present at the event. However many think this is Trump’s strategy to recover his election campaign spending and this meme mania will fade soon once crypto guidelines are in place. #Trump responded to the $TRUMP token for the first time.

Since its launch, the token has been under fire without any clear crypto regulations it’s like a gamble to invest in memes. Trump’s administration is reportedly planning to make crypto a national policy priority, with an executive order in the works. David Sacks has been appointed as the administration’s crypto czar to guide these efforts. Despite its success, the TRUMP memecoin could complicate ongoing efforts to pass crypto legislation. Analysts warn that its association with Trump may increase political divisions, slowing progress on much-needed regulations. TD Cowen highlighted that investigations into the token’s insider ownership and market influence could further delay bipartisan agreements. Even Mark Cuban, a multi-billionaire and crypto investor believes that TRUMP coin is overhyped and it will be a scam to invest in such projects without clear regulations and will ruin crypto credibility. Getting into the topic of regulations recently Washington Post revealed that in one of Trump’s executive orders, there will be a repealing of controversial SEC crypto accounting guidance, SAB 121. Exchanges Listing TRUMP The TRUMP memecoin is getting more popular as platforms like Coinbase and Robinhood, trading at around $42, up 8.7% in the past 24 hours. Trump’s changing remarks and showing a lack of interest in knowing the memecoins is giving a cold vibe to the crypto investors. Critics are claiming that the token’s popularity might give a perception of crypto as a speculative coin and a gamble taking away its real-world use. The memecoin’s launch is clashing with major tech and Finance development, including a $500 billion AI infrastructure project involving OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank. While the TRUMP token has brought attention to the crypto space, its long-term effects on the industry remain uncertain.",News|Crypto Regulations|Meme Coins,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-22 05:31:32

Ripple’s launch of RLUSD, a fully backed stablecoin that bridges XRP Ledger and Ethereum networks, coupled with its historic SEC victory, has strengthened market confidence. As XRP trades above $2, analysts project values reaching $15 by early 2025. There’s another project called PlutoChain ($PLUTO) that could be worth watching. This Layer-2 solution is getting traction for its potential to revolutionize Bitcoin’s transaction speed. Here’s a closer look at both of these projects. Will XRP Skyrocket to $15? Bold Predictions Point to a Breakout by March 2025 Ripple has recently achieved some big milestones that have strengthened its position in the crypto market. On December 17, 2024, the company launched its U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, Ripple USD (RLUSD) , fully backed by U.S. dollar deposits, government bonds, and cash equivalents. RLUSD is available on both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum blockchains, which ensures its accessibility and utility across different platforms. Initially, RLUSD is listed on exchanges such as Uphold, Bitso, MoonPay, Archax, and CoinMENA, with plans for further expansion to other platforms in the near future. In addition to the RLUSD launch, Ripple secured a favorable outcome in its legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The lawsuit, which began in December 2020, accused Ripple of conducting an unregistered securities offering through the sale of XRP. On July 13, 2023, the court ruled that XRP is not a security, which marked a significant victory for Ripple and the broader cryptocurrency industry. This decision has provided greater regulatory clarity and has been seen as a precedent-setting moment for digital assets in the United States. Following the announcement of RLUSD, XRP’s value experienced an uptick. The legal victory against the SEC has bolstered market sentiment even more, as it alleviated concerns over regulatory uncertainties surrounding XRP. Key resistance levels are identified at $2.25 and $2.30, with a significant hurdle near $2.40. Support levels are observed at $2.12 and $2.05, with a critical support zone around $2.00. Crypto analyst Javon Marks predicts XRP could hit $16.50 in its next growth phase, with the potential for a massive 7,200% surge to $111–$168 in a full market cycle. He notes that current trends suggest XRP is already on track to achieve this bullish outlook. PlutoChain ($PLUTO): A Layer-2 Solution that Could Transform Bitcoin’s Transaction Speed PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could offer a new approach to improving Bitcoin by introducing a Layer-2 solution that may enhance its capabilities. Bitcoin has long faced hurdles like sluggish transaction times, network congestion, and hefty fees, particularly during high-traffic periods. PlutoChain could address these pain points with an additional layer designed to process transactions faster and at a lower cost. With Bitcoin’s average transaction time of 10 minutes, it often lags behind quicker networks such as Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano. PlutoChain offers a block time of 2 seconds on its Layer-2 infrastructure, all while potentially preserving Bitcoin’s renowned security by linking back to its core blockchain. It also integrates with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) seamlessly, which could make it easier for Ethereum developers to build within Bitcoin’s ecosystem. This could create new possibilities for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, NFTs, and AI-powered projects to potentially leverage Bitcoin without complications. The PlutoChain testnet has already proven its ability to meet real-world demands by handling 43,000 transactions daily without experiencing delays. This shows it’s ready to scale for larger operations. The project has also passed rigorous audits from trusted names like SolidProof , QuillAudits , and Assure DeFi . Its governance system allows users to shape the platform’s future by voting on crucial updates, partnerships, and new features. With these advancements, PlutoChain might position itself as a game-changing solution that could address Bitcoin’s longstanding challenges and release its full potential. The Takeaway XRP has had quite a run lately – the RLUSD launch and the big SEC win have given it momentum beyond $2. Another exciting development could be PlutoChain ’s appearance as a potentially promising innovation that may solve Bitcoin’s scalability issues with its Layer-2 solution and EVM compatibility. ———————– This article is purely informational and should not be interpreted as financial advice.

Meanwhile, top market experts have tipped RCO Finance (RCOF) to become the top AI altcoin for 2025. With its innovative AI-powered platform and real-world asset tokenization, RCO Finance is poised for a staggering 30,000x run, making it a life-changing opportunity for investors. According to top market experts, this 30,000X potential will eclipse the historical Dogecoin price rally in 2021. Dogecoin Price Movement: A Concern for Investors As of January 20, 2025, available data on CoinGecko shows that the Dogecoin Price has fallen by over 11% in the last 24 hours. Additionally, DOGE has lost 5.9% of its value in the last 14 days. While the Dogecoin price movement remains a favorite among memecoin enthusiasts, its reliance on community sentiment and social media hype often leads to price volatility. Despite its popularity, the Dogecoin Price movement has struggled to sustain its upward price trajectory. This is where the AI altcoin, RCO Finance (RCOF) steps in, offering a more sustainable and innovative alternative with 30,000X growth potential. RCO Finance (RCOF): The AI Altcoin Revolution The AI altcoin, RCOF, is not just another crypto asset; it’s a groundbreaking AI-powered platform designed to democratize access to sophisticated investment strategies. Currently in its fourth presale stage, RCOF tokens are priced at $0.0777, with top market exerts projecting a historic price surge. With its unique value proposition and potential to revolutionize the $450 billion DeFi market, RCOF is poised for a 30,000X run. Leading market analysts strongly believe that the token will become the top AI altcoin in 2025. With the recent Dogecoin price stagnation, investors flock to this emerging potential gem. The New-Generation RCO Finance Ecosystem The ecosystem comprises cutting-edge and innovative technologies that include: AI-Powered Platform: The Intelligent Robo Advisor RCO Finance redefines financial management with its cutting-edge, AI-driven platform, designed to make advanced investment strategies accessible to all. Unlike traditional platforms that demand expertise or intermediary reliance, RCOF is an entirely automated, no-code solution. This user-friendly approach enables individuals, regardless of experience, to utilize sophisticated tools for optimizing investments. The platform’s Robo Advisor delivers personalized investment strategies tailored to individual financial objectives, risk appetites, and market preferences. Similarly, RCO Finance (RCOF) AI-based market insights offer precise market forecasts and automatic portfolio adjustments. Comprehensive Asset Portfolio The platform provides access to over 120,000 assets, including traditional options like stocks, bonds, and ETFs, alongside digital assets such as cryptocurrencies and tokenized real-world investments like real estate and commodities. This extensive range fosters diversification, balancing risk and reward across 12,500 asset classes. Privacy-Focused, KYC-Free Ecosystem The RCOF ecosystem operates a KYC-free ecosystem, prioritizing user anonymity and privacy. Unlike conventional platforms requiring intrusive identity checks, users can seamlessly access DeFi products without undergoing lengthy verification processes. This frictionless onboarding enhances user experience, appealing to privacy-conscious investors. Tokenization of Real-World Assets The platform introduces a groundbreaking feature: the tokenization of real-world assets. By converting physical assets such as real estate and commodities into blockchain-based tokens, the platform simplifies access to markets that have traditionally been difficult to enter. This innovative approach enables fractional ownership, allowing investors to participate in high-value markets without requiring substantial capital. Through tokenization, users can diversify their portfolios with tangible assets, democratizing access to investments once limited to institutional players or wealthy individuals. Dogecoin Price vs. RCO Finance: A Comparative Analysis While the Dogecoin Price movement has made millionaires in the past, it is largely driven by hype and community sentiment. DOGE lost over 11% in 24 hours and 5.9% within a space of two weeks. This underscores the high susceptibility of the memecoin to the crypto market volatility. On the other hand, the RCOF platform’s unique value proposition, which uses AI-powered tools, tokenizes real-world assets, and has a KYC-free ecosystem, makes it a more stable and sustainable investment option. The platform’s focus on democratizing access to sophisticated investment strategies sets it apart from the speculative nature of the Dogecoin Price. RCO Finance Presale: A 30,000x ROI Opportunity The ongoing RCOF token presale is offering a unique opportunity for early investors. Currently priced at $0.077 in Stage 4, top market experts project a 30,000x rally for this revolutionary token. With this projection, market analysts predict that your $1000 investment in the presale would yield over $298,460. Join the presale to capitalize on this life-changing opportunity and secure massive gains. As the project gains momentum in the market, further growth appears highly likely, making this token presale even more attractive. The token presale has already raised over $11 million, with 83.72% of Stage 4 tokens sold. This traction highlights the strong demand for the AI altcoin and RCOF and the increasing investor confidence in the project. For those aiming to maximize returns, this is the ideal lifetime opportunity. SolidProof , a top blockchain security company, audited the project’s smart contract and found zero vulnerabilities.

SEC to Hold First Closed Meeting with Acting Chair Mark Uyeda appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will hold its first closed meeting since Mark Uyeda took over as acting chair. The meeting, scheduled for Thursday, will involve commissioners, the counsel to the commissioners, the commission’s secretary, and recording secretaries. The topics on the agenda include the institution and settlement of injunctive actions, administrative proceedings, litigation claims resolution, and other matters related to examinations and enforcement. This meeting comes shortly after Judge Torres’s recent decision in the case involving the SEC and Ripple. The court ruled that certain distributions of XRP do not count as securities since there was no investment of money involved. Despite this ruling, the SEC has filed an appeal, arguing that the court made errors in its decision, particularly regarding XRP’s classification when sold on digital asset exchanges. Industry Experts Weigh In Industry experts, including John Deaton, are calling for the case to be dismissed, especially in light of the shifting political landscape. Some suggest that a settlement between Ripple and the SEC is possible, which could clarify certain issues while leaving others unresolved. As the crypto industry continues to grow, public and private sector pressure may influence the SEC’s approach to enforcement-driven regulation. Metalawman recently said that it is likely the SEC will soon release the Inspector General’s report regarding Bill Hinman’s conflicts of interest. He expressed confidence that there is no reason for this act of transparency to be delayed until Paul Atkins’ arrival. Reacting to the same, Deaton said, “Releasing the IG report is an important and necessary step moving forward. If the people in charge don’t support releasing the report then they’re arguably no better than the ones before them.”",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|ALTCOIN|XRP|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-22 05:50:32

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. WhiteBIT TR partners with Misyon Bank to expand cryptocurrency access for European investors amid Turkey’s evolving crypto landscape. WhiteBIT TR cryptocurrency exchange has announced a strategic partnership with Turkish neobank Misyon Bank. The firms have revealed that the goal of this collaboration is to enable Misyon Bank to connect with individual investors across Europe through WhiteBIT TR. According to the terms of the agreement between MisyonTech, the financial technology and digital asset subsidiary of Misyon Bank, and WhiteBIT TR, the latter will provide liquidity for major cryptocurrencies, including BTC, ETH, USDC, USDT, and AVAX, on Turkey’s first bank-secured crypto asset platform. Over the years, Turkey has emerged as a regional leader in the cryptocurrency space. According to insights from Kaiko published last year, over half of the country’s population has invested in crypto. The research firm assigns the increased adoption of crypto assets to macroeconomic factors like rising inflation, devaluation of the country’s currency, and a large population of young, unbanked citizens. In a nod to this growing investment in the crypto sector, the Turkish parliament approved a new crypto legislation in July of last year. This legislation is expected to pull Turkey out of the FATF’s ‘gray list’ of countries with insufficient anti-money laundering measures. It’s also interesting to note that Turkey’s inflationary economic situation has markedly increased the use of stablecoins in the country. According to Kaiko’s research, by July 2024, USDT-TRY was the largest trading pair by volume on Binance, with more than $22 billion. Notably, the meme coin trading volume overshadowed that of Bitcoin in Turkey in 2024. Capitalizing on Turkey’s growing enthusiasm for crypto, several companies have launched exciting new initiatives. The WhiteBIT TR-Misyon partnership can be considered as one such move. At the signing of the partnership, Emre Yetişkin, Chairman of the Board of WhiteBIT TR, praised the progress Misyon Bank made as a pioneer in Turkey’s digital asset space. Meanwhile, Muhammet Cerit, CEO of MisyonTech, stated that WhiteBIT TR, which has been serving Turkish users since 2022, is one of the exchanges that knows the country and its market, standing out in Turkey with its speed and security features. “The agreement we signed today with WhiteBIT TR is the first stage of our goal to reach individual investors in Europe,” said Muhammet Cerit. The leaders of both firms also believe that the new regulations on digital assets in their country have strengthened Turkey’s position as a regional investment hub.

This surge comes amid developments of fresh TRUMP ETF filings with the US SEC on Tuesday. Interestingly, Donald Trump has commented on his meme coin frenzy, which led to strong volatility for the Solana meme coin. TRUMP Price Breakout Sets $54 Target Crypto analyst Ali Martinez reported that TRUMP token has successfully broken out of a falling wedge pattern, a bullish technical indicator. According to Martinez, the token’s breakout positions it for a potential surge, with a TRUMP price target of $54. Source: Ali Charts According to Coinglass data , the TRUMP futures open interest is up 14%, shooting past $1.0 billion, indicating bullish sentiment among traders. Also, the 24-hour liquidations have shot to $24 million, of which $14 million is in short liquidations. Additionally, blockchain analytics firm Santiment reported that TRUMP is still the top trending crypto coin discussed among investors, following its contentious listing on Coinbase. In addition to its market activity, TRUMP has drawn significant attention due to its airdrop events. A recent airdrop distributed $1 million worth of TRUMP tokens, fueling heightened interest and engagement from the crypto community. TRUMP Price Surge Amid ETF Filings Another reason behind the TRUMP price surge today is the recent ETF filings for the newly launched meme coin. On Tuesday, REX Financial and Osprey Funds submitted their filings to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a potential TRUMP ETF. Interestingly, this filing comes just three days after the launch of the Official Trump (TRUMP) meme coin. It also outlines REX-Osprey’s plans to introduce a range of crypto-focused funds. In addition to TRUMP ETF, Rex also submitted ETF filings for other meme coins like Dogecoin and BONK. Donald Trump Comments Stir Volatility When asked about the TRUMP meme coin launch during yesterday’s press briefing to reports, the President said: “I don’t know much about it other than I launched it. I heard it was very successful. I haven’t checked.” During a press briefing, a reporter noted that the TRUMP price surge generated several billion dollars in the past few days. In response, the president quipped, “Several billion? That’s peanuts for these guys,” gesturing toward SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son, OpenAI’s Sam Altman, and Oracle’s Larry Ellison, who were present in the room. Meanwhile, Donald Trump’s comments instantly triggered sharp volatility in the meme coin. Soon after the US President made his comments at 6:00 PM ET, three minutes later, the TRUMP coin experienced a sharp 33% drop in value. Buy-The-Dip Strategy Fuels Discussions Notably, a wallet seized the opportunity, purchasing $5.09 million worth of the token at the exact bottom of the dip. This transaction marks one of the largest single purchases since the coin’s launch, reported The Kobeissi Letter. The market quickly rebounded, and within 14 minutes, the trader’s investment had already gained $2.4 million in value. The timing of the purchase has raised doubts about whether it’s an insider job.

While Dogecoin, Solana, and XRP have stolen headlines, a new crypto is quietly building momentum, poised to deliver gains that could eclipse them all in 2025. Could this be the stealth investment opportunity the crypto world has been waiting for? Let’s find out. Introducing Rollblock: The new crypto turning online casinos into a 50x investment opportunity They say a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity doesn’t come around often, but what if the next big crypto is about to surprise us all? Meet Rollblock , the GambleFi protocol reshaping online casinos. Armed with a glut of exciting features, Rollblock seeks to combine the strengths of both decentralized and centralized gaming, giving users the best of both worlds. With over $8.9 million raised and 55 million tokens sold in its 9th presale stage , Rollblock isn’t just betting on growth—it’s stacking the odds in its favor. This new crypto also offers staking rewards and future utility potential, like partnerships with other platforms. Imagine a coin that earns while you play—a digital jackpot in the making. This could really be the token that outpaces Dogecoin, Solana, and XRP. Is Solana pacing itself for a record-breaking 2025? Over the past month, Solana (SOL) has shown some bold price moves, with highs around $219 and a mid-month cooldown near $196. It’s like watching a seasoned sprinter pace themselves for the marathon ahead—SOL knows the game isn’t just about short bursts. And while it’s an impressive contender, one wonders if a new crypto like Rollblock could outpace even SOL’s marathon gains in 2025. Dogecoin holders play the long game: is $0.48 within reach? Dogecoin is growing from its meme days into something more serious. Instead of buying and selling quickly, more short-term holders are now holding onto their DOGE for much longer. This change means fewer people are selling all at once, which can help keep the price steady and even push it higher. On top of that, there’s a lot of interest in Dogecoin for long-term trades, as shown by something called a positive funding rate (basically, more people want to buy than sell). If these holders keep holding, DOGE could rise to $0.48. XRP’s surge in trader interest signals big potential, but caution remains XRP has been showing a lot of interest from traders, with $1.6 billion added recently, showing they expect its price to rise. More people are betting on XRP’s growth, which is why they’re getting involved in large amounts. XRP’s price had been stuck between $2.18 and $2.73, but it finally broke through the $3 barrier. Now all eyes are on topping its ATH. Much like Rollblock’s rise, both have people excited for what’s next, showing how investors are always looking for the next big opportunity. Conclusion Rollblock has been the crypto world’s best-kept secret—until now. With its fresh take on online casinos and a solid presale performance, this coin might just outperform the big names like Dogecoin, Solana, and XRP. With features like staking rewards and token buybacks, it’s stacking the odds in its favor. This could be the crypto surprise you’ve been waiting for!

Trump met with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, and Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison at the White House to announce the company. The President also said Stargate will be the “largest AI infrastructure project in history.” SoftBank plans to pour $500 billion into Stargate Announcing The Stargate Project The Stargate Project is a new company which intends to invest $500 billion over the next four years building new AI infrastructure for OpenAI in the United States. We will begin deploying $100 billion immediately. This infrastructure will secure… — OpenAI (@OpenAI) January 21, 2025 Trump announced that OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle will create Stargate to grow artificial intelligence infrastructure in the United States. The firms also said they will begin with an initial $100 billion investment into Stargate and plan to invest up to $500 billion in the coming years. Trump also acknowledged that the project is expected to create 100,000 jobs in the U.S. The president highlighted that Stargate would build the physical and virtual infrastructure to power the next generation of AI, including data centers nationwide. Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison also revealed that the group’s first 1 million-square-foot data project was already under construction in Texas. “Infrastructure in the United States is super important, AI…requires massive amounts of infrastructure, power, computer chips, data centers, and we need to build that here and we need to be able to have the best AI infrastructure in the world to be able to lead with the technology.” – Sam Altman , CEO of OpenAI. Leaders from AI companies have been advocating for months for more data centers to power their artificial intelligence ambitions in the coming years. Altman said that he believes Stargate will be the “most important project” in this era. He also maintained that the companies would not have been able to bring Stargate to fruition without Trump. OpenAI’s CEO had previously urged U.S. officials to help in the infrastructure buildout to ensure the country remained ahead of China in the AI arms race. Altman argued that AI was poised to impact everything from the economy to military capabilities in the coming years. He also met with Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son last year to solicit investment in new semiconductor plants for building AI chips. Altman also said last month that he believes Trump will “be very good at” attracting AI infrastructure investments to the United States and that he was looking forward to working with Trump’s administration on such investments. Altman hopes Stargate will secure American leadership in AI OpenAI published a policy white paper last week revealing that investment in the U.S. AI infrastructure can ensure that U.S. AI tools win over Chinese technology. The report also highlighted that investment in U.S. AI infrastructure will create new jobs and economic opportunities. OpenAI also urged the U.S. government to create a foundational strategy to ensure that investment in infrastructure benefits Americans and maximizes access to AI. The AI company also estimated that it had $175 billion in global funds awaiting investment in AI projects. The firm argued that if the U.S. did not attract those funds, they would flow to China-backed projects, strengthening the Chinese Communist Party’s global influence. Oracle also acknowledged that the Stargate project will secure American leadership in AI. The firm added that the project will create hundreds of thousands of American jobs and generate massive economic benefits for the entire world. According to Oracle, Stargate will not only support the re-industrialization of the U.S. but also provide a strategic capability to protect the national security of America and its allies. OpenAI said SoftBank will have financial responsibility for the project, and Son will be Stargate’s chairman. The firm also said it will have operational responsibility for the project. According to OpenAI, a fourth partner, MGX, will also contribute funding to Stargate. The President also reversed former president Joe Biden’s executive order that aimed to monitor and regulate AI risks.

This timeline may bring hope to crypto investors and businesses alike, but challenges remain, including political disagreements and unexpected distractions like the TRUMP memecoin. Why Crypto Regulations Are Crucial? A note from TD Cowen’s Washington Research Group, led by Jaret Seiberg, highlighted the importance of bipartisan support in advancing the crypto market structure bill. The absence of clear regulations has limited the growth of the crypto market in the U.S. Without legal certainty, potential investors remain hesitant, and businesses face operational uncertainties. Such legislation is crucial for resolving regulatory gray areas, which have slowed the growth of the crypto sector. Seiberg’s team notes that political divides could delay these critical advancements. Impact of the TRUMP Memecoin One unexpected factor affecting crypto legislation is the launch of the TRUMP memecoin, a cryptocurrency introduced by former President Donald Trump. The token launched days before his inauguration, saw an initial market capitalization of over $14 billion before losing nearly half its value. It now trades at around $42 with a market cap of $8 billion. TD Cowen’s analysts warned that the launch of TRUMP could worsen partisan disagreements, further delaying progress on crypto legislation. Democrats are expected to investigate the token’s price movements and whether it was used by foreign entities to gain influence. Republicans, on the other hand, are likely to defend Trump, making it harder to build the bipartisan cooperation needed to pass the bill. Reputational Risks for the Crypto Industry Critics from both the crypto industry and the policy community have expressed concerns about the TRUMP memecoin. Many believe it distracts from the industry’s broader goals and adds reputational risks. However, Jaret Seiberg’s team at TD Cowen notes that bipartisan cooperation is crucial for passing crypto legislation.",News,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|BUSINESS|FIAT|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-22 05:59:19

Many crypto enthusiasts see this as an indicator of the meme coin trend having its best days behind it. Increasingly, investors are eying up projects with clear value propositions rather than a funny picture with playful branding. One standout in 2025 is Remittix, a powerful PayFi project currently gaining massive traction in its presale, which has yielded over $4.6 million in investments in record time. So could this be the end for meme coins or might Shiba Inu and Dogecoin bounce back? So, what’s capturing all the attention around Remittix? Shiba Inu Losing Its Uniqueness Shiba Inu (SHIB) is inarguably one of the great pioneers of the meme coin space, though things have been looking bleak lately, with price dips across the board. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is now trading at $0.00002122. So what is contributing to this downfall? Well Shiba Inu (SHIB), is likely feeling the weight of an oversaturated market. With countless meme-inspired coins emerging, Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) unique charm seems to be losing its edge. Despite efforts to expand its ecosystem with Shibarium Layer-2, NFTs and gaming initiatives, the broader market sentiment seems to be changing. One thing that Shiba Inu does have going for it is that it has a very loyal holderbase. On-chain analytics suggest that over 74% of holders are long-term holders, while only 21.85% are cruisers, which is significantly lower than the ratio for most meme coins. Dogecoin (DOGE) Clings On, Posting Small Gains Despite the wider meme coin downturn, Dogecoin (DOGE) is holding on surprisingly well, having even posted over a 6% gain in the last week and a net 20% increase over the last month. Dogecoin (DOGE) is still battling market saturation though, in line with other meme coins. Dogecoin’s price has struggled to maintain the momentum it had in 2024, despite occasional Elon Musk endorsements. Dogecoin (DOGE) remains vulnerable in a highly competitive market as newer projects promising deep utility threaten to overshadow meme coins entirely. Remittix Sets a New Standard in PayFi While meme coins falter, a growing number of investors are gravitating toward projects offering tangible, real-world applications. Remittix (RTX) is capturing attention with its focus on transforming cross-border payments, a market valued at $190 trillion. By bridging cryptocurrencies and fiat systems, Remittix (RTX) is addressing inefficiencies in traditional financial systems. The platform enables users to convert over 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat and transfer funds globally, free from hidden fees or delays. Businesses benefit from the Remittix Pay API, which simplifies the integration of crypto payments while offering fiat settlement options. With support for more than 50 cryptocurrency pairs and 30 fiat currencies, the platform streamlines international transactions and reduces costs. The multi-currency wallet on Remittix (RTX) also lets users manage fiat and crypto assets from one account. This is a welcome tool for freelancers and global businesses that process international payments in multiple currencies. Investors Race To Secure Their Share Of RTX The resilient native token, RTX, is priced at $0.0256 during its presale with more than $4.6 million raised so far. This fast-moving presale reflects a strong investor appetite for the Remittix (RTX) value proposition and analysts expect an 800% price surge by the presale close and a 5,000% rally after launch. For investors looking for an application focused project with high growth potential, Remittix is a standout. Positioned to disrupt the cross-border payments market, this project is shaping up to lead the PayFi space in 2025.

Circle’s acquisition of Hashnote, the issuer of the popular tokenized money fund US Yield Coin (USYC), and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong’s predictions on stricter US stablecoin regulations bring attention to a pivotal moment for the industry. Both moves show the growing importance of compliance, transparency, and innovation in integrating stablecoins and tokenized assets into mainstream finance. Coinbase CEO Predicts Stricter Stablecoin Regulations: Implications for the Market and Offshore Players Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has made a bold prediction regarding the future of stablecoin regulation in the United States, suggesting that issuers may soon be required to fully back their dollar-pegged tokens with US Treasury bills. This move, he believes, could create significant challenges for offshore stablecoin providers operating in the American market. Armstrong shared his thoughts during an interview with The Wall Street Journal at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, signaling a transformative period for the cryptocurrency industry. According to Armstrong, impending stablecoin legislation in the United States is likely to demand stricter compliance measures. These may include backing stablecoins entirely with US Treasury bonds and undergoing periodic audits. Such requirements aim to ensure greater transparency and security in the stablecoin sector, reinforcing trust among users and regulators alike. While these changes could bolster the legitimacy of stablecoins, they also present significant hurdles for issuers that fail to meet the stringent criteria. Armstrong specifically called out Tether (USDT), one of the most widely used stablecoins, as potentially vulnerable to the new regulatory framework. He noted that Coinbase might delist USDT in the US market if Tether cannot comply with forthcoming legislation. “There are a lot of people with Tether, and we want to give them an off-ramp if we want to help them transition to a system that we think is more secure,” Armstrong stated. Despite these concerns, Coinbase intends to continue offering USDT services in the interim to facilitate customer access to other cryptocurrency assets. Coinbase’s approach to stablecoin compliance is already evident in its European operations. In anticipation of the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), the exchange delisted USDT and other stablecoins that fell short of the regulatory requirements. A Coinbase spokesperson clarified that the company remains open to relisting such stablecoins should they achieve MiCA compliance in the future. This proactive stance is part of Coinbase’s commitment to aligning its operations with global regulatory standards, potentially setting an industry benchmark for other exchanges. The global stablecoin market, valued at approximately $218.7 billion, has become a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency industry. With the top five stablecoins accounting for 92% of the market share, any regulatory changes are likely to have a far-reaching impact. Stablecoins have gained prominence for their utility in facilitating seamless transactions and acting as a bridge between traditional finance and digital assets. However, their rapid growth has also attracted heightened scrutiny from regulators, who are keen to address potential risks related to financial stability and consumer protection. US Stablecoin Legislation: A Top Priority for Lawmakers In the United States, stablecoin regulation has emerged as a critical area of focus for policymakers. Republican Representative Tom Emmer, vice chairman of the House Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology, and Artificial Intelligence, has identified stablecoin legislation as Congress’ top priority in the crypto space. “Passing comprehensive market structure and stablecoin legislation” is seen as essential to cementing the US dollar’s position as the global reserve currency. The Payment Stablecoin Act, proposed by Senators Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand, is a key legislative effort in this regard. Introduced in April 2024, the act aims to establish a clear regulatory framework for stablecoins while reinforcing the dollar’s dominance in global finance. The proposed changes to US stablecoin regulations present both challenges and opportunities for the industry. For issuers like Tether, compliance with stricter requirements could necessitate significant operational changes, potentially reshaping the competitive landscape. Offshore companies may find it increasingly difficult to serve the US market, opening the door for domestic players to solidify their positions. For Coinbase and other exchanges, the evolving regulatory environment offers an opportunity to strengthen their market presence by demonstrating compliance and fostering consumer trust. By proactively addressing regulatory concerns, Coinbase is positioning itself as a leader in the push for a more secure and transparent cryptocurrency ecosystem. As US lawmakers prepare to roll out comprehensive stablecoin regulations, the industry faces a pivotal moment. The decisions made in the coming months will not only shape the future of stablecoins but also influence the broader cryptocurrency landscape. For Armstrong and Coinbase, the focus remains on navigating these changes while supporting customers in transitioning to compliant and secure systems. With a market valued in the hundreds of billions and the stakes higher than ever, the stablecoin sector stands at the forefront of crypto innovation and regulation. Whether the new rules will foster growth or stifle innovation remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: the eyes of the world are on stablecoins, and the next chapter in their evolution is about to be written. Circle Acquires Hashnote, Strengthening Its Position in Tokenized Real-World Asset Market In related news, Stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Financial has taken a significant step in expanding its influence in the tokenized asset space by acquiring Hashnote, the issuer of the tokenized real-world asset (RWA) fund known as US Yield Coin (USYC). This strategic acquisition positions Circle to further capitalize on the rapidly growing market for tokenized money funds and real-world assets. In a Jan. 21 announcement, Circle highlighted the transformative potential of the acquisition. The integration of Hashnote and its flagship token USYC is expected to make USYC a “preferred form of yield-bearing collateral” across crypto exchanges, custodians, and prime brokers. US Yield Coin, or USYC, is currently the most popular tokenized money fund by market capitalization, with a total value locked (TVL) of approximately $1.25 billion, according to data from RWA.xyz . Circle’s announcement emphasized that USYC's strong position in the market would complement its own USD Coin (USDC) ecosystem, creating synergies between tokenized money market fund (TMMF) collateral and stablecoin liquidity. As part of the acquisition, Circle has entered into a partnership with DRW, one of the largest institutional crypto trading firms. This collaboration will expand DRW’s institutional-grade liquidity and settlement services in both USDC and USYC, enabling more efficient collateral management across platforms. Circle’s announcement further detailed plans to fully integrate USYC with USDC. The move aims to provide seamless access between tokenized collateral like USYC and Circle’s widely adopted stablecoin, USDC. This integration is expected to streamline financial operations for institutional users, providing enhanced liquidity, security, and ease of use. The acquisition comes at a time when demand for tokenized real-world assets is skyrocketing. These assets, represented as digital tokens, offer claims on tangible items such as US Treasury bonds, money market funds, and even artworks. According to Colin Butler, Polygon’s global head of institutional capital, tokenized RWAs represent a $30-trillion market opportunity globally. Tokenized money market funds, in particular, have seen significant interest due to their backing by highly liquid, yield-bearing assets like US Treasury bills. Hashnote’s USYC faces competition from other significant players, including the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) and the Franklin OnChain US Government Money Fund (FOBXX), which boast TVLs of $630 million and $525 million, respectively. Circle’s USD Coin (USDC) remains the second-largest stablecoin in the cryptocurrency market, with a market capitalization of approximately $48 billion. Despite trailing Tether’s USDt, which has a market cap of around $138 billion, USDC has been steadily gaining market share, particularly since December. Concerns over Tether’s compliance with the European Union’s MiCA have bolstered confidence in USDC as a compliant and transparent alternative. This growing confidence aligns with Circle’s focus on regulatory compliance and operational transparency, making it an attractive choice for institutional and retail users alike. The integration of Hashnote’s USYC is expected to further strengthen Circle’s competitive position in the stablecoin and tokenized asset sectors. The Promise and Risks of T-Bill Tokenization The tokenization of US Treasury bills (T-bills) and other real-world assets has been touted as a game-changer for financial markets. The US Treasury Department, in an October report, acknowledged the potential of T-bill tokenization to drive operational improvements and innovation. However, it also warned of potential risks to financial stability, highlighting the need for robust regulatory oversight. Circle’s acquisition of Hashnote and its strategic alignment with institutional players like DRW show the company’s commitment to navigating these challenges while unlocking new opportunities in the tokenized asset market. The acquisition of Hashnote marks a pivotal moment for Circle as it expands its reach in the tokenized real-world asset sector. By integrating USYC into its ecosystem and partnering with institutional leaders, Circle aims to redefine the landscape of tokenized collateral and stablecoins. As the market for tokenized assets continues to grow, Circle’s strategic moves could solidify its position as a leader in this space, offering innovative solutions that bridge the gap between traditional finance and blockchain technology.

Trump’s World Liberty Financial Propels LINK Price Up In a series of rapid transactions completed within just 15 minutes, World Liberty Financial purchased 220,000 LINK tokens, totaling an impressive $5.63 million, according to Chinese reporter Wu Blockchain. This strategic move was accompanied by additional acquisitions, including 13,000 Aave (AAVE) tokens valued at $4.41 million and 37.267 million TRON (TRX) tokens worth $8.86 million. Related Reading: World Liberty Financial Raises $1B: Trump-Backed Crypto Venture To Extend Token Sales The buying pressure generated by these transactions contributed to a notable 44% uptrend in LINK’s price over a two-week period, with a more immediate increase of over 11% within just 24 hours. But despite this bullish momentum, LINK’s price remains approximately 49% below its all-time high of $52.70, achieved during the 2021 bull run as it is currently hovering little over above the $26 mark. In a social media post on X (formerly Twitter), WLFI detailed these acquisitions, stating that they were made to commemorate the inauguration of Donald J. Trump as the 47th President of the United States. The post highlighted additional purchases, including $47 million in Ethereum (ETH), $47 million in wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC), and similar amounts in AAVE, LINK, TRX, and Ethena (ENA). How Chainlink Could Double In Value The involvement of the Trump family in the crypto space has sparked excitement among bullish LINK investors, fostering renewed confidence in the token’s prospects. Analysts like Michael van de Poppe have weighed in, noting that LINK has recently experienced a standard 30% correction—a pattern seen more than 15 times in previous cycles. Despite this, van de Poppe anticipates an upward price movement for Chainlink toward the $35 mark as market conditions stabilize. Adding to the positive sentiment, market expert Ali Martinez reported a significant withdrawal of over 770,000 LINK tokens from crypto exchanges on Tuesday, suggesting that investors are increasingly confident in LINK’s potential and a possible continuation of the uptrend observed over the past month. Related Reading: Is It Time To Give Up On Ethereum Below $4,000? Analyst Weighs The Facts Satoshi Flipper also chimed in on LINK’s price action, expressing optimism about the token’s adoption and future performance. He noted the emergence of a falling wedge pattern that could propel LINK toward its all-time high, suggesting that a price doubling from current levels is feasible. Flipper emphasized the importance of Chainlink in the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem, arguing that dismissing the potential for further gains before reaching new highs would be a mistake. Interestingly, Aixbt recently pointed out that LINK’s monthly Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 67, approaching the critical 70 level that previously triggered a dramatic 375% price surge. This setup mirrors the conditions that drove the price from $3.50 to $20 in an earlier cycle. If history were to repeat itself, such a surge could push LINK toward the $124.80 mark, nearly tripling its current peak.

Trump continued to add that “the scum that worked to convict him were some of the same lunatics who were involved in the modern-day weaponization of government against me. He was given two life sentences, plus 40 years. Ridiculous!” Ross Ulbricht has been freed by President Trump with a full pardon! Thank you for keeping your word to me and others who have been advocating for Ross’ freedom, Mr. President! #freeRoss pic.twitter.com/wOJVFX1DaA — Thomas Massie (@RepThomasMassie) January 22, 2025 Ross Ulbricht Finally Free The Silk Road founder was serving a life sentence after being convicted of running an underground online marketplace that was used by drug dealers to conduct illicit sales using Bitcoin. Ulbricht created and operated Silk Road, one of the first modern darknet markets, from 2011 until his arrest in 2013. The site worked on the Tor network and used crypto for transactions, allowing users to buy and sell goods anonymously. Ulbricht, who used the pseudonym “Dread Pirate Roberts” (DPR), was an ardent libertarian who believed in free market principles and opposed drug prohibition laws. He was convicted in May 2015 on seven charges, including distributing narcotics, computer hacking, conspiracy, and money laundering. He received two life sentences plus 40 years without the possibility of parole. “I wanted to empower people to make choices in their lives and have privacy and anonymity,” Ulbricht said at his sentencing hearing. Supporters have long advocated for clemency, arguing his sentence was disproportionately harsh and that Silk Road reduced violence in the drug trade by moving it online. Waiting on Crypto EOs Trump had announced plans to commute Ulbricht’s sentence in May during a speech at the Libertarian National Convention. “Thanks to President Trump for keeping his word to end Ross’s unjust sentence by granting him a full and unconditional pardon. Prayers have been answered for Ross, Lyn (his mother), and all their family and friends. So happy for them!” commented former Congressman Justin Amash. The crypto community is still waiting with bated breath for Trump to sign executive orders relating to the industry and pro-crypto regulations . He has been silent on the subject so far.

Crypto journalist Zack Guzman called the appointment “insanely bullish” for the industry, noting that Peirce had previously outlined three key predictions about the future of a pro-crypto SEC, and that those predictions are increasingly likely to come true. One of Peirce’s main criticisms of the SEC has been its reliance on enforcement actions as a regulatory tool. Under his leadership, a newly formed crypto task force aims to create a comprehensive and transparent framework for compliance. “Today’s announcement to establish a task force to finally establish clear rules confirms the ‘day one’ changes he envisioned,” Guzman said. The move away from retroactive sanctions marks a potential turning point for the industry by offering a roadmap for compliance instead of vague guidelines.

Analytics Company Shares Its Strategy Peirce has long advocated an approach that fosters innovation while protecting investors. He envisions a regulatory environment where developers and founders can create new technologies without constant fear of sanctions. Peirce Predicted Staking Could Be Allowed in Ethereum Spot ETFs in New Administration Perhaps the most significant of Peirce’s predictions involves the SEC potentially approving staking-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which Guzman noted could be one reason why the Ethereum Foundation recently made strategic moves regarding staking. “Peirce predicted that the SEC could possibly move ‘early’ to greenlight staking through ETFs, which would be a huge development,” Guzman said. *This is not investment advice.

The comments come amid calls from the community to promote researcher and developer Danny Ryan, whose contributions to Ethereum’s transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake have been widely praised.

Ryan’s supporters argue that his expertise aligns with Ethereum’s long-term goals, positioning him as a strong candidate for leadership despite Buterin’s firm stance on maintaining control over Foundation decisions. Meanwhile, Miyaguchi, who has held this role since 2018, has faced criticism from community members on X, with some blaming her for inefficiencies within the Foundation. Recently, well-followed crypto trader CoinMamba, a vocal critic of the Ethereum Foundation, called for the resignation of Miyaguchi. We got some momentum here. With @AyaMiyagotchi resigning $ETH can reach ATH in 2 weeks. — CoinMamba (@coinmamba) January 19, 2025 CoinMamba urged the community to maintain pressure on the Foundation, reasoning that such efforts could lead to her stepping down, which could positively impact Ethereum’s trajectory. In response, Buterin firmly dismissed the idea, stating that he is solely responsible for deciding the Ethereum Foundation’s leadership team. He lashed back against the community’s recent attacks and criticized community members for creating a toxic environment for Ethereum’s “top talent.” “YOU ARE MAKING MY JOB HARDER. And you are decreasing the chance I have any interest whatsoever in doing “what you want,” he added.

Instead, they suggested that the foundation should focus more on practical solutions, such as increasing developer support through hackathons and grants, rather than engaging in philosophical debates over leadership.

He pointed out that the EF is “only one part” of the broader ecosystem and suggested focusing on reforming other organizations like Consensys, which could take on more responsibilities. He added: “EF should not “midcurve”, it should confidently represent the aspects of Ethereum that it can be effective at representing and deliberately create and nurture open space for other orgs to represent the other aspects of Ethereum.” As previously reported by crypto.news, the Ethereum Foundation has also faced criticism regarding its financial practices, particularly concerning the management of its ETH holdings. Community members have expressed concerns over the Foundation’s periodic sales of ETH, questioning why it opts to liquidate assets instead of leveraging staking opportunities.

Market sentiment was further dampened by caution ahead of China’s Lunar New Year holiday, as well as upcoming interest rate decisions from the Bank of Japan and the US Federal Reserve. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 1.78% to surpass 39,500, while the broader Topix Index gained 0.7% to 2,732 on Wednesday, reaching their highest levels in nearly two weeks. The Japanese yen steadied around 155.6 per dollar on Wednesday, pausing its recent rally which was fueled by expectations that the Bank of Japan would raise interest rates this week following hawkish remarks from central bank officials. China ( SHCOMP ) fell 0.98% to around 3,210 while the Shenzhen Component tumbled 1.1% to 10,185 on Wednesday, after US President Donald Trump said his team was discussing a 10% tariff on goods imported from China that could take effect as early as Feb. 1. The offshore yuan depreciated past 7.28 per dollar, extending its losses from the previous session. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 1.55% to 19,787 in early trade on Wednesday, ending gains in the prior six sessions. India ( SENSEX ) rose 0.40% to 76,176 in morning trade on Wednesday, as traders took profits after hitting a more than seven-month low in the prior session. Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.33% to close at 8,430 on Wednesday, hitting its highest level in nearly seven weeks during the session. The Westpac-Melbourne Institute Leading Economic Index in Australia remained unchanged month-over-month in December 2024, following a 0.1% rise in the previous month. In the U.S., on Tuesday, all three major indexes ended higher with the S&P 500 adding 0.9%, the Nasdaq gaining 0.6%, and the Dow jumping 538 points, supported by relief over President Trump’s unexpectedly softer trade measures after his first day in office. U.S. stock futures rose on Wednesday following a strong market rally in the previous session: Dow +0.02% ; S&P 500 +0.29% ; Nasdaq +0.68% .

Arbitrum Has Been Trading Inside A Descending Triangle Recently In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a Descending Triangle pattern forming in the 4-hour price of Arbitrum. The “Descending Triangle” refers to a formation from technical analysis (TA) that, as its name suggests, looks like a triangle slopped downwards. The pattern involves two trendlines between which the asset consolidates: an upper level drawn by connecting together lower highs in the price and a lower one parallel to the time-axis that joins bottoms. Like in many other TA patterns, the upper line is considered to be a point of probable resistance for the price, while the lower one can act as support. Related Reading: Trader Greed Strikes Again: Bitcoin Corrects To $102,000 After FOMO Spike Breaks out of either of these lines can imply a continuation of trend in that direction. An escape above the triangle is naturally a bullish signal, while a drop under it can foreshadow a bearish outcome. Similar to the Descending Triangle, there is also another pattern called the Ascending Triangle, which forms when the consolidation occurs towards an overall upside. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the Descending Triangle that the 4-hour price of Arbitrum has been trading inside during the last couple of months: As displayed in the above graph, the Arbitrum 4-hour price retested the upper level of the Descending Triangle a few days ago, but it found rejection as it has since plunged down. Yesterday, the coin saw a very brief retest of the lower line, but it appears this level is also holding for the cryptocurrency as its price has found a rebound from it. Related Reading: XRP Whale Binance Deposits Skyrocket: Key Holders Preparing For Profit-Taking? It’s likely that these levels won’t hold for long, however, as ARB is fast approaching the apex of the triangle. As the range gets narrower, the chances of a breakout (in either direction) become higher. At present, Arbitrum is trading right in the middle of the two levels, so it’s uncertain which one it would be traveling to next. Martinez notes that if the breakout happens towards the upside, then the cryptocurrency could end up enjoying a surge of around 46%. This figure is based on the fact that the height of the triangle involves a price swing of this percentage. It only remains to be seen whether ARB would be able to find a break above the Descending Triangle or not. ARB Price At the time of writing, Arbitrum is trading around $0.72, up 1% over the last 24 hours.

With the advent of more DeFi protocols, everyday money-spenders and more financial enthusiasts across different markets will soon start to flood the blockchain network, taking digital money to the next level. However, this starts with the emergence of DeFi projects that are fully focused on enhancing security, speed, interoperability, and overall user convenience. This is the exact goal Elluminex (ELX) is chasing, and it’s leveraging one of the fastest and most modern blockchain networks, TON, to achieve this feat. The DeFi market has already been forecasted to reach $231.19 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 42.5%. Considering the unparalleled scalability and user base that TON blockchain has to offer, Elluminex is well-placed to capture a substantial share of this expanding market. Keep on reading to find out the potential embedded in this new entrant. Elluminex Is An All-In-One DeFi Hub Making Cross-Chain Operability Smooth Than Ever As an all-in-one DeFi platform built to take advantage of the nearly one billion users on the TON blockchain , Elluminex (ELX) is expected to rally significantly. Its smooth and user-friendly multi-chain ecosystem has been designed to not only allow trading, staking, and farming but users can also track crypto assets with AI-powered portfolio trackers. This improves asset management by providing real-time market insights to help investors with smart trading decisions. Typically, Elluminex offers a DEX protocol with high liquidity, minimum slippage, and advanced trading features. Traders who are looking to engage in cross-chain swaps and token offerings can earn their $ELX native token by joining its liquidity farming. Interestingly, token holders have exclusive pre-market access to new tokens on the TON network, meaning they can invest in promising projects before they get listed on exchange platforms. Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of Elluminex multi-chain DEX is its educational hub which was designed to eradicate DeFi illiteracy. This strategic focus on community involvement and user empowerment is primed to set Elluminex up as the next best DEX protocol that not only allows cross-chain trading alone but also empowers its users to learn more about DeFi and take full advantage of the best DeFi opportunities. The Potential Elluminex Has For Delivering Massive Growth On The TON Blockchain One of the most noteworthy features of the Elluminex (ELX) platform is its token burn mechanism. This makes sure that its native token goes through a deflationary cycle that decreases the supply of its token over time, thereby causing a monumental rise in its value. Beyond this, Elluminex’s potential for continuous growth is tied to its connection to the TON blockchain . As it ventures into the untapped DeFi market on TON, there are speculations that this new entrant could realize a bullish rally when it launches on the mainstream market. Already signaling itself as a solution to major bottlenecks in the decentralization finance sector, Elluminex is primed to outperform the likes of Jupiter, Uniswap, and PancakeSwap to rank as the best exchange platform. Having just started its ICO phase, Elluminex is still regarded as one of the top DeFi projects with a lot of potential to realize. Given the increased market players’ interest that its presale will garner coupled with its token burn mechanism, Elluminex’s native token is primed to reach significant heights as market participants who get in now have a solid chance of reaping immeasurable returns. Is Elluminex Capable Of Becoming The Highest-Growing DeFi Platform In 2025? The possibility of Elluminex ranking as the highest-growing DeFi platform in 2025 is possibly considered its untapped potential in the DeFi market. While it may not rank among the best DeFi platforms, it can potentially surpass all other DeFi protocols when its 2025 gains alone are considered.

A closer look at on-chain data shows other bullish signals are emerging that support a potential bounce. Technical analysis reveals the price is primed for a breakout rally to $4,000. Ethereum Price Today: Reversal Likely as Whales Accumulate ETH In anticipation of Donald Trump’s inauguration ceremony, Bitcoin (BTC) price struck an ATH of $109K over the weekend. This uptick caused many altcoins to shoot up, but Ethereum price remains rangebound and currently trades around No data found for ethereum on 55 minutes ago as of No data found for ethereum on 55 minutes ago. From a daily high of No data found for ethereum on 55 minutes ago ETH’s value is down No data found for ethereum on 55 minutes ago% on January 22. While the shor-term performance has been uninspiring, the outlook is likely to change for Ethereum, as suggested by on-chain metrics, whale accumulation data and technical analysis. All these bullish signals suggest that the price could bounce and revisit $4,000 soon. *Ethereum price updated as of No data found for ethereum on 55 minutes ago. Network Activity Spikes: Is New Capital Flowing into ETH? Data from Santiment shows that the Network Growth indicator has spiked to 180K after hovering around 90K for the past three months. This indicator tracks new wallets joining the Ethereum blockchain and suggests that these investors are interested in buying ETH at the current levels. Hence, Network Growth can be interpreted as capital inflow. This metric spiked in May 2024 after Ethereum crashed from $4,000 to $3,100. Shortly thereafter, the price surged 34%. If history rhymes, then investors can expect a bottom formation around the current levels and expect Etheruem price to kickstart a rally. ETH Network Growth Hints New Capital Inflow With such a bullish fundamental development in investor outlook, it is likely that Ethereum price could form a bottom here. Supporting this idea are whales or high-net-worth traders accumulating ETH. Whales on Buying Spree Two metrics suggest why whales, also known as high-net-worth investors, are buying ETH. The first indicator is the supply of ETH held by non-exchange addresses, which has risen from roughly 52 million in March 2024 to 66 million as of January 2025. This accumulation spree occurs while the supply of ETH held on exchanges has dropped drastically in the past two months, from 10.89 million on November 27, 2024, to 10.39 million as of July 22, 2025. A combination of these two events serve as a bullish sign that Ethereum price could be preparing for an impulsive move to the upside. ETH Supply on Exchange vs Supply held by non-exchange address Additionally, supporting accumulation is the supply distribution metric that tracks wallets holding between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH. This cohort has increased its stack by 330,000 ETH in the past two weeks. At the current value of No data found for ethereum on 55 minutes ago, they have accumulated ETH worth roughly $1.08 billion. During a crash in July 2024, these wallets accumulated 620K ETH, which led to a price rally from roughly $2,400 to nearly $4,000 in the next five months. During the recent drop, these same wallets have accumulated 330K ETH, which hints that a potential uptrend could be brewing. Whales Accumulate 300K ETH Worth $1 billion in 2 Weeks Will Ethereum Price Visit $4,000? As noted above, on-chain metrics point to a bullish outlook for ETH and expect prices to rally. Technical analysis shows a falling wedge pattern forming for Ethereum on the four-hour chart. The bullish setup forecasts Ethereum price could rally 17% and tag $4,000. This target is obtained by adding the height of the wedge’s widest part to the breakout point of $3,400. ETH/USDT 4-hour chart With bullish on-chain metrics like increased network activity and whales accumulating $1 billion worth of ETH, the outlook is as bullish as it can get. Investors must pay attention to these key support levels: $3,057 and $3,132. A breakdown of these barriers will spell trouble for ETH and could trigger a 13% to 15% crash to $2,657.

From Dogecoin to Shiba Inu, these coins have gained massive attention, attracting millions of investors. But if you missed out on these early opportunities, it’s not too late to cash in on the next big meme coin. Meet BTFD Coin—a new meme coin that’s capturing the attention of early investors with its massive ROI potential. If you slept on Notcoin’s ICO, now’s the time to secure your place in BTFD Coin’s presale, one of the best new meme coin presales to invest in today , before it’s too late. BTFD Coin is already making waves, and the presale numbers show just how much potential this coin has. With a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, staking rewards, and a strong community, BTFD Coin is designed to deliver massive returns. Let’s dive into what makes this coin a must-have for any investor looking to secure their place in the meme coin world. BTFD Coin: Presale Performance, Play-to-Earn, and Staking Rewards BTFD Coin is currently in Stage 14 of its presale, and the numbers are impressive. Over $5.4 million has been raised, and more than 8,900 bulls are already on board, holding over 65 billion BTFD coins. The presale price is currently at $0.0001600, but analysts predict the price could reach $0.006 after it hits the market. This presents a massive opportunity for investors looking for high returns. For example, a $3,000 investment at the current price would give you 18,750,000 BTFD coins. If the price reaches $0.006 post-listing, that investment could grow to $112,500—an ROI of 3,650%! This is why BTFD Coin is considered one of the best new meme coin presales to invest in today. BTFD Coin’s Play-to-Earn game , which launched on January 1, 2025, adds an extra layer of excitement. The game allows users to earn tokens as they play, making it an engaging way to interact with the coin. Plus, with staking rewards of up to 90% APY, BTFD Coin isn’t just about speculation—it’s about long-term gains. Imagine staking your BTFD coins and watching them grow steadily over time. With all these features, it’s easy to see why BTFD Coin is gaining so much attention as one of the best new meme coin presales to invest in today. Moreover, by referring others to join the community, you can earn rewards and help spread the word about BTFD Coin. As more people join the community, the value of the coin could rise, increasing your investment. To buy BTFD Coins, first set up a digital wallet like MetaMask or Trust Wallet and load it with BNB, ETH, or USDT. Then, head to the official BTFD presale page, connect your wallet, and choose how much BTFD you want to buy. After confirming your transaction, your BTFD coins will be added to your wallet, ready for staking or holding until the price increases. Stay updated on your rewards as you grow your investment! Notcoin: A Missed Opportunity Notcoin initially made waves due to its viral Telegram game, which captured the attention of Web3 enthusiasts eager to explore new cryptocurrency projects. The game’s innovative tap-to-earn mechanic quickly drew users into the Notcoin ecosystem, creating a buzz and sparking widespread interest. Many saw Notcoin as the next big thing in the meme coin world, but its ICO has since passed, and the opportunity to invest at its lowest price is no longer available. Despite the hype, Notcoin has already moved past its early days, leaving investors who missed out with a sense of regret.

One of the goals of the ongoing reform is to give the EF a ‘proper board’, but until that happens it’s me,” he said on X. The post came in response to significant backlash against Aya Miyaguchi, the Foundation’s executive director since 2018, with accusations of inefficiencies during her tenure. “If you ‘keep the pressure on,’ then you are creating an environment that is actively toxic to top talent,” Buterin said in response to the social media backlash. No. This is not how this game works. The person deciding the new EF leadership team is me. One of the goals of the ongoing reform is to give the EF a “proper board”, but until that happens it’s me.

However, he emphasized the foundation would not engage in ideological shifts, political lobbying, or take a more central ecosystem role. There is strong community pressure to promote developer Danny Ryan to a leadership position. On Jan. 22, Ryan, who left the EF in 2024 due to health issues, said, “Some of the discourse has turned counterproductive,” before adding: “These are real people attempting to sort through and do what is best. With or without me, the EF is evolving and for the better. You’ve been heard, but vitriol is ultimately harmful to this process.” Just to fill you in: I left the EF last year due to health issues and in an attempt to clear my head after working my ass off exclusively at the EF and on Ethereum for seven years.

Additionally, the dissent and recent EF ETH sales have dampened ETH prices, which have been consolidating for the past month. ETH has gained 2.4% on the day to reach $3,330 at the time of writing, but most of the other altcoins are still outperforming it. The asset failed to follow Bitcoin, XRP, and Solana to existing or new peaks and remains down 32% from its 2021 all-time high. This is all despite US President Donald Trump actively buying ETH and the premise of staked Ethereum ETFs being approved by the SEC soon.

Ethereum could soon outperform Bitcoin. Cryptocurrency analyst explains what the next few months could have in store for Bitcoin. Bitcoin saw a sharp rise followed by a sudden drop after President Trump’s inauguration. His first executive orders made no mention of cryptocurrency or Bitcoin, contrary to expectations from some market watchers. While many had hoped for crypto-friendly policies, Trump’s immediate focus remained on national security and energy reforms. This led some Bitcoin holders to panic-sell, though others believe Bitcoin could still gain recognition as a strategic reserve asset. However, Bitcoin’s dominance still holds strong, and even though the total market cap had some fluctuations, it’s maintaining its position. For now, the signs are still positive for Bitcoin and the broader market, with Ethereum also holding steady.

In addition, the Trump meme coin , which has made headlines following the recent inauguration, experienced a sharp price drop after the lack of crypto-related mentions during the event. Despite this, Trump coin is still holding higher than its launch price, though its future remains uncertain in the short term. Solana and Ethereum are showing signs of bouncing from key support. Ethereum Holds Above Key Support Ethereum has shown mixed price action in recent days, currently holding above the previous swing lows around $3,140, but still below the recent swing highs near $3,450. As the market moves within this range, the outlook remains uncertain, with the potential for further testing of support levels. The analysis suggests that if Ethereum stays above key support around $3,140, there is still room for price continuation. However, the price action remains choppy, and the market could test the support level at $3,334, which represents the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement of the recent price movement. If this level holds, a rebound and further price movement higher could be expected. For a more bullish scenario, the market would need to break above the $3,450 level, which would suggest a move towards higher price levels. If this happens, the next target is the 138% Fibonacci extension at $3,976, followed by potential further gains towards $4,140. However, this forecast remains subject to change, depending on how the market behaves in the coming days. Market Outlook The focus remains on the micro support area, with traders awaiting confirmation of either a continued upward trend or further testing of lower support levels. The market’s reaction to these levels will dictate whether Ethereum can continue its upward momentum or face another correction.",News|Crypto news|Ethereum|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,TRADING|ETH|MARKET|BTC|SOL,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-22 07:22:54

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/economist-says-xrp-is-preparing-for-another-monstrous-move-heres-why/,"Cryptocurrency analyst Mikybull recently shared a technical analysis of XRP, suggesting the potential for a major price movement. The four-hour chart shows a continuation pattern forming after a sharp bullish breakout, with XRP trading at $3.1999, down 2.16% at the time of the post. Bullish Technical Indicators Suggest Optimism Mikybull’s chart highlights key technical signals that support the possibility of further upward movement. XRP previously broke out of a descending wedge pattern, a well-known bullish reversal structure. Following the breakout, the asset surged significantly, forming a steep ascending trendline. Currently, the price is consolidating within a smaller descending channel, often interpreted as a “bull flag.” This pattern, if confirmed by a breakout above the channel’s resistance, could signal the continuation of the prior uptrend. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 57.12 indicates a neutral-to-bullish momentum. The RSI has not entered overbought territory, suggesting room for further upward movement if buying pressure increases. $XRP preparing for another monstrous move pic.twitter.com/JQfp6rWnBu — Mikybull Crypto (@MikybullCrypto) January 19, 2025 Community Reactions Highlight Mixed Sentiment The post quickly drew attention on social media, sparking mixed reactions from the community. A user named RealCornPop echoed Mikybull’s optimism, stating, “$XRP preparing for another monstrous move.” However, others were more critical. Jon Rambo commented, “Monstrous? Example: Trump coin $60 in 1 day. XRP $3 in 7 years. Market decided already!” This divide reflects broader sentiment in the cryptocurrency space. XRP has a strong base of supporters who believe in its long-term potential. It also faces criticism for its relatively slow growth compared to other cryptocurrencies that have experienced meteoric rises in shorter timeframes. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Key Levels and Market Factors to Watch For XRP to fulfill its bullish potential , the price must break above the bull flag’s resistance. Such a move could pave the way for further gains, possibly toward new local highs. However, failure to break out could result in continued consolidation or retracement, depending on market sentiment. External factors, such as overall cryptocurrency market trends, macroeconomic conditions, and developments in XRP’s utility within the payments sector, will also play a crucial role in determining its price trajectory. While Mikybull’s analysis suggests a promising setup for XRP, market uncertainty remains a key factor.

Here’s How,https://coinpedia.org/news/did-donald-trump-fuel-stargate-finance-stg-tokens-rally-heres-how/,"The post Did Donald Trump Fuel Stargate Finance (STG) Token’s Rally? Here’s How appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As the Donald Trump administration settles down for a thrilling task ahead of making America great again, the altcoin market has gradually gained bullish momentum. Under the Trump administration, the cryptocurrency industry has massively been legalized, especially memecoins and DeFi tokens. Moreover, the previous Joe Biden administration heavily recognized Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) as commodities, while the rest of the digital assets were classified as securities. Consequently, more investors, led by institutional investors, have been preparing to wholly endorse the cryptocurrency industry in the near term as a hedge against inflation. Top DeFi Token to Consider Ahead Following the sustained Bitcoin price close above $100k in the recent past, the Stargate Finance (STG) token has signaled the onset of its macro bullish sentiment. The small-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $378 million and a 24-hour average trading volume, surged over 13 percent to trade about $0.378 on Wednesday, during the mid-London session. From a technical analysis standpoint, STG price, in the daily time frame, has consistently closed above the 50 Moving Average (MA) in the last few months, potentially signaling the buyers are in control. Since November 2024, STG price has formed a rising trend, characterized by higher highs and higher lows. In the long haul, if the STG token consistently closes above 55 cents, the next phase of the macro bull run will be confirmed. Bullish Factors in Stargate Finance Stargate Finance has grown to a major omni-protocol, with over $436 million in total value locked (TVL). The highly liquid STG token, with over 38k on-chain holders, has gained massive utility through the Stargate Farm program, whereby liquidity providers get rewarded. The Stargate Finance protocol has gained significant utility as Ethereum’s layer two scaling solutions attract more mainstream users. Moreover, the Stargate Finance platform enables users to seamlessly transfer assets between different chains securely for a small fee.",News|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-22 07:29:28

Revealed on Jan. 21, the platform aims to strengthen Crypto.com’s presence in the U.S. by offering advanced solutions tailored for institutional trading. It will operate as a complementary service to the existing Crypto.com App, which caters to retail traders in the country. According to Crypto.com co-founder and CEO Kris Marszalek, the launch builds on the company’s significant investments in technological capabilities and banking infrastructure since testing an early version of the exchange in 2022. As part of its offerings, institutional traders on the new platform will have access to over 300 cryptocurrencies and 480 trading pairs alongside advanced trading tools, deep liquidity, and infrastructure designed to support high-frequency and large-volume trading, the announcement stated. Further, the platform introduces advanced order types and sub-account options for active traders, while less frequent traders can leverage built-in trading bots like DCA, GRID, and TWAP for automated strategies.

The platform also supports instant transfers, OTC services, and low-latency trading through API integrations and client-focused programs. Crypto.com’s expansion into the institutional market comes as regulatory developments in the U.S. signal a shift toward greater clarity for the cryptocurrency sector under a pro-crypto administration led by President Donald Trump. Since Trump’s election victory, the company has made moves to strengthen its U.S. presence. In December, Crypto.com expanded its footprint in the U.S. by launching the Crypto.com Custody Trust Company, offering custodial services to institutions and high-net-worth clients across the U.S. This move came just days after Crypto.com Marszalek met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, where they discussed crypto-friendly policies, including a proposed national Bitcoin reserve. Subsequently, Crypto.com also withdrew its lawsuit against the SEC, which had challenged the agency’s jurisdiction over certain digital assets. Earlier this month, the exchange introduced stock and ETF trading on its platform for select U.S. users. Following Trump’s inauguration, the Securities and Exchange Commission, led by Acting Chair Mark Uyeda, has moved quickly to address crypto oversight. On Jan. 21, the SEC announced the formation of a dedicated crypto task force with the goal of “developing a comprehensive and clear regulatory framework” for crypto assets.

Ripple investors may benefit if the SEC case is dismissed by SEC leadership. SEC’s appeal could face setbacks, possibly leading to further legal delays. The ongoing legal dispute between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has kept many investors on edge. Legal expert John Deaton recently weighed in, offering insights into what might happen next in this high-profile case. With the SEC filing an appeal, many are left wondering if this could result in a prolonged battle or a swift resolution in favor of Ripple. No Solid Grounds for SEC Appeal Deaton, speaking on the Good Morning Crypto Show, stated that the SEC has little chance of winning an appeal. He thinks the SEC’s appeal is weak, especially because of the recent court decision. In the original ruling, Judge Analisa Torres found that the SEC failed to meet key criteria in its attempt to classify XRP sales to retail investors as unregistered securities. The SEC wants to change this ruling, but Deaton says the case would probably go back to Judge Torres, who may rule in Ripple’s favor again.

While Cardano (ADA), 1Fuel (OTF) , and Bitcoin (BTC) have demonstrated impressive performance in recent times, the question remains: which of these top altcoins is the best crypto coin to buy that can pull in the most returns on a $5,000 investment this year. This article will shed light on recent developments that will answer the question. Cardano hints at rally to $7: Top altcoins making waves Cardano’s ADA has been on a roller coaster since the start of this month, underperforming contemporaries like Bitcoin and Solana. However, crypto expert Big Mike has brought glad tidings to the Cardano community, projecting ADA’s imminent ascent to $7 in an X post on January 18. Big Mike substantiated his projection using the Elliot Wave Theory, an analytic principle that identifies extremes in price levels to forecast future trends. According to the analyst, ADA is in the third wave, gearing up for a surge to $3. After hitting the $3 target, Mike expects a pullback and another surge to $7 eventually. Meanwhile, the Cardano coin is 614% shy of Big Mike’s target from its current price of $0.98 . According to the analyst’s projection, a $5,000 investment in ADA will yield $30,700 in gains.

Expert claims bitcoin is venturing into second price discovery uptrend The now-seated US President Donald Trump stunned the crypto community on January 17, 2025, when he launched a meme coin in his name, TRUMP. This launch triggered a surge in the prices of assets like Solana and Bitcoin, with the latter reclaiming the $100,000 level again. However, on January 20, the flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, reached an all-time high of $109,588 as anticipation of Trump’s inauguration speech mounted. Analysts like Daan Crypto commented on BTC’s behaviour, acknowledging its positive start to the week and asserting it would be a good week for the market. Altcoin Sherpa, another well-known expert, opined that BTC could form a God candle on its chart if Trump announces a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Meanwhile, Rekt Capital asserted that the first price discovery correction is over, and a second price discovery uptrend may be underway, which could send BTC to $150,000 this year. Although Bitcoin has slid from its all-time high to $101,402, it still maintains a 6.80% weekly gain . Compared to Bitcoin’s 48% target, which would turn a $5,000 investment into $7,400, 1Fuel hints at a 100X profit for investors. OTF signals a possible 100X profit for investors post-launch: Best crypto coin to buy? The OTF public presale is underway and moving at an extremely fast pace.

""I don't know much about it other than when I launched it. I heard it was successful,” Trump said in a press conference on Tuesday when asked by a reporter. “Where is it today? Several billion? “That's peanuts for these guys,” he added, referring to the networth of other businessmen in the room that included SoftBank's Masayoshi Son, OpenAI's Sam Altman and Oracle's Larry Ellison. Token prices zoomed 25% in the past 24 hours, beating gains in bitcoin (BTC) and other majors, to reverse losses from earlier in the week. It sits at an $8 billion market capitalization as of Wednesday morning, up nearly 900% since going live. Trump also unveiled a $500 billion joint venture termed Stargate at the event, which aims to build data centers in Texas and would invest in AI infrastructure. Meanwhile, some see TRUMP as a bet on the Republican’s popularity and policies in his term, with ripple effects on how it may shape up Web3 and memecoin markets. “Longer term, TRUMP coin could act as a barometer for public sentiment towards Trump’s presidency,” Yat Siu, co-founder and executive chairman of Animoca Brands told CoinDesk in a message. “Culture memes and tokens are essentially a highly variable public polymarket of culture and zeitgeist, and we’ve seen this play out accordingly.” “(However) If the initiative is perceived as a cash grab without further engagement, we may well see a crypto chill for meme tokens, potentially draining attention and liquidity out of the meme space. How the TRUMP token is handled is likely to have a ripple effect on trust and reputation for the entire crypto and Web3 industry,” Siu added.",Markets,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-22 07:45:21

Recent burn data indicated that over 3 million tokens were taken out of the meme coin’s circulating supply. As an upshot, crypto enthusiasts expect a massive SHIB breakout ahead, driven by supply reduction and the community’s recent advancements. Shiba Inu Burn Rate Blows Over 600% Echoing Bullish Market Sentiments According to the latest data by Shibburn , the Shiba Inu burn rate shot up nearly 613% on January 22, dealing a massive blow to the circulating supply. Per the data, the massive burn rate surge came against the backdrop of 3.24 million tokens sent to a null address, thus permanently removing them from the supply. For context, the SHIB burn mechanism is designed to reduce the crypto’s market supply, which many believe to be the reason behind the dog-themed meme coin’s broader sluggish performance. Thereby, with the abovementioned burn rate surge weighing in, traders and investors anticipate price gains for the crypto asset in light of the law of supply and demand. Community Developments Add To Market Optimism Further, a stockpile of ecosystem developments in recent days appears to have additionally bolstered the market sentiment for Shiba Inu amid its burn rate surge. CoinGape reported that SHIB lead developer Shytoshi Kusama stated a “big week” lies ahead for the meme token. This statement has sparked market-wide speculations of a looming advancement for the coin’s community. Moreover, with American billionaire and investor Mark Cuban lauding SHIB’s potential recently, market watchers are extensively eyeing the crypto with bullish long-term views. Particularly in light of the community’s long-term goals and support, Cuban finds the meme coin to be one of the few promising projects in the sector. Overall, the Shiba Inu burn rate surge and these developments have solidified investors’ sentiments of a looming breakout, further driven by the recent pro-crypto Donald Trump frenzy. What’s Next For SHIB? At the time of reporting, SHIB price witnessed a 4% uptick in value, reaching $0.00002054. The coin’s 24-hour low and high were $0.00001983 and $0.00002127, respectively. Notably, the coin rises alongside the intraday Shiba Inu burn rate surge and positive market sentiments building against the backdrop of Trump’s win and meme coin sector recovery. After a waning action yesterday, DOGE, PEPE, and TRUMP, among other meme coins, witnessed a remarkable upswing. In light of this recovery-like trend, crypto enthusiast ‘VipRoseTr’ revealed on X that a $0.00004029 price target is ahead for the asset. Also, a recent Shiba Inu price analysis by CoinGape further cements the chances of a breakout approaching, as the coin showcases the potential to gain 100x this year. Source: Rose Premium Signals, X This bullish prediction comes riding the back of strong market technicals and price patterns, flagging that a potential run to $0.00003340, followed by the March 4 high of $0.0000455, is possible. However, the $0.00001565 support remains extensively eyed by market watchers, given the crypto realm’s dynamic nature.

Ripple’s legal clarity and adoption drive XRP’s climb among global assets. XRP’s $3.18 price reflects strong market momentum and institutional confidence. Ripple’s XRP has achieved a major milestone, surpassing Goldman Sachs to claim the 85th spot among global assets . With a market capitalization now at $191.67 billion, XRP is cementing its place among the Top 3 Cryptos by market value. Key Factors Driving XRP’s Growth Related: Why XRP Is the Market’s Focus After a 25% Jump XRP’s rise to a market capitalization of $191.67 billion, with a trading price of $3.19 at the time of writing, stems from several factors. Ripple’s partial legal win against the SEC has been a turning point, for sure, which provided greater clarity on XRP’s regulatory status. The court’s decision stating XRP is not a security in public transactions, has helped boost investor confidence. The broader cryptocurrency market’s bullish momentum has also played a key role.

Markets were choppy but stabilized after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission unveiled plans to overhaul rules and regulations for the sector. BTC is trading around $105,846 and has registered gains of nearly 10% over the past week. The crypto market has rebounded over the past 24 hours. Ethereum (ETH) rose nearly 3% to reclaim $3,300 and is currently trading around $3,342. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) is up 2.50%, while Solana (SOL) is up nearly 8%, remaining above $250. Dogecoin (DOGE) , Cardano (ADA) , Chainlink (LINK) , Tron (TRX) , Sui (SUI), Polkadot (DOT), and Litecoin (LTC) also registered substantial gains. The TRUMP meme coin is also up nearly 15%, gaining a staggering 530% since launch. SEC Gives Crypto First Win Of Trump Presidency The United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s new leadership has announced the creation of a task force to develop a clear regulatory framework for digital assets. This is the first attempt by the Trump administration to overhaul crypto policy. Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal said the SEC is moving quickly on Trump’s agenda, stating, “The president has moved quickly on his agenda. The SEC has made it clear they understand that and want to be a part of that.” The task force was created by the acting Chair of the SEC, Mark Uyeda. Its primary goal would be to develop a clear and comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto assets. SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce will lead the task force. Pierce has urged the public to collaborate with the SEC to shape the future of crypto. However, she added that the process would require significant time and effort. “This undertaking will take time, patience, and much hard work. It will succeed only if the Task Force has input from a wide range of investors, industry participants, academics, and other interested parties.” The task force was announced a day after former SEC Chair Gary Gensler stepped down, and President Trump nominated Uyeda as acting Chair. Trump has nominated Paul Atkins as the next Chair of the SEC. However, the pick is subject to approval from the US Senate. The SEC released a statement on its website regarding the task force, stating, “Drawing from talented staff across the agency, the Task Force will collaborate with Commission staff and the public to set the SEC on a sensible regulatory path that respects the bounds of the law. To date, the SEC has relied primarily on enforcement actions to regulate crypto retroactively and reactively, often adopting novel and untested legal interpretations along the way. Clarity regarding who must register and practical solutions for those seeking to register have been elusive. The result has been confusion about what is legal, which creates an environment hostile to innovation and conducive to fraud. The SEC can do better.” TRUMP, MELANIA Meme Coins Crash After Inauguration The cryptocurrency market witnessed a sharp pullback on Tuesday following the inauguration of Donald Trump. Despite reaching a new all-time high on Monday, Bitcoin (BTC) registered a dramatic drop, falling to $102,408 before recovering on Tuesday. The sharp decline came after Trump emphasized his plans for imposing trade tariffs, amending immigration policy, and energy deregulation. However, Trump did not make any specific references to crypto. Failure to mention crypto in his inaugural speech has left some market watchers disappointed at a time when expectations from the Trump administration regarding digital assets were sky-high. Matthew Dibb, the Chief Investment Officer at Crypto Asset Manager Astronaut Capital, stated, “I think in the short term there's a chance this could be a sell-the-news event. The market has some great expectations about a Bitcoin strategic reserve and a loosening of regulations around digital assets, but it's more likely these developments will be drip-fed over a series of months rather than days. Bitcoin has already retreated ... We expect further volatility here and likely a selloff.” The Trump administration is expected to introduce several regulatory changes and potentially create a Bitcoin strategic reserve. However, Trump’s involvement in the crypto market has led to ethical concerns and concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has registered a marginal dip during the ongoing session as it struggles to build momentum despite surging to an all-time high on Monday. BTC reached $109,350 on Monday but quickly plummeted to test the $100,000 support, dropping to an intraday low of $99,514 before recovering to settle at $102,408. BTC’s price action suggests that despite a bullish market, sellers are keeping pressure on the $100,000 price boundary. Trump’s inauguration day saw significant price volatility but disappointed many in crypto after the president failed to mention BTC, crypto, or a Bitcoin strategic reserve. As a result of the volatility, longs saw significant liquidations. One analyst on X stated, “I’d take a long from 99.5K~ if offered. I think the gray box needs to hold for local bullishness, and sweeping all the Trump leadup/news PA makes sense. I'd also accept a sweep of the 97K low, but that's the farthest it should go. Any good amount of time spent past 96-97K and my plan / read is likely off. Inval low 90's, aiming for new ATH's.” The Bitcoin price chart suggests considerable choppiness in the market, and we could see a definitive trend emerge by the end of the week. While BTC has maintained an upward trajectory after recovering from last week’s collapse, it has faced increasing volatility over recent sessions. BTC plummeted to an intraday low of $89,397 on Monday as selling pressure peaked. However, it recovered to reclaim $90,000 and ultimately settled at $94,492. Markets recovered on Tuesday, and BTC registered an increase of 2.19%, going past the 20-day SMA and settling at $96,566. Bullish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as BTC crossed the 50-day SMA, registering an increase of 3.61% and settling at $100,051. Sellers returned to the market on Thursday as BTC dropped to an intraday low of $97,094. However, it recovered from this level and settled at $99,798, ultimately registering only a marginal decline. Source: TradingView BTC made a strong recovery on Friday, rising almost 4% to surge past $100,000 and settle at $103,732. However, bearish sentiment and volatility returned over the weekend as BTC plummeted to an intraday low of $101,591 on Saturday before ultimately settling at $103,579. Buyers attempted a recovery on Sunday as BTC surged to an intraday high of $106,552. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and registered a drop of just over 2% to settle at $101,434. BTC rallied to a new all-time high on Monday when it hit $109,350. However, it rapidly declined after reaching this level and settled at $102,408, registering an increase of nearly 1%. Sellers attempted to drive BTC below $100,000 on Tuesday as the price dropped to an intraday low of $100,173. However, buyers bought the dip, allowing the price to recover. As a result, BTC rose 3.56% and ended the day at $106,054. The current session sees BTC marginally down as sellers look to drive the price below $105,000. However, if market sentiment changes and buyers regain control, BTC could see a move past $110,000. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) is trading close to the psychological $3,300 level as it continues to experience volatility, leading to a considerable lack of momentum. ETH’s price struggles come as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin lashed out at growing criticism of Ethereum Foundation executive director Aya Miyaguchi and calls for her to step down from her role. The ongoing tussle between the Ethereum Foundation and the Ethereum community has also had a detrimental impact on ETH, with the asset underperforming compared to BTC, XRP, and SOL over the past weeks. ETH’s price chart shows the asset experiencing significant volatility since recovering from an intraday low of $2,927 on Monday. ETH recovered to reclaim $3,000 and settle at $3,137 before registering an increase of 2.85% on Tuesday and moving to $3,336. Bullish sentiment registered a substantial increase on Wednesday as ETH surged past the 20-day SMA, rising nearly 7% to $3,450. However, buyers lost momentum after reaching this level, and ETH dropped 4.10% on Thursday to slip below the 20-day SMA and settle at $3,308. Buyers returned to the market on Friday, with ETH registering an increase of nearly 5% to move past the 20-day SMA and settle at $3,473. Once again, ETH was back in the red on Saturday, dropping nearly 5% to slip below the 20-day SMA and settle at $3,305. Source: TradingView Sellers retained control on Sunday after thwarting a recovery attempt. As a result, ETH dropped nearly 3% to $3,212. The current week began with ETH experiencing significant volatility as buyers and sellers attempted to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as ETH rallied to an intraday high of $3,446 before settling at $3,280. Buyers retained control on Tuesday, with ETH rising 1.44% to $3,327. However, ETH is struggling to move past the 20-day SMA, which acted as a dynamic resistance level. The current session sees ETH marginally down and trading just above the $3,320 level. If sellers continue to dominate the market, ETH could decline to $3,000. On the other hand, if buyers regain control, ETH could look to move past the 20-day SMA and push towards $3,500. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Like Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL) too surged to a new all-time high on Sunday, driven by the launch of the TRUMP and MELANIA meme tokens created on the Solana blockchain. The success of both meme coins generated considerable interest in SOL as well, helping boost the price. SOL has been bullish since recovering from an intraday low of $169 last Thursday. SOL recovered on Tuesday, rising 2.58% to $187. Bullish sentiment registered a substantial increase on Wednesday as SOL surged past the 20-day SMA and $200 to settle at $205 after rising nearly 10%. Buyers retained control on Thursday as SOL pushed above the 50-day SMA and settled at $211. Friday saw SOL register an increase of 4% and move to $219. Source: TradingView The weekend saw renewed buying activity as SOL surged a staggering 19.19% on Saturday to smash past $250 and settle at $261. Bulls retained control during the first half of Sunday as SOL surged to a new all-time high of $295. However, it could not get beyond this point as buyers lost momentum. As a result, sellers took over, and SOL dropped nearly 4% to $252. Buyers attempted a recovery on Monday as SOL reached an intraday high of $272. However, sellers took control and drove SOL below $250 to $241. The price recovered on Tuesday despite considerable volatility, rising 3.47% to reclaim $250. The current session sees SOL up by 2.31% and trading around $256. Buyers will look to build momentum and push towards $280-$290. Dogwifhat (WIF) Price Analysis Dogwifhat (WIF) has been trading in a downward trajectory since the weekend after failing to move past $2 on Sunday. WIF was quite bullish last week despite starting it on a bearish note. The meme coin recovered from Monday’s low to register an increase of nearly 4% on Tuesday and settle at $1.54. Bullish sentiment registered a substantial increase on Wednesday as WIF rallied a staggering 14% and settled at $1.76. With the 20-day SMA coming into play, WIF lost momentum on Thursday and registered a marginal decline. However, it recovered on Friday, rising 6.14% to move past the 20-day SMA and settle at $1.87. Source: TradingView Buyers attempted a move past $2 on Saturday as WIF reached an intraday high of $1.98. However, WIF lost momentum at this point and dropped over 5% to slip below the 20-day SMA and settle at $1.77. Bullish sentiment intensified on Sunday as WIF dropped nearly 14% to $1.53. The current week began with WIF firmly in the red, dropping over 9% to $1.38. Buyers returned to the market on Tuesday as WIF rose 4.50% to settle at $1.45. The current session sees WIF marginally down, trading around $1.43. Hedera (HBAR) Price Analysis Hedera (HBAR) surged to an intraday high of $0.402 on Friday but has since been trading primarily in the red as selling pressure intensifies. HBAR’s bullish momentum began on Tuesday when it registered a substantial increase of 4.25% to move past the 50-day SMA and settle at $0.287. Buying activity registered a significant increase on Wednesday as HBAR surged past the 50-day SMA and $0.30 to settle at $0.322 after an increase of 12.09%. Bullish sentiment persisted on Thursday as HBAR surged over 12% and moved to $0.361. The price reached an intraday high of $0.402 on Friday. However, buyers lost momentum at this point, and the price dropped to $0.373, an increase of 3.23%. Source: TradingView HBAR turned bearish over the weekend, dropping nearly 5% on Saturday and settling at $0.355. Bearish sentiment intensified on Sunday, with the price dropping 8.48% to $0.324. Buyers returned to the market on Monday as HBAR rose to an intraday high of $0.373. However, it could not go higher and ultimately settled at $0.342, registering an increase of 5.32%. HBAR registered a marginal decline on Tuesday, dropping nearly 3% during the ongoing session and trading around $0.327. Stellar (XLM) Price Analysis Stellar (XLM) surged past the 50-day SMA last Wednesday after registering a staggering rise of nearly 14% and moving to $0.488. Buyers pushed the price to an intraday high of $0.514 on Thursday. However, XLM lost momentum after reaching this level and dropped 1.28% to $0.482, but not before falling to an intraday low of $0.464. Buyers returned to the market on Friday as XLM rose 1.24% to $0.488. XLM dropped to an intraday low of $0.451 on Saturday as sellers attempted to drive the price below $0.45.

Source: TradingView Selling pressure returned on Sunday as the price plummeted over 11%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $0.433. The current week began with XLM rising to an intraday high of $0.477. However, the price could not push higher and ultimately settled at $0.445, registering an increase of nearly 3%.

Crypto could revamp the finance industry Johnson then discussed the potential for blockchain technology to revamp the financial industry as well as address challenges that have gone unnoticed for several years. She went on to predict that ETFs (exchange-traded funds) and mutual funds will “ultimately” be the next big products that will be built on top of distributed ledger technology. “I do think that it’s likely that ETFs and mutual funds will ultimately be built on blockchain just because it’s an incredibly efficient technology”. Johnson calls for crypto clarity under Trump In order for blockchain and crypto to address issues in the TradFi sector, Johnson stressed that a clear regulatory framework first needs to be developed to facilitate integration of the crypto and traditional finance sectors, saying, “We need to have some sort of regulatory clarity so that you could bring these together because, fundamentally, it will drive out costs.” She added that there is “great innovation that the technology enables”. The new Trump administration, which took office on Jan. 20, has yet to address crypto-related policies and regulatory challenges. Throughout his political campaigns, Trump predicted a sustainable and secure future for digital assets. This is the main reason analysts and crypto experts expect the President to review the current crypto regulatory framework in the US and propose initiatives that favor both the digital asset and financial sectors. Although Johnson is positive about the long-term potential of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, she compared the technologies to the late 1990s and early 2000s dot-com boom. “It’ll be a little bit like the dot-com era, eventually, you had some of the biggest companies of the next decade that came out of it, and then you had a lot that kind of blew away to the side. I think that the crypto world is similar,” Johnson added. The dot-com bubble peaked at $2.95 trillion in 2000 and eventually burst when speculative investments dried up. Despite the slump, companies such as Amazon and Google have emerged as digital economy leaders. Industry analysts believe that the current US government could become the most pro-crypto in history, especially under Trump. With a strong belief in innovation and a legal environment designed to encourage responsible growth, the convergence of crypto and TradFI has the potential to reshape the global financial world.

On Jan. 21, Critical Metals Corp, the first Nasdaq-listed mining company to announce such a move, revealed that its Board of Directors had approved a Bitcoin ( BTC ) treasury strategy. The company plans to hold Bitcoin as a primary asset in its treasury , treating it as a key asset in its treasury management strategy. Critical Metals Corp just became the first Nasdaq-listed critical minerals company to make Bitcoin its primary treasury reserve asset. They already have access to $100mm to buy bitcoin and could acquire up to $400mm more via a convertible debt raise. (s/o @Mason_Jappa ) pic.twitter.com/rVp2gp78sa — Sam Callahan (@samcallah) January 21, 2025 The strategy is supported by a financing agreement with JBA Asset Management, which allows Critical Metals Corp. access to up to $500 million to acquire Bitcoin. The first $100 million tranche is available for BTC purchases, subject to certain undisclosed conditions. The first $100 million comes with 100% warrant coverage. Simply put, this means that investors who put in money will have the right to buy extra shares of the company in the future, equal to the full amount they invested, at a fixed price. For the remaining $400 million, which is optional and could be accessed later, the coverage is 50%. This means that for every dollar invested, the investor can buy extra shares worth half the value of their investment, at a fixed price. The notes issued in the financing will be secured by the cash raised, and any BTC purchased under the program are convertible into the company’s common stock at a price of $6.00 per share, with warrants associated with the conversion at the cost of $7.00 per share.

Let’s Dive In To Find Out How & Why",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/which-of-these-will-make-you-rich-in-2025-cardano-ada-ripple-or-remittix-lets-dive-in-to-find-out-how-why/,"Many traders believe Cardano (ADA), Ripple (XRP), and Remittix (RTX) could be the top crypto investments of 2025 for those seeking major gains. While Cardano, Ripple, and Remittix each aim to offer unique advantages, only time will tell which token truly stands out. Some view these as high-growth altcoins, while others call them the best blockchain projects to watch. Below, we explore how Cardano, Ripple, and Remittix compare in today’s market. Cardano: A Key Player in the Market Launched by Charles Hoskinson, Cardano focuses on scalable, secure solutions. Currently priced around $1.04, it saw a -7.63% dip in the last day but remains up +2.54% this week and +8.74% over the past month. Many see Cardano (ADA) as one of the top crypto investments of 2025 because it supports future DeFi contenders through its advanced smart contracts. Some investors also compare its proof-of-stake model to newer projects like Remittix, which seeks to solve everyday finance issues. Despite recent market fluctuations, Cardano continues to attract developers. People call it the best blockchain project to watch for its long-term plans in DeFi. Staking on Cardano (ADA) can provide rewards, boosting user engagement. Critics say progress is sometimes slow, but fans argue quality upgrades take time. In contrast, tokens like Remittix move quickly to fix payment problems. Still, many Cardano backers believe it will keep climbing if it meets its roadmap goals. Ripple: A Force to Be Reckoned With Founded to revolutionize global payments, Ripple has made headlines, especially after recent legal updates. Priced near $3.06, Ripple (XRP) dropped -5.93% on the last day but still jumped +20.86% this week and +36.75% over the past month. This kind of growth leads some to call Ripple one of the top crypto investments 2025. By partnering with banks and payment providers, Ripple aims to reduce transaction costs worldwide, a goal somewhat shared by Remittix. Though lawsuits have caused uncertainty, many see Ripple rebounding if regulatory barriers ease. Large-scale deals also boost adoption for Ripple (XRP), proving it has real-world use. Still, new projects like Remittix could pose competition if they manage to solve remittance issues faster. While Ripple remains a major player, the crypto world is always evolving—tokens like Remittix can quickly catch up if they address pressing needs. Remittix: The Best to Outperform Unlike Cardano or Ripple, which both have been around for years, Remittix is a fresh token focusing on speedy cross-border transfers. Priced around $0.0256, Remittix (RTX) has already risen 125% since its early presale. Some investors call it one of the top crypto investments of 2025 due to its practical PayFi model, letting people convert digital funds to local money in under 24 hours. This direct approach gives Remittix an edge in the real world, where users want quick, affordable transactions. Early data shows Remittix raising millions in a short time, suggesting strong market interest. Unlike tokens that rely on hype, Remittix (RTX) targets actual remittance problems—such as high fees and long waiting times. If mainstream adoption continues, Remittix might outshine Cardano and Ripple. That’s why some see it as more than just a newcomer. Backers believe Remittix has the potential to offer greater returns, especially if its cross-border services become widely used. Conclusion Each of these coins—Cardano, Ripple, and Remittix—has a distinct advantage. Cardano (ADA) keeps advancing its blockchain tech, Ripple (XRP) maintains strong ties to financial institutions, and Remittix (RTX) focuses on speedy everyday payments. While no investment is guaranteed, many experts feel Remittix could see faster real-world growth by solving problems that affect millions of users right now. For anyone watching the top crypto investments 2025, all three deserve attention, but Remittix may well outperform the rest in the coming years.

This acquisition marks the company’s 11th consecutive week of Bitcoin purchases, reinforcing its status as a significant player in the digital currency space. Saylor has been at the forefront of this strategy, positioning the enterprise software company as a leveraged Bitcoin proxy. MicroStrategy Bitcoin Holdings Surge According to Microstrategy’s filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the firm acquired the Bitcoin at an average price of about $101,191 per token between January 13 and January 20. With this latest purchase, the firm now holds over 2% of all Bitcoin that will ever be mined, representing approximately $47.9 billion in total Bitcoin holdings. MicroStrategy has been funding these acquisitions through a combination of at-the-market stock sales and convertible debt offerings. Related Reading: Bitcoin Struggles For Direction Post-Trump Disappointment – What Next? The timing of this latest purchase aligns with a broader shift in the regulatory environment under President Donald Trump, who has transitioned from being a crypto skeptic to a supporter of the industry. This change is expected to create a more favorable regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, prompting Saylor and MicroStrategy to accelerate their capital goals and Bitcoin buying efforts. Ahead of Trump’s inauguration, the firm’s co-founder even attended the first ever “Crypto Ball” in Washington on Friday, where he engaged with key figures in the incoming administration. New Shares To Support BTC Strategy In a related development, MicroStrategy shareholders voted also on Tuesday to approve a staggering 30-fold increase in the number of authorized Class A common shares, raising it from 330 million to 10.3 billion. According to a Bloomberg report, this decision, which passed with around 56% of the vote, is designed to facilitate further financing for the company’s Bitcoin purchases. Additionally, shareholders voted to increase the authorized shares of preferred stock from 5 million to 1 billion. Related Reading: Is It Time To Give Up On Ethereum Below $4,000? Analyst Weighs The Facts These amendments will take effect once MicroStrategy files the necessary certificate of amendment with the Delaware Secretary of State. The report notes that with Chairman Saylor holding about 47% of the voting power, the outcome was largely anticipated. The newly authorized shares will also be utilized for various financial strategies, including private transactions of Class A stock, sales of at-the-market equity offerings, and settling redemptions or conversions of convertible notes. However, the company has indicated that it may choose not to sell all of the additional shares. At the time of writing, Bitcoin continues to experience significant price volatility, with its price hinting at a new record high. It is currently trading at $106,400, representing a 2.5% increase in the 24-hour time frame.

Starting with the wider crypto market, Zeberg tells his 174,400 followers on the social media platform X that the total market cap of crypto assets could increase by approximately 141% from the current level. “I think it will reach a size of approximately $9 trillion before the top! Insane Bubble – but let’s ride it.” The total crypto market is at $3.73 trillion at time of writing. Based on Zeberg’s chart, it appears he’s suggesting that the total crypto market cap is in a rising wedge pattern on the weekly time frame. It also appears that the economist is suggesting that the total crypto market cap is in the final wave of a five-wave pattern that started in 2018. According to the Elliott Wave theory, the main trend of the price of an asset moves in a five-wave pattern while a correction occurs in a three-wave pattern. Source: Henrik Zeberg/X Turning to memecoins, Zeberg says that despite “sucking liquidity” from other crypto assets, the official Donald Trump meme Official Trump ( TRUMP ) could be a blessing in disguise for the market. “This [TRUMP memecoin] may seem as a bad thing for crypto – but in fact this may well be the dynamics which unleashes the full crypto-mania. Like water on a beach pulling away – only to come back as a tsunami. Some Memes have been crushed the last few days/weeks. I think they put in major and massive bottoms.” One of the memecoins that Zeberg is bullish on is dogwifhat ( WIF ). Earlier this month, Zeberg predicted that WIF could rally by up to 1,238% from the current level. “WIF is about to explode higher in larger wave 3 – in an extended move which may reach as high as 18-19 USD in this next move!” WIF is trading at $1.42 at time of writing.

As a result, memecoins such as Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Trump coin, and Bonk have recorded the highest gains during this period. Successively, market players have been keen on icebreaker questions like: Will the memecoin segment maintain its bullish recovery and surpass its important resistance levels this week? Or is this another minor pump before the dump? In this article, CoinPedia’s expert panel has uncovered the market sentiment and possible price analysis of the top 3 memecoins by market cap. Dogecoin (DOGE) The Doge coin price has maintained its positive action by adding 8.26% in 24 hours and 17.79% over the last 30 days. Notably, with a YTD return of +16.16%, it has secured the 07th position with a market capitalization of $54.185 billion. TradingView: DOGE/USDT The Simple Moving Average (SMA) is on the verge of experiencing a bearish convergence in the DOGE price chart. Moreover, the MACD indicator records a similar price action in the daily time frame. However, considering the present market sentiments, a positive reversal cannot be ignored. Suppose, a bullish reversal occurs, under such a situation, the Dogecoin price will retest its upper high of $0.440 in the coming time. On the contrary, if the bears outrun the bulls, this could result in it plunging toward its low of $0.325. Wondering if DOGE memecoin will reach $3? Read CoinPedia’s Dogecoin Price Prediction to uncover the possible long-term mysteries! Shiba Inu (SHIB) Despite recording a bearish action this year, the SHIB coin price has jumped ~4% today with a trading volume of over $600 million. This meme coin has a Year-to-Date (YTD) return of -2.67% and has secured a market valuation of $12.124 billion. TradingView: SHIB/USDT The Relative Strength Index (RSI) records a bearish curve in the daily time frame. Moreover, the EMA 50/200-day shows a similar price action. This suggests a negative outlook for the second-largest meme coin by market cap. If the bulls regain momentum, the Shiba Inu price will breach its resistance level of $0.00002350 and head toward its upper resistance level of $0.00003080. However, a bearish reversal could pull the price of this meme coin toward its low of $0.000170. Are you planning on stacking the SHIB memecoins before they strike off a “0?” Read our Shiba Inu Price Prediction ! Bonk (BONK) With a jump of over 15% in 24 hours, the Bonk price has outperformed top cryptocurrencies. Reportedly, this Solana-based memecoin reclaimed a position among the top 50 cryptocurrencies with a market cap of over $2.51 billion. TradingView: BONK/USDT The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows a constant rise in the green histogram, with its averages recording an upward trajectory. Further, the SMA indicator supports the Bonk price chart in the daily time frame, suggesting a positive outlook. Maintaining a bullish price action could push the price of Bonk toward its upper resistance level of $0.00004050 this month. Conversely, a trend reversal could pull the price toward its low of $0.0000270. Curious to find out if Bonk memecoin will hit a new 52-week high this 2025?

Notably, the recent jump in DOGE value could be attributed to several factors including whale activity, growing institutional focus, and other related factors. Besides, Elon Musk has also refuted concerns over the recent lawsuits against Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.), which has further bolstered market sentiment. Elon Musk Refutes DOGE Lawsuit Concerns The Dogecoin price jump can be attributed to several factors, including Elon Musk’s reassurance regarding the lawsuits against the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.). Musk’s comments have bolstered market sentiment, potentially driving the meme coin’s price higher. The D.O.G.E. faced legal challenges just after Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20, with a US watchdog group alleging violations of federal transparency laws. Interestingly, the DOGE price also took a hit just after the development as investors grew concerned. However, recent comments from Elon Musk appear to have relieved the investors, while potentially pushing the meme coin’s price higher. For context, Elon Musk has recently shared an update on X which showed that DOGE has faced three lawsuits. Sharing the update, the tech mogul jokingly said: “Can someone start a lawsuit counter? How long until we hit triple digits?” Besides, Musk also recently said that “We’re going to take DOGE To Mars”, which has fueled investors’ confidence. Although, the remark was not directly related to Dogecoin, Musk’s previous backing for the meme coin has fueled speculations. Meanwhile, here we discuss several other catalysts that might have fueled the recent rally of the meme coin. Why Is Dogecoin Price Rising Today? Bullish Crypto Market Sentiment The broader crypto market recorded a strong rally today, indicating a bullish sentiment hovering in the market. Notably, as of writing, the global crypto market cap soared 3.5% to $3.63 trillion, with most of the top altcoins noting significant gains. Bitcoin price was up around 3.2% and exchanged hands at $105.5K, while altcoins like Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and others, also recorded a robust surge. The meme coins segment also showed a similar performance, indicating the growing confidence of the investors towards the risk-bet assets. DOGE Whale Buying The Dogecoin whales are also on a buying spree, which has supported the recent rally of the meme coin. In a recent X post, popular market expert Ali Martinez said that the whales or large investors had purchased around 590 million DOGE recently, indicating strong confidence of the traders. Source: Ali Martinez, X Meanwhile, this report contradicts the previous sentiment that whales had offloaded their holdings after the lawsuit. For context, a DOGE whale has recently dumped $140 million in Dogecoin, which has sparked concerns over a potential end to the meme coin frenzy. Dogecoin Price Soars Amid ETF Filings The recent ETF filings for the meme coin have further bolstered market sentiment. Recently, REX Shares, in collaboration with Osprey, has filed S-1 filings with the US SEC to launch a flurry of crypto ETFs. According to recent reports, the asset manager has filed for XRP, SOL, BONK, and DOGE ETFs with the regulators. Besides, it also included an application to offer the newly launched meme coin, TRUMP ETF to institutional investors, which showcases the soaring confidence towards the meme coins space. D.O.G.E. Featuring Dogecoin Logo Donald Trump has recently signed an order to launch the Department of Government Efficiency, which has sparked market optimism. Notably, the acronym of the department resembles with Dogecoin ticker. As a result, the developments of the department often influence the Dogecoin price. Having said that, the official website of D.O.G.E. featuring a Dogecoin logo has fueled market sentiment recently. It appears that this inclusion of the image has further cemented bets over a potential DOGE rally ahead. Dogecoin Price To Hit $0.5? DOGE price today surged 8.02% during writing and traded at $0.37 with its one-day trading volume jumping 17% to $8.46 billion. Notably, the crypto has touched a 24-hour high of $0.4, indicating strong market confidence. Besides, CoinGlass data showed that DOGE Futures Open Interest rose 6% to $4.96 billion, reflecting the bullish market sentiment. Amid this, market analyst Ali Martinez has shared a bullish forecast for the meme coin. According to Martinez, Dogecoin price is maintaining its position above “the breakout zone” and showing resilience. Having said that, he predicted a potential rally for the crypto ahead to $0.5. Source: Ali Martinez, X Echoing a similar sentiment, another market expert Rose Premium Signals also shared a bullish prediction. In a recent X post, the analyst has set three targets to watch for the Dogecoin price. According to the expert, Dogecoin price is gearing up for a strong rally and will hit $0.48 first, before a potential breakout to $0.57 and $0.66.

However, a very minimal impact has been seen on the token’s value, which suggests that external factors do not influence the trend. Besides, the emergence of new ‘Celebrity Coins’ like TRUMP, MELANIA, etc. has absorbed more than half of the total trading volume, which could have refrained the token from manifesting the required strength. Despite the rise of new tokens, the market participants remain bullish over primitive tokens like XRP, ADA, DOGE, LINK, etc., and a few more hints towards unexplored bullish divergences within these altcoins. Meanwhile, the XRP price, which is strongly advancing towards a $200 billion market capitalisation target, is believed to revamp a strong ascending trend soon. With this, the possibility of a new ATH remains elevated before the end of the month. The short-term price action of XRP displays an excessive contraction in the past few hours, which has prevented the token from massive bullish action. The bearish dominance appears to have superseded the bulls, which has restricted the rally within a descending, expanding channel. Besides, the stochastic RSI is failing to rise above the average range, which may keep the Bollinger bands within a parallel range. Therefore, the XRP price may continue to trade within the range for a while or until it reaches the apex, followed by a breakout beyond the range. This move could push the price towards the upper channel of Bollinger, while the breakout from this range could require a huge amount of buying liquidity. Currently, the volume has been rerouted to the other new tokens, which have also begun to plunge. Hence, in the coming days, this liquidity is expected to enter back into the primitive tokens, as more than 90% of traders are bullish about the XRP price rally. Hence, the price is believed to trigger a strong rise and mark fresh highs shortly.",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|MARKET|ADA|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-22 08:07:53

Many AI enthusiasts have termed the move as a turning point in the US’ journey to become a global leader in AI. Interestingly, at the time when the AI community is discussing the favourable environment created by the withdrawal of Biden’s EO on AI, OpenAI and SoftBank have jointly announced an ambitious AI infrastructure project, named Stargate. How does the project aim to reshape the US AI Infrastructure? And, how will this impact the AI crypto sector? Let’s examine! Stargate: Everything You Should Know Stargate, introduced by OpenAI and SoftBank, aims to strengthen the nation’s capability to train and run new AI models. According to reports, in the first stage, at least $100 billion will be invested. Reports also highlight that the total investment of the project may increase to as high as $500 billion in the next four years. Reports reveal that the first initiative of the project will be to build a data centre project in Abilene, Texas. Sources suggest that the Abilene data centre project has already begun. Trump Praises Stargate’s Impact US President Donald Trump has welcomed the announcement made by SoftBank and OpenAI, terming it as a ‘declaration of confidence in America.’ Explaining how this project will benefit the workforce of the US, he has mentioned the potential of the project to create at least 100,000 jobs in the near future. Stargate Leadership and Technology Partners As per reports, SoftBank chair Masayoshi Son will chair the project. Reports add that the financial responsibility of the project will be handled by SoftBank and the operational responsibility by OpenAI. Sources reveal that many conglomerates like Oracle, MicoSoft, Nvidia, Arm and MGX fund may join the project as its partners. Stargate’s Impact on AI Tokens The favorable developments that have occurred in the AI sector after Trump’s inauguration have positively impacted the AI token segment. In the last 24 hours alone, the AI token segment has seen a rise of 8.9%. Almost all the top ten AI tokens have experienced growth during the period. NEAR Protocol has surged by 5.9%, Internet Computer by 2.4%, Render by 8.4%, Bittensor by 10.8%, Artificial Superintelligence Alliance by 14.4%, Virtuals Protocols by 19%, The Graph by 4.5%, Arweave by 7.7%, and Akash Network by 9.0%. Importantly, the price of ai16z has witnessed a massive increase of 41,2% in the last 24 hours. Apart from that the share price of SoftBank Group Corp has climbed by 10.51% in the last 24 hours. In conclusion, the Stargate project represents a bold step toward making the US a global AI leader. Considering the impact the latest developments have made in the AI token segment, the project may benefit the overall crypto sector, particularly AI tokens, immensely in future.",News|Altcoins|Artificial Intelligence,EN,0,0,MARKET|NEAR|AKT|ALTCOIN|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-22 08:10:56

According to a Jan. 21 announcement, jAssets will allow users to mint their own synthetic asset tokens that would approximately track the value of traditional assets. The value of those tokens would be tied to real-world assets like stocks, commodities and precious metals. Jellyverse moved ahead with the implementation of the new feature following a proposal seeing a positive outcome in an integration vote by the protocol’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO.) Minting jAssets by locking up crypto as collateral allows for on-chain portfolio diversification. Benedikt Keck, co-founder at Jellyverse developer Blkswn, explained that the new product will allow for “portfolio diversification in DeFi by offering a range of innovative investment strategies, including long, short, and leveraged positions.” The new synthetic assets protocol also allows for multi-collateral troves, with support for “wETH, wBTC, JLY, SEI, USDC, USDT, FRAX or GEM or a combination of these assets as collateral,” he explained. Jellyverse relies on decentralized oracles and over-collateralization to ensure that the value of the collateral exceeds the synthetic assets and prevent the protocol from losing assets. The oracles in question are based on Pyth Network (PYTH). A blockchain oracle is a tool or service that feeds external, real-world data into a blockchain so smart contracts can act on it. Usually, data that is external to blockchains cannot be accessed in the smart contracts that govern the DeFi space. Oracles serve as a bridge providing up-to-date data — in this case real-worAld asset pricing data. This bridge is also a potential centralized point of failure in a decentralized system, which is why a lot of effort has been dedicated to developing decentralized oracles such as Chainlink (LINK) and Pyth Network. Jellyverse runs on the Sei Network, a layer one blockchain with parallel Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) execution. This allows the smart contracts that the DeFi space relies on to run much faster and allow for faster trades. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

In an announcement dated January 21, it was revealed that jAssets will enable users to create their own synthetic asset tokens, which will closely mirror the value of real-world assets. These tokens will be linked to traditional assets such as stocks, commodities, and precious metals. Jellyverse decided to proceed with this new feature after a proposal received a favorable response in a vote held by the protocol's decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).

To secure the value of synthetic assets and protect the protocol from asset loss, Jellyverse utilizes decentralized oracles and over-collateralization, ensuring that the collateral exceeds the value of synthetic assets.

A blockchain oracle is a service that supplies external, real-world data to a blockchain, permitting smart contracts to operate based on this information. Typically, smart contracts within the DeFi sector cannot directly access data from outside the blockchain.

The initial investment will be $100bn, and then the amount will be expanded. SoftBank CEO Masaesi Son, Sam Altman of OpenAI and Larry Ellison of Oracle were present at the event. ”China is a competitor, others are competitors. We want it to be in this country and we're making it available.” - Donald Trump said. ”AI holds incredible promise for all of us, for every American,” Ellison said, as he called it a ”very exciting program for Oracle to be a part of.” Oracle shares rose 7% in the January 21 trading session and continued their upward momentum in the post-market. Trump said the project would create more than 100,000 jobs for Americans almost immediately. Altman called it ‘the most important project of this era’ Three executives predicted improvements in the health care sector. ”I believe as this technology progresses, we will see diseases get cured at an unprecedented rate,' Altman said.

These tokens are priced below $1 and could post 8000% returns within the next ten months. What’s most exciting about them is that investors don’t need to break the bank to make explosive returns. Below are nine cryptocurrencies under $1 to end 2025 as a millionaire. Rexas Finance (RXS) Rexas Finance (RXS) is a promising new cryptocurrency that has caught the attention of investors through its recent presale, which was one of the most successful. The high demand for the token shows overwhelming confidence in the project. Holders even requested an additional stage after the eleventh stage ended. The presale was supposed to end in stage eleven. However, the Rexas community’s push for an extension led to the team organizing a poll that favored an extra phase. Thus, the RXS presale is still ongoing and in its last stage. The token sells for $0.20, with a fixed launch price of $0.25. The official listing will also occur on three top-tier exchanges. Rexas Finance focuses on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, offering a unique approach to asset management. Through tokenization, it addresses common issues in traditional finance like illiquidity, high costs, and lack of accessibility. This creates new opportunities for smaller investors and provides liquidity. One of Rexas Finance’s standout features is its ecosystem. The Rexas Token Builder allows anyone to create custom tokens, even without technical knowledge, while Rexas GenAI offers an AI-powered tool for creating digital artwork. Rexas QuickMint Bot simplifies token creation, even on mobile devices, further expanding the platform’s accessibility. Additionally, Rexas Estate facilitates fractional property ownership, enabling individuals to invest in real estate with smaller amounts of capital. Rexas Finance has built a loyal community through its focus on inclusivity and rewarding the support of its members. It has created a million-dollar giveaway to win twenty participants $50,000 worth of RXS tokens. Rexas Finance has a clear roadmap that has fueled speculations that it could go as high as $25, over an 8000% increase. This possibility is supported by its presale success and investors’ confidence. With its launch months from now, RXS could deliver gargantuan returns in 2025. Dogecoin (DOGE) DOGE whale’s recent activity has drawn the market’s attention to the dog-themed mem coin. Whales moved 600 million DOGE, valued at $231 million, between unknown wallets. These secretive transactions have sparked speculation about potential accumulation or price action. Dogecoin’s recent breakout of a bullish Symmetrical Triangle pattern has also sparked excitement. Trader sentiment has also fluctuated, with the long/short ratio fluctuating. DOGE’s dominance in the meme coin sector positions it as a top gainer in the coming bull run. This could see 8000% returns in the next 10 months. Dogwifhat (WIF) Dogwifhat (WIF), a Solana-based meme coin, is showing strong signs of a rebound after months of decline. Following Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance, WIF surged by 154% but later dropped to $1.50, which it consolidated before breaking out. WIF trades at $1.47 and faces major resistance at $1.80, a critical level for its next big move. Bullish on-chain metrics, such as high token transfers and DEX activity, signal growing demand. Technical indicators, including a rising MACD and oversold RSI, suggest the potential for a significant rally. If WIF breaches $1.80, it could target $2.50, positioning it as a high-potential crypto under $1. Pepecoin (PEPE) Pepecoin (PEPE), the third-largest memecoin, is gaining momentum with signs of a bullish rally. Reports of the SEC pausing non-fraud cases under Donald Trump’s administration boosted market sentiment, lifting PEPE alongside major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Experts highlight a bullish double-bottom pattern on PEPE’s daily chart, signaling potential gains. Trading above the 200-day EMA and with an RSI below overbought levels, PEPE shows room for further growth. If momentum holds, analysts predict a 22% surge to $0.000022, with the potential to climb higher. PEPE’s recovery within a symmetrical triangle pattern adds to its promising outlook for the months ahead. Hedera (HBAR) Hedera’s HBAR shows strong growth potential, with trading volumes exceeding $2.7 billion. Recent upgrades in its ecosystem have fueled its bullish momentum. Recently, Hedera updated its mainnet. It also made partnerships to tokenize $3 billion in luxury assets. HBAR’s price recently surged by 27%, breaking key resistance levels. It now trades above its 20-day Exponential Moving Average and is supported by bullish Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) signals. Experts predict it could revisit its all-time high of $0.57. HBAR is also on the list of cryptocurrencies that could get an ETF approval. If this happens, its value could easily skyrocket. Predictions suggest HBAR might hit $0.50, with some expecting highs of $1.20, making it a promising contender for significant returns under $1. Ethena (ENA) Ethena (ENA) is gaining traction as it trades near $1. Recent price action suggests a breakout from a parallel channel, hinting at further upward potential. However, analysts caution that failing to hold $0.86 as support could lead to corrections toward $0.69 or even $0.57. However, Ethena’s strong momentum and growing interest act as a support. ENA could soon hit $1 and reach higher targets in the coming months. Investors eyeing high-growth opportunities might find ETHA an attractive addition to their portfolio. Flare (FLR) Flare (FLR) shows promising potential for significant growth. It recently completed a corrective ABC structure and is poised for a bullish impulse. The recent surge above key Fibonacci levels indicates strong support at $0.027-$0.028. With a neutral daily RSI, the asset consolidates and prepares for a larger upward move. Analysts are watching the 1-hour chart for a breakout above resistance at $0.03255, which could signal further gains. If FLR continues its upward trajectory, it could reach targets near $0.034 and potentially higher, making it a strong contender for 8000% returns in the coming months. Stellar (XLM) SXLM has shown strong resilience, recovering from a critical support level of $0.43. This happened after a 7.35% to $0.46. This movement suggests the potential for further upward momentum. The coin has consistently stayed above 100 and 200 EMAs, confirming a long-term bullish trend. Its $147.96 million daily trading volume shows strong investor interest. If XLM breaks through the $0.48 resistance, it could reach $0.50 and beyond, signaling even more potential for gains. Its solid support levels and rising activity position XLM as a top-performing crypto in the coming months, possibly delivering an 8,000% increase. Sei (SEI) Sei (SEI) is gaining attention as it approaches a critical $0.37 resistance level. Crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe highlights this zone as pivotal for a potential bullish breakout. Currently trading around $0.35, SEI has seen increased market interest. Its trading volume has hit 15.2 million tokens, a 20% spike. On-chain activity also shows a 10% rise in active addresses, signaling growing network participation. If SEI surpasses $0.37, experts believe it could reach $0.42, sparking a new upward trend. It could eventually test new highs in the coming months. Its strong community interest and technical indicators make it a promising choice for 8000% gains in the next ten months. Conclusion These nine cryptocurrencies could grow remarkably in the next ten months, achieving up to 8,000%. Their bullish path is notable, and their current price action and future events set them up for higher gains. Rexas Finance presents a unique opportunity to buy into a new initiative with impressive early growth potential. In the first few months of its launch, it could post exponential gains that will skyrocket your value. Its price is still under $1 and as low as $0.20, lowering the entry barrier. Thus, now is a great time to buy before this last stage ends.",Sponsored,EN,0,0,TRADING|BUSINESS|DOGE|PEPE|HBAR,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-22 09:25:15

As part of the program, Crunch will receive mentorship and resources from the Solana Labs team, helping it expand its decentralized prediction network. Accordingly, the program will help pave the way for real-world applications of machine learning in finance , healthcare , and other industries. Crunch’s machine-learning approach With a growing community already comprising 7,000 machine learning engineers, scientists, and researchers from all over the world, Crunch focuses on delivering advanced artificial intelligence ( AI ) models. The collaborative approach has so far allowed the team to consistently outperform traditional centralized teams, helping the company stand out in both the AI and Web3 industries. Over three months of its Cohort 2 program, Solana will assist Crunch (and other promising startups) in becoming the next generation of blue-chip projects on the SOL blockchain . Jean Herelle, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) at Crunch, summarized the importance of the Solana partnership: “Being accepted into the Solana Incubator is a pivotal milestone for Crunch. Solana’s unparalleled speed and scalability align perfectly with our mission to democratize access to predictive intelligence. This support strengthens our ability to innovate, empowering a global network of contributors to redefine what’s possible in decentralized prediction modeling.” Of course, Crunch’s innovative model has already sparked interest, especially through partnerships with institutions such as ADIA Lab, Nobel Laureate Guido Imbens, and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. Developing advanced predictive models Crunch connects organizations with machine learning demands to its vast network of so-called crunchers, researchers and scientists designing various machine learning models tailored to these organizations’ needs. Addressing prediction challenges, aptly called Crunches within the ecosystem, rewards participants for building fast, customer-tailored predictive models. These models are then aggregated into continuously learning predictive feeds, refining their accuracy over time. Solana Incubator inclusion will further assist Crunch Lab in creating revenue-generating predictive models without investing in massive resources needed for raw data handling. Backed by Solana’s high-performance blockchain, new models will maintain scalability, security , and cost-effectiveness as they are deployed.

US investment bank TD Cowen has published a report stating that the TRUMP memecoin could pose a threat to bipartisan cryptocurrency legislation. According to The Block, TD Cowen analysts said that the TRUMP memecoin will be investigated by Democrats, who will demand information on whether foreign governments and companies purchased the token to curry favor with Trump. Analysts have said Trump and his administration would not accept or cooperate with such an investigation launched by Democrats, which could stoke partisan tensions. TD Cowen analysts led by Jaret Seiberg wrote: “Democrats will demand details on whether foreign governments and commercial companies used token purchases to favor Team Trump, This puts at risk the ability to advance the crypto bill with the bipartisan support needed. This is why we are concerned about Trump's decision to launch a memecoin.” TD Cowen analysts recently predicted that the cryptocurrency bill would be delayed until 2026 as both parties focus on midterm election campaigns. *This is not investment advice.

The world's largest cryptocurrency was trading around $105,000 at publication time. Management and investor attention is also increasingly being drawn toward alternative uses for these companies' sizable power supplies, especially artificial intelligence (AI) data center hosting.

""Early demand forecasts point toward AI dwarfing the traditional cloud hosting market over time,"" analysts led by Joseph Vafi wrote. More co-hosting deals are expected to be announced early this year, with potential news from Galaxy Digital (GLXY) and Applied Digital (APLD), the report said. Many of the larger publicly traded miners are using their access to capital to upgrade their fleets following last April's reward halving event , and this is strengthening their competitive position and share of the network hashrate, Canaccord said.

Hype Broken The Record The surge in trade volume highlights Hyperliquid’s ability to attract traders with its innovative offerings. Along with the record-breaking volume, the platform saw $4.7 billion in open interest, signaling high engagement from users.

These impressive figures suggest that the platform’s upward trend is not a one-off but part of a broader pattern of success. What Makes Hyperliquid Stands Out Several factors contribute to Hyperliquid’s success. The platform offers low fees, making it attractive to high-frequency traders.

These issues have sparked concerns about the exchange's liquidity and operational practices. Many are questioning whether Coinbase is staking users' SOL without their consent, potentially causing delays due to unstaking processes. Reports of transaction delays have frustrated users, with some sharing experiences of transactions pending for over a day. One investigative journalist noted their transaction was canceled after a full 24-hour wait. Some users suspect Coinbase is using deposited SOL for staking to generate yield, which could explain the delays when large withdrawals require unstaking. Criticism has intensified following the collapse of FTX , which highlighted the risks of poor management and lack of transparency in centralized exchanges. Calls for Proof of Reserves (PoR) have grown louder , with many users demanding Coinbase demonstrate its solvency and operational integrity. CryptoCurb, a prominent figure in the crypto community, accused Coinbase of staking customer funds without consent and urged the exchange to undergo immediate PoR audits. He also criticized the industry for moving away from the PoR reforms introduced after FTX’s collapse. Blockchain-tracking platform Whale Alert has flagged multiple large SOL transactions from unknown wallets to Coinbase, adding to speculation about the exchange’s liquidity. Coinbase Support attributed the delays to technical and blockchain-related issues , but developers and industry insiders have offered alternative explanations. Mert Helius, a well-known developer, argued that the problem lies within Coinbase’s infrastructure, which struggles to handle Solana’s fast transaction speeds. According to Helius, Coinbase’s system likely generalizes indexing across blockchains without adapting to Solana’s unique characteristics. Adding to the controversy, Coinbase’s largest Solana validator is reportedly set to unstake 567,000 SOL, worth roughly $130 million, at the end of the current epoch. This has led users to question whether Coinbase ran out of liquid SOL and is now waiting for the unstaking process to complete before processing withdrawals. This is not the first time Coinbase’s custodial practices have faced scrutiny. Recently, BlackRock amended its IBIT Bitcoin ETF filing, responding to concerns over Coinbase’s role as custodian. Investors called for on-chain proof of Bitcoin purchases to ensure transparency. The filing noted that Coinbase Custody is required to process withdrawals to public blockchain addresses within 12 hours of receiving a client’s instructions, subject to a confirmed minimum balance. In the midst of these issues, Coinbase recently launched Bitcoin-backed loans for USDC , a move that has drawn mixed reactions from the crypto community. While this new offering highlights Coinbase’s effort to innovate, the ongoing SOL delays and liquidity concerns have raised doubts about the exchange’s transparency and operational reliability. Amid heightened skepticism, users continue to demand clear evidence of Coinbase’s financial health and business practices.",,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|SOL|BTC|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-22 09:44:47

His disclosure came during a discussion on X (formerly Twitter) about his dedication to the crypto industry and the limited financial returns for his investigative work. In response to a comment calling him the busiest person in crypto due to the rising number of scams, ZachXBT shared: ""When the U.S. government got hacked for $20 million, I helped recover a sizable amount of those funds. I was rewarded zero for that."" He added that he has many similar examples, highlighting how much of his work remains uncompensated despite its significance. ZachXBT’s work has been critical in exposing major scams and holding bad actors accountable. His investigations have led to the arrest of hackers involved in a $243 million crypto theft. By tracing blockchain transactions, he enabled authorities to identify and apprehend those responsible. Additionally, he has uncovered intricate schemes, such as fraudulent meme coin promotions and traders operating multiple wallets to deceive investors. For instance, he identified a trader linked to 11 crypto wallets and exposed another individual managing 16 accounts to promote scam projects. Despite these achievements, ZachXBT has emphasized that financial gain has never been his primary motivation. However, his lack of compensation has sparked debates about the crypto industry’s reliance on unpaid, independent investigators. His efforts have saved millions and helped rebuild trust, yet they highlight a systemic issue: many investigators work without institutional support or financial rewards. The crypto community has rallied around ZachXBT. Joey Moose, a well-known NFT holder, launched a fundraising campaign to support his work, sharing wallet addresses for Bitcoin , Ethereum, and Solana donations. Moose encouraged others to contribute, stating: ""If you made tons of money this week, consider sending something for good karma."" The initiative received mixed reactions, with some questioning its legitimacy since ZachXBT already has a public donation address on his account. One user humorously warned Moose against keeping the funds, noting that ZachXBT might investigate him if he did. As scams and hacks in the crypto space rise, the need for investigators like ZachXBT has become increasingly apparent. Recently, scammers attempted to launch a meme coin named after Barron Trump, Donald and Melania Trump’s son. The fraudulent post, which claimed “The Official Barron Meme is live,” quickly drew attention before being called out and taken down. This incident follows the rise of other Trump-related meme coins , which have also faced scrutiny for their questionable intentions. The broader issue of fair compensation for investigative work remains unresolved. ZachXBT’s case underlines the challenges faced by independent investigators in the crypto world. His ability to uncover scams and recover stolen funds demonstrates his value to the industry, yet his efforts are often unrecognized financially. The debate over compensating such vital work continues, as the industry grapples with growing security concerns and a lack of transparency. The question remains: how can the crypto space adequately support those who protect it from fraud?",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MINING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-22 09:47:57

The UAE-based firm agreed to plead guilty to two counts of fraudulent manipulation of trading volumes and wire fraud in a plea deal yesterday. CLS Global involvement in alleged crypto wash trading scheme CLS Global participated in wash trading, which is the practice of buying and selling assets at the same time to generate false market activity. This method of trading is considered illegal and is seen as a form of market manipulation in many countries. As part of the plea deal CLS Global agreed to yesterday, the firm will have to pay a fine of $428,059, as well as forfeit all of the funds it holds in different accounts on prominent crypto exchanges Binance and KuCoin. Additionally, CLS Global agreed to stop providing services to anyone in the United States and was placed on probation for 3 years. The firm will also have to make annual certification to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to show that it is adhering to the prohibition. The SEC also filed civil charges against CLS Global in October last year for alleged securities laws violations. The regulator has entered into its own resolution with the firm. “Moneys seized from or paid by CLS Global will be credited in the SEC resolution, and vice versa,” the district attorney’s office said. FBI conducted sting operation to address crypto fraud The NEXF token was created as part of a sting operation by the US Federal Bureau of Intelligence (FBI) to track down illicit actors in the crypto space who participate in pump-and-dump operations. NEXF was positioned as an AI crypto, and was used by authorities to monitor transactions and detect fraudulent activities. This is the first time the FBI has developed a fake token to unmask market manipulators. Following the token’s launch, the FBI reached out to individuals and businesses in the crypto space that claimed to offer vital services for new crypto projects, such as market making. Given the decentralized nature of the Web3 space, it is easier for unregulated firms to artificially raise a token’s price and trading volumes, leading to a false sense of popularity in the market and subsequently baiting unsuspecting traders and investors. CLS Global is not the only bad actor caught through the NEXF token sting operation. The US Justice Department revealed in October last year that 18 individuals faced charges in the combined cases. Another leading financial company, MyTrade MM, also faces allegations for offering services to NextFundAI.

With both coins suffering steep declines since January. 7, investors are leaving in large numbers. Instead, they are investing in Rexas Finance (RXS), a project with real-world utility and great development potential. Why Investors Are Leaving Shiba Inu and Pepe Coin The ongoing crypto market decline highlighted the major issues with meme coin investments. While it affects the general market, top memecoins like Pepe Coin and Shiba Inu led the fall. According to CoinGecko, PEPE and SHIB have lost 12% and 15% in the past 48 hours, respectively. The rapid fall isn’t surprising. Memecoins thrive on speculation and drop significantly in bearish markets. For instance, after rising 150% to its all-time high (ATH) of $0.00002803 last December, PEPE is now about 40% below such a high in less than a month. SHIB is also facing a similar fate as it trades 75% below its 2021 ATH of $0.00008616. Investors often move their money from memecoins during market falls due to this inability to retain gains. Both PEPE and SHIB also practice inflammatory tokenomics, which is significantly impacting their price performance. Despite the Shiba Inu ecosystem reducing the circulating tokens via Shibburn, there are still about 500 trillion SHIB floating in the market. Therefore, many believe they are shit coins meant for short-term gains. Investors consider coins with practical use cases and favorable tokenomics for long-term gains. As the ongoing bearishness looks to extend, investors are accumulating Rexas Finance (RXS), a more reliable, inventive, and sustainable project as its ongoing presale hits new highs. Investors Rushing to Rexas Finance (RXS) as Its Token Sale Crosses 400 Million Tokens Sold Rexas Finance’s ongoing presale has become a hotspot for investors looking for more viable, utility-backed cryptocurrency. As Rexas Finance hits Stage 11 of its presale, 95% of the stage has been sold, spotlighting the presale popularity among investors. The project has already raised $37.6 million, with 405 million RXS tokens sold. The token price has nearly sixfold increased, with each token currently priced at $0.175 compared to $0.03 at Stage 1. Rexas Finance is unique in that it tokenizes real-world assets (RWA). This function offers tokenization solutions for assets, including real estate, commodities, and more, bridging the gap between conventional asset markets and the blockchain sector. Rexas Finance is built on blockchain technology, leveraging decentralized finance (DeFi) capabilities and providing powerful tools such as the No-code Rexas Token Builder, Rexas QuickMint Bot for swift token deployment on social apps, and Rexas Treasury that offers passive income via staking, yield farming, and liquidity pooling. The project combines AI-driven solutions with Rexas AI Shield to maintain blockchain security. This innovation attracts investors looking for a token beyond speculative trading and providing real-world answers. Furthermore, Rexas Finance practices a deflationary model. This strategy of circulating supply control creates scarcity and demand for the token. The ongoing $1 million giveaway, which promises to reward each of the 20 top participants with $50,000 worth of RXS, also draws investors. With over 800,000 entries received, investors are exploring a rare opportunity to accumulate a large amount of RXS with no additional cost. The ongoing presale remains appealing to investors. After the presale concludes, RXS tokens will debut on at least three of the top ten global crypto exchanges. Experts believe the token could witness a potential growth rate of more than 27,500% from its present presale price. Why are investors flocking to Rexas Finance? It’s simple: practical utility, promising tokenomics, the ongoing giveaway, ongoing presale success, and the possibility of substantial rewards post-listing. Ultimately, investors are lured to RXS for its long-term growth prospects and impending listings, which make it a potentially profitable investment. Conclusion The transition from meme coins such as Shiba Inu and Pepe Coin to Rexas Finance demonstrates investors’ shifting focus toward projects with compelling use cases and strong tokenomics. While meme coins suffer from market instability and unattainable growth ambitions, Rexas Finance’s continued success in presale, backed by real-world applications such as RWA tokenization, makes it a clear leader in 2025. Rexas Finance provides a comprehensive ecosystem with significant market potential. With its presale nearing completion and major exchange listings on the horizon, Rexas Finance is primed for exponential development, providing investors with the opportunity to make significant returns in a fast-expanding crypto world.

An analyst has discovered a chart which hints at a massive XRP rally. XRP has surged 488% since Trump’s election victory. Donald Trump was sworn in as the 47th U.S. President on Monday (January 20), but his inaugural speech avoided any mention of Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies, leaving markets anticipating pro-crypto policies in the days ahead. During the event, Bitcoin experienced sharp price fluctuations, falling to $100,000 after peaking at over $109,000 overnight. XRP, however, stood out with a remarkable 488% surge since Trump’s election victory, outperforming most other cryptocurrencies during this period. According to a cryptocurrency analyst, a new chart has surfaced offering details into the possible price movement of XRP in the coming days and weeks. This chart compares the first quarter of 2017—following President Donald Trump’s inauguration—with the current market in early 2025.

The price jump was accompanied by increased trading activity, with its daily trading volume rising 28.8% to nearly $500 million. The gains followed increased demand for the token in the futures market. According to CoinGlass data , the open interest in the AI16Z futures market was up 33% over the past day at over $213 million. Investor interest in AI16Z spiked following multiple exchange listings in recent days. On Jan. 22, Kraken Pro added the altcoin to its perpetual futures market, providing traders access to leveraged positions. Just days earlier, on Jan. 20, decentralized trading platform dYdX also listed the token, further expanding its market reach. Some notable partnerships have also supported the recent rally. ai16z ( AI16Z ) partnered with decentralized infrastructure builder Hyperbolic on Jan. 21 to leverage its scalable compute marketplace and verifiable inference services, along with its agent creation toolkit to improve the capabilities of AI agents deployed on its AI operating system, ElizaOS. You might also like: Marc Andreessen discusses DOGE; AI16Z’s Eliza set for major update ElizaOS was also integrated into the decentralized trading app Bebop , which will allow AI agents developed on ElizaOS to carry out more efficient trades. Such developments are typically well received by the project’s community as they enhance the platform’s overall performance. Growing optimism around the project is evident in the increased interest from Smart Money Investors , who have accumulated approximately $790k worth of AI16Z tokens over the past 24 hours, according to Nansen data . Analysts expect a continuation of the rally Pseudo-anonymous trader CryptoBull believes the altcoin could rally 75% from its recently tested support zone of around $0.80. https://twitter.com/CryptoBull_360/status/1881755442306847222 An even higher target was previously projected by analyst Ali Martinez, who noted in a Jan. 16 X post that AI16Z was trading within an ascending parallel channel that has been forming since late December. He also pointed to $0.80 as a key support level. AI16Z recently bounced back from the $0.80 level on Jan. 20, confirming strong support at this level. Martinez projects a potential rally toward $2.60, a 113% increase from the current price, provided AI16Z continues to trade within the ascending channel in the coming weeks. AI16Z price and 50-day EMA chart — Jan. 22 | Source: crypto.news Technical indicators also support the bullish forecasts. On the 1-day AI16Z/USDT chart, AI16Z’s price was positioned above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average, suggesting that bulls continue to remain in power. AI16Z Supertrend and RSI chart — Jan. 22 | Source: crypto.news According to the Relative Strength Index indicator, the price is yet to reach overbought levels. At press time, RSI was sitting at 49, with levels above 70 considered the overbought zone. This means the altcoin’s rally can extend further if trend strength holds. However, the Supertrend line floating above the price points to a potential dip for AI16Z before continuing the rally.

The proposal, called the Blockchain and Digital Innovation Amendments (H.B. 230), was put forward by State Representative Jordan Teuscher and aims to establish a clear framework for digital asset investments while ensuring regulatory oversight and financial responsibility. The bill outlines that up to 10% of public funds could be invested in qualifying digital assets. These include assets with a market capitalization exceeding $500 billion over the past year or any stablecoin meeting regulatory criteria. This groundbreaking proposal reflects Utah’s ambition to lead in blockchain and digital finance innovation . Teuscher expressed excitement about the initiative on X (formerly Twitter), emphasizing the state’s commitment to adopting cutting-edge technologies. “Utah is proud to lead the way in blockchain and digital innovation. This bill reflects our dedication to preparing for the future of finance while maintaining fiscal sovereignty,” he stated. In addition to investments, the bill includes protections for digital asset use within Utah. It prevents state or local governments from limiting the acceptance of digital assets for payments or restricting the use of self-custody wallets like hardware wallets. These provisions aim to safeguard individual rights and encourage the growth of the crypto economy in the state. The proposal is part of a larger trend in the U.S., where states like Wyoming, Texas, Massachusetts, and Oklahoma are exploring similar legislation. These efforts include establishing Strategic Bitcoin Reserves, a concept gaining popularity among state lawmakers. Dennis Porter, CEO and Co-Founder of the Satoshi Action Fund, highlighted the growing interest in this movement, stating on X, “The FOMO for Strategic Bitcoin Reserves is at an all-time high!” Despite the enthusiasm surrounding state-level initiatives, broader adoption at the federal level remains uncertain. Polymarket data recently showed that the odds of former President Donald Trump establishing a Bitcoin reserve within his first 100 days in office dropped significantly—from 48% on inauguration day to 30% at the time of reporting. While optimism remains strong in certain circles, challenges persist in achieving widespread acceptance. If passed, Utah’s legislation is set to take effect on May 7, 2025. This move could cement the state’s role as a leader in the U.S. crypto industry, setting a precedent for other regions to follow. It marks a significant step forward in integrating blockchain technology into public finance while balancing innovation with accountability.",,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-22 09:53:00

On Inauguration Day, its market value soared to more than $10 billion, while enthusiasm over his pro-crypto administration helped lift Bitcoin to a new all-time high of $109,000. Trump’s memecoin rose from just $4.29 on January 18 to as high as $74.59 before reversing some gains. On January 21, the $TRUMP token was trading at $33.37, according to CoinGecko , down 46.7% in the last 24 hours. According to the Official Trump website, the Trump Organization and affiliates hold 80% of the coins. The new president’s support for crypto is overwhelmingly evident. The Trump family also has financial interests in the crypto-related World Liberty Financial. Friday’s Crypto Ball attracted industry leaders such as Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Kraken co-founder Jesse Powell, whose exchanges make the coin available to ordinary investors. $TRUMP can also be purchased on Binance, Bybit, OKX, Bitget, KuCoin, etc. The Trump family followed up on this success with the introduction of $MELANIA on January 19, named after the first lady. The coin quickly added more than 40% to its value, surpassing a market cap of $2 billion. $TRUMP project data At the time of writing, the market cap of Official Trump was $6.57 billion, and the coin ranked #30 on CoinGecko. The market cap is calculated by multiplying the number of $TRUMP tokens in circulation by the token price. The current market supply available for trading is 200 million tokens. The maximum supply of $TRUMP is set at a billion tokens, and the coin’s fully diluted valuation (FDV) is $32.83 billion. This is a statistical representation of the upper limit of the market cap, assuming all the tokens to be issued were already in circulation. Depending on the emission schedule of the tokens, it can take years to realize the FDV. The time between launching a cryptocurrency and its listing on centralized exchanges varies widely, depending on factors such as the project’s visibility, funding, community support, and exchange-specific listing requirements. Some projects are listed within weeks of their initial launch, especially if strong teams, funding, or partnerships back them. However, most projects need 3 to 12 months to secure a listing on a major CEX. This period allows the project to build a user base, demonstrate technological progress, and meet exchange criteria. Exploring memetics theory The listing of $TRUMP was practically immediate. Critics argue that this casts doubt on the coin’s prospects and, indeed, most memecoins are speculative and transient in nature. However, the memetics theory would appear to counter that argument, at least where some tokens are concerned. This theory considers cultural evolution based on Darwinian principles, with the meme as the culture unit. Biologist Richard Dawkins coined the term “meme” in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene. He maintains that all evolutionary processes depend on copying and selecting information, a process referred to as variation with selective retention. The replicator conveys the information being copied, while genes function as replicators in biological evolution. According to Dawkins, cultural evolution is driven by the same process. The meme is the second replicator. Dawkins cites examples such as fashion, technology, and music. We can add memecoins to the list. Similarly to genes, the properties of memes influence their chances of being replicated and passed on. In other words, the valuable and useful ones survive and thrive. Let’s take LADYS , a memecoin founded in 2023, as an example. It captured organic attention right from the get-go and then received a nod from Elon Musk on X, leading to a huge spike in the price. Musk tweeted, “There is no meme, I love you.” He did not think LADYS was a copy of a copy like most memes but represented an actual asset. Users can purchase the token on centralized exchanges like KuCoin, Bybit, HTX, Gate.io, MEXC, Crypto.com, Bitget, and more. They must undergo an ID verification process on some of these exchanges and fund their account to buy LADYS. Will $TRUMP return to its all-time high? The price trajectory will likely depend on whether Donald Trump achieves goals like economic growth, reducing inflation, taking control of the Panama Canal, etc. The $TRUMP token is poised to become a barometer of the president’s popularity and the impact of his new laws. Recent policy announcements, such as proposed tariffs on Mexico and Canada, have introduced market uncertainties. These developments have caused fluctuations in traditional financial markets and could indirectly affect the cryptocurrency sector, including $TRUMP. The new administration has embraced the sector, though. Trump promised the US would become “the crypto capital of the planet” during his campaign. He is expected to end the “reign of terror” of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in its previous composition, which became notorious for stifling enforcement actions. Paul Atkins, CEO of a consulting firm with crypto clients and former US Securities and Exchange Commissioner, will lead the SEC. Atkins supports cryptocurrencies and disagreed with some of the Commission’s measures against the US crypto industry during his tenure. Trump also appointed venture capitalist David Sacks to guide crypto and artificial intelligence. Cryptocurrency could get a boost from a GOP-controlled Congress. Republican Rep. French Hill, who chairs the Financial Services Committee, has pushed for measures to support the industry. While President Trump’s supportive crypto policies may create a conducive environment for $TRUMP’s appreciation, factors like centralized token ownership and broader economic policies could contribute to price volatility.",Information,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-22 09:53:29

Markus Thielen, head of research at 10x Research, noted in a recent market report that Bitcoin has “successfully retested its wedge breakout” after bouncing from $98,937 to over $107,000 on January 21. This price movement, Thielen explained, presents a “low-risk, high-reward entry opportunity” for traders. By placing stop-loss orders at $98,000, traders can limit downside risks while positioning for significant upside potential. Thielen further emphasized that Bitcoin has established a pattern of rising in $16,000 to $18,000 increments since the approval of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs last year. Based on this pattern, he predicts that Bitcoin could reach $122,000 by February, though a consolidation phase may follow. Analysts Signal Higher Potential Beyond $122K While $122,000 serves as a near-term target, Thielen believes Bitcoin’s rally could extend even further . If the current pattern holds, Bitcoin could trade significantly above $122,000 before retesting that level as support. Breaking above the $106,000 threshold is a crucial indicator of this sustained momentum, according to Thielen. Echoing this sentiment, Keith Alan, co-founder of Material Indicators, highlighted Bitcoin’s breakout from a “cup-and-handle” pattern on its weekly chart as a bullish signal. Alan projected that Bitcoin could reclaim all-time high territory, asserting, “Bitcoin has reclaimed the key moving averages and is grinding back toward ATH territory.” Bitfinex analysts also expressed confidence in Bitcoin’s resilience, describing its recovery as an “impressive relative strength” compared to traditional markets. This strength, coupled with growing institutional interest, underscores Bitcoin’s potential to maintain upward momentum in the coming weeks. Outlook Remains Bullish The backdrop for Bitcoin’s rally includes Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20, which coincided with Bitcoin testing its upper wedge resistance around $101,000. Since then, Bitcoin has shown strong technical recovery, encouraging both retail and institutional traders to eye higher price targets. While optimism abounds, analysts caution that the market’s dynamic nature requires careful risk management. As traders set their sights on $122,000 and beyond, Bitcoin’s ability to sustain its breakout will be critical in defining its trajectory in the weeks ahead.

As we approach 2025, selecting the right platform for trading is crucial. This piece highlights three standout market-making firms that are worth considering for trading approaches and investments. These companies excel by facilitating smooth transactions and providing necessary liquidity across diverse financial markets. 1. Gravity Gravity is a company specializing in algorithmic crypto trading, focusing on efficiency and liquidity within crypto markets. It's quickly becoming a benchmark for crypto market makers. Founded in 2017, the company boasts a team of about 60 professionals who are expanding alongside its international presence and trading volume. Since its inception, Gravity has reached a cumulative trading volume of around $400 billion. The company holds 1% of the global crypto spot trading volume, operates across over two dozen major crypto exchanges, and gives access to more than 1,400 crypto asset pairs. What sets Gravity apart is its strong foothold in emerging markets, offering a competitive edge in a crowded field. Large-scale projects seeking liquidity in new markets often choose Gravity for broader exposure. Users can access fiat liquidity within less common markets. Gravity achieves balance through high-frequency trading and partnerships with various stakeholders in the industry. It carefully selects projects in the Web3 space to market-make their coins or tokens and collaborates with centralized exchanges (CEXs) to provide liquidity. Gravity meets its objectives using cutting-edge tools, a close-knit team of experienced professionals, and a wealth of industry knowledge. As a responsible liquidity partner, Gravity reduces risk concerns and attracts more clientele, thereby generating additional liquidity. 2. Wintermute Wintermute is a global algorithmic trading platform focused on digital assets, aiming to create highly efficient and liquid markets across both centralized and decentralized exchanges. The platform supports liquidity on numerous exchanges and trading platforms, significantly influencing digital asset markets. By partnering with promising projects, Wintermute enhances liquidity, supporting a wide array of profitable trading pairs and collaborating with all major exchanges. One of Wintermute's key advantages includes providing token liquidity round-the-clock without charging monthly or integration fees and maintaining competitive spreads even in volatile markets. Their adept DeFi team facilitates the bridging of tokens from other blockchains to Ethereum. 3. Keyrock Many successful markets are underpinned by highly liquid assets. Keyrock enhances its clients' liquidity to foster equitable and efficient markets, positioning digital assets for future success. The company's team of experts and algorithms continuously monitor platforms to offer additional support when necessary. Their market-making algorithms provide consistent pricing and performance tracking around the clock. Clients benefit from comprehensive trading insights and statistics on demand. Keyrock ensures transparency by compiling price data and liquidity from nearly 100 exchanges, attracting traders with extensive market quotes. The platform facilitates trading and aligns prices, eliminating discrepancies across markets. Consequently, clients enjoy harmonized prices and narrower bid-ask spreads. A seamless trading experience allows clients to easily enter and exit trading positions. The algorithms ensure that markets can absorb a substantial number of trades, with high-volume transactions instilling confidence at the right price. Tackling Challenges: Volatility, Innovation, and Regulatory Demands Today's market makers confront a wide array of challenges that test their flexibility, adaptability, and resilience. While volatility can present profit opportunities, it also poses significant risks. During high volatility, bid-ask spreads can widen, increasing the risk of asset loss. The three market makers mentioned employ advanced risk management strategies to handle volatility, such as dynamic pricing models that evaluate real-time market conditions and adjust spreads accordingly. They hedge positions and efficiently manage inventory levels through algorithmic trading strategies. Diversification across various markets and assets is another approach used to mitigate risk. Innovation is key, with new technologies and products continually entering the financial scene. Market makers must embrace this trend to remain competitive. They explore new markets, adopt the latest technologies, and develop innovative trading algorithms to stay relevant. Significant investments in research and development promote innovation. Teams grow to include skilled developers and traders who craft new algorithms and trading strategies. They keep up with technological advancements by partnering with solution providers and participating in industry consortia. Market makers incorporate AI, cloud computing, and blockchain technology to enhance operations. Another significant challenge is regulatory pressure. Financial market regulations vary by jurisdiction, and compliance incurs substantial costs. Legitimate market makers understand that non-compliance can lead to reputational damage and hefty fines. The reviewed market makers manage regulatory pressures by investing in specialized legal and compliance teams. They use advanced compliance software to monitor real-time transactions, ensuring all trades adhere to applicable regulations. Ongoing staff training on best practices and regulatory changes also helps mitigate compliance risks. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Despite Gensler’s exit, the Ripple-SEC legal battle continues, with disputes over XRP’s classification and an ongoing appeal delaying resolution. Incoming Resolution or Just Another Speculation? The lawsuit between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) remains ongoing despite numerous legal developments and changes in the agency’s leadership. Recall that the regulator’s Chairman, Gary Gensler, officially stepped down on January 20 and was replaced by crypto proponent Mark Uyeda. The Commission has scheduled its first closed meeting under the new Acting Chairman for January 23, causing the XRP Army to speculate that the case against Ripple might be on the agenda this time. Some of the most optimistic predictions include a dismissal of the lawsuit. It is worth mentioning that the SEC conducts such meetings quite frequently, and there are no public records showing that it has touched upon the aforementioned legal tussle in any of them. Marc Fagel – a former regional director of the SEC for the San Francisco office – claimed that those expecting “something monumental to happen” at the upcoming gathering “are about to be disappointed.” “This is the same meeting they hold nearly every week. They will vote on recommendations calendared weeks ago,” he assumed. Not so Fast The anti-crypto Gensler might be out of the SEC, but the official resolution of the case against Ripple remains challenging. After all, the entities have been confronting each other in court for over four years, throwing punches at each other on every possible occasion. The core issue in the lawsuit is whether XRP (Ripple’s native token) should be classified as a security. The SEC argues it was sold as an unregistered investment, while the company insists it is a digital asset used for payments and not subject to securities laws. In 2023, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP sales on public exchanges to retail investors did not constitute securities transactions. A year later, she ordered Ripple to pay a fine of $125 million for violating certain rules. The penalty represented just a fraction of the $2 billion the SEC initially asked for, and somewhat expected, the firm was ready to settle it. However, the watchdog appealed the 2023 verdict and recently filed the necessary opening brief, thus prolonging the lawsuit indefinitely.

This groundbreaking launch provides Finnish investors with a secure and regulated way to invest in cryptocurrency, all denominated in euros, making it a significant step forward for the region’s financial market. The integration of crypto into Finland’s €20.5 billion ETP market represents a major advancement. The products are fully collateralized and physically backed, with liquidity support from Flow Traders to ensure reliable trading volumes and tight spreads, boosting investor confidence. These ETPs include offerings like Bitcoin exposure, Ethereum with staking benefits for enhanced annual returns, XRP, Solana with staking rewards of 3%, and an altcoin index covering up to ten different cryptocurrencies. Investors can access these products through major brokers like Nordnet, with staking rewards reflected directly in daily pricing. Virtune CEO Christopher Kock highlighted that the euro-denominated ETPs address the increasing demand for crypto investments in a secure and regulated environment. Nasdaq Helsinki President Henrik Husman emphasized that these products offer access to alternative investments while maintaining the transparency of a regulated marketplace. Helena Wedin, European Head of Exchange Traded Products at Nasdaq, underscored the importance of this development, noting Nasdaq’s strong 23% market share in the European crypto ETP space. Wedin described Virtune’s entry into Nasdaq Helsinki as a significant achievement for the market. This launch is part of a larger trend across Europe, where the crypto ETP sector is experiencing rapid growth. Industry leaders such as Bitwise and 21Shares are also expanding their offerings, introducing innovative products like Solana Staking ETPs and ETPs focusing on AI-related tokens. These developments showcase the growing opportunities for regulated crypto investments in the European market, which continues to attract institutional and retail investors. While Europe advances in the ETP sector, the U.S. still faces challenges in expanding crypto ETFs beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Efforts to launch ETFs tied to altcoins like Litecoin, Hedera, Solana , and XRP remain ongoing, with optimism hinging on potential regulatory changes under a new SEC administration. Market analysts predict significant growth, with over 50 crypto-related ETF products expected to launch in the U.S., ranging from options-based products to equity ETFs denominated in Bitcoin. Virtune’s debut in Finland signals a new era for crypto investments in the Nordic region. This development not only marks a significant achievement for Finland but also positions Virtune as a leader in regulated crypto offerings. The launch could pave the way for broader adoption and innovation in the Nordic financial markets, setting a precedent for other regions to follow.

BTC Calms at $105K The primary cryptocurrency jumped past $100,000 at the end of the previous business week and went to a high of $105,000 on Friday. While the weekend was less eventful on the BTC front, despite the two Trump-related meme coins, the asset maintained its level and even surged to $106,000 on Monday morning. Then came the volatile ride that pushed the asset to under $100,000. In minutes, it had recovered all losses and skyrocketed even further to just over $109,000 to register a new all-time high. All of these movements transpired in the span of just a few hours. Once Trump’s inauguration began on Monday afternoon, BTC’s price started to tumble again and plunged to $100,000 once again as he failed to mention crypto even once. Nevertheless, the bulls intervened at this point and drove the cryptocurrency to $107,000 yesterday. It has lost some ground since then and now trades a lot more calmly around $105,000.

Source: TradingView Alts in Recovery Mode Most alternative coins have turned green today after yesterday’s retracements. Solana and Dogecoin have popped up as the top performers, with both gaining around 6%. As a result, SOL has risen to over $250, while DOGE, which exploded yesterday at one point, is now above $0.36. ETH, XRP, BNB, and ADA have posted minor gains, while TRX, LINK, and AVAX have added around 3-4% of value. Other notable price gainers since yesterday include HYPE and CRO, as the exchange behind the latter launched in the US.

Notably, these tokens are surging amid broader AI-related developments such as Donald Trump’s ‘Stargate’ formation and tech giants injecting massive investments in the industry. As a result, the abovementioned AI coins witnessed remarkable intraday price gains worth 6%-12%. Here’s a collective overview of the potential factors driving a frenzy across the AI crypto industry. AI Coins FET, RENDER, & Others Bullish As Donald Trump Announces ‘Stargate’ Formation Notably, the 47th president of the U.S., Donald Trump, has unveiled plans to offer massive support to the broader artificial intelligence sector soon after his inauguration. Addressing the nation’s masses, Trump recently announced the formation of ‘Stargate,’ the largest AI infrastructure project in American history. Intriguingly, this AI project is set to invest a staggering $500 billion into the U.S. economy and curate over 100,000 American jobs. Trump revealed that OpenAI, Softbank, and Oracle came together to announce the formation of this monumental feat. Overall, with the developmental saga weighing in, top AI Coins like FET and others also appear to be bullish as the broader sector’s outlook glimmers with hope for further growth. Google Chimes In With Massive Investment In AI Meanwhile, the tech behemoth Google has also revealed plans to invest heavily in the sector. According to a recent FT report , the tech giant is investing more than $1 billion in Anthropic, a prominent OpenAI rival. Meanwhile, people familiar with the matter have also revealed that Google is set to invest about $2 billion in Anthropic. Further, Lightspeed Venture Partners emerged as another key backer for the OpenAI rival as it is expected to inject $2 billion into the entity. Overall, these massive investments in the AI sector have further glimmered hope for tokens FET, RENDER, and TAO, among many others. AI Coins Rise In Sync With Broader Market Recovery At the time of reporting, FET price witnessed gains worth 11% intraday and is currently trading at $1.30. The coin’s 24-hour low and high were $1.16 and $1.34, respectively. Further, RENDER price witnessed a 7% uptick in value and is currently resting at $7.09. The coin’s 24-hour low and high were $6.60 and $7.36, respectively. Even TAO price pumped 6% intraday to reach $418.21. The coin’s 24-hour low and high were $391.79 and $433.29, respectively. As mentioned above, the AI tokens appear to be leveraging a positive market sentiment across the AI sector, primarily attributable to the massive investments. Further, it’s also worth mentioning that the broader crypto market recovered today, aligning with the upswing in the price of AI coins.

After experiencing a brief dip toward $2.83 over the weekend, following an unsuccessful attempt to breach its all-time high of $3.40 set seven years ago, the sentiment surrounding XRP remains bullish. Market Expert Foresees XRP Propelling To $53 In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), market expert and technical analyst Egrag Crypto shared encouraging price targets for XRP investors, suggesting that historical price patterns indicate a possible blow-off top that could drive the token into double-digit territory. Egrag highlighted three historical blow-off tops, demonstrating impressive percentage increases that XRP has experienced in the past: one saw a rise of 1,068%, another 2,636%, and a third recorded an increase of 406%.

Egrag previously noted the importance of a critical price range between $4 and $5, indicating that once XRP reaches approximately $4.40, it will enter a “powerful energy field” that could significantly propel prices higher. The analyst emphasized that traders should closely monitor price action, candle formations, and oscillator behaviors in this range to determine whether the market is poised for a substantial rally or facing a potential correction. Despite the optimistic outlook, Egrag urged caution, stating, “I’m still feeling #BULLISHAF, but it’s crucial to remain level-headed when trading and investing, especially with #XRP.” He expressed concern that market dynamics might be encouraging retail investors to exit, which could be a strategy to enable the emergence of two-digit prices. Aiming For A 40% Surge Amid Impressive Monthly Performance Supporting this bullish sentiment, market analyst Ali Martinez has also weighed in on XRP’s trajectory, noting that the cryptocurrency has recently broken out of a bullish flag and is now targeting the $4.40 mark.

Analyst Weighs The Facts This indicates a near-term uptrend of nearly 40% for the altcoin, complementing its impressive monthly performance, which has already seen a surge of 43%. However, despite these positive figures, XRP is currently trading at $3.16, still 7.2% below its all-time high. The price levels of $3.35 and $3.40 have proven to be significant hurdles for the altcoin, representing crucial barriers that must be overcome to initiate a price discovery phase. On the downside, the token has established a significant price support range between $2.70 and $2.80 over the past week. This area has become a notable buying zone for investors anticipating further price increases.

Stargate Finance’s token ( STG ) has bounded as high as 13% in the past 24 hours, according to data from crypto.news, the. The token is now trading hands at $0.38. However, the token has seen less than stellar numbers, plummeting by 6% in the past week and falling more than 13% in the past two weeks.

Trump announced the $500 billion ”Stargate” AI infrastructure project that will create over 100,000 jobs and improve national security. However, not all of Trump’s ventures are thriving. His meme coin, TRUMP, crashed after one of his latest press conferences, and the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) faces a number of legal challenges for alleged noncompliance with transparency and ethics laws. Trump Administration Poised to Bridge Crypto and TradFi Franklin Templeton CEO Jenny Johnson is also very optimistic about the Trump administration's potential to integrate traditional finance and cryptocurrency by establishing clearer regulations. In a Jan. 21 interview with Bloomberg , Johnson talked about just how important it is to bridge the gap between traditional finance and crypto, and mentioned that there is a big need for regulatory clarity to drive innovation and reduce costs. She believes that blockchain technology could play a pivotal role in the future, and especially in the creation of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds. She described blockchain as an efficient programming language well-suited for such applications. Jenny Johnson during her interview with Bloomberg Despite the fact that President Donald Trump signed a number of executive orders on his first day in office, none addressed cryptocurrency policy at all. This left his campaign promises of crypto-friendly measures unfulfilled for now. However, with hundreds of pro-crypto candidates securing seats in Congress, industry leaders are still hopeful that the US government could become one of the most supportive of cryptocurrency in history. Johnson acknowledged the immense potential of the crypto industry but also warned of inevitable shakeouts like the dot-com bubble . She pointed out that while some crypto ventures will fail, others could still emerge as industry leaders, similar to how the dot-com era gave rise to major tech companies despite the collapse of many others. The dot-com bubble peaked at $2.95 trillion in 2000 before sharply declining. Trump Announces Stargate Project US President Donald Trump announced a new $500 billion private-led artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure initiative called “ Stargate .” The project will build AI data centers across the United States, and receive initial investments from key stakeholders including OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle. According to Trump, the Stargate project will create over 100,000 jobs for Americans. SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son also revealed that $100 billion will be deployed immediately, while the remaining $400 billion will be distributed over the next four years. MGX, an AI investment firm, along with Microsoft, Nvidia, and Arm, were named as other major technology partners that will be involved in the project. OpenAI's Sam Altman and Oracle's Larry Ellison also appeared at the announcement, where Trump shared his determination to keep AI innovation in the US to stay ahead of competition from China and other countries. He pledged to make the initiative possible through emergency declarations. The Stargate data centers are already being constructed at Oracle’s Abilene, Texas, facility, and other locations are under evaluation. Ellison explained that Stargate would support a wide range of applications, including the advancement of healthcare through improved maintenance and analysis of electronic health records. According to OpenAI , the Stargate initiative will not only help re-industrialize the US but will also improve national security. The project is considered to be a crucial step toward the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI), with the ultimate goal of enabling advancements that could elevate humanity. Son added that the eventual emergence of Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) through Stargate could solve a number of very complex global challenges that humanity has not yet considered. Trump’s Meme Coin Crashes Although there is a lot of hope and excitement surrounding Trump’s incoming administration and new ventures, not all of them are experiencing smooth sailing. Donald Trump’s newly launched meme coin, Official Trump (TRUMP), experienced a sharp decline after the president’s admission that he actually knows very little about it. At a Jan. 21 press conference where he announced the $500 billion AI investment, Trump was asked about the token and responded, “I don’t know much about it other than I launched it, other than it was very successful.” When informed that the token made billions, Trump remarked, “That’s peanuts for these guys,” gesturing to industry leaders that were present. The token was launched on Jan. 18, and surged to an all-time high of $73.43 on Jan. 19. However, TRUMP since fell to around $41, a drop of more than 40% from its peak. People in the crypto industry criticized Trump’s lack of involvement with the meme coin. Bloomberg’s James Seyffart stated, “Trump just nuked his own meme coin.” The Kobeissi Letter also pointed out Trump’s apparent detachment from the project, and referred to the absence of public comments about it since its launch. TRUMP’s price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Adding to the token’s struggles, First Lady Melania Trump launched her own meme coin, Melania Meme ( MELANIA ), which reached a high of $13 on Jan. 20 before plummeting. For now, the crypto community is still very skeptical about the president’s meme coin, and many predict a major sell-off is on the horizon. According to Arkham Intelligence , Trump holds a crypto wallet with many large investments in meme coins, including $3.1 million worth of a token called TROG. Trump’s DOGE Department Faces Legal Backlash The newly established US Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which was also created by President Donald Trump through an executive order , is facing a series of legal challenges after his inauguration. DOGE is a temporary organization that was established to modernize government systems and address inefficiencies. It has come under scrutiny for alleged violations of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), which mandates transparency, public involvement, and ethical compliance in federal committees. The nonprofit law firm National Security Counselors filed a lawsuit against DOGE due to noncompliance with FACA. Additional legal actions were initiated by ethics watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics, consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, and the Center for Biological Diversity. (Source: doge.gov ) These organizations argue that DOGE operates without congressional authorization or funding and is led by unelected billionaires that do not represent ordinary Americans. The lawsuits also question the legality of DOGE’s designation as a government department, which is a status that typically requires congressional approval. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics was joined by other organizations, including the American Public Health Association, the American Federation of Teachers, and Minority Veterans of America. They are asking for a court ruling to ensure DOGE complies with transparency, ethics, records retention, and equal representation standards under FACA. Meanwhile, the Center for Biological Diversity demanded access to all records related to DOGE from the Office of Management and Budget. DOGE is spearheaded by Elon Musk, who proposed the idea, and was briefly co-led by former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. He resigned on Inauguration Day to pursue his Ohio governor bid.

Moving into 2025, choosing a suitable platform for one's trading needs is as relevant as ever. This article looks at three market-making companies to consider for one's trading strategies and investments. They stand out in this crowded field by ensuring seamless transactions and providing the liquidity required in a wide range of financial markets. 1. Gravity Team Gravity Team is an algorithmic crypto trading company that underscores efficiency and liquidity in crypto markets, rapidly setting the standard for crypto market makers. Its team of around 60 experts is growing in parallel with its global reach and market volume. The company has achieved a cumulative trading volume of approximately $400 billion since it was founded by a crypto-native team in 2017. It accounts for 1% of the crypto spot trading volume worldwide, is active on more than two dozen prominent crypto exchanges, and offers access to over 1,400 crypto asset pairs. However, its dominance in emerging markets is its main advantage over competitors, of whom there is no shortage. On the market-making side, large-scale projects in need of liquidity in markets they wish to enter choose this platform to gain exposure. Users can avail themselves of fiat liquidity within exotic markets. Gravity Team helps achieve equilibrium through high-frequency trading and by cooperating with various industry stakeholders. Its roles are carefully selected to contribute to this overarching goal. It works with projects in the Web3 space to market-make their coins or tokens and with CEXs to provide liquidity. Gravity Team attains its targets by leveraging innovative tools, a tightly-knit team of seasoned professionals, and extensive experience. As an ethical liquidity partner, Gravity Team mitigates risk concerns and attracts more customers to create even more liquidity. 2. Wintermute Wintermute , a global algorithmic trading platform specializing in digital assets, aims to create efficient, highly liquid markets on and off centralized and decentralized exchanges. The platform provides liquidity on dozens of exchanges and trading platforms and boasts a pronounced impact on digital asset markets. The firm improves liquidity by partnering with promising projects. It supports many highly lucrative trading pairs and cooperates with all major exchanges. Among its main advantages are 24/7/365 token liquidity, an absence of monthly or integration fees, and competitive spreads, even in the most dynamic markets. Wintermute's talented DeFi team helps bridge tokens from other blockchains to Ethereum. 3. Keyrock Highly liquid assets are behind many flourishing markets. Keyrock boosts its clients' liquidity to create fair and efficient markets and put digital assets on a promising trajectory. Its expert team and algorithms constantly scan platforms to provide additional support where needed. Their market-making algorithms ensure reliable pricing and performance monitoring around the clock. Clients receive a wide range of trading insights and statistics on demand. The market maker guarantees transparency by aggregating price data and liquidity from almost 100 exchanges. The infrastructure attracts traders through market-wide quotes. The platform facilitates trades and unifies prices, eliminating price discrepancies across markets. As a result, clients benefit from harmonized prices and tightened bid-ask spreads. A smooth trading experience is ensured, with clients readily entering and exiting trading positions. The algorithms guarantee markets can absorb an optimal number of trades, with high-volume ones becoming a trust factor at the right price. The challenges: market volatility, relentless innovation, and regulatory pressures Modern market makers face a plethora of challenges that test their flexibility, adaptability, and resilience. While market volatility creates profit opportunities, it can also lead to substantial risks. Bid-ask spreads widen during periods of high volatility, resulting in an increased risk of losing the assets one holds. The three market makers reviewed leverage advanced risk management strategies to mitigate volatility, such as dynamic pricing models that analyze real-time market conditions and adjust bid-ask spreads correspondingly. They hedge their positions and manage their inventory levels efficiently via algorithmic trading strategies. Diversification across different markets and assets is another strategy leveraged to extenuate risk. Innovation is considered a plus, with new technologies and products constantly entering financial markets. Market makers cannot stay competitive if they're not on board with this trend. They explore emerging markets, adopt bleeding-edge technologies, and develop new trading algorithms to remain relevant. They make substantial investments in research and development to foster innovation. Their teams expand to include talented developers and traders who build new algorithms and trading strategies. They also stay abreast of the latest technological advancements by collaborating with solution providers and taking part in industry consortia. Market makers embrace AI, cloud computing, and blockchain technology to enhance their operations. One final challenge involves regulatory pressures. The rules governing financial markets differ depending on the jurisdiction. Regulatory compliance entails significant expenditure, which is unavoidable as legitimate market makers realize non-compliance will result in reputational damage and even more significant fines. The reviewed market makers navigate regulatory pressures by investing in specialized legal and compliance teams. They implement sophisticated compliance software to monitor real-time transactions, ensuring all trades comply with the applicable regulations. Continuous staff training on best practices and regulatory changes also mitigates compliance risks. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

On Jan. 21, Upbit launched trading support for VeThor Token (VTHO) in both the Korean Won (KRW) and Tether ( USDT ) markets. As of Jan. 22, VTHO’s trading volume has surged by over 88,000% in the past 24 hours. According to CoinMarketCap, Upbit accounts for more than 66% of VTHO’s trading volume, with over $2.1 billion traded in just 24 hours.

However, it remains roughly 80% below its all-time high of $0.042, which was reached in August 2018. VTHO was launched in July 2018 as part of the first phase of the VeChainThor blockchain, following its initial release as an ERC-20 token in 2015. VeChainThor uses VTHO to power transactions and smart contract executions on the network.

The firm used automated self-dealing to generate fake trading volumes, misleading investors and creating a false perception of market activity. The United Arab Emirates-based company has agreed to pay $428,059 in fines and asset seizures, plead guilty to charges of market manipulation, and exit the U.S. crypto markets permanently. The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Boston announced that CLS Global’s charges stem from a 2024 federal grand jury indictment. The indictment includes allegations of conspiracy to commit market manipulation and wire fraud. Wash trading, the practice at the center of the case, involves the simultaneous buying and selling of the same asset to inflate trading volumes artificially. While the practice creates the illusion of active trading, it introduces no real market risk, misleading potential investors. The FBI played a pivotal role in exposing CLS Global’s activities through an undercover investigation. Authorities created a fake crypto business, NexFundAI, as part of the sting operation. CLS Global was hired to artificially increase trading volume for NexFundAI’s token to meet listing criteria for cryptocurrency exchanges. During mid-2024 meetings, a CLS Global employee openly admitted that the firm could generate fake trading volumes using algorithms to simulate organic market activity. Although the employee acknowledged this was wash trading, they downplayed its ethical concerns. “As a result of an FBI Boston investigation, CLS Global FZC LLC has agreed to resolve criminal charges related to cryptocurrency wash trading,” the FBI stated in a tweet. The charges are significant because CLS Global operated outside the United States but still targeted U.S. investors through its public website and promotional efforts. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also filed a separate civil enforcement action against the firm, accusing it of securities law violations. The SEC has reached a resolution with CLS Global on those charges. The penalties against CLS Global include a combination of financial restitution and a complete ban from the U.S. crypto market. This case underscores the growing scrutiny of fraudulent practices in the crypto space and the lengths authorities are willing to go to expose unethical behavior. The use of a fake crypto business as part of the FBI’s investigation highlights the seriousness of the crackdown on market manipulation in the industry. The settlement with CLS Global serves as a warning to other companies engaging in similar deceptive practices, emphasizing the consequences of attempting to undermine market integrity. As regulatory bodies like the SEC increase their focus on crypto-related activities, cases like this are likely to shape the future of compliance in the industry. By targeting high-profile cases of wash trading and fraud, U.S. authorities are signaling a commitment to protecting investors and maintaining fair market practices. The actions against CLS Global highlight the importance of transparency and ethical conduct in the rapidly evolving crypto sector.",,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|UNI|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-22 10:10:43

The congestion is believed to be caused by an unexpected surge in transactions, the actions of spam bots, and a bottleneck among block producers, resulting in delays that invalidate transaction blockhashes. Despite this, the network is showing resilience, and the price of SOL is now testing a key resistance level that has flipped into support, providing a foundation for potential price movement. Technically, Solana appears to be on the cusp of a breakout. With Solana bulls eyeing price targets nearer to $300 and Fibonacci levels indicating an upward trend, the outlook for SOL remains positive despite its recent price dip. Even with setbacks, the strong performance of the network and bullish technical indicators suggest there may be room for continued growth, potentially making Solana a strong contender in the cryptocurrency market moving forward. What’s Driving the Hype Around JetBolt? Newbie altcoin JetBolt (JBOLT) is making noise—and for good reasons. The presale performance is stellar with over 280 million tokens sold. JetBolt’s swift rise reflects the increasing demand for innovative and practical blockchain solutions. Both whales and crypto enthusiasts are drawn to JetBolt’s unique features and forward-thinking approach. A key differentiator for JetBolt is its zero-gas technology, which eliminates costly gas fees common in the crypto space. Powered by the state-of-the-art Skale network, it enables seamless, gas-free transactions, making this technology also an attractive option for Web3 applications. By implementing this ground-breaking technology, JetBolt positions itself as something to watch out for this year. JetBolt also emphasizes user accessibility and community-driven features. Its advanced Web3 wallet integrates WebAuthN and biometrics, while maintaining user control. The platform’s SocialFi-inspired staking model combines rewards with active community engagement, creating a more exciting experience for users. The ongoing presale adds further appeal, offering exclusive discounts of up to 25% via Alpha Boxes or batch token purchases. With its innovative mix of high tech, unique features and growing momentum, JetBolt is solidifying its reputation as a standout new player in the evolving crypto ecosystem. Will Toncoin Push for a Bullish Rally? Toncoin (TON) is currently priced at $4.96, reflecting a 5% drop in the last 24 hours. Despite the short-term decline, its recent inclusion in Binance Launchpool has sparked optimism among investors. Partnerships with key players like Pyth Network are further enhancing the platform’s ecosystem by improving data accessibility for developers, signaling continued bullish sentiment for Toncoin. The past year has been a milestone for Toncoin, with the token outperforming big names like Bitcoin and delivering an impressive 122.2% growth over the past twelve months. Looking ahead, the TON Foundation is focusing on game-changing updates to boost scalability, with gasless transactions being one of the most awaited innovations. Analysts remain optimistic, predicting these advancements could propel Toncoin by the end of 2025, as the platform continues to evolve. Is Cardano on the Road to Riches? Cardano (ADA), one of the leading proof-of-stake blockchain networks, is gearing up to activate its Plomin hard fork. On January 18, 2025, Input Output Global (IOG), the primary developer behind Cardano, officially approved the upgrade. Currently trading at $0.9741, ADA has seen a 1.9% increase this week, reflecting positive sentiment surrounding the announcement. The Plomin hard fork represents a major milestone, introducing new governance structures and enhanced network capabilities. Cardano’s 7-day price movement from the CoinMarketCap crypto price data platform. Veteran chart analyst Peter Brandt has highlighted both opportunities and challenges. He pointed out a descending triangle pattern in 2022 that led to a prolonged downtrend, with ADA bottoming out near $0.20 in early 2023. A double-bottom formation, a classic reversal signal, marked the end of this bearish phase and set the stage for recovery. While ADA surged past $1.20 in late 2024, it has struggled to break through resistance at that level. Brandt suggests that ADA has built a solid foundation for a potential bull market, but its ability to sustain upward momentum in future mains uncertain. Final Thoughts: Which Crypto Coins Are on Whales’ Radar? Solana, JetBolt, Toncoin, and Cardano are all gaining significant attention in the crypto world, each for their unique reasons. Solana is showing strong technical indicators, signaling potential growth despite some network congestion challenges and a recent price dip due to a wider crypto market drop. Toncoin’s recent Binance Launchpool listing and upcoming scalability upgrades have sparked optimism, while Cardano’s Plomin hard fork represents a key step toward strengthening its ecosystem, despite some resistance in price movement. Meanwhile, JetBolt, with its innovative zero-gas technology and impressive presale success, is attracting both whales and crypto enthusiasts, positioning itself as a newcomer many altcoin fans are keeping a close eye on. As these projects continue to evolve, they remain high on the radar of many whales as the market continues to undergo distinct shifts. Want to explore JetBolt’s innovative ecosystem further?

39293791,https://coinpedia.org/?p=408790,1737546101,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,Donald Trump AI Investment Drives Bullish Sentiment in Crypto: Best AI Tokens to Buy Now,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/ai-tokens-dominate-crypto-space-whats-coming-next-this-week/,"The post Donald Trump AI Investment Drives Bullish Sentiment in Crypto: Best AI Tokens to Buy Now appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency market has displayed a strong bullish recovery after experiencing a short pullback yesterday. However, with Donald Trump’s unveiling of a $500 billion AI infrastructure with Soft bank, Sam Altman’s Open AI, & Oracle, the Artificial Intelligence segment witnessed the highest short-term gains. Considering the present market sentiments, is this the right time to invest in the crypto market? We at CoinPedia have uncovered the market sentiments and possible price targets of the top AI crypto tokens. Bittensor (TAO) The 04th largest Artificial Intelligence token has experienced a bullish reversal over the past day with a trading volume of $172.79 million. Despite recording a YTD return of -5.26%, this crypto token has maintained its position in the category. TradingView: TAO/USDT The RSI indicator shows a rise toward the neutral point in the 1D time frame. However, the EMA 50/200-day record a bearish price action. This suggests a mixed sentiment for the Bittensor crypto in the market. Maintaining the price above its resistance level of $437.5 could push the TAO price toward its upper resistance level of $547 this month. However, in case of a bearish reversal, this AI token could retest its support trendline of $400 in the coming time. Wondering about the long-term price possibilities of the TAO crypto token? Read our Bittensor Price Prediction to uncover the mysteries! Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) The FET coin price has jumped 7.43% over the past 24 hours with a change of +2.59% in its intraday trading volume. With this, this AI token has regained its lost momentum and covered its YTD losses. Further, the Super Artificial Intelligence token currently holds the 46th position with a valuation of $3.144 billion. TradingView: FET/USDT The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) records a neutral action with its averages displaying a similar price action. On the other hand, the SMA indicator shows a bullish curve. This suggests an increase in the buying pressure for the altcoin in the market. If the bullish sentiment sustains, the FET price will retest its resistance level of $1.650. Conversely, if the bears outrun the bulls, the altcoin will retest its important support trendline of $1.050. Are you wondering if the Super Artificial Intelligence price will reach $10 this altcoin season? Read CoinPedia’s FET Price Prediction ! Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) The VIRTUAL price has posted a bullish price action by adding 13.38% in 24 hours with a trading volume of $223.56 million. That being said, the spike has come after a mere ~1% surge in 7 days and 8.71% over the past month. With a market cap of $1.868 billion, it has secured the 60th position. TradingView: VIRTUAL/USDT The Relative Strength Index (RSI) witnessed a bullish convergence in the daily time frame. Moreover, the EMA 50-days constantly supports the Virtuals Protocol price chart. This suggests a strong bullish outlook for the altcoin this week. Suppose, the market favors the bulls, under such a situation, the VIRTUAL price will prepare to retest its upper resistance level of $4.410. On the contrary, if the bearish sentiment intensifies, this could pull the price of this AI token toward its support of $2.050. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In a recent notice , Binance Futures announced that it will be adjusting the margin tiers and leverages for a number of its USDT ( USDT )-margined and coin-margined perpetual contract, specifically for TRUMPUSDT, LITUSDT, DOGSUSDT and NEIROETHUSDT. The adjustments will come into effect starting from Jan. 22, 2025 at 16:00 ET. However, the exchange guaranteed that user’s current positions will not be affected by the change. The TRUMP ( TRUMP ) perpetual contract was previously launched on Jan. 18 at 13:00 UTC with a maximum leverage of up to 25x for traders. With the new adjustments, Binance is offering traders a maximum leverage of up to 50x, double its previous rate. However, Binance has also lowered its margin rate from 2.00% to 1.00% and trimming all other margin rates above it by at least 50% or more. Margin rates affect users based on their current positions. Therefore, a user with a position from zero to 5,000 would be trading with a 1.00% margin instead of 2.00%. Whereas, users in higher position, from 1.5 million to 3 million, previously trading under the 50% margin will now trade under a 12.50% margin. According to crypto.news data , the official Trump meme coin has gone up by more than 5% in the past 24 hours. TRUMP is currently trading hands at $41.68. You might also like: MELANIA coin price spikes over 75% after Binance boost Unlike TRUMPUSDT, the maximum leverage for USDT-based perpetual contract for the Litentry token has been cut from 25x to 10x. Most of the margin rate for LITUSDT remains unchanged, except for the positions within the 25.00% margin rate. The 25.00% margin rate used to apply to users in position up to 550,000. Now it has been lowered to the 520,000 position. Therefore, users in a higher position than 520,000 but under or equal to 550,000 fall under the 50.00% margin rate. The USDT-based perpetual contract for First Neiro on Ethereum also went through a maximum leverage adjustment. Binance Futures has trimmed its leverage from 25x to 15x. While most of the margin rates for NEIROETHUSDT remain the same, the 25.00% margin rate now applies to users on the position range of 500,000 up to 700,000 instead of the 1 million position. Instead, Binance has added a margin rate of 50.00% for positions ranging from above 700,000 up to 1 million. For the WLD perpetual contract, the maximum leverage for WLDUSD has been cut by half, from 20x to 10x. Despite this, the margin rates for WLDUSD positions remain unchanged. However, the maximum position for the 50.00% margin rate has been changed from 1 million to just 600,000. The same can be said about the coin-margined DOGSUSD, which appear to have kept its initial maximum leverage and margin rate.

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has apologized for the Solana delays caused by the exchange’s infrastructure issues, which left users dealing with canceled or slow transactions. In a post on X on Jan. 22, Armstrong admitted that the platform has the Solana backlog “triaged,” adding that transactions “should generate quickly again.” For users who suffered losses or missed out on the hype due to hours-long disruptions in depositing or withdrawing Solana ( SOL ) tokens, Armstrong issued his “apologies for the trouble.” “We have the Solana backlog triaged, and transactions should generate quickly again. If your transaction got canceled you can retry it now – apologies for the trouble.” Brian Armstrong He admitted Coinbase needs to do better when it comes to supporting Solana, saying “it’s clear we need to step up our game on Solana, scale our infrastructure, and provide native support for common use cases like DEX/memecoin trading.” Armstrong also promised to give Solana the same top-level support as Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), and Base, though he didn’t go into specifics.

One user, @PAGANDWOLF, pointed out that the exchange “had many years to fix these problems, including issues from last bull markets when volume is high.” The latest incident , tied to Solana’s surge in activity, seems to have overwhelmed the platform’s systems. Armstrong noted that the increased traffic is a good thing for Solana but admitted the exchange needs to handle it better. “The surge in activity is great for the ecosystem (and these are high quality problems to have), but we need to do a better job serving our customers during periods of high demand,” he said.

Analysts have turned bullish on Solana once again, predicting that the layer-1 network will rocket to $1,000 in 2025. Despite the surge, even SOL holders are flocking to PropiChain (PCHAIN) due to its AI-driven real estate features. The project has raised over $2 million during the presale, setting the stage for major gains when it gets listed on secondary. Is PCHAIN, an AI altcoin, the dark horse of the 2025 bull market? Solana Hits New ATH, $1K on the Horizon Solana experienced a significant surge to reach a new peak of $293 following the launch of a Donald Trump-branded meme coin. The layer-1 network hit $293 before surrendering some of its gains. Solana is trading at $274.34, indicating a 44.4% growth in a week.

The Solana surge has coincided with an optimism for a new era of regulatory clarity in crypto. Analysts are projecting that Solana will reach $1K in 2025.

33767162,[object Object],1737546705,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Whales Buy LDO & AAVE, This DAO Token Could Be the Next 10X Crypto",https://bitcoinist.com/whales-buy-ldo-aave-this-dao-token-could-surge-10x/,"While retail investors are buzzing about AI and meme coins, whales stack up on DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) tokens like Lido DAO ($LDO) and Aave ($AAVE). Yesterday, a whale bought 2.72M $LDO, bringing their total holdings to 5.565M tokens. With the current price of $1.90 per token, this amounts to roughly $10.5M. In response, $LDO jumped 8% and hit $1.96 but has since dropped to $1.90. Still, the whale earned a 4% profit as the token’s price was $1.82 at the time of purchase. Whales Like WLFI Bet Big On DAO Token AAVE $AAVE whales have also been unusually active lately. One whale transferred $750K worth of $AAVE to cold storage, which suggests a long-term investment strategy and a strong belief in the project’s future. Another $AAVE investor cashed out $11.3M in total profits over the past two days as the token’s price grew by 25%. However, they still hold 28K $AAVE with over $7M in unrealized gains. Even Trump’s World Liberty Financial bought $4.7M worth of $AAVE , which puts it in the top six assets in the company’s portfolio, right after $ETH, $USDC, $WBTC, $STETH, $USDT, and $TRX. The DAO token sector market cap now stands at $40B, a 2% increase in the past 24 hours. Uniswap ($UNI) still dominates the niche with a $7.9B market cap, but $AAVE is quickly gaining ground with a $5.4B market cap. It’s easy to see why whales choose DAOs. Investing in DAO tokens gives them influence over the project’s trajectory, so they can potentially secure greater profits – for themselves and everyone else. Besides, decentralization, transparency, and democracy are the very ethos of Web3. Whales recognize that community-driven projects drive the evolution of finance and technology. Last Chance to Join the Flock & Reap Rewards One early-stage DAO with massive potential is Flockerz ($FLOCK) , ‘the people’s meme coin.’ Flockerz is technically a DAO, so the core concept isn’t new, but it introduces a unique V2E system where members earn rewards for voting on development proposals. No other DAO gives extra tokens for engagement. Apart from governance rights, the $FLOCK token gives its holders 249% staking APY and access to the Flocktopia community. As one of the best meme coins , the project has raised nearly $12.5M on presale, which is set to end in two hours. This is the last chance to join Flocktopia before $FLOCK spreads its wings and soars to new heights. Any DAO’s success hinges on the loyalty of its members, so Flockerz allocates a substantial 25% of the total token supply to staking yields and another 25% for voting rewards. These incentives encourage early birds to stick around for the long flight. Early Bird Gets the Worm Whale interest in DAOs demonstrates that power is shifting from corporations to the public. The future of finance is community-centric, and each single one of us can support this revolution by joining projects like Flockerz, which could explode after its presale ends . To the flock, before it takes off, visit the Flockerz website , connect your wallet, and exchange $ETH or $USDT for $FLOCK. However, remember to DYOR, and don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Even projects with strong fundamentals don’t guarantee returns.",Crypto News,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-01-22 11:51:45

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-options-on-chicago-mercantile-exchange-cme-hit-highest-level-since-us-election-here-are-the-details/,"Bitcoin (BTC) options on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) have reached their highest levels since the November 2024 US presidential election, signaling growing optimism among investors. CME Bitcoin Options Hit Highest Gains Since US Election Amid ETF Inflows Renewed inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are further fueling expectations of new price highs for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. On Tuesday, CME's bitcoin options market showed increasing bullish sentiment as investors flocked to purchase call option derivatives that offer the potential for asymmetric upside exposure. The 30-day peak curve, a measure of the difference in volatility between bid and ask, reached 4.4%, its highest level since early November, according to CF Benchmarks data. “This reflects strong bullish sentiment, with traders actively taking bullish positions in both the short and long term,” said Thomas Erdösi, product manager at CF Benchmarks. Bitcoin Price Surpasses $106K Bitcoin’s price rose 5% to briefly surpass $106,000 after buyers successfully defended the $100,000 support level. The rally came despite President Donald Trump's inaugural speech on Monday in which he made no mention of cryptocurrency or Bitcoin as part of the strategic reserve. The rally was fueled by renewed demand for U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs, which saw cumulative net inflows of $802 million on Tuesday. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF led the way, drawing $661.8 million, according to SoSoValue data. “ETF inflows continued an impressive accumulation streak, marking four consecutive days of significant inflows exceeding $3 billion for Bitcoin alone,” said Valentin Fournier, an analyst at BRN. “This strong institutional support could push digital assets to new highs.” Ethereum (ETH) spot ETFs also recorded $74 million in inflows on the same day, underscoring strong investor interest in the broader crypto market. *This is not investment advice.

With a recent resurge in BTC, which rallied above $105k, igniting a broader cryptocurrency market rebound. This uptick has stirred optimism, especially as major investors accumulate an additional 140 Million of ADA. Could this be the spark that propels the ADA price to $1.5? Cardano Price Consolidates The Cardano price consolidates after failing to maintain support above the $1 critical level. ADA has struggled after rallying past the $1.15 resistance mark, dropping 4% over the past 7 days. However, the price rebounded slightly today as the broader crypto market showed signs of recovery. As of Wednesday, the ADA price is trading at $0.9804, with a slight surge of 1% in the past 24-hours. The leading crypto, Bitcoin, remains above $105K , but many coins are still struggling to regain lost ground. Market sentiment remains cautious following Monday’s inauguration of Donald Trump as the 47th president of the U.S., which has influenced financial markets. Traders are watching for further price action as ADA navigates key resistance and support levels in the coming days. Whales Accumulate 140M ADA Tokens The accumulation of 140 million ADA tokens by large holders between Dec. 15, 2024, and Jan. 22, 2025, signals growing confidence in Cardano. Whale activity often influences market trends, potentially driving prices higher.

As Solana rides this bullish wave, market participants are questioning whether SOL can sustain its current price or if a correction is imminent. As Solana aims to solidify its position, JetBolt (JBOLT) jumps ahead with groundbreaking zero-gas technology. With its presale surpassing 200 million tokens sold, JetBolt is quickly emerging as a strong contender in the fast-evolving cryptocurrency market. Will Solana maintain its bullish momentum, or is a market pullback inevitable? And how will JetBolt’s zero-gas innovation reshape blockchain adoption? Let’s dive deeper into Solana’s price prospects and JetBolt’s unstoppable momentum. Solana Price Prediction: Can SOL Sustain Its Current Price? Solana is currently trading at $256.55, reflecting strong upward momentum with a 39.52% increase in price over the past 30 days. The question now is whether Solana can sustain this growth or if a correction is on the horizon. Recent market activity indicates solid buying interest, with Solana topping trading charts and attracting significant institutional attention. Large-scale transactions and increasing total value locked (TVL) suggest that confidence in Solana’s ecosystem remains high. The launch of high-profile tokens on the network has further fueled demand, positioning Solana as a top-performing blockchain in the current market cycle. Solana (SOL)’s buying activity data in 24 hours (as posted by @martypartymusic on X) Despite these positive indicators, technical analysis points to key resistance levels that could challenge further price appreciation. Solana’s recent surge past critical support levels is encouraging, but maintaining momentum above these thresholds will be crucial. Some analysts caution that if selling pressure increases, a retest of lower support levels could occur. Overall, Solana’s ability to sustain its current price will depend on continued demand, favorable market conditions, and its capacity to maintain dominance in decentralized finance, meme coin, and NFT sectors. The coming weeks will be pivotal in determining whether SOL can push to new highs or face a period of consolidation. JetBolt Jumps Ahead with Unstoppable Momentum While Solana pushes forward with impressive gains, another rising contender is making headlines in the crypto space— JetBolt (JBOLT). With its presale already surpassing over 200 million tokens sold, JetBolt is rapidly carving out its place as a next-generation altcoin featuring practical solutions that cater to both developers and users alike. JetBolt’s main draw is its use of zero-gas technology, which eliminates gas fees entirely. Built on the Skale network, this feature ensures cost-efficient blockchain interactions, allowing users to carry out on-chain transactions and actions without gas costs. As Solana continues to attract attention with its scalability, JetBolt is addressing a different pain point—accessibility—by lowering one of the major barriers that often deter new entrants to the blockchain space. In addition to its zero-gas framework, JetBolt’s SocialFi staking model is revolutionizing the way users engage. Beyond the usual staking rewards, JetBolt introduces an engaging way for users to boost their token earnings by combining staking with interacting with others on the platform. JetBolt’s presale success is also fueled by its exclusive Alpha Boxes , offering early purchasers up to 25% in extra tokens when purchasing in batches. JetBolt’s unique blend of high tech features, novel utility, and trending dynamism have contributed to the rapidly growing excitement around this next-generation newcomer As JetBolt jumps ahead with fresh momentum, crypto enthusiasts are seizing the opportunity to get in on the action ahead of JetBolt’s presale next 24-hour price increase. Can Solana Sustain Its Current Price As JetBolt Jumps Ahead? With the ongoing developments in Web3, altcoins like Solana and JetBolt demonstrate how blockchain innovation is expanding in multiple directions—one focusing on speed and network growth, the other on user accessibility and making gas a thing of the past. With momentum building and key milestones already achieved, JetBolt is positioning itself as a serious contender in the crypto race, displaying an ecosystem that combines cutting-edge technology with user-friendly solutions.

An in-depth on-chain analysis revealed the wallet’s origins in the Philippines, despite its initial portrayal as a legitimate source tied to major institutions like Bank of America and JPMorgan. This incident underscores the dangers of misinformation and the role of social media platforms in amplifying fraud within the cryptocurrency space. How fraudsters exploited blockchain’s transparency On January 22, influencer accounts on X (formerly Twitter) began circulating claims about an XRP wallet purportedly connected to the US Treasury. The wallet’s KYC verification and supposed links to reputable financial entities lent it a veneer of authenticity, which scammers leveraged to deceive the crypto community. Source: Crypto.news Using XRPSCAN, investigators determined that the wallet, identified as ‘rfHhX6hA54LBqA3j7r7EnCs6qyaRK2Lyfq,’ was a fraudulent operation originating in the Philippines. Scammers relied on blockchain’s inherent transparency to give the appearance of legitimacy. Public records on XRP’s ledger allowed them to manipulate narratives, presenting routine transactions as evidence of official backing. These tactics were bolstered by the involvement of high-profile influencers, whose reposts amplified misinformation across the platform. Misinformation on X fuels crypto scams The role of misinformation in enabling scams is not new, but the decentralised nature of crypto amplifies its effects. Claims tied to the XRP wallet gained traction through crypto influencers. The broader crypto landscape is no stranger to scams. Scam Sniffer reported an 87% spike in daily impersonation accounts on X in December 2024, rising from 160 in November to over 300.

Recent incidents include hijacked accounts of Lenovo India and Yahoo News UK, which were repurposed to promote scam tokens, resulting in significant financial losses. The need for vigilance and regulatory intervention This case underscores the urgent need for enhanced vigilance and regulatory measures to curb crypto scams. The exploitation of blockchain’s transparency, combined with misinformation on social media, creates a dangerous ecosystem where fraud can proliferate. Beyond individual losses, such incidents erode trust in blockchain technology, potentially stalling its broader adoption. Users must adopt proactive measures, such as verifying wallet addresses and relying on credible sources for information. Regulatory bodies, meanwhile, face growing pressure to implement frameworks that balance innovation with consumer protection. As scams become more sophisticated, leveraging tools like on-chain analysis could play a pivotal role in identifying fraudulent activities before they escalate.

Pundits have long said regulatory clarity could pave the way for further price appreciation. Gold's price rebound from December lows has also gathered pace and is now just 1% shy of setting new highs above $2,790 per ounce. That's unusual: Bitcoin typically rallies when the price of gold stagnates. Perhaps gold is saying the Fed will walk back on its hawkish December bias that signaled fewer rate cuts, helping keep BTC bid. And why not? Reports indicate that Trump's tariffs will be lighter than anticipated and research from MacroMicro shows that their inflationary impact during his previous presidency was minimal. In the broader crypto market, on-chain data from IntoTheBlock reveals that 80% of addresses holding LINK, one of the recent top performers, are in profit at the going market rate of $25.70. Key resistance levels have been identified at $27 and $29, which acted as barriers last year. The movement of XRP, another recent outperformer, between addresses owned by whales and centralized exchanges has slowed considerably from the record levels earlier this month. That may be a sign these large holders have slowed their profit-taking activity. Meanwhile, traders are expressing enthusiasm with sentiments like ""we are so back,"" especially after Bloomberg's James Seyffart shared filings for ETF applications involving coins including LTC, SOL, DOGE, XRP and others. It seems the momentum in both the crypto and traditional markets could be setting the stage for an exciting period ahead. Stay alert!

Since then, BTC has dropped 4.54% and currently trades around $104,965. With the short-term outlook uncertain due to the recent choppy movement, let’s look at BTC dominance and what that means for the long-term outlook of Bitcoin price. Bitcoin Price Today Bitcoin price today trades at No data found for bitcoin on 21 minutes ago after dropping No data found for bitcoin on 21 minutes ago% in the past 24 hours. Despite this short-term pullback, BTC is up 3.54% this week and is still above the $100K psychological support level. But the dominance of BTC is at a key level and hints that the next phase of the bull run will be lead to exponential rallies. *bitcoin price updated as of No data found for bitcoin on 21 minutes ago What is BTC Dominance? Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of BTC and total crypto market capitalizations. Currently, this metric stands at around 60%. Generally, a spike in dominance is attributed to capital flowing into BTC, which often happens at the start of the bull. During this phase, Bitcoin price explodes quite a bit while a majority of the crypto market sectors remain without growth. At a certain point during the cycle, BTC’s uptrend hits a ceiling, leading to profit-taking and capital rotation. This diversification from investors leads to capital flowing to more risky assets such as altcoins or meme coins. When this happens, BTC’s uptrend slows down or corrects while the rest of the crypto markets explode. This phase is termed “alt season,” where the rest of the crypto market undergoes massive expansion. BTC Dominance How Does Droppin Dominance Affect Bitcoin Price? Since its inception, Bitcoin’s dominance has been dropping with each cycle, producing lower highs. The first major collapse in BTC’s market share happened in early 2017. During this ICO mania of 2017, many altcoins yielded multiple 100x returns. Despite this, Bitcoin’s price shot from nearly $2000 to $20,000. The second drop in dominance occurred in late 2020 and early 2021, when the DeFi-based altcoins saw parabolic rallies. In the next year, Bitcoin prices exploded from $20,000 to $69,000. During both these drops, Bitcoin exhibited similar price action fractals – a steady down-trending consolidation followed by a breakout and an up-trending consolidation. After these two signals were spotted, the value of BTC increased exponentially while dominance dropped. History is repeating itself according to analyst TechDev . For most of 2024’s second half, Bitcoin’s price consolidated in a downtrending channel. A breakout from this range led to new highs. Following this, BTC’s price is ranging again but inside an up-trending channel, suggesting that an exponential rally is next. Bitcoin Price Vs. BTC Dominance With such an optimistic Bitcoin price prediction , let’s look at key levels to buy BTC ahead of its parabolic rally. Key Levels to Watch if Parabolic Rally Kickstarts The key support levels for Bitcoin include $100K, $96.6K, $95.3K and $93.2K. Investors can consider buying BTC if the price dips to this level. As noted in previous articles, the next all-time high for Bitcoin could be $120,000 , which is the 161.8% Fiboancci extension level of the recently formed range. Beyond this, many banks in the US expect Bitcoin to form a top anywhere between $150K to $200K in 2025. For example, Standard Chartered is looking at a peak of $250,000 in 2025. CMT Analyst Adrian Zduńczyk is a firm believer that the next ATH for BTC could happen at $225,000. The $150K to $200K range is a good place to book profits if Bitcoin price enters this range.

One such project, the Hyperliquid (HYPE) token, recently launched directly on its own decentralized order book. By bypassing centralized exchanges, this approach prioritizes a community-first model, setting a new precedent for token launches. In parallel, the PEPE coin price has climbed 6.67%, reinforcing its strong position in the market. Analysts suggest the coin could achieve further gains if it breaks key resistance levels, signaling continued bullish potential. At the same time, BlockDAG (BDAG) is making waves in its presale journey. The addition of Marius Bock, a former Cardano leader, as the new Lead Project Manager appears to be a game-changer. With BlockDAG’s presale surpassing $183 million. Bock’s expertise is expected to drive the project closer to its ambitious $600 million target. Under his guidance, BlockDAG is well-positioned to become a top decentralized blockchain solution. Hyperliquid (HYPE) Token Reinvents Crypto Launches The Hyperliquid (HYPE) token’s decentralized launch marks a significant departure from traditional token introductions. Unlike most projects, which debut on centralized exchanges with allocations for venture capital firms, HYPE launched independently via its own protocol-based order book. By excluding venture capitalists and early investors, this approach prioritizes a fairer, community-focused distribution. Vitali Dervoed, CEO of Composability Labs, called it a step toward decentralized crypto ecosystems and more equitable on-chain launches. PEPE Coin Price Gains Upward Momentum PEPE coin’s price recently increased by 6.67%, reinforcing its position in the meme coin market, which boasts a $107 billion market cap. On the 4-hour chart, bullish signals emerge as it bounces off support levels and crosses key Fibonacci retracements. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted a potential rise to $0.000021, contingent on breaking a symmetrical triangle pattern. The next resistance at $0.0000225 could signal further gains, while failure to maintain support at $0.00001739 might prompt bearish movement. BlockDAG Welcomes Marius Bock as Presale Reaches $183M! BlockDAG (BDAG) has added a major industry figure to its team as part of its mission to deliver scalable blockchain solutions. The project’s presale, which has raised $183 million, got a major boost with the appointment of Marius Bock, former Cardano leader, as Lead Project Manager. With over 25 years of blockchain and fintech experience, Bock played a pivotal role at Cardano, advancing its wallet development and hardware wallet integrations with Ledger and Trezor. His expertise extends to leadership roles at Fundamo, a Visa company, and contributions to projects with IBM and ACI Worldwide. At BlockDAG, Bock is expected to accelerate the presale’s momentum toward its $600 million target and guide the network’s 2025 mainnet launch. Analysts predict BDAG, currently priced at $0.0248 in batch 27, could hit $1 by year-end, delivering a potential 3932% ROI for early adopters. With a track record of 2380% ROI since its first batch, BlockDAG is establishing itself as a leading name in decentralized blockchain technology. The presale’s success reflects strong backing from its innovative team and growing buyer interest, positioning BDAG as one of the best crypto coins for the future . Identifying the Best Crypto For The Future? The Hyperliquid (HYPE) token’s decentralized launch represents a shift toward community-driven crypto distributions, potentially setting a new industry standard. Meanwhile, the PEPE coin price continues its bullish trend, supported by technical patterns and key market movements. However, BlockDAG leads the pack with its $183 million presale milestone, upcoming mainnet launch, and Marius Bock’s strategic leadership. With BDAG poised to reach $1 in 2025, analysts anticipate significant returns for early adopters. Its innovative solutions and strong growth potential make BlockDAG a compelling contender for traders seeking the best crypto for the future.

A Ripple millionaire who made $11 million from the recent rally in the XRP price has placed a significant bet on DTX Exchange (DTX), positioning it as a new rival to Cardano (ADA). He said DTX Exchange's hybrid platform is transforming the trading landscape and is poised to outperform traditional exchanges. With the presale still ongoing, let’s examine why DTX Exchange may be a more prospective investment option than even the leading giants like Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA). XRP Price Consolidates Near ATH In the last few months, Ripple has dominated the market with massive price swings. In the previous 30 days, the XRP price surged 36.52%, reaching a recent high of $3.40. From 4th January, the XRP price formed a bull flag-like pattern, which broke out on 11th January, maintaining its momentum, and reaching a new ATH after 7 years. Source: CoinMarketCap However, during the last two days of market volatility, the XRP price has retraced near the 10-SMA and is still searching for support. Currently, it trades at $3.06 and has a trading volume of $19.09 billion. Technical analysis shows that the next barrier for the XRP price is at $3.40, and if it succeeds in overcoming it, a bullish breakout toward $4 and above may occur. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that Ripple whales wasted no time taking advantage of the slight weekend discount, buying up 100 million Ripple (XRP) tokens. This continuous accumulation and optimism about regulation have strengthened the XRP price, which might continue in the coming weeks. Cardano (ADA) Falls 7.45% Intraday Since profit booking started in the market, Cardano (ADA) has lost nearly 8% of its market cap in just 24 hours. It faced rejection near the previous high made on 7th January and has decreased by 18% from the same. Cardano (ADA) is currently hovering above 50–SMA, and the continuation phase may continue for a few weeks. Cardano (ADA) recently made it to CoinMarketCap's new list of ""Made in America"" digital assets. Adding to the positive momentum, Cardano (ADA) is expanding its presence in Argentina. The plans include developing a social security benefits system, managing union records, collaborating with the Buenos Aires Technological University, and creating a student identity tracking system. DTX Exchange: The Rising Star In the Trading World The crypto market is opening a new chapter as DTX Exchange (DTX) attracts attention from big players like whales and institutional investors. The platform plans to rapidly expand its market share in the $100 trillion trading market. DTX is a new-generation hybrid exchange that blends the strengths of centralized and decentralized exchanges. DTX Exchange is powered by the Layer-1 VulcanX blockchain, which eliminates the inefficiencies of traditional exchanges with lightning speed and enhanced scalability. The blockchain performed tremendously in the testnet, resulting in 100,000 TPS. Community is the backbone of any crypto project, and the DTX Exchange ecosystem has been developed with community members in mind. The VIP Rebate Program allows users to earn passive income through a 3% share of the exchange's fee revenue. Moreover, members can use the DTX staking feature for up to 56% APY. DTX Exchange is committed to democratizing investors' participation through its fair launch system. Currently priced at just $0.14 in its presale, the DTX token has achieved over 12 million in sales. The remarkable success of the presale signifies investors' confidence in the company’s future prospects. Analysts believe after the mainnet launch, the DTX token could surge 30x within a few months. For those who want to enter the bull story of the crypto market, the constantly growing DTX is the token that should be kept in your portfolio.

Crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted that Ripple whales quickly seized the opportunity during a brief weekend dip, purchasing 100 million XRP tokens. This ongoing accumulation, combined with optimism over regulation, has bolstered XRP's price, which may continue to rise in the weeks ahead. Cardano (ADA) Declines 7.45% in a Day As profit-taking began across the market, Cardano (ADA) saw its market cap drop by nearly 8% in just 24 hours. It faced resistance near the previous high from January 7th and has fallen 18% since then.

Despite this significant gap, analysts believe that the potential for a robust price recovery exists in the coming weeks and months ahead of the new year. Cardano Consolidates Above Key Moving Averages, Poised For Breakout Trend Rider, a prominent analyst on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), provided insights on Cardano’s current price action, noting that the price dipped below the parabolic line, indicating a cooling-off period, which occurred just above the $1 mark last week. However, he emphasized that the Cardano price is consolidating above its moving averages, suggesting it is preparing for a potential breakout while “shaking out weaker hands.” Related Reading: World Liberty Financial Raises $1B: Trump-Backed Crypto Venture To Extend Token Sales Trend Rider further anticipates a resumption of bullish momentum soon, forecasting that once the Cardano price breaks through the $1.25 resistance level, it could rapidly surge toward the $3 mark, inching closer to its previous record peak. Adding to the optimistic outlook, analyst Ali Martinez pointed out that after experiencing a 44% correction, Cardano began its second leg up during the week of February 1, 2021. Given that ADA has already undergone a 43% correction recently, the analyst suggests that the next upward movement for ADA could be just two to three weeks away, with a target of $6 in sight. Analysts Identify Key Support And Price Targets Another analyst, AV Sebastian, also weighed in, suggesting that the price recent dip may be over, and that the Cardano price is poised to break out of a triangular pattern. He highlighted the last two candles as particularly bullish and expects a significant rally in the coming days. In analyzing short-term price actions, several analysts noted that ADA is exhibiting a “very bullish market structure” on the daily timeframe. On the chart is observed a double bottom formation leading to a breakout and a V-shaped recovery along a descending channel. Related Reading: Big Players Bet Big On XRP, Solana With Excitement Around Donald Trump’s Presidency, Here Are The Figures It is further believed that a retest of the key support zone at $1.3886 appears inevitable for ADA’s price in the near-term, which would then lead to price uptrend with a main target of $1.7748. Further support zones have also been identified, with the $0.824 level being crucial to watch early in 2025. Holding this support could unlock significant upside potential, and analysts are eyeing May 2025 as a key timeframe for achieving targets. At the time of writing, ADA was trading at $1.14, up 1.13% for the 24-hour period.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As 2025 unfolds, analysts are tipping Yeti Ouro as a breakout star, with predictions that it could hit $1 before established meme coins like Shiba Inu or Dogecoin. Table of Contents Yeti Ouro to be this year’s breakout star Shiba Inu coin forecast With the new year comes new expectations, and in the ever-changing world of crypto, this calls for investors to adjust their portfolios and target the tokens that will outperform in the market. One of the analyst favorites for 2025 is the utility memecoin Yeti Ouro (YETIO), which some say will hit $1 before Shiba Inu, Dogecoin or Pepe coin. Yeti Ouro to be this year’s breakout star After a record-breaking 2024, the crypto market is expected to have another highlight year in 2025, boosted by the coming-to-power of Donald Trump. And while the purely speculative meme coins are expected to shoot up in the early days of the Trump presidency, the gains will be shortlived, and utility cryptos will have their day in the sun. One of the leading contenders for this year is YETIO, the native token of the Yeti Ouro ecosystem. YETIO has already built an ecosystem in its presale, which has attracted thousands of investors, selling more than 128 million tokens. The tokens have already shot up more than 40% from their price in the first stage of the presale and are now selling at $0.017, with analysts projecting that it will hit $1 this year. With only a billion tokens in maximum supply, and with 5% allocated to the token-burning mechanism, YETIO is better positioned to maintain its gains over the long term than most meme coins. YETIO’s utility comes from Yeti Go, the play-to-earn racing game that tests players’ skills, use of strategy and quick reflexes. Developed by avid gamers, in partnership with gaming titans involved in the development of iconic titles like Call of Duty, Spiderman, The Witcher, and Dead Space (to name just a few), Yeti Go offers a thrilling and immersive experience that caters to newbies and experienced gamers. The Yeti Ouro team has shared a video showcasing the first glance of the Level 1 map of Yeti Go game.

In the past week, one of the reasons behind its downturn has been the emergence of TRUMP, the new memecoin launched by the new president, which surged to a market cap of $15 billion on Sunday, just a day after Trump announced it on Truth Social. Analysts note that a lot of liquidity that was caught up in speculative meme coins flowed to the new project in anticipation of the inauguration. However, in Shiba Inu, the burn rate picked up at the start of the week, surging nearly 1,000% on Monday. Shiba Inu price is currently trending at $0.00002113 on Coinmarketcap, showing a 4.7% increase in the past 24 hours.

The top economy official said that the EU is ready to defend its economic interests and will respond proportionately. Trump’s administration continues to threaten the European Union with tariffs as protectionist trade initiatives for the U.S. economy. However, Valdis Dombrovskis, the European Union’s commissioner for the Economy, told CNBC that the EU is ready to initiate retaliatory actions against Trump’s proposed tariffs on imports from the region. Dombrovskis emphasized that the EU will defend its values, rights, and interests whenever necessary. Trump threatens to impose tariffs on European Union exports coming to the U.S. Since Trump assumed office on January 20, he has continuously threatened to impose tariffs on U.S. imports from the EU region. Trump has told reporters that Europe is “ very, very bad” to the U.S. and will, therefore, face tariffs as a way for the U.S. to gain fairness. In 2023, the EU exported an excess of 502 billion euros worth ($522 billion) of goods to America. According to data from the European Commission, importing volumes exceeded 340 billion euros, resulting in a surplus. In my first interview at @WEF #Davos2025 with @CNBC I highlighted why trade tariffs should be avoided and emphasised that democracies – particularly the EU🇪🇺 and US🇺🇸 – should work together. ➡️ Watch the interview here: https://t.co/3YhmMrxbJ1 pic.twitter.com/f2WX5RdPK4 — Valdis Dombrovskis (@VDombrovskis) January 22, 2025 Dombrovskis explained that the U.S. and Europe are strategic allies, and it is vital for the two regions to work together geopolitically and economically. He also said that European officials are in talks with their U.S. counterparts to find a sensible solution to the discussion of tariffs. He noted that global growth could go to its knees if the economic relationship between the two nations were destroyed. “It’s important to maintain this trade and investment relationship because this global economic fragmentation would set in, and there is a real risk of this happening, and the IMF estimates that it would mean a reduction of the world GDP by up to 7%.” -Dombrovskis, European Union’s Commissioner for the Economy According to the European Commission website, the EU and the U.S. have the largest bilateral trade and investment relationships, and the two regions boast the most integrated economic relationship worldwide. Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez cautions against Trump’s proposed tariffs on the EU Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez stated that the European Union is not interested in a trade war. He explained that the European Union shares a strong transatlantic bond and that a trade war is a “zero-sum gain” for both parties. He also mentioned that the two regions need to focus on strengthening their transatlantic relationship, which, according to him, is the most important issue. Trump also made statements on Tuesday about imposing an additional 10% tariff on Chinese exports to the U.S. starting February 1. During his presidential campaign last year, the U.S. president threatened to impose up to 60% tariffs on goods coming from China. According to Trump, China is the main supplier of fentanyl to U.S. neighbors and, therefore, responsible for the ongoing addiction crisis in the country. Trump invited Chinese President Xi Jinping to his inauguration, attended by his deputy, Han Zheng. Manoj Kewalramani, chairperson of the Indo-Pacific Research Programme, postulated that Trump and Xi would continue to engage as Biden and Xi did despite the Biden administration’s existing restrictions on China. Trump is accusing China of unfair trade practices. However, Chinese exports to U.S. companies rose toward the end of 2024 despite the existing tariff threat. The exports grew by 4% between November 2023 and November 2024. Trump also threatened to impose 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, claiming that the countries were allowing a large number of people and fentanyl into the country. According to Kewalramani, Trump intends to use tariffs as a vital tool for international trade and economic negotiations.

(Santiment),https://cryptopotato.com/is-ethereums-weak-performance-a-reason-to-worry-or-an-opportunity-in-disguise-santiment/,"The current bull market has seen top alternative cryptocurrencies, except Ethereum, shine, and now, ETH holders are becoming frustrated. Market sentiment signals extreme negativity among the Ethereum community, and the crypto project’s slumping market cap growth is not helping matters. Compared to other assets like Ripple (XRP) and Solana (SOL), whose market capitalizations have grown by 36.9% and 32.2% in the past month, ETH has been struggling and even recorded a 4.7% decline. Factors Driving ETH Underperformance A new report by the market intelligence platform Santiment analyzed factors driving Ethereum’s underperformance. According to the analysis, the crypto community has been criticizing Buterin for periodically selling off large amounts of ETH. Although the Ethereum co-founder has explained severally that those sales were executed to fund personal expenses or support projects related to the blockchain, community members see them as a sign that he may not be confident in the network’s future. On several occasions, Buterin’s ETH sales have triggered multi-week-long sell-offs among traders amid heightened concerns about Ethereum’s future and decentralization. Some market participants insist that Buterin, a few big players, and the Ethereum Foundation have too much control over the network because of their large ETH holdings. These players include Coinbase, Binance, and Lido Finance, and their influence has raised centralization concerns among users. Additionally, users are worried about Ethereum following government rules in some cases, such as blocking transactions to the crypto mixer Tornado Cash. A Good Sign? From a more technological perspective, some analysts believe Ethereum’s underperformance could also be linked to its decision to go modular. Modularization in this context refers to Ethereum splitting its responsibilities across smaller, specialized projects called layer-2 solutions. While going modular could have a positive impact on Ethereum in the long term, ETH is struggling currently because these layer-2 solutions are taking away some of the attention and investment that used to go to the cryptocurrency. One illustration of this issue is the ETH supply spiking significantly after the Dencun upgrade because transaction fees declined, and less ETH got burned. Regardless of these factors, Santiment believes that the extremely negative social side of Ethereum is a good sign for the short-term future of ETH because the market often moves in the opposite direction from general investor sentiment. So, ETH could finally break past the $4,000 range in the coming weeks if retail traders remain bearish and sell off their coins to long-term holders and key stakeholders out of frustration.

Ross Ulbricht Freed From Prison President Donald Trump has officially signed an executive order to commute the sentence of the founder of the darknet Silk Road marketplace. “I just called the mother of Ross William Ulbright to let her know that in honor of her and the Libertarian Movement, which supported me so strongly, it was my pleasure to have just signed a full and unconditional pardon of her son, Ross,” Trump wrote in a Jan. 21 post on his Truth Social platform. The president slammed the prosecutors involved, calling Ulbricht’s sentence of 40 years plus two life sentences “ridiculous.” Ulbricht operated Silk Road, a large-scale marketplace that used Bitcoin for payments, from 2011 to 2013, using the nickname Dread Pirate Roberts. He was arrested in 2013 and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole in 2015 for his role in creating and running the platform. After Silk Road was shut down, U.S. authorities confiscated roughly 174,000 BTC from wallets associated with the marketplace. The government has since auctioned off most of the BTC. Freeing Ulbricht was one of Trump’s many promises to the cryptocurrency community on the campaign trail, with the president pledging to pardon the Silk Road creator on day one of office if reelected. “Words cannot express how grateful we are,” the family’s Free Ross campaign account said on X. “President Trump is a man of his word and he just saved Ross’s life. ROSS IS A FREE MAN!!!!!” Why Bitcoiners Advocated Strongly For Ulbricht’s Release Crypto fans have long petitioned for Ulbricht’s release for several reasons. Some argued that it was disproportionately harsh and he didn’t deserve to rot in jail for creating a darknet market where users freely sold narcotics and other illegal products and services. Other crypto enthusiasts have described him as a Bitcoin legend due to his early contributions to the Bitcoin market. Notably, Silk Road was one of the first peer-to-peer exchanges to accept Bitcoin, popularizing the use of the alpha crypto. “I owe everything to Ross Ulbricht. Crypto changed my life. Crypto became big because of him. He made the ultimate sacrifice. We all benefited from his work.” OG Bitcoin developer Amir Taaki quipped on X. Trump’s other notable crypto-related campaign promises included creating a national Bitcoin strategic reserve, appointing a more crypto-friendly Securities and Exchange Commission chairman, and transforming the U.S. into the crypto capital of the planet.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|MARKET|EXCHANGE|FIAT,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-22 12:12:17

Tokens like $Trump and $Melania exemplify this trend, capitalizing on political and cultural identities to capture broad interest. In contrast, projects such as Lightchain AI , though not meme coins, focus on real-world applications, offering a different kind of appeal. Raising $12.3 million during its presale with tokens priced at $0.005625, Lightchain AI is establishing itself as a serious contender amid the meme coin excitement. Let's delve into what meme coins are, how they operate, and how they stand against utility-focused tokens like Lightchain AI. Defining Meme Coins Meme coins are digital currencies created primarily for entertainment, often tied to internet jokes, cultural trends, or public figures. Unlike major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, meme coins generally lack strong utility or technology backing. Their value is largely influenced by community interest, social media hype, and celebrity endorsements. Tokens such as $Trump and $Melania draw on their connections to former U.S. President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump. These coins attract specific communities, fostering a sense of identity and belonging among holders. While they can lead to quick, substantial gains, their long-term value often hinges on maintaining community engagement rather than intrinsic worth. The Mechanics of Meme Coins Meme coins operate on blockchain networks and utilize smart contracts for their functionalities. Usually launched on platforms like Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain, they are accessible to a wide audience. Meme coins often have very low prices, enabling investors to purchase significant amounts with small investments. Their growth is predominantly driven by the community, relying heavily on the strength and participation of their supporters. Marketing and hype are crucial to their success, with social media campaigns, influencer endorsements, and viral trends fueling interest and trading activity. However, meme coins are highly speculative investments, and their prices can be extremely volatile. Investors should approach them with caution, being aware of the risks associated with their unpredictable value. Lightchain AI: A Utility-Centric Alternative While meme coins like $Trump and $Melania thrive on excitement, Lightchain AI offers a fundamentally different approach. The platform merges artificial intelligence with blockchain technology to tackle real-world problems. A standout feature of Lightchain AI is its developer-friendly environment, which offers tools for creating decentralized AI applications targeted at specific industries. Lightchain AI also emphasizes privacy and scalability, ensuring its solutions meet the requirements of businesses handling sensitive information. These qualities distinguish it from meme coins, making it appealing to investors looking for long-term value and practical applications. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Let’s explore what meme coins are, how they work, and how they compare to utility-focused tokens like Lightchain AI. What Are Meme Coins? Meme coins are digital money made mostly for fun, often linked to online jokes, cultural fads, or famous people. Unlike normal digital͏ money like Bitcoin or Ethereum meme coins usually have no strong use or tech behind them Their worth mainly comes from what the community cares about, social media buzz and celebrity backing. Tokens such as $Trump and $Melania use their links to the old U.S. Leader Donald Trump and First Lady Melania trump. These coins attract certain groups of people, making a feeling of identity and fitting in among their owners. While they can see huge quick profits, their long-term worth often relies on keeping the group involved instead of real value. How Meme Coins Work Meme coins are cryptocurrencies that function on blockchain networks and use smart contracts for their operations. Typically launched on platforms like Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain, they are accessible to a broad audience. Meme coins are often priced very low, allowing investors to buy large quantities with minimal investment. Their growth is largely community-driven, relying on the strength and engagement of their followers. Marketing and hype play a significant role in their popularity, with social media campaigns, influencer endorsements, and viral trends driving interest and trading activity. However, meme coins are highly speculative investments, and their prices can be extremely volatile. Investors should approach them cautiously, understanding the risks involved in their ever-changing value. Lightchain AI Utility-Focused Alternative While meme coins like $Trump and $Melania thrive on hype, Lightchain AI represents a fundamentally different approach. The platform integrates artificial intelligence with blockchain technology to address real-world challenges. A notable feature of Lightchain AI is its developer-friendly ecosystem, which provides tools for building decentralized AI applications tailored to specific industries.

While $26 billion in user-to-user crypto remittances is still only a fraction of the global remittance market, Teng is optimistic that this volume will continue to grow as people recognize how the headaches of traditional finance can be addressed by crypto. Global remittances are expected to grow to an estimated $913 billion in 2025, and are a lifeline for millions of families worldwide. However, traditional remittance channels very often impose high fees. In fact, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) noticed costs as steep as 15-20% for low-value transfers. In comparison, Binance Pay offers instant, fee-free transactions that dramatically reduces costs and financial strain for its users. According to The World Bank , the global average cost of sending fiat remittances is 6.65%. By switching to crypto-based remittances, Binance users collectively saved billions in fees that would otherwise be lost to financial intermediaries. The platform’s average international remittance amount in 2024 stood at $470, which proves just how economically accessible the platform is to people from all around the globe. Remittance price worldwide quarterly report (Source: The World Bank ) The Real-Life Impact of Remittance Costs According to Teng “for migrant workers and families in need, the ability to stretch earnings further can make all the difference, turning crypto into a vital lifeline.” In other words, the power of crypto remittances extends far beyond cost savings. Algerian user Imed shared a compelling story of how Binance Pay made it possible for him to transfer funds instantly for life-saving medical treatment for a family friend in France. ”The difference isn’t just monetary,” he explained. ”It’s about saving lives and providing support when it matters most.” Binance Pay is a contactless, borderless, and secure crypto payment technology that is designed by Binance. It allows users to pay, send, and receive payments in more than 300 cryptos from friends and family around the world. Floods in Brazil (Source: Binance ) Diogo Mury from Brazil used Binance Pay to distribute emergency relief funds during the devastating Rio Grande do Sul floods. His ability to send immediate aid helped victims to buy essential supplies without waiting days for traditional banking systems to process international transfers. As adoption grows, crypto’s role in international remittances could completely redefine how money moves across borders.

This phenomenon underscores the profitability of contrarian trading strategies, where savvy investors capitalize on crowd sentiment by buying when retail investors sell and vice versa.

Conversely, high retail optimism about higher prices often signals that whales are offloading their holdings, leading to downward pressure.

In other words, it is the expected value miners can expect from 1 TH/s of hashing power per day. According to Glassnode, hashprice is hovering above $62 PH/s, around the highest level since mid-December. What's driving the increase in hashprice? Well bitcoin (BTC) has surged to well over $100,000, a 56% increase in three months and has given the miners some relief. The network has also seen a slight increase in miner fees of late, roughly 12 BTC per day, the highest amount for over a month, partly driven by the network's inscription activity. Due to the halving in April 2024, where the mining rewards get cut in half, the hashprice had dropped from around $115 PH/s. As a result of the halving, miners struggled in share price appreciation on average last year; while mining revenue for much of 2024 was below the rolling 365-simple moving average (SMA). Only since November has it reclaimed this moving average, which is a historically bullish signal. While the hash rate, the computational power in order to mine on a proof-of-work blockchain, recently hit all-time highs, as a result sent the network difficulty to all-time highs, which eats into mining profitability, as it becomes harder for miners to receive rewards. European head of research at Bitwise, Andre Dragosch, told CoinDesk exclusively about miners being in a healthier position than last year. ""We have recently seen a decline in network hash rate since the all-time highs in early January. Meanwhile, the price of bitcoin has increased, and the overall transaction count has picked up again. This has led to a recovery in hash price, which should technically incentivize miners to continue ramping up their hash rate"". Dragosch says, ""overall, bitcoin miners appear to be well capitalized judging by the continued increase in bitcoin miner holdings since the beginning of the year which implies that miners are selling less than they are mining on a daily basis"".",Markets|Bitcoin|Miner Revenue,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MINING|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-22 12:21:05

Notably, the exchange’s CEO, Brian Armstrong, revealed that the transaction glitch on the network was fixed. Further, efforts to prevent such issues ahead were also underway. As a result, the crypto exchange giant now eyes increased support for the network, mirroring the same level offered to Bitcoin and Ether. Coinbase CEO Reveals Tier 1 Support Underway In an X post by Brian Armstrong dated January 22, the Coinbase CEO revealed that the crypto exchange is aiming to provide “tier 1 support for Solana, with the same level of support as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Base.” This statement indicated that after recent withdrawal issues faced by users on the crypto exchange, efforts to prevent such events in the future were in the pipeline. Notably, Armstrong stated, “It’s clear we need to step up our game on Solana, scale our infrastructure, and provide native support for common use cases like DEX/memecoin trading.” Although, the CEO’s statements underscored that although the crypto trading platform is currently unable to tackle the surge in activity, a positive outlook for users lies ahead. SOL Transaction Glitch Fixed: Coinbase CEO Meanwhile, the Coinbase CEO has also revealed that the exchange has “the Solana backlog triaged, and transactions should generate quickly again.” This statement comes against the backdrop of a SOL withdrawal halt, wherein leading crypto exchanges Coinbase and Binance halted withdrawals for the crypto amid high withdrawal volumes. In turn, some traders remain unhappy due to the loss incurred amid the network glitch, whilst others look to withdraw funds as the issue is fixed amid a broader crypto market recovery. SOL Price Surges Over 7% As of press time, SOL price pumped nearly 7.5% intraday and is sitting at $257.48. The coin’s 24-hour low and high were $236.36 and $259.83, respectively. Intriguingly, the crypto’s rising trajectory in tandem with the transaction trouble fix, as revealed by the Coinbase CEO, has ignited significant investor enthusiasm. Moreover, the current pump also mirrors the broader crypto market trend, as mentioned above. Also, it’s worth mentioning that the Solana network saw a huge surge in activity amid the meme coins TRUMP and MELANIA’s recent launch, a potential reason why withdrawal volumes on Coinbase surged. In light of this activity surge, a recent SOL price analysis by CoinGape revealed that the token may experience significant growth ahead. In turn, crypto market watchers continue to eye the token with bullish long-term prospects amid recent developments.

What This Means for Altcoins A prolonged Bitcoin Season can have mixed implications for altcoins: Limited Short-Term Gains : Altcoins may struggle to deliver significant returns.

Monitor Altcoin Opportunities : Identify promising altcoins that may be undervalued. Diversify with Stablecoins : Use stablecoins to hedge against market volatility. Conclusion The Altcoin Season Index’s steady reading of 43 confirms that the cryptocurrency market is firmly in Bitcoin Season , with altcoins facing stiff competition from Bitcoin’s dominance. While this signals limited short-term opportunities for altcoins, it also presents a chance for investors to position themselves strategically for the next market cycle.

Over time, four tokens exemplified by Rexas Finance (RXS), MANTRA (OM), Cardano (ADA), and Ripple (XRP) showcase the best likelihood to amass considerable returns from relatively small investments before the year 2025 wraps up. The unique offerings of each token make them worth serious consideration for investors. Rexas Finance (RXS): Pioneering Real-World Asset Tokenization Making things accessible to the masses is at the heart of Rexas Finance, as seen in the tokenization of real estate through blockchain. By enabling users to buy lower percentage shares of traditionally expensive assets, Rexas Finance undoubtedly stands out. Their emphasis on the platform's security, transparency, and accessibility is unmatched. Thanks to the success of the Rexas Finance presale, over $41.5 million has been raised alongside 424 million tokens sold. As stage 11 sold out before the schedule, stage 12, owing to the result of votes by the community, has been introduced. It is currently set for $0.200, with the token set to list at $0.25 on June 19, 2025. Experts anticipate RXS climbing to $5 by Q3 2025. Investor confidence has increased due to its community-driven marketing strategies and approach to tokenizing real-world assets. This is evident from the $1 million giveaway, in which 20 winners receive $50,000 worth of RXS tokens each. MANTRA (OM): Making Waves in the Market Mantra has invested heavily in expanding its platform, which provides users with a comprehensive list of decentralized finance services. It trades at $3.76 while holding a market capitalization of $3.61 billion. This firm has positioned itself as essential for any DeFi user. With a shift from traditional finance to innovative DeFi solutions, analysts predict a bullish market across the capital. Focusing on community initiatives is promising. By 2025, MANTRA is projected to trade within the $12 to $15 range. Even reaching a whopping $20 is plausible during the bullish run. The projection remains clear due to strong polymers in other DeFi projects alongside steady adoption. From an investment standpoint, adopting MANTRA simplifies risks while strengthening returns. OM solves issues through an appealing, low-risk, and unique governance model while increasing community incorporation. Cardano (ADA): A Sustainable Blockchain with Great Capabilities Investment and retailer trust is shifting towards ADA because it has become one of crypto's most innovative and secure blockchains due to AI-driven resources and scalability functionality. Currently, it stands at $1.06 with a $37.31 billion market cap. This signals trust and attention from all major players in the financial market. In the past few months, whales have accumulated over 30 million tokens, making big bets on Cardano. Veteran trader Peter Brandt asserts that ADA has bottomed, signaling the start of a grand bull market. Analysts forecast that in 2025, ADA will reach the $5 mark, with strong potential to increase if key sectors like smart contracts and decentralized applications become more widely adopted. In an era where sustainability is gaining significant attention, Cardano stands out due to its relative energy consumption while providing an advanced level of performance. For long-term investors, there is potential to harness the power of this blockchain with ADA. Ripple (XRP): Leader in Cross-Border Payment Technology The XRP token is often portrayed as an efficient and cost-effective transaction method worldwide. Valued at $3.17 and with a market cap of $182 billion, XRP is gaining momentum. Analysts believe Ripple may strengthen its relations with other players in the industry, ensure regulatory compliance, and set indicators that the price of XRP will soar to $10. Ripple pioneered building blockchain payment networks and other existing infrastructures, which paved the way for the XRP token to break international boundaries into the mainstream economy. Ripple's consolidation with legal entities further increased investor confidence in trading, and now, the technology allows for cheap transactions around the globe. Conclusion Investing $600 in these tokens guarantees a strong base encompassing Rexas Finance, MANTRA, Cardano, and Ripple. Together, these companies pave the way for a smart way to spend across the many specialties of asset tokenization, cross-border payment, and blockchain technology that reduces carbon emissions and innovation in DeFi. Each token is excellently positioned to ensure that these evolving trends pay off in transformative ways that ripple across the economy. Of these, Rexas Finance is a leader in innovative tokenizing of real-world assets, which is set to boom. With strong community support, successful presale results, and a clear roadmap, RXS is poised to become the best investment for those looking to transform small amounts of money into significant wealth.

Long-term investors can leverage ADA's potential for significant blockchain advancements.

Now, many say this is a big move in the crypto world. The launch marks the first instance of a high-profile political figure first time a person in power has a crypto coin to their name. Table of Contents What is TRUMP coin? Inside the TRUMP coin: key details and criticisms Official Trump price prediction: overall outlook Official Trump price prediction 2025-2030 What is TRUMP coin? $TRUMP is a meme coin launched on the Solana blockchain with the official backing of U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump was initially not a fan of the crypto industry, famously referring to Bitcoin as a scam against the dollar in 2021. Trump has since embraced crypto. One day after his coin’s launch, on January 19, 2025, the price of the Official Trump ( $TRUMP ) meme coin reached an all-time high of $75.35, but then collapsed on January 20 after the launch of the president’s wife’s meme coin , $MELANIA.

Is Official Trump a good investment? What risks are associated with the coin, and does the cryptocurrency have a future? Let’s try to find out from our Official Trump price prediction. Inside the TRUMP coin: key details and criticisms The TRUMP token is built on the Solana blockchain. This crypto project is supported by CIC Digital LLC and Fight Fight Fight LLC, subsidiaries of The Trump Organization, which together control 80% of the token’s supply. “My NEW Official Trump Meme is HERE! It’s time to celebrate everything we stand for: WINNING!” – Trump wrote on his X profile when announcing the meme coin on the evening of January 17. My NEW Official Trump Meme is HERE! It’s time to celebrate everything we stand for: WINNING! Join my very special Trump Community. GET YOUR $TRUMP NOW. Go to https://t.co/GX3ZxT5xyq — Have Fun! pic.twitter.com/flIKYyfBrC — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 18, 2025 On launch day, 200 million $TRUMP coins were made available to users, with the total supply expected to increase to 1 billion over the next three years. The official website of the meme coin contains a disclaimer stating that it “is not intended to be, or to be the subject of, an investment opportunity, investment contract, or security of any type,” “is not political,” and “has nothing to do with any political campaign or any political office or governmental agency.” Some experts have already accused Trump of profiting off his presidency in this way. Trump owning 80% and timing the launch just hours before the inauguration is viewed as predatory by some, potentially leading to a price collapse. There’s a way to spin it that way, but it’s unclear if that’s the direction it will go. Right now, it’s looking like an FTX coin,” said Nick Tomaino, a venture crypto investor, in his X post . So, what will be the future of the $TRUMP coin? How high can Official Trump go? These are tough questions to answer. Let’s take a look at the $TRUMP crypto price prediction for 2025 and beyond. Official Trump price prediction: overall outlook At the moment, the $TRUMP token is fluctuating a lot. There’s a chance it could drop even more, and that might result in losses for some investors. But once the hype dies down, we’ll get a much clearer idea of what it’s really worth. A lot of the price action will depend on what moves Trump makes as president and how the major investors react to it. It’s possible the Trump coin is just another product of the hype machine around his name. So, if you’re keeping an eye on the Official Trump price prediction, don’t be surprised if things get rocky along the way. Official Trump price prediction 2025-2030 Long-term $TRUMP coin price predictions are pretty limited, but here are the projections we’ve come across: According to CoinCodex’s $TRUMP price prediction for 2025, the coin could see wild values ranging from $39.4 to $190. This signals room for growth but also acknowledges the market’s inherent fluctuations. BTCDirect , a European platform, expects $TRUMP to steadily rise, but they predict it could end 2025 at €28.01, which is lower than its current value. CoinCodex’s Official Trump price prediction 2030 promises us growth, with estimates landing between $105 and $168. Based on these predictions, the expectations for the $TRUMP coin’s future seem positive, but how things play out will ultimately depend on the market. Donald Trump knows how to surprise, and what will happen with his meme coin next—hopefully, we’ll find out soon.

This article will explore several projects trading below $0.10 that are primed for explosive breakouts. In the meme coin niche, Pepe (PEPE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Bonk (BONK) are teasing massive gains, while newer projects like Elluminex (ELX) are also catching the attention of market players looking for the next big opportunity. Why Elluminex Is A DeFi Game-Changer Elluminex is emerging as a revolutionary DEX built on the Toncoin blockchain. Its all-in-one DeFi platform is set to challenge established protocols like Uniswap that are typically inefficient when it comes to cross-chain transactions. Elluminex offers a seamless, user-friendly experience that integrates key functionalities such as efficient liquidity management and low slippage, and its cross-chain bridge allows users to swap assets between different blockchains quickly, all while maintaining complete anonymity, as no KYC is required to join. The $ELX token plays a key role within the Elluminex ecosystem, powering transactions, governance, and other incentives. With a deflationary design and a capped total supply of 350 million tokens, $ELX is poised for sustainable long-term growth. Half of the token supply will be made available at a discounted rate during the presale, giving early adopters a unique opportunity to join the platform before its full launch. Holders will be eligible for up to 18% APY in the form of recurring staking rewards. Additionally, Elluminex will offer exclusive early access to TON-based project tokens before they are listed on other exchanges through a special over-the-counter platform, providing further incentives for users to engage with the ecosystem. As the bull market heats up in 2025, a perfect storm scenario is shaping up for Elluminex, and crypto players who take action today could be in for incredible returns as the cycle progresses. Pepe Hinges On Support As Short-Term Price Structure Breaks Down Pepe (PEPE) experienced a significant dip of nearly 30% after the launch of Donald Trump’s meme coin siphoned liquidity from the rest of the market. Pepe’s bullish momentum was derailed, as it plunged below $0.000015 for the first time since November. Pepe has since rebounded slightly, recording a 2.5% daily upsurge, and is currently trading for $0.000016. However, the sentiment around Pepe is generally bearish, as technical indicators suggest sustained selling pressure. Pepe’s daily RSI is currently sitting at 42 points, indicating the possibility of further downside, and whale sell-offs have further added uncertainty. On the other hand, Pepe’s Open Interest rose by 5.4%, and now it stands at $81 million, as the Pepe community remains hopeful for a recovery. Shiba Inu Rebounds 5%, Lead Dev Teases New Updates Shiba Inu has recovered by 5%, reclaiming the $0.000021 level and recouping most of its weekly losses. Shiba Inu lead developer Shytoshi Kusama recently teased significant upcoming updates for the Shiba Inu ecosystem, sparking a 3% price increase. Kusama talked about the market’s attention shifting toward meme coins with real utility, creating anticipation around Shiba Inu and its ecosystem tokens like BONE, LEASH, and TREAT. He also confidently compared Shiba Inu’s potential to blockchains like Solana, suggesting upcoming technological advancements that could drive up Shiba Inu’s price in 2025. Bonk Explodes By 15% As ETF Rumors Gain Traction Firms REXShares and Osprey have filed for new crypto ETFs with the SEC, including unexpected entries focused on meme coins like Bonk (BONK), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Trump (TRUM). This move signals a shift toward mainstream acceptance of meme coins like Bonk as legitimate investment products. Bonk is now a potential candidate for a potential ETF release, which could drive significant institutional interest and propel its price to new heights. While the SEC’s approval is still pending, the proposed Bonk ETF marks a notable moment in the evolution of crypto-based investment products. Although approval is not guaranteed, Bonk enthusiasts rushed to “buy the rumor”, resulting in a 15% green candle on the daily timeframe, with the Bonk price jumping to $0.000035. Discover The Elluminex Presale Stage 1 of the Elluminex presale is now live and demand is growing exponentially. Early bidders have already claimed nearly 5 million $ELX, raising close to $300,000 in funds in record time. Tokens are selling at an alluring price of only $0.06, making this the perfect entry point for savvy traders who want to capitalize on the Elluminex revolution.

In a long post from the X account, Justin Sun wrote that if Ethereum and the Ethereum Foundation were managed by him, he could take Ethereum (ETH) to $10,000. Sun also listed what he will do for the Ethereum Foundation and ETH, and wrote that his first job in the first week will be to stop ETH sales. Sun outlined four main actions he would take if he were to run the Ethereum Foundation: “Immediately stop ETH sales and optimize revenue, impose heavy taxes on layer-2 solutions, simplify the Ethereum Foundation's operations, and adjust rewards and fee burns.” “The Ethereum Foundation will immediately cease selling ETH for at least three years. Operational costs will be covered through AAVE lending, staking returns, and stablecoin borrowing. This ensures that the ETH supply remains intact, aligns with our deflationary goals, and strengthens market confidence. Significant taxes will be imposed on all Layer 2 projects, ensuring that Ethereum generates at least $5 billion in taxes per year. All taxes collected will be used to buy back ETH and burn it in a completely decentralized manner. ….” Justin Sun stated that with the changes and plans he proposed, all resources will be devoted to Ethereum reaching $10,000 by prioritizing scalability, security, and adoption. At this point, Sun added that if these steps are taken, he expects the ETH price to exceed $4,500 within the first week and lay the foundations for its long-term success.

The current sentiment is neutral, with predictions pointing to higher price growth. What can we expect from GRT price analysis next?

In that year the price will range between $0.978 and $1.12. WIll GRT reach $2? Per the analysts’ price predictions, it remains unlikely that GRT will get to $10 before 2031. WIll GRT reach $100? Considering GRT’s current price and market cap, it remains highly unlikely that it will reach $100 in the next ten years. Does GRT have a good long-term future? According to the market assumptions, GRT is set to trade higher in years to come. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory.

DigitalCoinPrice expects that MELANIA’s price could climb to $21.32 or $24.29 by the end of 2030. Telegaon predicts that by 2030, the MELANIA token could range between $276.49 and $348.55. Before trusting any source that is trying to predict Melania coin’s price prediction for 2030, you should understand that it is a meme token in a crypto world that is highly volatile. This means that no one knows if this meme coin can survive the next five years as there have been many instances where crypto tokens have lost their entire value while some are clear cases of rug pull. You should also note that, unlike other crypto tokens, meme coins experience higher volatility and this can cause big price fluctuations in its price.

Before investing in any cryptocurrency including the MELANA token, please identify and understand the inherent risks that can come due to market volatility. Also, it should be noted that meme coins, in general, are a highly speculative investment, and their success not only relies on market volatility but also on the constant and sustainable growth of its community. Hence it is advisable to do your research on the token’s fundamentals which may very well decide the future of the MELANIA token. Will Melania coin go up or down from its current price? Meme coins in general experience rapid price swings that are directly driven by market sentiments, community engagement, events like token burns, and so on. While it is hard to determine how high the MELANIA token will go, it is important to look out for potential buying factors that may include new partnerships, increased token holders, or viral campaigns in general. It is also vital that you rely on financial experts who give realistic forecasts, and still, you should remain cautious as no one can accurately predict how high meme coins can go. How to buy Melania coin? MELANIA token can be bought through decentralized exchanges and also on many centralized exchanges which include Binance, Mexc, Bybit, and many others. You should consider the fees and other risks associated with centralized or decentralized exchanges before making your buying decision.",Predictions|Meme Coin|politics,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|EXCHANGE|BNB|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-01-22 13:50:51

Solana (SOL): A Scalable Blockchain Platform for Decentralized Applications Solana is a blockchain platform focused on scalability, providing a foundation for decentralized applications (dapps) alongside competitors like Ethereum and Cardano. It distinguishes itself with architectural choices aimed at faster transactions and flexible development options across multiple programming languages. By avoiding sharding or second-layer solutions, Solana offers a high-capacity network designed to host high-activity products and services, appealing to developers seeking efficient and scalable solutions. SOL is the native cryptocurrency of the Solana ecosystem and is central to its operation. It facilitates transactions, powers custom programs, and rewards network supporters. The coin holds value as it underpins the ecosystem, allowing users access to a suite of projects built on the platform. The potential of SOL and its technology is linked to Solana’s ability to deliver scalable blockchain solutions, which may influence its role in the current market cycle. Cardano (ADA): A Scalable and Sustainable Blockchain Platform Cardano is a blockchain platform designed to run smart contracts, enabling developers to create decentralized finance applications, crypto tokens, and games. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, allows users to store value, make payments, and participate in staking on the Cardano network. Cardano is notable for its environmentally friendly approach, utilizing the Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, which is more energy-efficient compared to traditional proof-of-work models. The platform’s architecture is divided into two layers: the Settlement Layer for transactions and the Computing Layer for smart contract operations. This design enhances scalability, potentially allowing the network to process up to a million transactions per second. The introduction of native tokens in March 2021 improved security and efficiency in smart contract interactions. The attractiveness of ADA in the current market cycle depends on various factors, including market trends and individual investment objectives. Investing in cryptocurrencies involves risks due to price volatility, so it is important to conduct thorough research or consult a financial advisor before making investment decisions. Conclusion While Solana and Cardano perform well, XYZVerse’s unique sports-meme fusion and ambitious growth targets position it to outshine them in the current bull run.

According to Cloakd , he has already waited more than 28 days to get feedback from the Phantom security team on whether they have fixed the vulnerability, but there has been no update. He said: “I’ve been waiting for over 28 days for a large vulnerability to be fixed in one of the largest apps on SOL. At this point, it’s becoming a joke – I can’t even get a response from their security team at this point in terms of update.” Following Cloakd’s post, the Phantom official account responded on X, stating that security is its priority and has investigated the vulnerability report. The team claimed that the vulnerability did not affect users’ funds and that there was no cause for alarm. It wrote: “We have investigated your report and have a different perspective on its severity. We believe it does NOT make user funds vulnerable in any way.” Community unimpressed with vague response However, Cloakd disagreed with this statement, noting that the vulnerability directly risks users’ funds. In response to some users who asked what they should do, he advised them to safely store their private key and move the funds to another wallet because Phantom clearly does not care about security. Others in the crypto community also criticized the response, noting that the wallet provider did not provide any clarity on what steps it had taken to address the vulnerability or whether it even fixed the issue. Although Cloakd did not specify the vulnerability, the security expert noted that it is within the Phantom app itself, and safely storing the private key should be enough to secure assets in the wallet. Meanwhile, another security expert, Andy from Solana-based Taptrade, joined in countering Phantom’s statements about its security. He claimed that his team had also reported several bugs to the wallet provider’s team in the past, with the wallet provider failing to respond to any message about potential vulnerabilities in its application. Phantom soars as TRUMP puts the spotlight on Solana The concerns about Phantom wallet security are coming at the wrong time for the crypto wallet, given that it has been enjoying some increased adoption due to the TRUMP token launch. Phantom is currently ranked number 2 in the utility app charts for the UK and the US App Store. It ranks higher than Coinbase on the App Store charts in the US. Phantom’s historic run has been due to Trump-related memecoins, which attracted millions of retail users to the Solana network and wallet installations. In the 24 hours after TRUMP launched, Phantom reported processing 10 million transactions with a trading volume of $1.25 billion. Meanwhile, the wallet also recently completed a Series C funding, raising $150 million to take its valuation to $3 billion. This represents a 150% markup on its last valuation in 2022, when it was worth $1.2 billion, highlighting how it has seen substantial growth along with the Solana ecosystem.

Calamos Investments introduced protected Bitcoin ETFs offering downside risk mitigation and capped upside potential, and Bitcoin is still a hot topic with predictions suggesting the crypto king will target $122K soon. Staked Ether ETFs Edge Closer to Approval Staked Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could be right around the corner as issuers are increasingly optimistic about regulatory approval in the near future. Consensys founder and Ethereum co-creator Joe Lubin recently shared his insights into the ongoing discussions with ETF providers in an interview , and revealed that they expect a green light for staked Ether ETFs ”reasonably soon.” According to Lubin, these issuers are already working hard to address the complexities associated with staking and slashing to deliver robust and diversified solutions for investors. Lubin sees these efforts as a positive sign for the Ethereum ecosystem, and he believes they will drive technological advancements and attract a more diverse client base. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot Ether ETFs last year, and nine products launched in July. While these funds trailed behind their Bitcoin counterparts in performance, they were still able to achieve a cumulative inflow of about $2.7 billion. However, staked Ether ETFs are still unapproved, but industry experts suggest that this could change under the SEC's new leadership. The morale in the crypto industry received a nice boost after the SEC announced on Jan. 21 that it will form a crypto task force focused on developing a regulatory framework for digital assets. The task force is led by Commissioner Hester Peirce, who is very well known for her crypto-friendly stance. In a December interview, Peirce hinted at a potential shift in the SEC, and stated that a change in perspective among Commissioners could pave the way for the approval of products like staked Ether ETFs. Former Polygon financial chief Young Ko fully supports Peirce’s leadership because of her understanding of blockchain technology and her advocacy for crypto innovation. Ko pointed out that Peirce publicly endorsed the idea of ETFs staking for yield, and believes her role will be a huge benefit to the Ethereum ecosystem. Bernstein Research also recently projected that approval for ETH staking yield ETFs is likely under the SEC’s new pro-crypto leadership. Meme Coin ETFs Also Await Approval Staked Ether ETFs are not the only new ETFs in town. Asset managers Osprey Funds and REX Shares filed regulatory documents to launch ETFs focused on meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE), Official Trump (TRUMP), and Bonk (BONK). ETF filing (Source: SEC ) These proposed ETFs will also include cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and XRP, and will directly hold spot assets as well as related financial derivatives. According to the filing, the funds plan to allocate at least 80% of their assets to their respective reference cryptocurrencies under normal market conditions. The REX-Osprey TRUMP ETF will be the first ETF to feature the TRUMP meme coin that was launched on Jan. 18. The meme coin is endorsed by US President Donald Trump, and it quickly achieved an $80 billion fully-diluted valuation (FDV) before stabilizing. Its launch caused an investor frenzy, and even overwhelmed the Solana network for several days. Moonshot, the platform that was referred by Trump for purchasing the token, reported more than 200,000 new on-chain users since the token's debut. US regulators appear to be moving towards a more favorable stance on crypto oversight, particularly after Trump’s electoral victory and his commitment to establish the US as a global crypto hub. This shift encouraged a number of asset managers to submit filings for ETFs holding altcoins like Solana, XRP, and Litecoin, along with diversified crypto index funds. Calamos Launches Protected Bitcoin ETFs Calamos Investments introduced a series of innovative protected Bitcoin ETFs that are designed to offer investors exposure to Bitcoin while mitigating volatility risks. The first of these ETFs, CBOJ, debuted on Jan. 20 and provides 100% downside protection with a capped upside ranging from 10% to 11.5% over a one-year period. Two additional funds, CBXJ and CBTJ, are slated for launch on Feb. 4. They offer 90% and 80% downside protection, respectively. Each ETF has a structured framework combining US Treasuries and options on Bitcoin index derivatives to deliver regulated access to Bitcoin returns with built-in risk management. In an interview with CNBC , the head of ETFs at Calamos Matt Kaufman talked about Bitcoin’s potential role as a hedge against inflation, and placed a lot of emphasis on just how important these kinds of financial instruments are in the current economic climate. Matt Kaufman Investors in the CBOJ ETF can expect an upside return of 10% to 11.5% while benefiting from complete protection against price declines within a one-year outcome period. The forthcoming CBXJ and CBTJ ETFs, while not offering 100% downside protection, present way higher upside caps of 28%–31% and 50%–55%, respectively, making them very attractive options for those willing to accept a slightly higher risk profile. According to a company statement , the protective design of these ETFs provide regulated, risk-managed Bitcoin exposure through a transparent and tax-efficient structure without counterparty credit risk. Kaufman also recently noticed an increase in crypto-related ETF filings. He is excited about the incoming pro-crypto economic environment, and believes that now is the best moment to establish Bitcoin reserves. Analysts Predict Bitcoin Rally to $122K Bitcoin could see a 10+% price increase from its current levels within the next few days, followed by a potential consolidation phase, according to Markus Thielen , head of research at 10x Research. Thielen pointed out that Bitcoin successfully retested its wedge breakout, rebounding from $98,937 to over $107,000 on Jan. 21. He believes this breakout signals a “low-risk, high-reward entry opportunity.” BTC’s wedge breakout (Source: 10x Research ) According to Thielen, Bitcoin’s recent price movement provides traders with an opportunity to set stop-losses at $98,000 to minimise risk while capitalizing on the potential for upside. He pointed out that since the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the US a year ago, Bitcoin has shown a pattern of rising in $16,000 to $18,000 increments. This now suggests a possible climb to $122,000 by February before entering a consolidation phase. Bitfinex analysts seem to agree with Thielen’s bullish outlook, thanks to Bitcoin’s strong recovery and its impressive resilience compared to the stock market. Thielen added that if the current pattern holds, Bitcoin could surpass $122,000 and later retest this level as support. He also shared that breaking past $106,000 is a signal for the continuation of Bitcoin’s upward trend. Keith Alan , co-founder of Material Indicators, supported this analysis due to the breakout from a cup-and-handle pattern on the Bitcoin weekly chart. Alan also predicted that Bitcoin could reach $122,000.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|REGULATION|ZRX|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-22 13:57:20

Table of Contents Bitcoin’s short-term price prediction Bitcoin price: latest news FAQs In this article, we’ll discuss BTC price prediction today, the potential reasons why it is bullish, and where can we see it in the coming weeks. Bitcoin’s short-term price prediction According to the technical analysis, Bitcoin’s prediction for today is bullish. BTC is currently trading around $104,050, having recently broken through the critical resistance level of $104,000. This surge suggests a continuation of the upward trend that began after a recent pullback to approximately $89,000 where BTC tested ema50 and bounced back up. Bitcoin 1D price chart | source: crypto.news BTC is now targeting the next major resistance at $105,000. This level has been a formidable barrier in the past and could challenge further upward momentum. Should BTC overcome this resistance, it may aim for new all-time highs in the $110,000 to $115,000 range, driven by historical patterns and psychological levels. On the downside, $100,000, which was a significant resistance prior to the breakout, now acts as a short-term support level. If BTC dips below this mark, the next support level is around $95,000, where the price consolidated before its recent rally. A more substantial decline could see Bitcoin testing crucial support at $90,000 again. The bullish sentiment is reinforced by BTC’s current position above key moving averages, which traditionally indicates a strong upward trend. Additionally, the surge in trading volume accompanying the breakout above $100,000 highlights significant buyer interest, further supporting the bullish case. Bitcoin price: latest news Since the start of 2025, BTC has been majorly influenced by fundamental news. The anticipation surrounding President-elect Donald Trump’s upcoming inauguration has notably impacted the cryptocurrency sector. His administration is expected to adopt a pro-crypto stance, with key appointments of individuals like Paul Atkins and David Sacks, who are known for their favorable views on cryptocurrency. Proposed executive orders to establish a national Bitcoin reserve and halt debunking practices signal a shift towards greater acceptance and integration of digital assets in the U.S. financial system.

This trend reflects growing confidence in Bitcoin as a legitimate financial asset, partly driven by expectations of supportive policies from the incoming administration. In summary, Bitcoin’s forecast for today is bullish and it can hit the above-mentioned targets in the short-term. It is advisable to keep an eye on the latest news about Bitcoin’s price as it can help you make an informed investment decision. FAQs Will Bitcoin go up tomorrow?

Drawing inspiration from internet memes and other trends in the market, this nascent trend sits at over $110.7 billion in market cap with a daily trade volume of $40 billion. While these memecoins present countless opportunities to make great ROI, they also help to drive global adoption for digital assets. How? Memecoins stem from memes, which is a cultural phenomenon built on the idea of relatability . They are a representation of how and what communities think, and hence see easier adoption, even from those who typically balk at the idea of getting involved in cryptocurrencies. Memecoins also reflect a growing part of today’s economic culture, where the tried and tested simply isn’t enough. Today’s traders and investors aren’t only looking at stable returns from proven strategies; they consider the possibility of exponential gain from trading memecoins. As a result of these two coming together, memecoins have practically exploded in popularity. Their wide-spread adoption has allowed them to see some form of utility beyond collection—some memecoins are even used as an avenue for enacting decentralized governance.

The two major factors that could propel such a price surge are the growing whale activity, as well as the robust network. BTC Whales Keep Buying It has been a wild few months in the cryptocurrency space. It all started with the US elections when the self-proclaimed crypto president, Donald Trump, won a decisive victory against the Democrat rival. BTC and the rest of the market shot up immediately. Despite some shockwaves and substantial turbulence on the way up, bitcoin managed to break through several barriers and ultimately shot up to over $100,000 for the first time ever in December. More volatility ensued in the following weeks, including a price dump to under $90,000 last Monday, but ultimately, the asset’s bull run endured, and it recorded a new all-time high on inauguration day of over $109,000. Although Trump failed to mention crypto during his speech, which was followed by an expected correction, BTC’s price has managed to remain within six-digit territory and is now a few grand away from charting a fresh peak. Moreover, the positive developments on US soil and perhaps the promise of a more favorable regulatory environment have pushed whales to return with massive price purchases . Data from Santiment, shared by Ali Martinez, shows that such large market participants had accumulated more than 22,000 BTC (valued at over $2.2 billion) within a span of just 72 hours. Such significant purchases dry up the available supply and reduce the immediate selling pressure, which could potentially lead to fresh price rallies. Whales have bought over 22,000 #Bitcoin $BTC in the last 72 hours, worth more than $2.24 billion! pic.twitter.com/bl87JcROKU — Ali (@ali_charts) January 21, 2025 Network Activity The second factor listed by the popular analyst is the overall network state. The aforementioned whale activity, alongside the growing number of daily active addresses, has resulted in a more robust network shape, which could also serve as a catalyst for “potential price appreciation,” asserted Martinez. #Bitcoin network activity remains strong, with daily active addresses and whale transactions increasing simultaneously. This trend signals a positive outlook for potential price appreciation. pic.twitter.com/EMf8uyv3SB — Ali (@ali_charts) January 21, 2025 The dark horse here is the upcoming actions (or lack of them) by Trump. We saw that his failure to mention crypto during his speech resulted in immediate price declines .

Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Hermetica has secured the liquidity, which it says will make it the largest stablecoin on Stacks, through collaboration with Bitcoin lending protocol Zest . The two plan to offer yield on USDh through lending against sBTC, the bitcoin-backed bridging asset that users can use to put their bitcoin wealth in the Stacks ecosystem. The initial liquidity boost could create a short-term window of higher yields, Hermetica said, with projections of an annual percentage yield (APY) as high as 50%. It currently provides an average APY of 18%, Hermetica said in an emailed announcement on Wednesday. Stablecoins play an integral role in the crypto economy, giving users a means of holding their assets in a token that isn't prone to such significant ebbs and flows in value, because they are pegged to a fiat currency (usually the U.S. dollar). Provision for stablecoins therefore would naturally be an important development in Bitcoin's evolution into a network that can support DeFi capabilities, a trend that has gathered momentum in the last couple of years . It should be pointed that, however, that the $3 million in liquidity that USDh provides is tiny compared to the dominant stablecoins in crypto. USDT and USDC have market caps of over $138 billion and $51 billion respectively , highlighting the relative infancy of the Bitcoin DeFi sector.

While the token’s debut generated billions in market capitalization and created newfound wealth for early adopters, its rapid rise and subsequent volatility have raised questions about transparency, foreign influence, and the challenges it poses to bipartisan efforts aimed at regulating the crypto industry. As policymakers and market participants weigh its significance, the meme coin is proving to be both a financial phenomenon and a political lightning rod. Trump’s Official Meme Coin Sparks Market Frenzy and Political Controversy In a press briefing that merged economic discussions with political intrigue, President Donald Trump addressed questions surrounding the explosive launch of his official Solana-based meme coin, TRUMP , which debuted just days before his inauguration. The token, initially marketed through posts on Trump’s social media platforms, has become a flashpoint for discussions about cryptocurrency, its political implications, and the broader economy. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday afternoon, President Trump played coy about the financial impact of his meme coin, saying, “I don’t know much about it other than I launched it. I heard it was very successful. I haven’t checked.” When a reporter highlighted that TRUMP had reportedly generated billions of dollars in just a few days, the president quipped, “Several billion? That’s peanuts for these guys,” gesturing toward prominent figures in the room, including SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son, OpenAI’s Sam Altman, and Oracle’s Larry Ellison. The high-profile meeting was primarily focused on a proposed joint venture between OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank, aimed at investing up to $500 billion in AI infrastructure through a new entity, Stargate. This ambitious project plans to build advanced data centers in Texas, a state known for its affordable energy, which has also made it a hub for Bitcoin mining operations. President Trump’s TRUMP meme coin debuted on Jan. 17, quickly reaching a market capitalization of $13 billion over the weekend before retracing to approximately $8 billion. However, the excitement took a dramatic turn when First Lady Melania Trump launched her own competing meme coin on Sunday. This announcement triggered a 50% crash in TRUMP’s value as market participants speculated over insider control and rivalry within the Trump brand. The rapid success of TRUMP has stirred political and financial debates. President Trump reportedly plans to issue an executive order making cryptocurrency a national policy priority, with the potential appointment of David Sacks as the administration’s crypto czar. While this could elevate the status of cryptocurrency in US policy discussions, it has also sparked concerns about partisanship derailing broader crypto legislation. TD Cowen, a prominent investment bank, warned that the meme coin’s launch could exacerbate partisan tensions, complicating efforts to pass essential market structure legislation. Critics argue that the token’s success may shift focus from meaningful reforms toward a speculative ”crypto casino” environment. Alexander Blume, CEO of Two Prim Digital Assets, voiced these concerns, saying, “The unbelievable success of it so far will also likely fortify Trump’s interest in the industry since he personally benefits. On the flip side, for those interested in cryptocurrency reshaping the global financial structure, this move brings us more towards a crypto casino than true reform.” A Market Phenomenon Despite its controversies, TRUMP has found acceptance among major exchanges, including Coinbase and Robinhood, with robust trading volumes reported. While the TRUMP token’s rise has captivated crypto enthusiasts and political observers alike, questions remain about its long-term impact on the market and regulatory landscape. Supply dynamics suggest that a significant portion of TRUMP and Melania’s meme coin are controlled by insiders, raising transparency concerns. Furthermore, Trump’s growing interest in cryptocurrency could signal a shift in the US approach to blockchain technology, especially as his administration positions itself to make digital assets a key policy area. However, as bipartisan negotiations stall amid the meme coin frenzy, the industry’s future in the US remains uncertain. President Trump’s foray into cryptocurrency has brought unprecedented attention to the sector, but not without controversy. As TRUMP continues to dominate headlines and trading platforms, its impact will likely extend beyond market caps and trading charts, influencing public perception and government policy. Whether it serves as a catalyst for innovation or merely fuels speculative excess remains to be seen. Trump’s Meme Coin Sparks Bipartisan Tensions, Threatens Crypto Legislation Progress The launch of US President Donald Trump’s controversial meme coin has also sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency and political landscapes. While the token has captured significant market attention, investment bank TD Cowen warns it could undermine efforts to pass crucial bipartisan cryptocurrency market structure legislation. TD Cowen’s Washington Research Group, led by Jaret Seiberg, issued a stark warning in a Tuesday note: the meme coin’s emergence has injected partisan discord into an already delicate legislative process. “Democrats are going to demand details on whether foreign governments and business interests used token purchases to curry favor with Team Trump,” Seiberg noted. “This puts at risk the ability to advance the crypto bill with the bipartisan support it will need to become law.” The legislation, which aims to clarify regulatory structures and reduce legal uncertainties for cryptocurrencies, is viewed as essential for expanding the crypto investor base in the United States. However, the memecoin’s launch may amplify political polarization, delaying meaningful progress. Trump’s meme coin debuted just days before his inauguration and quickly reached a market capitalization of $14 billion, generating substantial profits for early investors and creating new millionaires. However, the euphoria was short-lived as the token lost nearly half its value within days, now trading at approximately $42 with a market cap of around $8 billion. Critics argue that the meme coin’s rapid rise and fall shows the speculative excesses that many believe tarnish the crypto industry’s credibility. A crypto policy insider also recently said, “There already is an insane amount of reputational risk in crypto. This meme coin only distracts from the greater good.” The meme coin launch has drawn fierce criticism from Democrats, including Rep. Maxine Waters of California, who previously chaired the House Financial Services Committee. Waters condemned the token as emblematic of the “worst of crypto,” citing concerns over transparency and the potential for foreign influence. “Through his meme coin, Trump has created a way to circumvent national security and anti-corruption laws, allowing interested parties to anonymously transfer money to him and his inner circle,” Waters asserted. She further suggested that buyers could include corporations, allied nations seeking favor, and adversaries like Russia and China. Republicans, meanwhile, are expected to defend Trump and his financial ventures, deepening partisan divisions. TD Cowen’s Seiberg anticipates that the Trump family and administration will resist cooperating with any Democratic-led investigations, further complicating the legislative process. Market Reactions and Broader Criticism Despite its controversies, the TRUMP token has gained traction in the broader crypto market, with several exchanges listing it alongside other high-profile assets. Related indices, such as Solana-based tokens and AI-focused crypto assets, have also seen significant activity. However, the broader crypto community remains divided on the implications of TRUMP’s launch. Critics argue that it reinforces negative stereotypes about cryptocurrency as a haven for speculation and potential misconduct. To mitigate the fallout, Seiberg proposed a potential workaround: separating the meme coin investigation from broader crypto legislation. Allowing other Democratic leaders to lead inquiries could provide political cover for those willing to advance the bill while reducing partisan tensions. Seiberg expressed cautious optimism, noting that delays in crypto legislation were already expected due to mid-term election campaigns. A longer timeline could allow investigations into the meme coin to conclude before legislative voting begins in 2026. The Official Trump meme coin has become more than just a market phenomenon—it has ignited political controversy, raised ethical questions, and potentially jeopardized legislative progress in the cryptocurrency sector. While the token’s market performance continues to draw attention, its long-term impact on the US crypto industry and political landscape remains uncertain. As debates over the meme coin intensify, its role in shaping the future of cryptocurrency regulation—and its reflection on the Trump administration—will undoubtedly remain a focal point for both supporters and critics alike.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BUSINESS|FIAT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-22 14:00:00

Ethereum ( ETH ), the second-largest cryptocurrency, was trading at $3,310 on January 22, roughly 20% below its November highs. In comparison, Bitcoin ( BTC ), Solana ( SOL ), and Ripple ( XRP ) have recently retested their all-time highs. Ethereum has also continued to lose market share in key areas. For instance, Jito has overtaken Ethereum in fee revenue this year, generating $157 million compared to Ethereum’s $112 million. Ethereum’s decentralized exchange volume has also dropped significantly below that of Solana. Solana-based protocols like Raydium and Orca handled over $123 billion in volume over the past seven days, compared to Ethereum’s $26 billion. This surge was largely driven by the popularity of the Official Trump and Melania coins. The price of Ethereum has also struggled due to ongoing token sales by the Ethereum Foundation and rising exchange balances. According to CoinGlass, these balances increased to 15.8 million ETH, up from 15.3 million on January 1.

Spot Ethereum ETFs have seen consistent inflows, reflecting some demand from Wall Street investors. Over the past five days, cumulative inflows rose to $2.74 billion. Additionally, data shows Ethereum’s leverage ratio has been climbing in recent months, reaching 0.6 compared to 0.24 in September 2023. Interestingly, the leverage ratio and Ethereum’s price have diverged, which could indicate further gains ahead. ETH leverage ratio | Source: CryptoQuant Another promising factor is that Ethereum’s futures open interest has remained elevated in recent weeks. On January 22, open interest stood at over $30.3 billion, a significant increase from December’s low of $20 billion. Ethereum price technical analysis ETH price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart reveals that Ethereum price encountered strong resistance at $4,000, which represents the upper boundary of a cup and handle pattern. The cryptocurrency is currently forming the handle section of this pattern. The handle resembles a falling wedge, defined by two descending and converging trendlines. Falling wedge patterns are often bullish and indicate potential gains. Moreover, ETH has remained above the 200-day Exponential Moving Average. As a result, Ethereum is likely to experience a strong bullish breakout, with the next target potentially at $4,000, marking a 21% increase from its current level.

Early on Saturday, the token rose by more than 2,000%, sparking interest from investors. In the last 24 hours, $TRUMP rose by 86.23%, and the trading price stood at $62.59. Its trading volume increased by 273% to $47.2 billion and its market capitalization reached $12.51 billion with a growth of 85.73%. The price of the token rose to over $70 and then hovered around that price, showing that demand and trading were both high.

In a landmark ruling, clearly inspired by a recent “wind of change” in the US politics, the US District Court in Texas overturned the sanctions on Tornado Cash imposed by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). The court decided that the Treasury Department had overreached by sanctioning the crypto mixing service, which had been accused of aiding money laundering. The initial decision came at the end of November 2024 after an appeal filed by six Tornado Cash users, who argued that the sanctions violated their rights and that blockchain transactions could be traced. The court agreed with the users, stating that the immutable nature of Tornado Cash’s smart contracts made them an exception from the definition of “property” under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). This final ruling is a major victory for privacy-preserving technologies and the broader crypto community. The price of Tornado Cash’s native cryptocurrency, TORN, surged by over 140% following the news. However, the developer of Tornado Cash, Alexey Pertsev, remains in custody as the Dutch court found him guilty of money laundering charges. Initially launched in December 2019, Tornado Cash quickly became a top decentralized cryptocurrency tumbler, designed to enhance privacy by mixing potentially identifiable funds with others to obscure their origins. The service operates on Ethereum-compatible networks and uses smart contracts for its mixing process. In August 2022, the OFAC blacklisted Tornado Cash, alleging that it had facilitated the laundering of over $7 billion in virtual currencies, including funds linked to the Lazarus Group, a North Korean hacking group. As a result, the service became illegal for US citizens and businesses, leading to the removal of its GitHub repository and the suspension of its developers’ accounts. On August 10, 2022, Pertsev was arrested in Amsterdam on money laundering-related charges. The situation escalated in May 2023, when a hacker gained control of Tornado Cash’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) through a malicious proposal. The attacker gained control over the governance tokens and locked votes, ultimately stealing around $2.17 million from the protocol. Surprisingly, the hacker reached out to the Tornado Cash community shortly after and offered to return governance control. The community was divided, with most deciding to agree to the proposal to minimize damages. Fortunately, the hacker handed back control, which helped avoid further damage to the protocol.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-22 14:03:48

During a recent interview , Lubin revealed that ETF providers are actively engaged in discussions with regulators and are making strides to address complexities around staking and slashing, critical aspects of Ethereum’s proof-of-stake ecosystem. “We’ve been in discussions with the ETF providers, and they’re already working hard on that,” Lubin said. “They expect that to be greenlit reasonably soon.” Lubin also emphasized the broader benefits such funds could bring to the Ethereum ecosystem, including increased robustness, diversification, and client diversity. His comments come as fund issuers strive to craft user-friendly solutions, signaling a potentially transformative step for Ethereum’s staking ecosystem. Crypto-Friendly SEC Leadership Sparks Hope The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has not yet approved staked Ether ETFs, but the agency’s new leadership is raising industry expectations. On January 21, the SEC announced the formation of a crypto task force led by Commissioner Hester Peirce, known for her pro-crypto stance. Peirce has long been vocal about the need for regulatory clarity in the crypto space. In a December interview with Coinage, she hinted at a shift within the SEC under the new administration , suggesting that approval for staked Ether ETFs might now be within reach. “If it changes from a majority of Commissioners who don’t want things to go through to a majority of Commissioners who do want things to go through, then yeah, it’s easier,” she said. Ether ETFs Gaining Momentum Industry leaders are already showing support for this new direction. Former Polygon financial chief Young Ko highlighted the importance of Peirce’s leadership, calling it a significant win for the crypto ecosystem. “She understands the tech and is a champion for the builders,” Ko stated, noting that staked Ether ETFs could provide staking yield opportunities for investors. Approved last year, spot Ether ETFs have already made a splash in the market. Nine products were launched in July 2024, and while their initial performance lagged behind Bitcoin ETFs, they have since accumulated a total inflow of $2.7 billion. As the SEC explores the approval of staked Ether ETFs, many believe this could further bolster Ethereum’s position as a leading blockchain ecosystem.

While this has sent shockwaves through the market, experienced investors are turning their attention to a more affordable and promising alternative; RCO Finance (RCOF). Currently priced at just $0.07, RCOF is eyeing a potential surge to $3, presenting an opportunity for exponential gains. Unlike volatile memecoins, RCOF offers real-world utility and a robust ecosystem, making it a compelling choice for those seeking stability and growth. The TRUMP Token’s Meteoric Rise and Sudden Fall The TRUMP token’s debut took the crypto world by storm, largely due to its high-profile association with US President-elect Donald Trump. Launched by CIC Digital LLC, the token surged to a peak market cap of $5.5 billion within hours of its launch. For a time, it seemed like the TRUMP token was set to redefine meme coin success stories. However, the euphoria was short-lived as the token’s value plunged by nearly 50%, leaving latecomers scrambling to recover losses. The TRUMP token only emphasizes the volatile nature of meme coins. Prone to speculative hype, these tokens often experience massive initial gains followed by sharp declines. Early investors typically cash out at the peak, leaving others to face significant losses. For instance, after trading at $75, the TRUMP token now sits at $37, highlighting the risk associated with such ventures. This steep decline has sparked a growing interest in emerging assets with intrinsic value, such as RCO Finance (RCOF). Unlike meme coins, with limited use cases, RCOF offers a comprehensive ecosystem designed to deliver real-world financial solutions. RCO Finance is a More Promising Alternative RCO Finance (RCOF) stands out as a beacon of innovation in DeFi. Its ecosystem isn’t just about crypto; it’s about creating a financial hub that empowers users to take control of their wealth. One of RCOF’s standout features is its AI-powered robo-advisor, which provides tailored investment strategies based on market analysis. For instance, an investor seeking to diversify can rely on this tool to identify opportunities across 120,000 assets, including stocks, ETFs, and tokenized real estate. This feature acts as a personal financial guide, making complex investment decisions accessible to everyone. Another game-changer is RCOF’s debit card, which allows users to spend their crypto seamlessly in the real world. This card bridges the gap between digital assets and everyday spending, whether you’re trying to pay for groceries or booking travel. Add to that the platform’s KYC-free model, and users can trade without cumbersome verification processes, offering unparalleled convenience and privacy. Also, features like borrowing and lending enable users to use their assets effectively, while tokenization opens doors to fractional ownership in high-value assets like real estate. Security is paramount in RCOF’s design. The platform has undergone a rigorous audit by SolidProof, ensuring its reliability and transparency. Unlike the speculative nature of the TRUMP token, RCOF provides tangible benefits, making it a smarter choice for long-term investors. The RCOF Presale: Affordable Entry With Exponential Potential For investors looking to get in early, RCOF’s presale offers a golden opportunity. Currently priced at $0.07, the token is projected to reach $3 by 2025, representing a massive growth potential. To put this into perspective, investing just $1,000 at the current price would yield approximately 14,285 tokens. When the price rises to $0.1 in the next presale stage, the value of that investment would increase to $1,428. When RCOF hits $3, those same tokens would be worth over $42,855. This shows the rewards of investing in a value-driven asset. The platform has already raised over $10 million, signaling strong investor confidence. With features designed to address real-world financial needs, RCOF is poised to deliver gains reminiscent of the TRUMP token’s early days, but with far greater stability. Why RCOF Stands Out as the Smart Choice The volatility of the TRUMP token serves as a cautionary tale for crypto investors. While meme coins can deliver short-term gains, they often lack what’s needed for sustained growth. RCO Finance, on the other hand, combines innovation, security, and real-world utility to create a comprehensive financial ecosystem. As the presale continues, now is the time to act. At $0.07, RCOF is at its lowest price, offering a rare chance to secure a position in a project with immense potential. Don’t let the opportunity slip away as this could be the next big thing, delivering gains that rival the TRUMP token’s initial success but with far less risk.
