Recent Cardano news highlights its collaboration with FC Barcelona under the ""Barça Vision"" initiative, showcasing how blockchain technology is enhancing fan engagement through ADA rewards and NFT offerings. On the other hand, Fantom price remains under scrutiny as the platform works to regain stability following significant sell-offs by major holders, raising concerns about its future price trajectory. Amid these developments, BlockDAG (BDAG) is coming out ahead, with a bold vision that includes fostering over 200 Web3 projects and launching global hackathons in partnership with HackerEarth. By tapping into HackerEarth's network of 7.6 million developers, BlockDAG is dedicating itself to laying down the infrastructure for large-scale decentralized innovation. Having already raised over $182.5 million in its presale, with BDAG coins priced attractively at $0.0248, it's carving out a promising niche for buyers looking for significant returns. Cardano News: FC Barcelona Partnership Aims to Reshape Fan Experience In recent Cardano news, the cryptocurrency has stepped into the sports arena through a significant partnership with FC Barcelona, unveiled under the club's ""Barça Vision"" project on January 10, 2025. This collaboration seeks to revolutionize fan interaction by integrating blockchain tech to offer new job prospects, blockchain education, and a rewards system packed with ADA tokens and NFTs. This announcement gave Cardano's ADA token a nice 4% bump to $0.95, despite a tough market week that saw it slide down 11%. Cardano continues to hold strong as the world's 9th largest cryptocurrency by market cap, which currently stands at $33.5 billion, signaling a robust and expanding ecosystem. This venture highlights the transformative potential of blockchain in professional sports, showcasing ADA's critical role. The growing use cases and adoption rates offer exciting opportunities for those investing in innovative digital assets. Fantom (FTM) Price Faces Challenges Amid Whale Activity The Fantom price has seen a modest 3% recovery in the last 24 hours, but it's still down by 20% over the past week, struggling to reverse a bearish trend. The Average Directional Index (ADX), a tool for measuring trend strength, points to a weakening downtrend at 31.4, suggesting the market could be moving towards stabilization. Compounding the issue, there’s been a notable decline in activity from large holders, increasing selling pressure. The count of wallets holding between 1 million and 10 million FTM dropped from 84 to 69 in just one week, impacting the coin's liquidity. Currently, Fantom's price is wavering around $0.618 at a crucial support point. Falling below this could push prices down to test $0.50, while any recovery effort could send it climbing towards the $0.879 resistance level. Fantom continues to be a coin worth watching as it aims to regain stability and momentum. BlockDAG’s Bold Strategy: 200+ Web3 Projects & Worldwide Hackathons Looking ahead, BlockDAG is prepping for a groundbreaking year with extensive plans, including a significant alliance with HackerEarth. This partnership will facilitate four global hackathons aimed at engaging between 10,000 to 15,000 developers from HackerEarth’s comprehensive network of 7.6 million tech experts. These hackathons are crafted to spur innovation and foster a vibrant global community of developers. BlockDAG's overarching ambition is to stimulate the development of more than 200 Web3 projects within its ecosystem, giving developers the tools to innovate, test, and deploy cutting-edge decentralized applications (dApps), while showcasing what the BlockDAG Network can do. With a detailed roadmap and a visionary outlook for the future, BlockDAG is positioning itself as an increasingly appealing buying option. Market analysts estimate that BDAG, currently priced at $0.0248, could potentially soar to $1 by 2025. Its sophisticated technology, burgeoning ecosystem, and practical utility are catching the eyes of buyers eager for top-tier opportunities in today's crypto market. And the momentum is only building. BlockDAG’s presale has already netted over $182.5 million and is quickly advancing toward its $600 million target. As more developers join the ecosystem and drive its expansion, BlockDAG is affirming its role as a pivotal player in the Web3 domain. The outlook is bright for both developers and users venturing into the decentralized opportunities that BlockDAG offers. Best Altcoins For 2025 As Cardano and Fantom each navigate their unique challenges and opportunities, BlockDAG emerges as the standout blockchain platform for growth and innovation. Its ambitious initiatives, including organizing hackathons and expanding its Web3 project ecosystem, demonstrate its dedication to scalability and practical utility. Market experts forecast that BDAG could hit $1 by 2025, buoyed by its solid presale results and a strategy centered around developer engagement.

Recent Cardano updates spotlight its strategic collaboration with FC Barcelona through the ""Barça Vision"" project, demonstrating how blockchain is elevating fan interactions with ADA rewards and NFTs. Conversely, the price of Fantom is under examination as the platform strives to regain footing after major holders undertook significant sell-offs, sparking concerns about its future pricing path. In the midst of these shifts, BlockDAG (BDAG) is making notable strides with an ambitious plan to support over 200 Web3 initiatives and host global hackathons in collaboration with HackerEarth. By leveraging HackerEarth's extensive network of 7.6 million developers, BlockDAG is committed to establishing the groundwork for widespread decentralized innovation. Having successfully raised over $182.5 million in its presale, with BDAG coins attractively priced at $0.0248, it's creating a lucrative opportunity for investors seeking substantial returns.

This endeavor underscores the transformative power of blockchain in professional sports, highlighting ADA's essential role. Increasing use cases and adoption rates present thrilling prospects for those investing in digital assets at the forefront of innovation. Fantom (FTM) Price Under Pressure from Large-Scale Selling Fantom's price has shown a slight 3% recovery over the past day, but it remains down by 20% for the week, struggling against a bearish trend. The Average Directional Index (ADX), which measures trend strength, indicates a weakening downtrend at 31.4, hinting that the market might be stabilizing. Adding to the challenges, there's been a noticeable reduction in activity from large holders, exerting further selling pressure. The number of wallets holding between 1 million and 10 million FTM decreased from 84 to 69 in just a week, affecting the coin's liquidity. Currently, Fantom's price hovers around $0.618, a critical support level. Dropping below this could drive prices down to test $0.50, whereas a recovery effort might propel it towards the $0.879 resistance. Fantom remains a cryptocurrency to monitor as it seeks to regain stability and upward momentum. BlockDAG's Ambitious Agenda: Launching 200+ Web3 Projects with Global Hackathons Looking forward, BlockDAG is gearing up for a transformative year, marked by a major partnership with HackerEarth.

Elon Musk Salute (MUSKSAL), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKSAL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Elon Musk Salute can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Musk Salute could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Musk Salute launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Musk Salute on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Musk Salute by entering its contract address – GmFHmHWARyCD1FHVHiCc3kXZPwCDvzR5gFu2sFeeGphP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKSAL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-21 23:29:15

Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Jan. 21st, Brian reportedly told Yahoo Finance that Trump’s enthusiasm for Bitcoin proves his ambition to make America the “crypto capital of the planet.” “He really wants to be the first Bitcoin president,” Brian said, adding that his meetings with Trump before and after the election focused on the crypto industry’s potential. The Coinbase CEO explained that just as the U.S. holds reserves in gold, oil, and rare minerals like palladium, Bitcoin is the next logical step. “The world is moving to a Bitcoin standard for money. Any government that holds gold should also hold Bitcoin as a reserve. President Trump gets that.” The First Family’s crypto venture Last Friday, the president launched his meme coin Official Trump (TRUMP), marketed with the slogan, “Join the Trump Community. This is History in the Making!” The coin, developed by CIC Digital, an affiliate of the Trump Organization, has a carefully managed supply structure. The official website shows that CIC Digital and its affiliates own 80% of the total supply, with new tokens scheduled for release over three years. Affiliates will reportedly earn revenue from trading fees as tokens are sold. Within 48 hours of its launch, the TRUMP meme coin reached a $73 billion market cap, briefly surpassing Dogecoin as the largest meme coin. However, its valuation has since dropped to $7.3 billion, according to current data from CoinMarketCap. The very next day, First Lady Melania Trump launched her own meme coin, Melania Meme (MELANIA), which currently holds a $732 million market cap. As Cryptopolitan reported, government ethics watchdogs have raised concerns about the Trump family profiting from their political positions. Despite the backlash though, industry analysts see this as a turning point. Asset manager Bernstein, said, “The launch of a meme coin by the biggest political figure in the world is a massive paradigm shift in how governments view crypto. This could be the beginning of direct engagement with the masses through blockchain technology.” Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis, a proud and renowned Bitcoin supporter in Congress, introduced the Bitcoin Act of 2024 in July to establish a reserve holding 200,000 Bitcoins, worth $2.1 billion at current prices. After Trump’s November 5 win, she tweeted, “We are going to build a strategic Bitcoin reserve.” Yesterday, Lummis met with Eric Trump at the Capitol to discuss plans for the reserve, according to Bloomberg. Eric then took to social media, urging investors to “bet on crypto” as part of their belief in America’s limitless potential. “No question Biden left a mess, but that mess will be corrected, and the next four years are going to be spectacular,” he said, predicting “transformational wealth” under his Dad’s leadership.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. While PEPE and Solana’s Fartcoin target gains, PropiChain is set to steal the spotlight with its potential rise from $0.01 to $3. Table of Contents PEPE and Solana’s Fartcoin PropiChain Why PropiChain could rise from $0.01 to $3 PropiChain’s unique features The PropiChain presale The crypto market is dynamic as ever, with meme coins like PEPE and Solana’s Fartcoin capturing the spotlight with their price surges. Often rooted in humor and online culture, these projects have gained traction among retail investors seeking quick profits. While PEPE aims to use its established meme status, Fartcoin capitalizes on Solana’s high-performance blockchain to drive interest. Both PEPE and Fartcoin have set ambitious targets, drawing attention to their potential. However, their speculative nature raises questions about long-term sustainability. Amid the hype surrounding these meme coins, PropiChain (PCHAIN) is emerging as a serious contender for the top gainer position in the crypto space in Q2 2025. Market experts say PCHAIN is poised to rally from $0.01 to $3. Focused on transforming the real estate industry, estimated to be worth $600 trillion, through blockchain technology, PropiChain offers a utility-driven narrative. PEPE and Solana’s Fartcoin PEPE has become a standout player in the memecoin ecosystem. While the memecoin has evolved into a symbol of community-driven crypto success, the volatile nature of meme-based assets still poses a big concern for investors. The Solana ecosystem has birthed many projects, but few are as notable as Fartcoin . Combining humor with innovation, Solana’s Fartcoin has captured attention with its playful branding and unique tokenomics. Fartcoin’s rise is attributed to its viral marketing campaigns and a strong push from influencers. PropiChain While PEPE and Fartcoin thrive on humor and virality, PCHAIN is carving a niche in the rapidly growing tokenized real estate market. Launched to democratize property ownership, PCHAIN enables users to invest in fractional shares of real estate assets through blockchain technology. The emphasis on tangible utility and real-world application sets PCHAIN apart from meme-based assets. The platform is thus poised to capture a percentage of the $600 trillion real estate market. By deploying blockchain’s transparency and efficiency, PCHAIN aims to lower barriers to entry for real estate investment while providing liquidity to a traditionally illiquid market. Why PropiChain could rise from $0.01 to $3 PCHAIN is positioned for a massive rally that could see early presale investors enjoy over 29,000% ROI. Growing demand for tokenized assets The tokenization of real-world assets is gaining significant traction, with the market projected to hit $16 trillion. PropiChain is well-positioned to capitalize on this shift, offering an easy-to-use platform for both retail and institutional investors. Strategic partnerships PropiChain’s collaborations with established players in the real estate industry add credibility to its model. These partnerships are expected to drive adoption and increase the value of its native token, PCHAIN. Market sentiment As the broader crypto market looks for projects with real-world utility, PCHAIN’s value proposition stands out. You might also like: Promising crypto presale to invest in with potential SHIB style rally in 2025 PropiChain’s unique features PropiChain aims to reshape the real estate industry by using advanced technology to redefine property transactions. The platform will set new standards for buying, selling, and investing in real estate globally with four transformative features: Immersive virtual property exploration The platform will transform how investors and buyers scout properties using cutting-edge Metaverse technology. It will facilitate remote property exploration through immersive 3D virtual tours, overcoming geographical limitations and making real estate investment accessible to a wider audience. By enabling real-time property assessments without physical visits, investors can save time and money. Smart contracts for automated and secure transactions The platform will utilize blockchain-based smart contracts to automate critical real estate processes. These self-executing digital agreements can handle tasks such as ownership transfers, lease management & agreement, and rental payments, significantly reducing the need for intermediaries like brokers and agents. AI-driven investment insights The platform will incorporate artificial intelligence to optimize real estate investment strategies. Its AI-powered virtual assistants and chatbots will provide round-the-clock support, helping investors navigate the real estate market seamlessly. Additionally, its predictive AI system will analyze market trends, predict property value changes, and deliver data-driven recommendations. These insights empower investors to make informed decisions, boosting profitability while minimizing risks. Real estate tokenization for broader investment opportunities PCHAIN will enable the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA), turning physical properties into digital tokens. This approach will allow for fractional ownership of high-value real estate, increasing market liquidity and democratizing access to property investments. The PropiChain presale PropiChain’s focus on real-world utility combined and its potential rally from $0.011 to $3 positions it for the top-gamer position in 2025. The project raised over $1.3 million in the first presale round and has already crossed the $970,000 mark in the ongoing second presale round. This underscores the high confidence of investors in the project’s potential. After this presale round, the token price will rise by over 109% for the third and final presale round. The token is listed on CoinMarketCap , a statement of the project’s readiness to do bigger things in the crypto space. Additionally, BlockAudit , a top blockchain security company, audited the project’s smart contract and certified that it has no vulnerability.

His decision is said to stem from a desire to run for governor of Ohio next year, with the current occupant of the seat, Mike DeWine, ineligible for reelection in 2026 since he is serving his second four-year term in office. A Political Pivot for Ramaswamy It is not the first time Ramaswamy has shown interest in high-profile political roles, having sought the Republican nomination for president in 2024. He had also shown interest in succeeding Vice President JD Vance as the senator for Ohio before Governor DeWine selected his deputy, Jon Husted, to fill the vacancy. His departure from D.O.G.E, first reported by The Associated Press, is in line with the department’s new structural guidelines, which require members to step back from active roles if pursuing elected office. The Cincinnati native has been a vocal advocate for crypto, criticizing the regulatory approach to the assets in the U.S. and even accusing the Biden administration and Wall Street of trying to “suppress” the industry. He praised Grayscale’s victory against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) when it wanted to convert its Bitcoin Trust into a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF), saying the win made it possible to keep BTC and blockchain innovations in the U.S. instead of pushing them overseas. Towards the end of last year, his company, Strive Asset Management, filed for a BTC bond ETF with the SEC that would provide institutional investors and everyday Americans easy access to financial instruments based on the number one cryptocurrency. Musk Left as Sole Leader President Donald Trump appointed the 38-year-old to lead DOGE alongside Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk soon after winning the elections in late 2024. Launched under his “Save America” agenda, Trump formally established the task force via an executive order on the day of his inauguration. It aims to modernize the federal government’s operations by slashing inefficiencies, reducing regulatory red tape, and streamlining government spending. Alongside its bold goals, the initiative drew attention due to its playful acronym, which is similar to the ticker of the largest meme coin by market capitalization, Dogecoin. Incidentally, Musk, who is now its sole leader, is a long-term supporter of Dogecoin, even earning the nickname “Dogefather” for his endorsement of the token. The billionaire businessman recently proposed a public “leaderboard” that would highlight the most egregious examples of government inefficiency, an idea he described as “tragic” and “entertaining.” The post Vivek Ramaswamy Resigns as D.O.G.E Co-Lead to Run for Ohio Governor: Report appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Elon Musk|United States|Vivek Ramaswamy,EN,0,0,DOGE|REGULATION|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-01-21 23:51:43

Among the projects driving this revolution, WallitIQ (WLTQ) , Near Protocol (NEAR), and Internet Computer (ICP) have emerged as the top trending coins poised for a legendary climb. The renowned analyst forecasts astronomical gains for these artificial intelligence (AI) coins, with the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token set to skyrocket to $55. Near Protocol (NEAR) and Internet Computer (ICP) are also expected to record significant price surges. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Token Set To Surge To $55 The renowned analyst predicts that the WallitIQ (WLTQ) AI token will surge from its presale price of $0.0420 to an incredible $55 before the year runs out. This is an unprecedented opportunity for investors to lock in massive returns. The analyst is confident of this exponential price surge because of the platform’s impressive utilities.

According to recent Cardano news, its partnership with FC Barcelona through the “Barça Vision” initiative emphasizes blockchain’s critical role in enhancing fan experiences with ADA rewards and NFTs. Meanwhile, Fantom is striving to stabilize its market position, as significant sell-offs by major holders have brought Fantom price volatility into focus. BlockDAG (BDAG) , however, stands out with its ambitious roadmap aimed at nurturing over 200 Web3 projects and organizing global hackathons in collaboration with HackerEarth. Utilizing a vast network of 7.6 million developers, BlockDAG is diligently laying the groundwork for scalable decentralized innovation. With a presale that has amassed over $182 million and BDAG coins currently priced at $0.0248, it represents a prime opportunity for buyers seeking significant returns. Cardano News: FC Barcelona Partnership Aims to Enhance Fan Engagement Recent Cardano news has seen it penetrate the sports sector through a partnership with FC Barcelona, unveiled on January 10, 2025, under the club’s “Barça Vision” initiative. This partnership is set to revolutionize fan engagement by leveraging blockchain technology to offer new employment opportunities, educational initiatives in blockchain, and a rewards system featuring ADA tokens and NFTs. This announcement propelled Cardano’s ADA token up by 4%, reaching $0.95, despite facing a 11% decline earlier in the week due to broader market conditions. Cardano continues to hold its position as the 9th largest cryptocurrency globally, with a market cap of $33.5 billion, indicating a growing ecosystem. This collaboration underscores the transformative potential of blockchain in professional sports, with ADA playing an integral role. Its practical applications and increasing adoption offer substantial growth opportunities for stakeholders in cutting-edge digital assets. Fantom (FTM) Price Encounters Challenges Amid Whale Sell-Off Fantom’s price has experienced a slight 3% recovery in the last 24 hours, though it remains down 20% over the past week as it attempts to counter a prevailing bearish trend. The Average Directional Index (ADX), which quantifies trend strength, has decreased to 31.4, indicating a weakening of the downtrend and a potential shift towards market stabilization. Further, a significant reduction in large holder activity has heightened selling pressure, with the number of wallets holding between 1 million and 10 million FTM decreasing from 84 to 69 over the week, impacting market liquidity. Fantom’s price is now teetering around $0.618 at a pivotal support level. Should it fall below, the price might test the lower support at $0.50; conversely, a rebound could elevate FTM towards the $0.879 resistance mark. Fantom remains a digital asset worth monitoring as it strives for stability and momentum. BlockDAG’s Ambitious Vision: Over 200 Web3 Projects & Worldwide Hackathons BlockDAG is gearing up for an impactful year with grand plans, including a significant partnership with HackerEarth. This alliance will see BlockDAG host four international hackathons, aiming to involve 10,000 to 15,000 developers from HackerEarth’s extensive network of 7.6 million tech experts. These hackathons are designed to foster innovation and develop a diverse global community of developers. BlockDAG’s overarching goal is to catalyze the creation of over 200 Web3 projects within its network, giving developers opportunities to innovate, test, and deploy state-of-the-art decentralized applications (dApps) while demonstrating BlockDAG Network’s distinctive capabilities. With a definitive roadmap and a strong vision for the future, BlockDAG is proving to be an increasingly appealing choice. Analysts estimate that BDAG, with a current price of $0.0248, could potentially escalate to $1 by 2025. Its sophisticated technology, expanding ecosystem, and practical utility are attracting buyers searching for premier opportunities in today’s crypto market. The enthusiasm continues as BlockDAG’s presale has already raised over $182 million and is swiftly progressing towards its $600 million target. As more developers engage and enrich the ecosystem, BlockDAG is solidifying its role as a fundamental player in the Web3 realm. The prospects for both developers and users delving into decentralized options with BlockDAG are looking increasingly promising. Best Altcoins for 2025 While Cardano and Fantom each navigate their distinct challenges and prospects, BlockDAG ascends as the definitive platform for growth and innovation in blockchain. Its lofty ambitions, such as hosting hackathons and expanding its Web3 project ecosystem, underscore its commitment to scalability and utility. Analysts predict that BDAG could reach $1 by 2025, supported by robust presale results and a developer-centric strategy. For those aiming to capitalize on the forthcoming major waves in the crypto world, BlockDAG presents the most compelling proposition, offering both short-term potential and a long-term vision that cements its leadership in the Web3 revolution.

However, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is drawing more attention with its under $0.5 token poised to jump to $5 upon its launch. WallitIQ (WLTQ): A Game Changer In The World Of DeFi While the recent Shiba Inu price prediction has made headlines, the ongoing WallitIQ (WLTQ) is experiencing a high influx of investors looking to make significant gains given the token’s potential to rise from its under $0.05 presale price to $5 in the shortest period the crypto market has ever seen. The primary objective of WallitIQ (WLTQ) is to promote financial literacy, security, and decentralization among crypto enthusiasts through AI solutions and machine learning algorithms. According to most crypto experts, the increase in demand for efficient and secure wallet solutions positions WallitIQ (WLTQ) for rapid success in the booming billion-dollar crypto wallet and AI market. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) projected $10 million in monthly revenue has attracted both retail and institutional investors looking to secure their spots in the ongoing presale. While investors who joined the presale from the first stage have already secured gains of over 150%, those who chose to join now will also receive several benefits, such as governance participation, premium features, and quick returns due to token price appreciation in the following stage of the presale. In addition to its potential rise from under $0.05 to $5, WallitIQ (WLTQ) provides round-the-clock blockchain activities for its users, which include yield farming, trading of over 2,000 cryptocurrencies, and staking mechanisms that yield significant returns of up to 180% for token holders. Interestingly, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has announced the MVP build of its Crypto Wallet Management Mobile App that offers a wide range of services, including crypto payments for daily purchases like Starbucks coffee or Spotify subscriptions, CoinGecko API integration for real-time crypto price tracking, simulated management of crypto wallets for ETH and USDT, and more. As a platform that prioritizes security in DeFi, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has undergone a thorough smart contract audit conducted by SolidProof , a cybersecurity and blockchain audit firm known for protecting blockchain projects and financial institutions from any cyber attack. To further bolster user confidence, WallitIQ (WLTQ) employs the advanced encryption standard (AES) and elliptic cryptographic curve (ECC) to protect its users’ transactions and private keys from unauthorized devices or individuals. The Potential Shiba Inu Price Surge To $5 The significant increase in the Shiba Inu burn rate signifies the growing interest in its community to reduce its supply, leading analysts to project that it will trigger the Shiba Inu price surge to $0.05. According to a post from X (formerly Twitter) by Shibburn, a total of 44,623,604,014 SHIB were burned in 2024, which further contributed to a yearly increase of 149% in the Shiba Inu price. Trading alongside the broader crypto market, the Shiba Inu price has also gained momentum as Bitcoin retests the $100,000 price mark. The Shiba Inu price has been up 3.8% on the weekly charts, aiming to climb higher amidst the imminent meme frenzy. Data obtained from CoinGecko shows that SHIB has a market of $13.4 billion with a daily trading volume of $730 million. As of the time of this writing, the Shiba Inu price is trading at $0.00002284. Join The WallitIQ (WLTQ) Presale WallitIQ (WLTQ) is currently in the third stage of its presale, with millions of tokens sold and over $6 million raised in just a few months. In anticipation of its official launch, smart investors are rapidly buying the WallitIQ native token (WLTQ) for a low price of $0.0420 each in order to secure substantial gains from its projected rise to $5. Following the growing presale momentum, most crypto experts strongly believe the WallitIQ (WLTQ) would come to an end sooner than expected. As an investor seeking profitable investment opportunities, WallitIQ’s low entry price level presents just the perfect offer that will allow both retail and investors to grow their wealth.

Initially launched in October with a goal of selling only 20 billion WLF tokens, the decentralized finance’s (DeFi) venture token surpassed this target by selling 21 billion tokens, demonstrating robust demand despite a rocky start. Eric Trump Champions World Liberty Financial At ‘High-Profile Event’ Per the report, this surge in interest comes as WLF announces the release of an additional 5 billion tokens from its total supply of 100 billion, citing “massive demand and overwhelming interest.” The Trump family’s foray into the cryptocurrency space has been marked by a blend of enthusiasm and controversy. Over the weekend, both Donald Trump and his wife, Melania, launched their own memecoins, which experienced rapid spikes in value. Related Reading: $24 XRP Prediction: Bitcoin Maxi Calls It Risky But Possible Eric Trump, actively promoting World Liberty Financial, also attended a “high-profile crypto event” in Washington, celebrating the intersection of politics and digital assets as his father prepares for a new administration. Trump’s embrace of the crypto sector during his election campaign has resonated with industry executives, many of whom anticipate a more favorable regulatory environment compared to the policies of the outgoing Biden administration. The appointment of crypto-friendly figures, such as Paul Atkins to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and David Sacks as the newly created artificial intelligence (AI) and Crypto Czar, further underscores this potential shift. However, the venture has not been without its critics. Trump’s Memecoins Spark Controversy Concerns arise over the limited rights associated with WLF tokens, which provide holders with only minimal voting rights and no economic entitlements. Furthermore, the tokens cannot be traded or sold back to WLF, leading to questions about their long-term value and utility. Compounding the intrigue surrounding WLF, notable crypto entrepreneur and TRON blockchain founder Justin Sun recently revealed a significant investment of $45 million into the venture, raising his total stake to $75 million. The market’s reaction has been volatile, exemplified by Bitcoin’s brief spike to a record high of over $109,000 on Monday, followed by a retraction toward $102,000 after Trump’s inauguration speech. Analysts now speculate that upcoming executive orders from Trump could bolster the crypto industry’s fortunes in the US, although skepticism lingers among some industry veterans. Nic Carter, a venture capitalist, articulated concerns about the “ethical implications” of a sitting president engaging in business ventures that could be perceived as “conflicts of interest.” Related Reading: This Analyst Correctly Predicted The Bitcoin Price Crash To $99,000, Here’s What’s Supposed To Happen Next The launch of Trump’s memecoins has also stirred controversy, with the Donald Trump memecoin experiencing a sharp decline from a weekend high of $75 to $52. Meanwhile, the Melania Trump memecoin, which disrupted the market dynamics of the Donald coin, saw its value fluctuate significantly from a high of $13.64 to $8.43. Bernstein analysts have noted that this “chaotic crypto era” marks a critical juncture, suggesting that government engagement with cryptocurrencies may redefine the relationship between leadership and emerging technologies. The analysts assert that the launch of Trump and Melania’s memecoins signifies a potential regulatory shift in the country, where digital assets could serve as a direct connection to a mass audience.

From Just a Chill Guy (CHILLGUY) to Brett (Based), meme coins are proving their staying power in the market, with the potential for massive returns. However, amidst the frenzy of tokens flying off the shelf, one meme coin stands apart: Arctic Pablo ($APC). As it embarks on an epic, mythical journey, Arctic Pablo offers an adventure-filled investment opportunity that promises a long-term ROI that may leave competitors in the dust. But how does Arctic Pablo compare to other top contenders like Just a Chill Guy and Brett? In this article, we’ll take you on an exciting journey to explore these coins, their presale opportunities, and why Arctic Pablo is the best meme coin to buy today for those seeking explosive returns. Let’s investigate the details and discover why Arctic Pablo could be your ticket to massive profit. Arctic Pablo: The Adventurous Meme Coin with Mythical Potential Arctic Pablo is not your average meme coin. Far from the ordinary hype-driven tokens you may be used to, Arctic Pablo ($APC) presents an exciting opportunity at the intersection of myth, reality, and exploration. As Arctic Pablo embarks on his journey through uncharted, mystical lands, he discovers hidden treasures—$APC tokens—that transcend traditional cryptocurrency investments. Currently priced at $0.000026, Arctic Pablo’s presale has already raised over $200,000 in just 12 days, proving that investors are excited about this unique concept. Each presale phase represents a new location, with Pablo traveling from the frosty peaks of the Metropolis to his next destination, Snowy Shores. While other meme coins are content with generic presales, Arctic Pablo creates a sense of adventure and urgency, inviting investors to get in early and stake their claim. What’s the catch? Well, Arctic Pablo’s presale isn’t structured in the usual “stages.” Instead, it’s divided into locations, each representing a new realm of hidden treasures. Metropolis’s current location is already showing off an incredible 30,692% ROI from the 4th stage to the projected listing price of $0.008. As Arctic Pablo’s journey unfolds, early investors are positioned to see explosive returns—so the question is, are you ready to take the ride? If you were to invest $800 in Arctic Pablo at the current presale price of $0.000026, you’d receive a massive $30,718,984.00 APC. When the token hits its launch price of $0.008, your initial investment would balloon to $245,751.872. With numbers like that, it’s easy to see why Arctic Pablo is quickly climbing the ranks of the best meme coins to invest in for short-term gains. Just a Chill Guy: The Cool Cat of Meme Coins Next on our list is Just a Chill Guy (CHILLGUY), a meme coin that brings a laid-back vibe to the crypto scene. Currently priced at $0.07067, CHILLGUY has seen some fluctuations in price, with a recent drop of 16.67%. Despite these ups and downs, CHILLGUY remains a favorite within the Solana and Pump Fun ecosystems, boasting a market cap of around $70.67 million. What makes CHILLGUY stand out? Well, its roots in meme culture and a strong community keep it relevant, even in volatile markets. However, while Just a Chill Guy has made its mark, it doesn’t have the same kind of explosive ROI potential that Arctic Pablo currently offers. At its all-time high of $0.6651, it has since experienced an 89.39% decline, showing that while CHILLGUY may have potential, it doesn’t carry the same level of excitement as Arctic Pablo’s innovative approach. While Just a Chill Guy has a solid fanbase and a market cap that reflects its popularity, Arctic Pablo’s presale model and ongoing journey through unique locations put it on track to outpace meme coins like CHILLGUY in the long run. The potential for ROI with Arctic Pablo far outweighs what CHILLGUY offers, making it one of the best meme coins to buy today. Brett: The Meme Coin on the Rise Let’s now take a look at Brett (Based), another popular meme coin that’s been gaining traction. Priced at $0.09027, Brett has seen a 10.37% decline in the last 24 hours. Despite this, it’s still managed to maintain a market cap of around $889.71 million. With a max supply nearing 10 billion coins and a circulating supply of just under 10 billion, Brett is one of the larger meme coins in terms of market cap. While Brett has certainly shown its potential with a significant rise of 83,764.37% from its all-time low, it has not been able to maintain the same consistent upward momentum that Arctic Pablo boasts. The coin’s recent 61.59% drop from its all-time high of $0.235 reflects some of the volatility that can affect larger meme coins. Still, despite its large supply and strong market cap, Brett (Based) doesn’t provide the kind of innovative opportunity that Arctic Pablo does with its unique presale model and high ROI potential. If you’re looking for the best meme coin to buy today, Brett may seem like a solid investment, but Arctic Pablo’s out-of-the-box approach to presale locations and its jaw-dropping ROI numbers should make it the clear frontrunner. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo stands out as the best meme coin to buy today. Its unique presale model, innovative narrative, and astronomical ROI potential make it a top contender for short-term investments. With over $200,000 already raised, Arctic Pablo’s journey through mystical locations offers investors a thrilling ride that other meme coins like Just a Chill Guy and Brett simply can’t match. The opportunity to buy in early at $0.000026 and watch your investment grow as Arctic Pablo nears its launch price of $0.008 is too good to ignore. With a 66% APY staking program, investors can see their investments grow even further while being part of an exciting adventure that bridges myth and reality. If you want to be part of this exciting journey and maximize your ROI, join the Arctic Pablo presale now and stake your claim in one of the best meme coins to invest in for short-term gains.

39276474,https://timestabloid.com/?p=55189,1737504218,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Top Crypto Proponent Calls $100 XRP Price. Here’s the Timeline,https://timestabloid.com/top-crypto-proponent-calls-100-per-xrp-heres-the-timeline/,"A recent tweet by JackTheRippler, a well-known cryptocurrency commentator, has sparked widespread discussion within the XRP community. The tweet, reading simply, ”$100 per #XRP this year. YES or NO?”, has garnered responses from various enthusiasts on X (formerly Twitter), who shared their perspectives on whether this milestone is achievable for XRP in 2025. The conversation underscores the heightened anticipation surrounding XRP and its potential adoption in cross-border payments and broader financial systems. Two notable replies highlight different perspectives on the feasibility of XRP reaching such a valuation this year. Community Perspectives One respondent, Seek 1st, tied the possibility of a $100 XRP price to the growth of activity on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). They stated, “It all depends on how much traffic there will be on XRPL by year’s end. We know how many potential vehicles will eventually be running but how fast is the adoption?” This comment reflects a common view that XRP’s price growth is contingent upon real-world utility, particularly through increased usage of the XRPL for transactions. Seek 1st further suggested that macroeconomic factors and potential policy changes could play a significant role, mentioning former U.S. President Donald Trump’s potential influence: “We may know a lot more by the end of this month after Trump gives an update.” This highlights how cryptocurrency enthusiasts closely watch broader financial and political developments as potential catalysts for market changes. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Another user, Nicolas Soria, took a more optimistic stance, pointing to the potential for XRP to become the standard for cross-border transactions. Soria wrote , “If implementation of XRP becomes the norm of all cross-border transactions at every major financial institution, then I think it might go higher than that this year.” This comment underscores the transformative potential of XRP’s adoption in the global financial ecosystem, provided institutions continue integrating the asset into their operations. Soria also hinted at rumors of forthcoming executive orders that may benefit the crypto market, writing, “Rumor has it that there are going to be executive orders signed that are very pro-crypto to begin economic recovery.” While these claims remain unverified, they reflect the optimism within the XRP community about regulatory developments favoring the broader adoption of digital assets. The debate sparked by JackTheRippler’s tweet highlights the blend of cautious optimism and bold speculation that defines the XRP community. While many agree that the potential for significant price growth exists, much hinges on real-world adoption, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic factors. As 2025 progresses, these variables will continue to shape XRP’s performance, keeping the community closely engaged in the asset’s journey.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Analyzing 5 cryptos for 2025, led by new contender Rexas Finance. Table of Contents Rexas Finance Nodle Bifrost Shiden Network KILT Protocol Conclusion 2025 is giving bullish sentiment with Donald Trump as the new U.S. president. Investors are looking to position themselves in order to capitalize on this bullish trend, and top analysts have identified some of the coins with the potential to drive riches. Rexas Finance, Nodle, Bifrost, Shiden Network, and KILT Protocol have stood out. Of the five, Rexas Finance is making waves with its transformative approach to real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and its selling out presale. Rexas Finance Rexas Finance has caught the eye of both investors and analysts due to its focus on RWA tokenization. This is a new way of tokenizing physical and digital assets, offering fractional ownership and greater liquidity. RXS is in Stage 11 of its presale, which is currently priced at $0.175, having already raised $36,381,133 out of its $41 million funding target. The presale has been on a lot of people’s radar, with 399 million tokens already bought out of a total of 425 million. Rexas Finance is listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, further boosting confidence. The project also has a Certik audit , showing that it takes its security and transparency seriously. As the presale continues, RXS could soar to incredible price heights in 2025. Nodle Another cryptocurrency that is picking up speed is Nodle, which is worth about $0.00247. Nodle has gotten investors looking for potential growth, witnessing a price increase of almost 8% in the past 24 hours. Analysts believe that Nodle could offer an ROI of about 320%. Therefore, as a decentralized wireless network, it is well-placed to take advantage of the steadily increasing demand. Bifrost Built on Bifrost’s proprietary technology, which aims to bridge different blockchain ecosystems, the token is currently trading at $0.2162, with minor growth of 1.62% over the past week.

Ulbricht created the online black marketplace in 2011, which facilitated the anonymous sale of illegal drugs and illicit goods using Bitcoin as a method of payment. After his arrest in 2013, Ulbricht received a double life sentence plus 40 years without the possibility of parole, which was significantly harsher than many individuals who sold illicit goods on Silk Road or similar platforms. Now, with Ulbricht at age 40, President Trump has issued an unconditional pardon and a statement on Truth Social. “I just called the mother of Ross William Ulbricht to let her know that in honor of her and the Libertarian Movement, which supported me so strongly, it was my pleasure to have just signed a full and unconditional pardon of her son, Ross. The scum that worked to convict him were some of the same lunatics who were involved in the modern day weaponization of government against me. He was given two life sentences, plus 40 years. Ridiculous!” Ulbricht’s mantra for Silk Road centered on principles of personal freedom and individual sovereignty. He touted a marketplace free from government oversight, where people could trade freely as long as no harm was directly caused to others. That philosophy was reflected in Silk Road’s inconsistently enforced and often ignored terms and conditions, which prohibited listings for items explicitly intended to harm others, such as stolen goods, child exploitation material or weapons intended for violence.

Is it the strength of its community, the exciting developments behind it, or the growth potential? If we look at DOGS (DOGS) and PUDGY Penguins (PENGU), it’s clear that these coins are facing some challenges. DOGS has dropped by 22.5% in the past week, while PENGU has seen a 28.8% decline. This has left many investors looking for the next big opportunity. Enter BTFD Coin, which has emerged as a major contender in the meme coin world. The BTFD Coin presale has already made waves, currently in Stage 14, and it’s rapidly catching the attention of savvy investors. With over $5.4 million raised, 65 billion coins sold, and over 8,900 bulls backing it, BTFD Coin is on the rise. This article will explore why BTFD Coin is one of the top new meme coin presales to invest in today , and why now is the perfect time to jump on board. BTFD Coin: The Presale Sensation Ready to Rocket Why is BTFD Coin getting so much attention? It’s not just another meme coin; BTFD Coin is proving to be a powerhouse in the presale market. With its current price of $0.0001600, BTFD Coin offers an incredible entry point for investors. The coin’s presale has already seen massive success, with more than 65 billion coins sold and $5.4 million raised. And as the presale enters Stage 14, investors are looking at significant upside potential. At the moment, BTFD Coin is in a unique position. The project is not only backed by a strong and growing community but also offers staking rewards that can yield up to 90% APY, along with a P2E game that was launched in full on January 1, 2025. The future of BTFD Coin looks bright, and analysts are predicting significant price growth after the coin is listed, which adds further to the excitement. As Stage 14 is here, the demand for BTFD Coin is only expected to rise, especially with the announcement of unsold tokens being burned from Stage 13. To make this opportunity even more appealing, the BTFD Coin presale is offering a 100% bonus with the code LAUNCH100 . This means that for every $BTFD purchased in stage 14, buyers will receive double the tokens—an offer too good to pass up for anyone looking to own the dip.

Dogs: A Vibrant Community But Struggling to Gain Momentum Dogs (DOGS) has a strong community and an interesting project built on the TON Blockchain, but the coin is facing some hurdles. Currently trading at $0.000332, DOGS has experienced a 22.5% drop over the past week, leaving some investors wondering where the price is headed. The project’s reliance on Telegram’s vast user base and its focus on tokenized stickers provides some unique features, but the coin’s recent price movement suggests that it’s struggling to maintain upward momentum. Despite these challenges, the DOGS community remains dedicated, and there’s potential for future growth. Analysts are predicting that DOGS could reach $0.00040 by 2025, which is a positive sign for the future. Pudgy Penguins: Can It Recover from Recent Losses? Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) has established itself as a cultural icon in the meme coin space, with a massive following and millions of views across various platforms. Despite this, the coin is facing a 28.8% decline over the past week, and its trading volume has decreased by 47.6%. Currently priced at $0.02368, PENGU has seen a dramatic fall from its ATH of $0.05738 in December 2024. While Pudgy Penguins remains a well-known project with a strong community, it’s clear that the coin is facing challenges in the current market. As with DOGS, the coin’s performance will depend on its ability to recover and regain investor confidence.

It recently suffered a steep decline, losing over 50% in the past month. However, the RSI indicates it’s not overly oversold. Immediate resistance sits at $0.17, with a major obstacle at $0.23. Breaking these barriers could lead to gains of 30% to 70%. The coin is close to its 10-day moving average, suggesting potential for upward movement if momentum gathers. Yet, with an 81.84% drop over the past six months, caution is advised. The road ahead may be challenging, but if bullish sentiment returns, CHILLGUY could make a surprising comeback. Super Trump (STRUMP): On the Verge of a Potential Surge? Super Trump (STRUMP) might be gearing up for a significant move. Its current price ranges from about $0.00179 to $0.00427, well below recent highs, indicating possible room for growth. The 10-day simple moving average is under the 100-day average, suggesting potential upward momentum. At an RSI of 33.81, the coin appears oversold, hinting at a possible rebound. If it can break the $0.00562 resistance level, it could aim for $0.00809. Despite a decline over the past week and month, this correction phase might set the stage for a powerful upswing. Stay alert for any signs of a bullish trend. Conclusion While ENA, SHIRO, CHILLGUY, and STRUMP may show limited short-term potential, Catzilla stands out as the ultimate meme coin hero aimed at providing financial freedom for all. Offering a 700% ROI in its presale across 14 stages, it combines governance, rewards, and staking.

Trump, 78, announced the decision on Truth Social, sharing that he personally informed Ulbricht’s mother of the news. The president wrote: “I just called the mother of Ross William Ulbricht to let her know that in honor of her and the Libertarian Movement, which supported me so strongly, it was my pleasure to have just signed a full and unconditional pardon of her son, Ross.” Ulbricht had been serving two life sentences plus 40 years without parole at a maximum-security prison in Arizona since 2015. His charges stemmed from running Silk Road, a notorious darknet marketplace that facilitated illegal transactions, mostly paid for in Bitcoin a long time ago. Trump called Ulbricht’s punishment “ridiculous” and blamed “leftist lunatics” for what he described as a politically motivated conviction. Ulbricht’s arrest in San Francisco in October 2013 became a watershed moment in the intersection of cryptocurrency and law enforcement. Using the alias “Dread Pirate Roberts,” Ulbricht launched Silk Road in 2011. The platform allowed users to buy and sell illegal goods, including drugs, using Bitcoin for anonymity. Prosecutors accused him of profiting millions in Bitcoin and charged him with drug trafficking, money laundering, and conspiracy to commit hacking. In 2015, a New York jury found Ulbricht guilty on all counts, leading to one of the harshest sentences ever handed down for such crimes. Despite many appeals, including one to the Supreme Court, Ulbricht remained imprisoned until Trump’s unexpected decision. Trump’s pardon followed a letter from Senator Rand Paul, who urged Trump to act. “I write to urge you to follow through on your stated intention to commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht. Mr. Ulbricht is serving two life sentences plus forty years without parole for nonviolent offenses related to the website he launched in early 2011. Like so many others, I am shocked by the harsh sentence imposed on this first-time offender,” Paul wrote, describing the sentence as “vastly disproportionate” to the crimes. He added that even the most notorious drug dealers using the platform received lighter penalties. Paul’s intervention is believed to have been a key in Trump’s decision to grant the pardon. The self-proclaimed ‘crypto president’ said, “The scum that worked to convict Trump were some of the same lunatics who were involved in the modern day weaponization of government against me. He was given two life sentences, plus 40 years.

39276475,https://timestabloid.com/?p=55191,1737506312,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Top Pundit Feels “Something Huge Is Coming for XRP”,https://timestabloid.com/top-pundit-feels-something-huge-is-coming-for-xrp/,"Edo Farina, CEO of Alpha Lion Academy, recently expressed a strong conviction regarding the future of XRP, stating , “I have a feeling something HUGE is coming for $XRP.” This assertion aligns with a series of significant developments surrounding XRP in recent months, which may substantiate Farina’s optimism. As of January 20, 2025, XRP is trading at $3.08, reflecting a slight decrease of 0.32% from the previous close. The cryptocurrency reached an intraday high of $3.34 and a low of $2.90. Notably, XRP achieved an all-time high of $3.40 recently, surpassing the $3.00 threshold for the first time since 2018. Regulatory Shifts and Market Trends Supporting XRP Several factors have contributed to XRP’s recent upward trajectory. The anticipation of regulatory changes under the new U.S. administration has played a pivotal role. With the inauguration of President Donald Trump, there is speculation about a shift in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) stance towards cryptocurrencies. The nomination of Paul Atkins, known for his pro-crypto views , as the new SEC Chair, suggests a potential easing of regulatory pressures. This development is particularly relevant to Ripple Labs Inc., a company engaged in a legal dispute with the SEC since 2020. The lawsuit alleged that XRP was sold as an unregistered security. However, a federal judge ruled in July 2023 that XRP is not a security when sold to the general public on digital-asset exchanges, though sales to institutional investors were considered unregistered securities transactions. The prospect of a more favorable regulatory environment under the new administration has bolstered investor confidence. Market dynamics have also played a significant role in XRP’s performance. The recent decline in the U.S. core inflation rate has led to expectations that the Federal Reserve might reduce interest rates, creating a more conducive environment for cryptocurrency investments. Furthermore, the introduction of new Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) that hold actual cryptocurrencies, rather than futures, has provided traditional investors with more accessible avenues to invest in digital assets, thereby increasing demand. Institutional Interest Driving XRP Adoption Institutional interest in XRP has seen a notable uptick. WisdomTree, a U.S.-based investment fund manager, launched the WisdomTree Physical XRP ETP on several European exchanges, including Deutsche Börse Xetra, SIX Swiss Exchange, and Euronext in Paris and Amsterdam. This Exchange-Traded Product (ETP), with a management fee of 0.50%, is the most cost-effective ETP in Europe for gaining exposure to XRP. The product is fully backed by XRP and offers dual custody for enhanced security. This move by WisdomTree reflects a growing institutional recognition of XRP’s potential. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Additionally, activist approaches toward crypto investments have emerged. GAM, a Swiss asset manager, has urged Japan’s SBI Holdings to adopt a more proactive strategy regarding its substantial cryptocurrency investments, particularly its significant holdings in Ripple Labs and XRP. GAM’s fund managers have criticized SBI for a lack of transparency and strategic direction concerning its Ripple investments, suggesting measures such as disclosing daily values of XRP holdings and establishing a public XRP coin buyback program. This activist stance underscores the increasing importance of strategic management of crypto assets by institutional investors. Edo Farina’s anticipation of XRP’s significant growth is backed by favorable regulatory prospects, positive market dynamics, and growing institutional interest. These factors collectively contribute to an optimistic outlook for XRP’s future trajectory. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Pepe Loves Bezos (PEPEBEZO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEBEZO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Loves Bezos can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Loves Bezos could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Loves Bezos launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Loves Bezos on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Loves Bezos by entering its contract address – 5fminHHGkusginuqs4jjR2qivagMWWBStM2Hs21HVLcm – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEBEZO. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|DOGE|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-22 00:42:44

The company matched its expansion to the launch of the European Union’s MiCA rules, which lay out clear regulations for crypto businesses. Robinhood Crypto Sets Foot in Spain, Boosting EU Market Presence In a recent announcement on the X platform, Robinhood revealed the launch of its crypto services in Spain as of January 2025. This expansion is part of the company’s strategy to enhance its presence within the EU and the UK’s financial markets. The entry into Spain allows Robinhood to offer its users in the region a variety of services, including crypto trading, staking, and investing. The launch coincides with Robinhood’s efforts to comply with the EU’s MiCA regulations, ensuring a regulated and secure environment for its customers. Last year, Robinhood set the stage for this expansion by introducing crypto transfer capabilities in Europe. This move allowed users to deposit and withdraw over two dozen tokens—a feature highly anticipated by its European user base.’ Co-founder of Robinhood, Vlad Tenev commented, “We remain focused on providing industry-leading products that serve far more of customers’ financial needs, gaining market share, expanding internationally, and continuing to change the industry for the better.” Apart from Robinhood’s EU expansion, another crypto exchange, CryptoCom, has made strides by securing an in-principle MiCA license . This approval allows CryptoCom to operate across all 27 EU member states under the new regulatory framework. Regulatory Challenges and Strategic Adjustments Additionally, recently, the top crypto exchange agreed to a $45 million settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over several regulatory violations. These included failing to maintain and preserve communication records, as well as neglecting to implement adequate measures to prevent identity theft. The SEC also cited insufficient cybersecurity practices as a major concern. The settlement, split between Robinhood Securities and Robinhood Financial, underscores the firm’s commitment to fortifying its operational integrity. More so, the firm’s proactive measures in addressing these challenges are crucial for maintaining trust and reliability among its users. Expanding Reach and Integrating Trending Assets As part of its continued growth strategy, Robinhood has also made a significant addition to its trading platform by listing the TRUMP meme coin on its spot trading market. This new listing, based on the Solana blockchain, diversifies the assets available on the exchange and taps into the growing interest in meme coins. The inclusion of the TRUMP meme coin will enhance user engagement and attract a broader audience. This reflects the crypto exchange ability to adapt to market trends while expanding its service offerings in Spain and across Europe.

""I just called the mother of Ross William Ulbricht to let her know that in honor of her and the Libertarian Movement, which supported me so strongly, it was my pleasure to have just signed a full and unconditional pardon of her son, Ross,"" Trump wrote on a Truth Social post. The move assures an imminent release for Ulbricht, who in 2015 was convicted of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise and distributing narcotics, along with a host of related crimes, via his operation of the darknet Silk Road marketplace. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Ulbricht's case has become a cause célèbre for many in the crypto community who note he did not himself sell drugs or other illegal items but instead operated a platform where others were allowed to transact. Then-candidate Trump promised a ""Day One"" commutation of Ulbricht's sentence last May while addressing the Libertarian Party convention The price of bitcoin (BTC) rose in the minutes following the news, possibly as the pardon, along with a flurry of executive orders over the past hours, signals the president's intention to follow through on campaign promises.

Trader Ali Martinez tells his 116,800 followers on the social media platform X that while retail investors are getting distracted by the recently launched Official Trump ( TRUMP ) memecoin, crypto whales heavily accumulated DOGE to the tune of $640.5 million in just two days. “While everyone focuses on TRUMP, whales bought 1.83 billion Dogecoin DOGE in [48 hours!]” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, DOGE is trading for $0.35. Looking at TRUMP itself, Martinez predicts that the memecoin will surge above $50 if it takes out the diagonal resistance of a falling wedge pattern. A falling wedge structure is often viewed as a bullish reversal pattern as it suggests that selling pressure is losing momentum. “TRUMP seems to be forming a falling wedge on the lower time frames, suggesting a potential consolidation toward the apex before a rebound to $54.” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, TRUMP is worth $32.48. As for the Solana ( SOL )-based meme token dogwifhat ( WIF ), the trader thinks the altcoin is moving inside a large parallel channel – a pattern suggesting that the asset is in a sideways trend as it respects both the support and resistance levels.

According to reports, the Ethereum Foundation has recently moved a substantial amount of Ether. The foundation’s transactions to move and sell its tokens became messier when one of its employees attempted to explain the situation, generating a lot of backlash. Related Reading: $24 XRP Prediction: Bitcoin Maxi Calls It Risky But Possible Ethereum’s recent transactions have occurred since Bitcoin and other top tokens have been ripping through the charts. Price-wise, Ethereum is trading between $3,200 and $3,384, which is too far from 2021’s high of $4,870. What’s Up, Ethereum Foundation? The Ethereum Foundation, the primary organization supporting the development of the blockchain, is not helping the cause. Regardless of its intention or the overriding objectives for unloading massive ETH tranches, these moves still leave a bad taste in the mouths of most holders and supporters. According to a recent post by Spot On Chain on Twitter/X, the foundation has recently moved another 100 ETH in exchange for 336,475 DAI. According to the account, the foundation sold 200 ETH tokens for $67k in the first few days of 2025 at an average cost of $3,361. The account added that ETH is 31% below its 2021 high of $4,878, while Bitcoin continues to retest its highs and currently breached the $109k level.

Stark, a popular ETH supporter, defended the foundation’s decision to sell these ETH tokens, arguing that they’re still actively using the blockchain’s native token. the EF uses Ethereum all the time, for instance to (1) swap ETH for stables (usually @CoWSwap) and (2) to pay people (grantees, team members) in stables and ETH, on mainnet and L2s. Events we run (like Devcon and Devconnect) take onchain payments and use onchain ID for tickets. — Josh Stark (@0xstark) January 20, 2025 In a Twitter/X posting, Stark explained that the foundation uses its tokens every time. These tokens buy stablecoins, pay their people in stablecoins, and support the blockchain’s events. Stark’s comments didn’t sit well with some crypto observers and commentators. Twitter/X user WazzCrypto hit Stark for using ETH “dump” as an explanation to support the foundation’s transactions. User @VelvetMilkman was disappointed with Stark, arguing that it’s a lame excuse for using the altcoins. Meanwhile, X user Trading_Axe has a more scathing, and no holds barred take on the issue: Their brains actually do not work at all. The fuck you need 300K for so urgently? What could you POSSIBLY, as the ETHEREUM FOUNDATION, when the entire world is watching, need 300K OF A PUBLIC SELL ORDER for? Mindless cockroaches.

The increasing number of comments and criticisms against the foundation has caught the attention of Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s co-founder. Buterin said the team has also explored many options, including staking their tokens. However, regulatory issues and potential problems with the hard fork prevented them from doing so. Although there’s a friendly regulatory environment right now, the risks associated with staking remain high.

39278155,https://timestabloid.com/?p=55193,1737509538,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"What is self-exclusion in online gambling, and how does it help players?",https://timestabloid.com/what-is-self-exclusion-in-online-gambling-and-how-does-it-help-players/,"Over 94 million people gamble online regularly every year. Of this number, about 25.6 percent reported having a gambling problem in 2023. This is up 101 percent from 2014, when 12.7 percent of respondents said they were addicted to gambling. As online casino games grow more accessible, so does the risk of problem gambling. Operators like Betway, governments, and regulators have turned to self-exclusion to help problem gamblers remain safe online. Let’s review what it is and how it works. What is self-exclusion? Self-exclusion is a voluntary program in which bettors can request to be banned from online gambling platforms for a given period. Many regulators and operators, like the betway casino , offer self-exclusion services to help online gamblers address and resolve problem gambling tendencies. By self-excluding from gambling platforms, you limit your exposure to gambling and reduce the harm of addiction. Self-exclusion often works in tandem with other problem gambling solutions, including: Therapy and counseling Support groups Budgetary restrictions If successful, self-exclusion can limit your risk of the impacts of addiction gambling, including emotional distress, personal relationship strains, and financial loss. Within the igaming industry, offering self-exclusion options is also a mark of a reliable operator who understands gambling risks and is willing to help you manage them. How do I self-exclude from online gambling? You can self-exclude from online gambling through an online betting website or app with self-exclusion options. Most operators opt into a regional or national exclusion scheme like Gamstop and offer self-exclusion as part of their responsible gambling package. When you self-exclude through one platform, you effectively self-exclude from all platforms registered with the scheme. You can self-exclude from online gambling temporarily or permanently, from as little as 24 hours to several months or longer. Can I access an online casino after self-excluding? Not until your exclusion period expires. When you apply for self-exclusion, the website verifies your identity and records your data, including your account details, address, and name. Once you’re locked out of your account, you cannot use these details to log back in or create a new account before the end of the exclusion period. You may also be barred from receiving gambling-related ads. Can I exclude from multiple online casinos at once? Yes. Some regions and countries have multi-operator self-exclusion schemes that allow you to self-exclude from all registered operators at once. When you self-exclude in such a region, you enter a centralized list that all operators on the scheme use to limit access to gambling services. Is self-exclusion foolproof? No. In addition to being only one part of the solution, self-exclusion is difficult to implement in the digital era. It relies primarily on your ability to recognize that you have a gambling problem and your willingness to seek help. Not all bettors have that. Even after you’ve self-excluded, you can access gambling services if you want to. Some bettors use VPNs or create accounts on non-scheme platforms. Responsible gambling in 2025 Online gambling platforms have gotten a lot better at preventing self-excluded bettors from accessing gambling services. Operators like Betway track cookies, account creation patterns, player profiles, and IP addresses to enforce and maintain self-exclusion statuses. In 2025, as regulators refocus on responsible gaming, these efforts should receive more regional, national, and international support from regulatory frameworks and policies.

Despite its commitment to decentralization, it operates as a centralized entity, with a director, a treasury, paid developers, and an inner circle. These structures, while necessary for coordination, create tensions with Ethereum's decentralized ethos. The Foundation Today It is not widely known, but the current foundation was constructed in a less than ideal way. The previous director, Ming, was ousted in a coordinated effort by a group of people who have never been publicly identified or held accountable for it. I spoke with Ming days before her removal and she assured me she had no intent of leaving. I was later given information about who was responsible for her removal, but was not given much insight as to why. I have heard that Ming was a bit of a micromanager, and that she had an intensity that rubbed some people the wrong way. I’m sure there’s truth to that, but these stories are often window dressing for deeper truths. I can infer some good-faith reasons based on the way the org has been run over the past seven years. A very important role of the organization is to protect against internal power struggles as well as external capture. These are noble goals and ones they seem to have accomplished effectively. Another major focus seems to have been minimizing the public footprint of the organization and constructing it in such a way that it would not draw the ire of governments who might hold them accountable if the political winds shifted against them. But as political winds shift, and the marketplace provides alternatives, the organization itself must adapt, both in form and function.Ethereum was in its birth a visionary project, not simply technological in nature. It pointed towards a possibility of previously unimaginable futures through the empowerment of the individual to do what had previously taken billions of dollars, thousands of people, or millions of man hours to accomplish. The Ethereum Foundation, in its current incarnation, designed to minimize threats both internal and external, has lost that vision. Lead with Vision Ethereum’s next phase demands more than just technical research and coordinating conferences. It requires visionary leadership — someone who understands not just the technology but its broader social, philosophical, and political implications. This leader must inspire a new generation of builders, connect technology with human needs, and navigate the complexities of the political landscape without compromising Ethereum’s ethos.Read more: Sam Kessler - Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin Goes On Offense Amid Major Leadership Shake-up The Ethereum whitepaper was not just a technical document; it was a beacon that allowed like-minded people to come together under a shared vision. In the face of chaos, uncertainty, and frequent conflicts, it served as a guiding light. What ensured our collective success was not the absence of challenges but the clarity of the mountaintop we were striving toward. This common vision allowed us to stay aligned even when disagreements and setbacks arose. It was an idea whose time had come—a blueprint that transcended the individuals behind it and inspired a community to persevere, innovate, and ultimately bring that vision to life. Without it, the project could have easily unraveled under the weight of its ambition. Be Transparent, Focus More on the Community Transparency is equally critical. Over the past few years, the Foundation has retreated into the shadows, leaving the community feeling disconnected. But ethereum would have been nothing without its community, and it will be nothing if it loses it. A community must be managed, curated, and cared for. It requires the onboarding of new people, with new energy, and new ideas, bound by a common vision. This also includes the teams who build on ethereum. Seize the Moment From a legal perspective, Ethereum must embrace the opportunity to engage with lawmakers. The current American political climate is uniquely favorable, and inaction now risks losing momentum. America has elected a President who not only owns ether, but has himself launched a lending protocol on top of it. As of now, we are inhabiting a political landscape which was unthinkable even a year ago, when Democrats surprised so many of us by openly declaring war on crypto, and the future seemed uncertain. There has never been a better time than now to ensure that the promise of crypto is realized. While maintaining political neutrality, the Foundation can create or promote frameworks that encourage compliance and innovation. Without these frameworks, the crypto space has been plagued by speculative ventures—ICOs, DAOs, NFTs—that skirt regulations rather than working within them to build sustainable use cases. Lead by Example The Ethereum Foundation should also consider utilizing its own technology to coordinate its operations and demonstrate the transformative potential of decentralized systems. By adopting Ethereum-based tools and protocols, the Foundation could potentially manage governance, treasury disbursements, decision-making processes, and community engagement. This approach would not only demonstrate Ethereum’s capabilities but also reinforce trust within the community by embodying the principles of decentralization and transparency that the project champions. Additionally, leveraging Ethereum’s ecosystem for coordination could serve as a real-world case study, inspiring developers and organizations to explore similar solutions. By integrating its technology into its own operations, the Foundation would highlight the real-world utility of the platform while setting a precedent for how decentralized systems can effectively manage complex organizations. Be Accountable, Build the Future Finally, financial accountability must become a priority. With $100 million spent annually, the Foundation should deliver measurable outcomes. Despite significant investment in technical research, user experience in crypto remains stagnant. Improving UX, UI, key management, and other security and usability problems isn’t insurmountable but has been severely neglected. This oversight reflects a blind spot which must be addressed before wider adoption is possible. Ethereum began as more than just a technological project—it was a visionary movement for empowering individuals to achieve what once required massive resources. That vision is at risk of being lost. To reignite it, the Foundation must embrace transparency, invest in leadership, engage the community, and step into the legal and political spotlight. Ethereum’s story is one of triumph over chaos, and a testament to the power of collective vision. To ensure its future, the Ethereum Foundation must transform itself from a reactive institution into a proactive visionary force. For ethereum. For the community. For the greater good. For the future.

The cost-per-acquisition (CPA) model facilitates earning commissions whenever a person performs a specific action, such as making a deposit. In this guide, we will explore the importance of CPA and demonstrate the benefits of becoming an affiliated partner of reliable providers like P4P Partners. What Is CPA in Affiliate Marketing? CPA refers to the commission model that enables affiliates to earn a fee for motivating players to join iGaming platforms and perform specific actions. In the online gambling industry, CPA casino affiliate programs have gained prominence due to their effectiveness in driving high-quality traffic. Understanding the commission structure associated with this type of marketing is crucial for improving the quality of promotional efforts. Affiliates typically earn a fixed amount for every player who joins a platform or app. Maximizing earnings rests upon their ability to bring high-paying customers. The size of the commissions depends on the company they cooperate with and the deposit amount. Why Choose the CPA Model in Casino Marketing? Affiliates prefer to utilize the CPA model due to its transparent payout terms. By adjusting their promotional strategies, they can find a way to increase their payouts. Driving new traffic and motivating players to maintain regular activity on a platform enables affiliates to boost their revenues. Let’s consider the key upsides to joining gambling affiliate programs: Growing earnings; An easy-to-understand multi-payment system; Clear criteria for becoming an affiliate; Predictable income; Immediate payouts; Reduced risk. The CPA model is perfectly suitable for affiliates interested in quick earnings. This approach allows them to earn 100-500 EUR per every registration and subsequent deposit. However, choosing a reliable company is necessary to earn high commissions and promote top-quality products. CPA vs. RevShare Casino Affiliate Marketing Programs Even though the CPA commission model deservedly remains popular, some people still opt for the RevShare (Revenue Share) model, as the latter allows them to earn a percentage of revenue generated by site visitors. While one-time commissions for bringing one client seem high, top-quality leads may help marketers maximize their returns if they choose the RevShare model. Before making the final decision, it’s worth comparing casino CPA and RevShare programs to select the best option. While the former enables marketers to enjoy consistent earnings, the latter may be less profitable, as commissions often change due to player preferences. CPA programs are preferred by those who prioritize bringing in new customers and do not want to depend on the level of player engagement. Choosing between CPA and RevShare models requires affiliates to analyze their favorite marketing approaches, financial goals, and willingness to deal with volatility. How to Join a CPA Casino Affiliate Program? Marketers should opt for trusted iGaming affiliate networks with many satisfied clients when looking for new income sources. Such businesses establish partnerships with well-known brands that release trendy games with enticing bonuses and incentives. Providers like P4P Partners are renowned in the industry for their spotless reputation. They offer a choice of opportunities to earn money. Follow these steps to become an affiliate: Sign up with a chosen service provider; Fill out an online form; Share links with your followers via social media and websites. With affiliate earnings reaching 250,000 EUR per month, the CPA model becomes more popular. Trusted services offer up to 50% of each first deposit to those who bring in paying customers. Becoming an affiliate is a life-changing decision that allows marketers to stabilize their financial situation and master new user acquisition skills. Famous brands like P4P Partners offer multiple payout options and have flexible conditions catering to the needs of their affiliates.

More on Chainlink Price Prediction & Injective Upgrade,https://thecoinrise.com/web3bay-leads-the-pack-as-2025s-high-roi-altcoin-more-on-chainlink-price-prediction-injective-upgrade/,"2025 might be pivotal for high-return altcoins. With Chainlink’s upbeat price forecast backed by its new Cross-Chain Token standard boosting interoperability, it’s primed for wider use. Injective’s update enhances its service by incorporating tokenized AI resources, broadening ETP options, and underlining its innovation and user reach. Both projects are gaining traction by merging advanced technology with practical uses. Enter Web3Bay, a revolutionary in decentralized e-commerce. More than a marketplace, it allows token holders to earn passively and tap into the thriving Web3 domain. Offering future staking rewards, unique loyalty benefits, and seamless Web3 integration, Web3Bay represents a significant growth avenue in blockchain commerce, an appealing choice for those eyeing expansion. Web3Bay: Pioneering Decentralized Marketplaces for Enhanced Earnings Web3Bay is changing the e-commerce landscape by launching a blockchain-based decentralized marketplace. It not only supports transactions but also gives token holders chances to earn passively and engage with the Web3 environment. An upcoming feature is staking rewards that encourage further earnings and motivate long-term token holding. Web3Bay’s current presale is in stage four, with the 3BAY token priced at $0.004562. Following a tiered price increase of 15% per stage, it’s expected to hit $0.1959 by the final phase. With over $830,000 collected, early buyers can reap a potential ROI of up to 6,430% from the initial price of $0.003. The platform also provides exclusive marketplace discounts and benefits to token holders. Additionally, Web3Bay plans to expand into NFTs and DeFi, maintaining its relevance in the expanding Web3 domain. This mix of innovative offerings and a strong presale model positions Web3Bay as a top choice for immediate and long-term blockchain market value. Chainlink Price Prediction: Anticipating Significant Growth Chainlink’s latest updates, especially the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) v1.5, are enhancing its functionality. This upgrade introduces a Cross-Chain Token (CCT) standard, simplifying the creation and management of tokens across various blockchains. This adoption is driving a positive outlook for Chainlink, with price expectations reaching up to $29 and possibly $40 if the bullish trend persists. Supporting this growth are substantial investments from institutions, with over $31 million in LINK tokens purchased since mid-January 2025, indicating strong confidence in its capabilities and future. This institutional and technical support reinforces Chainlink’s strong market position, offering promising opportunities in blockchain solutions with practical applications. Injective Upgrade: Expanding Capabilities and Accessibility The recent Injective upgrade emphasizes its commitment to broadening functionality and accessibility. Through a partnership with Aethir, Injective has incorporated tokenized GPU compute resources, enabling AI agents to work smoothly across blockchains like Solana. This development places Injective at the core of blockchain and AI integration—a sector with substantial growth prospects. Further establishing its market presence, Injective has launched new ETPs (Exchange-Traded Products) with 21Shares and Valour Funds. These products simplify access to INJ tokens and offer staking rewards, boosting holder engagement and utility. This upgrade and these new offerings underline Injective’s focus on user-centric growth and technological advancement. Key Takeaway! The advancements at Chainlink, especially the new Cross-Chain Token standard, alongside the upbeat Chainlink price forecast, hint at a strong year for LINK. Similarly, Injective’s latest update with tokenized AI resources and new ETP launches highlights its dedication to innovation and user-focused growth. Amid these updates, Web3Bay emerges as a standout in blockchain commerce. With its combination of staking rewards, loyalty benefits, and Web3 integrations, it merges e-commerce utility with real-world token benefits. For those seeking durable value in blockchain ventures, Web3Bay offers a chance to join a progressive ecosystem that melds earning potential with groundbreaking features. These initiatives underscore how blockchain continues to evolve decentralized solutions for a dynamically expanding digital economy.

39278450,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=680038,1737511218,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/39278450.jpeg,"Ethereum Appears ‘Bottomed Out,’ Analyst Predicts A Rally Is Near",https://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/ethereum-appears-bottomed-out-analyst-predicts-a-rally-is-near/,"Ethereum (ETH) appears to have ‘bottomed out,’ according to crypto analyst Mister Crypto. The analyst shared this observation as investor confidence in ETH continues to wane due to the digital asset’s relatively lackluster price performance in 2024. Is Ethereum Due For A Rally? Unlike Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL), which have surged in the past year by 146% and 154%, respectively, Ethereum has risen a modest 32% over the same period. As a result, ETH holders are understandably frustrated with the digital asset’s price action, with some whales liquidating their holdings at losses of up to $1 million. Related Reading: Will Ethereum Bounce Back? Crypto Analysts Discuss Potential Price Recovery However, some analysts now believe it may finally be time for Ethereum to break out of its stagnation. Crypto trader Mister Crypto shared the following ETH/BTC monthly chart on X, showing ETH’s price bouncing off a long-standing trendline before entering a parabolic run. This analysis aligns with a recent report highlighting ETH’s four-year low of 0.031 against BTC on the weekly chart. A potential rebound from this multi-year support level could position ETH to outperform BTC in the short term. Crypto analyst Merlijn The Trader also identified a bullish falling wedge pattern forming on Ethereum’s 2-day chart. According to Merlijn, a breakout to the upside could make Ethereum’s next move “legendary.” For the uninitiated, a bullish falling wedge is a technical chart pattern that forms when an asset’s price consolidates between two downward-sloping, converging trendlines. It typically signals a potential trend reversal or continuation, with a breakout to the upside expected once the price moves above the upper trendline. In Ethereum’s case, its price must decisively break through the $3,400 level to confirm the bullish falling wedge pattern. Failure to do so could result in ETH falling to the next major support levels at $3,000 and potentially $2,400. Finally, seasoned crypto market commentator Poseidon offered a more macro perspective on ETH’s price action. The analyst noted that Ethereum has been trading within a range for the past four years. A breakout above the critical $4,000 resistance level could propel ETH beyond $10,000, based on Fibonacci price extensions. 2025: The Year Of Altseason? A full-blown altseason typically requires ETH to lead the market. Thus, a strong 2025 for Ethereum could significantly increase the likelihood of the eagerly anticipated altseason. Fortunately, many investors are optimistic about ETH’s prospects this year. Related Reading: Ethereum Poised For A Bullish Q1 2025? Here’s What Experts Say In December 2024, analysts at brokerage firm Bernstein remarked that ETH’s risk-reward ratio has become increasingly attractive. Similarly, Steno Research predicted that ETH could outperform BTC in Q1 2025, with a price target as high as $8,000. However, the $4,000 resistance level remains ETH’s Achilles’ heel. At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $3,280, down 2.1% in the past 24 hours.

Their latest analysis shows that the Dogecoin price would drop by 59% in the coming weeks. On the other hand, they have identified WallitIQ, an AI altcoin, as the potential “Shiba Inu (SHIB) of this cycle,” having shown a similar historical pattern. The crypto community’s reaction to this prediction has raised an important question for investors: Why are memecoin whales jumping ship to WallitIQ (WLTQ) ? WallitIQ (WLTQ) Shows Promising Signs As The Next 50,000% Crypto Success Story According to Bloomberg Analysts, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has dubbed itself as the Shiba Inu (SHIB) of this cycle. The AI altcoin has flashed numerous bullish signals for a 50,000% surge by June. This once-in-a-lifetime opportunity has stirred short-term and long-term investors who want to become millionaires to join the lucrative platform. Further analysis shows that only early adopters will enjoy maximum rewards. There are several reasons WallitIQ (WLTQ) is the talk of the crypto community. From creating a highly-rewarding ecosystem to the launch of the MVP build of its Crypto Wallet Management Mobile App , WallitIQ (WLTQ) has outperformed other presale companions and established crypto projects. The affordable $0.0420 AI altcoin will spike to $21 before June. As such, whales and seasoned crypto enthusiasts are pitching their tents to secure their position before the price changes. Hence, Bloomberg analysts think WallitIQ (WLTQ) will surpass a $20 million inflow before June. The AI altcoin provides unrestricted access to sophisticated technology and numerous trading opportunities. Its all-in-one app displays transaction histories, observes real-time prices via the CoinGecko API, and manages their wallets. Its AI-powered trading automation is underway for investors who want to gain insights into exclusive data like Bloomberg analysts. Another outstanding feature of the AI altcoin is its access to over 1,000 cryptocurrencies. Beginners can employ the artificial intelligence (AI) protocol to determine a worthy investment, while long-term investors can multiply their rewards by a possible 180% APY when they stake their tokens. As the hype about the Dogecoin price plummets, WallitIQ (WLTQ) shows more promising signs as the next 50,000% crypto success story. Investors do not need to worry about the safety of their assets as WallitIQ (WLTQ) has fulfilled a smart contract audit from SolidProof. Hence, no one wants to miss the golden chance to get in and enjoy substantial profits. With only $0.0420, you can create the path to generational wealth. Several early adopters have become millionaires. With bigger rewards on the horizon, now is the right time to lock in. Buy WLTQ tokens today. Dogecoin Price Prediction: DOGE Whales Seek Another After A Possible 59% Drop The Dogecoin price has struggled in 2025 despite a strong end to 2024. In the past day, the Dogecoin price has dropped by 4.92%. As of this writing, the Dogecoin price trades below $0.4. However, Bloomberg analysts have identified this level as the beginning of a 59% drop while highlighting an AI altcoin, WallitIQ (WLTQ), as a worthy investment. The crypto community has reacted to this prediction as more whale networks have abandoned Dogecoin (DOGE) for WallitIQ (WLTQ). Can Shiba Inu (SHIB) Repeat History? Shiba Inu (SHIB) experienced a great run in October 2021. Within 2 weeks, Shiba Inu (SHIB) grew by 1163%. Bloomberg analysts said WallitIQ (WLTQ) showed a bullish pattern similar to that of Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) historical pattern. The rise of Shiba Inu (SHIB) was fostered by strong media hyper and community engagement. However, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has shown better potential.. Conclusion While the Dogecoin price faces a predicted 59% decline, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has emerged as a potential “Shiba Inu (SHIB) of this cycle.” Bloomberg analysts have spelled out the contrasting fortunes of Dogecoin (DOGE) and WallitIQ (WLTQ). This shows that the market dynamics have shifted from meme-coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), to this AI altcoin, which has cemented its position as the best presale event in crypto history. The movement of DOGE whales towards the AI altcoin shows a strategic positioning for massive growth potential. The ever-changing crypto landscape has a new star in WallitIQ (WLTQ) and its incoming uptrends. Buy the WLTQ tokens today to ride the next bull wave in the coming weeks.

Concurrently, Aave is seeing a notable increase in value following its V4 upgrade and strategic rebranding, drawing substantial interest from the DeFi community. Amidst this, BlockDAG (BDAG) is emerging as a pivotal player. With plans to list on 10 major CEXs, it is poised to make significant strides in market visibility, liquidity, and global reach. The momentum building around BDAG is palpable, raising the question of not if, but when to engage with BlockDAG as it prepares to redefine the norms of blockchain scalability. BlockDAG: On the Verge of a Major Breakthrough—Are You Positioned? BlockDAG is at a critical juncture, ready to launch on 10 key centralized exchanges (CEXs) in what is one of the most eagerly awaited events in the crypto sphere this year. This move is anticipated to significantly enhance BDAG’s market presence and adoption. For those looking ahead, now presents a strategic opportunity to get involved before BlockDAG escalates to a global scale and reaches its full potential. Having already raised $182.5 million in its presale, with 17.9 billion BDAG coins distributed, BlockDAG is capturing intense market interest. At a current presale price of $0.0248 per BDAG, early adopters are looking at a 2380% ROI, reaffirming BlockDAG’s position as one of the top bullish cryptos to buy now. With its sophisticated Phantom and GhostDAG protocols, BlockDAG offers unmatched scalability and throughput, setting it apart in the Web3 landscape. Its recent partnership with HackerEarth, which aims to engage over 15,000 developers to kickstart more than 200 projects, is likely to fortify its ecosystem further. As the presale period draws to a close and the CEX launch approaches, BlockDAG is distinguishing itself as a formidable contender in the 2025 crypto market. Virtuals Protocol: Pioneering the Next Generation of AI Agents Virtuals Protocol is elevating AI agents by enabling their tokenized ownership and monetization across various digital landscapes. In January 2025, its token reached a new peak of $4, fueled by robust adoption and demand, and it currently trades at $3.62, maintaining strong market presence. Now housing over 2,200 AI agents, with top valuations surpassing $300 million, Virtuals has bolstered its platform security, enhancing user confidence. With ambitious plans for expansion and new AI-driven tools in development, Virtuals Protocol is positioning itself as an innovative leader in blockchain technology applications, promising a bright future in the upcoming year. Aave’s Price Surge: Unpacking the DeFi Enthusiasm Aave remains a focal point in the decentralized finance arena with its latest V4 protocol enhancement, incorporating features like an emergency redemption mechanism for its GHO stablecoin to mitigate depegging risks. This initiative underscores Aave’s commitment to addressing key DeFi sector challenges. With these enhancements set for completion by mid-2025, there’s already a noticeable impact on Aave’s valuation. Furthermore, Aave’s transition to Avara and the acquisition of the crypto wallet Family have broadened its Web3 footprint. These strategic moves are not only expanding its user base but are also contributing to a surge in Aave’s market price. As Aave continues to refine its operations on platforms like Polygon, it is adopting a proactive stance in ensuring secure and scalable growth through 2025. Summing Up! Aave is reinforcing its stronghold in DeFi through its innovative V4 upgrade and strategic transition to Avara, which is mirrored in the appreciating Aave price. Likewise, Virtuals Protocol’s significant role in the decentralized application sphere, especially with its AI agents, is becoming increasingly central, highlighted by its token’s current performance. As these initiatives gain momentum, BlockDAG is poised for a landmark market entry with its upcoming debut on 10 centralized exchanges. This development is set to dramatically elevate BDAG’s liquidity and market demand, affirming its status as one of the best bullish cryptos to buy now . As BlockDAG prepares for this pivotal event, the strategic window for engagement is now.

However, he admitted he didn’t know much about its performance. While speaking to a group of reporters on Tuesday afternoon, Trump was asked about his new meme coin. He said: I don’t know much about it other than I launched it. I heard it was very successful. I haven’t checked. President Donald Trump After the comments, TRUMP fell over 30% to $34.88 but has since recovered and is now trading at $42.07 . Trump’s meme coin surges to $15B before MELANIA’s launch Trump Organization affiliate CIC Digital LLC launched the ‘TRUMP’ meme coin . The firm is linked to previous sales of crypto collectible NFTs launched in 2022 that made millions of dollars but have since fallen dramatically in value for their owners. The Solana-based meme coin was launched three days before Trump took office. The meme coin’s market cap jumped to $15 billion over the weekend, although it currently trades with a market cap around $8 billion. The coin surged from less than $10 on Saturday morning to as high as $74.59 before giving up some of its gains on Monday. One of the reporters at the Tuesday meeting mentioned that the TRUMP token had generated several billion dollars in the past few days. The president appeared shocked and responded, “Several billion?” He then dismissed the gains as insignificant. He pointed out that SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son, OpenAI’s Sam Altman, and Oracle’s Larry Ellison, who were present in the room, were worth much more. The TRUMP token dropped 50% Sunday afternoon following the news that Trump’s wife, First Lady Melania Trump, had also launched her own meme coin. Both tokens are believed to be largely owned by Trump insiders. Thanks to their high profile and social media presence, the TRUMP coin and MELANIA coin have already entered the top 100 coins in terms of value. MELANIA’s coin is now worth more than AI entrepreneur Sam Altman’s Worldcoin. Trump signs executive orders, issues pardons, and plans cryptocurrency policies On his first day in office, Trump signed multiple executive orders on energy, border security, immigration, infrastructure, and more. He pardoned Ross Ulbricht of Silk Road and 1,500 January 6 protesters, including Oath Keepers and Proud Boys. However, he did not address a promised Bitcoin strategic reserve or reverse the prior administration’s policies, which some have dubbed Operation Chokepoint 2.0. Trump is reportedly planning to issue an executive order making cryptocurrency a national policy priority and has appointed David Sacks as his administration’s crypto czar. Several exchanges and brokerages, including Coinbase and Robinhood, have listed the “official” TRUMP meme coin.

Inaugurated Trump (TRUMPINA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 12,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPINA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Inaugurated Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Inaugurated Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Inaugurated Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Inaugurated Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Inaugurated Trump by entering its contract address – 2F9Q7eZwdnfWUY6Pcqvb7KFDXVW2vcoLCDoTkzsHUvTF – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPINA.

For investors, 2025 is shaping up to be no different, with both emerging projects and established giants vying for attention. The key is figuring out which coins can deliver exponential returns and which might fall short. Qubetics is one of the rising stars of 2025, turning heads with its innovative approach as the world’s first Web3 aggregator. If you’re hunting for the best cryptos for exponential returns, Qubetics has all the markings of a market leader. Not to be outdone, Tron and Render are also making headlines. Both projects have secured their places in the crypto ecosystem, serving as reliable investments for different kinds of investors. Let’s explore what makes these three cryptos the top picks for January 2025. Qubetics: The Best Cryptos for Exponential Returns Qubetics is redefining the crypto space with its role as a Web3 aggregator . It’s a unifying platform that connects decentralized apps, users, and data across multiple blockchains. By solving one of blockchain’s biggest challenges—Qubetics has positioned itself as a game-changer for businesses, developers, and everyday users. One of Qubetics’ standout features is its ability to simplify cross-border transactions . Imagine you’re a small business owner in South America wanting to pay a supplier in Europe. Traditionally, you’d face long delays, high fees, and complex banking systems. With Qubetics, those payments happen almost instantly and at a fraction of the cost. Freelancers can also use Qubetics to manage contracts and payments globally without worrying about currency conversions or hidden fees. For developers, Qubetics’ seamless integrations mean they can build dApps that function effortlessly across Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon without worrying about compatibility issues.

With a token price of $0.0551, the project’s raised over $10.1 million, cementing its status as a must-watch crypto. The numbers tell the story. Analysts predict $TICS will hit $0.25 by the end of the best crypto presale , a 353.39% increase. Long-term projections include $1, $5, and even $15 after the mainnet launch, marking potential returns as high as 27,103.64%. For anyone looking for the best cryptos for exponential returns, Qubetics is a no-brainer. Tron: A DeFi Powerhouse Tron has built its reputation as a decentralized platform for content sharing and smart contracts. With its lightning-fast transactions and low fees, Tron has carved out a niche in the DeFi and gaming industries. Its native token, TRX, is a staple among crypto enthusiasts seeking both utility and investment potential. As of January 21, 2025, Tron’s price stands at $0.23988, with a slight dip of 0.00053% from the previous close. Beyond the numbers, Tron’s strategic partnership with Wintermute has been a game-changer. This collaboration enhances liquidity and OTC trading for TRX and other tokens within the Tron ecosystem, strengthening its DeFi presence. Adding to the intrigue, reports suggest that former U.S. President Donald Trump invested $4.7 million in TRX on his first day in office. While unconfirmed, such news adds a layer of excitement and speculation to Tron’s market dynamics. Tron’s ability to deliver scalable, low-cost solutions makes it a favorite for developers and investors alike. Whether you’re looking to trade, stake, or develop, Tron offers robust infrastructure to meet your needs. It remains a strong contender for investors seeking reliable growth.

This approach has drastically reduced costs and increased accessibility for industries like gaming, animation, and virtual reality. R ender’s price as of January 21, 2025, is $6.64, reflecting a 7.65% dip from the previous close. Despite the short-term decline, Render continues to innovate.

The announcement came through Trump’s social media platform, Truth Social, where he stated it was his “pleasure” to grant clemency to Ulbricht, who had been serving a life sentence since 2015. Ulbricht, 40, was convicted for his role in creating and running Silk Road, a dark web marketplace used for the sale of illegal drugs and other items. The pardon fulfills a promise Trump made during his presidential campaign, which gained widespread attention among libertarian activists and criminal justice reform advocates. Donald Trump Justifies Ross Ulbricht Clemency Decision President Donald Trump has stated his displeasure with the legal process that resulted in Ulbricht receiving a life sentence. In a post on the Truth Social platform, he called the sentence “ridiculous” and lambasted the actors in the case as “the same freaks” who, he alleged, conspired against him during his time in the White House. Trump said he had talked to Ulbricht’s mother during his first full day back in the White House and informed her that he would be pardoning her son. ”Ross has done enough time in jail for non-violent crimes,” said Trump. Amid this pardon, bullish momentum has resurfaced with TRUMP memecoin recovering and price soaring to $42.03, a 20% surge from the intra-day low of $32. The pardon has elicited cheers and jeers as Ulbricht’s case has been a subject of division for quite some time. Some of the people defending him say that the punishment he received was severe while others claim that the platform was used to coordinate large-scale drug distribution. However, despite the pardon, Ross Ulbricht (ROSS) token price dipped over 51% to trade at $0.01091, as of press time. Libertarian Support and Calls for Clemency The Libertarian Party has been advocating for getting leniency for Ulbricht. Chair of the Libertarian National Committee Angela McArdle said he is a “political prisoner” and praised the decision to pardon as a victory for their cause. “Ross Ulbricht has been a libertarian political prisoner for over ten years,” McArdle said in a statement. She also thanked Donald Trump for taking action, saying it was ‘a long-overdue step toward justice.’ Senator Rand Paul, who had encouraged Trump to intervene, also voiced support for a clemency for Ulbricht. Paul said that Ulbricht received a harsh sentence than the drug dealers who used the Silk Road. He pointed to several cases of car dealers getting from five to ten years behind the bars, while Ulbricht was given two life terms without a chance for parole. Ulbricht’s Time in Prison and Path to Clemency Ulbricht has spent more than 11 years in federal prison and has not violated any prison rules while serving time. According to media, he has not only spent his time in prison teaching math and science but also practicing yoga. His defense and friends have also called attention to the inconsistencies in the case such as charges for murder for hire that were dropped. His clemency lawyer Brandon Sample thanked Trump for fulfilling the promise made during his campaign saying that the decision has bought ‘relief and hope’ to Ulbricht’s family. Ulbricht’s case had not remained confined to the libertarian community only. Supporters of criminal justice reform said his punishment exemplifies what they believe is excessive punishment for non-violent crimes. Broader Context of Donald Trump’s Pardons The pardon for Ulbricht is within a list of many executive orders that Donald Trump has signed since he began his second term in office. On Monday, Trump commuted the sentences of approximately 1,500 people who have been charged in relation to the January 6 Capitol attack sparking controversies. The pardon also had support from Tesla CEO Elon Musk , a supporter of the Trump administration. He announced the decision on social media where he said, “Ross will be freed too.” Ulbricht, who founded Silk Road under the alias of Dread Pirate Roberts, was arrested in 2013 and found guilty in 2015. He was the first to offer his platform as a marketplace for purchasing goods and services using Bitcoin on the dark web.

The tweet reads, “About 98% of the people will sell their #XRP after $10-$50. I am here to see the price above $100. Who will stay with me?” The statement resonated with community members, who shared their perspectives on holding strategies and price targets. The responses highlight a significant divide in the community, ranging from conservative profit-taking approaches to ambitious long-term holding plans. Community Perspectives on Price Targets One user, Magixchirps, shared an especially bold outlook stating , “I’m here to see it past $1000 and still wouldn’t sell at that price. I have 15 years left before I reach the retirement age of a reg hard working man. So I will let it sit until I reach that number.” This comment underscores a belief in XRP’s potential to reach unprecedented price levels and a long-term investment mindset tied to personal financial goals. Magixchirps reflects a segment of investors who see XRP as a cornerstone of their retirement strategy, regardless of shorter-term price fluctuations. Another user, SunsetButterfly, offered a slightly more conservative but still optimistic perspective, she said “Above a $100 yes, but if you sell all of it, I think that is foolish. I think it’s an investment for the long term and will go way, way up.” Sunsetbutterfly’s response highlights a cautious yet forward-looking approach, advocating for partial profit-taking while retaining a substantial portion of XRP holdings for long-term growth. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 User Jiggy echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the importance of diversifying holding strategies: “Holding for the long haul. Will sell some along the way but not until we reach 3 digits. I will leave a big bag to hold for a long long long time that my kids can enjoy.” Jiggy’s viewpoint reflects a generational wealth-building philosophy, suggesting that XRP may be a valuable legacy asset for future generations. Implications for the XRP Community The variety of opinions shared in response to XRP Avengers’ tweet highlights an important debate within the XRP community . While some investors aim for more modest targets, planning to sell between $10 and $50, others are committed to holding out for triple or even quadruple-digit price levels. These divergent strategies demonstrate the wide spectrum of investor confidence and financial planning among XRP holders. As the digital asset market evolves, it remains uncertain whether XRP will achieve the ambitious price levels envisioned by its most optimistic supporters. However, the discussion underscores a broader principle in crypto investing: each individual must define their goals, risk tolerance, and timeline.

With over $10.6 million raised in its presale at a price of $0.004875, Lightchain AI is emerging as a promising project offering massive growth potential. Experts are now weighing whether this rising star could outshine XRP in the long run. Ripple’s Rise Story Behind the Surge Ripple’s cryptocurrency, XRP, has experienced a remarkable surge, reaching a six-year high of $2.49. This growth is driven by several key factors. First, expectations surrounding the resignation of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, effective January 2025, have fostered optimism for a more supportive regulatory landscape for crypto. Additionally, there is increasing speculation about the potential approval of a spot XRP Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF), which could make it easier for institutional investors to participate in the market. Lastly, the overall positive sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, largely influenced by Bitcoin’s rise, has contributed to the momentum of altcoins like XRP. Together, these factors have solidified XRP’s position as a leading cryptocurrency with strong growth potential. Lightchain AI Hidden Gem on Every Investor’s Radar While XRP focuses on cross-border payments, Lightchain AI is redefining the game by fusing artificial intelligence directly into its blockchain. This groundbreaking approach doesn’t just fix inefficiencies—it creates entirely new opportunities for growth. What makes Lightchain AI truly stand out? AI-driven scalability that uses machine learning to supercharge transaction speeds and a decentralized governance model that puts power in the hands of token holders, building trust and transparency. With its presale almost over, now’s your chance to grab tokens at a highly favorable price. Lightchain AI is shaping up to be the next big thing in crypto—don’t miss out! Smart Bet for the Future As XRP gains momentum due to its established utility, Lightchain AI is positioning itself as a transformative player in the cryptocurrency space. With innovative features, strong presale performance, and significant growth potential, it presents an attractive opportunity for investors looking to diversify beyond traditional options. Lightchain AI’s roadmap sets out a well-defined path to growth, with key milestones including the testnet launch in January 2025 and the mainnet activation in March 2025. This structured approach underscores its commitment to innovation and scalability. The LCAI token has a total supply of 10 billion, allocated as follows – 40% for presale, 28.5% for staking rewards, 15% for liquidity, 5% for marketing, 6.5% for the treasury, and 5% for the team. This carefully planned distribution supports sustainability and equitable participation within the ecosystem. For investors seeking the next major opportunity in cryptocurrency, Lightchain AI stands out as a project with the vision, technology, and momentum to achieve substantial returns. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf Tweets by LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,XRP|BUSINESS|TRADING|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-22 03:00:00

33767162,[object Object],1737514832,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Crypto Madness: REXShares And Osprey File For TRUMP, BONK, And DOGE ETFs",https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-madness-trump-bonk-and-doge-etfs/,"Amid the fervor generated by the latest launches of President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania’s memecoins, REX Shares and Osprey, have captured attention by submitting filings for ETFs associated with several of the most popular cryptos: TRUMP, Bonk Inu (BONK), and Dogecoin (DOGE). New ETFs Targeting Memecoins And Major Cryptos The filing , disclosed by James Seyffart, a Bloomberg ETF expert, also includes ETFs for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana SOL), and XRP. Notably, these products are filed under the 1940 Act, similar to crypto futures ETFs, allowing them to hold a mix of derivatives and assets through a Cayman subsidiary. Seyffart highlighted that this structure is reminiscent of strategies used in commodity ETFs, designed to minimize tax complications, particularly avoiding K-1 forms, which can allegedly complicate tax filings for investors. The newly proposed funds aim to provide exposure to their respective reference assets through investments in a subsidiary organized in the Cayman Islands, called the REX-Osprey TRUMP (Cayman) Portfolio S.P. This subsidiary will be wholly owned by the fund and is expected to hold no more than 25% of the fund’s total assets. This approach not only allows for diversified investment strategies but also helps the fund meet the income sourcing requirements established under the Internal Revenue Code. Digital Assets ETF Filings Surge To 33: Experts Predict Further Growth The fund’s structure is also classified as “non-diversified” under the Investment Company Act of 1940, allowing it greater flexibility in its investment decisions. Additionally, the fund intends to allocate its remaining assets to various cash investments such as US Treasuries, money market funds , and other high-quality cash equivalents, aimed to enhance liquidity and provide a safeguard for the fund’s investments. The momentum of these filings reflects a broader trend in the crypto market, as Eric Balchunas, Seyffart’s colleague, pointed out that the number of crypto ETFs filed with the SEC has now reached an impressive 33. The recent regulatory environment has seen a doubling of filings since Gary Gensler’s departure from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Friday, with expectations that this number could swell to 50 in the coming weeks. However, Balchunas cautions that while the influx of new ETFs is exciting, the majority of investment capital will likely continue to flow into spot Bitcoin ETFs . Balchunas likens the crypto market to the commodities sector, where gold remains dominant while silver and lesser-known commodities like palladium and aluminum occupy niche positions. In this landscape, mainstream cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are expected to attract the bulk of investment, while memecoins may find themselves in a more fringe position, the expert further asserted. At the time of writing, the President’s official memecoin, TRUMP, was trading at $39,044, down 50% from its peak of $79 over the weekend.

This notable indicator known as the Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (STH SOPR) which reveals the behavior of Short-Term Holders (STHs) has shown that STHs have started to sell at a loss. This metric compares 30-day STH SOPR to its 365-day counterpart and provides insight into whether short-term investors are realizing profits or losses. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin’s Upward Cycle Back? Key Insights Into The Latest Recovery Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Realized Losses To grasp what the Short-Term Holder’s current selling at a loss means for the market, it’s important to first understand its broader market implications. Darkfost, the CryptoQuant analyst behind the revelation of this data reveals that when STH SOPR turns negative, two scenarios often unfold “holding” and “capitulation” The analyst mentioned that some STHs may hold their BTC, using their realized price as a potential support level, while others could capitulate, triggering further corrections. Historically, these periods of STH losses have marked attractive entry points for long-term investors.

In Darkfost words: Historically, when this metric turns negative, it often highlights attractive entry points for the long term. However, it’s essential to confirm such signals by cross-referencing with other metrics and assessing the broader market sentiment. MVRV Ratio Highlights Potential Market Trends Besides the STH realized losses suggesting potential attractive entry points for long-term investors, Bitcoin’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio has also indicated an interesting trend incoming for Bitcoin. Another CryptoQuant analyst known as Tugbachain recently shared in a post on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform that currently, the MVRV ratio stands at 2.4, and it is approaching a key support level. If it breaks below this support and then reverses its downtrend, it could climb back into the 4-6 range historically associated with Bitcoin peaks, the analyst reveals. For context, the MVRV ratio is an indicator that measures whether a cryptocurrency is overvalued or undervalued by comparing its market capitalization to the value at which it was last moved.

According to Tugbachain, over multiple halving cycles, the MVRV ratio has proven to be a reliable tool for identifying market tops and bottoms, as well as shorter-term fluctuations adding credibility to the latest indication.

Pro-XRP Lawyer John Deaton Weighs In,https://coinpedia.org/news/is-trumps-meme-coin-a-threat-to-cryptos-future-pro-xrp-lawyer-john-deaton-weighs-in/,"The post Is Trump’s Meme Coin a Threat to Crypto’s Future? Pro-XRP Lawyer John Deaton Weighs In appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Attorney John Deaton recently shared his thoughts on the launch of the Trump meme coin. The crypto community is split and some people believe Trump’s meme coin will attract new investors and help crypto gain more acceptance. Others, like Deaton, are worried that it could harm the industry’s credibility. For Deaton, the issue isn’t the meme coins themselves but the broader implications they have for the crypto industry’s reputation. On the Good Morning Crypto Show, he warned that while meme coins can attract attention and investors, they may also contribute to the public perception of crypto as a “casino” or speculative market, rather than a legitimate technology with real-world utility. Deaton’s concern is that if meme coins dominate the conversation, it could overshadow the more serious and transformative potential of blockchain technology. “I think we’ve been fighting for crypto survival for the past five years, but now we have to fight for legitimacy,” he said. Deaton fears that if the industry doesn’t push for real utility and focus on solving world problems, it may become mired in hype and speculation. Looking Ahead “We must not just survive, but serve,” he said, stressing the importance of pushing for blockchain technology that can truly solve global problems. If meme coins like Trump continue to dominate, the public perception of crypto could shift towards viewing it as a speculative gamble. He believes that the new leadership could allow for a more balanced approach to crypto regulation, one that doesn’t unfairly target legitimate projects like Ripple, Coinbase, and others. “We witnessed a war against crypto. But I have a concern and my concern is that in this country sometimes we have this tendency to go from one extreme to the other extreme. So we’ve had this completely unfair war against crypto and that doesn’t mean we want complete freedom for all where there are no rules, no regulations,” Deaton said.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,TECHNOLOGY|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-22 03:06:24

Among the emerging stars in this space, meme coins have carved out a unique identity, blending humour and community spirit to attract investors. Initially laughed off as mere jokes, these coins have proven their worth, demonstrating that they can provide real financial opportunities. As the market expands, meme coins are increasingly recognised as vital components of the economic landscape. Over the years, the popularity of meme coins has surged, thanks to their viral nature and community-driven ethos. Coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have paved the way, sparking interest from casual investors and crypto enthusiasts alike. Now, BTFD Coin is stepping into the limelight, poised to elevate meme coin popularity to unprecedented heights. With its play-to-earn (P2E) game , enticing referral programme, and rewarding staking options, BTFD Coin is all about harnessing community power to create value for its holders. In this article, we’ll dive into the world of BTFD Coin, Mog Coin, and Neiro, exploring each project in detail. These coins are among the best new meme coins with 100x potential, each bringing unique features and opportunities to the table. But which one should you put your money on? Let’s explore! BTFD Coin: A Presale Wonder BTFD Coin is making headlines for all the right reasons. It’s been a hot topic in the crypto community, especially with its presale performance, which has already surpassed a staggering $5.4 million in just the first month. Currently priced at $0.00016, BTFD Coin has ignited excitement among investors. But hold onto your hats, because there’s more! The presale is skipping straight to Stage 15, meaning all unsold tokens from previous stages will be burnt, drastically reducing supply. This is a big deal! Fewer tokens mean stronger demand, and the buzz around BTFD Coin is palpable. And let’s not forget the incredible bonus offer: use the code LAUNCH100 during the presale to double your tokens! If you’re searching for the best new meme coins with 100x potential, this is an opportunity you can’t afford to miss. How To Claim LAUNCH100 Bonus Code Claiming the LAUNCH100 bonus is a breeze! First, visit the presale page at Buy BTFD Coin . Connect your wallet by clicking “Connect Wallet” and select either MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Next, find the bonus code field, enter LAUNCH100 in ALL CAPS, and hit “Apply.” Confirm the message in your wallet to activate the code. Then, input how much $BTFD you want to purchase, click “Buy Now,” and, Confirm the transaction. It’s that simple! This bonus offers a fantastic chance to significantly increase your holdings. Don’t let this slip through your fingers; the clock is ticking! Mog Coin: In The Green Mog Coin is another contender in the meme coin arena, and it’s been holding its ground quite well. While it might not have the explosive growth of BTFD Coin, Mog Coin is certainly in the green, steadily gaining traction. Its branding is clever, tapping into the meme culture in a way that’s relatable to younger audiences. What sets Mog Coin apart is its focus on community and utility. Unlike some meme coins that thrive solely on hype, Mog Coin offers tangible benefits, including staking rewards and governance features. This approach not only fosters a loyal community but also encourages users to invest long-term. For those looking for stability among the best new meme coins with 100x potential, Mog Coin may just hit the sweet spot. However, while Mog Coin’s performance is commendable, it may not deliver the rapid gains some investors hope for. It’s a solid option for those who appreciate a more gradual growth strategy and want to be part of something meaningful. The community-driven nature of Mog Coin is appealing, especially for those who want to feel connected to their investments. Additionally, as the crypto market continues to evolve, Mog Coin could very well surprise us. If it ramps up its marketing and community engagement, it might just become a sleeper hit among the best new meme coins with 100x potential. Neiro: A Rising Star Let’s turn our attention to Neiro, which is carving out its niche as a rising star in the meme coin market. It’s gaining momentum and positioning itself as one of the best new meme coins with 100x potential. Neiro combines fun and utility, creating an engaging experience for its community. Neiro’s vision goes beyond being just another meme coin. It aims to create an interactive ecosystem where users can participate in various activities, from gaming to social engagement. This multifaceted approach keeps the community invested and engaged, which is crucial for long-term success. The more users interact with the platform, the more they’ll want to hold onto their tokens, driving demand. What’s exciting about Neiro is its growth potential. If it continues to innovate and maintain strong community engagement, it could easily become a favourite among investors. For those looking for something that offers both fun and functionality, Neiro might just be the ticket. It’s all about finding that balance between hype and substance, and Neiro seems to be striking the right chords. As we look to the future, Neiro’s potential seems strong. If it can capitalize on current trends and keep its community engaged, it could become one of the best new meme coins with 100x potential, making it a worthy consideration for investors. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin clearly stands out as the leader among the best new meme coins with 100x potential. Its remarkable presale performance, innovative features, and community-driven ethos make it an appealing choice for anyone looking to invest. With over $5.4 million raised and an enticing bonus offer, the opportunity for significant returns is undeniable. While Mog Coin and Neiro each have their strengths, they currently lag behind the momentum that BTFD Coin has built. Don’t miss out on the chance to join a project that’s poised for greatness.

In a landmark decision that sent waves through the Bitcoin community, President Donald Trump has granted a full and unconditional pardon to Ross Ulbricht, the creator of the Silk Road darknet marketplace. Delivered on January 21, 2025—one day later than his campaign promise—this pardon goes beyond merely commuting Ulbricht’s sentence. It’s a symbolic gesture, perhaps acknowledging the delay with goodwill. For Bitcoiners, this represents more than justice for one man—it’s a signal of potential alignment between the administration and the values Bitcoin embodies. The pardon follows a flurry of executive orders signed on Trump’s first day back in office, underscoring the administration’s focus on a myriad of national priorities. However, this act stands out, particularly for Bitcoiners, as a commitment to keeping promises, sparking hope for pro-Bitcoin legislation and progress on issues like the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Ross Ulbricht’s Silk Road wasn’t just a marketplace—it was Bitcoin’s first major use case. Launched in 2011, when Bitcoin was still in its infancy, the Silk Road demonstrated the revolutionary potential of decentralized, censorship-resistant money. While its operations drew criticism for facilitating illicit trade, it also showcased Bitcoin’s ability to enable peer-to-peer, anonymous transactions. Ulbricht’s double life sentence became a symbol of overreach—a clash between an inflexible system and the frontier spirit of technological innovation. For many in the Bitcoin community, his case represented the broader struggle for autonomy, privacy, and the freedom to innovate. His pardon is now being celebrated as a victory for these principles. The news of Ulbricht’s pardon has energized Bitcoiners, but it also highlights unresolved issues. The Samourai Wallet developers could still face prison time for developing Bitcoin privacy tools. Edward Snowden, another figure celebrated within the Bitcoin community, remains in exile. (Snowden’s revelations about mass surveillance have made him a key voice at Bitcoin conferences, aligning his values with the ethos of financial and personal privacy that Bitcoin embodies.) While Ulbricht’s freedom is a win, the incomplete picture of justice for figures like the Samourai Wallet developers and Snowden reminds us of the broader challenges in protecting digital rights. Ulbricht’s pardon is a significant moment, not just for him but for what it represents: A possible shift in how innovators and pioneers are treated when they challenge existing norms. It also signals that the current administration may be open to reevaluating policies around technology and privacy—issues that deeply resonate with Bitcoiners. The Bitcoin community’s long-standing support for Ulbricht underscores the movement’s commitment to privacy, autonomy, and resistance to overreach. Yet, as celebrations continue, there’s recognition that this is just one step in a larger journey toward protecting those who push the boundaries of innovation. For Bitcoiners, this moment is both a celebration and a rallying cry—a signal to keep pushing for a future where technology empowers individuals and where justice and innovation can coexist.

Ulbricht was serving a life sentence after being convicted for running the platform, which facilitated over $200 million in illegal transactions, including drug sales, using Bitcoin. Trump shared the news on Truth Social, revealing that he personally called Ulbricht’s mother to inform her of the decision. The president said that the pardon was granted in honor of her and the libertarian movement, which had supported him. He also criticized those responsible for Ulbricht’s conviction and said “The scum that worked to convict him were some of the same lunatics who were involved in the modern day weaponization of the government against me.” Background of Ross Ulbricht and Silk Road Ross Ulbricht, born in 1984, created Silk Road, an online marketplace that operated on the dark web. His platform gained worldwide attention for enabling anonymous, unregulated trade in illegal substances, which ultimately led to his arrest in 2013. Ulbricht was convicted in 2015 on multiple charges, including conspiracy to traffic narcotics, money laundering, and computer hacking, receiving two life sentences without the possibility of parole. Silk Road’s existence posed challenges to law enforcement, raising questions about digital privacy, free markets, and the balance between technology and regulation. Despite the illegal activities, Ulbricht’s supporters argue that his life sentence was excessively harsh, especially considering his lack of a prior criminal record. The decision to pardon Ulbricht has sparked mixed reactions, with some praising Trump’s stance on criminal justice reform and others questioning the message it sends regarding accountability for illegal actions. Ulbricht’s case has been a major topic of debate for years, with many in the crypto and libertarian communities advocating for his release.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BTC|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-22 03:26:02

ETH is consolidating above $3,150 and might aim for an upside break. Ethereum failed to gain pace for a close above $3,400 and $3,450. The price is trading above $3,300 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key contracting triangle forming with resistance at $3,355 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears the $3,400 resistance level. Ethereum Price Aims Key Upside Break Ethereum price started a decent upward move from the $3,200 level but upsides were limited compared to Bitcoin . ETH cleared the $3,250 resistance to move into a short-term bullish zone. The bulls were able to push the price above the $3,300 resistance zone. Besides, there was a clear move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,445 swing high to the $3,203 low. However, the bears are still active below $3,400. Ethereum price is now trading above $3,300 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $3,350 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,445 swing high to the $3,203 low. There is also a key contracting triangle forming with resistance at $3,355 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The first major resistance is near the $3,400 level. The main resistance is now forming near $3,445. A clear move above the $3,445 resistance might send the price toward the $3,550 resistance. An upside break above the $3,550 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,650 resistance zone or even $3,720 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,400 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,300 level. The first major support sits near the $3,250. A clear move below the $3,250 support might push the price toward the $3,200 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,120 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,050. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.

Elon Musk Salute (MUSKSAL), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKSAL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Elon Musk Salute can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Musk Salute could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Musk Salute launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Musk Salute on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Musk Salute by entering its contract address – GmFHmHWARyCD1FHVHiCc3kXZPwCDvzR5gFu2sFeeGphP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKSAL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-22 03:32:00

This frenzy has caught the attention of billionaire investor Mark Cuban, who is now contemplating the creation of his own memecoin, inspired by the recent memecoin movements. Cuban’s Memecoin Vision: Combining Fun And Financial Responsibility? In a recent social media post, the renowned billionaire opened the door to the possibility of launching a new memecoin, stating, “If memecoins are the way, maybe I’ll issue one.” His announcement has stirred curiosity among crypto enthusiasts, particularly as he hinted that his memecoin would mirror the parameters of Trump’s TRUMP memecoin. Related Reading: Is It Time To Give Up On Ethereum Below $4,000? Analyst Weighs The Facts Cuban plans to implement a 20% float and adhere to a similar release schedule, with one significant distinction: all potential revenue generated from the sale would be directed to the US Treasury. To enhance transparency, Cuban also indicated that the wallet address would be publicly accessible, allowing anyone to track the funds. Cuban framed his initiative as a way to combine entertainment with a social purpose, noting, “If you want to gamble, gamble. But at least use it to make a dent in the US debt.” This statement reflects a growing sentiment among some investors that memecoins can serve a dual purpose—providing both amusement and potential benefits to broader societal issues. However, Cuban’s proposal has not been without its critics. Cuban Cites Dogecoin Success In response to Cuban’s announcement, a user on X (formerly Twitter) cautioned him about the potential pitfalls of launching a memecoin, suggesting that he might be accused of exploiting information asymmetry at the coin’s launch. The user stressed that the supposed memecoin’s price would be dictated by supply and demand dynamics, starting from nearly zero, and warned Cuban not to proceed without careful consideration. Cuban, undeterred by the criticism, defended his understanding of the memecoin landscape, stating, “It’s not hard to put it together. I never have thought about doing a meme coin. Wouldn’t be hard at all.” Related Reading: Big Players Bet Big On XRP, Solana With Excitement Around Donald Trump’s Presidency, Here Are The Figures The back-and-forth dialogue continued, with the user asserting that creating a sustainable memecoin that benefits long-term holders is a challenging endeavor. He further argued that successful memecoins often emerge from community-driven initiatives rather than top-down launches, warning that hype surrounding a celebrity-backed launch could lead to short-term trading rather than fostering an organic community. Cuban concluded the exchange by acknowledging the importance of community in the longevity of memecoins. He cited examples like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), which have thrived due to their strong communities. “I’m not saying buyers won’t get rekt. I said it was gambling. It’s a game of musical chairs. No promises. No pumps by me. Just complete transparency,” he emphasized. At the time of writing, the TRUMP memecoin is trading at $44,778, recording a 14% recovery in the past 24 hours after plunging over 50% from its $79 peak reached over the weekend.
