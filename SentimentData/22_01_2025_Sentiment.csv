Recent Cardano news highlights its collaboration with FC Barcelona under the ""Barça Vision"" initiative, showcasing how blockchain technology is enhancing fan engagement through ADA rewards and NFT offerings. On the other hand, Fantom price remains under scrutiny as the platform works to regain stability following significant sell-offs by major holders, raising concerns about its future price trajectory. Amid these developments, BlockDAG (BDAG) is coming out ahead, with a bold vision that includes fostering over 200 Web3 projects and launching global hackathons in partnership with HackerEarth. By tapping into HackerEarth's network of 7.6 million developers, BlockDAG is dedicating itself to laying down the infrastructure for large-scale decentralized innovation. Having already raised over $182.5 million in its presale, with BDAG coins priced attractively at $0.0248, it's carving out a promising niche for buyers looking for significant returns. Cardano News: FC Barcelona Partnership Aims to Reshape Fan Experience In recent Cardano news, the cryptocurrency has stepped into the sports arena through a significant partnership with FC Barcelona, unveiled under the club's ""Barça Vision"" project on January 10, 2025. This collaboration seeks to revolutionize fan interaction by integrating blockchain tech to offer new job prospects, blockchain education, and a rewards system packed with ADA tokens and NFTs. This announcement gave Cardano's ADA token a nice 4% bump to $0.95, despite a tough market week that saw it slide down 11%. Cardano continues to hold strong as the world's 9th largest cryptocurrency by market cap, which currently stands at $33.5 billion, signaling a robust and expanding ecosystem. This venture highlights the transformative potential of blockchain in professional sports, showcasing ADA's critical role. The growing use cases and adoption rates offer exciting opportunities for those investing in innovative digital assets. Fantom (FTM) Price Faces Challenges Amid Whale Activity The Fantom price has seen a modest 3% recovery in the last 24 hours, but it's still down by 20% over the past week, struggling to reverse a bearish trend. The Average Directional Index (ADX), a tool for measuring trend strength, points to a weakening downtrend at 31.4, suggesting the market could be moving towards stabilization. Compounding the issue, there’s been a notable decline in activity from large holders, increasing selling pressure. The count of wallets holding between 1 million and 10 million FTM dropped from 84 to 69 in just one week, impacting the coin's liquidity. Currently, Fantom's price is wavering around $0.618 at a crucial support point. Falling below this could push prices down to test $0.50, while any recovery effort could send it climbing towards the $0.879 resistance level. Fantom continues to be a coin worth watching as it aims to regain stability and momentum. BlockDAG’s Bold Strategy: 200+ Web3 Projects & Worldwide Hackathons Looking ahead, BlockDAG is prepping for a groundbreaking year with extensive plans, including a significant alliance with HackerEarth. This partnership will facilitate four global hackathons aimed at engaging between 10,000 to 15,000 developers from HackerEarth’s comprehensive network of 7.6 million tech experts. These hackathons are crafted to spur innovation and foster a vibrant global community of developers. BlockDAG's overarching ambition is to stimulate the development of more than 200 Web3 projects within its ecosystem, giving developers the tools to innovate, test, and deploy cutting-edge decentralized applications (dApps), while showcasing what the BlockDAG Network can do. With a detailed roadmap and a visionary outlook for the future, BlockDAG is positioning itself as an increasingly appealing buying option. Market analysts estimate that BDAG, currently priced at $0.0248, could potentially soar to $1 by 2025. Its sophisticated technology, burgeoning ecosystem, and practical utility are catching the eyes of buyers eager for top-tier opportunities in today's crypto market. And the momentum is only building. BlockDAG’s presale has already netted over $182.5 million and is quickly advancing toward its $600 million target. As more developers join the ecosystem and drive its expansion, BlockDAG is affirming its role as a pivotal player in the Web3 domain. The outlook is bright for both developers and users venturing into the decentralized opportunities that BlockDAG offers. Best Altcoins For 2025 As Cardano and Fantom each navigate their unique challenges and opportunities, BlockDAG emerges as the standout blockchain platform for growth and innovation. Its ambitious initiatives, including organizing hackathons and expanding its Web3 project ecosystem, demonstrate its dedication to scalability and practical utility. Market experts forecast that BDAG could hit $1 by 2025, buoyed by its solid presale results and a strategy centered around developer engagement.

Recent Cardano updates spotlight its strategic collaboration with FC Barcelona through the ""Barça Vision"" project, demonstrating how blockchain is elevating fan interactions with ADA rewards and NFTs. Conversely, the price of Fantom is under examination as the platform strives to regain footing after major holders undertook significant sell-offs, sparking concerns about its future pricing path. In the midst of these shifts, BlockDAG (BDAG) is making notable strides with an ambitious plan to support over 200 Web3 initiatives and host global hackathons in collaboration with HackerEarth. By leveraging HackerEarth's extensive network of 7.6 million developers, BlockDAG is committed to establishing the groundwork for widespread decentralized innovation. Having successfully raised over $182.5 million in its presale, with BDAG coins attractively priced at $0.0248, it's creating a lucrative opportunity for investors seeking substantial returns.

This endeavor underscores the transformative power of blockchain in professional sports, highlighting ADA's essential role. Increasing use cases and adoption rates present thrilling prospects for those investing in digital assets at the forefront of innovation. Fantom (FTM) Price Under Pressure from Large-Scale Selling Fantom's price has shown a slight 3% recovery over the past day, but it remains down by 20% for the week, struggling against a bearish trend. The Average Directional Index (ADX), which measures trend strength, indicates a weakening downtrend at 31.4, hinting that the market might be stabilizing. Adding to the challenges, there's been a noticeable reduction in activity from large holders, exerting further selling pressure. The number of wallets holding between 1 million and 10 million FTM decreased from 84 to 69 in just a week, affecting the coin's liquidity. Currently, Fantom's price hovers around $0.618, a critical support level. Dropping below this could drive prices down to test $0.50, whereas a recovery effort might propel it towards the $0.879 resistance. Fantom remains a cryptocurrency to monitor as it seeks to regain stability and upward momentum. BlockDAG's Ambitious Agenda: Launching 200+ Web3 Projects with Global Hackathons Looking forward, BlockDAG is gearing up for a transformative year, marked by a major partnership with HackerEarth.

Elon Musk Salute (MUSKSAL), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKSAL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Elon Musk Salute can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Musk Salute could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Musk Salute launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Musk Salute on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Musk Salute by entering its contract address – GmFHmHWARyCD1FHVHiCc3kXZPwCDvzR5gFu2sFeeGphP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKSAL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-21 23:29:15

Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Jan. 21st, Brian reportedly told Yahoo Finance that Trump’s enthusiasm for Bitcoin proves his ambition to make America the “crypto capital of the planet.” “He really wants to be the first Bitcoin president,” Brian said, adding that his meetings with Trump before and after the election focused on the crypto industry’s potential. The Coinbase CEO explained that just as the U.S. holds reserves in gold, oil, and rare minerals like palladium, Bitcoin is the next logical step. “The world is moving to a Bitcoin standard for money. Any government that holds gold should also hold Bitcoin as a reserve. President Trump gets that.” The First Family’s crypto venture Last Friday, the president launched his meme coin Official Trump (TRUMP), marketed with the slogan, “Join the Trump Community. This is History in the Making!” The coin, developed by CIC Digital, an affiliate of the Trump Organization, has a carefully managed supply structure. The official website shows that CIC Digital and its affiliates own 80% of the total supply, with new tokens scheduled for release over three years. Affiliates will reportedly earn revenue from trading fees as tokens are sold. Within 48 hours of its launch, the TRUMP meme coin reached a $73 billion market cap, briefly surpassing Dogecoin as the largest meme coin. However, its valuation has since dropped to $7.3 billion, according to current data from CoinMarketCap. The very next day, First Lady Melania Trump launched her own meme coin, Melania Meme (MELANIA), which currently holds a $732 million market cap. As Cryptopolitan reported, government ethics watchdogs have raised concerns about the Trump family profiting from their political positions. Despite the backlash though, industry analysts see this as a turning point. Asset manager Bernstein, said, “The launch of a meme coin by the biggest political figure in the world is a massive paradigm shift in how governments view crypto. This could be the beginning of direct engagement with the masses through blockchain technology.” Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis, a proud and renowned Bitcoin supporter in Congress, introduced the Bitcoin Act of 2024 in July to establish a reserve holding 200,000 Bitcoins, worth $2.1 billion at current prices. After Trump’s November 5 win, she tweeted, “We are going to build a strategic Bitcoin reserve.” Yesterday, Lummis met with Eric Trump at the Capitol to discuss plans for the reserve, according to Bloomberg. Eric then took to social media, urging investors to “bet on crypto” as part of their belief in America’s limitless potential. “No question Biden left a mess, but that mess will be corrected, and the next four years are going to be spectacular,” he said, predicting “transformational wealth” under his Dad’s leadership.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. While PEPE and Solana’s Fartcoin target gains, PropiChain is set to steal the spotlight with its potential rise from $0.01 to $3. Table of Contents PEPE and Solana’s Fartcoin PropiChain Why PropiChain could rise from $0.01 to $3 PropiChain’s unique features The PropiChain presale The crypto market is dynamic as ever, with meme coins like PEPE and Solana’s Fartcoin capturing the spotlight with their price surges. Often rooted in humor and online culture, these projects have gained traction among retail investors seeking quick profits. While PEPE aims to use its established meme status, Fartcoin capitalizes on Solana’s high-performance blockchain to drive interest. Both PEPE and Fartcoin have set ambitious targets, drawing attention to their potential. However, their speculative nature raises questions about long-term sustainability. Amid the hype surrounding these meme coins, PropiChain (PCHAIN) is emerging as a serious contender for the top gainer position in the crypto space in Q2 2025. Market experts say PCHAIN is poised to rally from $0.01 to $3. Focused on transforming the real estate industry, estimated to be worth $600 trillion, through blockchain technology, PropiChain offers a utility-driven narrative. PEPE and Solana’s Fartcoin PEPE has become a standout player in the memecoin ecosystem. While the memecoin has evolved into a symbol of community-driven crypto success, the volatile nature of meme-based assets still poses a big concern for investors. The Solana ecosystem has birthed many projects, but few are as notable as Fartcoin . Combining humor with innovation, Solana’s Fartcoin has captured attention with its playful branding and unique tokenomics. Fartcoin’s rise is attributed to its viral marketing campaigns and a strong push from influencers. PropiChain While PEPE and Fartcoin thrive on humor and virality, PCHAIN is carving a niche in the rapidly growing tokenized real estate market. Launched to democratize property ownership, PCHAIN enables users to invest in fractional shares of real estate assets through blockchain technology. The emphasis on tangible utility and real-world application sets PCHAIN apart from meme-based assets. The platform is thus poised to capture a percentage of the $600 trillion real estate market. By deploying blockchain’s transparency and efficiency, PCHAIN aims to lower barriers to entry for real estate investment while providing liquidity to a traditionally illiquid market. Why PropiChain could rise from $0.01 to $3 PCHAIN is positioned for a massive rally that could see early presale investors enjoy over 29,000% ROI. Growing demand for tokenized assets The tokenization of real-world assets is gaining significant traction, with the market projected to hit $16 trillion. PropiChain is well-positioned to capitalize on this shift, offering an easy-to-use platform for both retail and institutional investors. Strategic partnerships PropiChain’s collaborations with established players in the real estate industry add credibility to its model. These partnerships are expected to drive adoption and increase the value of its native token, PCHAIN. Market sentiment As the broader crypto market looks for projects with real-world utility, PCHAIN’s value proposition stands out. You might also like: Promising crypto presale to invest in with potential SHIB style rally in 2025 PropiChain’s unique features PropiChain aims to reshape the real estate industry by using advanced technology to redefine property transactions. The platform will set new standards for buying, selling, and investing in real estate globally with four transformative features: Immersive virtual property exploration The platform will transform how investors and buyers scout properties using cutting-edge Metaverse technology. It will facilitate remote property exploration through immersive 3D virtual tours, overcoming geographical limitations and making real estate investment accessible to a wider audience. By enabling real-time property assessments without physical visits, investors can save time and money. Smart contracts for automated and secure transactions The platform will utilize blockchain-based smart contracts to automate critical real estate processes. These self-executing digital agreements can handle tasks such as ownership transfers, lease management & agreement, and rental payments, significantly reducing the need for intermediaries like brokers and agents. AI-driven investment insights The platform will incorporate artificial intelligence to optimize real estate investment strategies. Its AI-powered virtual assistants and chatbots will provide round-the-clock support, helping investors navigate the real estate market seamlessly. Additionally, its predictive AI system will analyze market trends, predict property value changes, and deliver data-driven recommendations. These insights empower investors to make informed decisions, boosting profitability while minimizing risks. Real estate tokenization for broader investment opportunities PCHAIN will enable the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA), turning physical properties into digital tokens. This approach will allow for fractional ownership of high-value real estate, increasing market liquidity and democratizing access to property investments. The PropiChain presale PropiChain’s focus on real-world utility combined and its potential rally from $0.011 to $3 positions it for the top-gamer position in 2025. The project raised over $1.3 million in the first presale round and has already crossed the $970,000 mark in the ongoing second presale round. This underscores the high confidence of investors in the project’s potential. After this presale round, the token price will rise by over 109% for the third and final presale round. The token is listed on CoinMarketCap , a statement of the project’s readiness to do bigger things in the crypto space. Additionally, BlockAudit , a top blockchain security company, audited the project’s smart contract and certified that it has no vulnerability.

His decision is said to stem from a desire to run for governor of Ohio next year, with the current occupant of the seat, Mike DeWine, ineligible for reelection in 2026 since he is serving his second four-year term in office. A Political Pivot for Ramaswamy It is not the first time Ramaswamy has shown interest in high-profile political roles, having sought the Republican nomination for president in 2024. He had also shown interest in succeeding Vice President JD Vance as the senator for Ohio before Governor DeWine selected his deputy, Jon Husted, to fill the vacancy. His departure from D.O.G.E, first reported by The Associated Press, is in line with the department’s new structural guidelines, which require members to step back from active roles if pursuing elected office. The Cincinnati native has been a vocal advocate for crypto, criticizing the regulatory approach to the assets in the U.S. and even accusing the Biden administration and Wall Street of trying to “suppress” the industry. He praised Grayscale’s victory against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) when it wanted to convert its Bitcoin Trust into a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF), saying the win made it possible to keep BTC and blockchain innovations in the U.S. instead of pushing them overseas. Towards the end of last year, his company, Strive Asset Management, filed for a BTC bond ETF with the SEC that would provide institutional investors and everyday Americans easy access to financial instruments based on the number one cryptocurrency. Musk Left as Sole Leader President Donald Trump appointed the 38-year-old to lead DOGE alongside Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk soon after winning the elections in late 2024. Launched under his “Save America” agenda, Trump formally established the task force via an executive order on the day of his inauguration. It aims to modernize the federal government’s operations by slashing inefficiencies, reducing regulatory red tape, and streamlining government spending. Alongside its bold goals, the initiative drew attention due to its playful acronym, which is similar to the ticker of the largest meme coin by market capitalization, Dogecoin. Incidentally, Musk, who is now its sole leader, is a long-term supporter of Dogecoin, even earning the nickname “Dogefather” for his endorsement of the token. The billionaire businessman recently proposed a public “leaderboard” that would highlight the most egregious examples of government inefficiency, an idea he described as “tragic” and “entertaining.” The post Vivek Ramaswamy Resigns as D.O.G.E Co-Lead to Run for Ohio Governor: Report appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Elon Musk|United States|Vivek Ramaswamy,EN,0,0,DOGE|REGULATION|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-01-21 23:51:43

According to recent Cardano news, its partnership with FC Barcelona through the “Barça Vision” initiative emphasizes blockchain’s critical role in enhancing fan experiences with ADA rewards and NFTs. Meanwhile, Fantom is striving to stabilize its market position, as significant sell-offs by major holders have brought Fantom price volatility into focus. BlockDAG (BDAG) , however, stands out with its ambitious roadmap aimed at nurturing over 200 Web3 projects and organizing global hackathons in collaboration with HackerEarth. Utilizing a vast network of 7.6 million developers, BlockDAG is diligently laying the groundwork for scalable decentralized innovation. With a presale that has amassed over $182 million and BDAG coins currently priced at $0.0248, it represents a prime opportunity for buyers seeking significant returns. Cardano News: FC Barcelona Partnership Aims to Enhance Fan Engagement Recent Cardano news has seen it penetrate the sports sector through a partnership with FC Barcelona, unveiled on January 10, 2025, under the club’s “Barça Vision” initiative. This partnership is set to revolutionize fan engagement by leveraging blockchain technology to offer new employment opportunities, educational initiatives in blockchain, and a rewards system featuring ADA tokens and NFTs. This announcement propelled Cardano’s ADA token up by 4%, reaching $0.95, despite facing a 11% decline earlier in the week due to broader market conditions. Cardano continues to hold its position as the 9th largest cryptocurrency globally, with a market cap of $33.5 billion, indicating a growing ecosystem. This collaboration underscores the transformative potential of blockchain in professional sports, with ADA playing an integral role. Its practical applications and increasing adoption offer substantial growth opportunities for stakeholders in cutting-edge digital assets. Fantom (FTM) Price Encounters Challenges Amid Whale Sell-Off Fantom’s price has experienced a slight 3% recovery in the last 24 hours, though it remains down 20% over the past week as it attempts to counter a prevailing bearish trend. The Average Directional Index (ADX), which quantifies trend strength, has decreased to 31.4, indicating a weakening of the downtrend and a potential shift towards market stabilization. Further, a significant reduction in large holder activity has heightened selling pressure, with the number of wallets holding between 1 million and 10 million FTM decreasing from 84 to 69 over the week, impacting market liquidity. Fantom’s price is now teetering around $0.618 at a pivotal support level. Should it fall below, the price might test the lower support at $0.50; conversely, a rebound could elevate FTM towards the $0.879 resistance mark. Fantom remains a digital asset worth monitoring as it strives for stability and momentum. BlockDAG’s Ambitious Vision: Over 200 Web3 Projects & Worldwide Hackathons BlockDAG is gearing up for an impactful year with grand plans, including a significant partnership with HackerEarth. This alliance will see BlockDAG host four international hackathons, aiming to involve 10,000 to 15,000 developers from HackerEarth’s extensive network of 7.6 million tech experts. These hackathons are designed to foster innovation and develop a diverse global community of developers. BlockDAG’s overarching goal is to catalyze the creation of over 200 Web3 projects within its network, giving developers opportunities to innovate, test, and deploy state-of-the-art decentralized applications (dApps) while demonstrating BlockDAG Network’s distinctive capabilities. With a definitive roadmap and a strong vision for the future, BlockDAG is proving to be an increasingly appealing choice. Analysts estimate that BDAG, with a current price of $0.0248, could potentially escalate to $1 by 2025. Its sophisticated technology, expanding ecosystem, and practical utility are attracting buyers searching for premier opportunities in today’s crypto market. The enthusiasm continues as BlockDAG’s presale has already raised over $182 million and is swiftly progressing towards its $600 million target. As more developers engage and enrich the ecosystem, BlockDAG is solidifying its role as a fundamental player in the Web3 realm. The prospects for both developers and users delving into decentralized options with BlockDAG are looking increasingly promising. Best Altcoins for 2025 While Cardano and Fantom each navigate their distinct challenges and prospects, BlockDAG ascends as the definitive platform for growth and innovation in blockchain. Its lofty ambitions, such as hosting hackathons and expanding its Web3 project ecosystem, underscore its commitment to scalability and utility. Analysts predict that BDAG could reach $1 by 2025, supported by robust presale results and a developer-centric strategy. For those aiming to capitalize on the forthcoming major waves in the crypto world, BlockDAG presents the most compelling proposition, offering both short-term potential and a long-term vision that cements its leadership in the Web3 revolution.

Among the projects driving this revolution, WallitIQ (WLTQ) , Near Protocol (NEAR), and Internet Computer (ICP) have emerged as the top trending coins poised for a legendary climb.

Its unique sharding technology enables easy processing of millions of transactions, making Near Protocol (NEAR) a top contender for decentralized applications. The renowned analyst predicts that Near Protocol (NEAR) will experience a massive surge from its current price of $5.32 as developers flock to its platform. Its user-friendly design, low transaction fees, and eco-friendly consensus mechanism make it a prime choice for Web3 projects.

However, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is drawing more attention with its under $0.5 token poised to jump to $5 upon its launch. WallitIQ (WLTQ): A Game Changer In The World Of DeFi While the recent Shiba Inu price prediction has made headlines, the ongoing WallitIQ (WLTQ) is experiencing a high influx of investors looking to make significant gains given the token’s potential to rise from its under $0.05 presale price to $5 in the shortest period the crypto market has ever seen. The primary objective of WallitIQ (WLTQ) is to promote financial literacy, security, and decentralization among crypto enthusiasts through AI solutions and machine learning algorithms. According to most crypto experts, the increase in demand for efficient and secure wallet solutions positions WallitIQ (WLTQ) for rapid success in the booming billion-dollar crypto wallet and AI market. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) projected $10 million in monthly revenue has attracted both retail and institutional investors looking to secure their spots in the ongoing presale. While investors who joined the presale from the first stage have already secured gains of over 150%, those who chose to join now will also receive several benefits, such as governance participation, premium features, and quick returns due to token price appreciation in the following stage of the presale. In addition to its potential rise from under $0.05 to $5, WallitIQ (WLTQ) provides round-the-clock blockchain activities for its users, which include yield farming, trading of over 2,000 cryptocurrencies, and staking mechanisms that yield significant returns of up to 180% for token holders. Interestingly, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has announced the MVP build of its Crypto Wallet Management Mobile App that offers a wide range of services, including crypto payments for daily purchases like Starbucks coffee or Spotify subscriptions, CoinGecko API integration for real-time crypto price tracking, simulated management of crypto wallets for ETH and USDT, and more. As a platform that prioritizes security in DeFi, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has undergone a thorough smart contract audit conducted by SolidProof , a cybersecurity and blockchain audit firm known for protecting blockchain projects and financial institutions from any cyber attack. To further bolster user confidence, WallitIQ (WLTQ) employs the advanced encryption standard (AES) and elliptic cryptographic curve (ECC) to protect its users’ transactions and private keys from unauthorized devices or individuals. The Potential Shiba Inu Price Surge To $5 The significant increase in the Shiba Inu burn rate signifies the growing interest in its community to reduce its supply, leading analysts to project that it will trigger the Shiba Inu price surge to $0.05. According to a post from X (formerly Twitter) by Shibburn, a total of 44,623,604,014 SHIB were burned in 2024, which further contributed to a yearly increase of 149% in the Shiba Inu price. Trading alongside the broader crypto market, the Shiba Inu price has also gained momentum as Bitcoin retests the $100,000 price mark. The Shiba Inu price has been up 3.8% on the weekly charts, aiming to climb higher amidst the imminent meme frenzy. Data obtained from CoinGecko shows that SHIB has a market of $13.4 billion with a daily trading volume of $730 million. As of the time of this writing, the Shiba Inu price is trading at $0.00002284. Join The WallitIQ (WLTQ) Presale WallitIQ (WLTQ) is currently in the third stage of its presale, with millions of tokens sold and over $6 million raised in just a few months. In anticipation of its official launch, smart investors are rapidly buying the WallitIQ native token (WLTQ) for a low price of $0.0420 each in order to secure substantial gains from its projected rise to $5. Following the growing presale momentum, most crypto experts strongly believe the WallitIQ (WLTQ) would come to an end sooner than expected.

Initially launched in October with a goal of selling only 20 billion WLF tokens, the decentralized finance’s (DeFi) venture token surpassed this target by selling 21 billion tokens, demonstrating robust demand despite a rocky start. Eric Trump Champions World Liberty Financial At ‘High-Profile Event’ Per the report, this surge in interest comes as WLF announces the release of an additional 5 billion tokens from its total supply of 100 billion, citing “massive demand and overwhelming interest.” The Trump family’s foray into the cryptocurrency space has been marked by a blend of enthusiasm and controversy. Over the weekend, both Donald Trump and his wife, Melania, launched their own memecoins, which experienced rapid spikes in value. Related Reading: $24 XRP Prediction: Bitcoin Maxi Calls It Risky But Possible Eric Trump, actively promoting World Liberty Financial, also attended a “high-profile crypto event” in Washington, celebrating the intersection of politics and digital assets as his father prepares for a new administration. Trump’s embrace of the crypto sector during his election campaign has resonated with industry executives, many of whom anticipate a more favorable regulatory environment compared to the policies of the outgoing Biden administration. The appointment of crypto-friendly figures, such as Paul Atkins to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and David Sacks as the newly created artificial intelligence (AI) and Crypto Czar, further underscores this potential shift. However, the venture has not been without its critics. Trump’s Memecoins Spark Controversy Concerns arise over the limited rights associated with WLF tokens, which provide holders with only minimal voting rights and no economic entitlements. Furthermore, the tokens cannot be traded or sold back to WLF, leading to questions about their long-term value and utility. Compounding the intrigue surrounding WLF, notable crypto entrepreneur and TRON blockchain founder Justin Sun recently revealed a significant investment of $45 million into the venture, raising his total stake to $75 million. The market’s reaction has been volatile, exemplified by Bitcoin’s brief spike to a record high of over $109,000 on Monday, followed by a retraction toward $102,000 after Trump’s inauguration speech. Analysts now speculate that upcoming executive orders from Trump could bolster the crypto industry’s fortunes in the US, although skepticism lingers among some industry veterans. Nic Carter, a venture capitalist, articulated concerns about the “ethical implications” of a sitting president engaging in business ventures that could be perceived as “conflicts of interest.” Related Reading: This Analyst Correctly Predicted The Bitcoin Price Crash To $99,000, Here’s What’s Supposed To Happen Next The launch of Trump’s memecoins has also stirred controversy, with the Donald Trump memecoin experiencing a sharp decline from a weekend high of $75 to $52. Meanwhile, the Melania Trump memecoin, which disrupted the market dynamics of the Donald coin, saw its value fluctuate significantly from a high of $13.64 to $8.43. Bernstein analysts have noted that this “chaotic crypto era” marks a critical juncture, suggesting that government engagement with cryptocurrencies may redefine the relationship between leadership and emerging technologies. The analysts assert that the launch of Trump and Melania’s memecoins signifies a potential regulatory shift in the country, where digital assets could serve as a direct connection to a mass audience.

From Just a Chill Guy (CHILLGUY) to Brett (Based), meme coins are proving their staying power in the market, with the potential for massive returns. However, amidst the frenzy of tokens flying off the shelf, one meme coin stands apart: Arctic Pablo ($APC). As it embarks on an epic, mythical journey, Arctic Pablo offers an adventure-filled investment opportunity that promises a long-term ROI that may leave competitors in the dust. But how does Arctic Pablo compare to other top contenders like Just a Chill Guy and Brett? In this article, we’ll take you on an exciting journey to explore these coins, their presale opportunities, and why Arctic Pablo is the best meme coin to buy today for those seeking explosive returns. Let’s investigate the details and discover why Arctic Pablo could be your ticket to massive profit. Arctic Pablo: The Adventurous Meme Coin with Mythical Potential Arctic Pablo is not your average meme coin. Far from the ordinary hype-driven tokens you may be used to, Arctic Pablo ($APC) presents an exciting opportunity at the intersection of myth, reality, and exploration. As Arctic Pablo embarks on his journey through uncharted, mystical lands, he discovers hidden treasures—$APC tokens—that transcend traditional cryptocurrency investments. Currently priced at $0.000026, Arctic Pablo’s presale has already raised over $200,000 in just 12 days, proving that investors are excited about this unique concept. Each presale phase represents a new location, with Pablo traveling from the frosty peaks of the Metropolis to his next destination, Snowy Shores. While other meme coins are content with generic presales, Arctic Pablo creates a sense of adventure and urgency, inviting investors to get in early and stake their claim. What’s the catch? Well, Arctic Pablo’s presale isn’t structured in the usual “stages.” Instead, it’s divided into locations, each representing a new realm of hidden treasures. Metropolis’s current location is already showing off an incredible 30,692% ROI from the 4th stage to the projected listing price of $0.008. As Arctic Pablo’s journey unfolds, early investors are positioned to see explosive returns—so the question is, are you ready to take the ride? If you were to invest $800 in Arctic Pablo at the current presale price of $0.000026, you’d receive a massive $30,718,984.00 APC. When the token hits its launch price of $0.008, your initial investment would balloon to $245,751.872. With numbers like that, it’s easy to see why Arctic Pablo is quickly climbing the ranks of the best meme coins to invest in for short-term gains. Just a Chill Guy: The Cool Cat of Meme Coins Next on our list is Just a Chill Guy (CHILLGUY), a meme coin that brings a laid-back vibe to the crypto scene. Currently priced at $0.07067, CHILLGUY has seen some fluctuations in price, with a recent drop of 16.67%. Despite these ups and downs, CHILLGUY remains a favorite within the Solana and Pump Fun ecosystems, boasting a market cap of around $70.67 million. What makes CHILLGUY stand out? Well, its roots in meme culture and a strong community keep it relevant, even in volatile markets. However, while Just a Chill Guy has made its mark, it doesn’t have the same kind of explosive ROI potential that Arctic Pablo currently offers. At its all-time high of $0.6651, it has since experienced an 89.39% decline, showing that while CHILLGUY may have potential, it doesn’t carry the same level of excitement as Arctic Pablo’s innovative approach. While Just a Chill Guy has a solid fanbase and a market cap that reflects its popularity, Arctic Pablo’s presale model and ongoing journey through unique locations put it on track to outpace meme coins like CHILLGUY in the long run. The potential for ROI with Arctic Pablo far outweighs what CHILLGUY offers, making it one of the best meme coins to buy today. Brett: The Meme Coin on the Rise Let’s now take a look at Brett (Based), another popular meme coin that’s been gaining traction. Priced at $0.09027, Brett has seen a 10.37% decline in the last 24 hours. Despite this, it’s still managed to maintain a market cap of around $889.71 million. With a max supply nearing 10 billion coins and a circulating supply of just under 10 billion, Brett is one of the larger meme coins in terms of market cap. While Brett has certainly shown its potential with a significant rise of 83,764.37% from its all-time low, it has not been able to maintain the same consistent upward momentum that Arctic Pablo boasts. The coin’s recent 61.59% drop from its all-time high of $0.235 reflects some of the volatility that can affect larger meme coins. Still, despite its large supply and strong market cap, Brett (Based) doesn’t provide the kind of innovative opportunity that Arctic Pablo does with its unique presale model and high ROI potential. If you’re looking for the best meme coin to buy today, Brett may seem like a solid investment, but Arctic Pablo’s out-of-the-box approach to presale locations and its jaw-dropping ROI numbers should make it the clear frontrunner. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo stands out as the best meme coin to buy today. Its unique presale model, innovative narrative, and astronomical ROI potential make it a top contender for short-term investments. With over $200,000 already raised, Arctic Pablo’s journey through mystical locations offers investors a thrilling ride that other meme coins like Just a Chill Guy and Brett simply can’t match. The opportunity to buy in early at $0.000026 and watch your investment grow as Arctic Pablo nears its launch price of $0.008 is too good to ignore. With a 66% APY staking program, investors can see their investments grow even further while being part of an exciting adventure that bridges myth and reality. If you want to be part of this exciting journey and maximize your ROI, join the Arctic Pablo presale now and stake your claim in one of the best meme coins to invest in for short-term gains.

Here’s the Timeline,https://timestabloid.com/top-crypto-proponent-calls-100-per-xrp-heres-the-timeline/,"A recent tweet by JackTheRippler, a well-known cryptocurrency commentator, has sparked widespread discussion within the XRP community. The tweet, reading simply, ”$100 per #XRP this year. YES or NO?”, has garnered responses from various enthusiasts on X (formerly Twitter), who shared their perspectives on whether this milestone is achievable for XRP in 2025. The conversation underscores the heightened anticipation surrounding XRP and its potential adoption in cross-border payments and broader financial systems. Two notable replies highlight different perspectives on the feasibility of XRP reaching such a valuation this year. Community Perspectives One respondent, Seek 1st, tied the possibility of a $100 XRP price to the growth of activity on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). They stated, “It all depends on how much traffic there will be on XRPL by year’s end. We know how many potential vehicles will eventually be running but how fast is the adoption?” This comment reflects a common view that XRP’s price growth is contingent upon real-world utility, particularly through increased usage of the XRPL for transactions. Seek 1st further suggested that macroeconomic factors and potential policy changes could play a significant role, mentioning former U.S. President Donald Trump’s potential influence: “We may know a lot more by the end of this month after Trump gives an update.” This highlights how cryptocurrency enthusiasts closely watch broader financial and political developments as potential catalysts for market changes. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Another user, Nicolas Soria, took a more optimistic stance, pointing to the potential for XRP to become the standard for cross-border transactions. Soria wrote , “If implementation of XRP becomes the norm of all cross-border transactions at every major financial institution, then I think it might go higher than that this year.” This comment underscores the transformative potential of XRP’s adoption in the global financial ecosystem, provided institutions continue integrating the asset into their operations. Soria also hinted at rumors of forthcoming executive orders that may benefit the crypto market, writing, “Rumor has it that there are going to be executive orders signed that are very pro-crypto to begin economic recovery.” While these claims remain unverified, they reflect the optimism within the XRP community about regulatory developments favoring the broader adoption of digital assets. The debate sparked by JackTheRippler’s tweet highlights the blend of cautious optimism and bold speculation that defines the XRP community. While many agree that the potential for significant price growth exists, much hinges on real-world adoption, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic factors. As 2025 progresses, these variables will continue to shape XRP’s performance, keeping the community closely engaged in the asset’s journey.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Analyzing 5 cryptos for 2025, led by new contender Rexas Finance. Table of Contents Rexas Finance Nodle Bifrost Shiden Network KILT Protocol Conclusion 2025 is giving bullish sentiment with Donald Trump as the new U.S. president. Investors are looking to position themselves in order to capitalize on this bullish trend, and top analysts have identified some of the coins with the potential to drive riches. Rexas Finance, Nodle, Bifrost, Shiden Network, and KILT Protocol have stood out. Of the five, Rexas Finance is making waves with its transformative approach to real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and its selling out presale. Rexas Finance Rexas Finance has caught the eye of both investors and analysts due to its focus on RWA tokenization. This is a new way of tokenizing physical and digital assets, offering fractional ownership and greater liquidity. RXS is in Stage 11 of its presale, which is currently priced at $0.175, having already raised $36,381,133 out of its $41 million funding target. The presale has been on a lot of people’s radar, with 399 million tokens already bought out of a total of 425 million. Rexas Finance is listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, further boosting confidence. The project also has a Certik audit , showing that it takes its security and transparency seriously. As the presale continues, RXS could soar to incredible price heights in 2025. Nodle Another cryptocurrency that is picking up speed is Nodle, which is worth about $0.00247. Nodle has gotten investors looking for potential growth, witnessing a price increase of almost 8% in the past 24 hours. Analysts believe that Nodle could offer an ROI of about 320%. Therefore, as a decentralized wireless network, it is well-placed to take advantage of the steadily increasing demand. Bifrost Built on Bifrost’s proprietary technology, which aims to bridge different blockchain ecosystems, the token is currently trading at $0.2162, with minor growth of 1.62% over the past week.

Ulbricht created the online black marketplace in 2011, which facilitated the anonymous sale of illegal drugs and illicit goods using Bitcoin as a method of payment. After his arrest in 2013, Ulbricht received a double life sentence plus 40 years without the possibility of parole, which was significantly harsher than many individuals who sold illicit goods on Silk Road or similar platforms. Now, with Ulbricht at age 40, President Trump has issued an unconditional pardon and a statement on Truth Social. “I just called the mother of Ross William Ulbricht to let her know that in honor of her and the Libertarian Movement, which supported me so strongly, it was my pleasure to have just signed a full and unconditional pardon of her son, Ross. The scum that worked to convict him were some of the same lunatics who were involved in the modern day weaponization of government against me. He was given two life sentences, plus 40 years. Ridiculous!” Ulbricht’s mantra for Silk Road centered on principles of personal freedom and individual sovereignty. He touted a marketplace free from government oversight, where people could trade freely as long as no harm was directly caused to others. That philosophy was reflected in Silk Road’s inconsistently enforced and often ignored terms and conditions, which prohibited listings for items explicitly intended to harm others, such as stolen goods, child exploitation material or weapons intended for violence.

Is it the strength of its community, the exciting developments behind it, or the growth potential? If we look at DOGS (DOGS) and PUDGY Penguins (PENGU), it’s clear that these coins are facing some challenges. DOGS has dropped by 22.5% in the past week, while PENGU has seen a 28.8% decline. This has left many investors looking for the next big opportunity. Enter BTFD Coin, which has emerged as a major contender in the meme coin world. The BTFD Coin presale has already made waves, currently in Stage 14, and it’s rapidly catching the attention of savvy investors. With over $5.4 million raised, 65 billion coins sold, and over 8,900 bulls backing it, BTFD Coin is on the rise. This article will explore why BTFD Coin is one of the top new meme coin presales to invest in today , and why now is the perfect time to jump on board. BTFD Coin: The Presale Sensation Ready to Rocket Why is BTFD Coin getting so much attention? It’s not just another meme coin; BTFD Coin is proving to be a powerhouse in the presale market. With its current price of $0.0001600, BTFD Coin offers an incredible entry point for investors. The coin’s presale has already seen massive success, with more than 65 billion coins sold and $5.4 million raised. And as the presale enters Stage 14, investors are looking at significant upside potential. At the moment, BTFD Coin is in a unique position. The project is not only backed by a strong and growing community but also offers staking rewards that can yield up to 90% APY, along with a P2E game that was launched in full on January 1, 2025. The future of BTFD Coin looks bright, and analysts are predicting significant price growth after the coin is listed, which adds further to the excitement. As Stage 14 is here, the demand for BTFD Coin is only expected to rise, especially with the announcement of unsold tokens being burned from Stage 13. To make this opportunity even more appealing, the BTFD Coin presale is offering a 100% bonus with the code LAUNCH100 . This means that for every $BTFD purchased in stage 14, buyers will receive double the tokens—an offer too good to pass up for anyone looking to own the dip.

Dogs: A Vibrant Community But Struggling to Gain Momentum Dogs (DOGS) has a strong community and an interesting project built on the TON Blockchain, but the coin is facing some hurdles. Currently trading at $0.000332, DOGS has experienced a 22.5% drop over the past week, leaving some investors wondering where the price is headed. The project’s reliance on Telegram’s vast user base and its focus on tokenized stickers provides some unique features, but the coin’s recent price movement suggests that it’s struggling to maintain upward momentum. Despite these challenges, the DOGS community remains dedicated, and there’s potential for future growth. Analysts are predicting that DOGS could reach $0.00040 by 2025, which is a positive sign for the future. Pudgy Penguins: Can It Recover from Recent Losses? Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) has established itself as a cultural icon in the meme coin space, with a massive following and millions of views across various platforms. Despite this, the coin is facing a 28.8% decline over the past week, and its trading volume has decreased by 47.6%. Currently priced at $0.02368, PENGU has seen a dramatic fall from its ATH of $0.05738 in December 2024. While Pudgy Penguins remains a well-known project with a strong community, it’s clear that the coin is facing challenges in the current market. As with DOGS, the coin’s performance will depend on its ability to recover and regain investor confidence.

It recently suffered a steep decline, losing over 50% in the past month. However, the RSI indicates it’s not overly oversold. Immediate resistance sits at $0.17, with a major obstacle at $0.23. Breaking these barriers could lead to gains of 30% to 70%. The coin is close to its 10-day moving average, suggesting potential for upward movement if momentum gathers. Yet, with an 81.84% drop over the past six months, caution is advised. The road ahead may be challenging, but if bullish sentiment returns, CHILLGUY could make a surprising comeback. Super Trump (STRUMP): On the Verge of a Potential Surge? Super Trump (STRUMP) might be gearing up for a significant move. Its current price ranges from about $0.00179 to $0.00427, well below recent highs, indicating possible room for growth. The 10-day simple moving average is under the 100-day average, suggesting potential upward momentum. At an RSI of 33.81, the coin appears oversold, hinting at a possible rebound. If it can break the $0.00562 resistance level, it could aim for $0.00809. Despite a decline over the past week and month, this correction phase might set the stage for a powerful upswing. Stay alert for any signs of a bullish trend. Conclusion While ENA, SHIRO, CHILLGUY, and STRUMP may show limited short-term potential, Catzilla stands out as the ultimate meme coin hero aimed at providing financial freedom for all. Offering a 700% ROI in its presale across 14 stages, it combines governance, rewards, and staking.

Trump, 78, announced the decision on Truth Social, sharing that he personally informed Ulbricht’s mother of the news. The president wrote: “I just called the mother of Ross William Ulbricht to let her know that in honor of her and the Libertarian Movement, which supported me so strongly, it was my pleasure to have just signed a full and unconditional pardon of her son, Ross.” Ulbricht had been serving two life sentences plus 40 years without parole at a maximum-security prison in Arizona since 2015. His charges stemmed from running Silk Road, a notorious darknet marketplace that facilitated illegal transactions, mostly paid for in Bitcoin a long time ago. Trump called Ulbricht’s punishment “ridiculous” and blamed “leftist lunatics” for what he described as a politically motivated conviction. Ulbricht’s arrest in San Francisco in October 2013 became a watershed moment in the intersection of cryptocurrency and law enforcement. Using the alias “Dread Pirate Roberts,” Ulbricht launched Silk Road in 2011. The platform allowed users to buy and sell illegal goods, including drugs, using Bitcoin for anonymity. Prosecutors accused him of profiting millions in Bitcoin and charged him with drug trafficking, money laundering, and conspiracy to commit hacking. In 2015, a New York jury found Ulbricht guilty on all counts, leading to one of the harshest sentences ever handed down for such crimes. Despite many appeals, including one to the Supreme Court, Ulbricht remained imprisoned until Trump’s unexpected decision. Trump’s pardon followed a letter from Senator Rand Paul, who urged Trump to act. “I write to urge you to follow through on your stated intention to commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht. Mr. Ulbricht is serving two life sentences plus forty years without parole for nonviolent offenses related to the website he launched in early 2011. Like so many others, I am shocked by the harsh sentence imposed on this first-time offender,” Paul wrote, describing the sentence as “vastly disproportionate” to the crimes. He added that even the most notorious drug dealers using the platform received lighter penalties. Paul’s intervention is believed to have been a key in Trump’s decision to grant the pardon. The self-proclaimed ‘crypto president’ said, “The scum that worked to convict Trump were some of the same lunatics who were involved in the modern day weaponization of government against me. He was given two life sentences, plus 40 years.

39276475,https://timestabloid.com/?p=55191,1737506312,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Top Pundit Feels “Something Huge Is Coming for XRP”,https://timestabloid.com/top-pundit-feels-something-huge-is-coming-for-xrp/,"Edo Farina, CEO of Alpha Lion Academy, recently expressed a strong conviction regarding the future of XRP, stating , “I have a feeling something HUGE is coming for $XRP.” This assertion aligns with a series of significant developments surrounding XRP in recent months, which may substantiate Farina’s optimism. As of January 20, 2025, XRP is trading at $3.08, reflecting a slight decrease of 0.32% from the previous close. The cryptocurrency reached an intraday high of $3.34 and a low of $2.90. Notably, XRP achieved an all-time high of $3.40 recently, surpassing the $3.00 threshold for the first time since 2018. Regulatory Shifts and Market Trends Supporting XRP Several factors have contributed to XRP’s recent upward trajectory. The anticipation of regulatory changes under the new U.S. administration has played a pivotal role. With the inauguration of President Donald Trump, there is speculation about a shift in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) stance towards cryptocurrencies. The nomination of Paul Atkins, known for his pro-crypto views , as the new SEC Chair, suggests a potential easing of regulatory pressures. This development is particularly relevant to Ripple Labs Inc., a company engaged in a legal dispute with the SEC since 2020. The lawsuit alleged that XRP was sold as an unregistered security. However, a federal judge ruled in July 2023 that XRP is not a security when sold to the general public on digital-asset exchanges, though sales to institutional investors were considered unregistered securities transactions. The prospect of a more favorable regulatory environment under the new administration has bolstered investor confidence. Market dynamics have also played a significant role in XRP’s performance. The recent decline in the U.S. core inflation rate has led to expectations that the Federal Reserve might reduce interest rates, creating a more conducive environment for cryptocurrency investments. Furthermore, the introduction of new Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) that hold actual cryptocurrencies, rather than futures, has provided traditional investors with more accessible avenues to invest in digital assets, thereby increasing demand. Institutional Interest Driving XRP Adoption Institutional interest in XRP has seen a notable uptick. WisdomTree, a U.S.-based investment fund manager, launched the WisdomTree Physical XRP ETP on several European exchanges, including Deutsche Börse Xetra, SIX Swiss Exchange, and Euronext in Paris and Amsterdam. This Exchange-Traded Product (ETP), with a management fee of 0.50%, is the most cost-effective ETP in Europe for gaining exposure to XRP. The product is fully backed by XRP and offers dual custody for enhanced security. This move by WisdomTree reflects a growing institutional recognition of XRP’s potential. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Additionally, activist approaches toward crypto investments have emerged. GAM, a Swiss asset manager, has urged Japan’s SBI Holdings to adopt a more proactive strategy regarding its substantial cryptocurrency investments, particularly its significant holdings in Ripple Labs and XRP. GAM’s fund managers have criticized SBI for a lack of transparency and strategic direction concerning its Ripple investments, suggesting measures such as disclosing daily values of XRP holdings and establishing a public XRP coin buyback program. This activist stance underscores the increasing importance of strategic management of crypto assets by institutional investors. Edo Farina’s anticipation of XRP’s significant growth is backed by favorable regulatory prospects, positive market dynamics, and growing institutional interest. These factors collectively contribute to an optimistic outlook for XRP’s future trajectory. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Pepe Loves Bezos (PEPEBEZO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEBEZO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Loves Bezos can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Loves Bezos could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Loves Bezos launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Loves Bezos on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Loves Bezos by entering its contract address – 5fminHHGkusginuqs4jjR2qivagMWWBStM2Hs21HVLcm – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEBEZO. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|DOGE|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-22 00:42:44

The company matched its expansion to the launch of the European Union’s MiCA rules, which lay out clear regulations for crypto businesses. Robinhood Crypto Sets Foot in Spain, Boosting EU Market Presence In a recent announcement on the X platform, Robinhood revealed the launch of its crypto services in Spain as of January 2025. This expansion is part of the company’s strategy to enhance its presence within the EU and the UK’s financial markets. The entry into Spain allows Robinhood to offer its users in the region a variety of services, including crypto trading, staking, and investing. The launch coincides with Robinhood’s efforts to comply with the EU’s MiCA regulations, ensuring a regulated and secure environment for its customers. Last year, Robinhood set the stage for this expansion by introducing crypto transfer capabilities in Europe. This move allowed users to deposit and withdraw over two dozen tokens—a feature highly anticipated by its European user base.’ Co-founder of Robinhood, Vlad Tenev commented, “We remain focused on providing industry-leading products that serve far more of customers’ financial needs, gaining market share, expanding internationally, and continuing to change the industry for the better.” Apart from Robinhood’s EU expansion, another crypto exchange, CryptoCom, has made strides by securing an in-principle MiCA license . This approval allows CryptoCom to operate across all 27 EU member states under the new regulatory framework. Regulatory Challenges and Strategic Adjustments Additionally, recently, the top crypto exchange agreed to a $45 million settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over several regulatory violations. These included failing to maintain and preserve communication records, as well as neglecting to implement adequate measures to prevent identity theft. The SEC also cited insufficient cybersecurity practices as a major concern. The settlement, split between Robinhood Securities and Robinhood Financial, underscores the firm’s commitment to fortifying its operational integrity. More so, the firm’s proactive measures in addressing these challenges are crucial for maintaining trust and reliability among its users. Expanding Reach and Integrating Trending Assets As part of its continued growth strategy, Robinhood has also made a significant addition to its trading platform by listing the TRUMP meme coin on its spot trading market. This new listing, based on the Solana blockchain, diversifies the assets available on the exchange and taps into the growing interest in meme coins. The inclusion of the TRUMP meme coin will enhance user engagement and attract a broader audience. This reflects the crypto exchange ability to adapt to market trends while expanding its service offerings in Spain and across Europe.

""I just called the mother of Ross William Ulbricht to let her know that in honor of her and the Libertarian Movement, which supported me so strongly, it was my pleasure to have just signed a full and unconditional pardon of her son, Ross,"" Trump wrote on a Truth Social post. The move assures an imminent release for Ulbricht, who in 2015 was convicted of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise and distributing narcotics, along with a host of related crimes, via his operation of the darknet Silk Road marketplace. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Ulbricht's case has become a cause célèbre for many in the crypto community who note he did not himself sell drugs or other illegal items but instead operated a platform where others were allowed to transact. Then-candidate Trump promised a ""Day One"" commutation of Ulbricht's sentence last May while addressing the Libertarian Party convention The price of bitcoin (BTC) rose in the minutes following the news, possibly as the pardon, along with a flurry of executive orders over the past hours, signals the president's intention to follow through on campaign promises.

Trader Ali Martinez tells his 116,800 followers on the social media platform X that while retail investors are getting distracted by the recently launched Official Trump ( TRUMP ) memecoin, crypto whales heavily accumulated DOGE to the tune of $640.5 million in just two days. “While everyone focuses on TRUMP, whales bought 1.83 billion Dogecoin DOGE in [48 hours!]” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, DOGE is trading for $0.35. Looking at TRUMP itself, Martinez predicts that the memecoin will surge above $50 if it takes out the diagonal resistance of a falling wedge pattern. A falling wedge structure is often viewed as a bullish reversal pattern as it suggests that selling pressure is losing momentum. “TRUMP seems to be forming a falling wedge on the lower time frames, suggesting a potential consolidation toward the apex before a rebound to $54.” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, TRUMP is worth $32.48. As for the Solana ( SOL )-based meme token dogwifhat ( WIF ), the trader thinks the altcoin is moving inside a large parallel channel – a pattern suggesting that the asset is in a sideways trend as it respects both the support and resistance levels.

According to reports, the Ethereum Foundation has recently moved a substantial amount of Ether. The foundation’s transactions to move and sell its tokens became messier when one of its employees attempted to explain the situation, generating a lot of backlash. Related Reading: $24 XRP Prediction: Bitcoin Maxi Calls It Risky But Possible Ethereum’s recent transactions have occurred since Bitcoin and other top tokens have been ripping through the charts. Price-wise, Ethereum is trading between $3,200 and $3,384, which is too far from 2021’s high of $4,870. What’s Up, Ethereum Foundation? The Ethereum Foundation, the primary organization supporting the development of the blockchain, is not helping the cause. Regardless of its intention or the overriding objectives for unloading massive ETH tranches, these moves still leave a bad taste in the mouths of most holders and supporters. According to a recent post by Spot On Chain on Twitter/X, the foundation has recently moved another 100 ETH in exchange for 336,475 DAI. According to the account, the foundation sold 200 ETH tokens for $67k in the first few days of 2025 at an average cost of $3,361. The account added that ETH is 31% below its 2021 high of $4,878, while Bitcoin continues to retest its highs and currently breached the $109k level.

Stark, a popular ETH supporter, defended the foundation’s decision to sell these ETH tokens, arguing that they’re still actively using the blockchain’s native token. the EF uses Ethereum all the time, for instance to (1) swap ETH for stables (usually @CoWSwap) and (2) to pay people (grantees, team members) in stables and ETH, on mainnet and L2s. Events we run (like Devcon and Devconnect) take onchain payments and use onchain ID for tickets. — Josh Stark (@0xstark) January 20, 2025 In a Twitter/X posting, Stark explained that the foundation uses its tokens every time. These tokens buy stablecoins, pay their people in stablecoins, and support the blockchain’s events. Stark’s comments didn’t sit well with some crypto observers and commentators. Twitter/X user WazzCrypto hit Stark for using ETH “dump” as an explanation to support the foundation’s transactions. User @VelvetMilkman was disappointed with Stark, arguing that it’s a lame excuse for using the altcoins. Meanwhile, X user Trading_Axe has a more scathing, and no holds barred take on the issue: Their brains actually do not work at all. The fuck you need 300K for so urgently? What could you POSSIBLY, as the ETHEREUM FOUNDATION, when the entire world is watching, need 300K OF A PUBLIC SELL ORDER for? Mindless cockroaches.

The increasing number of comments and criticisms against the foundation has caught the attention of Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s co-founder. Buterin said the team has also explored many options, including staking their tokens. However, regulatory issues and potential problems with the hard fork prevented them from doing so. Although there’s a friendly regulatory environment right now, the risks associated with staking remain high.

39278155,https://timestabloid.com/?p=55193,1737509538,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"What is self-exclusion in online gambling, and how does it help players?",https://timestabloid.com/what-is-self-exclusion-in-online-gambling-and-how-does-it-help-players/,"Over 94 million people gamble online regularly every year. Of this number, about 25.6 percent reported having a gambling problem in 2023. This is up 101 percent from 2014, when 12.7 percent of respondents said they were addicted to gambling. As online casino games grow more accessible, so does the risk of problem gambling. Operators like Betway, governments, and regulators have turned to self-exclusion to help problem gamblers remain safe online. Let’s review what it is and how it works. What is self-exclusion? Self-exclusion is a voluntary program in which bettors can request to be banned from online gambling platforms for a given period. Many regulators and operators, like the betway casino , offer self-exclusion services to help online gamblers address and resolve problem gambling tendencies. By self-excluding from gambling platforms, you limit your exposure to gambling and reduce the harm of addiction. Self-exclusion often works in tandem with other problem gambling solutions, including: Therapy and counseling Support groups Budgetary restrictions If successful, self-exclusion can limit your risk of the impacts of addiction gambling, including emotional distress, personal relationship strains, and financial loss. Within the igaming industry, offering self-exclusion options is also a mark of a reliable operator who understands gambling risks and is willing to help you manage them. How do I self-exclude from online gambling? You can self-exclude from online gambling through an online betting website or app with self-exclusion options. Most operators opt into a regional or national exclusion scheme like Gamstop and offer self-exclusion as part of their responsible gambling package. When you self-exclude through one platform, you effectively self-exclude from all platforms registered with the scheme. You can self-exclude from online gambling temporarily or permanently, from as little as 24 hours to several months or longer. Can I access an online casino after self-excluding? Not until your exclusion period expires. When you apply for self-exclusion, the website verifies your identity and records your data, including your account details, address, and name. Once you’re locked out of your account, you cannot use these details to log back in or create a new account before the end of the exclusion period. You may also be barred from receiving gambling-related ads. Can I exclude from multiple online casinos at once? Yes. Some regions and countries have multi-operator self-exclusion schemes that allow you to self-exclude from all registered operators at once. When you self-exclude in such a region, you enter a centralized list that all operators on the scheme use to limit access to gambling services. Is self-exclusion foolproof? No. In addition to being only one part of the solution, self-exclusion is difficult to implement in the digital era. It relies primarily on your ability to recognize that you have a gambling problem and your willingness to seek help. Not all bettors have that. Even after you’ve self-excluded, you can access gambling services if you want to. Some bettors use VPNs or create accounts on non-scheme platforms. Responsible gambling in 2025 Online gambling platforms have gotten a lot better at preventing self-excluded bettors from accessing gambling services. Operators like Betway track cookies, account creation patterns, player profiles, and IP addresses to enforce and maintain self-exclusion statuses. In 2025, as regulators refocus on responsible gaming, these efforts should receive more regional, national, and international support from regulatory frameworks and policies.

Despite its commitment to decentralization, it operates as a centralized entity, with a director, a treasury, paid developers, and an inner circle. These structures, while necessary for coordination, create tensions with Ethereum's decentralized ethos. The Foundation Today It is not widely known, but the current foundation was constructed in a less than ideal way. The previous director, Ming, was ousted in a coordinated effort by a group of people who have never been publicly identified or held accountable for it. I spoke with Ming days before her removal and she assured me she had no intent of leaving. I was later given information about who was responsible for her removal, but was not given much insight as to why. I have heard that Ming was a bit of a micromanager, and that she had an intensity that rubbed some people the wrong way. I’m sure there’s truth to that, but these stories are often window dressing for deeper truths. I can infer some good-faith reasons based on the way the org has been run over the past seven years. A very important role of the organization is to protect against internal power struggles as well as external capture. These are noble goals and ones they seem to have accomplished effectively. Another major focus seems to have been minimizing the public footprint of the organization and constructing it in such a way that it would not draw the ire of governments who might hold them accountable if the political winds shifted against them. But as political winds shift, and the marketplace provides alternatives, the organization itself must adapt, both in form and function.Ethereum was in its birth a visionary project, not simply technological in nature. It pointed towards a possibility of previously unimaginable futures through the empowerment of the individual to do what had previously taken billions of dollars, thousands of people, or millions of man hours to accomplish. The Ethereum Foundation, in its current incarnation, designed to minimize threats both internal and external, has lost that vision. Lead with Vision Ethereum’s next phase demands more than just technical research and coordinating conferences. It requires visionary leadership — someone who understands not just the technology but its broader social, philosophical, and political implications. This leader must inspire a new generation of builders, connect technology with human needs, and navigate the complexities of the political landscape without compromising Ethereum’s ethos.Read more: Sam Kessler - Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin Goes On Offense Amid Major Leadership Shake-up The Ethereum whitepaper was not just a technical document; it was a beacon that allowed like-minded people to come together under a shared vision. In the face of chaos, uncertainty, and frequent conflicts, it served as a guiding light. What ensured our collective success was not the absence of challenges but the clarity of the mountaintop we were striving toward. This common vision allowed us to stay aligned even when disagreements and setbacks arose. It was an idea whose time had come—a blueprint that transcended the individuals behind it and inspired a community to persevere, innovate, and ultimately bring that vision to life. Without it, the project could have easily unraveled under the weight of its ambition. Be Transparent, Focus More on the Community Transparency is equally critical. Over the past few years, the Foundation has retreated into the shadows, leaving the community feeling disconnected. But ethereum would have been nothing without its community, and it will be nothing if it loses it. A community must be managed, curated, and cared for. It requires the onboarding of new people, with new energy, and new ideas, bound by a common vision. This also includes the teams who build on ethereum. Seize the Moment From a legal perspective, Ethereum must embrace the opportunity to engage with lawmakers. The current American political climate is uniquely favorable, and inaction now risks losing momentum. America has elected a President who not only owns ether, but has himself launched a lending protocol on top of it. As of now, we are inhabiting a political landscape which was unthinkable even a year ago, when Democrats surprised so many of us by openly declaring war on crypto, and the future seemed uncertain. There has never been a better time than now to ensure that the promise of crypto is realized. While maintaining political neutrality, the Foundation can create or promote frameworks that encourage compliance and innovation. Without these frameworks, the crypto space has been plagued by speculative ventures—ICOs, DAOs, NFTs—that skirt regulations rather than working within them to build sustainable use cases. Lead by Example The Ethereum Foundation should also consider utilizing its own technology to coordinate its operations and demonstrate the transformative potential of decentralized systems. By adopting Ethereum-based tools and protocols, the Foundation could potentially manage governance, treasury disbursements, decision-making processes, and community engagement. This approach would not only demonstrate Ethereum’s capabilities but also reinforce trust within the community by embodying the principles of decentralization and transparency that the project champions. Additionally, leveraging Ethereum’s ecosystem for coordination could serve as a real-world case study, inspiring developers and organizations to explore similar solutions. By integrating its technology into its own operations, the Foundation would highlight the real-world utility of the platform while setting a precedent for how decentralized systems can effectively manage complex organizations. Be Accountable, Build the Future Finally, financial accountability must become a priority. With $100 million spent annually, the Foundation should deliver measurable outcomes. Despite significant investment in technical research, user experience in crypto remains stagnant. Improving UX, UI, key management, and other security and usability problems isn’t insurmountable but has been severely neglected. This oversight reflects a blind spot which must be addressed before wider adoption is possible. Ethereum began as more than just a technological project—it was a visionary movement for empowering individuals to achieve what once required massive resources. That vision is at risk of being lost. To reignite it, the Foundation must embrace transparency, invest in leadership, engage the community, and step into the legal and political spotlight. Ethereum’s story is one of triumph over chaos, and a testament to the power of collective vision. To ensure its future, the Ethereum Foundation must transform itself from a reactive institution into a proactive visionary force. For ethereum. For the community. For the greater good. For the future.

The cost-per-acquisition (CPA) model facilitates earning commissions whenever a person performs a specific action, such as making a deposit. In this guide, we will explore the importance of CPA and demonstrate the benefits of becoming an affiliated partner of reliable providers like P4P Partners. What Is CPA in Affiliate Marketing? CPA refers to the commission model that enables affiliates to earn a fee for motivating players to join iGaming platforms and perform specific actions. In the online gambling industry, CPA casino affiliate programs have gained prominence due to their effectiveness in driving high-quality traffic. Understanding the commission structure associated with this type of marketing is crucial for improving the quality of promotional efforts. Affiliates typically earn a fixed amount for every player who joins a platform or app. Maximizing earnings rests upon their ability to bring high-paying customers. The size of the commissions depends on the company they cooperate with and the deposit amount. Why Choose the CPA Model in Casino Marketing? Affiliates prefer to utilize the CPA model due to its transparent payout terms. By adjusting their promotional strategies, they can find a way to increase their payouts. Driving new traffic and motivating players to maintain regular activity on a platform enables affiliates to boost their revenues. Let’s consider the key upsides to joining gambling affiliate programs: Growing earnings; An easy-to-understand multi-payment system; Clear criteria for becoming an affiliate; Predictable income; Immediate payouts; Reduced risk. The CPA model is perfectly suitable for affiliates interested in quick earnings. This approach allows them to earn 100-500 EUR per every registration and subsequent deposit. However, choosing a reliable company is necessary to earn high commissions and promote top-quality products. CPA vs. RevShare Casino Affiliate Marketing Programs Even though the CPA commission model deservedly remains popular, some people still opt for the RevShare (Revenue Share) model, as the latter allows them to earn a percentage of revenue generated by site visitors. While one-time commissions for bringing one client seem high, top-quality leads may help marketers maximize their returns if they choose the RevShare model. Before making the final decision, it’s worth comparing casino CPA and RevShare programs to select the best option. While the former enables marketers to enjoy consistent earnings, the latter may be less profitable, as commissions often change due to player preferences. CPA programs are preferred by those who prioritize bringing in new customers and do not want to depend on the level of player engagement. Choosing between CPA and RevShare models requires affiliates to analyze their favorite marketing approaches, financial goals, and willingness to deal with volatility. How to Join a CPA Casino Affiliate Program? Marketers should opt for trusted iGaming affiliate networks with many satisfied clients when looking for new income sources. Such businesses establish partnerships with well-known brands that release trendy games with enticing bonuses and incentives. Providers like P4P Partners are renowned in the industry for their spotless reputation. They offer a choice of opportunities to earn money. Follow these steps to become an affiliate: Sign up with a chosen service provider; Fill out an online form; Share links with your followers via social media and websites. With affiliate earnings reaching 250,000 EUR per month, the CPA model becomes more popular. Trusted services offer up to 50% of each first deposit to those who bring in paying customers. Becoming an affiliate is a life-changing decision that allows marketers to stabilize their financial situation and master new user acquisition skills. Famous brands like P4P Partners offer multiple payout options and have flexible conditions catering to the needs of their affiliates.

More on Chainlink Price Prediction & Injective Upgrade,https://thecoinrise.com/web3bay-leads-the-pack-as-2025s-high-roi-altcoin-more-on-chainlink-price-prediction-injective-upgrade/,"2025 might be pivotal for high-return altcoins. With Chainlink’s upbeat price forecast backed by its new Cross-Chain Token standard boosting interoperability, it’s primed for wider use. Injective’s update enhances its service by incorporating tokenized AI resources, broadening ETP options, and underlining its innovation and user reach. Both projects are gaining traction by merging advanced technology with practical uses. Enter Web3Bay, a revolutionary in decentralized e-commerce. More than a marketplace, it allows token holders to earn passively and tap into the thriving Web3 domain. Offering future staking rewards, unique loyalty benefits, and seamless Web3 integration, Web3Bay represents a significant growth avenue in blockchain commerce, an appealing choice for those eyeing expansion. Web3Bay: Pioneering Decentralized Marketplaces for Enhanced Earnings Web3Bay is changing the e-commerce landscape by launching a blockchain-based decentralized marketplace. It not only supports transactions but also gives token holders chances to earn passively and engage with the Web3 environment. An upcoming feature is staking rewards that encourage further earnings and motivate long-term token holding. Web3Bay’s current presale is in stage four, with the 3BAY token priced at $0.004562. Following a tiered price increase of 15% per stage, it’s expected to hit $0.1959 by the final phase. With over $830,000 collected, early buyers can reap a potential ROI of up to 6,430% from the initial price of $0.003. The platform also provides exclusive marketplace discounts and benefits to token holders. Additionally, Web3Bay plans to expand into NFTs and DeFi, maintaining its relevance in the expanding Web3 domain. This mix of innovative offerings and a strong presale model positions Web3Bay as a top choice for immediate and long-term blockchain market value. Chainlink Price Prediction: Anticipating Significant Growth Chainlink’s latest updates, especially the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) v1.5, are enhancing its functionality. This upgrade introduces a Cross-Chain Token (CCT) standard, simplifying the creation and management of tokens across various blockchains. This adoption is driving a positive outlook for Chainlink, with price expectations reaching up to $29 and possibly $40 if the bullish trend persists. Supporting this growth are substantial investments from institutions, with over $31 million in LINK tokens purchased since mid-January 2025, indicating strong confidence in its capabilities and future. This institutional and technical support reinforces Chainlink’s strong market position, offering promising opportunities in blockchain solutions with practical applications. Injective Upgrade: Expanding Capabilities and Accessibility The recent Injective upgrade emphasizes its commitment to broadening functionality and accessibility. Through a partnership with Aethir, Injective has incorporated tokenized GPU compute resources, enabling AI agents to work smoothly across blockchains like Solana. This development places Injective at the core of blockchain and AI integration—a sector with substantial growth prospects. Further establishing its market presence, Injective has launched new ETPs (Exchange-Traded Products) with 21Shares and Valour Funds. These products simplify access to INJ tokens and offer staking rewards, boosting holder engagement and utility. This upgrade and these new offerings underline Injective’s focus on user-centric growth and technological advancement. Key Takeaway! The advancements at Chainlink, especially the new Cross-Chain Token standard, alongside the upbeat Chainlink price forecast, hint at a strong year for LINK. Similarly, Injective’s latest update with tokenized AI resources and new ETP launches highlights its dedication to innovation and user-focused growth. Amid these updates, Web3Bay emerges as a standout in blockchain commerce. With its combination of staking rewards, loyalty benefits, and Web3 integrations, it merges e-commerce utility with real-world token benefits. For those seeking durable value in blockchain ventures, Web3Bay offers a chance to join a progressive ecosystem that melds earning potential with groundbreaking features. These initiatives underscore how blockchain continues to evolve decentralized solutions for a dynamically expanding digital economy.

39278450,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=680038,1737511218,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/39278450.jpeg,"Ethereum Appears ‘Bottomed Out,’ Analyst Predicts A Rally Is Near",https://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/ethereum-appears-bottomed-out-analyst-predicts-a-rally-is-near/,"Ethereum (ETH) appears to have ‘bottomed out,’ according to crypto analyst Mister Crypto. The analyst shared this observation as investor confidence in ETH continues to wane due to the digital asset’s relatively lackluster price performance in 2024. Is Ethereum Due For A Rally? Unlike Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL), which have surged in the past year by 146% and 154%, respectively, Ethereum has risen a modest 32% over the same period. As a result, ETH holders are understandably frustrated with the digital asset’s price action, with some whales liquidating their holdings at losses of up to $1 million. Related Reading: Will Ethereum Bounce Back? Crypto Analysts Discuss Potential Price Recovery However, some analysts now believe it may finally be time for Ethereum to break out of its stagnation. Crypto trader Mister Crypto shared the following ETH/BTC monthly chart on X, showing ETH’s price bouncing off a long-standing trendline before entering a parabolic run. This analysis aligns with a recent report highlighting ETH’s four-year low of 0.031 against BTC on the weekly chart. A potential rebound from this multi-year support level could position ETH to outperform BTC in the short term. Crypto analyst Merlijn The Trader also identified a bullish falling wedge pattern forming on Ethereum’s 2-day chart. According to Merlijn, a breakout to the upside could make Ethereum’s next move “legendary.” For the uninitiated, a bullish falling wedge is a technical chart pattern that forms when an asset’s price consolidates between two downward-sloping, converging trendlines. It typically signals a potential trend reversal or continuation, with a breakout to the upside expected once the price moves above the upper trendline. In Ethereum’s case, its price must decisively break through the $3,400 level to confirm the bullish falling wedge pattern. Failure to do so could result in ETH falling to the next major support levels at $3,000 and potentially $2,400. Finally, seasoned crypto market commentator Poseidon offered a more macro perspective on ETH’s price action. The analyst noted that Ethereum has been trading within a range for the past four years. A breakout above the critical $4,000 resistance level could propel ETH beyond $10,000, based on Fibonacci price extensions. 2025: The Year Of Altseason? A full-blown altseason typically requires ETH to lead the market. Thus, a strong 2025 for Ethereum could significantly increase the likelihood of the eagerly anticipated altseason. Fortunately, many investors are optimistic about ETH’s prospects this year. Related Reading: Ethereum Poised For A Bullish Q1 2025? Here’s What Experts Say In December 2024, analysts at brokerage firm Bernstein remarked that ETH’s risk-reward ratio has become increasingly attractive. Similarly, Steno Research predicted that ETH could outperform BTC in Q1 2025, with a price target as high as $8,000. However, the $4,000 resistance level remains ETH’s Achilles’ heel. At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $3,280, down 2.1% in the past 24 hours.

Their latest analysis shows that the Dogecoin price would drop by 59% in the coming weeks. On the other hand, they have identified WallitIQ, an AI altcoin, as the potential “Shiba Inu (SHIB) of this cycle,” having shown a similar historical pattern. The crypto community’s reaction to this prediction has raised an important question for investors: Why are memecoin whales jumping ship to WallitIQ (WLTQ) ? WallitIQ (WLTQ) Shows Promising Signs As The Next 50,000% Crypto Success Story According to Bloomberg Analysts, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has dubbed itself as the Shiba Inu (SHIB) of this cycle. The AI altcoin has flashed numerous bullish signals for a 50,000% surge by June. This once-in-a-lifetime opportunity has stirred short-term and long-term investors who want to become millionaires to join the lucrative platform. Further analysis shows that only early adopters will enjoy maximum rewards. There are several reasons WallitIQ (WLTQ) is the talk of the crypto community. From creating a highly-rewarding ecosystem to the launch of the MVP build of its Crypto Wallet Management Mobile App , WallitIQ (WLTQ) has outperformed other presale companions and established crypto projects. The affordable $0.0420 AI altcoin will spike to $21 before June. As such, whales and seasoned crypto enthusiasts are pitching their tents to secure their position before the price changes. Hence, Bloomberg analysts think WallitIQ (WLTQ) will surpass a $20 million inflow before June. The AI altcoin provides unrestricted access to sophisticated technology and numerous trading opportunities. Its all-in-one app displays transaction histories, observes real-time prices via the CoinGecko API, and manages their wallets. Its AI-powered trading automation is underway for investors who want to gain insights into exclusive data like Bloomberg analysts. Another outstanding feature of the AI altcoin is its access to over 1,000 cryptocurrencies. Beginners can employ the artificial intelligence (AI) protocol to determine a worthy investment, while long-term investors can multiply their rewards by a possible 180% APY when they stake their tokens. As the hype about the Dogecoin price plummets, WallitIQ (WLTQ) shows more promising signs as the next 50,000% crypto success story. Investors do not need to worry about the safety of their assets as WallitIQ (WLTQ) has fulfilled a smart contract audit from SolidProof. Hence, no one wants to miss the golden chance to get in and enjoy substantial profits. With only $0.0420, you can create the path to generational wealth. Several early adopters have become millionaires. With bigger rewards on the horizon, now is the right time to lock in. Buy WLTQ tokens today. Dogecoin Price Prediction: DOGE Whales Seek Another After A Possible 59% Drop The Dogecoin price has struggled in 2025 despite a strong end to 2024. In the past day, the Dogecoin price has dropped by 4.92%. As of this writing, the Dogecoin price trades below $0.4. However, Bloomberg analysts have identified this level as the beginning of a 59% drop while highlighting an AI altcoin, WallitIQ (WLTQ), as a worthy investment. The crypto community has reacted to this prediction as more whale networks have abandoned Dogecoin (DOGE) for WallitIQ (WLTQ). Can Shiba Inu (SHIB) Repeat History? Shiba Inu (SHIB) experienced a great run in October 2021. Within 2 weeks, Shiba Inu (SHIB) grew by 1163%. Bloomberg analysts said WallitIQ (WLTQ) showed a bullish pattern similar to that of Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) historical pattern. The rise of Shiba Inu (SHIB) was fostered by strong media hyper and community engagement. However, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has shown better potential.. Conclusion While the Dogecoin price faces a predicted 59% decline, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has emerged as a potential “Shiba Inu (SHIB) of this cycle.” Bloomberg analysts have spelled out the contrasting fortunes of Dogecoin (DOGE) and WallitIQ (WLTQ). This shows that the market dynamics have shifted from meme-coin, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), to this AI altcoin, which has cemented its position as the best presale event in crypto history. The movement of DOGE whales towards the AI altcoin shows a strategic positioning for massive growth potential. The ever-changing crypto landscape has a new star in WallitIQ (WLTQ) and its incoming uptrends. Buy the WLTQ tokens today to ride the next bull wave in the coming weeks.

Concurrently, Aave is seeing a notable increase in value following its V4 upgrade and strategic rebranding, drawing substantial interest from the DeFi community. Amidst this, BlockDAG (BDAG) is emerging as a pivotal player. With plans to list on 10 major CEXs, it is poised to make significant strides in market visibility, liquidity, and global reach. The momentum building around BDAG is palpable, raising the question of not if, but when to engage with BlockDAG as it prepares to redefine the norms of blockchain scalability. BlockDAG: On the Verge of a Major Breakthrough—Are You Positioned? BlockDAG is at a critical juncture, ready to launch on 10 key centralized exchanges (CEXs) in what is one of the most eagerly awaited events in the crypto sphere this year. This move is anticipated to significantly enhance BDAG’s market presence and adoption. For those looking ahead, now presents a strategic opportunity to get involved before BlockDAG escalates to a global scale and reaches its full potential. Having already raised $182.5 million in its presale, with 17.9 billion BDAG coins distributed, BlockDAG is capturing intense market interest. At a current presale price of $0.0248 per BDAG, early adopters are looking at a 2380% ROI, reaffirming BlockDAG’s position as one of the top bullish cryptos to buy now. With its sophisticated Phantom and GhostDAG protocols, BlockDAG offers unmatched scalability and throughput, setting it apart in the Web3 landscape. Its recent partnership with HackerEarth, which aims to engage over 15,000 developers to kickstart more than 200 projects, is likely to fortify its ecosystem further. As the presale period draws to a close and the CEX launch approaches, BlockDAG is distinguishing itself as a formidable contender in the 2025 crypto market. Virtuals Protocol: Pioneering the Next Generation of AI Agents Virtuals Protocol is elevating AI agents by enabling their tokenized ownership and monetization across various digital landscapes. In January 2025, its token reached a new peak of $4, fueled by robust adoption and demand, and it currently trades at $3.62, maintaining strong market presence. Now housing over 2,200 AI agents, with top valuations surpassing $300 million, Virtuals has bolstered its platform security, enhancing user confidence. With ambitious plans for expansion and new AI-driven tools in development, Virtuals Protocol is positioning itself as an innovative leader in blockchain technology applications, promising a bright future in the upcoming year. Aave’s Price Surge: Unpacking the DeFi Enthusiasm Aave remains a focal point in the decentralized finance arena with its latest V4 protocol enhancement, incorporating features like an emergency redemption mechanism for its GHO stablecoin to mitigate depegging risks. This initiative underscores Aave’s commitment to addressing key DeFi sector challenges. With these enhancements set for completion by mid-2025, there’s already a noticeable impact on Aave’s valuation. Furthermore, Aave’s transition to Avara and the acquisition of the crypto wallet Family have broadened its Web3 footprint. These strategic moves are not only expanding its user base but are also contributing to a surge in Aave’s market price. As Aave continues to refine its operations on platforms like Polygon, it is adopting a proactive stance in ensuring secure and scalable growth through 2025. Summing Up! Aave is reinforcing its stronghold in DeFi through its innovative V4 upgrade and strategic transition to Avara, which is mirrored in the appreciating Aave price. Likewise, Virtuals Protocol’s significant role in the decentralized application sphere, especially with its AI agents, is becoming increasingly central, highlighted by its token’s current performance. As these initiatives gain momentum, BlockDAG is poised for a landmark market entry with its upcoming debut on 10 centralized exchanges. This development is set to dramatically elevate BDAG’s liquidity and market demand, affirming its status as one of the best bullish cryptos to buy now . As BlockDAG prepares for this pivotal event, the strategic window for engagement is now.

However, he admitted he didn’t know much about its performance. While speaking to a group of reporters on Tuesday afternoon, Trump was asked about his new meme coin. He said: I don’t know much about it other than I launched it. I heard it was very successful. I haven’t checked. President Donald Trump After the comments, TRUMP fell over 30% to $34.88 but has since recovered and is now trading at $42.07 . Trump’s meme coin surges to $15B before MELANIA’s launch Trump Organization affiliate CIC Digital LLC launched the ‘TRUMP’ meme coin . The firm is linked to previous sales of crypto collectible NFTs launched in 2022 that made millions of dollars but have since fallen dramatically in value for their owners. The Solana-based meme coin was launched three days before Trump took office. The meme coin’s market cap jumped to $15 billion over the weekend, although it currently trades with a market cap around $8 billion. The coin surged from less than $10 on Saturday morning to as high as $74.59 before giving up some of its gains on Monday. One of the reporters at the Tuesday meeting mentioned that the TRUMP token had generated several billion dollars in the past few days. The president appeared shocked and responded, “Several billion?” He then dismissed the gains as insignificant. He pointed out that SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son, OpenAI’s Sam Altman, and Oracle’s Larry Ellison, who were present in the room, were worth much more. The TRUMP token dropped 50% Sunday afternoon following the news that Trump’s wife, First Lady Melania Trump, had also launched her own meme coin. Both tokens are believed to be largely owned by Trump insiders. Thanks to their high profile and social media presence, the TRUMP coin and MELANIA coin have already entered the top 100 coins in terms of value. MELANIA’s coin is now worth more than AI entrepreneur Sam Altman’s Worldcoin. Trump signs executive orders, issues pardons, and plans cryptocurrency policies On his first day in office, Trump signed multiple executive orders on energy, border security, immigration, infrastructure, and more. He pardoned Ross Ulbricht of Silk Road and 1,500 January 6 protesters, including Oath Keepers and Proud Boys. However, he did not address a promised Bitcoin strategic reserve or reverse the prior administration’s policies, which some have dubbed Operation Chokepoint 2.0. Trump is reportedly planning to issue an executive order making cryptocurrency a national policy priority and has appointed David Sacks as his administration’s crypto czar. Several exchanges and brokerages, including Coinbase and Robinhood, have listed the “official” TRUMP meme coin.

Inaugurated Trump (TRUMPINA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 12,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPINA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Inaugurated Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Inaugurated Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Inaugurated Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Inaugurated Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Inaugurated Trump by entering its contract address – 2F9Q7eZwdnfWUY6Pcqvb7KFDXVW2vcoLCDoTkzsHUvTF – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPINA.

For investors, 2025 is shaping up to be no different, with both emerging projects and established giants vying for attention. The key is figuring out which coins can deliver exponential returns and which might fall short. Qubetics is one of the rising stars of 2025, turning heads with its innovative approach as the world’s first Web3 aggregator. If you’re hunting for the best cryptos for exponential returns, Qubetics has all the markings of a market leader. Not to be outdone, Tron and Render are also making headlines. Both projects have secured their places in the crypto ecosystem, serving as reliable investments for different kinds of investors. Let’s explore what makes these three cryptos the top picks for January 2025. Qubetics: The Best Cryptos for Exponential Returns Qubetics is redefining the crypto space with its role as a Web3 aggregator . It’s a unifying platform that connects decentralized apps, users, and data across multiple blockchains. By solving one of blockchain’s biggest challenges—Qubetics has positioned itself as a game-changer for businesses, developers, and everyday users. One of Qubetics’ standout features is its ability to simplify cross-border transactions . Imagine you’re a small business owner in South America wanting to pay a supplier in Europe. Traditionally, you’d face long delays, high fees, and complex banking systems. With Qubetics, those payments happen almost instantly and at a fraction of the cost. Freelancers can also use Qubetics to manage contracts and payments globally without worrying about currency conversions or hidden fees. For developers, Qubetics’ seamless integrations mean they can build dApps that function effortlessly across Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon without worrying about compatibility issues.

With a token price of $0.0551, the project’s raised over $10.1 million, cementing its status as a must-watch crypto. The numbers tell the story. Analysts predict $TICS will hit $0.25 by the end of the best crypto presale , a 353.39% increase. Long-term projections include $1, $5, and even $15 after the mainnet launch, marking potential returns as high as 27,103.64%. For anyone looking for the best cryptos for exponential returns, Qubetics is a no-brainer. Tron: A DeFi Powerhouse Tron has built its reputation as a decentralized platform for content sharing and smart contracts. With its lightning-fast transactions and low fees, Tron has carved out a niche in the DeFi and gaming industries. Its native token, TRX, is a staple among crypto enthusiasts seeking both utility and investment potential. As of January 21, 2025, Tron’s price stands at $0.23988, with a slight dip of 0.00053% from the previous close. Beyond the numbers, Tron’s strategic partnership with Wintermute has been a game-changer. This collaboration enhances liquidity and OTC trading for TRX and other tokens within the Tron ecosystem, strengthening its DeFi presence. Adding to the intrigue, reports suggest that former U.S. President Donald Trump invested $4.7 million in TRX on his first day in office. While unconfirmed, such news adds a layer of excitement and speculation to Tron’s market dynamics. Tron’s ability to deliver scalable, low-cost solutions makes it a favorite for developers and investors alike. Whether you’re looking to trade, stake, or develop, Tron offers robust infrastructure to meet your needs. It remains a strong contender for investors seeking reliable growth.

This approach has drastically reduced costs and increased accessibility for industries like gaming, animation, and virtual reality. R ender’s price as of January 21, 2025, is $6.64, reflecting a 7.65% dip from the previous close. Despite the short-term decline, Render continues to innovate.

The announcement came through Trump’s social media platform, Truth Social, where he stated it was his “pleasure” to grant clemency to Ulbricht, who had been serving a life sentence since 2015. Ulbricht, 40, was convicted for his role in creating and running Silk Road, a dark web marketplace used for the sale of illegal drugs and other items. The pardon fulfills a promise Trump made during his presidential campaign, which gained widespread attention among libertarian activists and criminal justice reform advocates. Donald Trump Justifies Ross Ulbricht Clemency Decision President Donald Trump has stated his displeasure with the legal process that resulted in Ulbricht receiving a life sentence. In a post on the Truth Social platform, he called the sentence “ridiculous” and lambasted the actors in the case as “the same freaks” who, he alleged, conspired against him during his time in the White House. Trump said he had talked to Ulbricht’s mother during his first full day back in the White House and informed her that he would be pardoning her son. ”Ross has done enough time in jail for non-violent crimes,” said Trump. Amid this pardon, bullish momentum has resurfaced with TRUMP memecoin recovering and price soaring to $42.03, a 20% surge from the intra-day low of $32. The pardon has elicited cheers and jeers as Ulbricht’s case has been a subject of division for quite some time. Some of the people defending him say that the punishment he received was severe while others claim that the platform was used to coordinate large-scale drug distribution. However, despite the pardon, Ross Ulbricht (ROSS) token price dipped over 51% to trade at $0.01091, as of press time. Libertarian Support and Calls for Clemency The Libertarian Party has been advocating for getting leniency for Ulbricht. Chair of the Libertarian National Committee Angela McArdle said he is a “political prisoner” and praised the decision to pardon as a victory for their cause. “Ross Ulbricht has been a libertarian political prisoner for over ten years,” McArdle said in a statement. She also thanked Donald Trump for taking action, saying it was ‘a long-overdue step toward justice.’ Senator Rand Paul, who had encouraged Trump to intervene, also voiced support for a clemency for Ulbricht. Paul said that Ulbricht received a harsh sentence than the drug dealers who used the Silk Road. He pointed to several cases of car dealers getting from five to ten years behind the bars, while Ulbricht was given two life terms without a chance for parole. Ulbricht’s Time in Prison and Path to Clemency Ulbricht has spent more than 11 years in federal prison and has not violated any prison rules while serving time. According to media, he has not only spent his time in prison teaching math and science but also practicing yoga. His defense and friends have also called attention to the inconsistencies in the case such as charges for murder for hire that were dropped. His clemency lawyer Brandon Sample thanked Trump for fulfilling the promise made during his campaign saying that the decision has bought ‘relief and hope’ to Ulbricht’s family. Ulbricht’s case had not remained confined to the libertarian community only. Supporters of criminal justice reform said his punishment exemplifies what they believe is excessive punishment for non-violent crimes. Broader Context of Donald Trump’s Pardons The pardon for Ulbricht is within a list of many executive orders that Donald Trump has signed since he began his second term in office. On Monday, Trump commuted the sentences of approximately 1,500 people who have been charged in relation to the January 6 Capitol attack sparking controversies. The pardon also had support from Tesla CEO Elon Musk , a supporter of the Trump administration. He announced the decision on social media where he said, “Ross will be freed too.” Ulbricht, who founded Silk Road under the alias of Dread Pirate Roberts, was arrested in 2013 and found guilty in 2015. He was the first to offer his platform as a marketplace for purchasing goods and services using Bitcoin on the dark web.

The tweet reads, “About 98% of the people will sell their #XRP after $10-$50. I am here to see the price above $100. Who will stay with me?” The statement resonated with community members, who shared their perspectives on holding strategies and price targets. The responses highlight a significant divide in the community, ranging from conservative profit-taking approaches to ambitious long-term holding plans. Community Perspectives on Price Targets One user, Magixchirps, shared an especially bold outlook stating , “I’m here to see it past $1000 and still wouldn’t sell at that price. I have 15 years left before I reach the retirement age of a reg hard working man. So I will let it sit until I reach that number.” This comment underscores a belief in XRP’s potential to reach unprecedented price levels and a long-term investment mindset tied to personal financial goals. Magixchirps reflects a segment of investors who see XRP as a cornerstone of their retirement strategy, regardless of shorter-term price fluctuations. Another user, SunsetButterfly, offered a slightly more conservative but still optimistic perspective, she said “Above a $100 yes, but if you sell all of it, I think that is foolish. I think it’s an investment for the long term and will go way, way up.” Sunsetbutterfly’s response highlights a cautious yet forward-looking approach, advocating for partial profit-taking while retaining a substantial portion of XRP holdings for long-term growth. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 User Jiggy echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the importance of diversifying holding strategies: “Holding for the long haul. Will sell some along the way but not until we reach 3 digits. I will leave a big bag to hold for a long long long time that my kids can enjoy.” Jiggy’s viewpoint reflects a generational wealth-building philosophy, suggesting that XRP may be a valuable legacy asset for future generations. Implications for the XRP Community The variety of opinions shared in response to XRP Avengers’ tweet highlights an important debate within the XRP community . While some investors aim for more modest targets, planning to sell between $10 and $50, others are committed to holding out for triple or even quadruple-digit price levels. These divergent strategies demonstrate the wide spectrum of investor confidence and financial planning among XRP holders. As the digital asset market evolves, it remains uncertain whether XRP will achieve the ambitious price levels envisioned by its most optimistic supporters. However, the discussion underscores a broader principle in crypto investing: each individual must define their goals, risk tolerance, and timeline.

With over $10.6 million raised in its presale at a price of $0.004875, Lightchain AI is emerging as a promising project offering massive growth potential. Experts are now weighing whether this rising star could outshine XRP in the long run. Ripple’s Rise Story Behind the Surge Ripple’s cryptocurrency, XRP, has experienced a remarkable surge, reaching a six-year high of $2.49. This growth is driven by several key factors. First, expectations surrounding the resignation of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, effective January 2025, have fostered optimism for a more supportive regulatory landscape for crypto. Additionally, there is increasing speculation about the potential approval of a spot XRP Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF), which could make it easier for institutional investors to participate in the market. Lastly, the overall positive sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, largely influenced by Bitcoin’s rise, has contributed to the momentum of altcoins like XRP. Together, these factors have solidified XRP’s position as a leading cryptocurrency with strong growth potential. Lightchain AI Hidden Gem on Every Investor’s Radar While XRP focuses on cross-border payments, Lightchain AI is redefining the game by fusing artificial intelligence directly into its blockchain. This groundbreaking approach doesn’t just fix inefficiencies—it creates entirely new opportunities for growth. What makes Lightchain AI truly stand out? AI-driven scalability that uses machine learning to supercharge transaction speeds and a decentralized governance model that puts power in the hands of token holders, building trust and transparency. With its presale almost over, now’s your chance to grab tokens at a highly favorable price. Lightchain AI is shaping up to be the next big thing in crypto—don’t miss out! Smart Bet for the Future As XRP gains momentum due to its established utility, Lightchain AI is positioning itself as a transformative player in the cryptocurrency space. With innovative features, strong presale performance, and significant growth potential, it presents an attractive opportunity for investors looking to diversify beyond traditional options. Lightchain AI’s roadmap sets out a well-defined path to growth, with key milestones including the testnet launch in January 2025 and the mainnet activation in March 2025. This structured approach underscores its commitment to innovation and scalability. The LCAI token has a total supply of 10 billion, allocated as follows – 40% for presale, 28.5% for staking rewards, 15% for liquidity, 5% for marketing, 6.5% for the treasury, and 5% for the team. This carefully planned distribution supports sustainability and equitable participation within the ecosystem. For investors seeking the next major opportunity in cryptocurrency, Lightchain AI stands out as a project with the vision, technology, and momentum to achieve substantial returns. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf Tweets by LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,XRP|BUSINESS|TRADING|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-22 03:00:00

33767162,[object Object],1737514832,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Crypto Madness: REXShares And Osprey File For TRUMP, BONK, And DOGE ETFs",https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-madness-trump-bonk-and-doge-etfs/,"Amid the fervor generated by the latest launches of President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania’s memecoins, REX Shares and Osprey, have captured attention by submitting filings for ETFs associated with several of the most popular cryptos: TRUMP, Bonk Inu (BONK), and Dogecoin (DOGE). New ETFs Targeting Memecoins And Major Cryptos The filing , disclosed by James Seyffart, a Bloomberg ETF expert, also includes ETFs for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana SOL), and XRP. Notably, these products are filed under the 1940 Act, similar to crypto futures ETFs, allowing them to hold a mix of derivatives and assets through a Cayman subsidiary. Seyffart highlighted that this structure is reminiscent of strategies used in commodity ETFs, designed to minimize tax complications, particularly avoiding K-1 forms, which can allegedly complicate tax filings for investors. The newly proposed funds aim to provide exposure to their respective reference assets through investments in a subsidiary organized in the Cayman Islands, called the REX-Osprey TRUMP (Cayman) Portfolio S.P. This subsidiary will be wholly owned by the fund and is expected to hold no more than 25% of the fund’s total assets. This approach not only allows for diversified investment strategies but also helps the fund meet the income sourcing requirements established under the Internal Revenue Code. Digital Assets ETF Filings Surge To 33: Experts Predict Further Growth The fund’s structure is also classified as “non-diversified” under the Investment Company Act of 1940, allowing it greater flexibility in its investment decisions. Additionally, the fund intends to allocate its remaining assets to various cash investments such as US Treasuries, money market funds , and other high-quality cash equivalents, aimed to enhance liquidity and provide a safeguard for the fund’s investments. The momentum of these filings reflects a broader trend in the crypto market, as Eric Balchunas, Seyffart’s colleague, pointed out that the number of crypto ETFs filed with the SEC has now reached an impressive 33. The recent regulatory environment has seen a doubling of filings since Gary Gensler’s departure from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Friday, with expectations that this number could swell to 50 in the coming weeks. However, Balchunas cautions that while the influx of new ETFs is exciting, the majority of investment capital will likely continue to flow into spot Bitcoin ETFs . Balchunas likens the crypto market to the commodities sector, where gold remains dominant while silver and lesser-known commodities like palladium and aluminum occupy niche positions. In this landscape, mainstream cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are expected to attract the bulk of investment, while memecoins may find themselves in a more fringe position, the expert further asserted. At the time of writing, the President’s official memecoin, TRUMP, was trading at $39,044, down 50% from its peak of $79 over the weekend.

This notable indicator known as the Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (STH SOPR) which reveals the behavior of Short-Term Holders (STHs) has shown that STHs have started to sell at a loss. This metric compares 30-day STH SOPR to its 365-day counterpart and provides insight into whether short-term investors are realizing profits or losses. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin’s Upward Cycle Back? Key Insights Into The Latest Recovery Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Realized Losses To grasp what the Short-Term Holder’s current selling at a loss means for the market, it’s important to first understand its broader market implications. Darkfost, the CryptoQuant analyst behind the revelation of this data reveals that when STH SOPR turns negative, two scenarios often unfold “holding” and “capitulation” The analyst mentioned that some STHs may hold their BTC, using their realized price as a potential support level, while others could capitulate, triggering further corrections. Historically, these periods of STH losses have marked attractive entry points for long-term investors.

In Darkfost words: Historically, when this metric turns negative, it often highlights attractive entry points for the long term. However, it’s essential to confirm such signals by cross-referencing with other metrics and assessing the broader market sentiment. MVRV Ratio Highlights Potential Market Trends Besides the STH realized losses suggesting potential attractive entry points for long-term investors, Bitcoin’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio has also indicated an interesting trend incoming for Bitcoin. Another CryptoQuant analyst known as Tugbachain recently shared in a post on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform that currently, the MVRV ratio stands at 2.4, and it is approaching a key support level. If it breaks below this support and then reverses its downtrend, it could climb back into the 4-6 range historically associated with Bitcoin peaks, the analyst reveals. For context, the MVRV ratio is an indicator that measures whether a cryptocurrency is overvalued or undervalued by comparing its market capitalization to the value at which it was last moved.

According to Tugbachain, over multiple halving cycles, the MVRV ratio has proven to be a reliable tool for identifying market tops and bottoms, as well as shorter-term fluctuations adding credibility to the latest indication.

Pro-XRP Lawyer John Deaton Weighs In,https://coinpedia.org/news/is-trumps-meme-coin-a-threat-to-cryptos-future-pro-xrp-lawyer-john-deaton-weighs-in/,"The post Is Trump’s Meme Coin a Threat to Crypto’s Future? Pro-XRP Lawyer John Deaton Weighs In appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Attorney John Deaton recently shared his thoughts on the launch of the Trump meme coin. The crypto community is split and some people believe Trump’s meme coin will attract new investors and help crypto gain more acceptance. Others, like Deaton, are worried that it could harm the industry’s credibility. For Deaton, the issue isn’t the meme coins themselves but the broader implications they have for the crypto industry’s reputation. On the Good Morning Crypto Show, he warned that while meme coins can attract attention and investors, they may also contribute to the public perception of crypto as a “casino” or speculative market, rather than a legitimate technology with real-world utility. Deaton’s concern is that if meme coins dominate the conversation, it could overshadow the more serious and transformative potential of blockchain technology. “I think we’ve been fighting for crypto survival for the past five years, but now we have to fight for legitimacy,” he said. Deaton fears that if the industry doesn’t push for real utility and focus on solving world problems, it may become mired in hype and speculation. Looking Ahead “We must not just survive, but serve,” he said, stressing the importance of pushing for blockchain technology that can truly solve global problems. If meme coins like Trump continue to dominate, the public perception of crypto could shift towards viewing it as a speculative gamble. He believes that the new leadership could allow for a more balanced approach to crypto regulation, one that doesn’t unfairly target legitimate projects like Ripple, Coinbase, and others. “We witnessed a war against crypto. But I have a concern and my concern is that in this country sometimes we have this tendency to go from one extreme to the other extreme. So we’ve had this completely unfair war against crypto and that doesn’t mean we want complete freedom for all where there are no rules, no regulations,” Deaton said.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,TECHNOLOGY|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-22 03:06:24

Among the emerging stars in this space, meme coins have carved out a unique identity, blending humour and community spirit to attract investors. Initially laughed off as mere jokes, these coins have proven their worth, demonstrating that they can provide real financial opportunities. As the market expands, meme coins are increasingly recognised as vital components of the economic landscape. Over the years, the popularity of meme coins has surged, thanks to their viral nature and community-driven ethos. Coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have paved the way, sparking interest from casual investors and crypto enthusiasts alike. Now, BTFD Coin is stepping into the limelight, poised to elevate meme coin popularity to unprecedented heights. With its play-to-earn (P2E) game , enticing referral programme, and rewarding staking options, BTFD Coin is all about harnessing community power to create value for its holders. In this article, we’ll dive into the world of BTFD Coin, Mog Coin, and Neiro, exploring each project in detail. These coins are among the best new meme coins with 100x potential, each bringing unique features and opportunities to the table. But which one should you put your money on? Let’s explore! BTFD Coin: A Presale Wonder BTFD Coin is making headlines for all the right reasons. It’s been a hot topic in the crypto community, especially with its presale performance, which has already surpassed a staggering $5.4 million in just the first month. Currently priced at $0.00016, BTFD Coin has ignited excitement among investors. But hold onto your hats, because there’s more! The presale is skipping straight to Stage 15, meaning all unsold tokens from previous stages will be burnt, drastically reducing supply. This is a big deal! Fewer tokens mean stronger demand, and the buzz around BTFD Coin is palpable. And let’s not forget the incredible bonus offer: use the code LAUNCH100 during the presale to double your tokens! If you’re searching for the best new meme coins with 100x potential, this is an opportunity you can’t afford to miss. How To Claim LAUNCH100 Bonus Code Claiming the LAUNCH100 bonus is a breeze! First, visit the presale page at Buy BTFD Coin . Connect your wallet by clicking “Connect Wallet” and select either MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Next, find the bonus code field, enter LAUNCH100 in ALL CAPS, and hit “Apply.” Confirm the message in your wallet to activate the code. Then, input how much $BTFD you want to purchase, click “Buy Now,” and, Confirm the transaction. It’s that simple! This bonus offers a fantastic chance to significantly increase your holdings. Don’t let this slip through your fingers; the clock is ticking! Mog Coin: In The Green Mog Coin is another contender in the meme coin arena, and it’s been holding its ground quite well. While it might not have the explosive growth of BTFD Coin, Mog Coin is certainly in the green, steadily gaining traction. Its branding is clever, tapping into the meme culture in a way that’s relatable to younger audiences. What sets Mog Coin apart is its focus on community and utility. Unlike some meme coins that thrive solely on hype, Mog Coin offers tangible benefits, including staking rewards and governance features. This approach not only fosters a loyal community but also encourages users to invest long-term. For those looking for stability among the best new meme coins with 100x potential, Mog Coin may just hit the sweet spot. However, while Mog Coin’s performance is commendable, it may not deliver the rapid gains some investors hope for. It’s a solid option for those who appreciate a more gradual growth strategy and want to be part of something meaningful. The community-driven nature of Mog Coin is appealing, especially for those who want to feel connected to their investments. Additionally, as the crypto market continues to evolve, Mog Coin could very well surprise us. If it ramps up its marketing and community engagement, it might just become a sleeper hit among the best new meme coins with 100x potential. Neiro: A Rising Star Let’s turn our attention to Neiro, which is carving out its niche as a rising star in the meme coin market. It’s gaining momentum and positioning itself as one of the best new meme coins with 100x potential. Neiro combines fun and utility, creating an engaging experience for its community. Neiro’s vision goes beyond being just another meme coin. It aims to create an interactive ecosystem where users can participate in various activities, from gaming to social engagement. This multifaceted approach keeps the community invested and engaged, which is crucial for long-term success. The more users interact with the platform, the more they’ll want to hold onto their tokens, driving demand. What’s exciting about Neiro is its growth potential. If it continues to innovate and maintain strong community engagement, it could easily become a favourite among investors. For those looking for something that offers both fun and functionality, Neiro might just be the ticket. It’s all about finding that balance between hype and substance, and Neiro seems to be striking the right chords. As we look to the future, Neiro’s potential seems strong. If it can capitalize on current trends and keep its community engaged, it could become one of the best new meme coins with 100x potential, making it a worthy consideration for investors. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin clearly stands out as the leader among the best new meme coins with 100x potential. Its remarkable presale performance, innovative features, and community-driven ethos make it an appealing choice for anyone looking to invest. With over $5.4 million raised and an enticing bonus offer, the opportunity for significant returns is undeniable. While Mog Coin and Neiro each have their strengths, they currently lag behind the momentum that BTFD Coin has built. Don’t miss out on the chance to join a project that’s poised for greatness.

In a landmark decision that sent waves through the Bitcoin community, President Donald Trump has granted a full and unconditional pardon to Ross Ulbricht, the creator of the Silk Road darknet marketplace. Delivered on January 21, 2025—one day later than his campaign promise—this pardon goes beyond merely commuting Ulbricht’s sentence. It’s a symbolic gesture, perhaps acknowledging the delay with goodwill. For Bitcoiners, this represents more than justice for one man—it’s a signal of potential alignment between the administration and the values Bitcoin embodies. The pardon follows a flurry of executive orders signed on Trump’s first day back in office, underscoring the administration’s focus on a myriad of national priorities. However, this act stands out, particularly for Bitcoiners, as a commitment to keeping promises, sparking hope for pro-Bitcoin legislation and progress on issues like the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Ross Ulbricht’s Silk Road wasn’t just a marketplace—it was Bitcoin’s first major use case. Launched in 2011, when Bitcoin was still in its infancy, the Silk Road demonstrated the revolutionary potential of decentralized, censorship-resistant money. While its operations drew criticism for facilitating illicit trade, it also showcased Bitcoin’s ability to enable peer-to-peer, anonymous transactions. Ulbricht’s double life sentence became a symbol of overreach—a clash between an inflexible system and the frontier spirit of technological innovation. For many in the Bitcoin community, his case represented the broader struggle for autonomy, privacy, and the freedom to innovate. His pardon is now being celebrated as a victory for these principles. The news of Ulbricht’s pardon has energized Bitcoiners, but it also highlights unresolved issues. The Samourai Wallet developers could still face prison time for developing Bitcoin privacy tools. Edward Snowden, another figure celebrated within the Bitcoin community, remains in exile. (Snowden’s revelations about mass surveillance have made him a key voice at Bitcoin conferences, aligning his values with the ethos of financial and personal privacy that Bitcoin embodies.) While Ulbricht’s freedom is a win, the incomplete picture of justice for figures like the Samourai Wallet developers and Snowden reminds us of the broader challenges in protecting digital rights. Ulbricht’s pardon is a significant moment, not just for him but for what it represents: A possible shift in how innovators and pioneers are treated when they challenge existing norms. It also signals that the current administration may be open to reevaluating policies around technology and privacy—issues that deeply resonate with Bitcoiners. The Bitcoin community’s long-standing support for Ulbricht underscores the movement’s commitment to privacy, autonomy, and resistance to overreach. Yet, as celebrations continue, there’s recognition that this is just one step in a larger journey toward protecting those who push the boundaries of innovation. For Bitcoiners, this moment is both a celebration and a rallying cry—a signal to keep pushing for a future where technology empowers individuals and where justice and innovation can coexist.

Ulbricht was serving a life sentence after being convicted for running the platform, which facilitated over $200 million in illegal transactions, including drug sales, using Bitcoin. Trump shared the news on Truth Social, revealing that he personally called Ulbricht’s mother to inform her of the decision. The president said that the pardon was granted in honor of her and the libertarian movement, which had supported him. He also criticized those responsible for Ulbricht’s conviction and said “The scum that worked to convict him were some of the same lunatics who were involved in the modern day weaponization of the government against me.” Background of Ross Ulbricht and Silk Road Ross Ulbricht, born in 1984, created Silk Road, an online marketplace that operated on the dark web. His platform gained worldwide attention for enabling anonymous, unregulated trade in illegal substances, which ultimately led to his arrest in 2013. Ulbricht was convicted in 2015 on multiple charges, including conspiracy to traffic narcotics, money laundering, and computer hacking, receiving two life sentences without the possibility of parole. Silk Road’s existence posed challenges to law enforcement, raising questions about digital privacy, free markets, and the balance between technology and regulation. Despite the illegal activities, Ulbricht’s supporters argue that his life sentence was excessively harsh, especially considering his lack of a prior criminal record. The decision to pardon Ulbricht has sparked mixed reactions, with some praising Trump’s stance on criminal justice reform and others questioning the message it sends regarding accountability for illegal actions. Ulbricht’s case has been a major topic of debate for years, with many in the crypto and libertarian communities advocating for his release.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BTC|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-22 03:26:02

ETH is consolidating above $3,150 and might aim for an upside break. Ethereum failed to gain pace for a close above $3,400 and $3,450. The price is trading above $3,300 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key contracting triangle forming with resistance at $3,355 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears the $3,400 resistance level. Ethereum Price Aims Key Upside Break Ethereum price started a decent upward move from the $3,200 level but upsides were limited compared to Bitcoin . ETH cleared the $3,250 resistance to move into a short-term bullish zone. The bulls were able to push the price above the $3,300 resistance zone. Besides, there was a clear move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,445 swing high to the $3,203 low. However, the bears are still active below $3,400. Ethereum price is now trading above $3,300 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $3,350 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,445 swing high to the $3,203 low. There is also a key contracting triangle forming with resistance at $3,355 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The first major resistance is near the $3,400 level. The main resistance is now forming near $3,445. A clear move above the $3,445 resistance might send the price toward the $3,550 resistance. An upside break above the $3,550 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,650 resistance zone or even $3,720 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,400 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,300 level. The first major support sits near the $3,250. A clear move below the $3,250 support might push the price toward the $3,200 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,120 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,050. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.

Elon Musk Salute (MUSKSAL), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKSAL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Elon Musk Salute can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Musk Salute could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Musk Salute launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Musk Salute on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Musk Salute by entering its contract address – GmFHmHWARyCD1FHVHiCc3kXZPwCDvzR5gFu2sFeeGphP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKSAL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-22 03:32:00

This frenzy has caught the attention of billionaire investor Mark Cuban, who is now contemplating the creation of his own memecoin, inspired by the recent memecoin movements. Cuban’s Memecoin Vision: Combining Fun And Financial Responsibility? In a recent social media post, the renowned billionaire opened the door to the possibility of launching a new memecoin, stating, “If memecoins are the way, maybe I’ll issue one.” His announcement has stirred curiosity among crypto enthusiasts, particularly as he hinted that his memecoin would mirror the parameters of Trump’s TRUMP memecoin. Related Reading: Is It Time To Give Up On Ethereum Below $4,000? Analyst Weighs The Facts Cuban plans to implement a 20% float and adhere to a similar release schedule, with one significant distinction: all potential revenue generated from the sale would be directed to the US Treasury. To enhance transparency, Cuban also indicated that the wallet address would be publicly accessible, allowing anyone to track the funds. Cuban framed his initiative as a way to combine entertainment with a social purpose, noting, “If you want to gamble, gamble. But at least use it to make a dent in the US debt.” This statement reflects a growing sentiment among some investors that memecoins can serve a dual purpose—providing both amusement and potential benefits to broader societal issues. However, Cuban’s proposal has not been without its critics. Cuban Cites Dogecoin Success In response to Cuban’s announcement, a user on X (formerly Twitter) cautioned him about the potential pitfalls of launching a memecoin, suggesting that he might be accused of exploiting information asymmetry at the coin’s launch. The user stressed that the supposed memecoin’s price would be dictated by supply and demand dynamics, starting from nearly zero, and warned Cuban not to proceed without careful consideration. Cuban, undeterred by the criticism, defended his understanding of the memecoin landscape, stating, “It’s not hard to put it together. I never have thought about doing a meme coin. Wouldn’t be hard at all.” Related Reading: Big Players Bet Big On XRP, Solana With Excitement Around Donald Trump’s Presidency, Here Are The Figures The back-and-forth dialogue continued, with the user asserting that creating a sustainable memecoin that benefits long-term holders is a challenging endeavor. He further argued that successful memecoins often emerge from community-driven initiatives rather than top-down launches, warning that hype surrounding a celebrity-backed launch could lead to short-term trading rather than fostering an organic community. Cuban concluded the exchange by acknowledging the importance of community in the longevity of memecoins. He cited examples like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), which have thrived due to their strong communities. “I’m not saying buyers won’t get rekt. I said it was gambling. It’s a game of musical chairs. No promises. No pumps by me. Just complete transparency,” he emphasized. At the time of writing, the TRUMP memecoin is trading at $44,778, recording a 14% recovery in the past 24 hours after plunging over 50% from its $79 peak reached over the weekend.

Pepe Loves Bezos (PEPEBEZO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEBEZO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Loves Bezos can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Loves Bezos could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Loves Bezos launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Loves Bezos on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Loves Bezos by entering its contract address – 5fminHHGkusginuqs4jjR2qivagMWWBStM2Hs21HVLcm – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEBEZO. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|DOGE|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-22 04:55:00

This famous meme coin has shown formidable power in the past growth, and many are putting their bets on that barking rally which may just propel it to $0.50 or more during the coming months. Even amidst all the fuss surrounding it, however, some other altcoin is secretly preparing for the big take-up with a potential 50x increase at most after the Trump inauguration rally, Rollblock, which is a completely new ramping-up cryptocurrency now getting real both for investors and gamers alike. Why Dogecoin is Poised for a Rally The Dogecoin surge after President Trump’s inauguration is highly anticipated by a number of cryptocurrency folk. After big world events, Dogecoin has a historical propensity for robust price increases, and analysts predict this trend will hold true after Trump’s Inauguration Ceremony. The price changes of the meme coin have frequently been driven by social media phenomena, celebrity promotion, and general recognition. Using a very active community and the support of mainstream celebrities (e.g., Elon Musk), Dogecoin may experience tremendous growth in the short term. As a result of the Musk connection, Dogecoin values have skyrocketed, generating much of the media frenzy. Meaningful applications and high community support that could lead to rapid growth. Rollblock’s Potential in the Cryptocurrency Space As Rollblock continues to garner attention for its Revenue Share model and blockchain transparency, its potential to surpass Dogecoin in growth becomes more apparent. The focus on real-world applications, transparency, and tangible value makes Rollblock a rising star in the cryptocurrency growth potential 50x market. As investors prioritize functional cryptocurrencies over speculative assets, Dogecoin may struggle to keep pace with Rollblock and other emerging high-utility tokens in 2025. In addition to its distinctive approach to decentralized gaming, Rollblock is becoming more well-known for its capacity to address pressing issues in the iGaming sector. As it provides users with real value, Rollblock may surpass Dogecoin by providing features like blockchain transparency. Although Dogecoin has a sizable user base, Rollblock provides something Dogecoin does not: useful applications and robust community support that might spur exponential growth. Rollblock is positioned as an alluring investment possibility in the cryptocurrency growth potential 50x space thanks to its Revenue Share model, which guarantees that token holders directly profit from the platform’s success. Rollblock’s decentralized platform has the potential to upend the market and completely change the way gaming activities are conducted as the iGaming industry becomes more transparent and regulated. At this point, the difference between high-utility tokens like Rollblock and Dogecoin following the Trump inauguration rally widnes. It is evident that Rollblock provides greater long-term value, even though Dogecoin’s post-Trump inauguration surge is anticipated to provide short-term price increases. Rollblock’s community-driven methodology and blockchain-based transparency are revolutionizing the practical application of decentralized networks. Instead of being just a speculative asset like Dogecoin, it is meeting a practical demand in a rapidly expanding sector. Rollblock is without a doubt among the best altcoins for high returns for investors wishing to make a wise choice. Unlike Dogecoin, which can keep fluctuating based on social media excitement, Rollblock has established a strong basis that should lead to long-term growth. In the upcoming years, Rollblock’s open, revenue-sharing ecosystem is probably going to garner more notice as investors continue to look for more creative initiatives. Conclusion While Dogecoin post-Trump inauguration rally is an exciting prospect, the future of cryptocurrency growth potential 50 x may lie with altcoins that offer more than just hype. Best altcoins for high returns could include those that solve real-world problems, have strong community engagement, and show consistent development. As the market continues to evolve, Dogecoin may face significant competition from newer projects with greater growth potential, such as Rollblock. Keep an eye on the horizon and be prepared for the next big altcoin that could surpass Dogecoin with 50x growth. Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

This performance has further highlighted the disparity between Bitcoin and Ethereum’s price trajectories, with Ethereum underperforming in recent months. While Bitcoin has captured attention for its resilience and gains, Ethereum faces challenges that have weighed on its progress. According to Percival, a CryptoQuant analyst, the new regulatory clarity provided by the pro-crypto administration in the US is contributing to Bitcoin’s strength. In contrast, Ethereum’s internal difficulties, coupled with declining demand in the spot market, have created a challenging environment for the asset. This divergence highlights how the two leading cryptocurrencies are currently moving along very different paths, with Bitcoin thriving and Ethereum struggling to maintain its footing. Related Reading: 1 Million Bitcoin Pulled From Exchanges In The Past 3 Years: What It Means For The BTC Market Ethereum’s Decline and Market Sentiment Percival pointed out that Ethereum’s struggles can be seen in several key metrics. Spot market transactions have dropped dramatically since the previous cycle, with current volumes at $8 billion compared to $52 billion during the bull market’s peak in early 2021. This represents a sharp reduction in demand, signaling that Ethereum’s current bull market participation is significantly diminished. Additionally, data shows that Ethereum has returned to levels seen in 2016, with a majority of trading days now classified as “unprofitable” when compared to Bitcoin. These challenges, according to Percival, have prompted concerns that Ethereum may need to establish a “bottom” before it can regain stability. Without this stabilization, investor sentiment could become increasingly volatile, potentially leading to further price declines. The analyst also suggests that until Ethereum can address its internal issues and rebuild confidence, its underperformance relative to Bitcoin is likely to persist. Bitcoin Momentum And Market Structure While Ethereum struggles, Bitcoin continues to benefit from favorable market conditions and positive sentiment. Percival notes that macroeconomic factors, along with increasing regulatory clarity, have positioned Bitcoin for continued growth. The Choppiness Index, an indicator of market consolidation and trend readiness, currently signals that Bitcoin has built the necessary strength to sustain its upward trajectory. The analyst believes that Bitcoin’s current market structure supports further gains in the coming days. Particularly, after a period of consolidation, Bitcoin appears poised to extend its rally, attracting more investor interest and reinforcing its position as the leading cryptocurrency.

The block trade, considered a proxy for institutional activity, is consistent with forecasts for SOL outperformance under Donald Trump's presidency.

I haven’t checked.” When informed by a reporter that TRUMP had generated billions in market activity within days of its release, Trump quipped, “Several billion? That’s peanuts for these guys,” gesturing toward SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, OpenAI’s Sam Altman, and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, who were present in the room . TRUMP meme coin’s performance The Solana-based TRUMP memecoin achieved a market cap of over $13 billion during its peak over the weekend but has since seen significant volatility. It was the fastest coin to do so and also briefly overtook Shiba Inu as the second biggest meme token in the world after Dogecoin. Its market cap has fallen to approximately $8 billion, with the token currently trading around $42. The decline followed the announcement that First Lady Melania Trump had launched her own memecoin , fueling speculation about potential oversupply and insider ownership. The supply of both tokens is widely believed to be controlled by individuals within the Trump circle, raising questions about market manipulation and ethical implications. TRUMP meme coin’s troubles The rapid rise of the TRUMP memecoin has sparked significant attention across the cryptocurrency ecosystem, with major exchanges like Coinbase and Robinhood listing the token. However, the project’s high-profile nature could complicate bipartisan efforts to pass crypto market structure legislation. A report by TD Cowen warned that the memecoin could introduce partisan tensions as lawmakers and regulators investigate its market implications. Critics argue that the memecoin’s speculative nature may detract from broader crypto reforms aimed at establishing a more transparent and secure financial system. The coins also drew major criticism from the community. Ryan Selkis, former CEO of crypto research firm Messari and a vocal Trump supporter, criticised the decision to proceed with the launch of a second coin, urging President Trump to dismiss the adviser responsible. “They don’t know what they’re doing, they’ve cost you significant money and goodwill, and they don’t have your best interests at heart,” Selkis said in a social media post shortly after the launch of the $MELANIA token. Observers likened the token mechanisms to a “rug pull,” a term used in crypto to describe projects that are abandoned shortly after launch, often resulting in investor losses. Criticism has also centered on the ownership structure, as 80% of the $TRUMP token’s supply is controlled by Fight Fight Fight and CIC Digital, entities affiliated with the Trump Organization, according to the token’s associated website. Furthermore, the terms and conditions for both $TRUMP and $MELANIA prohibit buyers from participating in class-action lawsuits and indemnify the project from any claims. Trump’s pro-crypto promises President Trump has signaled an intent to make cryptocurrency a central pillar of his administration’s policy. He is reportedly preparing an executive order to set cryptocurrency as a national priority. David Sacks, a prominent investor and tech executive, is expected to lead the administration’s crypto efforts as the newly appointed “crypto czar.” Under Trump, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has unveiled a cryptocurrency task force aimed at developing a long-anticipated regulatory framework for digital assets. The announcement follows the resignation of the SEC’s head, Gary Gensler, and the appointment of Mark Uyeda as acting chairman by President Trump. The task force will be led by Hester Peirce, a well-known advocate for cryptocurrencies, The post 'I don’t know much about it': President Trump on meme coin launch appeared first on Invezz",Crypto|Meme Coin|World|Donald Trump|USA,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|SHIB|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Invezz', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",invezz,2025-01-22 05:17:14

Brian Armstrong Weighs New Regulatory Landscape,https://coinpedia.org/news/coinbase-to-delist-usdt-brian-armstrong-weighs-new-regulatory-landscape/,"The post Coinbase to Delist USDT? Brian Armstrong Weighs New Regulatory Landscape appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Trump’s latest remarks after his inauguration on crypto regulations have created a euphoric moment for Bitcoin and other assets. Bitcoin came out of the choppy market with a smashing ATH of $109K. However, there is still fear and panic in the market as many think this new policy change may impact non-US entities. Raining serious doubt and to stay out of controversy, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has hinted that the exchange may delist Tether’s USDT stablecoin if new U.S. legislation mandates stricter compliance requirements. The statement comes as the U.S. crypto industry anticipates regulatory changes that could reshape the stablecoin market. COINBASE CEO: TETHER MIGHT GET KICKED OFF IF THEY DON’T FOLLOW NEW US RULES Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong just dropped a bomb—if US stablecoin regs demand full Treasury backing, Tether’s gonna have to comply or get booted. He said they’d delist USDt if it doesn’t make the cut.… pic.twitter.com/R1waWm73vA — Mario Nawfal’s Roundtable (@RoundtableSpace) January 21, 2025 Regulatory Shifts Could Challenge Tether In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Armstrong predicted that future U.S. regulations might require stablecoin issuers to back their reserves exclusively with U.S. Treasury bonds and undergo regular audits. While Tether already holds a significant portion of its reserves in Treasury bonds, it also diversifies with commodities like Bitcoin and gold, which could put it at odds with potential legislation. The CEO highlighted issues Tether has already faced in the EU under the MiCA framework, which has imposed stricter rules on stablecoin issuers. A similar regulatory push in the U.S. could severely disrupt Tether’s operations, despite its recent move to El Salvador to mitigate regulatory risks. Coinbase’s Position in the Stablecoin Market Armstrong emphasized Coinbase’s readiness to comply with any new laws, even if it means delisting USDT. He also highlighted Coinbase’s relationship with Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, which has positioned itself as a direct competitor to Tether. As a major shareholder in Circle, Coinbase could benefit from a regulatory environment that favors USDC, especially in the U.S. and European markets. Armstrong noted that the stablecoin market, currently valued at $218.7 billion, could see significant shifts if Tether is sidelined by new legislation. Why a Fear for Non-US Entities? Although the U.S. government is showing signs of a more crypto-friendly regulatory stance, enforcement actions remain a possibility, particularly for non-U.S. entities like Tether. Armstrong mentioned that two Senate bills aiming to impose restrictions on stablecoin issuers have been introduced but have yet to gain traction. Armstrong is sure that they will support the changing regulatory scenario even if it means supporting measures that could disrupt Tether’s dominance. This development signals a potential shake-up in the stablecoin market, with implications for both issuers and users.

Additionally, the price of Dogecoin (DOGE) surged after the launch of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) website. However, the website does not mean smooth sailing for the department as it still faces legal scrutiny over transparency concerns. Ross Ulbricht Pardoned by President Trump US President Donald Trump has granted a full pardon to Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the infamous darknet marketplace, Silk Road. Ulbricht spent 12 years in prison, and his supporters, including some well known people in the cryptocurrency community, advocated for years for his pardon. The pardon was announced on the Truth Social platform, and Trump stated that the decision was made in honor of Ulbricht’s mother and the Libertarian Movement, which strongly supported his presidential campaign. He described Ulbricht’s initial sentence of 40 years plus two life terms as “ridiculous.” (Source: Truth Social ) Ulbricht was arrested in 2013 and convicted in 2015 for operating Silk Road, a platform that facilitated the anonymous exchange of goods, including illegal items, using Bitcoin. The platform played a big role in Bitcoin’s early adoption but also drew a lot of legal scrutiny. Trump’s decision is part of his campaign promise to pardon Ulbricht on his first day in office. However, some people were still rather disappointed when Trump prioritized pardons for those connected to the January 6 Capitol attack. The pardon also came after a public appeal from US Senator Rand Paul. He argued that Ulbricht’s sentence was disproportionately harsh compared to others involved in Silk Road operations. Paul specifically referred to the case of Matthew Verran Jones, a high-ranking drug dealer on the platform. Jones received a far lighter sentence of six years. This fueled arguments from Ulbricht’s supporters who believed that he was unfairly vilified and very excessively punished. Throughout the years, Ulbricht consistently contested claims that he was the sole creator and operator of Silk Road, and pointed out that he inherited the platform from its original developer. In a 2013 Forbes interview , he claimed that his involvement was limited to continuing the work of his predecessor, who initially conceptualized the use of Bitcoin and Tor for anonymous transactions. Despite these claims, Ulbricht still became a polarizing figure as some called him a visionary and others were not happy with his role in facilitating illicit trade. Silk Road was among the first platforms to integrate Bitcoin, and it played a huge role in its rise during 2011, when the cryptocurrency reached a then-record price of $32. Amir Taaki and billionaire investor Tim Draper credited Ulbricht’s work with advancing Bitcoin’s prominence. Taaki even referred to Ulbricht’s imprisonment as “the ultimate sacrifice,” especially when considering just how his contributions laid the groundwork for the crypto ecosystem’s growth. During his incarceration, Ulbricht stayed active in the crypto world, and even shared his thoughts on platforms like X. Just days before his pardon, he also warned the community about a fake meme coin bearing his name. Crypto Mom Leads New SEC Crypto Task Force The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) took some of its first steps toward regulatory clarity in the crypto sector after the departure of former Chair Gary Gensler. On Jan. 21, the agency announced that it formed a dedicated crypto task force that will develop a comprehensive framework for digital assets. This initiative will be led by Commissioner Hester Peirce, who is also widely recognized as ”Crypto Mom.” SEC press release The task force was introduced by acting SEC Chairman Mark Uyeda , who is temporarily overseeing the agency until the Senate confirms Paul Atkins, a former SEC Commissioner, as the new chair. According to the SEC, the task force will focus on establishing clear regulatory guidelines, creating pathways for compliance, developing sensible disclosure requirements, and deploying enforcement efforts more effectively. Some of the key appointments to the task force include Richard Gabbert as chief of staff and Taylor Asher as chief policy adviser. The group plans to engage in industry consultations through roundtable discussions to better understand the challenges that are faced by the crypto sector. Additionally, the task force will collaborate with other federal agencies, including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which is led by Acting Chair Caroline Pham, as well as state and international regulators. Historically, the SEC leaned very heavily on enforcement actions to address regulatory concerns in the crypto industry. Under Gensler and his predecessor Jay Clayton, the agency pursued numerous enforcement cases that very often alleged that crypto firms were offering unregistered securities. The regulatory crackdown intensified during the Biden administration, particularly after the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX. For now, President Trump’s second term is expected to bring clearer regulatory pathways for crypto businesses, including rules that define which tokens qualify as securities and clarify oversight responsibilities between federal agencies. Despite this anticipation, Trump has barely said anything on crypto policy since taking office on Jan. 20. Dogecoin Surges as Musk’s DOGE Agency Website Goes Live The ball is rolling in other crypto-related departments as well. Dogecoin (DOGE) surged by more than 11% after the launch of the official website for Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). DOGE is a non-governmental agency that is focused on reducing government spending and streamlining regulations. The agency’s website went live on Jan. 21, which caused a lot of enthusiasm among retail investors who see a symbolic connection between the agency and the cryptocurrency due to the shared acronym and logo. Official DOGE website After the website’s debut, Dogecoin’s price briefly climbed to $0.38 and even surpassed $0.40 before stabilizing at $0.37. Despite this rally, Dogecoin is still below its all-time high of $0.73 that was achieved on May 8 of 2021. However, the meme coin’s market cap has seen some impressive milestones recently, including surpassing Porsche’s $56.1 billion valuation in late 2024, fueled by Musk’s endorsements and speculation around a potential exchange-traded product (ETP) for Dogecoin. However, the Musk-led DOGE agency still faces legal challenges as the public interest law firm National Security Counselors announced plans to sue due to violations of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA). The law firm argues that DOGE failed to meet transparency requirements, including public access to meetings and proper record-keeping. A 30-page complaint states that DOGE’s operations must comply with federal regulations. DOGE’s mission is set to conclude on July 4, 2026, aiming to deliver a smaller, more efficient government to coincide with the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. While the agency’s goals align with Musk’s advocacy for efficiency, the legal and public scrutiny surrounding its operations certainly adds some uncertainty to its million and future plans.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|DOGE|BTC|TRADING|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-22 05:25:54

Launched on January 17, just days before his inauguration, the Solana-based token quickly reached a market cap of $13 billion over the weekend. However, it has since dropped to around $8 billion after a sharp 50% decline, following the launch of a competing memecoin by First Lady Melania Trump. Speaking to reporters, Trump admitted he wasn’t deeply involved in the project, saying, “I don’t know much about it other than I launched it,” but acknowledged its success. When told about its multi-billion-dollar valuation, he joked, “$8 billion? That’s peanuts for these guys,” referencing tech leaders like SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son and OpenAI’s Sam Altman, who were present at the event. However many think this is Trump’s strategy to recover his election campaign spending and this meme mania will fade soon once crypto guidelines are in place. #Trump responded to the $TRUMP token for the first time.

Since its launch, the token has been under fire without any clear crypto regulations it’s like a gamble to invest in memes. Trump’s administration is reportedly planning to make crypto a national policy priority, with an executive order in the works. David Sacks has been appointed as the administration’s crypto czar to guide these efforts. Despite its success, the TRUMP memecoin could complicate ongoing efforts to pass crypto legislation. Analysts warn that its association with Trump may increase political divisions, slowing progress on much-needed regulations. TD Cowen highlighted that investigations into the token’s insider ownership and market influence could further delay bipartisan agreements. Even Mark Cuban, a multi-billionaire and crypto investor believes that TRUMP coin is overhyped and it will be a scam to invest in such projects without clear regulations and will ruin crypto credibility. Getting into the topic of regulations recently Washington Post revealed that in one of Trump’s executive orders, there will be a repealing of controversial SEC crypto accounting guidance, SAB 121. Exchanges Listing TRUMP The TRUMP memecoin is getting more popular as platforms like Coinbase and Robinhood, trading at around $42, up 8.7% in the past 24 hours. Trump’s changing remarks and showing a lack of interest in knowing the memecoins is giving a cold vibe to the crypto investors. Critics are claiming that the token’s popularity might give a perception of crypto as a speculative coin and a gamble taking away its real-world use. The memecoin’s launch is clashing with major tech and Finance development, including a $500 billion AI infrastructure project involving OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank.

Ripple’s launch of RLUSD, a fully backed stablecoin that bridges XRP Ledger and Ethereum networks, coupled with its historic SEC victory, has strengthened market confidence. As XRP trades above $2, analysts project values reaching $15 by early 2025. There’s another project called PlutoChain ($PLUTO) that could be worth watching. This Layer-2 solution is getting traction for its potential to revolutionize Bitcoin’s transaction speed. Here’s a closer look at both of these projects. Will XRP Skyrocket to $15? Bold Predictions Point to a Breakout by March 2025 Ripple has recently achieved some big milestones that have strengthened its position in the crypto market. On December 17, 2024, the company launched its U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, Ripple USD (RLUSD) , fully backed by U.S. dollar deposits, government bonds, and cash equivalents. RLUSD is available on both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum blockchains, which ensures its accessibility and utility across different platforms. Initially, RLUSD is listed on exchanges such as Uphold, Bitso, MoonPay, Archax, and CoinMENA, with plans for further expansion to other platforms in the near future. In addition to the RLUSD launch, Ripple secured a favorable outcome in its legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The lawsuit, which began in December 2020, accused Ripple of conducting an unregistered securities offering through the sale of XRP. On July 13, 2023, the court ruled that XRP is not a security, which marked a significant victory for Ripple and the broader cryptocurrency industry. This decision has provided greater regulatory clarity and has been seen as a precedent-setting moment for digital assets in the United States. Following the announcement of RLUSD, XRP’s value experienced an uptick. The legal victory against the SEC has bolstered market sentiment even more, as it alleviated concerns over regulatory uncertainties surrounding XRP. Key resistance levels are identified at $2.25 and $2.30, with a significant hurdle near $2.40. Support levels are observed at $2.12 and $2.05, with a critical support zone around $2.00. Crypto analyst Javon Marks predicts XRP could hit $16.50 in its next growth phase, with the potential for a massive 7,200% surge to $111–$168 in a full market cycle. He notes that current trends suggest XRP is already on track to achieve this bullish outlook. PlutoChain ($PLUTO): A Layer-2 Solution that Could Transform Bitcoin’s Transaction Speed PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could offer a new approach to improving Bitcoin by introducing a Layer-2 solution that may enhance its capabilities. Bitcoin has long faced hurdles like sluggish transaction times, network congestion, and hefty fees, particularly during high-traffic periods. PlutoChain could address these pain points with an additional layer designed to process transactions faster and at a lower cost. With Bitcoin’s average transaction time of 10 minutes, it often lags behind quicker networks such as Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano. PlutoChain offers a block time of 2 seconds on its Layer-2 infrastructure, all while potentially preserving Bitcoin’s renowned security by linking back to its core blockchain. It also integrates with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) seamlessly, which could make it easier for Ethereum developers to build within Bitcoin’s ecosystem. This could create new possibilities for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, NFTs, and AI-powered projects to potentially leverage Bitcoin without complications. The PlutoChain testnet has already proven its ability to meet real-world demands by handling 43,000 transactions daily without experiencing delays. This shows it’s ready to scale for larger operations. The project has also passed rigorous audits from trusted names like SolidProof , QuillAudits , and Assure DeFi . Its governance system allows users to shape the platform’s future by voting on crucial updates, partnerships, and new features. With these advancements, PlutoChain might position itself as a game-changing solution that could address Bitcoin’s longstanding challenges and release its full potential. The Takeaway XRP has had quite a run lately – the RLUSD launch and the big SEC win have given it momentum beyond $2. Another exciting development could be PlutoChain ’s appearance as a potentially promising innovation that may solve Bitcoin’s scalability issues with its Layer-2 solution and EVM compatibility. ———————– This article is purely informational and should not be interpreted as financial advice.

Meanwhile, top market experts have tipped RCO Finance (RCOF) to become the top AI altcoin for 2025. With its innovative AI-powered platform and real-world asset tokenization, RCO Finance is poised for a staggering 30,000x run, making it a life-changing opportunity for investors. According to top market experts, this 30,000X potential will eclipse the historical Dogecoin price rally in 2021. Dogecoin Price Movement: A Concern for Investors As of January 20, 2025, available data on CoinGecko shows that the Dogecoin Price has fallen by over 11% in the last 24 hours. Additionally, DOGE has lost 5.9% of its value in the last 14 days. While the Dogecoin price movement remains a favorite among memecoin enthusiasts, its reliance on community sentiment and social media hype often leads to price volatility. Despite its popularity, the Dogecoin Price movement has struggled to sustain its upward price trajectory. This is where the AI altcoin, RCO Finance (RCOF) steps in, offering a more sustainable and innovative alternative with 30,000X growth potential. RCO Finance (RCOF): The AI Altcoin Revolution The AI altcoin, RCOF, is not just another crypto asset; it’s a groundbreaking AI-powered platform designed to democratize access to sophisticated investment strategies. Currently in its fourth presale stage, RCOF tokens are priced at $0.0777, with top market exerts projecting a historic price surge. With its unique value proposition and potential to revolutionize the $450 billion DeFi market, RCOF is poised for a 30,000X run. Leading market analysts strongly believe that the token will become the top AI altcoin in 2025. With the recent Dogecoin price stagnation, investors flock to this emerging potential gem. The New-Generation RCO Finance Ecosystem The ecosystem comprises cutting-edge and innovative technologies that include: AI-Powered Platform: The Intelligent Robo Advisor RCO Finance redefines financial management with its cutting-edge, AI-driven platform, designed to make advanced investment strategies accessible to all. Unlike traditional platforms that demand expertise or intermediary reliance, RCOF is an entirely automated, no-code solution. This user-friendly approach enables individuals, regardless of experience, to utilize sophisticated tools for optimizing investments. The platform’s Robo Advisor delivers personalized investment strategies tailored to individual financial objectives, risk appetites, and market preferences. Similarly, RCO Finance (RCOF) AI-based market insights offer precise market forecasts and automatic portfolio adjustments. Comprehensive Asset Portfolio The platform provides access to over 120,000 assets, including traditional options like stocks, bonds, and ETFs, alongside digital assets such as cryptocurrencies and tokenized real-world investments like real estate and commodities. This extensive range fosters diversification, balancing risk and reward across 12,500 asset classes. Privacy-Focused, KYC-Free Ecosystem The RCOF ecosystem operates a KYC-free ecosystem, prioritizing user anonymity and privacy. Unlike conventional platforms requiring intrusive identity checks, users can seamlessly access DeFi products without undergoing lengthy verification processes. This frictionless onboarding enhances user experience, appealing to privacy-conscious investors. Tokenization of Real-World Assets The platform introduces a groundbreaking feature: the tokenization of real-world assets. By converting physical assets such as real estate and commodities into blockchain-based tokens, the platform simplifies access to markets that have traditionally been difficult to enter. This innovative approach enables fractional ownership, allowing investors to participate in high-value markets without requiring substantial capital. Through tokenization, users can diversify their portfolios with tangible assets, democratizing access to investments once limited to institutional players or wealthy individuals. Dogecoin Price vs. RCO Finance: A Comparative Analysis While the Dogecoin Price movement has made millionaires in the past, it is largely driven by hype and community sentiment. DOGE lost over 11% in 24 hours and 5.9% within a space of two weeks. This underscores the high susceptibility of the memecoin to the crypto market volatility. On the other hand, the RCOF platform’s unique value proposition, which uses AI-powered tools, tokenizes real-world assets, and has a KYC-free ecosystem, makes it a more stable and sustainable investment option. The platform’s focus on democratizing access to sophisticated investment strategies sets it apart from the speculative nature of the Dogecoin Price. RCO Finance Presale: A 30,000x ROI Opportunity The ongoing RCOF token presale is offering a unique opportunity for early investors. Currently priced at $0.077 in Stage 4, top market experts project a 30,000x rally for this revolutionary token. With this projection, market analysts predict that your $1000 investment in the presale would yield over $298,460. Join the presale to capitalize on this life-changing opportunity and secure massive gains. As the project gains momentum in the market, further growth appears highly likely, making this token presale even more attractive. The token presale has already raised over $11 million, with 83.72% of Stage 4 tokens sold. This traction highlights the strong demand for the AI altcoin and RCOF and the increasing investor confidence in the project. For those aiming to maximize returns, this is the ideal lifetime opportunity. SolidProof , a top blockchain security company, audited the project’s smart contract and found zero vulnerabilities.

SEC to Hold First Closed Meeting with Acting Chair Mark Uyeda appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will hold its first closed meeting since Mark Uyeda took over as acting chair. The meeting, scheduled for Thursday, will involve commissioners, the counsel to the commissioners, the commission’s secretary, and recording secretaries. The topics on the agenda include the institution and settlement of injunctive actions, administrative proceedings, litigation claims resolution, and other matters related to examinations and enforcement. This meeting comes shortly after Judge Torres’s recent decision in the case involving the SEC and Ripple. The court ruled that certain distributions of XRP do not count as securities since there was no investment of money involved. Despite this ruling, the SEC has filed an appeal, arguing that the court made errors in its decision, particularly regarding XRP’s classification when sold on digital asset exchanges. Industry Experts Weigh In Industry experts, including John Deaton, are calling for the case to be dismissed, especially in light of the shifting political landscape. Some suggest that a settlement between Ripple and the SEC is possible, which could clarify certain issues while leaving others unresolved. As the crypto industry continues to grow, public and private sector pressure may influence the SEC’s approach to enforcement-driven regulation. Metalawman recently said that it is likely the SEC will soon release the Inspector General’s report regarding Bill Hinman’s conflicts of interest. He expressed confidence that there is no reason for this act of transparency to be delayed until Paul Atkins’ arrival. Reacting to the same, Deaton said, “Releasing the IG report is an important and necessary step moving forward. If the people in charge don’t support releasing the report then they’re arguably no better than the ones before them.”",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|ALTCOIN|XRP|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-22 05:50:32

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. WhiteBIT TR partners with Misyon Bank to expand cryptocurrency access for European investors amid Turkey’s evolving crypto landscape. WhiteBIT TR cryptocurrency exchange has announced a strategic partnership with Turkish neobank Misyon Bank. The firms have revealed that the goal of this collaboration is to enable Misyon Bank to connect with individual investors across Europe through WhiteBIT TR. According to the terms of the agreement between MisyonTech, the financial technology and digital asset subsidiary of Misyon Bank, and WhiteBIT TR, the latter will provide liquidity for major cryptocurrencies, including BTC, ETH, USDC, USDT, and AVAX, on Turkey’s first bank-secured crypto asset platform. Over the years, Turkey has emerged as a regional leader in the cryptocurrency space. According to insights from Kaiko published last year, over half of the country’s population has invested in crypto. The research firm assigns the increased adoption of crypto assets to macroeconomic factors like rising inflation, devaluation of the country’s currency, and a large population of young, unbanked citizens. In a nod to this growing investment in the crypto sector, the Turkish parliament approved a new crypto legislation in July of last year. This legislation is expected to pull Turkey out of the FATF’s ‘gray list’ of countries with insufficient anti-money laundering measures. It’s also interesting to note that Turkey’s inflationary economic situation has markedly increased the use of stablecoins in the country. According to Kaiko’s research, by July 2024, USDT-TRY was the largest trading pair by volume on Binance, with more than $22 billion. Notably, the meme coin trading volume overshadowed that of Bitcoin in Turkey in 2024. Capitalizing on Turkey’s growing enthusiasm for crypto, several companies have launched exciting new initiatives. The WhiteBIT TR-Misyon partnership can be considered as one such move. At the signing of the partnership, Emre Yetişkin, Chairman of the Board of WhiteBIT TR, praised the progress Misyon Bank made as a pioneer in Turkey’s digital asset space. Meanwhile, Muhammet Cerit, CEO of MisyonTech, stated that WhiteBIT TR, which has been serving Turkish users since 2022, is one of the exchanges that knows the country and its market, standing out in Turkey with its speed and security features. “The agreement we signed today with WhiteBIT TR is the first stage of our goal to reach individual investors in Europe,” said Muhammet Cerit. The leaders of both firms also believe that the new regulations on digital assets in their country have strengthened Turkey’s position as a regional investment hub.

This surge comes amid developments of fresh TRUMP ETF filings with the US SEC on Tuesday. Interestingly, Donald Trump has commented on his meme coin frenzy, which led to strong volatility for the Solana meme coin. TRUMP Price Breakout Sets $54 Target Crypto analyst Ali Martinez reported that TRUMP token has successfully broken out of a falling wedge pattern, a bullish technical indicator. According to Martinez, the token’s breakout positions it for a potential surge, with a TRUMP price target of $54. Source: Ali Charts According to Coinglass data , the TRUMP futures open interest is up 14%, shooting past $1.0 billion, indicating bullish sentiment among traders. Also, the 24-hour liquidations have shot to $24 million, of which $14 million is in short liquidations. Additionally, blockchain analytics firm Santiment reported that TRUMP is still the top trending crypto coin discussed among investors, following its contentious listing on Coinbase. In addition to its market activity, TRUMP has drawn significant attention due to its airdrop events. A recent airdrop distributed $1 million worth of TRUMP tokens, fueling heightened interest and engagement from the crypto community. TRUMP Price Surge Amid ETF Filings Another reason behind the TRUMP price surge today is the recent ETF filings for the newly launched meme coin. On Tuesday, REX Financial and Osprey Funds submitted their filings to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a potential TRUMP ETF. Interestingly, this filing comes just three days after the launch of the Official Trump (TRUMP) meme coin. It also outlines REX-Osprey’s plans to introduce a range of crypto-focused funds. In addition to TRUMP ETF, Rex also submitted ETF filings for other meme coins like Dogecoin and BONK. Donald Trump Comments Stir Volatility When asked about the TRUMP meme coin launch during yesterday’s press briefing to reports, the President said: “I don’t know much about it other than I launched it. I heard it was very successful. I haven’t checked.” During a press briefing, a reporter noted that the TRUMP price surge generated several billion dollars in the past few days. In response, the president quipped, “Several billion? That’s peanuts for these guys,” gesturing toward SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son, OpenAI’s Sam Altman, and Oracle’s Larry Ellison, who were present in the room. Meanwhile, Donald Trump’s comments instantly triggered sharp volatility in the meme coin. Soon after the US President made his comments at 6:00 PM ET, three minutes later, the TRUMP coin experienced a sharp 33% drop in value. Buy-The-Dip Strategy Fuels Discussions Notably, a wallet seized the opportunity, purchasing $5.09 million worth of the token at the exact bottom of the dip. This transaction marks one of the largest single purchases since the coin’s launch, reported The Kobeissi Letter. The market quickly rebounded, and within 14 minutes, the trader’s investment had already gained $2.4 million in value. The timing of the purchase has raised doubts about whether it’s an insider job.

While Dogecoin, Solana, and XRP have stolen headlines, a new crypto is quietly building momentum, poised to deliver gains that could eclipse them all in 2025. Could this be the stealth investment opportunity the crypto world has been waiting for? Let’s find out. Introducing Rollblock: The new crypto turning online casinos into a 50x investment opportunity They say a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity doesn’t come around often, but what if the next big crypto is about to surprise us all? Meet Rollblock , the GambleFi protocol reshaping online casinos. Armed with a glut of exciting features, Rollblock seeks to combine the strengths of both decentralized and centralized gaming, giving users the best of both worlds. With over $8.9 million raised and 55 million tokens sold in its 9th presale stage , Rollblock isn’t just betting on growth—it’s stacking the odds in its favor. This new crypto also offers staking rewards and future utility potential, like partnerships with other platforms. Imagine a coin that earns while you play—a digital jackpot in the making. This could really be the token that outpaces Dogecoin, Solana, and XRP. Is Solana pacing itself for a record-breaking 2025? Over the past month, Solana (SOL) has shown some bold price moves, with highs around $219 and a mid-month cooldown near $196. It’s like watching a seasoned sprinter pace themselves for the marathon ahead—SOL knows the game isn’t just about short bursts. And while it’s an impressive contender, one wonders if a new crypto like Rollblock could outpace even SOL’s marathon gains in 2025. Dogecoin holders play the long game: is $0.48 within reach? Dogecoin is growing from its meme days into something more serious. Instead of buying and selling quickly, more short-term holders are now holding onto their DOGE for much longer. This change means fewer people are selling all at once, which can help keep the price steady and even push it higher. On top of that, there’s a lot of interest in Dogecoin for long-term trades, as shown by something called a positive funding rate (basically, more people want to buy than sell). If these holders keep holding, DOGE could rise to $0.48. XRP’s surge in trader interest signals big potential, but caution remains XRP has been showing a lot of interest from traders, with $1.6 billion added recently, showing they expect its price to rise. More people are betting on XRP’s growth, which is why they’re getting involved in large amounts. XRP’s price had been stuck between $2.18 and $2.73, but it finally broke through the $3 barrier. Now all eyes are on topping its ATH. Much like Rollblock’s rise, both have people excited for what’s next, showing how investors are always looking for the next big opportunity. Conclusion Rollblock has been the crypto world’s best-kept secret—until now. With its fresh take on online casinos and a solid presale performance, this coin might just outperform the big names like Dogecoin, Solana, and XRP. With features like staking rewards and token buybacks, it’s stacking the odds in its favor. This could be the crypto surprise you’ve been waiting for!

Trump met with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, and Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison at the White House to announce the company. The President also said Stargate will be the “largest AI infrastructure project in history.” SoftBank plans to pour $500 billion into Stargate Announcing The Stargate Project The Stargate Project is a new company which intends to invest $500 billion over the next four years building new AI infrastructure for OpenAI in the United States. We will begin deploying $100 billion immediately. This infrastructure will secure… — OpenAI (@OpenAI) January 21, 2025 Trump announced that OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle will create Stargate to grow artificial intelligence infrastructure in the United States. The firms also said they will begin with an initial $100 billion investment into Stargate and plan to invest up to $500 billion in the coming years. Trump also acknowledged that the project is expected to create 100,000 jobs in the U.S. The president highlighted that Stargate would build the physical and virtual infrastructure to power the next generation of AI, including data centers nationwide. Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison also revealed that the group’s first 1 million-square-foot data project was already under construction in Texas. “Infrastructure in the United States is super important, AI…requires massive amounts of infrastructure, power, computer chips, data centers, and we need to build that here and we need to be able to have the best AI infrastructure in the world to be able to lead with the technology.” – Sam Altman , CEO of OpenAI. Leaders from AI companies have been advocating for months for more data centers to power their artificial intelligence ambitions in the coming years. Altman said that he believes Stargate will be the “most important project” in this era. He also maintained that the companies would not have been able to bring Stargate to fruition without Trump. OpenAI’s CEO had previously urged U.S. officials to help in the infrastructure buildout to ensure the country remained ahead of China in the AI arms race. Altman argued that AI was poised to impact everything from the economy to military capabilities in the coming years. He also met with Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son last year to solicit investment in new semiconductor plants for building AI chips. Altman also said last month that he believes Trump will “be very good at” attracting AI infrastructure investments to the United States and that he was looking forward to working with Trump’s administration on such investments. Altman hopes Stargate will secure American leadership in AI OpenAI published a policy white paper last week revealing that investment in the U.S. AI infrastructure can ensure that U.S. AI tools win over Chinese technology. The report also highlighted that investment in U.S. AI infrastructure will create new jobs and economic opportunities. OpenAI also urged the U.S. government to create a foundational strategy to ensure that investment in infrastructure benefits Americans and maximizes access to AI. The AI company also estimated that it had $175 billion in global funds awaiting investment in AI projects. The firm argued that if the U.S. did not attract those funds, they would flow to China-backed projects, strengthening the Chinese Communist Party’s global influence. Oracle also acknowledged that the Stargate project will secure American leadership in AI. The firm added that the project will create hundreds of thousands of American jobs and generate massive economic benefits for the entire world. According to Oracle, Stargate will not only support the re-industrialization of the U.S. but also provide a strategic capability to protect the national security of America and its allies. OpenAI said SoftBank will have financial responsibility for the project, and Son will be Stargate’s chairman. The firm also said it will have operational responsibility for the project. According to OpenAI, a fourth partner, MGX, will also contribute funding to Stargate. The President also reversed former president Joe Biden’s executive order that aimed to monitor and regulate AI risks.

This timeline may bring hope to crypto investors and businesses alike, but challenges remain, including political disagreements and unexpected distractions like the TRUMP memecoin. Why Crypto Regulations Are Crucial? A note from TD Cowen’s Washington Research Group, led by Jaret Seiberg, highlighted the importance of bipartisan support in advancing the crypto market structure bill. The absence of clear regulations has limited the growth of the crypto market in the U.S. Without legal certainty, potential investors remain hesitant, and businesses face operational uncertainties. Such legislation is crucial for resolving regulatory gray areas, which have slowed the growth of the crypto sector. Seiberg’s team notes that political divides could delay these critical advancements. Impact of the TRUMP Memecoin One unexpected factor affecting crypto legislation is the launch of the TRUMP memecoin, a cryptocurrency introduced by former President Donald Trump. The token launched days before his inauguration, saw an initial market capitalization of over $14 billion before losing nearly half its value. It now trades at around $42 with a market cap of $8 billion. TD Cowen’s analysts warned that the launch of TRUMP could worsen partisan disagreements, further delaying progress on crypto legislation. Democrats are expected to investigate the token’s price movements and whether it was used by foreign entities to gain influence. Republicans, on the other hand, are likely to defend Trump, making it harder to build the bipartisan cooperation needed to pass the bill. Reputational Risks for the Crypto Industry Critics from both the crypto industry and the policy community have expressed concerns about the TRUMP memecoin. Many believe it distracts from the industry’s broader goals and adds reputational risks. However, Jaret Seiberg’s team at TD Cowen notes that bipartisan cooperation is crucial for passing crypto legislation.",News,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|BUSINESS|FIAT|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-22 05:59:19

Many crypto enthusiasts see this as an indicator of the meme coin trend having its best days behind it. Increasingly, investors are eying up projects with clear value propositions rather than a funny picture with playful branding. One standout in 2025 is Remittix, a powerful PayFi project currently gaining massive traction in its presale, which has yielded over $4.6 million in investments in record time. So could this be the end for meme coins or might Shiba Inu and Dogecoin bounce back? So, what’s capturing all the attention around Remittix? Shiba Inu Losing Its Uniqueness Shiba Inu (SHIB) is inarguably one of the great pioneers of the meme coin space, though things have been looking bleak lately, with price dips across the board. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is now trading at $0.00002122. So what is contributing to this downfall? Well Shiba Inu (SHIB), is likely feeling the weight of an oversaturated market. With countless meme-inspired coins emerging, Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) unique charm seems to be losing its edge. Despite efforts to expand its ecosystem with Shibarium Layer-2, NFTs and gaming initiatives, the broader market sentiment seems to be changing. One thing that Shiba Inu does have going for it is that it has a very loyal holderbase. On-chain analytics suggest that over 74% of holders are long-term holders, while only 21.85% are cruisers, which is significantly lower than the ratio for most meme coins. Dogecoin (DOGE) Clings On, Posting Small Gains Despite the wider meme coin downturn, Dogecoin (DOGE) is holding on surprisingly well, having even posted over a 6% gain in the last week and a net 20% increase over the last month. Dogecoin (DOGE) is still battling market saturation though, in line with other meme coins. Dogecoin’s price has struggled to maintain the momentum it had in 2024, despite occasional Elon Musk endorsements. Dogecoin (DOGE) remains vulnerable in a highly competitive market as newer projects promising deep utility threaten to overshadow meme coins entirely. Remittix Sets a New Standard in PayFi While meme coins falter, a growing number of investors are gravitating toward projects offering tangible, real-world applications. Remittix (RTX) is capturing attention with its focus on transforming cross-border payments, a market valued at $190 trillion. By bridging cryptocurrencies and fiat systems, Remittix (RTX) is addressing inefficiencies in traditional financial systems. The platform enables users to convert over 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat and transfer funds globally, free from hidden fees or delays. Businesses benefit from the Remittix Pay API, which simplifies the integration of crypto payments while offering fiat settlement options. With support for more than 50 cryptocurrency pairs and 30 fiat currencies, the platform streamlines international transactions and reduces costs. The multi-currency wallet on Remittix (RTX) also lets users manage fiat and crypto assets from one account. This is a welcome tool for freelancers and global businesses that process international payments in multiple currencies. Investors Race To Secure Their Share Of RTX The resilient native token, RTX, is priced at $0.0256 during its presale with more than $4.6 million raised so far. This fast-moving presale reflects a strong investor appetite for the Remittix (RTX) value proposition and analysts expect an 800% price surge by the presale close and a 5,000% rally after launch. For investors looking for an application focused project with high growth potential, Remittix is a standout. Positioned to disrupt the cross-border payments market, this project is shaping up to lead the PayFi space in 2025.

Circle’s acquisition of Hashnote, the issuer of the popular tokenized money fund US Yield Coin (USYC), and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong’s predictions on stricter US stablecoin regulations bring attention to a pivotal moment for the industry. Both moves show the growing importance of compliance, transparency, and innovation in integrating stablecoins and tokenized assets into mainstream finance. Coinbase CEO Predicts Stricter Stablecoin Regulations: Implications for the Market and Offshore Players Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has made a bold prediction regarding the future of stablecoin regulation in the United States, suggesting that issuers may soon be required to fully back their dollar-pegged tokens with US Treasury bills. This move, he believes, could create significant challenges for offshore stablecoin providers operating in the American market. Armstrong shared his thoughts during an interview with The Wall Street Journal at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, signaling a transformative period for the cryptocurrency industry. According to Armstrong, impending stablecoin legislation in the United States is likely to demand stricter compliance measures. These may include backing stablecoins entirely with US Treasury bonds and undergoing periodic audits. Such requirements aim to ensure greater transparency and security in the stablecoin sector, reinforcing trust among users and regulators alike. While these changes could bolster the legitimacy of stablecoins, they also present significant hurdles for issuers that fail to meet the stringent criteria. Armstrong specifically called out Tether (USDT), one of the most widely used stablecoins, as potentially vulnerable to the new regulatory framework. He noted that Coinbase might delist USDT in the US market if Tether cannot comply with forthcoming legislation. “There are a lot of people with Tether, and we want to give them an off-ramp if we want to help them transition to a system that we think is more secure,” Armstrong stated. Despite these concerns, Coinbase intends to continue offering USDT services in the interim to facilitate customer access to other cryptocurrency assets. Coinbase’s approach to stablecoin compliance is already evident in its European operations. In anticipation of the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), the exchange delisted USDT and other stablecoins that fell short of the regulatory requirements. A Coinbase spokesperson clarified that the company remains open to relisting such stablecoins should they achieve MiCA compliance in the future. This proactive stance is part of Coinbase’s commitment to aligning its operations with global regulatory standards, potentially setting an industry benchmark for other exchanges. The global stablecoin market, valued at approximately $218.7 billion, has become a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency industry. With the top five stablecoins accounting for 92% of the market share, any regulatory changes are likely to have a far-reaching impact. Stablecoins have gained prominence for their utility in facilitating seamless transactions and acting as a bridge between traditional finance and digital assets. However, their rapid growth has also attracted heightened scrutiny from regulators, who are keen to address potential risks related to financial stability and consumer protection. US Stablecoin Legislation: A Top Priority for Lawmakers In the United States, stablecoin regulation has emerged as a critical area of focus for policymakers. Republican Representative Tom Emmer, vice chairman of the House Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology, and Artificial Intelligence, has identified stablecoin legislation as Congress’ top priority in the crypto space. “Passing comprehensive market structure and stablecoin legislation” is seen as essential to cementing the US dollar’s position as the global reserve currency. The Payment Stablecoin Act, proposed by Senators Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand, is a key legislative effort in this regard. Introduced in April 2024, the act aims to establish a clear regulatory framework for stablecoins while reinforcing the dollar’s dominance in global finance. The proposed changes to US stablecoin regulations present both challenges and opportunities for the industry. For issuers like Tether, compliance with stricter requirements could necessitate significant operational changes, potentially reshaping the competitive landscape. Offshore companies may find it increasingly difficult to serve the US market, opening the door for domestic players to solidify their positions. For Coinbase and other exchanges, the evolving regulatory environment offers an opportunity to strengthen their market presence by demonstrating compliance and fostering consumer trust. By proactively addressing regulatory concerns, Coinbase is positioning itself as a leader in the push for a more secure and transparent cryptocurrency ecosystem. As US lawmakers prepare to roll out comprehensive stablecoin regulations, the industry faces a pivotal moment. The decisions made in the coming months will not only shape the future of stablecoins but also influence the broader cryptocurrency landscape. For Armstrong and Coinbase, the focus remains on navigating these changes while supporting customers in transitioning to compliant and secure systems. With a market valued in the hundreds of billions and the stakes higher than ever, the stablecoin sector stands at the forefront of crypto innovation and regulation. Whether the new rules will foster growth or stifle innovation remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: the eyes of the world are on stablecoins, and the next chapter in their evolution is about to be written. Circle Acquires Hashnote, Strengthening Its Position in Tokenized Real-World Asset Market In related news, Stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Financial has taken a significant step in expanding its influence in the tokenized asset space by acquiring Hashnote, the issuer of the tokenized real-world asset (RWA) fund known as US Yield Coin (USYC). This strategic acquisition positions Circle to further capitalize on the rapidly growing market for tokenized money funds and real-world assets. In a Jan. 21 announcement, Circle highlighted the transformative potential of the acquisition. The integration of Hashnote and its flagship token USYC is expected to make USYC a “preferred form of yield-bearing collateral” across crypto exchanges, custodians, and prime brokers. US Yield Coin, or USYC, is currently the most popular tokenized money fund by market capitalization, with a total value locked (TVL) of approximately $1.25 billion, according to data from RWA.xyz . Circle’s announcement emphasized that USYC's strong position in the market would complement its own USD Coin (USDC) ecosystem, creating synergies between tokenized money market fund (TMMF) collateral and stablecoin liquidity. As part of the acquisition, Circle has entered into a partnership with DRW, one of the largest institutional crypto trading firms. This collaboration will expand DRW’s institutional-grade liquidity and settlement services in both USDC and USYC, enabling more efficient collateral management across platforms. Circle’s announcement further detailed plans to fully integrate USYC with USDC. The move aims to provide seamless access between tokenized collateral like USYC and Circle’s widely adopted stablecoin, USDC. This integration is expected to streamline financial operations for institutional users, providing enhanced liquidity, security, and ease of use. The acquisition comes at a time when demand for tokenized real-world assets is skyrocketing. These assets, represented as digital tokens, offer claims on tangible items such as US Treasury bonds, money market funds, and even artworks. According to Colin Butler, Polygon’s global head of institutional capital, tokenized RWAs represent a $30-trillion market opportunity globally. Tokenized money market funds, in particular, have seen significant interest due to their backing by highly liquid, yield-bearing assets like US Treasury bills. Hashnote’s USYC faces competition from other significant players, including the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) and the Franklin OnChain US Government Money Fund (FOBXX), which boast TVLs of $630 million and $525 million, respectively. Circle’s USD Coin (USDC) remains the second-largest stablecoin in the cryptocurrency market, with a market capitalization of approximately $48 billion. Despite trailing Tether’s USDt, which has a market cap of around $138 billion, USDC has been steadily gaining market share, particularly since December. Concerns over Tether’s compliance with the European Union’s MiCA have bolstered confidence in USDC as a compliant and transparent alternative. This growing confidence aligns with Circle’s focus on regulatory compliance and operational transparency, making it an attractive choice for institutional and retail users alike. The integration of Hashnote’s USYC is expected to further strengthen Circle’s competitive position in the stablecoin and tokenized asset sectors. The Promise and Risks of T-Bill Tokenization The tokenization of US Treasury bills (T-bills) and other real-world assets has been touted as a game-changer for financial markets. The US Treasury Department, in an October report, acknowledged the potential of T-bill tokenization to drive operational improvements and innovation. However, it also warned of potential risks to financial stability, highlighting the need for robust regulatory oversight. Circle’s acquisition of Hashnote and its strategic alignment with institutional players like DRW show the company’s commitment to navigating these challenges while unlocking new opportunities in the tokenized asset market. The acquisition of Hashnote marks a pivotal moment for Circle as it expands its reach in the tokenized real-world asset sector. By integrating USYC into its ecosystem and partnering with institutional leaders, Circle aims to redefine the landscape of tokenized collateral and stablecoins. As the market for tokenized assets continues to grow, Circle’s strategic moves could solidify its position as a leader in this space, offering innovative solutions that bridge the gap between traditional finance and blockchain technology. However, with increased scrutiny from regulators and intensifying competition, the road ahead is as challenging as it is promising.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|EXCHANGE|USDT|USDC,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-22 06:00:00

Trump’s World Liberty Financial Propels LINK Price Up In a series of rapid transactions completed within just 15 minutes, World Liberty Financial purchased 220,000 LINK tokens, totaling an impressive $5.63 million, according to Chinese reporter Wu Blockchain. This strategic move was accompanied by additional acquisitions, including 13,000 Aave (AAVE) tokens valued at $4.41 million and 37.267 million TRON (TRX) tokens worth $8.86 million. Related Reading: World Liberty Financial Raises $1B: Trump-Backed Crypto Venture To Extend Token Sales The buying pressure generated by these transactions contributed to a notable 44% uptrend in LINK’s price over a two-week period, with a more immediate increase of over 11% within just 24 hours. But despite this bullish momentum, LINK’s price remains approximately 49% below its all-time high of $52.70, achieved during the 2021 bull run as it is currently hovering little over above the $26 mark. In a social media post on X (formerly Twitter), WLFI detailed these acquisitions, stating that they were made to commemorate the inauguration of Donald J. Trump as the 47th President of the United States. The post highlighted additional purchases, including $47 million in Ethereum (ETH), $47 million in wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC), and similar amounts in AAVE, LINK, TRX, and Ethena (ENA). How Chainlink Could Double In Value The involvement of the Trump family in the crypto space has sparked excitement among bullish LINK investors, fostering renewed confidence in the token’s prospects. Analysts like Michael van de Poppe have weighed in, noting that LINK has recently experienced a standard 30% correction—a pattern seen more than 15 times in previous cycles. Despite this, van de Poppe anticipates an upward price movement for Chainlink toward the $35 mark as market conditions stabilize. Adding to the positive sentiment, market expert Ali Martinez reported a significant withdrawal of over 770,000 LINK tokens from crypto exchanges on Tuesday, suggesting that investors are increasingly confident in LINK’s potential and a possible continuation of the uptrend observed over the past month. Related Reading: Is It Time To Give Up On Ethereum Below $4,000? Analyst Weighs The Facts Satoshi Flipper also chimed in on LINK’s price action, expressing optimism about the token’s adoption and future performance. He noted the emergence of a falling wedge pattern that could propel LINK toward its all-time high, suggesting that a price doubling from current levels is feasible. Flipper emphasized the importance of Chainlink in the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem, arguing that dismissing the potential for further gains before reaching new highs would be a mistake. Interestingly, Aixbt recently pointed out that LINK’s monthly Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 67, approaching the critical 70 level that previously triggered a dramatic 375% price surge. This setup mirrors the conditions that drove the price from $3.50 to $20 in an earlier cycle. If history were to repeat itself, such a surge could push LINK toward the $124.80 mark, nearly tripling its current peak.

Trump continued to add that “the scum that worked to convict him were some of the same lunatics who were involved in the modern-day weaponization of government against me. He was given two life sentences, plus 40 years. Ridiculous!” Ross Ulbricht has been freed by President Trump with a full pardon! Thank you for keeping your word to me and others who have been advocating for Ross’ freedom, Mr. President! #freeRoss pic.twitter.com/wOJVFX1DaA — Thomas Massie (@RepThomasMassie) January 22, 2025 Ross Ulbricht Finally Free The Silk Road founder was serving a life sentence after being convicted of running an underground online marketplace that was used by drug dealers to conduct illicit sales using Bitcoin. Ulbricht created and operated Silk Road, one of the first modern darknet markets, from 2011 until his arrest in 2013. The site worked on the Tor network and used crypto for transactions, allowing users to buy and sell goods anonymously. Ulbricht, who used the pseudonym “Dread Pirate Roberts” (DPR), was an ardent libertarian who believed in free market principles and opposed drug prohibition laws. He was convicted in May 2015 on seven charges, including distributing narcotics, computer hacking, conspiracy, and money laundering. He received two life sentences plus 40 years without the possibility of parole. “I wanted to empower people to make choices in their lives and have privacy and anonymity,” Ulbricht said at his sentencing hearing. Supporters have long advocated for clemency, arguing his sentence was disproportionately harsh and that Silk Road reduced violence in the drug trade by moving it online. Waiting on Crypto EOs Trump had announced plans to commute Ulbricht’s sentence in May during a speech at the Libertarian National Convention. “Thanks to President Trump for keeping his word to end Ross’s unjust sentence by granting him a full and unconditional pardon. Prayers have been answered for Ross, Lyn (his mother), and all their family and friends. So happy for them!” commented former Congressman Justin Amash.

Crypto journalist Zack Guzman called the appointment “insanely bullish” for the industry, noting that Peirce had previously outlined three key predictions about the future of a pro-crypto SEC, and that those predictions are increasingly likely to come true. One of Peirce’s main criticisms of the SEC has been its reliance on enforcement actions as a regulatory tool. Under his leadership, a newly formed crypto task force aims to create a comprehensive and transparent framework for compliance. “Today’s announcement to establish a task force to finally establish clear rules confirms the ‘day one’ changes he envisioned,” Guzman said. The move away from retroactive sanctions marks a potential turning point for the industry by offering a roadmap for compliance instead of vague guidelines. Related News: Are Big Market Cap Altcoins or Small Market Cap Altcoins Better for a Portfolio? Analytics Company Shares Its Strategy Peirce has long advocated an approach that fosters innovation while protecting investors. He envisions a regulatory environment where developers and founders can create new technologies without constant fear of sanctions. Peirce Predicted Staking Could Be Allowed in Ethereum Spot ETFs in New Administration Perhaps the most significant of Peirce’s predictions involves the SEC potentially approving staking-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which Guzman noted could be one reason why the Ethereum Foundation recently made strategic moves regarding staking. “Peirce predicted that the SEC could possibly move ‘early’ to greenlight staking through ETFs, which would be a huge development,” Guzman said. *This is not investment advice.

The comments come amid calls from the community to promote researcher and developer Danny Ryan, whose contributions to Ethereum’s transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake have been widely praised.

Ryan’s supporters argue that his expertise aligns with Ethereum’s long-term goals, positioning him as a strong candidate for leadership despite Buterin’s firm stance on maintaining control over Foundation decisions. Meanwhile, Miyaguchi, who has held this role since 2018, has faced criticism from community members on X, with some blaming her for inefficiencies within the Foundation. Recently, well-followed crypto trader CoinMamba, a vocal critic of the Ethereum Foundation, called for the resignation of Miyaguchi. We got some momentum here. With @AyaMiyagotchi resigning $ETH can reach ATH in 2 weeks. — CoinMamba (@coinmamba) January 19, 2025 CoinMamba urged the community to maintain pressure on the Foundation, reasoning that such efforts could lead to her stepping down, which could positively impact Ethereum’s trajectory. In response, Buterin firmly dismissed the idea, stating that he is solely responsible for deciding the Ethereum Foundation’s leadership team. He lashed back against the community’s recent attacks and criticized community members for creating a toxic environment for Ethereum’s “top talent.” “YOU ARE MAKING MY JOB HARDER. And you are decreasing the chance I have any interest whatsoever in doing “what you want,” he added.

Some community members were quick to criticize this, with market commentator abstractXBT raising concerns over the centralized nature of this stanch. Instead, they suggested that the foundation should focus more on practical solutions, such as increasing developer support through hackathons and grants, rather than engaging in philosophical debates over leadership. The person deciding the new EF leadership team is me. The future of the world computer is centralized???

He pointed out that the EF is “only one part” of the broader ecosystem and suggested focusing on reforming other organizations like Consensys, which could take on more responsibilities. He added: “EF should not “midcurve”, it should confidently represent the aspects of Ethereum that it can be effective at representing and deliberately create and nurture open space for other orgs to represent the other aspects of Ethereum.” As previously reported by crypto.news, the Ethereum Foundation has also faced criticism regarding its financial practices, particularly concerning the management of its ETH holdings. Community members have expressed concerns over the Foundation’s periodic sales of ETH, questioning why it opts to liquidate assets instead of leveraging staking opportunities.

Market sentiment was further dampened by caution ahead of China’s Lunar New Year holiday, as well as upcoming interest rate decisions from the Bank of Japan and the US Federal Reserve. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 1.78% to surpass 39,500, while the broader Topix Index gained 0.7% to 2,732 on Wednesday, reaching their highest levels in nearly two weeks. The Japanese yen steadied around 155.6 per dollar on Wednesday, pausing its recent rally which was fueled by expectations that the Bank of Japan would raise interest rates this week following hawkish remarks from central bank officials. China ( SHCOMP ) fell 0.98% to around 3,210 while the Shenzhen Component tumbled 1.1% to 10,185 on Wednesday, after US President Donald Trump said his team was discussing a 10% tariff on goods imported from China that could take effect as early as Feb. 1. The offshore yuan depreciated past 7.28 per dollar, extending its losses from the previous session. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 1.55% to 19,787 in early trade on Wednesday, ending gains in the prior six sessions. India ( SENSEX ) rose 0.40% to 76,176 in morning trade on Wednesday, as traders took profits after hitting a more than seven-month low in the prior session. Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.33% to close at 8,430 on Wednesday, hitting its highest level in nearly seven weeks during the session. The Westpac-Melbourne Institute Leading Economic Index in Australia remained unchanged month-over-month in December 2024, following a 0.1% rise in the previous month. In the U.S., on Tuesday, all three major indexes ended higher with the S&P 500 adding 0.9%, the Nasdaq gaining 0.6%, and the Dow jumping 538 points, supported by relief over President Trump’s unexpectedly softer trade measures after his first day in office.

Arbitrum Has Been Trading Inside A Descending Triangle Recently In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a Descending Triangle pattern forming in the 4-hour price of Arbitrum. The “Descending Triangle” refers to a formation from technical analysis (TA) that, as its name suggests, looks like a triangle slopped downwards. The pattern involves two trendlines between which the asset consolidates: an upper level drawn by connecting together lower highs in the price and a lower one parallel to the time-axis that joins bottoms. Like in many other TA patterns, the upper line is considered to be a point of probable resistance for the price, while the lower one can act as support. Related Reading: Trader Greed Strikes Again: Bitcoin Corrects To $102,000 After FOMO Spike Breaks out of either of these lines can imply a continuation of trend in that direction. An escape above the triangle is naturally a bullish signal, while a drop under it can foreshadow a bearish outcome. Similar to the Descending Triangle, there is also another pattern called the Ascending Triangle, which forms when the consolidation occurs towards an overall upside. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the Descending Triangle that the 4-hour price of Arbitrum has been trading inside during the last couple of months: As displayed in the above graph, the Arbitrum 4-hour price retested the upper level of the Descending Triangle a few days ago, but it found rejection as it has since plunged down. Yesterday, the coin saw a very brief retest of the lower line, but it appears this level is also holding for the cryptocurrency as its price has found a rebound from it. Related Reading: XRP Whale Binance Deposits Skyrocket: Key Holders Preparing For Profit-Taking? It’s likely that these levels won’t hold for long, however, as ARB is fast approaching the apex of the triangle. As the range gets narrower, the chances of a breakout (in either direction) become higher. At present, Arbitrum is trading right in the middle of the two levels, so it’s uncertain which one it would be traveling to next. Martinez notes that if the breakout happens towards the upside, then the cryptocurrency could end up enjoying a surge of around 46%. This figure is based on the fact that the height of the triangle involves a price swing of this percentage. It only remains to be seen whether ARB would be able to find a break above the Descending Triangle or not. ARB Price At the time of writing, Arbitrum is trading around $0.72, up 1% over the last 24 hours.

With the advent of more DeFi protocols, everyday money-spenders and more financial enthusiasts across different markets will soon start to flood the blockchain network, taking digital money to the next level. However, this starts with the emergence of DeFi projects that are fully focused on enhancing security, speed, interoperability, and overall user convenience. This is the exact goal Elluminex (ELX) is chasing, and it’s leveraging one of the fastest and most modern blockchain networks, TON, to achieve this feat. The DeFi market has already been forecasted to reach $231.19 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 42.5%. Considering the unparalleled scalability and user base that TON blockchain has to offer, Elluminex is well-placed to capture a substantial share of this expanding market. Keep on reading to find out the potential embedded in this new entrant. Elluminex Is An All-In-One DeFi Hub Making Cross-Chain Operability Smooth Than Ever As an all-in-one DeFi platform built to take advantage of the nearly one billion users on the TON blockchain , Elluminex (ELX) is expected to rally significantly. Its smooth and user-friendly multi-chain ecosystem has been designed to not only allow trading, staking, and farming but users can also track crypto assets with AI-powered portfolio trackers. This improves asset management by providing real-time market insights to help investors with smart trading decisions. Typically, Elluminex offers a DEX protocol with high liquidity, minimum slippage, and advanced trading features. Traders who are looking to engage in cross-chain swaps and token offerings can earn their $ELX native token by joining its liquidity farming. Interestingly, token holders have exclusive pre-market access to new tokens on the TON network, meaning they can invest in promising projects before they get listed on exchange platforms. Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of Elluminex multi-chain DEX is its educational hub which was designed to eradicate DeFi illiteracy. This strategic focus on community involvement and user empowerment is primed to set Elluminex up as the next best DEX protocol that not only allows cross-chain trading alone but also empowers its users to learn more about DeFi and take full advantage of the best DeFi opportunities. The Potential Elluminex Has For Delivering Massive Growth On The TON Blockchain One of the most noteworthy features of the Elluminex (ELX) platform is its token burn mechanism. This makes sure that its native token goes through a deflationary cycle that decreases the supply of its token over time, thereby causing a monumental rise in its value. Beyond this, Elluminex’s potential for continuous growth is tied to its connection to the TON blockchain . As it ventures into the untapped DeFi market on TON, there are speculations that this new entrant could realize a bullish rally when it launches on the mainstream market. Already signaling itself as a solution to major bottlenecks in the decentralization finance sector, Elluminex is primed to outperform the likes of Jupiter, Uniswap, and PancakeSwap to rank as the best exchange platform. Having just started its ICO phase, Elluminex is still regarded as one of the top DeFi projects with a lot of potential to realize. Given the increased market players’ interest that its presale will garner coupled with its token burn mechanism, Elluminex’s native token is primed to reach significant heights as market participants who get in now have a solid chance of reaping immeasurable returns. Is Elluminex Capable Of Becoming The Highest-Growing DeFi Platform In 2025? The possibility of Elluminex ranking as the highest-growing DeFi platform in 2025 is possibly considered its untapped potential in the DeFi market. While it may not rank among the best DeFi platforms, it can potentially surpass all other DeFi protocols when its 2025 gains alone are considered.

While the shor-term performance has been uninspiring, the outlook is likely to change for Ethereum, as suggested by on-chain metrics, whale accumulation data and technical analysis. All these bullish signals suggest that the price could bounce and revisit $4,000 soon. *Ethereum price updated as of No data found for ethereum on 55 minutes ago. Network Activity Spikes: Is New Capital Flowing into ETH? Data from Santiment shows that the Network Growth indicator has spiked to 180K after hovering around 90K for the past three months. This indicator tracks new wallets joining the Ethereum blockchain and suggests that these investors are interested in buying ETH at the current levels. Hence, Network Growth can be interpreted as capital inflow. This metric spiked in May 2024 after Ethereum crashed from $4,000 to $3,100. Shortly thereafter, the price surged 34%. If history rhymes, then investors can expect a bottom formation around the current levels and expect Etheruem price to kickstart a rally. ETH Network Growth Hints New Capital Inflow With such a bullish fundamental development in investor outlook, it is likely that Ethereum price could form a bottom here. Supporting this idea are whales or high-net-worth traders accumulating ETH. Whales on Buying Spree Two metrics suggest why whales, also known as high-net-worth investors, are buying ETH. The first indicator is the supply of ETH held by non-exchange addresses, which has risen from roughly 52 million in March 2024 to 66 million as of January 2025. This accumulation spree occurs while the supply of ETH held on exchanges has dropped drastically in the past two months, from 10.89 million on November 27, 2024, to 10.39 million as of July 22, 2025. A combination of these two events serve as a bullish sign that Ethereum price could be preparing for an impulsive move to the upside. ETH Supply on Exchange vs Supply held by non-exchange address Additionally, supporting accumulation is the supply distribution metric that tracks wallets holding between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH. This cohort has increased its stack by 330,000 ETH in the past two weeks. At the current value of No data found for ethereum on 55 minutes ago, they have accumulated ETH worth roughly $1.08 billion. During a crash in July 2024, these wallets accumulated 620K ETH, which led to a price rally from roughly $2,400 to nearly $4,000 in the next five months. During the recent drop, these same wallets have accumulated 330K ETH, which hints that a potential uptrend could be brewing. Whales Accumulate 300K ETH Worth $1 billion in 2 Weeks Will Ethereum Price Visit $4,000? As noted above, on-chain metrics point to a bullish outlook for ETH and expect prices to rally. Technical analysis shows a falling wedge pattern forming for Ethereum on the four-hour chart. The bullish setup forecasts Ethereum price could rally 17% and tag $4,000. This target is obtained by adding the height of the wedge’s widest part to the breakout point of $3,400. ETH/USDT 4-hour chart With bullish on-chain metrics like increased network activity and whales accumulating $1 billion worth of ETH, the outlook is as bullish as it can get. Investors must pay attention to these key support levels: $3,057 and $3,132. A breakdown of these barriers will spell trouble for ETH and could trigger a 13% to 15% crash to $2,657.

From Dogecoin to Shiba Inu, these coins have gained massive attention, attracting millions of investors. But if you missed out on these early opportunities, it’s not too late to cash in on the next big meme coin. Meet BTFD Coin—a new meme coin that’s capturing the attention of early investors with its massive ROI potential. If you slept on Notcoin’s ICO, now’s the time to secure your place in BTFD Coin’s presale, one of the best new meme coin presales to invest in today , before it’s too late.

Let’s dive into what makes this coin a must-have for any investor looking to secure their place in the meme coin world. BTFD Coin: Presale Performance, Play-to-Earn, and Staking Rewards BTFD Coin is currently in Stage 14 of its presale, and the numbers are impressive. Over $5.4 million has been raised, and more than 8,900 bulls are already on board, holding over 65 billion BTFD coins. The presale price is currently at $0.0001600, but analysts predict the price could reach $0.006 after it hits the market. This presents a massive opportunity for investors looking for high returns. For example, a $3,000 investment at the current price would give you 18,750,000 BTFD coins. If the price reaches $0.006 post-listing, that investment could grow to $112,500—an ROI of 3,650%! This is why BTFD Coin is considered one of the best new meme coin presales to invest in today. BTFD Coin’s Play-to-Earn game , which launched on January 1, 2025, adds an extra layer of excitement.

Moreover, by referring others to join the community, you can earn rewards and help spread the word about BTFD Coin. As more people join the community, the value of the coin could rise, increasing your investment. To buy BTFD Coins, first set up a digital wallet like MetaMask or Trust Wallet and load it with BNB, ETH, or USDT. Then, head to the official BTFD presale page, connect your wallet, and choose how much BTFD you want to buy. After confirming your transaction, your BTFD coins will be added to your wallet, ready for staking or holding until the price increases. Stay updated on your rewards as you grow your investment! Notcoin: A Missed Opportunity Notcoin initially made waves due to its viral Telegram game, which captured the attention of Web3 enthusiasts eager to explore new cryptocurrency projects. The game’s innovative tap-to-earn mechanic quickly drew users into the Notcoin ecosystem, creating a buzz and sparking widespread interest. Many saw Notcoin as the next big thing in the meme coin world, but its ICO has since passed, and the opportunity to invest at its lowest price is no longer available. Despite the hype, Notcoin has already moved past its early days, leaving investors who missed out with a sense of regret. While the coin did gain traction, the opportunity to buy in early has come and gone. If you missed Notcoin’s ICO, don’t miss out on BTFD Coin, which is still in presale and offers another chance to get in at the ground floor.

One of the goals of the ongoing reform is to give the EF a ‘proper board’, but until that happens it’s me,” he said on X. The post came in response to significant backlash against Aya Miyaguchi, the Foundation’s executive director since 2018, with accusations of inefficiencies during her tenure. “If you ‘keep the pressure on,’ then you are creating an environment that is actively toxic to top talent,” Buterin said in response to the social media backlash. No. This is not how this game works. The person deciding the new EF leadership team is me. One of the goals of the ongoing reform is to give the EF a “proper board”, but until that happens it’s me.

However, he emphasized the foundation would not engage in ideological shifts, political lobbying, or take a more central ecosystem role. There is strong community pressure to promote developer Danny Ryan to a leadership position. On Jan. 22, Ryan, who left the EF in 2024 due to health issues, said, “Some of the discourse has turned counterproductive,” before adding: “These are real people attempting to sort through and do what is best. With or without me, the EF is evolving and for the better. You’ve been heard, but vitriol is ultimately harmful to this process.” Just to fill you in: I left the EF last year due to health issues and in an attempt to clear my head after working my ass off exclusively at the EF and on Ethereum for seven years.

Additionally, the dissent and recent EF ETH sales have dampened ETH prices, which have been consolidating for the past month. ETH has gained 2.4% on the day to reach $3,330 at the time of writing, but most of the other altcoins are still outperforming it. The asset failed to follow Bitcoin, XRP, and Solana to existing or new peaks and remains down 32% from its 2021 all-time high. This is all despite US President Donald Trump actively buying ETH and the premise of staked Ethereum ETFs being approved by the SEC soon.

Ethereum could soon outperform Bitcoin. Cryptocurrency analyst explains what the next few months could have in store for Bitcoin. Bitcoin saw a sharp rise followed by a sudden drop after President Trump’s inauguration. His first executive orders made no mention of cryptocurrency or Bitcoin, contrary to expectations from some market watchers. While many had hoped for crypto-friendly policies, Trump’s immediate focus remained on national security and energy reforms. This led some Bitcoin holders to panic-sell, though others believe Bitcoin could still gain recognition as a strategic reserve asset. However, Bitcoin’s dominance still holds strong, and even though the total market cap had some fluctuations, it’s maintaining its position. For now, the signs are still positive for Bitcoin and the broader market, with Ethereum also holding steady.

In addition, the Trump meme coin , which has made headlines following the recent inauguration, experienced a sharp price drop after the lack of crypto-related mentions during the event. Despite this, Trump coin is still holding higher than its launch price, though its future remains uncertain in the short term. Solana and Ethereum are showing signs of bouncing from key support. Ethereum Holds Above Key Support Ethereum has shown mixed price action in recent days, currently holding above the previous swing lows around $3,140, but still below the recent swing highs near $3,450. As the market moves within this range, the outlook remains uncertain, with the potential for further testing of support levels. The analysis suggests that if Ethereum stays above key support around $3,140, there is still room for price continuation. However, the price action remains choppy, and the market could test the support level at $3,334, which represents the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement of the recent price movement. If this level holds, a rebound and further price movement higher could be expected. For a more bullish scenario, the market would need to break above the $3,450 level, which would suggest a move towards higher price levels. If this happens, the next target is the 138% Fibonacci extension at $3,976, followed by potential further gains towards $4,140. However, this forecast remains subject to change, depending on how the market behaves in the coming days. Market Outlook The focus remains on the micro support area, with traders awaiting confirmation of either a continued upward trend or further testing of lower support levels.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/economist-says-xrp-is-preparing-for-another-monstrous-move-heres-why/,"Cryptocurrency analyst Mikybull recently shared a technical analysis of XRP, suggesting the potential for a major price movement. The four-hour chart shows a continuation pattern forming after a sharp bullish breakout, with XRP trading at $3.1999, down 2.16% at the time of the post. Bullish Technical Indicators Suggest Optimism Mikybull’s chart highlights key technical signals that support the possibility of further upward movement. XRP previously broke out of a descending wedge pattern, a well-known bullish reversal structure. Following the breakout, the asset surged significantly, forming a steep ascending trendline. Currently, the price is consolidating within a smaller descending channel, often interpreted as a “bull flag.” This pattern, if confirmed by a breakout above the channel’s resistance, could signal the continuation of the prior uptrend. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 57.12 indicates a neutral-to-bullish momentum. The RSI has not entered overbought territory, suggesting room for further upward movement if buying pressure increases. $XRP preparing for another monstrous move pic.twitter.com/JQfp6rWnBu — Mikybull Crypto (@MikybullCrypto) January 19, 2025 Community Reactions Highlight Mixed Sentiment The post quickly drew attention on social media, sparking mixed reactions from the community. A user named RealCornPop echoed Mikybull’s optimism, stating, “$XRP preparing for another monstrous move.” However, others were more critical. Jon Rambo commented, “Monstrous? Example: Trump coin $60 in 1 day. XRP $3 in 7 years. Market decided already!” This divide reflects broader sentiment in the cryptocurrency space. XRP has a strong base of supporters who believe in its long-term potential. It also faces criticism for its relatively slow growth compared to other cryptocurrencies that have experienced meteoric rises in shorter timeframes. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Key Levels and Market Factors to Watch For XRP to fulfill its bullish potential , the price must break above the bull flag’s resistance. Such a move could pave the way for further gains, possibly toward new local highs. However, failure to break out could result in continued consolidation or retracement, depending on market sentiment. External factors, such as overall cryptocurrency market trends, macroeconomic conditions, and developments in XRP’s utility within the payments sector, will also play a crucial role in determining its price trajectory. While Mikybull’s analysis suggests a promising setup for XRP, market uncertainty remains a key factor.

Here’s How,https://coinpedia.org/news/did-donald-trump-fuel-stargate-finance-stg-tokens-rally-heres-how/,"The post Did Donald Trump Fuel Stargate Finance (STG) Token’s Rally? Here’s How appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As the Donald Trump administration settles down for a thrilling task ahead of making America great again, the altcoin market has gradually gained bullish momentum. Under the Trump administration, the cryptocurrency industry has massively been legalized, especially memecoins and DeFi tokens. Moreover, the previous Joe Biden administration heavily recognized Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) as commodities, while the rest of the digital assets were classified as securities. Consequently, more investors, led by institutional investors, have been preparing to wholly endorse the cryptocurrency industry in the near term as a hedge against inflation. Top DeFi Token to Consider Ahead Following the sustained Bitcoin price close above $100k in the recent past, the Stargate Finance (STG) token has signaled the onset of its macro bullish sentiment. The small-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $378 million and a 24-hour average trading volume, surged over 13 percent to trade about $0.378 on Wednesday, during the mid-London session. From a technical analysis standpoint, STG price, in the daily time frame, has consistently closed above the 50 Moving Average (MA) in the last few months, potentially signaling the buyers are in control. Since November 2024, STG price has formed a rising trend, characterized by higher highs and higher lows. In the long haul, if the STG token consistently closes above 55 cents, the next phase of the macro bull run will be confirmed. Bullish Factors in Stargate Finance Stargate Finance has grown to a major omni-protocol, with over $436 million in total value locked (TVL). The highly liquid STG token, with over 38k on-chain holders, has gained massive utility through the Stargate Farm program, whereby liquidity providers get rewarded. The Stargate Finance protocol has gained significant utility as Ethereum’s layer two scaling solutions attract more mainstream users. Moreover, the Stargate Finance platform enables users to seamlessly transfer assets between different chains securely for a small fee.",News|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-22 07:29:28

Revealed on Jan. 21, the platform aims to strengthen Crypto.com’s presence in the U.S. by offering advanced solutions tailored for institutional trading. It will operate as a complementary service to the existing Crypto.com App, which caters to retail traders in the country. According to Crypto.com co-founder and CEO Kris Marszalek, the launch builds on the company’s significant investments in technological capabilities and banking infrastructure since testing an early version of the exchange in 2022. As part of its offerings, institutional traders on the new platform will have access to over 300 cryptocurrencies and 480 trading pairs alongside advanced trading tools, deep liquidity, and infrastructure designed to support high-frequency and large-volume trading, the announcement stated. Further, the platform introduces advanced order types and sub-account options for active traders, while less frequent traders can leverage built-in trading bots like DCA, GRID, and TWAP for automated strategies.

The platform also supports instant transfers, OTC services, and low-latency trading through API integrations and client-focused programs. Crypto.com’s expansion into the institutional market comes as regulatory developments in the U.S. signal a shift toward greater clarity for the cryptocurrency sector under a pro-crypto administration led by President Donald Trump. Since Trump’s election victory, the company has made moves to strengthen its U.S. presence. In December, Crypto.com expanded its footprint in the U.S. by launching the Crypto.com Custody Trust Company, offering custodial services to institutions and high-net-worth clients across the U.S. This move came just days after Crypto.com Marszalek met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, where they discussed crypto-friendly policies, including a proposed national Bitcoin reserve. Subsequently, Crypto.com also withdrew its lawsuit against the SEC, which had challenged the agency’s jurisdiction over certain digital assets. Earlier this month, the exchange introduced stock and ETF trading on its platform for select U.S. users. Following Trump’s inauguration, the Securities and Exchange Commission, led by Acting Chair Mark Uyeda, has moved quickly to address crypto oversight.

Prices now appear to have established a foothold above $200, which means the floating supply at bear market lows has been absorbed, and the path of least resistance is upwards, as followers of the Wyckoff analysis method would describe it.

Ripple investors may benefit if the SEC case is dismissed by SEC leadership. SEC’s appeal could face setbacks, possibly leading to further legal delays. The ongoing legal dispute between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has kept many investors on edge. Legal expert John Deaton recently weighed in, offering insights into what might happen next in this high-profile case. With the SEC filing an appeal, many are left wondering if this could result in a prolonged battle or a swift resolution in favor of Ripple. No Solid Grounds for SEC Appeal Deaton, speaking on the Good Morning Crypto Show, stated that the SEC has little chance of winning an appeal. He thinks the SEC’s appeal is weak, especially because of the recent court decision. In the original ruling, Judge Analisa Torres found that the SEC failed to meet key criteria in its attempt to classify XRP sales to retail investors as unregistered securities. The SEC wants to change this ruling, but Deaton says the case would probably go back to Judge Torres, who may rule in Ripple’s favor again.

While Cardano (ADA), 1Fuel (OTF) , and Bitcoin (BTC) have demonstrated impressive performance in recent times, the question remains: which of these top altcoins is the best crypto coin to buy that can pull in the most returns on a $5,000 investment this year. This article will shed light on recent developments that will answer the question. Cardano hints at rally to $7: Top altcoins making waves Cardano’s ADA has been on a roller coaster since the start of this month, underperforming contemporaries like Bitcoin and Solana. However, crypto expert Big Mike has brought glad tidings to the Cardano community, projecting ADA’s imminent ascent to $7 in an X post on January 18. Big Mike substantiated his projection using the Elliot Wave Theory, an analytic principle that identifies extremes in price levels to forecast future trends. According to the analyst, ADA is in the third wave, gearing up for a surge to $3. After hitting the $3 target, Mike expects a pullback and another surge to $7 eventually. Meanwhile, the Cardano coin is 614% shy of Big Mike’s target from its current price of $0.98 . According to the analyst’s projection, a $5,000 investment in ADA will yield $30,700 in gains. However, focus has shifted to 1Fuel, which promises a 100x return. 1Fuel: Introducing game-changing cross-chain transactions Tired of managing multiple wallets and tokens for different networks?

Expert claims bitcoin is venturing into second price discovery uptrend The now-seated US President Donald Trump stunned the crypto community on January 17, 2025, when he launched a meme coin in his name, TRUMP. This launch triggered a surge in the prices of assets like Solana and Bitcoin, with the latter reclaiming the $100,000 level again. However, on January 20, the flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, reached an all-time high of $109,588 as anticipation of Trump’s inauguration speech mounted. Analysts like Daan Crypto commented on BTC’s behaviour, acknowledging its positive start to the week and asserting it would be a good week for the market. Altcoin Sherpa, another well-known expert, opined that BTC could form a God candle on its chart if Trump announces a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Meanwhile, Rekt Capital asserted that the first price discovery correction is over, and a second price discovery uptrend may be underway, which could send BTC to $150,000 this year. Although Bitcoin has slid from its all-time high to $101,402, it still maintains a 6.80% weekly gain . Compared to Bitcoin’s 48% target, which would turn a $5,000 investment into $7,400, 1Fuel hints at a 100X profit for investors. OTF signals a possible 100X profit for investors post-launch: Best crypto coin to buy? The OTF public presale is underway and moving at an extremely fast pace.

""I don't know much about it other than when I launched it. I heard it was successful,” Trump said in a press conference on Tuesday when asked by a reporter. “Where is it today? Several billion? “That's peanuts for these guys,” he added, referring to the networth of other businessmen in the room that included SoftBank's Masayoshi Son, OpenAI's Sam Altman and Oracle's Larry Ellison.

It sits at an $8 billion market capitalization as of Wednesday morning, up nearly 900% since going live. Trump also unveiled a $500 billion joint venture termed Stargate at the event, which aims to build data centers in Texas and would invest in AI infrastructure. Meanwhile, some see TRUMP as a bet on the Republican’s popularity and policies in his term, with ripple effects on how it may shape up Web3 and memecoin markets. “Longer term, TRUMP coin could act as a barometer for public sentiment towards Trump’s presidency,” Yat Siu, co-founder and executive chairman of Animoca Brands told CoinDesk in a message. “Culture memes and tokens are essentially a highly variable public polymarket of culture and zeitgeist, and we’ve seen this play out accordingly.” “(However) If the initiative is perceived as a cash grab without further engagement, we may well see a crypto chill for meme tokens, potentially draining attention and liquidity out of the meme space.

Recent burn data indicated that over 3 million tokens were taken out of the meme coin’s circulating supply. As an upshot, crypto enthusiasts expect a massive SHIB breakout ahead, driven by supply reduction and the community’s recent advancements. Shiba Inu Burn Rate Blows Over 600% Echoing Bullish Market Sentiments According to the latest data by Shibburn , the Shiba Inu burn rate shot up nearly 613% on January 22, dealing a massive blow to the circulating supply. Per the data, the massive burn rate surge came against the backdrop of 3.24 million tokens sent to a null address, thus permanently removing them from the supply. For context, the SHIB burn mechanism is designed to reduce the crypto’s market supply, which many believe to be the reason behind the dog-themed meme coin’s broader sluggish performance. Thereby, with the abovementioned burn rate surge weighing in, traders and investors anticipate price gains for the crypto asset in light of the law of supply and demand. Community Developments Add To Market Optimism Further, a stockpile of ecosystem developments in recent days appears to have additionally bolstered the market sentiment for Shiba Inu amid its burn rate surge. CoinGape reported that SHIB lead developer Shytoshi Kusama stated a “big week” lies ahead for the meme token. This statement has sparked market-wide speculations of a looming advancement for the coin’s community. Moreover, with American billionaire and investor Mark Cuban lauding SHIB’s potential recently, market watchers are extensively eyeing the crypto with bullish long-term views. Particularly in light of the community’s long-term goals and support, Cuban finds the meme coin to be one of the few promising projects in the sector. Overall, the Shiba Inu burn rate surge and these developments have solidified investors’ sentiments of a looming breakout, further driven by the recent pro-crypto Donald Trump frenzy. What’s Next For SHIB? At the time of reporting, SHIB price witnessed a 4% uptick in value, reaching $0.00002054. The coin’s 24-hour low and high were $0.00001983 and $0.00002127, respectively. Notably, the coin rises alongside the intraday Shiba Inu burn rate surge and positive market sentiments building against the backdrop of Trump’s win and meme coin sector recovery. After a waning action yesterday, DOGE, PEPE, and TRUMP, among other meme coins, witnessed a remarkable upswing. In light of this recovery-like trend, crypto enthusiast ‘VipRoseTr’ revealed on X that a $0.00004029 price target is ahead for the asset. Also, a recent Shiba Inu price analysis by CoinGape further cements the chances of a breakout approaching, as the coin showcases the potential to gain 100x this year. Source: Rose Premium Signals, X This bullish prediction comes riding the back of strong market technicals and price patterns, flagging that a potential run to $0.00003340, followed by the March 4 high of $0.0000455, is possible. However, the $0.00001565 support remains extensively eyed by market watchers, given the crypto realm’s dynamic nature.

Markets were choppy but stabilized after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission unveiled plans to overhaul rules and regulations for the sector. BTC is trading around $105,846 and has registered gains of nearly 10% over the past week. The crypto market has rebounded over the past 24 hours. Ethereum (ETH) rose nearly 3% to reclaim $3,300 and is currently trading around $3,342. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) is up 2.50%, while Solana (SOL) is up nearly 8%, remaining above $250. Dogecoin (DOGE) , Cardano (ADA) , Chainlink (LINK) , Tron (TRX) , Sui (SUI), Polkadot (DOT), and Litecoin (LTC) also registered substantial gains. The TRUMP meme coin is also up nearly 15%, gaining a staggering 530% since launch. SEC Gives Crypto First Win Of Trump Presidency The United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s new leadership has announced the creation of a task force to develop a clear regulatory framework for digital assets. This is the first attempt by the Trump administration to overhaul crypto policy. Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal said the SEC is moving quickly on Trump’s agenda, stating, “The president has moved quickly on his agenda. The SEC has made it clear they understand that and want to be a part of that.” The task force was created by the acting Chair of the SEC, Mark Uyeda. Its primary goal would be to develop a clear and comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto assets. SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce will lead the task force. Pierce has urged the public to collaborate with the SEC to shape the future of crypto. However, she added that the process would require significant time and effort. “This undertaking will take time, patience, and much hard work. It will succeed only if the Task Force has input from a wide range of investors, industry participants, academics, and other interested parties.” The task force was announced a day after former SEC Chair Gary Gensler stepped down, and President Trump nominated Uyeda as acting Chair. Trump has nominated Paul Atkins as the next Chair of the SEC. However, the pick is subject to approval from the US Senate. The SEC released a statement on its website regarding the task force, stating, “Drawing from talented staff across the agency, the Task Force will collaborate with Commission staff and the public to set the SEC on a sensible regulatory path that respects the bounds of the law. To date, the SEC has relied primarily on enforcement actions to regulate crypto retroactively and reactively, often adopting novel and untested legal interpretations along the way. Clarity regarding who must register and practical solutions for those seeking to register have been elusive. The result has been confusion about what is legal, which creates an environment hostile to innovation and conducive to fraud. The SEC can do better.” TRUMP, MELANIA Meme Coins Crash After Inauguration The cryptocurrency market witnessed a sharp pullback on Tuesday following the inauguration of Donald Trump. Despite reaching a new all-time high on Monday, Bitcoin (BTC) registered a dramatic drop, falling to $102,408 before recovering on Tuesday. The sharp decline came after Trump emphasized his plans for imposing trade tariffs, amending immigration policy, and energy deregulation. However, Trump did not make any specific references to crypto. Failure to mention crypto in his inaugural speech has left some market watchers disappointed at a time when expectations from the Trump administration regarding digital assets were sky-high. Matthew Dibb, the Chief Investment Officer at Crypto Asset Manager Astronaut Capital, stated, “I think in the short term there's a chance this could be a sell-the-news event. The market has some great expectations about a Bitcoin strategic reserve and a loosening of regulations around digital assets, but it's more likely these developments will be drip-fed over a series of months rather than days. Bitcoin has already retreated ... We expect further volatility here and likely a selloff.” The Trump administration is expected to introduce several regulatory changes and potentially create a Bitcoin strategic reserve. However, Trump’s involvement in the crypto market has led to ethical concerns and concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has registered a marginal dip during the ongoing session as it struggles to build momentum despite surging to an all-time high on Monday. BTC reached $109,350 on Monday but quickly plummeted to test the $100,000 support, dropping to an intraday low of $99,514 before recovering to settle at $102,408. BTC’s price action suggests that despite a bullish market, sellers are keeping pressure on the $100,000 price boundary. Trump’s inauguration day saw significant price volatility but disappointed many in crypto after the president failed to mention BTC, crypto, or a Bitcoin strategic reserve. As a result of the volatility, longs saw significant liquidations. One analyst on X stated, “I’d take a long from 99.5K~ if offered. I think the gray box needs to hold for local bullishness, and sweeping all the Trump leadup/news PA makes sense. I'd also accept a sweep of the 97K low, but that's the farthest it should go. Any good amount of time spent past 96-97K and my plan / read is likely off. Inval low 90's, aiming for new ATH's.” The Bitcoin price chart suggests considerable choppiness in the market, and we could see a definitive trend emerge by the end of the week. While BTC has maintained an upward trajectory after recovering from last week’s collapse, it has faced increasing volatility over recent sessions. BTC plummeted to an intraday low of $89,397 on Monday as selling pressure peaked. However, it recovered to reclaim $90,000 and ultimately settled at $94,492. Markets recovered on Tuesday, and BTC registered an increase of 2.19%, going past the 20-day SMA and settling at $96,566. Bullish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as BTC crossed the 50-day SMA, registering an increase of 3.61% and settling at $100,051. Sellers returned to the market on Thursday as BTC dropped to an intraday low of $97,094. However, it recovered from this level and settled at $99,798, ultimately registering only a marginal decline. Source: TradingView BTC made a strong recovery on Friday, rising almost 4% to surge past $100,000 and settle at $103,732. However, bearish sentiment and volatility returned over the weekend as BTC plummeted to an intraday low of $101,591 on Saturday before ultimately settling at $103,579. Buyers attempted a recovery on Sunday as BTC surged to an intraday high of $106,552. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and registered a drop of just over 2% to settle at $101,434. BTC rallied to a new all-time high on Monday when it hit $109,350. However, it rapidly declined after reaching this level and settled at $102,408, registering an increase of nearly 1%. Sellers attempted to drive BTC below $100,000 on Tuesday as the price dropped to an intraday low of $100,173. However, buyers bought the dip, allowing the price to recover. As a result, BTC rose 3.56% and ended the day at $106,054. The current session sees BTC marginally down as sellers look to drive the price below $105,000. However, if market sentiment changes and buyers regain control, BTC could see a move past $110,000. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) is trading close to the psychological $3,300 level as it continues to experience volatility, leading to a considerable lack of momentum. ETH’s price struggles come as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin lashed out at growing criticism of Ethereum Foundation executive director Aya Miyaguchi and calls for her to step down from her role. The ongoing tussle between the Ethereum Foundation and the Ethereum community has also had a detrimental impact on ETH, with the asset underperforming compared to BTC, XRP, and SOL over the past weeks. ETH’s price chart shows the asset experiencing significant volatility since recovering from an intraday low of $2,927 on Monday. ETH recovered to reclaim $3,000 and settle at $3,137 before registering an increase of 2.85% on Tuesday and moving to $3,336. Bullish sentiment registered a substantial increase on Wednesday as ETH surged past the 20-day SMA, rising nearly 7% to $3,450. However, buyers lost momentum after reaching this level, and ETH dropped 4.10% on Thursday to slip below the 20-day SMA and settle at $3,308. Buyers returned to the market on Friday, with ETH registering an increase of nearly 5% to move past the 20-day SMA and settle at $3,473. Once again, ETH was back in the red on Saturday, dropping nearly 5% to slip below the 20-day SMA and settle at $3,305. Source: TradingView Sellers retained control on Sunday after thwarting a recovery attempt. As a result, ETH dropped nearly 3% to $3,212. The current week began with ETH experiencing significant volatility as buyers and sellers attempted to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as ETH rallied to an intraday high of $3,446 before settling at $3,280. Buyers retained control on Tuesday, with ETH rising 1.44% to $3,327. However, ETH is struggling to move past the 20-day SMA, which acted as a dynamic resistance level. The current session sees ETH marginally down and trading just above the $3,320 level. If sellers continue to dominate the market, ETH could decline to $3,000. On the other hand, if buyers regain control, ETH could look to move past the 20-day SMA and push towards $3,500. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Like Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL) too surged to a new all-time high on Sunday, driven by the launch of the TRUMP and MELANIA meme tokens created on the Solana blockchain. The success of both meme coins generated considerable interest in SOL as well, helping boost the price. SOL has been bullish since recovering from an intraday low of $169 last Thursday. SOL recovered on Tuesday, rising 2.58% to $187. Bullish sentiment registered a substantial increase on Wednesday as SOL surged past the 20-day SMA and $200 to settle at $205 after rising nearly 10%. Buyers retained control on Thursday as SOL pushed above the 50-day SMA and settled at $211. Friday saw SOL register an increase of 4% and move to $219. Source: TradingView The weekend saw renewed buying activity as SOL surged a staggering 19.19% on Saturday to smash past $250 and settle at $261. Bulls retained control during the first half of Sunday as SOL surged to a new all-time high of $295. However, it could not get beyond this point as buyers lost momentum. As a result, sellers took over, and SOL dropped nearly 4% to $252. Buyers attempted a recovery on Monday as SOL reached an intraday high of $272. However, sellers took control and drove SOL below $250 to $241. The price recovered on Tuesday despite considerable volatility, rising 3.47% to reclaim $250. The current session sees SOL up by 2.31% and trading around $256. Buyers will look to build momentum and push towards $280-$290. Dogwifhat (WIF) Price Analysis Dogwifhat (WIF) has been trading in a downward trajectory since the weekend after failing to move past $2 on Sunday. WIF was quite bullish last week despite starting it on a bearish note. The meme coin recovered from Monday’s low to register an increase of nearly 4% on Tuesday and settle at $1.54. Bullish sentiment registered a substantial increase on Wednesday as WIF rallied a staggering 14% and settled at $1.76. With the 20-day SMA coming into play, WIF lost momentum on Thursday and registered a marginal decline. However, it recovered on Friday, rising 6.14% to move past the 20-day SMA and settle at $1.87. Source: TradingView Buyers attempted a move past $2 on Saturday as WIF reached an intraday high of $1.98. However, WIF lost momentum at this point and dropped over 5% to slip below the 20-day SMA and settle at $1.77. Bullish sentiment intensified on Sunday as WIF dropped nearly 14% to $1.53. The current week began with WIF firmly in the red, dropping over 9% to $1.38. Buyers returned to the market on Tuesday as WIF rose 4.50% to settle at $1.45. The current session sees WIF marginally down, trading around $1.43. Hedera (HBAR) Price Analysis Hedera (HBAR) surged to an intraday high of $0.402 on Friday but has since been trading primarily in the red as selling pressure intensifies. HBAR’s bullish momentum began on Tuesday when it registered a substantial increase of 4.25% to move past the 50-day SMA and settle at $0.287. Buying activity registered a significant increase on Wednesday as HBAR surged past the 50-day SMA and $0.30 to settle at $0.322 after an increase of 12.09%. Bullish sentiment persisted on Thursday as HBAR surged over 12% and moved to $0.361. The price reached an intraday high of $0.402 on Friday. However, buyers lost momentum at this point, and the price dropped to $0.373, an increase of 3.23%. Source: TradingView HBAR turned bearish over the weekend, dropping nearly 5% on Saturday and settling at $0.355. Bearish sentiment intensified on Sunday, with the price dropping 8.48% to $0.324. Buyers returned to the market on Monday as HBAR rose to an intraday high of $0.373. However, it could not go higher and ultimately settled at $0.342, registering an increase of 5.32%. HBAR registered a marginal decline on Tuesday, dropping nearly 3% during the ongoing session and trading around $0.327. Stellar (XLM) Price Analysis Stellar (XLM) surged past the 50-day SMA last Wednesday after registering a staggering rise of nearly 14% and moving to $0.488. Buyers pushed the price to an intraday high of $0.514 on Thursday. However, XLM lost momentum after reaching this level and dropped 1.28% to $0.482, but not before falling to an intraday low of $0.464. Buyers returned to the market on Friday as XLM rose 1.24% to $0.488. XLM dropped to an intraday low of $0.451 on Saturday as sellers attempted to drive the price below $0.45. However, XLM recovered from this level to register a marginal increase and end the day at $0.49. Source: TradingView Selling pressure returned on Sunday as the price plummeted over 11%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $0.433. The current week began with XLM rising to an intraday high of $0.477. However, the price could not push higher and ultimately settled at $0.445, registering an increase of nearly 3%. Bearish sentiment returned Tuesday as XLM dropped almost 1% to $0.441. The current session sees XLM down 2% and trading around $0,432.

Crypto could revamp the finance industry Johnson then discussed the potential for blockchain technology to revamp the financial industry as well as address challenges that have gone unnoticed for several years. She went on to predict that ETFs (exchange-traded funds) and mutual funds will “ultimately” be the next big products that will be built on top of distributed ledger technology. “I do think that it’s likely that ETFs and mutual funds will ultimately be built on blockchain just because it’s an incredibly efficient technology”. Johnson calls for crypto clarity under Trump In order for blockchain and crypto to address issues in the TradFi sector, Johnson stressed that a clear regulatory framework first needs to be developed to facilitate integration of the crypto and traditional finance sectors, saying, “We need to have some sort of regulatory clarity so that you could bring these together because, fundamentally, it will drive out costs.” She added that there is “great innovation that the technology enables”. The new Trump administration, which took office on Jan. 20, has yet to address crypto-related policies and regulatory challenges. Throughout his political campaigns, Trump predicted a sustainable and secure future for digital assets. This is the main reason analysts and crypto experts expect the President to review the current crypto regulatory framework in the US and propose initiatives that favor both the digital asset and financial sectors. Although Johnson is positive about the long-term potential of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, she compared the technologies to the late 1990s and early 2000s dot-com boom. “It’ll be a little bit like the dot-com era, eventually, you had some of the biggest companies of the next decade that came out of it, and then you had a lot that kind of blew away to the side. I think that the crypto world is similar,” Johnson added. The dot-com bubble peaked at $2.95 trillion in 2000 and eventually burst when speculative investments dried up. Despite the slump, companies such as Amazon and Google have emerged as digital economy leaders. Industry analysts believe that the current US government could become the most pro-crypto in history, especially under Trump. With a strong belief in innovation and a legal environment designed to encourage responsible growth, the convergence of crypto and TradFI has the potential to reshape the global financial world.

On Jan. 21, Critical Metals Corp, the first Nasdaq-listed mining company to announce such a move, revealed that its Board of Directors had approved a Bitcoin ( BTC ) treasury strategy. The company plans to hold Bitcoin as a primary asset in its treasury , treating it as a key asset in its treasury management strategy. Critical Metals Corp just became the first Nasdaq-listed critical minerals company to make Bitcoin its primary treasury reserve asset. They already have access to $100mm to buy bitcoin and could acquire up to $400mm more via a convertible debt raise. (s/o @Mason_Jappa ) pic.twitter.com/rVp2gp78sa — Sam Callahan (@samcallah) January 21, 2025 The strategy is supported by a financing agreement with JBA Asset Management, which allows Critical Metals Corp. access to up to $500 million to acquire Bitcoin. The first $100 million tranche is available for BTC purchases, subject to certain undisclosed conditions. The first $100 million comes with 100% warrant coverage. Simply put, this means that investors who put in money will have the right to buy extra shares of the company in the future, equal to the full amount they invested, at a fixed price. For the remaining $400 million, which is optional and could be accessed later, the coverage is 50%. This means that for every dollar invested, the investor can buy extra shares worth half the value of their investment, at a fixed price. The notes issued in the financing will be secured by the cash raised, and any BTC purchased under the program are convertible into the company’s common stock at a price of $6.00 per share, with warrants associated with the conversion at the cost of $7.00 per share.

Let’s Dive In To Find Out How & Why",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/which-of-these-will-make-you-rich-in-2025-cardano-ada-ripple-or-remittix-lets-dive-in-to-find-out-how-why/,"Many traders believe Cardano (ADA), Ripple (XRP), and Remittix (RTX) could be the top crypto investments of 2025 for those seeking major gains. While Cardano, Ripple, and Remittix each aim to offer unique advantages, only time will tell which token truly stands out. Some view these as high-growth altcoins, while others call them the best blockchain projects to watch. Below, we explore how Cardano, Ripple, and Remittix compare in today’s market. Cardano: A Key Player in the Market Launched by Charles Hoskinson, Cardano focuses on scalable, secure solutions. Currently priced around $1.04, it saw a -7.63% dip in the last day but remains up +2.54% this week and +8.74% over the past month. Many see Cardano (ADA) as one of the top crypto investments of 2025 because it supports future DeFi contenders through its advanced smart contracts. Some investors also compare its proof-of-stake model to newer projects like Remittix, which seeks to solve everyday finance issues. Despite recent market fluctuations, Cardano continues to attract developers. People call it the best blockchain project to watch for its long-term plans in DeFi. Staking on Cardano (ADA) can provide rewards, boosting user engagement. Critics say progress is sometimes slow, but fans argue quality upgrades take time. In contrast, tokens like Remittix move quickly to fix payment problems. Still, many Cardano backers believe it will keep climbing if it meets its roadmap goals. Ripple: A Force to Be Reckoned With Founded to revolutionize global payments, Ripple has made headlines, especially after recent legal updates. Priced near $3.06, Ripple (XRP) dropped -5.93% on the last day but still jumped +20.86% this week and +36.75% over the past month. This kind of growth leads some to call Ripple one of the top crypto investments 2025. By partnering with banks and payment providers, Ripple aims to reduce transaction costs worldwide, a goal somewhat shared by Remittix. Though lawsuits have caused uncertainty, many see Ripple rebounding if regulatory barriers ease. Large-scale deals also boost adoption for Ripple (XRP), proving it has real-world use. Still, new projects like Remittix could pose competition if they manage to solve remittance issues faster. While Ripple remains a major player, the crypto world is always evolving—tokens like Remittix can quickly catch up if they address pressing needs. Remittix: The Best to Outperform Unlike Cardano or Ripple, which both have been around for years, Remittix is a fresh token focusing on speedy cross-border transfers. Priced around $0.0256, Remittix (RTX) has already risen 125% since its early presale. Some investors call it one of the top crypto investments of 2025 due to its practical PayFi model, letting people convert digital funds to local money in under 24 hours. This direct approach gives Remittix an edge in the real world, where users want quick, affordable transactions. Early data shows Remittix raising millions in a short time, suggesting strong market interest. Unlike tokens that rely on hype, Remittix (RTX) targets actual remittance problems—such as high fees and long waiting times. If mainstream adoption continues, Remittix might outshine Cardano and Ripple. That’s why some see it as more than just a newcomer. Backers believe Remittix has the potential to offer greater returns, especially if its cross-border services become widely used. Conclusion Each of these coins—Cardano, Ripple, and Remittix—has a distinct advantage. Cardano (ADA) keeps advancing its blockchain tech, Ripple (XRP) maintains strong ties to financial institutions, and Remittix (RTX) focuses on speedy everyday payments. While no investment is guaranteed, many experts feel Remittix could see faster real-world growth by solving problems that affect millions of users right now. For anyone watching the top crypto investments 2025, all three deserve attention, but Remittix may well outperform the rest in the coming years.

This acquisition marks the company’s 11th consecutive week of Bitcoin purchases, reinforcing its status as a significant player in the digital currency space. Saylor has been at the forefront of this strategy, positioning the enterprise software company as a leveraged Bitcoin proxy. MicroStrategy Bitcoin Holdings Surge According to Microstrategy’s filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the firm acquired the Bitcoin at an average price of about $101,191 per token between January 13 and January 20. With this latest purchase, the firm now holds over 2% of all Bitcoin that will ever be mined, representing approximately $47.9 billion in total Bitcoin holdings. MicroStrategy has been funding these acquisitions through a combination of at-the-market stock sales and convertible debt offerings. Related Reading: Bitcoin Struggles For Direction Post-Trump Disappointment – What Next? The timing of this latest purchase aligns with a broader shift in the regulatory environment under President Donald Trump, who has transitioned from being a crypto skeptic to a supporter of the industry. This change is expected to create a more favorable regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, prompting Saylor and MicroStrategy to accelerate their capital goals and Bitcoin buying efforts. Ahead of Trump’s inauguration, the firm’s co-founder even attended the first ever “Crypto Ball” in Washington on Friday, where he engaged with key figures in the incoming administration. New Shares To Support BTC Strategy In a related development, MicroStrategy shareholders voted also on Tuesday to approve a staggering 30-fold increase in the number of authorized Class A common shares, raising it from 330 million to 10.3 billion. According to a Bloomberg report, this decision, which passed with around 56% of the vote, is designed to facilitate further financing for the company’s Bitcoin purchases. Additionally, shareholders voted to increase the authorized shares of preferred stock from 5 million to 1 billion. Related Reading: Is It Time To Give Up On Ethereum Below $4,000? Analyst Weighs The Facts These amendments will take effect once MicroStrategy files the necessary certificate of amendment with the Delaware Secretary of State. The report notes that with Chairman Saylor holding about 47% of the voting power, the outcome was largely anticipated. The newly authorized shares will also be utilized for various financial strategies, including private transactions of Class A stock, sales of at-the-market equity offerings, and settling redemptions or conversions of convertible notes. However, the company has indicated that it may choose not to sell all of the additional shares. At the time of writing, Bitcoin continues to experience significant price volatility, with its price hinting at a new record high. It is currently trading at $106,400, representing a 2.5% increase in the 24-hour time frame.

The peak occurred on Jan. 20, with validators receiving over 87,000 SOL, driven largely by the TRUMP token's rally, before MELANIA attracted bets. The surge in activity led to 24.7 million transaction bundles to ensure success. Of the 4.5 million daily active users on Solana, 1.5 million were unique tippers, showcasing interest in token sniping on platforms like Meteora and Orca. Bundles on Solana refer to collections of transactions that are grouped together and sent to validators for processing.

Starting with the wider crypto market, Zeberg tells his 174,400 followers on the social media platform X that the total market cap of crypto assets could increase by approximately 141% from the current level. “I think it will reach a size of approximately $9 trillion before the top! Insane Bubble – but let’s ride it.” The total crypto market is at $3.73 trillion at time of writing. Based on Zeberg’s chart, it appears he’s suggesting that the total crypto market cap is in a rising wedge pattern on the weekly time frame. It also appears that the economist is suggesting that the total crypto market cap is in the final wave of a five-wave pattern that started in 2018. According to the Elliott Wave theory, the main trend of the price of an asset moves in a five-wave pattern while a correction occurs in a three-wave pattern. Source: Henrik Zeberg/X Turning to memecoins, Zeberg says that despite “sucking liquidity” from other crypto assets, the official Donald Trump meme Official Trump ( TRUMP ) could be a blessing in disguise for the market. “This [TRUMP memecoin] may seem as a bad thing for crypto – but in fact this may well be the dynamics which unleashes the full crypto-mania. Like water on a beach pulling away – only to come back as a tsunami. Some Memes have been crushed the last few days/weeks. I think they put in major and massive bottoms.” One of the memecoins that Zeberg is bullish on is dogwifhat ( WIF ). Earlier this month, Zeberg predicted that WIF could rally by up to 1,238% from the current level. “WIF is about to explode higher in larger wave 3 – in an extended move which may reach as high as 18-19 USD in this next move!” WIF is trading at $1.42 at time of writing.

As a result, memecoins such as Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Trump coin, and Bonk have recorded the highest gains during this period. Successively, market players have been keen on icebreaker questions like: Will the memecoin segment maintain its bullish recovery and surpass its important resistance levels this week? Or is this another minor pump before the dump? In this article, CoinPedia’s expert panel has uncovered the market sentiment and possible price analysis of the top 3 memecoins by market cap. Dogecoin (DOGE) The Doge coin price has maintained its positive action by adding 8.26% in 24 hours and 17.79% over the last 30 days. Notably, with a YTD return of +16.16%, it has secured the 07th position with a market capitalization of $54.185 billion. TradingView: DOGE/USDT The Simple Moving Average (SMA) is on the verge of experiencing a bearish convergence in the DOGE price chart. Moreover, the MACD indicator records a similar price action in the daily time frame. However, considering the present market sentiments, a positive reversal cannot be ignored. Suppose, a bullish reversal occurs, under such a situation, the Dogecoin price will retest its upper high of $0.440 in the coming time. On the contrary, if the bears outrun the bulls, this could result in it plunging toward its low of $0.325. Wondering if DOGE memecoin will reach $3? Read CoinPedia’s Dogecoin Price Prediction to uncover the possible long-term mysteries! Shiba Inu (SHIB) Despite recording a bearish action this year, the SHIB coin price has jumped ~4% today with a trading volume of over $600 million. This meme coin has a Year-to-Date (YTD) return of -2.67% and has secured a market valuation of $12.124 billion. TradingView: SHIB/USDT The Relative Strength Index (RSI) records a bearish curve in the daily time frame. Moreover, the EMA 50/200-day shows a similar price action. This suggests a negative outlook for the second-largest meme coin by market cap. If the bulls regain momentum, the Shiba Inu price will breach its resistance level of $0.00002350 and head toward its upper resistance level of $0.00003080. However, a bearish reversal could pull the price of this meme coin toward its low of $0.000170. Are you planning on stacking the SHIB memecoins before they strike off a “0?” Read our Shiba Inu Price Prediction ! Bonk (BONK) With a jump of over 15% in 24 hours, the Bonk price has outperformed top cryptocurrencies. Reportedly, this Solana-based memecoin reclaimed a position among the top 50 cryptocurrencies with a market cap of over $2.51 billion. TradingView: BONK/USDT The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows a constant rise in the green histogram, with its averages recording an upward trajectory. Further, the SMA indicator supports the Bonk price chart in the daily time frame, suggesting a positive outlook. Maintaining a bullish price action could push the price of Bonk toward its upper resistance level of $0.00004050 this month. Conversely, a trend reversal could pull the price toward its low of $0.0000270. Curious to find out if Bonk memecoin will hit a new 52-week high this 2025?

Notably, the recent jump in DOGE value could be attributed to several factors including whale activity, growing institutional focus, and other related factors. Besides, Elon Musk has also refuted concerns over the recent lawsuits against Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.), which has further bolstered market sentiment. Elon Musk Refutes DOGE Lawsuit Concerns The Dogecoin price jump can be attributed to several factors, including Elon Musk’s reassurance regarding the lawsuits against the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.). Musk’s comments have bolstered market sentiment, potentially driving the meme coin’s price higher. The D.O.G.E. faced legal challenges just after Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20, with a US watchdog group alleging violations of federal transparency laws. Interestingly, the DOGE price also took a hit just after the development as investors grew concerned. However, recent comments from Elon Musk appear to have relieved the investors, while potentially pushing the meme coin’s price higher. For context, Elon Musk has recently shared an update on X which showed that DOGE has faced three lawsuits. Sharing the update, the tech mogul jokingly said: “Can someone start a lawsuit counter? How long until we hit triple digits?” Besides, Musk also recently said that “We’re going to take DOGE To Mars”, which has fueled investors’ confidence. Although, the remark was not directly related to Dogecoin, Musk’s previous backing for the meme coin has fueled speculations. Meanwhile, here we discuss several other catalysts that might have fueled the recent rally of the meme coin. Why Is Dogecoin Price Rising Today? Bullish Crypto Market Sentiment The broader crypto market recorded a strong rally today, indicating a bullish sentiment hovering in the market. Notably, as of writing, the global crypto market cap soared 3.5% to $3.63 trillion, with most of the top altcoins noting significant gains. Bitcoin price was up around 3.2% and exchanged hands at $105.5K, while altcoins like Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and others, also recorded a robust surge. The meme coins segment also showed a similar performance, indicating the growing confidence of the investors towards the risk-bet assets. DOGE Whale Buying The Dogecoin whales are also on a buying spree, which has supported the recent rally of the meme coin. In a recent X post, popular market expert Ali Martinez said that the whales or large investors had purchased around 590 million DOGE recently, indicating strong confidence of the traders. Source: Ali Martinez, X Meanwhile, this report contradicts the previous sentiment that whales had offloaded their holdings after the lawsuit. For context, a DOGE whale has recently dumped $140 million in Dogecoin, which has sparked concerns over a potential end to the meme coin frenzy. Dogecoin Price Soars Amid ETF Filings The recent ETF filings for the meme coin have further bolstered market sentiment. Recently, REX Shares, in collaboration with Osprey, has filed S-1 filings with the US SEC to launch a flurry of crypto ETFs. According to recent reports, the asset manager has filed for XRP, SOL, BONK, and DOGE ETFs with the regulators. Besides, it also included an application to offer the newly launched meme coin, TRUMP ETF to institutional investors, which showcases the soaring confidence towards the meme coins space. D.O.G.E. Featuring Dogecoin Logo Donald Trump has recently signed an order to launch the Department of Government Efficiency, which has sparked market optimism. Notably, the acronym of the department resembles with Dogecoin ticker. As a result, the developments of the department often influence the Dogecoin price. Having said that, the official website of D.O.G.E. featuring a Dogecoin logo has fueled market sentiment recently. It appears that this inclusion of the image has further cemented bets over a potential DOGE rally ahead. Dogecoin Price To Hit $0.5? DOGE price today surged 8.02% during writing and traded at $0.37 with its one-day trading volume jumping 17% to $8.46 billion. Notably, the crypto has touched a 24-hour high of $0.4, indicating strong market confidence. Besides, CoinGlass data showed that DOGE Futures Open Interest rose 6% to $4.96 billion, reflecting the bullish market sentiment. Amid this, market analyst Ali Martinez has shared a bullish forecast for the meme coin. According to Martinez, Dogecoin price is maintaining its position above “the breakout zone” and showing resilience. Having said that, he predicted a potential rally for the crypto ahead to $0.5. Source: Ali Martinez, X Echoing a similar sentiment, another market expert Rose Premium Signals also shared a bullish prediction. In a recent X post, the analyst has set three targets to watch for the Dogecoin price. According to the expert, Dogecoin price is gearing up for a strong rally and will hit $0.48 first, before a potential breakout to $0.57 and $0.66.

However, a very minimal impact has been seen on the token’s value, which suggests that external factors do not influence the trend. Besides, the emergence of new ‘Celebrity Coins’ like TRUMP, MELANIA, etc. has absorbed more than half of the total trading volume, which could have refrained the token from manifesting the required strength. Despite the rise of new tokens, the market participants remain bullish over primitive tokens like XRP, ADA, DOGE, LINK, etc., and a few more hints towards unexplored bullish divergences within these altcoins. Meanwhile, the XRP price, which is strongly advancing towards a $200 billion market capitalisation target, is believed to revamp a strong ascending trend soon. With this, the possibility of a new ATH remains elevated before the end of the month. The short-term price action of XRP displays an excessive contraction in the past few hours, which has prevented the token from massive bullish action. The bearish dominance appears to have superseded the bulls, which has restricted the rally within a descending, expanding channel. Besides, the stochastic RSI is failing to rise above the average range, which may keep the Bollinger bands within a parallel range. Therefore, the XRP price may continue to trade within the range for a while or until it reaches the apex, followed by a breakout beyond the range. This move could push the price towards the upper channel of Bollinger, while the breakout from this range could require a huge amount of buying liquidity. Currently, the volume has been rerouted to the other new tokens, which have also begun to plunge. Hence, in the coming days, this liquidity is expected to enter back into the primitive tokens, as more than 90% of traders are bullish about the XRP price rally. Hence, the price is believed to trigger a strong rise and mark fresh highs shortly.",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|MARKET|ADA|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-22 08:07:53

Many AI enthusiasts have termed the move as a turning point in the US’ journey to become a global leader in AI. Interestingly, at the time when the AI community is discussing the favourable environment created by the withdrawal of Biden’s EO on AI, OpenAI and SoftBank have jointly announced an ambitious AI infrastructure project, named Stargate. How does the project aim to reshape the US AI Infrastructure? And, how will this impact the AI crypto sector? Let’s examine! Stargate: Everything You Should Know Stargate, introduced by OpenAI and SoftBank, aims to strengthen the nation’s capability to train and run new AI models. According to reports, in the first stage, at least $100 billion will be invested. Reports also highlight that the total investment of the project may increase to as high as $500 billion in the next four years. Reports reveal that the first initiative of the project will be to build a data centre project in Abilene, Texas. Sources suggest that the Abilene data centre project has already begun. Trump Praises Stargate’s Impact US President Donald Trump has welcomed the announcement made by SoftBank and OpenAI, terming it as a ‘declaration of confidence in America.’ Explaining how this project will benefit the workforce of the US, he has mentioned the potential of the project to create at least 100,000 jobs in the near future. Stargate Leadership and Technology Partners As per reports, SoftBank chair Masayoshi Son will chair the project. Reports add that the financial responsibility of the project will be handled by SoftBank and the operational responsibility by OpenAI. Sources reveal that many conglomerates like Oracle, MicoSoft, Nvidia, Arm and MGX fund may join the project as its partners. Stargate’s Impact on AI Tokens The favorable developments that have occurred in the AI sector after Trump’s inauguration have positively impacted the AI token segment. In the last 24 hours alone, the AI token segment has seen a rise of 8.9%. Almost all the top ten AI tokens have experienced growth during the period. NEAR Protocol has surged by 5.9%, Internet Computer by 2.4%, Render by 8.4%, Bittensor by 10.8%, Artificial Superintelligence Alliance by 14.4%, Virtuals Protocols by 19%, The Graph by 4.5%, Arweave by 7.7%, and Akash Network by 9.0%. Importantly, the price of ai16z has witnessed a massive increase of 41,2% in the last 24 hours. Apart from that the share price of SoftBank Group Corp has climbed by 10.51% in the last 24 hours. In conclusion, the Stargate project represents a bold step toward making the US a global AI leader. Considering the impact the latest developments have made in the AI token segment, the project may benefit the overall crypto sector, particularly AI tokens, immensely in future.",News|Altcoins|Artificial Intelligence,EN,0,0,MARKET|NEAR|AKT|ALTCOIN|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-22 08:10:56
