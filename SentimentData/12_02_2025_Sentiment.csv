Unlike tokens relying purely on market speculation, MUTM offers decentralized lending and borrowing features within a structured ecosystem. This framework incorporates peer-to-peer lending, a stablecoin pegged to on-chain collateral, and a buy-and-distribute system intended to promote steady token value over time. Currently available in its initial presale phase at $0.01, MUTM provides early adopters an opportunity to acquire tokens before a series of 11 presale stages lifts the price to $0.06 at launch. Many analysts anticipate a significant uptick in MUTM’s valuation once the token is listed, pointing to it as an undervalued project that could eventually rival XRP and Solana. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Stands Out Mutuum Finance is set to make a lasting mark in decentralized finance by prioritizing real-world functionality rather than speculative hype. Through the platform, users can either generate passive returns by lending assets or secure crypto-backed loans without liquidating their holdings. Two lending models—Peer-to-Contract (P2C) for automated terms and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) for direct negotiations—ensure diverse and adaptable borrowing options. Central to Mutuum Finance’s roadmap is its planned stablecoin, fully backed by collateral and deployed on Ethereum. This stablecoin aims to broaden lending possibilities while minimizing volatility. In contrast to protocols reliant on off-chain reserves, Mutuum Finance provides transparent minting via deposited collateral. With security at the forefront, all smart contracts will undergo audits by an established firm. During this first presale stage, tokens are priced at $0.01, climbing up to $0.06 by the final round. Over 7 million tokens have already been sold, raising more than $70,000 from investors eager to lock in these discounted rates. To help stabilize MUTM’s value and mitigate extreme price swings, the project has implemented a buy-and-distribute mechanic. A portion of fees collected from lending and borrowing is used to purchase MUTM tokens on the open market, which are then distributed to mtToken stakers. This approach not only encourages long-term holding but also applies regular buy pressure on the token, potentially leading to a steadier price trajectory after launch. Mutuum Finance’s beta platform is slated to go live alongside its listing on exchanges, allowing token holders to immediately engage with the lending and borrowing services. This eliminates much of the uncertainty that accompanies pre-product launches in the crypto space and fosters a sense of reliability among investors. Additionally, Mutuum Finance is hosting a $100,000 giveaway for early participants, with ten winners each receiving $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. Interested users can enter by following the project’s official channels and performing specific tasks. On Track to Rival Established Projects With an actionable roadmap, a rapidly growing community, and tangible DeFi use cases, Mutuum Finance offers a compelling alternative to more established tokens like XRP and Solana. As its presale continues to gather momentum, the project’s utility-focused design and built-in mechanisms for sustaining price stability position MUTM as an undervalued opportunity well worth considering. Early adopters who secure tokens now could potentially see significant returns as the platform moves closer to its full-scale launch.

This impressive rally has positioned Litecoin as one of the top-performing altcoins during a period of market uncertainty. Analysts and investors are now speculating about the potential for a massive breakout in the coming weeks as Litecoin continues to show relative strength compared to other cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Cardano Is Showing Signs Of A Potential Rebound As Key Indicator Flashes A Buy Signal – Analyst Top analyst BigCheds shared a detailed technical analysis, revealing that Litecoin is approaching daily range peaks and gearing up to test multi-year highs around the $145 mark. This key resistance level has been a critical zone for Litecoin in previous cycles, and breaking above it could signal the start of a significant upward trend. Litecoin’s recent momentum has caught the attention of both retail and institutional investors, who are watching closely for signs of a confirmed breakout. With the broader market still consolidating, Litecoin’s ability to outperform could set the stage for a bullish continuation, potentially taking the price to new heights. As the crypto market braces for its next move, Litecoin’s price action remains a focal point for traders. Breaking past the $145 level would solidify its bullish narrative and pave the way for further gains. Litecoin Prepares For A Breakout Litecoin has shown impressive relative strength, surging over 30% in the past week, while the broader market continues to face indecision. This notable performance has captured the attention of analysts and investors, with some expecting Litecoin to lead a bullish rally that could break multi-year highs and push into higher supply levels. However, caution remains among market experts, as the current price action could result in a fake breakout. Top analyst BigCheds shared a technical analysis on X, revealing that Litecoin is approaching daily range peaks. According to him, the key level to watch is around $145, a critical resistance zone that has acted as a barrier in the past. BigCheds stated that while the price momentum is promising, he remains skeptical until Litecoin can decisively clear this level and hold it as support. The next few days will be crucial for Litecoin as altcoins across the market are finding support, and Bitcoin flirts with reclaiming the $100K mark. If Litecoin can sustain its momentum and break above the $145 level, it could solidify its position as one of the leading altcoins in the current market cycle. Conversely, failing to clear this key level could lead to a retracement, testing lower support zones. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Multi-Year Bullish Pattern – Expert Suggests The Next Move Will Be ‘The Real Deal’ As the market watches closely, Litecoin’s ability to hold above recent gains and break past resistance will likely dictate its direction in the coming weeks. Whether this move is the start of a bullish rally or another fake-out remains to be seen, but its price action is undoubtedly setting the stage for significant market moves. LTC Testing Crucial Supply Levels Litecoin (LTC) is trading at $127 after experiencing a strong bullish surge, climbing over 23% in less than two days. The recent price action has been impressive, as LTC reclaimed range highs and successfully pushed above the critical $120 mark. This move has shifted market sentiment, placing significant pressure on bears as the price approaches the next key resistance zones at $140 and $145. The $140 and $145 levels represent crucial supply zones that have historically acted as barriers to further upward movement. A breakout above these levels would not only signal a continuation of the bullish trend but also set the stage for Litecoin to test its multi-year high at $147. Analysts believe that reclaiming and holding above this level would trigger a massive rally, potentially propelling LTC into uncharted territory. Related Reading: Solana Holds Support Above Key Indicator – Expert Sees Push To ATH If Momentum Returns However, the coming days will be critical for Litecoin’s price trajectory. Bulls need to maintain momentum and defend current levels to sustain this upward move. If LTC successfully breaks above $147, it could attract more buyers, fueling further gains. Conversely, failing to clear these resistance levels could lead to consolidation or a minor retracement before another attempt at a breakout. All eyes are now on Litecoin as it approaches a decisive phase.

With its presale concluded, the spotlight moves to future market possibilities. Traders involved in the best crypto presale for 5thScape are now scouting for another prospect that promises robust returns and long-term growth potential.

As a result, the recent Bitcoin dip resulted in established projects like Cardano and meme coins like PEPE witnessing a market downturn. Therefore, investors are rotating to PropiChain as the next big opportunity with the potential to outperform other projects. This text will look into the Bitcoin price dip and how it sets PropiChain up for an explosive upside trajectory. The Bitcoin Price and its Impact on Cardano (ADA), PEPE, and PropiChain (PCHAIN) On the 2nd of this month, the Bitcoin price action dipped and was trading around the $92k range. This correction was a reaction to the global trade conflicts on import tariffs. Before the BTC dip, ADA was trading above $0.8, and following Bitcoin’s decline, it almost lost the $0.6 support level. PEPE, on the other hand, was at an $18 billion market cap at some point last month. Following the decline, it lost the $4 billion market cap support and has been trying to regain it. Even though the Bitcoin price has exceeded the $100k mark more than 3 times since its decline, PEPE and ADA are still struggling to regain momentum. Amid the Bitcoin price correction, PCHAIN’s presale keeps witnessing a massive inflow of investors. More than $2.5 million has been raised, and it is believed to be the best token presale in 2025. It is currently going for a low entry price of $0.011 in the second stage of its presale, which is set to increase by more than 100% in the third round. Here Are Some Offerings of PropiChain that is Driving the Hype Around the Project PropiChain’s proposed revolution in the real estate industry will benefit both existing and intending investors. The featured artificial intelligence, for instance, touches almost all aspects of the industry. It can help you get an asset that matches your investment goals. For instance, using the advanced filter tools returns recommendations closer to what you want. Potential ROI, substantial rental income, etc., can be your filter search keyword to suggest properties with increasing values or those suitable for rental. The PropiChain AI also offers predictive market analysis; therefore, making the right choice from the recommended assets is certain. It can do this by analyzing all the applicable data, such as past and present price performances, market trends, and other economic factors. Even if the property of your interest is on foreign soil, reaching the seller, inspecting, and acquiring it is possible remotely. PropiChain will integrate the 3D Metaverse environment to enable virtual meetings amongst international buyers and sellers. When it’s time to inspect, the 3D representation gives detailed information. Touring in an interactive environment is better than pictures and more cost-effective compared to flying abroad to inspect in person. All these ensure PropiChain investors experience advanced real estate early. Activities like leasing, lease renewal, and rental payment can be programmed. Thanks to smart contracts on PropiChain , you can set lease terms, and once you and your lessee reach a consensus, a legally binding contract can be formed without needing bulky legal papers. These smart contracts can further notify the landlord and tenants of the need to renew their agreement. The simple process involves the lessee agreeing to the updated terms sent by the smart contracts and instant renewal is processed. It can also be programmed to renew the lease once the terms agreed are met. The exact process can automate monthly rentals, and payments will be processed from users’ wallet balances. Unlike traditional financial services, payment is swift on PropiChain’s decentralized platform, and there is no need for long, unnecessary processing. Why PropiChain Will Outperform Cardano and PEPE Unlike PEPE, which thrives on speculative trading, and ADA, which is struggling with momentum, The real life application of PCHAIN is revolutionary and backed by a trillion-dollar sector. Being able to influence an ever-booming real estate industry is one of the many reasons experts believe so much in PropiChain . It has also raised over $2.5 million as the second presale increased momentum. This makes it an ideal choice for investors who want projects that can replicate the Bitcoin price 2013 surge. The early listing on CoinMarketCap has increased the project’s visibility in the global crypto market. Therefore, experts are forecasting it could deliver 30000% by early Q2 2025. Conclusion The BlockAudit positive report on PCHAIN is another testament to the legitimacy of this token. This report confirmed the security system is solid, and protecting investors’ assets is a top priority of the project. With this confirmation, smart investors are participating more with enhanced confidence. The Bitcoin price drops, but PropiChain maintains its increasing traction across the crypto world. Stage one investors are already in profit from the presale increase in value. The $0.011 will soon increase in the 3rd presale stage. Making now the best time to join. With the forecasted 30,000%, an investment of $1000 in this round could potentially yield $300k by early Q2 2025. Join now to position for a project that can replicate the Bitcoin price action early days surge in a few weeks.

In 2025, the buzz around certain presales is palpable, with Web3Bay leading the pack thanks to its unique decentralized e-commerce platform. Alongside Web3Bay, 5thScape and MEMEX are quickly making names for themselves as the top presale crypto projects to watch. Here’s a deeper dive into why these three crypto projects should be on your radar this week. 1. Web3Bay – The Top Presale Crypto Project Right Now Web3Bay shines in the presale arena, introducing a decentralized marketplace that aims to overhaul conventional e-commerce. The platform empowers users to manage their data and transactions securely, reflecting the increasing demand for privacy and safety online. Since the start of its presale, Web3Bay has collected over $1.1 million, selling 295 million tokens at $0.004562625 each. Currently, in Stage 4 of its presale, Web3Bay is gearing up for price hikes in subsequent phases of its 28-stage rollout. Early participants could see substantial gains, with the final token price projected at $0.1959. Given the solid investor interest and rising demand, Web3Bay’s presale could deliver returns similar to past blockchain successes, where early backers achieved gains ranging from 100 to 1,000 times their initial investment. Web3Bay sets itself apart from fleeting meme-centric projects by focusing on real-world utility and sustainable development, aiming to deliver real value to both individual users and businesses within its network. That’s why Web3Bay is highlighted as a top choice among presale crypto projects, promising significant long-term benefits following its official launch. 2. 5thScape – Pioneering the Future of VR and Metaverse A key project among the top presale crypto projects is 5thScape, which blends blockchain with virtual reality (VR). This initiative has already secured over $9.4 million, focusing on revolutionizing gaming, healthcare, and education through a VR ecosystem that lets users earn from their time in digital domains. 5thScape is set to become a significant force in both the metaverse and VR industries, which are expanding quickly. As it moves into new sectors, investors are eyeing considerable growth opportunities. Anticipation for 5thScape’s listings on exchanges like MEXC and BitMart is high, positioning it as a vital presale to monitor in the near future. 3. Meme Index – Broadening Meme Coin Investment Horizons The allure of meme coins has grown, yet the risk involved with individual investments remains high. MEMEX introduces a solution by offering a diversified portfolio of meme coins, enabling investors to manage risk by spreading investments across several assets, rather than relying on a single coin. Already attracting substantial attention, MEMEX offers staking and governance to token holders, presenting a less volatile entry into the meme coin market. For those seeking to mitigate risks while still tapping into the meme coin sector’s growth, MEMEX stands out as an appealing choice in top presale crypto projects, with proven scalability in the bustling meme coin arena. Key Crypto Presales to Watch Crypto presales provide an exclusive chance for investors to enter projects at early stages, often at prices well below eventual market rates. Web3Bay, 5thScape, and MEMEX are three diverse ventures offering unique entry points into different facets of the crypto world. Web3Bay is at the forefront with its decentralized marketplace and strong presale traction, aiming for long-term viability and substantial returns as it evolves. 5thScape, meanwhile, is carving out a leadership position in the virtual economy through its blockchain-enabled VR experiences. MEMEX, on the other hand, makes investing in meme coins simpler and safer with its diversified token basket, helping investors mitigate risk while still enjoying the sector’s growth potential. For those eager to invest early in promising ventures, these presales offer a chance to secure a position at the foundation, with the potential for hefty gains as the projects mature. However, thorough due diligence is always advised before making any investment decisions. If you’re considering diversifying your portfolio, Web3Bay, 5thScape, and MEMEX are worth a closer look this week.

Now, after three straight months of Bitcoin (BTC) dominance, it seems the altcoin market is ready to push back with a major inflow of investments into the sector. However, what’s most interesting from this altcoin rally are the lucrative opportunities expected to emerge, like the 22,000% explosion of the PropiChain (PCHAIN) AI altcoin, which powers a game-changing blockchain solution for the $634 trillion real estate industry. Bitcoin (BTC) Rally Slows Down: Is It Time For Altcoins to Shine? Bitcoin (BTC) took the market by storm over Q4 2024, running from $60k to $100k, making and breaking new all-time highs over the shortest span of its history. However, the same couldn’t be said for altcoins. When Bitcoin (BTC) was $60k, Ethereum (ETH) was $3k. Then BTC hit $80k, but ETH remained at $3k. BTC then set a new all-time high of $108k, and to much surprise, Ethereum failed to pump, sitting at $3k levels. While strange, analysts say the reason for this was a mega Bitcoin FOMO, which saw governments, institutions, and retail traders race to secure their spot early before BTC began its journey to $1m. But recent charts show a major Bitcoin (BTC) rejection , indicating that the hype is dying down, which will make way for altcoins to capitalize. Now begs the question: which altcoin is the best to buy now? Surprisingly, established altcoins have been displaced by the PropiChain (PCHAIN) AI altcoin, which could outperform the market in Q1 with a 22,000% run. PropiChain (PCHAIN) Real Estate Solutions Attracts 22,000% Rally for its AI Altcoin PropiChain (PCHAIN) isn’t just making an impact; it’s rewriting the rules of the $634 trillion real estate market while simultaneously revolutionizing Web3 and AI-powered investing. By merging blockchain with artificial intelligence, PropiChain is dismantling financial barriers, injecting liquidity into an industry notorious for its rigidity, and reshaping how properties are bought, sold, and managed. While PropiChain offers a suite of groundbreaking innovations, its AI investment solutions are emerging as the ultimate game-changer. The platform’s intelligent algorithms eliminate inefficiencies, streamline complex transactions, and introduce automation that the real estate sector has never seen before. PCHAIN token holders gain an edge with always-on AI assistance, instant property appraisals, predictive analytics, and real-time investment insights. PropiChain’s auto-trading functionality allows investors to capitalize on profitable deals 24/7 – executing high-value transactions even in their sleep. Yet, the most disruptive feature is PropiChain’s fractional ownership model , which levels the playing field in an industry historically reserved for the ultra-wealthy. PropiChain allows anyone to own a stake in high-value properties by tokenizing real estate on a secure blockchain, unlocking opportunities that were once out of reach. For as little as $100, investors can secure a 0.01% share in a $1 million asset, turning real estate from an illiquid, slow-moving investment into a liquid, tradeable asset. This seismic shift reduces transaction times from the industry-standard 44 days to mere minutes and drives an influx of capital that could reshape the global property market. PropiChain’s innovation doesn’t stop there. Its metaverse marketplace takes real estate into the digital age, offering virtual property tours, staging tools for design experimentation, and a seamless, borderless trading experience. Paired with smart contracts that automate rent collection, lease renewals, and management tasks, PropiChain (PCHAIN) is cementing itself as the definitive Web3 platform for the future of real estate. Security & Credibility: Two Powerful Reasons to Bet on PropiChain With so many crypto projects failing to meet basic security standards, investors are right to be cautious. That’s why PropiChain’s recent BlockAudit certification is so important. Known for its uncompromising audits, BlockAudit meticulously reviewed PropiChain’s smart contracts and security framework, finding no weaknesses or hidden risks. This stamp of approval assures investors that their funds are protected on a fully secure and transparent platform. Adding to this credibility boost, PropiChain has now been listed on CoinMarketCap , a key milestone that puts it in front of millions of investors worldwide. Visibility on this leading crypto tracking site signals that PropiChain is a legitimate and rapidly growing force in blockchain real estate. PropiChain Presale Surges as the Bitcoin Market Dominance Wanes PropiChain (PCHAIN) is emerging as the first commercially viable blockchain solution for real estate, set to redefine how properties are tokenized, traded, stored, and managed. With the real estate industry on the brink of a blockchain-driven transformation, the PCHAIN presale presents a rare opportunity to invest in a project poised to outshine much of the crypto market in 2025. Currently, in round two, PCHAIN is priced at just $0.01, which is the lowest it will ever be. Savvy investors are quietly accumulating their positions, recognizing that this stage offers the highest upside potential before prices rise. However, the tide is shifting fast, considering the sheer profit potential. Today’s modest $1,250 investment could grow to a staggering $275,000 by the end of Q1 as the Bitcoin (BTC) market dominance wanes. Early Bitcoin (BTC) holders especially know that opportunities like this don’t come twice. PropiChain will never be this undervalued again, and those who hesitate risk missing out on what could be a once-in-a-lifetime wealth-building event.

Other countries signed the agreement which pledges to inclusive, open, and ethical development and deployment of the technology. However, the two countries believe there is too much emphasis on AI regulation, which is not healthy for the growth of the industry. The UK and US think otherwise According to BBC , a dozen other countries including China, France, and India, signed the AI declaration which is meant to support AI safety. The UK, in a brief statement revealed that it had not added its name to the list due to concerns about national security and “global governance.” Earlier, US Vice President JD Vance told delegates in Paris that too much regulation on the technology could “kill a transformative industry just as it’s taking off.” He added the technology was an opportunity that the Trump administration would not want to waste, adding pro-growth AI policies should be prioritized over safety. This is in sharp contrast to what the French President Emmanuel Macron said as he supported the need for further regulation. “We need these rules for AI to move forward.” President Macron. Vice President Vance’s comments also conflict with the position that UK previously held as it championed AI safety. The then prime minister Rishi Sunak held the first global AI Safety Summit in November 2023. The UK government revealed in a statement that it “agreed with much of the leader’s declaration” yet felt it was lacking some parts. “We felt the declaration didn’t provide enough practical clarity on global governance, nor sufficiently address harder questions around national security and the challenge AI poses to it.” UK government spokesperson. A trade body representing businesses in the sector across the country, UKAI opines this is a step in the right direction. “UKAI cautiously welcomes the Government’s refusal to sign this statement as an indication that it will explore the more pragmatic solutions that UKAI has been calling for – retaining opportunities to work closely with our US partners.” UKAI CEO Tim Flagg. “While UKAI agrees that being environmentally responsible is important, we question how to balance this responsibility with the growing needs of the AI industry for more energy,” said Flagg. Is the UK undercutting its credibility? According to Andrew Dudfield, head of AI at Full Fact, a fact-checking organization said the UK’s decision to refuse to sign the agreement puts it in jeopardy. “By refusing to sign today’s international AI Action Statement the UK Government risks undercutting its hard-won credibility as a world leader for safe, ethical and trustworthy AI innovation,” he said. The Paris communique seeks to limit the digital divide by promoting accessibility to the AI technology. It also seeks to ensure AI development is “transparent,” “safe,” as well as “secure and trustworthy.” “Making AI sustainable for people and the planet,” is listed as a further priority. According to the BBC, the agreement also touches on AI energy use. Experts have warned that AI energy use could balloon to as much as what small countries require in years to come. “Looking at the summit declaration, it’s difficult to pinpoint what exactly in that statement the government disagrees with,” said Michael Birtwistle, associate director at the Ada Lovelace Institute. The UK has also insisted that the decision was not influenced by the Trump administration but purely guided by “our own national interest, ensuring the balance between opportunity and national security.” World over, executives, diplomats and policymakers have been considering methods to capture the economic benefits of the AI technology , while addressing its technology’s risks.

In a new announcement from Uniswap Labs, the firm says Unichain mainnet officially launched today according to plan. As per the announcement, Unichain will be a layer-2 optimized for decentralized finance (DeFi) transactions on Ethereum. Starting today, developers can use Unichain to begin deploying apps and building with stablecoins, and users of the new layer-2 can fund their wallet, launch tokens, play with new apps, provide liquidity and do swaps, according to the blog post. A post from Unichain to the social media platform X broke down the new chain’s advantages into three main points. “Unichain mainnet is live – Fast with low fees – Built for cross-chain liquidity – Prioritizes decentralization from day one You can now deploy DeFi apps, launch tokens, swap, provide liquidity, and more.” Within hours of launching, leading US crypto exchange Coinbase announced support for Unichain. “Coinbase Onramp is expanding to Unichain. Unichain users now have a seamless way to convert fiat-to-crypto, with fee-free USDC on-ramping available at launch. Unichain is a fast, decentralized Superchain L2 designed to be a home for DeFi and cross-chain liquidity.” Uniswap labs announced the launch of the mainnet last month. “Once the new system’s safety and stability are validated, mainnet will be open for everyone! Users will be able to bridge funds directly to the network, and applications supporting Unichain will go live.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The altcoin space took the most beating, with the global market cap experiencing one of its biggest devaluations on record. Last week, Bitcoin investors endured what Glassnode called an intense whipsaw in price action. The leading digital asset saw its price initially fall as low as $93k, after which it recovered briefly and rallied to $102k. Now, it is trading closer to $95k. 14-day Bitcoin price chart, since January 29. Source: Glassnode The realized losses recorded by Bitcoin investors during those choppy swings in price action is being touted as one of the largest of the current bull market cycle. Bitcoin investors see small respite despite losses Investors lost around $520M as the market sold off to $93k, making it one of the largest local capitulation events so far. In fact, only the losses locked in on August 5, 2023, during the yen-carry trade unwind, stand out as a larger one-day loss. The majority of realized losses were recorded by short-term holders, especially those who acquired their coins within the last month. Their willingness to sell at a loss hints at their sensitivity to price fluctuations. The volatile price action is, for the most part, a response to President Trump’s threat of tariffs applied to Canada, Mexico, and China, which provides an uncertain macro backdrop for investors as everyone watches the drama play out. Besides this, the persistent strength of the US dollar has contributed to a marginally stressed liquidity environment. Fortunately, even though the price of Bitcoin has fluctuated wildly in recent weeks, it has not strayed very far from its starting position during this cycle, so the choppy price action and generally sideways movement continue to prevail. This is thanks to the substantial uptick in liquidity entering Bitcoin and larger capital flows that are balancing the inertia of an increasingly large asset. The growing presence of a more resilient and patient group of holders has also contributed to the relative stability BTC prices are enjoying, even amidst the relatively unstable macro backdrop. Will the bull run ever reach the altcoin sector? While Bitcoin has not been immune to the volatility in the markets, Glassnode analysts believe it is doing relatively well. The same can not be said for the altcoin sector, which experienced significant sell-side pressure amidst the volatility as many assets struggled to achieve widespread adoption or product-market fit, presenting a more challenging market environment. This has led to a wide-scale collapse of token prices, with all altcoin sub-sectors underperforming Bitcoin in recent weeks. Using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) which projects the correlation of token returns into a two-dimensional space to analyze the downside price action, they found that the majority of ERC-20 tokens are densely clustered. What this means is that a good majority of altcoins had to deal with the same broad-based sell-off, without as much an unexplainable distinction between different sectors. In short, very few tokens were immune to the downside volatility as most of the market dipped at once. The magnitude of the dip becomes more apparent when examining the 14-day change in the global altcoin market cap. Over the last two weeks, $234B left the altcoin market cap. The altcoin market is essentially in a bear market, which is very interesting because as it stands, Bitcoin is having a good run and is not displaying the same relative weakness. This suggests a divergence is opening up between BTC and the rest of the digital asset landscape. Key support levels for Bitcoin have been identified at the Mean MVRV Z-Score of $96.3k and the short-term holder cost basis around $92.2k. Meanwhile, the outlook for the altcoin sector is more uncertain and less optimistic, with hopes of an altcoin market fading with its hemorrhaging valuation.

Now he needs a court order to get it back, according to a Monday filing in Delaware bankruptcy court. At the time Bartusek made the deposit, Solana was worth $31, putting his deposit’s value at around $63,700. Since then, Solana’s price has surged to $198, meaning his locked-up funds are worth $396,000 as of press time. According to the filing , FTX “knowingly and willingly” accepted the deposit. Now they’re telling Bartusek that he would need a court order to withdraw the funds. Bartusek’s issue began when he attempted a withdrawal request on October 22, 2023, from a crypto wallet linked to BTSE, another exchange. Instead of moving his 2,000 SOL to a different account, he accidentally deposited it into his old FTX account, which you’d think would have been frozen since the company was knee-deep in the middle of bankruptcy proceedings. But they weren’t, and by the time Bartusek realized the mistake, FTX’s legal team told him that his funds couldn’t be returned without a judge’s approval. Bankruptcy law prevents companies from distributing funds outside an approved court process, meaning even accidental deposits remain locked. Bartusek’s attorney, Jack Shrum, said that cases like these aren’t uncommon. “Some people utilize several different crypto wallets, so depositing into one wallet that happens to be in bankruptcy is not difficult to imagine,” he explained. Unfortunately, Bartusek isn’t the only one struggling to retrieve funds. Thousands of FTX users have been stuck in limbo since FTX collapsed in November 2022, with customer withdrawals frozen for over two years, waiting to see if they will ever recover their lost assets. FTX’s bankruptcy team finally started paying back some customers on Feb. 8. Under the FTX Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization, the company confirmed that initial distributions will begin on Feb. 18, but they apply only to creditors with approved claims in the Convenience Classes, meaning users who completed the pre-distribution requirements. Customers eligible for repayments should expect their funds within one to three business days from February 18. According to its official press announcement, FTX has transferred funds to BitGo and Kraken, which are acting as Distribution Service Providers. These companies will handle retail and institutional distributions in supported jurisdictions according to the bankruptcy plan.

This is in line with the acknowledgment of Grayscale’s Solana ETF application, which was made in the previous month. SEC ACKNOWLEDGES FILING FOR CANARY SPOT SOLANA ETF — Phoenix » PhoenixNews.io (@PhoenixNewsIO) February 11, 2025 The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has also initiated a comment period for a 21-day period. This will be followed by either approval, rejection, or an extension of the duration of review by the agency. The filing comes amidst a rising number of crypto-related ETFs aiming to gain state approval. Compared to the previous years, many expect a more favorable stance from the SEC compared. The application resembles one that was used for Bitcoin ETFs, which were previously approved. According to market analysts, Grayscale’s Solana ETF, which is slightly ahead in the process of review, may serve as a precedent for future ETF applications, including that of Canary. Institutional players enter the Solana ETF race Cboe BZX Exchange has also filed rule changes to list spot Solana ETFs from various issuers, such as 21Shares AG, Bitwise, Van Eck, and Canary Capital. The filings represent a notable move toward the introduction of the altcoin ETFs in the conventional financial markets. Franklin Templeton has also entered the race by filing documents for a Delaware Solana Trust. The firm had in the past reported a positive outlook on Solana regarding its growing adoption and use cases. Like other issuers, Franklin’s filing hints it could soon submit a full ETF application. Interest in Solana from institutions is still rising. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan, JPMorgan estimates that an approved Solana ETF could attract $3bn to $6bn in net assets within its first year. Some experts believe this will also fast-track the adoption of other altcoin ETFs, including XRP and Dogecoin. James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg ETF analysts, estimate a 70% chance of Solana ETFs receiving approval this year. They base their analysis on the SEC’s changing stance on digital assets.

Or, he might simply remain a billionaire. The answer depends on who you ask. According to startup founders and AI experts, the firm’s value estimates range from $1 billion to $150 billion. The mid-range puts the firm between $2 billion and $30 billion, placing Liang with his 84% stake among Asia’s wealthiest tech moguls, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index . DeepSeek shrouds its valuation in secrecy, leaving investors guessing Since the funding and revenue of DeepSeek are not openly available to the public, it has not been easy to come up with the correct value for the company. This company is privately owned, and according to the available information, it has been financed by Liang’s hedge fund trading proceeds. “It’s basically impossible to give a convincing answer here because it’s a secretive firm,” says Jeffrey Emanuel, the founder of Pastel Network. DeepSeek’s public relations have chosen to stay neutral and have not commented on the company’s valuation, leaving the competition for the sources of the estimates. AI specialists and startup founders have analyzed DeepSeek’s valuation. Glasswing Ventures Managing Partner Rudina Seseri values the company at a minimum of one billion dollars compared with other AI firms such as OpenAI and Anthropic. However, some, such as Chanakya Ramdev of Sweat Free Telecom, think that DeepSeek can be worth half of OpenAI’s $300 billion valuation but is higher than Nvidia’s Jensen Huang. The current discussions on DeepSeek’s valuation are being conducted at a time of surge in AI investment. For instance, Anthropic, an AI company supported by Amazon, is worth $60 billion, while Mistral AI from France is worth $6 billion. Comparisons have also been drawn with China’s Zhipu AI, valued at $3 billion. However, it is hard to determine the stability of this sector because it is volatile. Recently, Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, rejected a $97.4 billion bid from investors, including Elon Musk, to buyout OpenAI’s controlling nonprofit. DeepSeek’s impact goes beyond the guesswork of the value. The company has reversed the conventional wisdom on AI innovation, disrupting Silicon Valley’s primacy and fueling global shifts in AI power. It even spurred the biggest stock drop in Nvidia’s history, indicating the shift in the AI world. Liang Wenfeng builds an AI empire that challenges global markets Liang Wenfeng was born in 1985 in Zhanjiang, China, and graduated from Zhejiang University with a degree in electronic engineering before pursuing a master’s in information and communication engineering. Quantitative trading was his first career choice; he co-founded Zhejiang High-Flyer Asset Management, which at one point controlled $12 billion. Liang created DeepSeek in 2023 as an AI venture for his hedge fund, Zhejiang High-Flyer Asset Management, which Liang and two other engineers from Zhejiang University set up. The trio began trading as students during the global financial crisis. Despite the fact that the company is quite young, it has already been restricted by “hundreds” of companies, while governments from Australia to South Korea have also restricted access to government devices due to security concerns. When strategic investments start coming in from Chinese tech giants like Microsoft did with OpenAI, then DeepSeek’s value will be further solidified. According to Emanuel, even at what seems to be very high valuations, these investments could be very valuable in the long run. DeepSeek is currently an enigma, a company whose value is still unknown but one that has changed the AI investment landscape. The big question still remains: Will Liang Wenfeng keep on the path to becoming one of the richest people in the world, or will DeepSeek’s valuation be on the lower end of the estimate? Only time will tell.

This stance marks a notable shift from earlier considerations where the Federal Reserve had been exploring the potential of a digital dollar. No CBDC For The United States, Powell Confirms This declaration came during a recent Senate Banking Committee hearing on Tuesday when Powell responded to a direct question from Senator Bernie Moreno (R-OH). “Can I have your commitment that as long as you’re the chair of the Federal Reserve system, that we will never have a central bank digital currency?” Moreno asked. “Yes,” Powell responded. The Fed’s previous research on CBDCs aimed at understanding how such a currency might improve the current payment system’s efficiency and safety. Critics of CBDCs, including the Cato Institute’s Nicholas Anthony, have praised Powell’s commitment, citing potential risks to financial freedom, privacy, and market stability. Unlike decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, a CBDC would be government-issued and regulated, potentially leading to concerns over surveillance due to its trackable nature. This announcement comes at a time when several countries are actively experimenting with their own digital currencies. Notably, China’s digital yuan pilot started in 2020, with other nations like Russia, Turkey, and Japan also exploring similar initiatives. Republicans Stopping CBDCs Powell’s firm stance highlights a divergence in U.S. policy compared to these global trends, especially under the current U.S. administration led by President Trump. Senator Moreno specifically praised Powell’s stance since it meant the U.S. wouldn’t wind up “looking like China” in any way. The debate around CBDCs in the U.S. has seen significant political pushback, especially from Republican lawmakers who have called for bans on government-issued digital currencies. Last year, the House of Representatives passed a bil l from Congressman Tom Emmer to ban the Federal Reserve from issuing a CBDC. In his recent crypto executive order , President Donald Trump also prohibited Federal agencies from attempting to promote or issue a CBDC. Powell’s clear statement might provide some relief to those concerned about the implications of CBDCs on personal freedoms and privacy.

Under the Republican-led subcommittee's title ""A Golden Age of Digital Assets,"" the industry representatives showed up in the hearing with momentum at all levels of the federal government, including from the White House, whose crypto czar was the one to first utter the ""golden age"" phrase . Just over two years after the devastation of collapsing crypto lenders and the criminal implosion of FTX in 2022, the industry has proven its sharp recovery with a slate of lawmakers clearly on-board for the legislation the industry has been calling for. ""Under the Trump administration, we will course correct by creating a workable pathway for responsible digital asset companies to set up operations here in the United States,"" said Representative Bryan Steil, a Wisconsin Republican who chairs the subcommittee that's an offshoot of the House Financial Services Committee. Republicans on the panel decried the ""unpredictable and hostile approach"" to crypto of former President Joe Biden's administration (as Steil put it), with an executive branch that's already reversing some of those past policies at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Securities and Exchange Commission. But the holy grail for the industry is a wide-reaching bill like the one passed in the House in the previous session of Congress. ""There are many issues to debate over the next several years, but we need to move now and put that basic foundation in place,"" said Jonathan Jachym, a lawyer and global head of policy at U.S. exchange Kraken. Among the hearing's witnesses was Timothy Massad, a former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission when it first flagged bitcoin (BTC) as a commodity. He cautioned the lawmakers not to push too hard into the details as they craft their digital assets market-structure legislation, because he said the CFTC and the SEC are more expert in the minutiae it'll require, and the agency leaders should be the ones to work out the technical aspects. This was the first hearing of the digital assets panel during this new Congress, but other committees in both chambers have already been digging into crypto-heavy issues, such as debanking. Earlier on Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell agreed that debanking is a problem worth exploring , and he also agreed that the Fed wouldn't be chasing a central bank digital currency on his watch. While Republicans and the industry witnesses bashed the Biden administration's track record, Dems took the opportunity to criticize President Donald Trump for embracing crypto for his personal gain by backing memecoin $TRUMP, which they characterized as a ""crypto scam"" that presents a dangerous conflict and may violate the constitutional provision against federal officials seeking profit from their office.",Policy|U.S. Congress|House Financial Services Committee|Donald Trump|crypto legislation,EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|BTC|FIAT|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-11 23:23:43

Crytpo custodian BitGo is considering an IPO as soon as the second half of this year, joining a flood of companies in the sector anticipating more support for their plans from regulators. https://t.co/oxu8e9lSaL — Bloomberg (@business) February 11, 2025 Citing sources familiar with the matter, the company is in discussions with potential advisors to prepare for a public listing—a move that would mark a major milestone for a firm that has long been synonymous with institutional-grade cryptocurrency security. Founded in 2013, the firm is known for multi-signature and threshold signature technologies. BitGo serves more than 1,500 institutional clients across 50 countries. The firm’s services include regulated custody, trading, lending, and DeFi solutions, making it a critical infrastructure provider for the digital asset market. According to sources, an IPO would not only offer liquidity to early investors but also supply the company with fresh capital to expand its product offerings in a competitive sector. Optimism in the Crypto Industry The potential public debut comes amid a wave of optimism in the crypto industry, as a growing number of firms anticipate regulatory support for their listing plans. Recent developments suggest that regulators may adopt a more accommodating stance toward crypto companies, providing the kind of clarity that has been lacking in recent years. Industry analysts believe that an IPO from a well-established player like BitGo would signal maturity in the crypto market. As the company finalizes its discussions with advisors and prepares the necessary documentation, market participants are keenly anticipating further updates on the timing and valuation of the offering. BitGo Introduces Institutional Bitcoin Staking with Core DAO In a joint announcement on December 9, 2024, BitGo stated that it would be one of the first custodians to facilitate institutional access to dual staking with Core DAO, allowing clients to earn returns on their Bitcoin holdings. @BitGo has introduced institutional-grade Bitcoin staking through a partnership with @Coredao_Org , a layer-1 blockchain platform. #BitGo #CoreDAO https://t.co/PTFF8ynr2T — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 10, 2024 The staking mechanism enables institutions to maintain full custody of their assets, mitigating counterparty risks often associated with traditional staking methods. As BitGo moves toward a public listing, its success or failure could influence how other crypto firms approach capital markets. A strong debut might encourage more institutional investment, while challenges could highlight the hurdles the industry still faces. Either way, this IPO will be closely watched as a potential benchmark for crypto’s place in traditional finance.

Its aggressive token burn strategy, unique presale structure, and skyrocketing investor interest make it a must-watch.

The Tokyo-listed online mobile gaming firm intends to strengthen its position in cryptocurrency by using Bitcoin for blockchain staking. Gumi Joins Babylon Staking According to reports, the company’s board of directors approved the decision as part of its strategy to expand its blockchain node operation business. This move positions Gumi as a key player in Japan’s growing Web3 industry. Following this development, Gumi will become the first publicly listed Japanese company to serve as a validator in the Babylon staking protocol. This role will enable the company to earn rewards while contributing to blockchain security. In a statement, Gumi emphasized that the investment would help strengthen its blockchain operations and increase its influence in the Web3 space. The company also confirmed that it would closely monitor its Bitcoin holdings and update its financial records accordingly. “ Through this initiative, we aim to further strengthen our node operation business and enhance our presence in the Web3 domain,” Gumi stated. Interestingly, Gumi’s stock price rose following the announcement. According to Google Finance data, its shares increased by 3.6%, reaching ¥454 (about $3) after the news broke. Asian Companies Continue to Adopt Bitcoin Gumi’s decision reiterates a growing trend of Asian businesses investing in cryptocurrency. In December 2024, Japanese energy and consulting firm Remixpoint added $1.38 million worth of Bitcoin to its portfolio, increasing its total crypto holdings to $27.59 million. Meanwhile, Tokyo-listed Metaplanet saw a sharp rise in its stock value after adopting a Bitcoin standard in April 2024. The company now aims to acquire 21,000 BTC by 2026. Expanding Institutional Cryptocurrency Network Amid Regulatory Actions Notably, as more entities explore Bitcoin and blockchain staking, institutional interest in cryptocurrency is rising in Japan. Gumi’s latest move reveals its confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential and the broader Web3 industry. At the same time, Japan is tightening regulations on unregistered crypto exchanges. Last week, Apple removed crypto trading apps like Bybit, Bitget, MEXC, KuCoin, and Bitcastle from its Japan store. This action followed multiple warnings from Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA), urging these platforms to comply with local regulations or leave the market.

Save More with Web3Bay’s Crypto Payments Thinking of crypto payments only in terms of trading? Time to reconsider. Web3Bay is transforming online purchasing with its Web3 payment system. Here, users enjoy speedy transactions and no hidden fees, alongside exclusive discounts when using cryptocurrencies such as XRP, BNB, or other supported coins. This means more of your money is spent on your actual purchases rather than going to intermediaries. Moreover, Web3Bay’s presale is drawing interest due to its accessible starting price and potential for substantial returns. The platform has already secured over $1.1 million, pricing its 3BAY token at just $0.004562 in the fourth presale stage. With plans to launch the token at $0.1959, early backers could see significant gains once it begins trading. Unlike traditional e-commerce sites that take a portion of every sale, Web3Bay’s approach rewards its users, allowing them to keep more of their money. The evolution towards Web3 payments is making conventional shopping seem outdated. Web3Bay offers consumers direct control over their finances, bypassing traditional banks and payment processors. The possibility of paying with major cryptocurrencies like XRP while enjoying discounts and seamless transactions places Web3Bay in a favorable position. As the platform expands, early adopters are set to benefit the most, leaving those who stick with old methods paying more at traditional outlets. XRP Crypto: Solid Market Performance with Practical Use XRP is not just for trading anymore. Currently priced at around $2.98, XRP has experienced significant growth, driven by positive expectations regarding regulatory outcomes and broader adoption. Some experts anticipate its value could reach between $5 and $7, with more optimistic projections suggesting it could surpass $10. The excitement surrounding Ripple’s developments and the increasing demand for quick, cost-effective blockchain solutions have made XRP a hot topic in the financial community. Moreover, XRP excels in Web3 payment applications. Thanks to its fast transaction times and minimal fees, it’s perfect for use on platforms like Web3Bay, where users can complete payments instantly without any deductions from intermediaries. As Web3 payments gain traction, the practical applications for XRP are expected to expand, benefiting those who invest early. Binance Coin: A Valuable Payment and Utility Asset Binance Coin (BNB) maintains its status as a leading cryptocurrency, with its current trading price near $670. Despite some price volatility, it continues to be a preferred choice for transactions on the Binance exchange and beyond. Binance’s strategy of burning tokens to reduce supply, along with new features on the BNB Chain introduced by PancakeSwap, keeps the demand for BNB robust. In December 2024, it reached a peak of $794, indicating its potential for future growth. BNB also plays a crucial role in Web3 payments. On platforms like Web3Bay, users benefit from Binance Coin and XRP for fast, fee-free transactions. As more online retailers adopt cryptocurrency payments, BNB’s advantages in reducing costs and speeding up transactions make it an appealing option for digital shoppers. Wrapping Up Both XRP and Binance Coin (BNB) are proving their worth beyond mere trading. XRP is becoming popular as an efficient, affordable option for transactions, with future price potential ranging from $5 to $10. Binance Coin is also asserting its utility, currently valued at around $670, supported by ongoing demand due to Binance’s strategic token burns and ecosystem enhancements. The real transformation is occurring in Web3 payments . Web3Bay illustrates how cryptocurrencies can extend beyond asset holding — they can also streamline purchasing, eliminate hidden costs, and enable immediate transactions. With the 3BAY token presale ongoing, early participants are poised to gain the most before the platform fully launches.

Currently, DOT’s price is $4.61, with predictions ranging from $4.81 to $18.01 for 2025. On the other hand, LINK stands at $18.96, with forecasts suggesting a rise to between $25 and $100, influenced by DeFi integration and large-scale purchases. Both are garnering interest, yet there’s another exciting option available. BlockDAG (BDAG) introduces a straightforward method to profit from crypto. Skip the trading and mining—BlockDAG’s affiliate program instantly pays 5% USDT cashback for each referral purchase.

Predicting Polkadot’s Future: Upcoming DOT Price Ranges Polkadot is now priced at $4.61, experiencing some resistance as the market anticipates its next direction. Analysts predict a DOT price range from $4.81 to $18.01 by 2025, influenced by adoption rates and general market trends. While its short-term path is unclear, DOT’s significance in enabling multichain interoperability keeps it central in the crypto dialogue. Looking ahead, DOT might challenge the $14.04 mark as a crucial resistance point, with potential to reach up to $18.01 if positive momentum continues. The trajectory largely hinges on the expansion of Polkadot’s ecosystem and market confidence. As traders ponder DOT’s potential, platforms like BlockDAG are drawing interest by offering passive rewards, presenting an alternative to price-dependent strategies. For now, the focus remains on identifying DOT’s next significant movement. Chainlink’s Future Trajectory: Updated Price Insights Chainlink is trading at $18.96 and currently under scrutiny as significant holders recently sold off 23 million LINK tokens, totaling about $455 million. Despite these sales, signs of accumulation are visible, with declining LINK balances on exchanges suggesting potential price resilience. Analysts are split on Chainlink’s future, estimating a 2025 price range from $25 to $100, dictated by its adoption in the DeFi sector. Long-term outlooks are more optimistic, with predictions for 2030 ranging from $48 to $100, assuming Chainlink continues leading as a trusted oracle provider. Short-term price movements will depend on overall market dynamics and the demand for its technology. While the market awaits a definitive trend, those seeking simpler gains are exploring BlockDAG, known for its direct rewards rather than speculative investment. The Bottom Line Current forecasts place Polkadot’s DOT price between $4.81 and $18.01, whereas Chainlink’s potential shift for 2025 could span from $25 to $100. Both projects maintain solid fundamentals, yet their future prices are not guaranteed. As traders monitor the movements of DOT and LINK, BlockDAG presents a distinctive offering—immediate rewards without relying on market fluctuations. BlockDAG’s affiliate scheme allows users to earn directly from crypto without the need to trade or mine. Each referral results in a 5% instant USDT cashback (BEP-20), with no ceiling on potential earnings.

This development is outlined in the 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which reveal the firm’s escalated commitment to digital asset investments. Goldman Sachs Expands Crypto Portfolio, Adds $1.5B in Bitcoin ETFs According to a recent SEC filing , Goldman Sachs has significantly increased its investments in Bitcoin ETFs. The report details an 88% increase in the firm’s holdings in the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), bringing its investment to $1.27 billion. This uptick is part of a broader strategy by Goldman Sachs to deepen its footprint in the digital assets space. The filing also highlights a substantial growth in Goldman’s holdings of the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), with a 105% increase compared to the previous quarter. This growth has boosted the FBTC position to a value of $288 million. These developments reflect a confident move by the bank to leverage the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies. In addition to these holdings, Goldman Sachs CEO, David Solomon, recently dismissed Bitcoin as a threat to the US dollar’s dominance. He reiterated that Bitcoin remains a speculative asset, emphasizing its volatility and uncertain regulatory landscape. Regulatory Filings Illuminate Investment Trends Goldman Sachs’ latest 13F filings provide a window into the firm’s investment tactics. The filings reveal a strategic embrace of Bitcoin ETFs among its asset management practices. These filings are mandatory for institutional investment managers with equity assets over $100 million, offering a periodic overview of their holdings. Goldman’s increasing investments in BTC ETFs coincide with the ongoing development of regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies. This trend suggests a strong institutional belief in the long-term viability of digital assets. The firm’s strategic positioning also includes the use of derivatives such as calls and puts, showcasing a refined strategy for managing crypto exposure. Market Implications of Crypto Strategy Goldman Sachs’ diversified approach to its digital asset portfolio enhances its market standing and sets a benchmark for other institutional investors considering crypto expansions. More so, CEO David Solomon has outlined conditions for Goldman Sachs to expand into crypto markets . He stressed the need for regulatory changes. Solomon confirmed the firm has built infrastructure around digital assets. However, legal constraints block direct trading of Bitcoin and Ethereum. In related news, the US SEC is actively reviewing BlackRock’s proposal for in-kind Bitcoin ETF redemptions, which could enhance market liquidity and reduce transaction costs. If approved, this change would allow authorized participants to receive Bitcoin directly instead of cash during redemptions.

Despite this, onchain signs of Shiba Inu whale return signal positive long-term prospects for the memecoin. At the time of writing, the SHIB price changed hands for $0.00001574, which was down marginally by 0.54% in 24 hours. With the whale swooping in, the token might be setting the pace for a new rally. Shiba Inu Whales Might Make the Difference According to data insight from IntoTheBlock, Shiba Inu whale transactions have jumped by 20.69% in 24 hours. Based on this rally, the large transactions amount to $26.66 million within the time under review. Per the data, 80 SHIB whale transactions have been registered over 24 hours. This figure marks an average from the weekly low of 42 transactions and a high of 185. Per volume, more than 1.69 trillion SHIB tokens were moved by the traders initiating the large transactions. While the 7-day high stood at 5.84 trillion SHIB, the lowest recorded figure comes in at 890.85 billion SHIB. Shiba Inu Whale Transactions. Source: IntoTheBlock It is worth noting that these whale transactions mark those worth at least $100,000. As spotted onchain, a SHIB whale moved over 3 trillion tokens a few days ago, sparking speculations. At a time when the price of Shiba Inu needs a viable anchor, massive shifts by SHIB whales might reshape sentiment. Shiba Inu Growing Footprint Despite ranking as the second-largest memecoin in the Web3 space, Shiba Inu has a bigger community of builders. Through Shibarium, the token has continued to expand its footprint. As reported recently, the token expanded to UAE , partnering with the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure (MoEI). This collaboration helped expand the SHIB footprint and utilize its ShibOS to enhance the MoEI digital operations. In addition, the developer team is integrating new solutions like the Full Homorphobic Encryption (FHE) designed for privacy. This ecosystem push bordering on every aspect of its operations is pushing Shiba Inu as an attractive token to whales. If the trend is sustained, the token may reclaim its 30-day high of $0.00002488. SHIB Rally Is Imminent Beyond the push to reclaim its 30-day high, SHIB price is billed for an imminent rally. With memecoins like Dogecoin, BONK, and TRUMP Leverage ETF applications now filed by asset managers, Shiba Inu may also join the list. Should this happen, it might set off SHIB as a mature token for institutional investors to gain more exposure. Ultimately, Shiba Inu has crucial dormant triggers that might set it apart in the coming weeks when activated.

The reserve will support major digital assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum while also helping the platform manage market risks. World Liberty Financial Launches Macro Strategic Reserve The Macro Strategy reserve is designed to provide financial stability for WLFI by diversifying its holdings across multiple digital assets. The initiative aims to mitigate market volatility and enhance the platform’s long-term sustainability. According to a statement posted on X , WLFI described the reserve as a way to create a “robust financial backbone” for the platform. The company believes this move will not only secure its ecosystem but also enable future investments in innovative blockchain projects. WLFI has been actively expanding its cryptocurrency portfolio since its launch in October 2024, with recent investments in Ethereum (ETH), Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), Ondo (ONDO), Chainlink (LINK), and USD Coin (USDC). The Macro Strategy reserve will be used to strengthen these holdings while also exploring new opportunities in the market. Collaboration with Financial Institutions The company is engaging with financial institutions to contribute tokenized assets to the reserve. According to WLFI, the contributed assets will be stored in publicly accessible wallets, allowing institutions to gain transparent exposure to the crypto market. A blog post released on Tuesday stated that WLFI is in discussions with several firms about integrating Ondo Finance’s tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) into its treasury reserves sparking a ONDO price surge . These include Short-Term U.S. Government Treasuries (OUSG) and U.S. Dollar Yield (USDY) tokens. This collaboration is part of WLFI’s broader goal to connect traditional finance with decentralized finance (DeFi). The company believes that by working with financial institutions, it can help bring traditional assets on-chain and increase the adoption of tokenized investments. Market Activity and Recent Developments WLFI has been on a crypto buying spree in recent months. However, the company’s token holdings recently dropped from over $360 million to approximately $38 million, following a series of transactions that sent assets to exchanges. The reason behind these transfers has not been publicly disclosed. Despite this, WLFI continues to position itself as a major player in the DeFi sector. The company’s ties to former U.S. President Donald Trump have sparked discussions about potential conflicts of interest, but WLFI has not directly addressed these concerns. Concurrently, the World Liberty Financial has purchased 1,917 ETH ($5 million) and 830,469 MOVE tokens ($470,000), according to blockchain data tracker. This follows a pattern of frequent acquisitions as WLFI expands its investment strategy. Amid this announcement, the WLFI has invited its community to participate in discussions about the Macro Strategy reserve through its governance forum with a promise of a detailed proposal outlining the reserve’s structure and objectives hence allowing stakeholders to provide feedback.

A major crypto analyst, Arthur Hayes has warned traders to be aware of an incoming loss. While Bitcoin price is having a hard time growing, a new altcoin called RCOF is gaining a lot of attention. Experts believe its value has the potential to soar by over 50,000%. Smart investors are changing their focus to the next big opportunity. Let’s explore what’s driving this trend to the new altcoin and why traders are after the coin. Bitcoin Experiences Negative Price Predictions As Negative Market Sentiments Prevail Arthur Hayes, co-founder and former CEO of BitMEX believes that Bitcoin (BTC) could test prices between $70,000 and $75,000 in the next few months. In a blog post called “The Genie” on February 6, he mentioned that the ongoing political situation in America, even after Donald Trump was elected, might lead to a price drop similar to what was seen in late 2024. In October, Bitcoin was priced between $60,000 and $72,000. After Trump won the election in early November, excitement grew about a Bitcoin reserve, pushing the price above $100,000 in just 40 days. Currently, Bitcoin price is at around $95,960, but Arthur Hayes’ cautious view has surprised some people, especially since the market is currently stable. Bitcoin price is currently at about $95,960 , which is a drop of about 0.38%, but generally, Bitcoin price has been bullish over the past month. In response to the warning given by Arthur Hayes, some BTC investors have joined the RCO Finance presale in search of better pastures. RCO Finance (RCOF): The New Altcoin That is Always Green on The Market RCO Finance is a major game changer for decentralized finance in the crypto market. This new AI Altcoin is quickly taking attention from Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency in the market, as it maintains its price surge in the midst of market volatility. At the center of this AI Altcoin’s transformation is its main feature, an AI-powered Robo Advisor that eliminates the risk of investing. It includes machine learning capabilities, real-time market analysis, and automated trade executions, offering customers a significant advantage in the volatile cryptocurrency market. Imagine seeing the next big altcoin before it skyrockets. That’s exactly what the Robo Advisor does. It monitors top financial sources, including Bloomberg, Reuters, and on-chain analytics for early signs of breakout coins. For example, if you had this technology, it would have predicted the TRUMP token before it surged 100 times, putting you ahead of the competition. You should also be informed that the RCOF team is constantly working to provide upgrades to the Robo Advisor so as to ensure optimal performance. RCOF also allows you to rebalance your portfolio as needed, ensuring diversity across over 120,000 investment possibilities, including equities, ETFs, bonds, and tokenized assets, all on the same platform and without KYC verification. Additionally, RCOF’s debit cards allow investors to easily spend crypto assets in the real world. The ecosystem also facilitates fractional ownership through tokenization, allowing access to high-value investments such as real estate, equities, and commodities. The RCO Finance project has already deployed its new Beta Platform before the presale period closes, demonstrating its dedication to genuine utility. With over 10,000 people now on board, the Beta is continually gathering feedback to improve the AI’s performance. Join The RCOF Public Presale To Boost Your Portfolio The RCOF public presale is now in its 5th stage, with tokens priced at $0.100000. When it moves on to the next presale stage, the price will increase to $0.13000, meaning early investors would make a quick 30% profit automatically. Over $13.2 million has been raised, obviously pointing out that there’s trader excitement about it. In a bid to build investors’ trust, RCOF token’s smart contracts have passed a thorough audit by SolidProof , a well-known blockchain security company. This validation shows that RCOF is committed to offering a safe and trustworthy trading tool in the DeFi space. Joining the RCOF public presale is a wise decision that will speak in a short while from now. With BTC investors seeking shelter due to Arthur Hayes prediction of Bitcoin price, RCOF has appeared as a knight in shiny armor to save the day. Buy the RCOF token and increase your chances of being the next crypto billionaire!

Bill Barhydt says that economic policies under US President Donald Trump may inject a huge amount of liquidity into the markets causing crypto assets to soar to astronomical prices. Among his issued “base case” price targets for digital assets in the current cycle is that Bitcoin may increase by more than 259% from its current value. He also says that Ethereum ( ETH ) may increase by more than 200% from its current value. Meanwhile, he says Solana ( SOL ) may increase by at least 350% from its current value and Sui ( SUI ) may increase by more than 676% from its current value. “My base case for for current crypto cycle: Bitcoin: $350,000. Ethereum: $8,000. Solana: $900. Sui: $25. The high end of range is ~2x these values. My model is simple. This administration wants interest rates much lower and they’ll do whatever they have to to achieve that. They also need to refinance over $7 trillion in debt. Tax cuts are coming. All of this equates to a massive liquidity injection whether via QE (quantitative easing) or some other means.” He believes that market liquidity will start increasing within the first quarter of this year. Bitcoin is trading for $97,449 at time of writing, up 1.7% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, Ethereum is trading for $2,662 at time of writing, up 1.5% on the day. ETH competitor Solana is trading for $200 at time of writing, up 1.3% in the last 24 hours, while SOL rival Sui is trading for $3.22 at time of writing, up 8.8% on the day. In April of 2024, Barhydt issued another big crypto outlook when he said the digital asset market capitalization has the potential to increase to $50 trillion within a decade due to the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs).

OFFICIALMAGACOIN is that opportunity today, with predictions that it could become the next $2.5 million crypto sensation. >>> PRESALE LIVE NOW – LIMITED SPOTS! Why OFFICIALMAGACOIN Stands Out Having raised over $1.5 million during its presale, OFFICIALMAGACOIN is quickly building momentum. With a price under $0.20, the potential for massive returns has both retail and institutional investors flocking to secure their share. Let’s explore what makes OFFICIALMAGACOIN unique and how it stacks up against established players like Ethereum (ETH), Chainlink (LINK), Sei (SEI), and Bitcoin (BTC). 1. Rapid Investor ConfidenceOFFICIALMAGACOIN’s presale raised $1.5 million in record time, signaling strong confidence from early adopters. The combination of retail enthusiasm and growing institutional interest makes this coin a standout in the crowded crypto market. 2. Potential for Massive GrowthCrypto experts believe OFFICIALMAGACOIN could follow the trajectory of Bitcoin and Ethereum, offering exponential returns. With its low entry price and the scarcity created by exclusive distribution, the coin is primed for a rapid rise in value. >>>>>> PRESALE SELLING OUT – CLICK HERE TO SECURE YOUR SPOT! Comparing OFFICIALMAGACOIN to ETH, LINK, SEI, and BTC Ethereum (ETH): While ETH has revolutionized the crypto space, its maturity limits further exponential growth. Chainlink (LINK): A critical infrastructure coin, but focused more on utility than explosive price movement. Sei (SEI): A promising newcomer, but it lacks the excitement and exclusivity that OFFICIALMAGACOIN delivers. Bitcoin (BTC): The gold standard of crypto, but its early-stage growth potential is long gone. The Future Is OFFICIALMAGACOIN With its strong market momentum, low price, and massive growth potential, OFFICIALMAGACOIN is shaping up to be the investment of the year.

XRP’s price hit $3.03, showing increased interest from big investors, with ongoing ETF applications and a positive turn in the SEC’s attitude toward its new leaders. Despite facing international regulatory pressures, Binance Coin (BNB) continues to perform well, trading at $673.09. While the Web3 ecosystem keeps growing, most projects are still centrally managed—except for one. Web3Bay offers more than just a presale; it’s a marketplace owned by its users, where 3BAY holders make key decisions. Unlike Binance and XRP, which have closed-door governance, Web3Bay empowers its participants. Early joiners don’t just purchase tokens; they gain influence in shaping the future of decentralized online commerce. Web3Bay: Transforming Purchasers into Powerholders Traditional online marketplaces charge fees, impose rules, and make decisions in secrecy. Web3Bay changes this dynamic. Here, 3BAY token holders shape the platform’s growth, from policy settings to feature updates. Unlike Ripple XRP, which is controlled by a select few, Web3Bay places authority in the users’ hands. Owning tokens here means more than trading—they signify ownership and influence in the marketplace. The Web3Bay presale is heating up, with over $1.1 million raised and more than 295 million 3BAY tokens sold. Prices start at just $0.004562625 and are set to climb with each sale phase. Early investors secure tokens at far below the expected launch price of $0.1959. Holding 3BAY is not only about potential financial gains—it also includes governance rights, special discounts, and a say in platform decisions. The clock is ticking. Web3Bay is not just another presale; it’s a unique chance to shape a decentralized marketplace from the ground up. With each stage, prices increase, and those hesitating might end up paying much more. As the Web3 ecosystem moves toward decentralization, Web3Bay is at the forefront, offering its early supporters a role in governance. Join now to become a key player. Ripple XRP’s Major Advances: ETF Aspirations and Shifting Regulations Ripple XRP is advancing with fresh vigor, currently priced at $3.03 amid increasing institutional interest. The significant development? Organizations like Grayscale are striving to convert their XRP Trust into a spot XRP ETF, which could heighten mainstream acceptance. At the same time, Canada’s Purpose Investments is preparing to launch its own XRP ETF, aiming to be first on the market before the U.S. sanctions similar ventures. The future of XRP heavily depends on the swift approval of these ETFs by regulators. Simultaneously, Ripple XRP’s ongoing legal issues might be seeing a positive turn. With Paul Atkins at the helm of the SEC, a more crypto-friendly regulatory stance could emerge. If policies shift in Ripple’s favor, it might dismantle the primary obstacle hindering XRP’s progress. The focus now rests on regulatory decisions that could reshape the landscape. Binance Coin Endures Regulatory Focus but Keeps Market Lead Binance Coin (BNB) remains robust at $673.09, despite increased regulatory scrutiny. French authorities have initiated an investigation into Binance for alleged money laundering and tax evasion from 2019 to 2024. Despite these challenges, Binance upholds its position as the leading crypto exchange, boasting 245 million users and a daily trading volume of $14 billion. Its substantial liquidity and competitive fees continue to make it a preferred choice among traders. Contrary to Ripple XRP, whose regulatory uncertainties have impeded its progress, Binance is broadening its services. The exchange recently introduced the VVVUSDT Perpetual Contract, which allows up to 25x leverage on the Venice Token (VVV). Although legal concerns persist, Binance’s market influence remains unshaken. The ongoing question is how regulatory pressures might affect its long-term expansion. The Bottom Line Both Binance Coin (BNB) and Ripple XRP are navigating significant changes. Ripple XRP is building momentum with ETF applications and favorable regulatory shifts, potentially opening new doors. Meanwhile, Binance Coin continues to rule the exchange scene, even amidst legal scrutiny in France. These entities play crucial roles, yet their decisions are made away from public scrutiny, leaving users with limited control. This is where Web3Bay steps in, revolutionizing control by empowering its users. Web3Bay allows 3BAY holders to mold the platform’s future, vote on policies, and directly reap the benefits of its growth. As the presale price increases with each phase, early investors do more than buy tokens—they gain a stake in directing the Web3 ecosystem . This isn’t just another investment; it’s an opportunity to lead.

By 2028, FLOW could reach a maximum price of $2.37. In 2031, FLOW will range between $6 to $7.62. Flow coin, the native token of the Flow blockchain created by Dapper Labs, is essential for powering decentralized applications (dApps) and digital assets. Flow aims to provide a high-performance, user-friendly platform that tackles scalability without sacrificing decentralization. Its unique architecture allows developers to build secure and efficient smart contracts. FLOW, its native token, has several key uses within the ecosystem, including paying transaction fees, staking, and participating in network governance. The growing number of dApps and users on the platform drives demand for Flow coin, influencing FLOW’s price movements. Given Flow coin’s strong fundamentals and growing support levels in the ecosystem, the question arises: how high can FLOW go? What will FLOW price be in 2025? Overview Cryptocurrency Flow Token FLOW Price $0.504 Market Cap $800,213,892.21 Trading Volume $32,273,979.66 Circulating Supply 1,562,246,493.58 FLOW All-time High $46.16 Apr 05, 2021 All-time Low $0.3921 Sep 12, 2023 24-hour High $0.5345 24-hour Low $0.503 Flow coin technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 17.88% 50-Day SMA $0.705 14-Day RSI 28.34 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 44 (Fear) Green Days 15/30 (50%) 200-Day SMA $0.661 Flow price analysis: FLOW makes a slight recovery, but resistance lies at $0.515 TL;DR Breakdown The broader market outlook for FLOW is bearish. However, the coin has seen some recovery, making attempts to break past $0.515. Flow is below the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level. Flow coin 1-day price analysis: FLOW sees slight buying pressure amid broader bearish trend FLOW’s price analysis for February 12 shows that the coin is in a downtrend and below the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level. Resistance levels stand at $0.579 and $0.727. Flow coin remains under the middle Bollinger Bands, suggesting weak momentum. FLOW sees slight buying pressure amid broader bearish trend On the other hand, the MACD indicator shows slight buying pressure, with the MACD line trading above the signal line. A break above $0.579 could push FLOW towards $0.727 or higher. In the bearish case, FLOW might retest support at $0.416. Flow coin 4-hour price analysis: FLOW faces resistance at $0.515 Flow coin shows some recovery on the 4-hour chart but is struggling to break above resistance at $0.515. The coin’s immediate support is present at $0.500. FLOW faces resistance at $0.515 The Community Channel Index’s value (78.79) indicates that FLOW is slightly overbought, and a short-term pullback could ensue. The Chaikin Money Flow’s value, at 0, indicates relative buying and selling pressure with no clear direction. FLOW needs to break past immediate resistance to confirm an uptrend. FLOW technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.5782 SELL SMA 5 $0.5464 SELL SMA 10 $0.5841 SELL SMA 21 $0.6352 SELL SMA 50 $0.7058 SELL SMA 100 $0.7476 SELL SMA 200 $0.6610 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 0.6304 SELL EMA 5 $ 0.6644 SELL EMA 10 $ 0.7021 SELL EMA 21 $ 0.7385 SELL EMA 50 $ 0.7692 SELL EMA 100 $ 0.7448 SELL EMA 200 $ 0.7263 SELL What to expect from Flow? While the broader sentiment for FLOW is negative, the short-term momentum indicates a recovery, although weak. The coin must clear resistance at $0.564 to confirm a sustained recovery. If this does not happen, traders should look out for a price consolidation or further downside below $0.491. Is FLOW a good investment? Flow coin has potential as an investment due to its strong partnerships with major brands and its focus on powering decentralized applications, especially in the NFT and gaming spaces. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it carries significant volatility and risks, so investors should carefully consider market conditions and risk tolerance before investing. Why is Flow price dropping? Flow price history Flow is range-bound, attributable to an equilibrium between buyers’ and sellers’ pressure. At the moment, there are no clear directions. Will FLOW recover? FLOW can potentially recover if it can break through resistance levels and maintain momentum. The market’s current consolidation phase suggests a possible breakout, which could either see selling pressure and drive prices higher or lead to further declines. Close monitoring is crucial as market dynamics remain volatile. Will FLOW reach $1? The $1 price mark is within range, having reached that level in early December 2024. Renewed buyer interest in the coming weeks will surely push FLOW to $1 and above. Will FLOW reach $5? This level has not been achieved since February 2022. For FLOW to recapture the $5 levels, significant cash inflows will be required. Can FLOW reach $50? FLOW has previously reached an all-time high (ATH) of $46.16, so reaching $50 is definitely achievable. However, a significant bull run and tangible ecosystem updates are required to achieve this feat, as the coin is currently 98% below its ATH. Is Flow a good blockchain? Flow is a solid blockchain, especially for gaming and NFTs. It is designed for scalability, fast transactions, and low fees. The network’s unique multi-role architecture improves efficiency without compromising decentralization. However, it faces fierce competition, and adoption levels are not as high as those of Ethereum and Solana. Does FLOW have a good long-term future?

Hester Peirce (also known as ‘Crypto Mom’), one of the agency’s longest-serving commissioners and its most outspoken crypto advocate, confirmed on Tuesday that the SEC will no longer use enforcement actions as a substitute for regulatory policy. “During the past several years, enforcement cases have been used as a way to make regulatory policy; that is very atypical,” Peirce said in a live interview on Bloomberg’s Crypto TV segment on Tuesday. “We’re trying to get back to a path where we’re really using our other tools to make policy.” This comes less than a day after the SEC asked a federal court to pause its lawsuit against Binance for 60 days. The regulator sued Binance and its co-founder, Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao, in 2023, accusing them of mishandling customer funds, misleading investors, and violating US securities laws. The SEC’s legal team told the court on Monday that a new regulatory framework is being developed and that ongoing cases may need to be reconsidered. Notably, Peirce refused to say whether the SEC would drop the Binance lawsuit entirely, and also declined to comment on whether other lawsuits, including the one against Coinbase Global, could be dismissed. “It’s facts and circumstances,” she said . “We’ll have to look at each case on its merits as we go forward.” Two days after his inauguration, president Trump signed an executive order creating a special advisory group on crypto policy and a national digital asset stockpile. His administration is also considering a national bitcoin strategic reserve. SEC ends its war on crypto “We have been using enforcement cases to set regulatory policy,” Peirce said in her interview. “We’re trying to shift that so we actually set policy and then we bring enforcement cases as needed.” The question of who should regulate crypto—the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)—has been debated for years. Peirce says the SEC is currently reviewing its jurisdiction and will flag regulatory gaps for Congress to address. In her words: “We’re working on looking at our jurisdiction that we currently have and saying what falls inside that jurisdiction and what falls outside that jurisdiction, then we can point out to Congress where we think there are gaps where maybe something is not covered by our jurisdiction.” Crypto registration, Bitcoin ETFs, meme coins, and the future of the SEC For so long, crypto companies struggled to register with the SEC as the agency, along with the Federal Reserve, made it impossible for banks to even dabble with the industry. Peirce says the agency is now actively fixing that problem. “We’ve just put roadblock after roadblock up against people who are trying to come in and talk to us as we’ve asked them to do or come in and register as we’ve asked them to do and so all I’m asking is that we have an innovation policy that allows people to innovate and that allows people to try new things,” says Perice. Right now, the SEC is processing applications for exemptive relief, which would allow crypto companies to bypass outdated financial rules that were written long before digital assets existed. “We’re looking at all kinds of different adjustments that need to be made,” Peirce said. Also, as Cryptopolitan reported just yesterday, Fed chair Jerome Powell has also said that he would be looking into crypto debanking and hopefully fix the whole situation. Meanwhile, the SEC is also reviewing the classification of crypto trading platforms. Peirce says the SEC’s first step is to determine whether a trading platform deals in securities. If it does, it will be required to register. If it doesn’t, the SEC will back off. Peirce, who has been a longtime supporter of Bitcoin ETFs, also confirmed that the agency is actively reviewing all new ETF applications, particularly those of XRP, Solana, Litecoin, and Dogecoin. Trump’s personal involvement in crypto has of course raised new regulatory questions. Peirce was asked whether the President and First Lady launching their own meme coins makes the SEC’s job more complicated. She refused to comment directly on the matter but did acknowledge that many meme coins may not fall under the SEC’s jurisdiction. “Many of these meme coins probably do not have a home under the SEC’s current regulations.” If Congress or the CFTC wants to regulate them instead, Peirce says, “that’s their call.” Meanwhile, the SEC itself is shrinking. The agency recently extended a deferred resignation program allowing staff to leave voluntarily. Peirce wouldn’t say how many employees had accepted the offer but confirmed that the agency is downsizing and restructuring. “We’re always thinking about how we can do our jobs more efficiently and effectively,” was all she said. Peirce was also asked whether the SEC is overstaffed as Elon Musk’s D.O.G.E department goes on a spending cut rampage. Peirce explained subtly that the SEC will always need enforcement teams, but now those teams will be focused on legitimate violations instead of trying to regulate crypto through lawsuits, so Elon doesn’t have to worry about them.

Major crypto centralized exchanges witnessed a 25% drop in spot trading volume in January 2025 compared to the figures recorded in December 2024. Data collected and compiled by a WuBlockchain team shows that the top three exchanges in terms of change rate were HTX with a negative 8%, Kraken with a negative 10%, and Bybit with a negative 11%. The exchanges that trailed behind claimed the bottom three spots: Bitget, with negative 46%; Kucoin, with negative 41%; and Mexc, with negative 36%. Binance leads CEXs with the highest spot trading volume A chart shared in the report shows that Binance recorded the largest volume in both December last year and January 2025.

The office, which was created by president Donald Trump, is tracking government workers making a few hundred thousand dollars but somehow sitting on tens of millions. “We find it sort of rather odd that there are quite a few people in the bureaucracy who have a salary of a few hundred thousand dollars but somehow manage to accrue tens of millions of dollars in net worth,” Elon said from the Oval today. “We’re just curious as to where it came from.” Federal agencies forced to cooperate with Elon Trump has ordered federal agencies to cooperate with D.O.G.E to drastically reduce the size of the federal workforce, according to a White House fact sheet released today. The plan limits agencies to hiring one new employee for every four that leave, except in law enforcement, national security, immigration, and public safety. document.createElement('video'); https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/qSVcrbIcVyRsrmff.mp4 As you can see in the video above, Elon made a rare appearance in the Oval alongside self-proclaimed best buddy Trump to defend D.O.G.E’s strategy. His approach has of course been to deploy young investigators across federal agencies, comb through payroll systems, track employee assets, and—when necessary—shut down entire offices. Trump said D.O.G.E had already uncovered “billions and billions of dollars in waste, fraud, and abuse.” No direct evidence was provided, but Elon claimed that Treasury Department systems lacked basic safeguards to stop payments to banned entities. “It’s like just a massive number of blank checks just flying out of the building,” Elon told reporters. The eccentric billionaire has also been posting cases of fraud on X, exposing major inefficiencies in federal spending. He admitted that some of his claims could be incorrect but said they should just be fact-checked and corrected if that’s the case then. “Trust me, I want to be wrong. I want it proven to me that the scale of corruption I have discovered is, you know, inaccurate,” said Elon. Federal workers face uncertain future Trump has vowed to push D.O.G.E’s findings through Congress if necessary. He also blasted federal judges for blocking some of his government overhaul efforts but said he would “abide by the courts.” Elon Musk with his kid, X, at the Oval with president Trump Meanwhile, a federal judge in Rhode Island ruled that the White House had not fully complied with an order to release billions in federal grant money. For employees resisting the buyout plan, the situation is uncertain. Government reduction-in-force regulations allow laid-off federal workers to receive up to one year’s salary in severance, depending on age and years of service. Some workers may be reassigned, while others could face immediate dismissal, Elon told the reporters. Newly-appointed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has stuck by Elon’s side, saying he agrees completely with everything he’s doing and is aligning all his missions at the Treasury with those of D.O.G.E. Ken Griffin, founder of Citadel, also praised Elon’s efforts to curb government waste but took a swipe at Trump’s trade policies. “He will do what it takes to win,” Griffin said about Elon at the UBS Financial Services Conference in Miami today. “Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for making sure my tax dollars are spent effectively.” Elon’s aggressive tactics aren’t surprising. He has a long history of cutting jobs fast without warning, and this guy calls himself an “efficiency freak.” At Tesla, Elon laid off 9% of the workforce in 2018, and in 2023, it was around 22%, with termination emails sent out at 2 in the morning. When he took over Twitter (now X) in 2022, Elon fired 80% of the staff—about 6,000 employees.

Though the cryptosphere at large has been inundated with politics as of late (with resultant meager coverage of tech), several important smart contract upgrades to the Bitcoin Cash network are set to go live in May. Bitcoin Cash supporters have been busy buying up so-called “Velma” non-fungible tokens (NFTs) this year, in order to attend the the BCH Bliss 2025 conference, in Ljubljana, Slovenia. The name “Velma” is a phonetic nod to the features of the coming May 2025 upgrade, which deals with Virtual Machine Limits (VML). 2024’s upgrade, which implemented an “Adaptive Blocksize Limit Algorithm,” was playfully meme’d into the attractive, yet non-existent celeb called “Jessica ABLA.” Velma NFTs on Tapswap.cash. BCH Bliss 2025 to focus on Velma upgrade, adoption As reported previously, the Velma upgrade use cases, according to Bitcoin Cash devs, include: “…more advanced automated market making and exchange protocols, decentralized stablecoins, collateralized loan protocols, cross-chain and sidechain bridges” and “zero-knowledge proofs” among other features. Essentially, this year’s upgrade seeks to continue streamlining and building out capabilities that were added with the Cashtokens upgrade in 2023, which enabled UTXO (unspent transaction output)-based smart contracts and token creation on the Bitcoin Cash network for negligible fees. The BCH Bliss 2025 conference will be held from May 13-15 in Ljubljana, Slovenia. Source: Bliss.cash. Tickets for the conference this year take the form of non-fungible “Velma” tokens sold largely on the BCH tokens marketplace Tapswap . A tentative list of speakers has been announced already, featuring miners, app developers, and other prominent figures in the BCH ecosystem focusing on increasing global adoption of the peer-to-peer cash. Political sensationalism not deterring development, privacy While it’s near impossible to read the news these days and not be flooded with partisan politics and polemics, important wallet integrations, stablecoin protocols, and smart contract features continue to develop under the mass media radar on many crypto networks, including Bitcoin Cash. For example, the popular, Philippines-based Paytaca Wallet has just announced a feature (still in early alpha mode) which allows users to stabilize their BCH in dollar value at anytime, in-app, via an integration with BCHBull, a smart-contract based hedging and speculation platform created by Bitcoin Cash developer group General Protocols. This addition complements recent updates to BCHBull itself, and a BCH-based stablecoin experiment called Moria Money . When asked by Cryptopolitan for their thoughts on the upgrade and Bliss conference, Bitcoin Cash Tokyo Meetup organizer and Bliss 2024 attendee BigV noted: “Bliss 2024 had an impressive global reach with attendees flying into Slovenia from all over the world, with a significant number of BCH community activists, developers, enthusiasts and business owners from Japan, which has always been a hot spot for Bitcoin Cash … Bliss 2025 and the May upgrade removes several ‘blockers’ that have to date prevented many of Satoshi’s [bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto’s] unfinished Bitcoin Script ideas, delivering a highly efficient, elegant and practical platform upon which to develop the next generation of decentralised finance applications.” The Tokyo meetup organizer also mentioned “significant efficiency and deployment advantages” over competing EVM (electronic virtual machine)-based chains “which do not scale effectively and existing privacy coins which are less attractive due to the existence of pre-mined tokens hoarded by the ‘foundation,’ tail-emmission inflation and privacy algorithms that are entrenched at the base layer.” Further, with the CashFusion privacy protocol, BigV notes BCH “is thus uniquely positioned to not just be money for the world, but to enable access to powerful permissionless decentralised financial tools to every human on earth.” Cryptopolitan Academy: How to Write a Web3 Resume That Lands Interviews - FREE Cheat Sheet",Bitcoin Cash News & Market Updates|News|BCH|General Protocols|Paytaca|Philippines|Slovenia,EN,0,0,BCH|ASIA|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-12 01:48:58

Unlike typical blockchain projects that focus on finance, gaming, or memes, Web3Bay disrupts the multi-trillion-dollar online retail sector by ensuring transparency, and security, and eliminating fees. It offers staking rewards, community-driven governance, and an appealing high-growth presale, quickly establishing itself as a prominent project priced under $1. Web3Bay (3BAY): Leading Decentralized E-Commerce Domain In today’s market dominated by giants like Amazon, eBay, and Shopify, traditional e-commerce platforms set prices, charge fees, and collect user data. Web3Bay is revolutionizing this landscape by introducing full transparency, reduced costs, and user ownership through blockchain technology. What makes Web3Bay the best crypto to buy today in 2025? 1. Full Decentralization & Smart Contract Renouncement Web3Bay fully decentralizes its operations unlike typical platforms. Following its presale, the development team will relinquish control of its smart contract, preventing any central authority from influencing the platform. Governance shifts to 3BAY token holders who will make crucial decisions regarding transaction fees, feature additions, and partnership strategies. 2. Passive Income with Staking Rewards Web3Bay extends beyond shopping; it also serves as a passive income source. By staking 3BAY tokens, holders can earn rewards, appealing to long-term investors. This staking model allows participants to increase their holdings through price growth and staking returns. 3. 5% Discount for Payments in 3BAY Crypto struggles to gain traction without practical utility. Web3Bay addresses this by offering a 5% discount on transactions using 3BAY tokens, promoting adoption and ensuring the token’s practical value from the outset. 4. Rapid Presale Growth & Huge ROI Potential Web3Bay’s presale is advancing rapidly, already generating over $1 million and distributing more than 285 million tokens. With a current presale price of $0.00456 at Stage 4 and an expected launch price of $0.1959, early investors might see a return on investment up to 4,200%. Analysts anticipate even higher gains following the launch as adoption expands. Web3Bay’s decentralized structure, robust tokenomics, and real-world utility position it as one of the most promising crypto projects for 2025. Bitcoin (BTC): Staying Strong as Crypto’s Cornerstone Bitcoin remains the foundational asset of the cryptocurrency market. The halving event in April 2024 reduced block rewards, enhancing BTC’s scarcity and pushing its price higher. Additionally, institutional adoption has soared with the approval of spot ETFs and broader governmental recognition of Bitcoin as a valuable store of assets. As Bitcoin moves towards wider acceptance and copes with a finite supply, it continues to be one of the best cryptos to buy today. Solana (SOL): Pioneering Speed in Blockchain Technology Solana stands out in the DeFi, NFT, and Web3 gaming landscapes due to its exceptional transaction speed and efficiency, handling over 2,400 transactions per second at minimal costs. It’s one of the top scalable Layer 1 blockchain available. Recent enhancements have resolved earlier network issues, boosting reliability and attracting a larger developer base and institutional interest. With ongoing ETF applications and AI enhancements, Solana is well-positioned as a leading investment for 2025. Cardano (ADA): Most Secure & Decentralization Blockchain Cardano distinguishes itself as one of the most secure and decentralized blockchains, furthered by its Plomin Hard Fork that has integrated on-chain governance, empowering ADA holders with decision-making authority. The platform is broadening its scope in DeFi, corporate partnerships, and staking solutions, with an increasing number of projects building on its network. Cardano’s research-driven methodology underpins its robust security and operational efficiency. With its expanding institutional relationships and upcoming innovations like the Hydra Layer 2 solution, Cardano is set for wider adoption and potential price growth, marking it as a wise choice for 2025. XRP (XRP): Transforming International Payments XRP remains at the forefront of global payment solutions, bolstered by recent regulatory approvals for its RLUSD stablecoin. It continues to facilitate quick, cost-effective international transactions, reinforcing its role in blending crypto with conventional finance. Despite previous legal challenges, Ripple’s advancements in regulatory clarity have solidified its standing in the financial community. Ongoing partnerships with banks underscore a growing trust in XRP’s utility. With its capabilities for instant settlements and low transaction costs, XRP is crucial for modern financial systems. Overview: Best Cryptos to Buy in 2025 The dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market ensures that 2025 will be a pivotal year. Established players like Bitcoin, Solana, Cardano, and XRP are poised to remain influential, while newcomers like Web3Bay demonstrate that innovative projects with practical applications can make significant inroads. With its successful presale, solid use cases, and potential for substantial returns, Web3Bay may emerge as an unexpected leader in the 2025 crypto landscape. For investors seeking stability or growth, these cryptocurrencies are essential considerations for your portfolio.

The blockchain will host the Legacy Mesh solution to connect USDT deployments on Arbitrum, Ethereum, Tron and Ton to a unified USDT0 network. Thanks to Legacy Mesh, users will be able to move USDT between chains for lower costs and with greater access to liquidity pools. USDT0 is intended to free up siloed liquidity by eliminating the burdensome process of bridging. USDT0 is backed 1:1 with USDT. Legacy Mesh will leverage LayerZero’s interoperability protocol. USDT0 will increase access to liquidity pools Steven Goldfeder, co-founder and CEO of Arbitrum developer Offchain Labs, said, “The Legacy Mesh is an important milestone for Arbitrum, ensuring that users and developers have access to deep, liquid markets regardless of the blockchain they are on.” Users will be able to interact with USDT- and USDT0-supported chains. Many emerging blockchain ecosystems, such as Ink, Berachain and MegaETH, support USDT0, according to an Arbitrum press release . The new solution will also permit frictionless transfers of USDT to Telegram wallets, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said on X. By linking the four major blockchains, the introduction of USDT0 connects $138 billion of Tether into a single system. According to the USDT0 blog on Mirror, that represents 98% of all Tether. Tether is thriving despite MiCA Tether began its transition from bridged USDT to USDT0 in January with an automatic swap on the Arbitrum chain, which is a layer-2 Ethereum scaling solution that uses optimistic rollups for consensus. Tether recorded a profit of $13 billion in 2024, despite the boost its competitors received when USDT was excluded from the European Union in July by Markets in Crypto-Assets regulations. It remains by far the largest stablecoin by market cap. Tether’s fortunes look bright in the United States, where newly reelected President Donald Trump is seen as a supporter of dollar-pegged stablecoin in general and Howard Lutnick, CEO of investment firm Cantor Fitzgerald has been nominated to be the next secretary of commerce. Cantor Fitzgerald is the portfolio manager of Tether’s U.S. Treasury securities.

When it launched in August 2020, its price was barely a fraction of a cent, allowing those who believed in its potential to turn small investments into life-changing fortunes. Today, many regret missing out on SHIB’s rise, but a new opportunity is making waves—Arctic Pablo Coin (APC). With an adventurous narrative and a skyrocketing presale, it’s being hailed as one of the best crypto presales to buy right now. This article will explore Shiba Inu’s incredible early success and why Arctic Pablo Coin could be the next big thing for those looking for a high-potential meme coin presale. Shiba Inu’s Early Investors Struck Gold Shiba Inu started as a joke but quickly became a serious player in the crypto world. When SHIB first began trading, its price was so low that a few dollars could buy millions of tokens. By October 2021, SHIB’s value had soared, reaching an all-time high of $0.00008845. Investors who held their tokens from the beginning saw returns of over 1,000,000%, turning small stakes into fortunes. But not everyone was lucky enough to get in early. Many investors watched from the sidelines, unsure whether to take the risk. By the time they realized SHIB’s potential, the price had already skyrocketed, leaving them wishing they had acted sooner. Now, Arctic Pablo Coin is presenting a similar opportunity. Arctic Pablo Coin (APC): A New Era of Meme Coins Begins Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a storytelling-driven crypto project with a unique approach to presale structure. Inspired by an adventurous explorer, APC ties each phase of its presale to a different mythical or legendary location, adding excitement and exclusivity to every stage. Staking Rewards: Earn While You Hold Unlike early meme coins that lacked utility, Arctic Pablo Coin offers a staking mechanism with a 66% APY during its presale. This means investors can earn high rewards simply by holding APC tokens, making it one of the best crypto presales to buy for passive income seekers. Referral Bonuses: Turn Your Network into Earnings APC isn’t just about holding—it’s about growing. The project features an attractive referral incentive, allowing users to earn additional tokens by spreading the word. Those who take advantage of this feature can significantly boost their holdings, just like early SHIB investors who shared the opportunity. Community-Driven Competitions: More Than Just a Token Arctic Pablo Coin thrives on engagement. The team has introduced exciting community competitions where participants can win APC tokens or USD rewards. This approach strengthens its community while giving early investors more reasons to stay engaged. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Presale: A Once-in-a-Lifetime Opportunity? The presale is already in Stage 10, Aqua Frost, with a current price of $0.000059. With over $1.1 million raised, the momentum is building fast. If history teaches anything, it’s that early-stage meme coins with strong narratives can explode in value. Arctic Pablo Coin’s journey has already seen significant growth, and its projected ROI from Stage 10 to the listing price of $0.008 stands at 13,451.72%. For those who regret missing Shiba Inu’s launch, Arctic Pablo Coin is offering a second chance at a high-potential meme coin presale . Final Thoughts: Will You Watch or Act This Time? Shiba Inu created countless millionaires, but not everyone had the foresight to invest early. Now, Arctic Pablo Coin is emerging as a fresh opportunity with a unique narrative, staking rewards, and a rapidly advancing presale. With prices set to rise as it enters new locations, the window to buy at a low entry point is closing. Don’t let history repeat itself—secure your APC tokens before it’s too late! For More Information: Arctic Pablo Coin: https://www.arcticpablo.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/ArcticPabloOfficial Twitter: https://x.com/arcticpabloHQ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What was Shiba Inu’s price when it first launched? Shiba Inu started trading at a fraction of a cent, allowing early investors to accumulate large amounts for very little. What makes Arctic Pablo Coin different from other meme coins? Arctic Pablo Coin integrates an adventurous narrative, staking rewards, referral incentives, and community-driven competitions, setting it apart from traditional meme coins. What is the current stage and price of Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale? Arctic Pablo Coin is currently in Stage 10 (Aqua Frost), with a price of $0.000059 per token. How does Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale structure work? Unlike standard staged presales, APC’s phases are tied to unique locations, making each phase part of an unfolding adventure. Why is Arctic Pablo Coin considered one of the best crypto presales to buy? With a strong narrative, high staking APY, referral rewards, and a rapidly progressing presale, APC offers a rare opportunity to get in early on a high-potential meme coin.

BTC is struggling and might extend losses if it stays below the $100,000 level. Bitcoin started a fresh decline from the $98,500 resistance zone. The price is trading below $96,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $96,670 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears the $97,600 zone. Bitcoin Price Dips Again Bitcoin price failed to continue higher above the $100,000 zone. It started another decline below the $96,500 zone. BTC gained bearish momentum for a move below the $96,000 and $95,500 levels. There was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $96,670 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The price tested the $95,000 zone and recently recovered some losses. There was a move above the $95,750 level. The price surpassed the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $98,442 swing high to the $94,899 low. Bitcoin price is now trading below $96,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $96,650 level. The first key resistance is near the $97,000 level. The next key resistance could be $97,600 or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $98,442 swing high to the $94,899 low. A close above the $97,600 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $98,500 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $100,000 level. Another Decline In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $97,000 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $95,500 level. The first major support is near the $95,000 level. The next support is now near the $93,500 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $92,000 support in the near term. The main support sits at $91,000. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $95,500, followed by $95,000.

For those planning ahead, finding the best long-term cryptos could lead to huge returns. But with so many choices, how do you find real value instead of just hype? With 2025 expected to be a major year for crypto, we’ve picked three growing altcoins with strong foundations and big growth potential. One of them, Web3Bay (3BAY), is making waves in decentralized e-commerce. Most cryptos focus on DeFi, AI, or memes, but Web3Bay is addressing a trillion-dollar market—online shopping. By cutting out middlemen, removing hidden fees, and providing passive earnings, voting rights, and real-world use, Web3Bay is one of the best long-term cryptos under $1 today. Let’s look at three cryptos set for major growth in 2025 and why Web3Bay is leading the way. Web3Bay (3BAY): The Future of Online Shopping on Blockchain Big companies like Amazon, eBay, and Shopify dominate e-commerce, taking high fees, controlling user data, and limiting seller options. Web3Bay is changing this by bringing fairness, transparency, and full ownership to online shopping. 1. Full Decentralization & Smart Contract Lock Unlike many projects that claim decentralization but still hold control, Web3Bay is truly community-driven. After presale, the team will lock its smart contract, making sure no one—not even Web3Bay—can alter the platform. 2. Earn Passive Income Through Staking Web3Bay is not just for shopping; it’s also a way to grow assets. Those who hold 3BAY can stake their holdings and receive rewards, making it an ideal choice for those who prefer long-term earning. By staking 3BAY, users help keep the network stable while getting more coins in return—a win-win for both the system and its community. 3. 5% Discount on Purchases with 3BAY Unlike many cryptos that have no real-world use, Web3Bay allows buyers to get a 5% discount when using 3BAY for payments. This increases adoption while ensuring the coin has value from day one. 4. No Extra Charges, No Middlemen Traditional online stores take a big cut from sellers’ earnings. Web3Bay removes these unnecessary costs, offering a fee-free space where buyers and sellers connect directly. This setup makes Web3Bay a great option for businesses wanting higher profits and smoother transactions. 5. Growing Presale & High Return Potential Web3Bay’s presale is rapidly gaining attention, with over $1 million raised and 280 million coins sold. Currently valued at $0.00456 in Stage 4, its expected launch price of $0.1959 could bring a 4,200% return for early buyers. As crypto adoption continues, Web3Bay’s real-world utility and voting system makes it one of the best long-term cryptos, offering lasting benefits beyond short-term market trends. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU): From NFT Collection to Meme Coin Power Pudgy Penguins began as one of the top NFT collections in 2021 and has now entered the meme coin market. The PENGU coin allows access to exclusive content, NFT releases, and gaming experiences, combining meme culture with Web3. While meme coins often depend on social hype rather than solid use cases, Pudgy Penguins has a strong brand, an engaged community, and recognizable designs—factors that could push PENGU forward in 2025. However, meme coins tend to be unstable. Those interested in them should be aware of possible sudden price changes. Worldcoin (WLD): A Chance to Buy at a Low Price? Worldcoin gained attention in 2023 as an AI-based crypto linked to OpenAI. It seeks to verify digital identities through biometric scans, aiming to create a global financial network on blockchain. After an initial price spike, Worldcoin’s popularity dropped, and WLD is now 81.5% below its highest point. But with AI-driven cryptos becoming more common, some see WLD as a possible comeback pick—especially as AI and blockchain continue merging. That said, concerns about privacy and regulations remain major hurdles that could affect Worldcoin’s success over time. Best Long-Term Cryptos for 2025– Final Verdict! Each of these projects has strong potential, but Web3Bay stands out with its clear real-world purpose. While PENGU and Worldcoin rely on market trends, Web3Bay’s decentralized shopping system, passive earnings, and fee-free model offer long-term value. With a locked smart contract, staking rewards, voting rights, and a fair marketplace, Web3Bay is among the best long-term cryptos available today. Plus, its presale momentum and strong growth projections make it a solid choice for those looking beyond short-lived market hype. As e-commerce moves toward decentralization, Web3Bay is shaping the future of online shopping. Its approach ensures fair access for all, making it one of the best long-term cryptos to watch in 2025 and beyond.

SEC Crypto Task Force Head Hester Peirce Weighs In appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In a major development, cryptocurrency exchange Binance and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have filed a joint motion to pause their ongoing legal battle for 60 days. In the light of this news, Hester Peirce, SEC Commissioner and Head of the SEC Crypto Task Force, was asked “What other cases do you have to untangle?” Speaking to Bloomberg, Peirce said that people are aware the SEC has filed many cases in recent years against various individuals and entities in the crypto space. Each case needs to be considered individually, and there are many cases to handle. She added that this part of the work will take time and patience. Peirce was also questioned about her stance on crypto and whether she advocates for the industry. She clarified that she does not describe herself as a proponent of the industry, but as a “freedom maximalist.” She believes in the importance of using regulation to support innovation rather than stifle it. Peirce criticized the SEC’s approach, saying that it has put up roadblocks for people trying to engage with regulators or register as required.

She opened up about the ability of blockchain technology to enable people to collaborate globally and securely, opening new possibilities in both financial and non-financial sectors. Peirce expressed excitement about the future of crypto and its potential integration into traditional financial systems, while also exploring other uses outside of finance.

ETH might gain bullish momentum if it clears the $2,700 resistance zone. Ethereum started a fresh decline below the $2,650 level. The price is trading below $2,680 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,690 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a decent upward move if it settles above $2,700 and $2,735. Ethereum Price Eyes Upside Break Ethereum price started a fresh decline below the $2,800 support zone, like Bitcoin . ETH declined below the $2,750 and $2,700 support levels to move into a short-term bearish zone. The price dipped and tested the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $2,125 swing low to the $2,922 high. Finally, it found support near the $2,500 zone. The price is now consolidating and seems to be forming a base above the $2,500 level. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,680 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,690 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,680 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,735 level. The main resistance is now forming near $2,800 or $2,820. A clear move above the $2,820 resistance might send the price toward the $2,920 resistance. An upside break above the $2,920 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,000 resistance zone or even $3,050 in the near term. Another Drop In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,700 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,550 level. The first major support sits near the $2,520 zone. A clear move below the $2,520 support might push the price toward the $2,440 support or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $2,125 swing low to the $2,922 high. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,365 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,250.

It’s no secret that traders love volatility, and right now, Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) is seeing a trading volume surge of 15.44%, while Floki Inu’s market cap just shot up by 7.18%. But there’s an even bigger shake-up happening—BTFD Coin (BTFD) has entered Stage 14 of its presale, burning all unsold tokens from Stage 13 and launching an exclusive referral program that’s turning heads. Meme coins have evolved beyond their viral status. They’re now serious investment opportunities backed by powerful communities and innovative financial models. These best new meme coins for significant returns don’t just offer hype; they deliver results. BTFD Coin, Peanut the Squirrel, and Floki Inu are proving why meme coins remain some of the most exciting assets in crypto today. BTFD Coin’s Referral Program Ignites Massive Investor Interest Imagine earning rewards just for spreading the word about a booming meme coin. That’s exactly what’s happening with BTFD Coin’s Referral Program , an initiative designed to reward early supporters while increasing community participation. It’s a game-changer—traders can earn 10% of the amount their referrals invest in BTFD tokens if they make it into the top 20 referrers of the month. The BTFD Coin presale has already raised over $6 million, with 69 billion tokens sold and a growing holder count of over 10,500 Bulls. At $0.00016 per token, Stage 14 is offering investors a massive opportunity. When the token lists at $0.0006, investors who get in now could see serious returns. Analysts predict that if BTFD Coin reaches $0.006, the upside potential is staggering. A $4,000 investment at today’s price gets 25 million BTFD tokens, which would be worth $15,000 at listing and $150,000 at peak projection. BTFD Coin isn’t just about numbers; it’s a movement fueled by its Bulls Squad, a community that believes in holding strong. With its play-to-earn game already launched, a staking system offering 90% APY, and aggressive tokenomics, BTFD Coin is locking in investor confidence. Buying BTFD is straightforward. Investors connect their wallets on the BTFD buy page , load BNB or ETH, enter the LAUNCH100 bonus code, and purchase their tokens. With the bonus in play, every purchase is doubled.

Quintenz previously served in the regulator between 2017 and 2021, where he organized the Technology Advisory Committee. During his time as commissioner, he said a self-regulatory organization specific to the crypto industry could help oversee companies . Since leaving the agency, he joined a16z, where he became the head of policy . A16z was one of the major funders of Fairshake, a crypto-focused political action committee which poured close to $140 million into the 2024 election. Punchbowl News first reported the nomination. In a statement, Acting CFTC Chair Caroline Pham said, ""I congratulate my friend Brian Quintenz on his selection for CFTC Chairman. I worked with Brian on important initiatives that he led to success when he was a CFTC Commissioner. He will do the same for crypto and innovation. I look forward to supporting Brian and his leadership at the CFTC."" Industry groups likewise supported the nomination after news of it spread. Miller Whitehouse-Levine, the CEO of the DeFi Education Fund, a lobbying group, said the organization looked forward to working with him. ""Brian has a long track record of supporting DeFi and advocating for sound policies that will enable DeFi developers and users to thrive in the United States,"" he said in a statement. In recent years, the industry and Congress have pushed toward giving the CFTC greater oversight of the industry. Former CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam advocated for making the agency a primary market regulator for at least parts of the industry, including overseeing spot Bitcoin markets. A bill, the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, would have given the CFTC greater authority over crypto policy.

Chainlink’s Data Streams Go Live While Web3Bay Teases 4200% ROI,https://thecoinrise.com/big-news-for-web3-users-chainlinks-data-streams-go-live-while-web3bay-teases-4200-roi/,"Blockchain is moving past speculation as Chainlink’s ecosystem, LQUID PAY’s payment card, and Web3Bay’s Web3 marketplace drive real-world use and financial control. The Chainlink ecosystem has grown with the launch of Data Streams on Scroll, providing low-latency market data and improving the speed of DeFi apps. At the same time, Web3 users now have better control over their funds with LQUID PAY’s self-custody payment card, which enables crypto spending while merchants receive fiat instantly. However, the most promising financial shift is happening in Web3 commerce, led by Web3Bay (3BAY) . At $0.004562625 per 3BAY in presale stage 4, buyers are looking at a projected 4,200% return at launch. More than price increases, Web3Bay is designed for long-term benefits—holders earn passive income, and those who pay with 3BAY enjoy 5% discounts on purchases. Chainlink Ecosystem Boosts DeFi With Data Streams The Chainlink ecosystem has taken another leap forward by launching Chainlink Data Streams on the Scroll mainnet. Scroll, an Ethereum-based zero-knowledge rollup, now allows developers to access the Chainlink ecosystem’s fast market data, improving the speed and efficiency of DeFi apps. Since its mainnet debut in October 2023, Scroll has expanded rapidly, teaming up with Ether.fi, Alchemy Pay, and Nansen to strengthen its network. With Chainlink’s oracle now integrated, DeFi projects on Scroll can offer an experience as seamless as traditional banking, taking blockchain-powered finance to new heights. Web3 Users Gain More Financial Control With LQUID PAY’s Card Traditional banks have struggled to meet the needs of Web3 users, but LQUID PAY is bridging the gap with its new self-custody payment card. Unlike regular cards that depend on banks, this Visa-backed card lets users spend digital assets directly from their wallets while merchants receive fiat instantly. By cutting out high fees, long wait times, and crypto compatibility issues, LQUID PAY creates a smooth link between blockchain and real-world payments. This is especially useful in regions where crypto is widely used, but banking infrastructure is lacking. Web3Bay Offers Huge ROI for Early Birds– Get in Now! Web3Bay is making waves in the crypto market by changing how people buy digital assets. In just a few weeks, its presale raised over $1.1 million, selling more than 280 million tokens. With three presale stages already gone, stage 4 is almost sold out at $0.004562625 per 3BAY token. Yet, those who join now can still target a 4,200% return at launch, with even higher post-launch predictions. Beyond just price growth, Web3Bay also provides long-term earning potential. Web3Bay’s 3BAY token does more than help users buy digital assets—it gives transaction discounts, staking rewards, and governance rights. Paying with 3BAY grants a 5% discount, making it better than traditional fiat payments. But the real benefit comes from staking, where users can lock up their tokens and earn passive income while supporting the Web3Bay platform. In addition, Web3Bay is fully community-driven. Unlike centralized platforms that control how users buy digital assets, Web3Bay gives decision-making power to its users. Holders can vote on key platform changes, from transaction fees to new features and partnerships. The more involved a user is, the more they can earn—something traditional marketplaces can’t match. Wrapping Up! The Chainlink ecosystem’s latest integration with Scroll proves that DeFi apps can match traditional finance in speed and efficiency, bringing blockchain adoption closer to reality. Meanwhile, LQUID PAY is breaking down barriers between crypto and daily spending, allowing users to make payments without relying on banks. But the project truly changing Web3 finance is Web3Bay, a decentralized marketplace reshaping how users buy digital assets while increasing their earnings. With a potential 4,200% return at launch , staking rewards, transaction discounts, and governance rights, Web3Bay offers more than just short-term price gains—it’s a long-term earning opportunity. However, timing is crucial—those who act early on Web3Bay secure the best prices, the highest returns, and the biggest rewards before the next price jump.

They argue that the SEC is wrongly claiming authority over most digital asset transactions in Texas and the U.S. The case was filed as Lejilex prepared to launch a new trading platform, seeking confirmation that transactions on the platform don’t need SEC registration. They hope to stop SEC rules they believe are hurting legitimate U.S. businesses. “The SEC’s rogue enforcement actions targeting our industry have paralyzed those of us who just want to build lawful businesses and technologies. Fear of rogue enforcement should not be a thing entrepreneurs are forced to experience,” the firm had said previously. They added, “We hope our action encourages the SEC to reconsider its regulatory approach, and we welcome them to work with us and our industry to ensure the most important technologies of the future are built here in America, under American laws, consistent with American values.”",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|BNB|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-12 04:05:42

The price is now moving lower and might decline below the $2.30 level. XRP price started a fresh decline from the $2.50 zone. The price is now trading below $2.420 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2.3650 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start a fresh increase if it clears the $2.50 resistance zone. XRP Price Dips Again XRP price struggled to settle above the $2.50 resistance zone. The price started another decline from the $2.52 level, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a move below the $2.45 level. The price dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.31 swing low to the $2.52 high. The price even spiked below the $2.40 level.

On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.440 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.50 level. The next resistance is $2.520. A clear move above the $2.520 resistance might send the price toward the $2.60 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.650 resistance or even $2.720 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.80. More Losses? If XRP fails to clear the $2.50 resistance zone, it could start another decline.

The announcement has stirred excitement in the network with Pi coin surging to $92. Finally, Pi Mainnet To Launch On 20 Feb Pi Network, which began in 2019, has built a strong community of users known as Pioneers who have been mining Pi tokens on their mobile devices.

The Core Team will prioritize reliable contributors when transitioning nodes from Testnet to Mainnet.

It’s the first Layer-2 solution on Solana, and its ongoing presale just crossed $19 million. Meme coins have recently experienced a rollercoaster ride as their market cap fell below $70 billion. As market sentiment enters the fear zone, only a handful of projects continue to defy uncertainty. Solaxy is doing just that because of its plan to tackle Solana’s congestion issues. Under the new SEC administration, the future of crypto could be quite promising. The SEC recently recognized a Solana-based ETF application, kicking off the approval process with a final decision due by October 2025. Solaxy could benefit from this as a layer-2 solution for Solana. You can currently buy SOLX for $0.00163 , but that price will increase once the presale moves to the next stage. Solaxy Targets Solana’s Scalability Concerns Solana has earned praise for its high-speed and low-cost transactions, which have attracted new token launches over the past few years. Despite its popularity, Solana has often experienced network slowdowns and transaction failures during the $TRUMP and $MELANIA coin launches. These issues are a major headache for DeFi users, NFT enthusiasts, and meme coin traders. Solaxy aims to solve these pain points by processing some transactions off the main chain. It then batch-submits transaction data back to Solana’s Layer-1, preventing traffic jams at peak times. This approach lowers fees and increases throughput, allowing even the biggest token launches to happen without bogging down Solana’s core network. Moreover, Solaxy Bridges Solana with Ethereum. This cross-chain design channels liquidity from Ethereum into the Solana network, potentially driving deeper liquidity. With SOLX as the main currency of this Layer-2 ecosystem, popular analysts like ClayBro are predicting a 10x gain after its exchange listing. That might even be a conservative estimate. Top Layer-2 tokens like Arbitrum have already reached a market cap of $1 billion, proving how quickly these projects can scale with mainstream adoption. How Solana’s Growth Could Help SOLX Grow Although the meme coin market has struggled this year, analysts expect a strong rebound in 2025 due to solid fundamentals. Over 14% of all Bitcoin is now held in treasuries , and Bitcoin spot ETFs saw a net inflow of $204 million in just the past week. Some experts even predict Solana could see a 10x price rally this year if the broader market rebounds. Despite global crypto market fluctuations, Solana remains a top chain with the second-highest total value locked (TVL) in DeFi, currently around $9.3 billion—second only to Ethereum. DefiLama – Solana TVL Historically, Layer-2 tokens have moved in close correlation with the performance of the Layer-1 chains they support. For instance, Polygon (MATIC) and Arbitrum often mirror Ethereum’s movements. If Solana experiences another surge, SOLX would likely ride that wave and offer exponential returns to its early supporters. With Solaxy’s presale now crossing $19 million, the next threshold of $20 million is already in sight. This momentum shows how buyers see long-term potential in Solaxy’s layer-2 solution. How to buy SOLX Visit Solaxy’s official presale website to buy SOLX at its current price of $0.00163. Buyers have a limited window to buy the tokens before their price increases in the next round. Investors can connect their crypto wallet (Like Best Wallet) to the buying widget. Best Wallet lets you easily track your SOLX investments before the presale ends. You can also get a high staking APY of up to 200% on SOLX during the presale stage.

Bitcoin (BTC) price again swooped to a $95K low, whereas altcoins such as Ethereum (ETH), XRP, and Solana (SOL) mimicked a dipping trajectory. Meanwhile, market participants remain cautious as the U.S. CPI and PPI data are set to be released shortly ahead. Crypto Prices On Feb 12: Here’s All To Know Against the backdrop of broader trends, the global cryptocurrency market cap slipped by 1.82% in the past 24 hours, reaching $3.14 trillion. However, the total market volume increased by 8% intraday, reaching $105.57 billion. As mentioned above, the crypto market slumped as Jerome Powell’s testimony before the Senate Banking Committee reflected a hawkish stance on policies. In turn, risk assets such as crypto are under the heat, facing immense selling pressure. Notably, nearly $240 million was recorded to have been liquidated across the market in the past 24 hours as an aftermath. BTC Price Wanes To $95K Amid Broader Crypto Market Flux As of press time, BTC price tanked over 2% to reach $95,389. The flagship crypto’s 24-hour low and high were $94,875.04 and $98,492.90, respectively. Bitcoin’s dominance dropped 0.08% from yesterday, resting at 60.37%. Further, the coin saw nearly $44 million worth of liquidations in the past 24 hours, per Coinglass data . ETH Price Dips In Sync ETH price fell by 3.5% intraday and is now sitting at $2,592. The coin’s 24-hour low and high were $2,565.40 and $2,724.90, respectively. Ethereum’s waning action falls in line with the broader trend, further accompanied by $30.23 million worth of liquidations in the past 24 hours. XRP Price Slips 2% Simultaneously, XRP price’s intraday chart showcased a 2% decline in value, with the asset now resting at $2.39. Its intraday bottom and peak were $2.38 and $2.53, respectively. The Ripple-backed asset recorded liquidations worth $6.05 million in the past 24 hours. SOL Price Loses 3% Also, SOL price cracked slightly over 3% in the past 24 hours and is now trading at $194.61. The coin’s intraday low and high were $194.23 and $205.92, respectively. Meme Crypto Prices In The Red Additionally, Dogecoin (DOGE) price saw a 2.5% decline intraday, now at $0.2512. Further, Shiba Inu (SHIB) price also fell 2% to reach $0.00001561 despite rising SHIB whale activity . Even PEPE, TRUMP, and BONK lost alarming values over the past day, dropping 2%-6%. Looming US CPI & PPI Data Sparks Uncertainty Further, key macroeconomic data such as the U.S. CPI & PPI are set to be released shortly ahead. With Powell already hinting at a hawkish stance on monetary policies, market watchers expect the CPI & PPI to contribute to the pressure on risk assets due to inflationary pressures. The data, set to be released on February 12 and 13, has further kept investors cautious. Nevertheless, some tokens have defied the current volatile trend, trading dominantly in the green. Top Crypto Gainer Prices Today Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) Price: $1.33 24-Hour Gains: +5% Sonic (S) Price: $0.4666 24-Hour Gains: +5% FTX Token (FTT) Price: $2.02 24-Hour Gains: +5% Top Crypto Loser Prices Today Onyxcoin (XCN) Price: $0.02112 24-Hour Loss: -9% Ethena (ENA) Price: $0.4337 24-Hour Loss: -9% JasmyCoin (JASMY) Price: $0.02185 24-Hour Loss: -6% Overall, the current market scenario remains volatile, primarily attributable to macroeconomic developments.

He is the CEO of Galaxy Investment Partners and cryptocurrency investment firm. Initially booked to begin his Galaxy Digital resources Fund on December 15, 2017, he retired plans since he didn't like market conditions. He stated that 20% of his net worth was in bitcoin and Ethereum. He made $250 million from cryptocurrency from 2016-to 2017. Galaxy digital holding Ltd. is among one of the few cryptocurrency companies needed to publish financial results. In the initial nine months of 2018, the organization lost $136 million in digital currency exchange. In 2017, it contributed $80 million in funding to the technology company Bitfury. In September 2017, he was listed at # 317 on the Forbes 400 with a net worth of $1.5 billion. He was ranked 962 on the march 2008 Forbes list of world billionaires with a net worth of $102 billion. The same year he became a member of Kappa Beta Phi, a wall street secret society made up of wealthy financial executives. He will probably stay occupied with bringing awareness about crypto and blockchain as well as working with worldwide controllers to drive crypto reception among the majority. He said that his New Year's goal for 2022 is to ""clear up for the ever-evolving administration in Congress that crypto is moderate."" Investor Chief Executive Officer Board Member discussed the positive shift in the crypto space, explaining how the industry has changed in recent years. He said that after four years of feeling “abused” and misunderstood, the mood in crypto has changed dramatically. He explained that with a new SEC leadership and a resurgence of Bitcoin, the industry is beginning to feel like it could play a key role in both finance and consumer spaces. Novogratz also predicted that in May or June, the industry could see several companies listing on major exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ. Big Move Incoming for Bitcoin? As for Bitcoin, Novogratz believes it has established itself as a store of value and will continue to grow globally. He predicts that Bitcoin might even end up on government balance sheets within the next six months, though the process of integrating it may take time. “Bitcoin has a store of value, it’s carved out a lane, it is becoming global. It might or might not be on the government’s balance sheet in six months. I actually think it will. I think there are people trying to figure out how to do it gracefully, and so I don’t think Bitcoin’s going away,” He Said. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Funding Rate Hits Zero: Crypto Bull Run Ahead? , He then opened up about the increasing importance of stablecoins, which are becoming significant players in the financial system, with stablecoin legislation moving forward.

For Alibaba, securing a deal with Apple is no less than a breakthrough. Alibaba’s latest AI model Qwen 2.5-Max has reportedly outperformed Llama-3.1-405B and GPT-4o, and in 2025 alone, its stock has gone up by over 30%, reaching a price of $111.90 at press time. Alibaba Group stock price (Source: Google Finance) The Information mentioned that Apple’s iPhone users typically spend more money, so if Alibaba can cater to them, it could charge higher fees and potentially grow its cloud revenues faster (11% yearly gains in fiscal 2026). For months, Apple’s AI strategy for China remained uncertain. As a result of which, Apple lost market share to rivals like Huawei that offered smartphones with AI tools. Last holiday quarter, iPhone sales dipped in China due to its lack of AI features.

Early hype around TST after its recent Binance listing had sent the token to see massive gains. However, the excitement was short-lived after former Binance CEO Changpang Zhao’s disassociation with the token. This is why many investors are now turning to other utility-focused meme coins with high long-term potential. TST Plunges 60% After Exponential Gains Binance announced the listing of Cheems (1000CHEEMS) and TST on February 9. Both tokens were flagged under Binance’s “seed tag,” warning of higher-than-normal risks. This announcement created enough hype to see exponential growth toward $0.5, reaching a market cap of around $500 million. However, Binance co-founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) quickly clarified that the listing was never an endorsement of TST. TST got listed on Binance. A few thoughts: 1. CZ said “fundamentals”, then talks about a test coin turned meme coin. I posted to clarify that TST was NOT endorsed by me/us. It was just a test token used in a video tutorial. But every clarification post just made it more viral… — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) February 9, 2025 CZ clarified that TST was essentially just a “test token” created to demonstrate the BNB Chain’s meme launchpad, not a serious project endorsed by him or Binance. TST now hovered around $0.16, with a market cap of around $156 million. While a rebound from the immediate support level isn’t entirely off the table, TST’s recovery remains uncertain due to its lack of utility. In the bigger picture, the new administration’s recent announcement of 25% tariffs on aluminum and steel has created more uncertainty around risk assets. Despite these headwinds, the crypto market has shown resilience. Over the past week, Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded a net inflow of nearly $204 million, while Ethereum’s spot ETF reached $420 million. Last week (February 3 to February 7, Eastern Time), Bitcoin spot ETF had a net inflow of US$204 million. Ethereum spot ETF had a net inflow of US$420 million. https://t.co/YanotfbWiJ — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) February 10, 2025 It’s worth noting that the meme coin market dropped 30% over the past week. This creates an opportunity to buy meme coins while the market still picks up. Given TST’s recent decline and uncertainty, “smart money” is looking for meme coins that offer upside potential and practical utility. Investors are turning to these 3 high-potential meme coins. Solaxy First on the list is Solaxy ($SOLX) , which many analysts believe could greatly benefit from an upcoming Solana bull run. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently acknowledged Grayscale’s bid for a Solana ETF. Why does this matter for Solaxy? Because Solaxy is the first-ever Layer-2 solution on the Solana network, meaning it aims to address the scalability challenges that have sometimes slowed Solana’s main chain. Solaxy can help reduce congestion and lower transaction fees by processing transactions off the main layer. The SOLX presale has attracted over $19 million, and the token’s price currently sits at $0.00163. You can also stake your SOLX tokens for a staking APY of up to 200%. Solaxy uses a multi-chain approach that combines the capabilities of Ethereum with Solana, offering more flexibility for its token holders. If the Solana ETF is approved, demand for SOL will likely skyrocket. A surge in network usage could stress Solana’s Layer-1 chain, making a Layer-2 scaling solution like Solaxy even more essential. Visit Solaxy Presale MIND of Pepe Another meme coin on investors’ radar is MIND of Pepe ($MIND) . It’s a self-evolving, autonomous AI agent coin redefining how retail traders get the latest market insights. The goal is to cut through the noise of social media hype and speculation to identify high-potential trades. MIND of Pepe is an AI-powered agent that offers real-time analysis from blockchains and social platforms like X. It interacts with influencers and crypto communities to give exclusive insights to the MIND token holders. You can receive alerts about upcoming presales, hidden gems on a decentralized exchange, or even early-stage NFT projects. As a MIND token holder, you get exclusive access to these insights before everyone else. The MIND token presale has already raised $5.5 million thus far. Buyers can also stake their MIND tokens for a staking APY of up to 400%. The current presale price is $0.0032924 per token, but it will soon increase when the presale enters its next round. Visit MIND of Pepe Shiba Inu Shiba Inu is the second-largest meme coin by market cap and has matured well beyond its funny status. Today, It has a growing ecosystem because of its technology rollouts like Shibarium, which is an Ethereum Layer-2 solution specifically designed for the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Shibarium sets the stage for new dApps and DeFi platforms that rely on the Shiba Inu network by allowing faster transactions and reducing fees. More activity on Shibarium could mean demand for SHIB, potentially driving the token’s price higher. Although SHIB is trading nearly 81% below its ATH of $0.00008616, it still has plenty of room to grow. Shiba Inu’s “SHIB Army” has shown its support through multiple market cycles, an advantage many meme coins lack. If 2025 sees another altcoin boom and Shibarium continues to expand, Shiba Inu could reclaim and surpass its old highs.",Press Release,EN,0,0,SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SOL,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-12 04:51:09

The trust was formed on February 10 by the CSC Delaware Trust Company, which has previously registered crypto trust products for other asset managers, including Bitwise. To proceed with the ETF, Franklin Templeton must file a Form 19b-4 and a Form S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). If approved, the Franklin Solana Trust would aim to track the price movements of Solana (SOL), currently the world’s fifth-largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of approximately $97 billion. The filing did not specify which exchange would list the ETF. However, Franklin Templeton’s existing spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) ETFs are both listed on the Cboe BZX exchange. Franklin Templeton has previously expressed strong support for the Solana network, highlighting its resilience in overcoming “technological growing pains” and its demonstration of the potential of high-throughput, monolithic blockchain architectures. Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas have estimated a 70% chance of an approved spot Solana ETF before the end of 2025. They noted that these odds increased significantly following President Donald Trump’s election victory in November. On February 11, the SEC acknowledged Form 19b-4 filings for spot Solana ETFs submitted by 21Shares, Bitwise, Canary Capital, and VanEck. Earlier, on February 6, the SEC acknowledged Grayscale’s Solana filing, a noteworthy development given the agency’s previous rejections of similar applications under former Chair Gary Gensler. Financial services firm JPMorgan has projected that an approved spot Solana ETF could attract between $3 billion and $6 billion in net assets within its first year. Analyst Eric Balchunas described this forecast as a “reasonable guess.” As of now, Solana is trading at $198.5, reflecting a 1.5% decrease over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,SOL|REGULATION|EXCHANGE|BTC|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-02-12 04:57:18

40224086,https://timestabloid.com/?p=57018,1739336421,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,U.S SEC Acknowledges Solana (SOL) ETFs Filed by Major Asset Managers,https://timestabloid.com/u-s-sec-acknowledges-solana-sol-etfs-filings/,"In a major development for the cryptocurrency market, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has acknowledged filings for spot Solana (SOL) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) submitted by leading asset managers 21Shares, Bitwise, Canary Capital, and VanEck. As reported by Cointelegraph, this acknowledgment marks a crucial step in the regulatory process and could pave the way for broader investor access to Solana through traditional financial products. A Step Toward Institutional Adoption The SEC’s acknowledgment of these ETF filings does not guarantee approval, but it signifies that the regulatory body has formally begun reviewing the applications. This is a critical milestone, as spot ETFs provide investors with exposure to an asset without requiring direct ownership. Given the success of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which saw billions in inflows within weeks of approval, many in the Solana community view this as a sign that institutional adoption could be accelerating. Solana has positioned itself as one of the strongest blockchain networks, known for its high-speed transactions and low fees. By acknowledging these filings, the SEC has indirectly recognized the growing demand for Solana-based investment products. If approved , these ETFs would provide institutional investors with a regulated and more accessible means of gaining exposure to Solana, potentially bringing significant capital inflows into the ecosystem. Community and Market Reactions The Solana community has responded with strong enthusiasm to the news, with many seeing it as a bullish catalyst for SOL’s price and long-term growth. Market analyst Thomas Kralow expressed his optimism, stating that such progress in the ETF space would have been “unimaginable just two years ago.” Another community member, Wampa1, highlighted how quickly the SEC moved on Solana ETFs following Bitcoin, suggesting that major financial players are eager to capitalize on Solana’s advantages, particularly its high-speed blockchain. Rare Rigel also chimed in, noting that ETF approvals signal growing institutional interest in blockchain technology. He pointed out that as more financial instruments integrate with the crypto space, interoperability between different networks—such as Solana and cross-chain solutions like Mynth—will become increasingly relevant. This suggests that Solana’s role in the broader blockchain ecosystem could expand further with institutional backing. Implications for Solana’s Value One of the most significant potential effects of a spot Solana ETF approval is its impact on SOL’s market value. Historically, ETF approvals have been followed by price surges due to increased demand from institutional investors. When Bitcoin’s spot ETFs were approved in early 2024, BTC saw a rapid price increase, driven by billions of dollars in inflows from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity. If Solana follows a similar trajectory, its price could experience substantial growth. Solana is considered one of the top-performing Layer-1 blockchains, often viewed as a serious competitor to Ethereum. This could be further validated by the launch of spot ETFs, bringing more credibility and trust to the network. This would likely encourage retail and institutional investors to accumulate SOL, potentially driving prices higher in the short and long term. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Regulatory and Market Considerations Despite the optimism, there are still hurdles to overcome. The SEC’s regulatory stance on cryptocurrencies remains cautious, and the approval process for spot ETFs is often complex and lengthy. Additionally, Solana’s performance in the coming months depends on broader market conditions. If macroeconomic factors, such as Federal Reserve interest rate decisions, affect investor sentiment, they could impact SOL’s trajectory even if the ETFs are approved. Another key consideration is how Solana differentiates itself from Bitcoin in the eyes of regulators. Bitcoin’s approval was largely based on its recognition as a digital commodity, whereas Solana, like Ethereum, could face additional scrutiny over potential classification as a security. The SEC’s treatment of Ethereum in upcoming regulatory decisions may offer clues about Solana’s ETF prospects. The SEC’s acknowledgment of Solana ETF filings marks a significant step in the mainstream adoption of SOL as an institutional asset. While the approvals are not guaranteed, the progress is a strong signal of Solana’s growing relevance in crypto. If these ETFs receive the green light, Solana could see increased institutional interest, leading to greater liquidity and potential price appreciation. For now, the Solana community remains highly optimistic, with many believing that this development could push SOL further into the spotlight. As regulatory processes unfold, investors will be watching closely to see if Solana can follow in Bitcoin’s footsteps and solidify its position as one of the top assets in the digital economy.

The collaborations will offer mutual benefits, including public blockchain visibility, innovative marketing opportunities, and joint PR and branding efforts. The contributed assets will be held in WLFI’s publicly accessible wallets to provide institutions with transparent exposure to the crypto community. As per WLFI, institutions will directly engage with its ‘vibrant community’ to ‘showcase its commitment’ to innovation through strategic initiatives. Collaborative marketing campaigns will highlight these partnerships and position participating institutions at the top of the expanding financial landscape. World Liberty Financial said its strength was in its dynamic and engaging community, calling on its community for support and active participation as it ‘set sail’ on this journey. The Trump-affiliated crypto project said that a detailed Macro Strategy proposal would soon be available on its governance forum. WLFI encouraged its community to review the proposal, provide feedback, and share their insights to help shape this historic plan.

Quintenz’s appointment at CFTC could be a big win for the crypto industry considering that he has very closely worked with crypto players in the past. Brian Quintenz to Be the Permanent US CFTC Chair? Former U.S. President Donald Trump has reportedly chosen Brian Quintenz, current Head of Policy at Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) Crypto and a former CFTC, to be the permanent chairperson of the agency. Qunitenz was among the candidates interviewed by Donald Trump for the US CFTC chair position. Although the White House has yet to make an official announcement regarding this, Fox Business Journalist Eleanor Terret said that officials within the CFTC have confirmed the appointment. Speaking on the development, Caroline D. Pham, the acting chairman of the US CFTC said: “I congratulate my friend Brian Quintenz on his selection for CFTC Chairman. I worked with Brian on important initiatives that he led to success when he was a CFTC Commissioner. He will do the same for crypto and innovation. I look forward to supporting Brian and his leadership at the CFTC.” What It Means For the Crypto Industry? Brian Quintenz has been leading the crypto policy at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and has a good grasp of the functioning of the crypto industry. This will help in policymaking while properly understanding the crypto industry requirements instead of taking the regulation-by-enforcement approach. If confirmed, Brian Quintenz would serve as a key link between digital assets and traditional finance. During his tenure at the CFTC, Quintenz advocated for digital asset derivatives and event contracts—policies he has actively promoted at Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). His extensive experience makes him well-suited to navigate the agency through evolving crypto regulations and market dynamics. The Crypto Pilot Program By the Regulator Last week, the US CFTC announced that it plans to hold a CEO forum in order to discuss the launch of its crypto pilot program . Crypto firms such as Circle, Ripple, Coinbase, and Crypto.com will be among the key participants in the program. This pilot program will particularly cater to tokenized non-cash collateral such as stablecoins. This decision also highlights the notable efforts of Acting Chair Caroline Pham, who previously proposed a CFTC pilot program designed as a regulatory sandbox to offer greater clarity for the crypto industry. Her initiative aimed to foster innovation while ensuring compliance within the evolving digital asset landscape.

This month, standout altcoins like Lightchain AI , Stellar, and Theta Network are generating buzz with their unique approaches and promising growth trajectories. Lightchain AI, with its cutting-edge integration of artificial intelligence and blockchain, has captured attention by projecting a remarkable 19,849% ROI as its token price climbs to $3. Stellar’s steady rise reflects its growing role in revolutionizing cross-border payments, offering speed and cost-efficiency on a global scale. Meanwhile, Theta Network is pushing the boundaries of digital content delivery with its decentralized approach, combining blockchain with edge computing. These altcoins showcase the diverse innovation driving the crypto space, making them top picks for forward-thinking investors seeking both utility and profitability in their portfolios. Stellars’s Rise: Transforming Cross-border Payments Stellar has solidified its reputation as a transformative force in the financial world by addressing the inefficiencies of traditional cross-border payment systems. Its blockchain network enables seamless, low-cost, and fast transactions between currencies, making it an ideal solution for global remittances and business-to-business payments. Stellar’s partnerships with financial institutions and technology firms, such as IBM, further bolster its credibility and adoption across various sectors. By prioritizing financial inclusion, Stellar allows unbanked and underbanked populations to access banking services, reducing barriers to entry for underserved regions. The platform’s native token, XLM, acts as a bridge currency, facilitating smooth conversions and minimizing costs for users. As blockchain adoption grows, Stellar’s innovative and practical approach to global payments positions it as a critical player in reshaping how money moves across borders efficiently and inclusively. Lightchain AI’s 19,849% ROI: Is it Sustainable? Lightchain AI’s impressive projected ROI of 19,849%, reaching a token price of $3, has captured the attention of the crypto community. This rapid growth stems from the platform’s unique fusion of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology, a combination designed to tackle scalability, privacy, and governance challenges. Its innovative Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism ensures that network contributions go beyond simple validations, focusing on meaningful AI computations. However, sustainability depends on the platform’s ability to maintain adoption, expand its ecosystem, and deliver on its roadmap milestones, including mainnet launch and cross-chain integrations.

Macro Strategy is designed to “bolster leading projects like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies that are at the forefront of reshaping global finance,” the project announced on X. Dear WLFI Community, We are thrilled to announce a transformative initiative that marks a significant milestone in our journey together. World Liberty Financial (WLFI) is proud to unveil the Macro Strategy, our strategic token reserve designed to bolster leading projects like… — WLFI (@worldlibertyfi) February 11, 2025 The newly formed reserve will serve as a “robust financial backbone for WLFI,” the platform added. The DeFi project initially revealed its strategic token reserve launch last week at the Ondo Finance’s summit in New York. Besides, the tokenized real-world asset platform also announced plans to introduce its own layer-1 blockchain. WLFI Macro Strategy Plan Seeks Partnerships From Financial Institutions World Liberty’s token reserve aims to mitigate market volatility risks, ensuring a resilient financial system. It also fosters growth by empowering users to invest in innovative projects, like decentralized finance and build a “well-capitalized reserve.” Further, the project has called for strategic partnerships with financial institutions to contribute tokenized asset to the Macro Strategy reserve. “In alignment with our mission to bridge traditional finance and decentralized finance, we are actively engaging with esteemed financial institutions to contribute tokenized assets to our reserve.” Financial institutions that collaborate will gain transparent exposure to the crypto community and can directly engage with WLFI community. President Trump and his affiliates own 60% stake in WLF holding company. The announcement arrives at a time when his family businesses are increasingly turning to making money from crypto, Reuters noted. For instance, the WLFI tokens give their holders a vote on decisions about product features, unlike other typical crypto investments. Cryptos like Bitcoin and Ether can be used for payments or developing applications. Additionally, President’s $TRUMP memecoin saw millions of dollars poured into entities connected to his new crypto ventures. Per Reuters data , the WLFI tokens have so far seen $500 million sales. World Liberty Financial launched two months ahead of the U.S. presidential election, stirring controversy on several fronts at the time.

His announcement ended years of speculation that the Fed might follow China’s lead by launching an official digital currency. During the Fed’s seminannual testimony , Powell addressed Sen. Bernie Moreno’s (R-Ohio) query to assure that the US would refrain from introducing a CBDC as long as he remains chairman. Powell replied positively. JUST IN: Fed Chair Powell commits to never creating a central bank digital currency (CBDC). pic.twitter.com/sGkf9oK7qT — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) February 11, 2025 CBDC Research Fails to Identify a Definite Requirement For at least four years, the Fed actively explored the concept of a CBDC, culminating in a detailed 2022 study that weighed both its potential benefits and drawbacks without drawing a firm conclusion. During this period, many officials expressed concerns, generally agreeing that a CBDC is unnecessary while highlighting privacy issues among other matters. Moreover, the complexity of implementing such a system, ongoing policy debates around privacy versus surveillance, the efficiency of the current US payment infrastructure and legal challenges over the Fed’s authority to create a CBDC without Congressional approval all argue against its introduction. In the meantime, the Fed has rolled out the FedNow payments system, which addresses many of the same challenges a CBDC would tackle. Additionally, during his testimony, Sen. Bernie Moreno urged Powell to expand the availability of 24-hour money transfers through FedNow. Powell to Serve Through 2026, Defying Calls for an Early Departure As debates over US monetary policy intensify, it’s important to note that Powell continues to lead the Fed. President Donald Trump originally appointed him in 2017, and he now serves a term through May 2026. Despite their public disagreements—particularly over interest rate decisions—President Joe Biden reappointed Powell for a second term in 2021. And although Trump has shown frustration with Powell’s policies in the past, he recently confirmed he wouldn’t try to replace him , remarking that Powell wouldn’t step down quietly. In November, Powell declared that he would not leave office early if Trump attempted to remove him, saying that the law forbids early dismissal of any Fed governor before their term ends. Powell and Trump United in Rejecting CBDCs However, Powell and Trump agree on rejecting a CBDC. Recently, Trump signed an executive order banning its creation . The order states: “Except to the extent required by law, any ongoing plans or initiatives at any agency related to the creation of a CBDC within the jurisdiction of the United States shall be immediately terminated, and no further actions may be taken to develop or implement such plans or initiatives.” Trump has consistently criticized CBDCs, arguing that they would give the government absolute control over personal finances.

PropiChain is an AI-driven blockchain platform revolutionizing real estate investment. While Ethereum faces price challenges, PropiChain is entering an untapped market, and offering game-changing technology with massive upside potential. Ethereum Price Faces Resistance as Growth Slows The Ethereum price movement has been disappointing in recent weeks. Currently, Ethereum is trading at $2,637, reflecting a 16.8% decline over the past week as it struggles to break past resistance. Layer-2 adoption is growing, but competition from newer, cheaper altcoins continues to threaten the Ethereum price’s dominance in the DeFi space. The Ethereum price ability to deliver explosive gains is now limited compared to early-stage projects with high-growth potential. This has led many investors to diversify into AI altcoins, particularly those with real-world applications, like PropiChain (PCHAIN) . PropiChain (PCHAIN): The AI Altcoin Gaining Momentum for a 30,000% Surge While the Ethereum price struggles, PropiChain (PCHAIN) is gaining serious momentum. Unlike Ethereum (ETH), which focuses on smart contracts and DeFi, PropiChain is transforming real estate investment through AI and blockchain-based automation. This platform brings efficiency, transparency, and accessibility to real estate investment, solving long-standing industry challenges. Traditionally, real estate transactions are slow, expensive, and require multiple intermediaries. PropiChain eliminates these inefficiencies by using blockchain technology to allow users to buy, sell, and manage properties. Every property is broken down into tradable tokens, allowing fractional ownership, immediate liquidity, and a transparent ownership record. This approach makes real estate investing as simple as trading cryptocurrencies. PropiChain (PCHAIN) also uses AI to enhance investment decisions. This AI scans market trends, identifies high-value investment opportunities, and provides real-time property valuations. This ensures that investors no longer rely on outdated models but instead gain access to automated insights that maximize profitability. Additionally, the AI-powered leasing and rental automation system allows for seamless management of properties, ensuring rental payments, lease renewals, and property maintenance are handled without human intervention. The metaverse integration further expands its capabilities. Investors can explore virtual property tours, attend real estate events, and connect with global markets in an immersive digital environment. The metaverse functionality removes geographical barriers, allowing users to participate in real estate investment on a global scale. Smart contracts further enhance the ecosystem by ensuring secure, tamper-proof, and instant transactions without intermediaries, reducing costs and increasing efficiency. PropiChain (PCHAIN) is officially listed on CoinMarketCap, increasing its visibility and credibility among serious investors. PropiChain (PCHAIN) provides a low-cost, high-speed alternative for real estate transactions. With a focus on real-world utility, PropiChain is positioning itself as the top AI altcoin with a strong foundation for sustained long-term growth. Why Analysts Predict PropiChain (PCHAIN) Could Outperform Ethereum (ETH) in 2025 The Ethereum price will likely continue growing, but its parabolic gains are behind it. For traders looking for exponential returns, PropiChain (PCHAIN) presents a rare opportunity to invest before mainstream adoption. Currently priced at just $0.011, PropiChain is still in its presale phase, making it one of the best entry points for early investors. The Ethereum price once provided this kind of early-stage opportunity, but today, the returns it offers pale in comparison to what early PropiChain adopters stand to gain. PropiChain (PCHAIN) has passed a full security audit by BlockAudit, verifying its smart contract integrity and ensuring that transactions on its network are secure and tamper-proof. With Ethereum price stagnating and AI emerging as the next major blockchain trend, analysts believe PropiChain’s growth curve could mirror Ethereum’s early breakout phase. PropiChain (PCHAIN) is the Next Big AI Altcoin As the Ethereum price struggles, traders are turning to high-growth alternatives with AI-driven innovation and real-world applications. PropiChain (PCHAIN) is emerging as a top contender targeting a $634 trillion market. With its presale price set at just $0.011, early adopters have a rare opportunity to enter before the next major rally begins. A $1,000 investment today will easily turn to $2,300 when PCHAIN reaches its next presale stage, and with a projected 30,000% surge, that $1,000 can yield over $300,000. This is the lowest price the PCHAIN token will ever be; so don’t miss out on the presale before the price skyrockets.

BNB Chain has unveiled its tech roadmap for 2025, outlining plans to integrate artificial intelligence into key areas of the network while enhancing transaction speeds and security. Originally developed by Binance, the blockchain aims to reduce transaction latency to sub-second speeds, introduce gasless transactions, and scale up to process 100 million transactions per day. Alongside these upgrades, the network is also addressing long-standing security issues, particularly those related to maximal extractable value exploits . The announcement, made on Feb. 11, triggered an immediate market response. BNB coin ( BNB ), the fifth-largest crypto by market cap, surged nearly 10% following the reveal. However, as of Feb. 12, the price has stabilized at $627. AI has already been a growing focus for the BNB Chain. Last month, the network introduced an AI Agent development solution, enabling automated on-chain decision-making, and launched Four.Meme, a platform designed to simplify meme coin creation. You might also like: Binance and SEC file to stay case for 60 days The 2025 roadmap builds on these efforts, highlighting AI’s role in smart contract development through tools like Code Copilot, an AI-driven assistant that helps developers deploy contracts more efficiently. Additionally, AI-integrated DataDAOs are expected to provide a new model for monetizing private datasets, incentivizing contributions while improving data security. While scalability and efficiency are central to the roadmap, security remains a top priority. MEV-related exploits, particularly sandwich attacks, have been a major concern for BNB Chain users. MEV, or maximal extractable value, refers to the additional profits validators can make by manipulating transaction orders, often by front-running trades. In 2024 alone, BNB Chain users lost an estimated $1.5 billion to such attacks, making it one of the network’s most pressing issues. Reflecting growing community concerns, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao recently posted a poll on X, asking users whether the network should take stronger action against MEV attacks. Should BNB Chain try to eliminate/aggressively reduce the MEV issues? — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) February 7, 2025 Meanwhile, user activity on BNB Chain has been surging. The Binance Smart Chain recently surpassed 500 million unique active addresses, according to a recent X post by Whale Insider. This increase coincided with the launch of TST, a test token created by BNB Chain’s team as part of an educational tutorial on the Four.Meme launchpad. TST got listed on Binance. A few thoughts: 1. CZ said “fundamentals”, then talks about a test coin turned meme coin. I posted to clarify that TST was NOT endorsed by me/us. It was just a test token used in a video tutorial. But every clarification post just made it more viral… — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) February 9, 2025 Though intended purely for demonstration purposes, speculation around the token unexpectedly drove trading activity, likely contributing to the rise in active addresses. As BNB Chain moves forward with its AI-first strategy, the coming months will be crucial in determining how effectively these proposed upgrades translate into real-world improvements.

Ethereum price trades around $2,600, making the recent outflow worth $2.9 billion. Moreover, the RSI of ETH/BTC has hit oversold on the monthly time frame for the first time. These signs, and many more, suggest that the downtrend will end, and a recovery rally will begin. 1.09M ETH Exits Exchanges, is Ethereum Price Bounce Next? Ethereum price has bounced off the $2,500 support level and is up 7% in the past two days. This bounce will likely extend in the coming days since 1.09 million ETH worth $2.9 billion has left centralized exchanges since February 2, according to Sanitment . Typically, when supply leaves centralized entities, it is considered bullish since it reduces the overhang and the available selling pressure. 1.09M ETH Leaves Exchanges In addition, many buy signals are flashing for the Ethereum price, both from an on-chain and technical perspective, indicating the end of its bearish outlook. 365-day MVRV Flashes Buy Signal for ETH For example, the 365-day MVRV ratio, which tracks the average profit/loss of investors who purchased ETH in the past year, is in the opportunity zone, hinting at a reversal. This metric hit -17.48% on February 7, indicating the average loss of investors who purchased ETH a year ago. The last time the 365-day MVRV dropped below -13.80% was in September 2024. Ethereum price rallied 88% in the next four months to $4,000. If history rhymes, ETH is due for an explosive recovery rally. ETH 365D MVRV While the on-chain metrics are clearly indicating a bullish outlook, let’s explore what technicals are noting. ETH/BTC RSI Hits Oversold Levels ETH/BTC’s monthly Relative Strength Index (RSI) has hit the oversold level for the first time in its history. Due to Bitcoin’s explosive move above $100K coupled with Ethereum’s lackluster performance throughout 2024 and 2025, the ETH/BTC ratio has continued to plummet and trades currently at 0.02. ETH/BTC RSI Hits Oversold For First Time in Ethereum’s History This significant development suggests that the sentiment surrounding ETH/BTC has reached an all-time low (ATL) and typically these phases do not last for long. A bounce in Ethereum price while BTC stagnates or drops could improve this ratio. Key Ethereum Price Levels to Watch Ethereum price currently trades around $2,700, up 7% in the past two days. If the ongoing recovery picks up steam, the next key but minor hurdles include the previous month and previous week VWAPs at $2,683 and $3,306, respectively. Clearing these two blockades will allow ETH’s value to scale up to $4,000, the next critical psychological level to book profits . With bullish Ethereum price predictions, investors can expect the altcoin to revisit ATH of $4,868 and, in some cases, go beyond and set up a new one at $5,000.

WallitIQ (WLTQ); Which Presale Token Should You Buy First For 10,000% Gains? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market thrives on timing. Finding the right presale token before it skyrockets is the key to life-changing gains. Currently, three names are making waves: $TLD, Rexas Finance (RXS), and WallitIQ (WLTQ) . But not all presale gems are created equal. One of these could turn early investors into future crypto millionaires. The question is, which one will deliver the coveted 10,000% gains? The Battle For The Best Presale Token $TLD claims to be a rising force, with a focus on GameFi applications. Rexas Finance (RXS) enters the scene, boasting asset-backed tokenization. But standing at the forefront is WallitIQ (WLTQ), an AI token engineered for both innovation and raw gains. The WallitIQ (WLTQ) price, at just $0.0420 per token, holds the strongest case for 10,000% gains. Its technology is leagues ahead, its roadmap is aggressive, and its early investors anticipate a price explosion. Where Does $TLD Stand? $TLD is riding the wave of hype in the GameFi space, but hype alone doesn’t guarantee returns. While its presale has attracted attention, concerns linger over its real-world utility. The token’s structure is sound, but compared to the rapid developments of WallitIQ (WLTQ), it struggles to inspire the same confidence level. Investors looking for gains above marketing buzz should ask: Does $TLD provide cutting-edge features that push the industry forward? Without groundbreaking tools like WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) AI-driven precision , the answer is clear. Rexas Finance (RXS) And Its Uncertain Path Rexas Finance (RXS) introduces an ambitious concept by tokenizing traditionally hard-to-access assets, allowing a broader range of investors to participate in once-exclusive markets. While this approach holds potential, its execution remains uncertain. Without a proven framework demonstrating smooth integration, speculation remains the primary driver of the Rexas Finance (RXS) presale. Meanwhile, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has already delivered an MVP for its Crypto Wallet Management Mobile App, providing an easy way to handle digital assets. This AI altcoin isn’t just selling potential; it’s demonstrating real-world functionality before launch. That’s the reliability investors need before betting on 10,000% gains. Why WallitIQ (WLTQ) Is The Only Logical Choice The secret to massive presale returns lies in choosing a token with real adoption potential. WallitIQ (WLTQ) isn’t just another speculative play. This AI altcoin is backed by transformational tools designed for high-value investors. Unlike $TLD and Rexas Finance (RXS), which still rely on outdated market strategies, this project allows investors to maximize their holdings by staking their utility tokens , turning long-term positions into passive income opportunities. Security and transparency define the next generation of tokens. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) Escrow Connect helps investors to execute transactions with absolute trust. This isn’t an empty promise; the platform is SolidProof-audited , guaranteeing that every contract operates without loopholes. Meanwhile, WallitIQ (WLTQ) investors are already securing 10,000% gains while others scramble to react. This platform doesn’t just provide explosive growth potential—it turns everyday transactions into wealth-building opportunities with cashback rates reaching up to 12%. While traders in $TLD and Rexas Finance (RXS) wait for the next move, those holding this AI altcoin are already profiting from market surges and passive earnings embedded into its ecosystem. Timing is everything. Presale prices are fleeting, and opportunities vanish fast. With WallitIQ (WLTQ) set to launch its beta platform soon, those waiting on the sidelines risk missing out on potential 10,000% gains entirely. Once early buyers lock in their tokens at $0.0420 , the window for entry slams shut. Buy WallitIQ (WLTQ) Now, Or Regret It Later? The crypto market rewards those who move fast. WallitIQ (WLTQ) is a powerhouse for financial freedom, not just a token. The next wave of wealth creation has already begun, and only those who seize this presale will witness the kind of gains that redefine portfolios. This is the moment when savvy investors act. At the same time, while $TLD and Rexas Finance (RXS) might sound appealing, they lack the momentum, features, and credibility driving WallitIQ (WLTQ) toward 10,000% gains. If you’re serious about securing 10,000% gains, there’s only one move to make: buy WallitIQ (WLTQ) before this opportunity disappears. The clock is ticking.

For traders using any of the affected pairs, this early notice allows ample time to adjust trading strategies and ensure a smooth transition before February 17. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Binance Lawsuit Paused, Is Ripple Next? SEC Crypto Task Force Head Hester Peirce Weighs In , Impact on Other Trading Pairs This delisting affects only the specified pairs. Binance has clarified that users can still trade these tokens through other active pairs on the platform. Users can still engage with HMSTR, SAGA, ILV, LTO, and MDT through different trading options within Binance Margin. Why Binance is Delisting These Pairs While Binance did not disclose specific reasons for the delisting, such decisions are typically based on factors like low trading volume and limited liquidity. Pairs with consistently low activity can create trading inefficiencies, making them less suitable for the platform. As part of its commitment to maintaining a good trading platform, Binance regularly reviews and adjusts its offerings. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

33767162,[object Object],1739338215,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,US SEC and Binance Request 60-Day Pause In Crypto Lawsuit: Here’s Why,https://bitcoinist.com/us-sec-and-binance-request-60-day-pause-in-crypto-lawsuit-heres-why/,"The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and global crypto exchange Binance have filed a joint motion to halt the ongoing legal battle for two months, citing the ongoing changes in the regulatory agency. SEC Vs Binance To Take A Pause On Tuesday, FOX Business journalist Eleanor Terrett reported that the US SEC and Binance had requested a 60-day pause on the regulator’s case against the global crypto exchange. The joint motion, dated February 10, 2025, argues that the litigation warrants a stay due to the creation of the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, led by SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce. The two parties consider that the Task Force, created by the Commission’s acting chair, Mark Uyeda, to help develop a regulatory framework for crypto assets, could “impact and facilitate the potential resolution of this case.” In June 2023, the SEC filed a lawsuit against the crypto exchange, arguing that Binance, its US affiliate, BAM Trading Services Inc., and the exchange’s former CEO, Changpeng Zhao, offered the sale of unregistered securities and had operated illegally in the US. The US watchdog argued that the lack of registration enabled Binance to allegedly run an unregulated trading platform that exposed US investors to significant risks and misled customers about the security and regulatory oversight of their assets. The exchange filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, alleging that the SEC had exceeded its legal authority, but Judge Amy Berman Jackson ruled against the motion in July 2024. Nonetheless, the judge granted Binance a partial victory after rejecting some of the Commission’s main claims. The court ruling dismissed the claims related to the secondary market sales of BNB tokens, the classification of Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin as an investment contract, and “the assertion that crypto tokens themselves are securities.” Despite this, Judge Jackson allowed the case to proceed with claims about the exchange’s staking program, BNB’s Initial Coin Offering (ICO) sales, and anti-fraud violations of the Securities Act. More Joint Motions To Come? According to the Monday court document, the regulatory agency proposed a brief stay with Binance, which the crypto exchange agreed to, considering it “appropriate and in the interest of judicial economy.” Moreover, the joint motion affirms the stay could “save the parties resources” if an early resolution is reached, removing the need to continue the merits discovery. Further, this brief stay will promote the efficient use of the Court’s resources, as a resolution would obviate the need for the Court to resolve the Defendants’ pending Motions to Dismiss the Amended Complaint. Following the 60-day stay, Binance and the SEC plan to submit a joint status report, including whether a continuation of the stay is warranted. Terret alleges that the joint stay motion is the first requested pause on crypto litigation in the courts since Uyeda became acting chair on January 20. The journalist added that she expects to see other non-fraud causes, such as Ripple, Coinbase, and Kraken, follow suit and request a motion stay.",Crypto News|binance|Binance Coin|Binance lawsuit|BNB|bnbusdt|Changpeng “CZ” Zhao|coinbase|Crypto Regulations|Hester Peirce|Mark Uyeda|ripple|SEC|SEC crypto task force|SEC vs Binance|US SEC|XRP,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-02-12 05:30:15

Why? Because RTX is not just a fun meme coin it actually helps people send money fast and cheap. Unlike SHIB and DOGE, which rely on hype, RTX has real-world use. With prices rising and experts predicting big gains, many believe RTX is the smarter choice for the future. Is Shiba Inu Ready for a Comeback? Smart Investors Are Watching Remittix Too! Shiba Inu (SHIB) is displaying some positive movement! Now at $0.00001623, the price rose eleven percent. Should SHIB exceed $0.00001790, it may find itself headed towards $0.00002000 or perhaps $0.00002200. Still, problems can develop if it comes under $0.000014. While SHIB is trying to recover, many investors are shifting their focus to Remittix (RTX). Unlike meme coins, Remittix has real-world use, making international payments faster and cheaper. It’s already gained 30,000 holders, and with a price of $0.0567, experts believe it could soar 4x soon. SHIB holders are now asking: Do I wait for SHIB to break out, or should I switch to something with real growth potential like Remittix? With big investors eyeing RTX, it might be the better bet for long-term success. Elon Musk’s Plan for DOGE and Why Investors Are Eyeing Remittix Too Elon Musk is working on making the government smaller and more efficient. His team, called DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency), is trying to fix wasteful spending. Musk says some government workers want to do the right thing but were stopped by bad management. He believes if they are given more power, they can save a lot of money and cut down on fraud. One of their main targets is the Treasury Department, where Musk thinks smarter decisions could make a big difference. He and his colleagues have been prohibited from viewing some crucial records for now, though, by a federal judge. DogeCoin (DOGE) is trading at $0.2543 while other investors are eagerly observing to see whether Musk’s involvement could raise its price. But while DOGE is gaining attention, many investors are also looking at Remittix (RTX). Unlike DOGE, Remittix has real-world use; it makes international payments faster and cheaper. It already has 30,000 holders and a price of $0.0567 with experts predicting huge growth. With Musk making moves in government and crypto, investors wonder: Will DOGE surge again or is Remittix the smarter choice for long-term success? Why Investors Are Watching Remittix Remittix is attracting a lot of attention because it solves a real problem sending money across borders quickly and cheaply. Currently, banks take days to process payments and charge high fees. Remittix changes that by offering a faster, more affordable way to send money. It simplifies the process by directly converting crypto to FIAT, helping businesses and individuals complete transactions in minutes instead of days. What makes Remittix stand out is its real-world use. It’s not merely another crypto motivated by hype or conjecture. Early on, the initiative has attracted over $11.6 million and is building investor trust. Many analysts believe RTX, with a current price of $0.0567, might rise up to 50 times its value as more people use its payment mechanism. Remittix is also committed to security. The team has tested the system rigorously and has locked funds for three years to prove their commitment. As the need for faster and cheaper global payments grows, Remittix is positioned to become a leader in the digital finance space. It’s a crypto with a real-world purpose, and investors are taking notice. Remittix Presale: A Game-Changer in Global Payments Remittix is revolutionizing cross-border payments with fast, low-cost transactions. With over $11.6 million raised and RTX at $0.0567 , early investors see massive potential. Don’t miss out, join the presale today and secure your spot in this financial revolution!

This early momentum signals strong demand, with investors seeking to book positions before the market gains wider exposure. Unlike other tokens that have trouble gaining traction, 1Fuel’s meteoric rise suggests it could be a serious contender in the months ahead. Let’s explore why traders are locking in early gains and what could happen once 1Fuel reaches top exchanges. Binance Coin (BNB): A Pillar of the Crypto Ecosystem As the backbone of the Binance ecosystem, BNB has been a dominating power in the crypto space. As at time of writing, BNB shows a strong recovery from its early-month drop with its trading price set at $632.33. For some, BNB is still the go to asset for trading with its high of $644.32 and low of $609.70 highlighting even when market fluctuates BNB still has long term value. Through its role in transaction fee reductions, staking, and token sales on Binance Launchpad, BNB’s reputation has been cemented. While still a stable choice, investors are on the look for emerging DeFi assets poised to grow exponentially. That’s where 1Fuel enters the picture. Compared to BNB, utilized in a centralized exchange ecosystem, 1Fuel is creating a decentralized structure with unprecedented presale traction, suggesting it’s a more alluring option for those aiming to maintain staying away from the traditional exchange owned assets. RLUSD: Stability Meets Market Expansion As a trusted asset for cross border payments, Ripple’s RLUSD , a USD pegged stablecoin, has risen in popularity. With intraday trading movements ranging between $0.99 and $1.005, it shows the ability to remain stable as it is currently trading at $1. RLUSD has become increasingly popular with traders who are hedging against market volatility, but now some of them are beginning to allocate some of their holdings to high growth assets. While stablecoins provide security, they do not offer growth potential that traders often crave. With 1Fuel being a blueprint for emerging DeFi assets, RLUSD traders are now paying attention to it as a method to invest in early DeFi without the high fees and congestion fees associated with other platforms. 1Fuel has seen unparalleled presale momentum with many signs that adoption will be accelerating, so it could soon be on the map of bigger institutional investors. 1Fuel (OFT): The New Player Set for Explosive Growth BNB’s reliability, RLUSD’s stability, and 1Fuel’s potential growth speak for themselves. 1Fuel is currently in presale and already over $2 million has been raised, token prices increasing from $0.010 up to $0.018. There is real utility behind the hype, 1Fuel is focused on affordable transactions, cross chain functionality and privacy enhancing swaps, and is positioning itself as one of the most exciting upcoming DeFi assets of the year. Unlike most new projects, 1Fuel’s unmatchable presale momentum is backed by the growing adoption of traders who realise the need for fast, secure, private transactions. With its integrated wallet exchange model, it guarantees that users can trade efficiently without the bottlenecks observed in other DeFi platforms. When it lists on top tier exchanges, the expectation is that interest from institutional and retail investors will activate a notable price surge for 1Fuel . Conclusion With a major exchange listing looming, the strength of the 1Fuel demand is already clear and could signal an even higher price if 1Fuel does end up gaining some serious momentum.

NFTs aren't as trending as they were in early 2022 when LinksDAO sold its membership tokens for $10 million. The market euphoria that led raunchy Beeple artwork to nab hundreds of millions of dollars at auction moved on long, long ago. CryptoSlam's NFT Index is down nearly 97% since its inception in January 2022, showing how market interest is now elsewhere. Memecoins now dominate crypto's short attention span economy; even Trump has one. Now LinksDAO will have one too, with LINKS. ""We are going to be launching a community token that has deep culture, that's embedded in the game of golf, that's embedded in the community, and that's permissible under the fucking regulations that we have to deal with,"" LinksDAO founder Mike Dudas said on a community call late Tuesday. The coin is expected to launch in the coming months on the Base blockchain. A third of its supply is earmarked for LinksDAO NFT holders, with smaller allocations for members of other NFT communities, including Pudgy Penguins and Bored Ape Yacht Club. Any successful crypto coin inevitably lives or dies as a financial instrument, even when its promoters – right up to the President of the United States – attempt to insist otherwise in the fine print. For their part, LinksDAO's suits proclaimed LINKS was not ""speculative"" nor an investment. Instead, they're calling it a community ""enhancer:"" a way to broaden the reach of a crypto club that managed to weather the bear market less because of the enduring appeal of NFTs than the growing power of golf. ""The goal is to have every single golfer have LINKS in their crypto wallet,"" said head of community and co-founder Cooper Sherwin. LinksDAO bought a golf club in Scotland in mid-2023. The club's executives recently signed an agreement to become partial owners of a second course in Kansas City. That deal is subject to a vote by LinksDAO's NFT-holding members, said Sherwin. Hillcrest Golf Course is an 18-hole course designed by an architect from golf's so-called Golden Age, Donald Ross in 1915. He once called it the finest course in the world, but it fell into disrepair over the ensuing century, according to project members. That created an opportunity for LinksDAO to cut a deal. Current owner Robb Heineman – a Kansas City businessman who also owns that city's Major League Soccer team – closed the club down for a few years back to pursue a $30 million renovation project. Heineman did not return a call from CoinDesk. In a press release, he said LinksDAO ""shares our forward-thinking vision for what a golf club can be."" LinksDAO will become a minority owner of Hillcrest and gain a board seat, though project leads declined to share specific financials behind the deal. The deal will seek the approval of LinksDAO's NFT holding members, who vote on proposals but don't have full legal power over the project's decisions. Some 200 members showed up on Tuesday night to hear the dual announcement of course acquisition and token. That means LinksDAO is not actually a ""decentralized autonomous organization,"" but instead a kind of affinity club for people at the intersection of crypto and golf. Hillcrest's national membership program will become a LinksDAO operation open only to holders of its NFTs.",Markets|NFT|Memecoin|DAO,EN,0,0,MARKET|SPONSORED|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-12 05:36:02

Meanwhile, the SEC is asking for public feedback on allowing in-kind creations and redemptions for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, which could boost tax efficiency and institutional adoption. Additionally, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell completely ruled out issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) during his term, which is similar to many Republican lawmakers' stance against a digital dollar. SEC Cannot Set Crypto Agenda Without Confirmed Leadership The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to delay setting a regulatory agenda for digital assets until the Senate confirms a new chair, according to Commissioner Hester Peirce. At a Federalist Society panel on Feb. 11, Peirce said that it will be “a little premature” for the SEC to move forward without a confirmed chair who could lead the agency’s approach to cryptocurrency regulation. The Federalist Society panel included: Since the departure of former chair Gary Gensler on Jan. 20, Mark Uyeda has taken over as acting chair. However, the Senate is expected to vote soon on President Donald Trump’s nominee , former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins. Peirce acknowledged that Uyeda was effectively managing the commission’s current agenda but suggested that a confirmed chair will need some time to establish their own regulatory priorities. (Source: Donald Trump ) Trump nominated Atkins to serve as an SEC commissioner for a term ending in June of 2031, but the Senate Banking Committee has yet to advance his nomination. If approved, he will lead the financial regulator and set its course on key issues like cryptocurrency oversight. Peirce also pointed out that the SEC was still working to determine the best path forward for digital asset rulemaking, particularly in light of a recent appellate court ruling that criticized the agency’s handling of a rulemaking request from Coinbase. After the creation of the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, the agency requested delays in at least two enforcement cases, which indicates that the ongoing regulatory deliberations could actually influence its approach. An Illinois judge granted the SEC a 30-day extension in its case against Cumberland DRW, while a request for a delay in its lawsuit against Binance was still pending in a District of Columbia court. Peirce and Uyeda are both Republican commissioners, and currently serve alongside Democratic Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw. It is still unclear whether Trump plans to nominate a fifth commissioner to round out the SEC’s leadership if Atkins is confirmed. SEC Considers Making Crypto ETFs More Efficient The SEC is also seeking public comments on a proposal that will allow Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to create and redeem shares using spot cryptocurrency rather than cash. According to a filing on Feb. 10, the move could greatly impact ETF tax efficiency and institutional adoption. The proposal follows an amended application that was submitted on Feb. 5 by the Cboe BZX Exchange to permit in-kind creations and redemptions for the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF and the 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF. In-kind creations and redemptions allow ETF issuers to exchange shares directly for the underlying assets, which is a practice common in traditional ETFs for improved tax efficiency. Currently, the SEC has not allowed such a mechanism for spot cryptocurrency ETFs, which could change if regulators approve the proposal. Industry participants argue that allowing in-kind redemptions will boost after-tax performance and increase demand among institutional investors. The request was made during a wave of crypto-related ETF proposals. In January, Nasdaq asked for SEC approval to enable in-kind creations and redemptions for BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, which is the largest spot Bitcoin ETF with approximately $57 billion in assets under management. In contrast, ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF holds around $5 billion, while the 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF has $20 million. As seen from some of the latest developments, the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency ETFs could shift under the new US administration, especially as Donald Trump signaled a much more favorable stance toward the industry. After his election victory and inauguration on Jan. 20, expectations rose that US regulators may ease restrictions on crypto-based investment products. Asset managers have also already filed for several new ETFs holding altcoins like Solana, XRP, and Litecoin. Additionally, issuers are awaiting approval for crypto index ETFs that are designed to track baskets of digital assets. Analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence believe that there is a very strong chance of approval for the proposed changes and new crypto ETF filings. If approved, the shift toward in-kind creations and redemptions could be a turning point in the evolution of crypto investment vehicles, and could pave the way for even more institutional participation. Jerome Powell Rules Out CBDC Under His Leadership Despite the optimism surrounding Trump’s regulatory picks, there are still limits to what this leadership is willing to do. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell recently assured US lawmakers that the central bank will not issue a central bank digital currency (CBDC) while he is in charge. At a Senate Banking Committee meeting on Feb. 11, Powell responded to questions from Ohio Senator Bernie Moreno, and confirmed that a digital dollar will not be introduced during his term, which runs until May of 2026. His statement was one of the strongest rejections of a CBDC from the Fed to date. Powel during the Semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress The Senate hearing focused on a semiannual monetary policy report to Congress, and Powell also addressed concerns about debanking policies. Senators Tim Scott and Cynthia Lummis asked questions about financial institutions allegedly being pressured by government agencies to cut off services to crypto firms. Powell indicated that the Fed will reassess its approach to such policies. Powell’s remarks are a shift from his previous stance. During a March 2024 hearing in a Democratic-controlled Senate, he stated that the US was ”nowhere near recommending or let alone adopting a central bank digital currency in any form,” but stopped short of an outright refusal. His latest statement aligns with the broader stance of Republican lawmakers, who have made preventing the launch of a digital dollar a policy priority. With Republicans controlling the House, Senate, and White House, efforts to block a US CBDC have gained a lot of traction. President Donald Trump even issued an executive order on Jan. 23 that bans the establishment, issuance, and use of a digital dollar, though legal experts have debated the extent of his authority to enforce such a measure. Additionally, an anti-CBDC bill introduced by Representative Tom Emmer passed the House in May of 2024 along largely partisan lines and is currently awaiting action in the Senate Banking Committee. It is still uncertain if the legislation will advance during the 119th session of Congress.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BTC|FIAT|EXCHANGE|ETH,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-12 05:52:05

Andrade claims the IRS failed to properly notify him before requesting his financial records. In a February 10 legal brief to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals , the IRS and the Department of Justice (DOJ) argued that the court lacks jurisdiction over Andrade’s case, as there was no formal legal proceeding against him. The dispute originates from an IRS investigation into Andrade’s firm, ABTC Corporation, for potential violations of financial reporting laws under the Bank Secrecy Act. IRS Investigation and Andrade’s Challenge The case dates back to 2021, when the IRS began investigating ABTC Corp. to determine whether Andrade was involved in financial misconduct. In May 2023, the agency issued summonses to Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, requesting financial records related to Andrade and ABTC. Andrade later argued that the IRS violated the Right to Financial Privacy Act (RFPA) by failing to provide proper notification before seeking his records. According to court filings, Andrade’s attorney discovered the summonses independently and requested copies from the IRS. In September 2023, the agency reissued the summonses, this time sending notifications to Andrade’s business address. However, those notices were returned as undeliverable in October 2023. In February 2024, Andrade filed a lawsuit in Texas seeking to invalidate the IRS summonses, claiming the agency had violated his financial privacy rights. In May 2024, a district court ruled against Andrade, finding that the IRS had complied with RFPA requirements by issuing new summonses and notifications. The court also noted that the case was moot since the banks had already complied with the IRS requests and turned over Andrade’s financial records. Following the decision, Andrade appealed the ruling to the Fifth Circuit in August, requesting a stay to prevent the IRS from reviewing his bank records while the appeal is ongoing. In its February 10 brief, the IRS and DOJ pushed back, arguing that the IRS had substantially complied with the RFPA, making Andrade ineligible for damages or attorney’s fees, which are only granted in cases of statutory violations. The case remains pending in the Fifth Circuit, with the court expected to decide whether to hear Andrade’s appeal or uphold the district court ruling. Andrade’s Legal History This is not Andrade’s first legal battle. In 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged him, then CEO of the NAC Foundation, with conducting an unregistered securities offering for AML Bitcoin, a token marketed as an enhanced version of Bitcoin. The SEC accused Andrade of misleading investors and violating securities laws. Last year, the Blockchain Association, in collaboration with the Texas Blockchain Council, launched a lawsuit against the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) over its latest cryptocurrency regulations. The legal challenge pushed back against the IRS’ new rules requiring brokers to report digital asset transactions, which are set to take effect in 2027.

Bitcoin miners have recently scaled back their sales activity following a period in which they took advantage of the market rally to cover operational costs, according to the company. Alphractal noted that the Bitcoin Miner Selling Pressure metric, which compares BTC outflows to average reserves over time, shows a decrease in liquidations, suggesting that less BTC is being dumped by miners and that overall supply pressure in the market is decreasing. “Following a period of heavy selling, values are currently trading below average, indicating a tightening of miner-sourced supply,” the firm said. Related News: Giant Cryptocurrency Whale Lost Big on This Altcoin: $12 Million Evaporated Despite the decrease in selling pressure, Alphractal also pointed to an increase in Bitcoin’s mining difficulty, which could eventually prompt miners to sell again. Higher difficulty means fiercer competition among miners, which in turn leads to increased operational expenses. Under normal circumstances, this would result in more BTC being sold to cover costs. However, Alphractal suggested that since many miners have already liquidated some of their holdings, they may now be choosing to hold BTC in anticipation of higher prices. However, if mining difficulty continues to rise, new waves of selling pressure could emerge. *This is not investment advice.

Brian Quintenz, a former commissioner at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, is expected to return as chairman following his selection by U.S. President Donald Trump, according to Bloomberg. If confirmed, he would serve a term running until April 13, 2029, returning to the agency at a time when crypto regulation is a central issue in financial policy. His nomination aligns with broader efforts by the Trump administration to reshape regulatory oversight of digital assets and derivatives markets. Quintenz previously served as a Republican commissioner at the CFTC from 2017 to 2021, playing a key role in overseeing the launch of the first fully regulated Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) futures contracts. You might also like: Super Bowl betting, Polish central bank rejects Bitcoin, MicroStrategy rebrands | Weekly Recap During his tenure, he emerged as a strong advocate for a pro-innovation regulatory framework, pushing for clear, well-defined rules that would encourage institutional adoption of digital assets while maintaining market integrity. His stance earned him comparisons to SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce—dubbed “Crypto Mom” in industry circles—for her similar advocacy of crypto-friendly regulation. After leaving the CFTC, Quintenz joined Andreessen Horowitz’s (a16z) crypto division in December 2022, where he led policy efforts to influence U.S. crypto regulations. The venture capital giant, which has investments in projects like Solana ( SOL ), Uniswap ( UNI ), Lido DAO ( LDO ), Optimism ( OP ), and EigenLayer ( EIGEN ), has consistently pushed for CFTC oversight of digital assets rather than SEC jurisdiction. The crypto industry has long viewed the CFTC as a more accommodating regulator compared to the SEC, which has taken a stricter enforcement-driven approach under Chair Gary Gensler. The nomination follows months of speculation. In December, reports surfaced that Trump was considering Quintenz among other candidates for the role. Meanwhile, Trump’s newly appointed AI and Crypto Czar, David Sacks, has outlined plans to work with Congress on market structure legislation, signaling a push for clearer digital asset regulations. Quintenz’s return could mark a shift in how the $400 trillion derivatives market, which includes a growing share of crypto-related products, is regulated. Acting CFTC Chair Caroline Pham has expressed support for the nomination, stating that she worked with Quintenz on key initiatives during his previous tenure and believes he will bring the same focus on crypto and innovation back to the agency. 🚨SCOOP: Three sources with direct knowledge of the matter tell me that @realDonaldTrump has chosen @BrianQuintenz , current Head of Policy at @a16z crypto and a former commissioner, to be permanent chair of the @CFTC .

Trump Talks To Ripple CEO About National XRP Reserve,https://coinpedia.org/sponsored/xrp-price-prediction-trump-ripple-national-reserve-plutochain/,"The post XRP News Today: 15$ XRP Imminent? Trump Talks To Ripple CEO About National XRP Reserve appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP is back in the spotlight as reports surface about former President Donald Trump meeting with Ripple’s CEO to discuss a potential national XRP reserve. This development has fueled speculation about regulatory clarity and institutional adoption, which might drive bullish price predictions. With growing interest in digital assets, could XRP hit $15 soon? Meanwhile, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) , a Bitcoin Layer-2 scaling solution, might gain attention for its fast transactions and cross-chain capabilities. Can Bitcoin’s next major upgrade come from PlutoChain? Let’s first break down the XRP price prediction below. XRP Price Prediction – Could Trump’s Meeting Push XRP to $15? XRP is once again making headlines as reports suggest Donald Trump met with Ripple’s CEO to discuss the possibility of integrating XRP into the U.S. financial system. This speculation has ignited bullish sentiment, with some Binance analysts suggesting a major price breakout could be on the horizon. With institutional interest growing and regulatory clarity improving, XRP could see a surge toward the $15 mark. Technical indicators point to key resistance levels around $3.50 and $7 before a possible move higher. Could this be the catalyst that sends XRP to new highs? Here’s How PlutoChain Could Expanding Bitcoin’s Scalability and Cross-Chain Functionality Bitcoin has long been the gold standard, but its scalability issues have prevented it from evolving beyond a store of value. PlutoChain might step in with a Layer-2 solution that’s designed to enhance Bitcoin’s efficiency without compromising security or decentralization. PlutoChain could significantly reduce congestion and speed up settlement times by introducing 2-second block times and the ability to process 43,200 transactions per day. Beyond faster transactions, PlutoChain integrates Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility, which allows developers to deploy Ethereum-based dApps and smart contracts directly onto Bitcoin. This could create new opportunities for DeFi applications, NFT marketplaces, and cross-chain financial solutions within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Decentralization remains a core focus, with PlutoChain incorporating a governance model where users can propose and vote on network upgrades. This might ensure that future developments align with community needs rather than centralized entities. Security is another priority, with PlutoChain undergoing comprehensive audits from leading firms like SolidProof, QuillAudits, and Assure DeFi. These measures reinforce trust and reliability and address concerns about vulnerabilities in Layer-2 solutions. PlutoChain might unlock new functionalities for Bitcoin by bridging the gap between Bitcoin and Ethereum, which could make it a more versatile blockchain ecosystem. If adoption continues to rise, PlutoChain could play a major role in reshaping Bitcoin’s future. Final Words As speculation grows around a potential national XRP reserve, Trump’s meeting with Ripple’s CEO has ignited discussions about XRP’s long-term value. If regulatory clarity and institutional adoption accelerate, XRP’s price could see significant upside, with some users eyeing the $15 mark as a possible target.

In an unusual move, zkLend publicly addressed the hacker via an X post , offering a 10% white hat bounty if the remaining 90% of the stolen funds are returned. This translates to the hacker keeping 10% while returning approximately 3,300 ETH to the specified Ethereum address. CertiK Alert reported that zkLend on Starknet experienced multiple attack transactions, resulting in the theft of approximately $5 million. The stolen funds were bridged to Ethereum via the address 0x04d7191dc8eac499bac710dd368706e3ce76c9945da52535de770d06ce7d3b26. A Deal to Waive Liability According to zkLend’s statement , if the hacker agrees with the request and returns the funds, the platform will waive any legal liabilities related to the attack. However, if no response is received by 00:00 UTC on February 14, 2025, zkLend has warned that it will proceed with legal actions, collaborating with security firms and law enforcement to track and prosecute the hacker. Withdrawals Suspended, Investigation Ongoing In response to the breach, zkLend has suspended all withdrawal functions on its protocol to prevent further risks. The team is working closely with security firms, including StarkWare Ltd, Starknet Foundation, zeroshadow.io (formerly Chainalysis Incident Response), Binance Security Team, and Hypernative Labs. They are actively tracking the stolen funds and investigating the root cause of the exploit. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto News: Alabama Man Pleads Guilty to SEC Twitter Hack , Community Reactions and Concerns The crypto community has reacted strongly to the incident. A crypto user pointed out that the stolen funds can’t be quickly moved to the mainnet due to the 12-hour withdrawal wait time required by the STARK official bridge. The user emphasized that the project team must ensure the funds are recovered, hinting at suspicions of internal involvement if the recovery fails. However, zkLend has promised full transparency throughout the investigation. They plan to release a comprehensive post-mortem report once the analysis is complete. The platform reassured its community that user trust remains a top priority, and they are doing everything possible to resolve the situation swiftly and securely. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Ethereum approaches $3,000 while Cardano declines and Rollblock sees a 420% surge, here’s what’s happening. Table of Contents Rollblock is aiming for big gains in the next bull run Can ETH reach the 3k mark? Cardano is falling to new depths Conclusion Ethereum (ETH)​ іs pushing toward the $3,000 mark, but can​ іt break through? Meanwhile, Cardano(ADA) has struggled, dropping 35%​ іn the last​ 30 days​ as investors look for better opportunities. Meanwhile, Rollblock (RBLK) is surging 420% as its GambleFi platform gains momentum. With Ethereum aiming higher, ADA slipping, and Rollblock skyrocketing, the market is heating up. Here’s what’s happening. Rollblock is aiming for big gains in the next bull run Rollblock is gearing up for massive gains in the next bull run. This project is making big moves in GambleFi, shaking up online gaming with its blockchain-powered casino. We’re talking 7,000+ games and 150+ sports betting markets, all secured by Ethereum tech, so every bet is fair and tamper-proof. People are noticing, and 45,000 users have already jumped in, and the presale just smashed past $10 million. December alone saw a 600% spike in sign-ups, with $1.75 million in bets placed on all types of games and sports. So what’s driving the hype? Rollblock’s revenue-sharing model is a game-changer. 30% of revenue goes into buying back RBLK tokens, with 60% burned to boost scarcity and 40% handed out as staking rewards. That means some of the best APYs seen in crypto, and we’re talking about ADA here. Right now, RBLK is in stage 10 of its presale, priced at $0.053. You might also like: Cryptos to watch before market reversal: Mantra, Litecoin, and Rollblock Can ETH reach the 3k mark? Ethereum’s price has been all over the place lately. In the past 30 days, it’s bounced between $3,300 and $2,700, making it a rollercoaster ride for investors. With an 18% drop in that time, the ETH price is clearly following the same bearish trend as most cryptos right now. The big question is, can it hit $3k? So far, ETH has been struggling to break through, getting rejected every time it gets close. But here’s the thing: if it can push past $2,800, breaking resistance, $3k is almost guaranteed. Cardano is falling to new depths Cardano (ADA) is definitely having a rough time. It just dropped below the $0.80 mark, a key support level, and things aren’t looking great. In the last 30 days, ADA has fallen 27.24%, and with a 5.25% drop in market cap, a recovery seems pretty tough right now. But there’s still hope. If ADA can climb back to $0.80, it could push toward $1. And if momentum builds, the next big resistance level sits at $1.20, a price ADA already smashed through in the last bull run, gaining 200% back then. If the market flips bullish, history might just repeat itself. Conclusion Ethereum is fighting to break $3,000, Cardano is struggling to recover, but Rollblock is stealing the spotlight with its massive 420% surge. While top cryptos are stuck in a bearish trend, RBLK is aiming hard for the next bull run, and investors are piling in. With its unique GambleFi model and revenue-sharing system, this could be the biggest opportunity of 2025.

Meanwhile, markets continued to assess the potential impact of President Donald Trump’s latest tariff escalation. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 0.46% to 39,900, while the broader Topix Index slipped 0.2% to 2,725 in mixed trading on Wednesday, as Japanese stocks struggled for direction following a one-day holiday. The Japanese yen weakened past 153 per dollar on Wednesday, reaching a one-week low after Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda provided no clear guidance on the future trajectory of interest rates. China ( SHCOMP ) rose 0.23% to around 3,320 and the Shenzhen Component adding 0.2% to 10,580, as optimism around artificial intelligence continued to fuel market enthusiasm. The rally was particularly driven by the AI breakthrough of Chinese startup DeepSeek, which developed a more efficient model compared to Western counterparts. The offshore yuan ticked lower to around 7.31 per dollar as investors remained cautious amid growing concerns over an escalating trade war. Hong Kong ( HSI ) rose 1.87% to 21,685 in early trade on Wednesday, swinging from a 1.0% fall in the previous session amid solid gains across sectors. India ( SENSEX ) fell 0.65% to 75,822 in early deals on Wednesday, retreating for the sixth straight session while lingering at their nearly two-week low amid concerns over US tariffs and the Q3 earnings outlook. The Indian rupee ( USD:INR ) rose for the third consecutive session on Wednesday, hovering around 86.7 and reaching a nearly two-week high amid central bank intervention. Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.60% largely unchanged on Wednesday, struggling for direction. The Australian dollar strengthened past $0.63 on Wednesday, approaching its highest level in eight weeks. In the U.S., on Tuesday, all three major indexes ended mixed amid President Trump’s latest tariff escalation and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s comments suggesting the central bank is in no rush to cut interest rates further. U.S. stock futures were little changed on Wednesday as investors braced for the release of the latest consumer inflation data: Dow -0.06%; S&P 500 -0.08%; Nasdaq -0.05%.

A new survey from the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum and Giesecke+Devrient shows that 67% of central banks haven’t changed their stance on CBDCs , even as nearly 30% have pushed back their timelines. But some hesitation is growing as15% are now less inclined to issue one, up from 0% in 2022, Reuters notes . The survey highlights a “clear hesitancy around the subject,” adding that “very few (central banks) have so far taken the decision to issue, despite a great deal of exploratory work.” Privacy remains a big concern. Critics argue that CBDCs could let governments keep tabs on transactions. Pushback grew after President Donald Trump banned work on a digital dollar in January. Then on Feb. 11, Fed Chair Jerome Powell doubled down , confirming there won’t be a CBDC as long as he’s in charge. Yet, for those still pushing ahead, “preserving central bank monetary sovereignty” is a key motivation, the report reads. “CBDCs hold significant potential for advancing the digital economy. By offering a public infrastructure, central banks can pave the way for innovative financial products and services, while reducing fragmentation in the financial system.” G+D Currency Technology chief executive Wolfram Seidemann You might also like: Retail CBDCs fail to address real consumer needs, survey shows Adoption, however, remains an issue.

Back in September 2024, the U.S.-based Atlantic Council think tank reported that 134 countries were looking into CBDCs in some way, up from just 35 in May 2020.

The accused, all Russian nationals, reportedly deployed ransomware on the networks of 17 Swiss companies between April 2023 and October 2024, a Feb. 10 report from local media outlet The Nation Thailand said. For those unaware, ransomware attacks involve hackers locking up a victim’s data and demanding a payout—usually in crypto—to restore access. In this case, the hackers allegedly used the Phobos malware, the report added. The accused were reportedly part of the Russian ransomware group 8Base and were also responsible for stealing approximately $16 million worth of Bitcoin from around 1,000 victims worldwide. According to Pol Lt Gen Trairong Phiewphan, commissioner of the Cyber Crime Investigation Bureau, the suspects were wanted by both U.S. and Swiss authorities. Thai police, in coordination with immigration officials, tracked them down in Phuket and seized over 40 items of evidence, including laptops, smartphones, and digital wallets.

The key is getting in early on high-potential projects before they explode in value. With meme coins still dominating crypto discussions, the right picks could bring insane returns, and that’s exactly why you’re here. One of the biggest presales right now is BTFD Coin (BTFD), which has already raised over $6 million and is making waves with its referral program that rewards investors with extra BTFD tokens. But that’s not the only token catching attention. Apu Apustaja (APU), Degen (DEGEN), and ANDY are also emerging as some of the best 100x cryptos in the market today. Let’s dive into why these four tokens could be massive winners. BTFD Coin: The Referral Program That Rewards Early Investors BTFD Coin isn’t just riding the meme wave—it’s actively rewarding early adopters through its referral program, allowing investors to earn 10% extra BTFD tokens by referring others. With over 69 billion tokens sold, $6 million raised, and 10,500+ holders, the momentum behind this project is undeniable. The referral program works like this: If someone uses your unique referral code and buys at least $50 worth of BTFD tokens, they get an extra 10% bonus. But here’s where it gets interesting—you also get 10% of their purchase in BTFD tokens if you rank in the top 20 on the leaderboard by the end of the month. Imagine sharing your referral link with just a few friends and watching your token stash grow—without spending extra. Now, let’s break down what an early investment could look like. Say you put in $12,000 at $0.00016 per BTFD token. That gets you 75 million BTFD tokens. Once the presale ends, BTFD will launch at $0.0006 per token, making that initial investment worth $45,000. And if analysts’ predictions are right, and BTFD hits $0.006 post-listing, your $12,000 could turn into $450,000. Buying BTFD is simple. Investors just need a MetaMask or Trust Wallet, some BNB, ETH, or USDT, and a few clicks to secure their tokens before the presale ends. Visit BTFD Coin buy page today and get in before it’s too late! Why did this coin make it to this list? BTFD Coin’s referral program, high-earning potential, and presale performance make it one of the most exciting meme coins of 2025. Apu Apustaja: The Meme Coin With a Cult Following Apu Apustaja (APU) is a meme token with deep internet culture roots. Unlike generic meme coins, APU represents a younger, more innocent version of Pepe the Frog, attracting investors who want to be part of a community-driven movement. The project is built on strong meme culture, and its following continues to grow as it becomes a symbol of meme purity and nostalgia. Early investors see this as an opportunity to get in before it gains mass adoption. Why did this coin make it to this list? APU taps into an existing meme movement, giving it long-term staying power in the meme coin space. Degen: The Gateway to DeFi and Meme Culture Degen (DEGEN) is more than just a meme token—it’s a crypto asset that provides access to decentralized finance (DeFi). Investors who hold DEGEN can explore staking, yield farming, and other DeFi opportunities without relying on traditional finance. The Degen community is highly engaged, and the project has built a strong reputation for rewarding long-term holders. As more investors look for meme coins with real utility, DEGEN’s connection to DeFi could help it maintain long-term relevance. Why did this coin make it to this list? Degen combines meme culture with DeFi accessibility, giving investors multiple reasons to hold long-term. ANDY: The Meme Coin Backed by Social Media Hype ANDY is a Solana-based meme coin inspired by Matt Furie’s iconic Boy’s Club characters, including Pepe the Frog. With an already established meme fanbase, ANDY has become a favorite in the Solana ecosystem, attracting thousands of investors. The hype around ANDY has been amplified by social media influencers, with figures like Andrew Tate bringing more visibility to the project. Meme coins thrive on viral moments, and ANDY’s strong online presence has made it a high-potential investment for meme coin traders. Why did this coin make it to this list? ANDY has strong social media backing, meme credibility, and a rapidly growing investor base. Final Words The best 100x cryptos have two things in common—strong community backing and high-earning potential. BTFD Coin’s referral program, APU’s deep meme roots, DEGEN’s DeFi integration, and ANDY’s social media hype all position these tokens as top contenders for exponential growth. With BTFD’s presale in its final stages, this could be one of the last chances to grab tokens before the price increases. Get in early and start stacking rewards through the referral program now. FAQs How does the BTFD Coin referral program work? BTFD Coin’s referral program rewards both referrers and buyers. If someone uses your unique referral code and buys $50 or more, they receive an extra 10% BTFD bonus. If you make it into the top 20 on the leaderboard, you’ll earn 10% of the total raise from referrals in BTFD tokens. Is Apu Apustaja (APU) based on the Pepe meme? Yes, APU is a variation of Pepe the Frog that represents a younger, kinder version of the meme. It has gained a strong following due to its wholesome meme culture appeal. Why is DEGEN different from other meme coins? DEGEN offers more than just memes—it provides access to DeFi solutions like staking and yield farming, making it a mix of meme culture and real financial utility. What gives ANDY its value? ANDY’s connection to Matt Furie’s Boy’s Club universe and strong social media presence have helped it gain rapid adoption, making it one of the most popular meme coins on Solana.

The securities regulator will be facing the litmus test on Friday, February 14, to determine whether the digital assets trading on Coinbase qualify as securities. Coinbase Lawsuit on Pause While US SEC Response to Appeal Is Pending In the case of the Binance vs SEC lawsuit , both parties decided to pause the proceedings in the wake of the SEC’s crypto task force. The Coinbase lawsuit is likely to face a similar scenario moving ahead. Last month, Judge Failla granted Coinbase permission to file an interlocutory appeal, allowing the Second Circuit Court to determine whether existing securities laws apply to the digital assets traded on Coinbase’s platform. Now, the US SEC under the new leadership of Mark Uyeda is facing a major deadline on Friday, February 14, for responding to move forward with Coinbase’s request to move forward with the appeal. The decision comes at a time when the SEC is undergoing a major shift under the new leadership with evolving regulatory strategies. As a result, this Friday’s response will set the tone for the agency’s future approach to crypto oversight. Here’s How the Regulator Would Respond Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terret has outlined four potential paths the US SEC could undertake in the Coinbase lawsuit. Here are the four potential cases for the securities regulator moving ahead: Oppose the Appeal : This would indicate the SEC’s continued stance, previously asserted by former Chair Gary Gensler, that securities laws clearly govern most crypto tokens. However, both Uyeda and Commissioner Hester Peirce have expressed concerns that the law in this area lacks clarity. Not Oppose the Appeal : A non-opposition would suggest the SEC is willing to address the broader issue of how securities laws apply to crypto, an area currently under review by the SEC’s crypto task force, as noted by Commissioner Peirce. Request an Extension : The SEC may seek more time to evaluate its position before responding to Coinbase’s request. Drop the Case : The agency could decide to discontinue the litigation altogether, effectively conceding the matter. Observers will be closely watching the situation moving ahead as the agency’s response will decide how they wish to tackle the securities laws moving ahead. SEC’s Crypto Task Force In Action The US SEC’s crypto task force has launched an official website to advance its mission of clarifying how securities laws apply to digital assets. The task force is focused on developing practical policy measures that promote innovation while ensuring investor protection. Having said that, the optimism has soared in the market with many speculating a potential pause in the Coinbase lawsuit ahead. To achieve its goals, the task force aims to collaborate closely with SEC staff and engage directly with the public. This initiative signals a shift toward a more inclusive and adaptive approach to cryptocurrency regulation, emphasizing transparency and innovation.

In a recent announcement , the crypto exchange OKX declared that it will be adding PI to its platform’s spot trading markets. Users can start depositing PI as early as Feb. 12 at 2:45 UTC. Spot trading will officially begin on Feb. 20 at 8:00 UTC, while withdrawals for PI will start on Feb. 21 at 8:00 UTC. The Pi Network is a platform that enables users to mine Pi coins using a mobile app. The project’s goal is to make cryptocurrency mining more accessible and reduce its environmental impact. It claims to be a “decentralized peer-to-peer ecosystem” which draws from a referral-driven growth model. According to the platform’s site , the Pi Network’s mainnet will officially launch on Feb. 20, 2025 at 8:00 UTC, transitioning into what it calls the “Open Network period of Mainnet.” “The Pi community is taking the enormous next step in achieving the Pi vision of the world’s most inclusive peer-to-peer ecosystem and online experience, fueled by Pi, the native token of Pi Network,” wrote the project. You might also like: Pi Network mainnet launch is coming: will Pi coin rise or fall? Even though the Pi Network’s mainnet has not been launched yet, some exchanges are already showcasing IoU prices for PI. An IoU crypto token serves as a debt lending token between two parties that is transferable through the same crypto exchange platform, similar to a traditional IoU document. Shortly after the OKX notice was published, the IoU price for PI surged to nearly 80% in the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinGecko. PI’s IoU price currently stands at $86. In the past week, the IoU price for the Pi Network token has skyrocketed by 112% in the past week. PI’s 24-hour trading volume sits at $770,718.

He describes the Pi Network as a “zero-cost mining project” it which allows users to mine crypto via a mobile phone without significant barriers. The user highlighted the risk regarding the Pi Network’s user referral mechanism, stating that the approach has the makings of a potential pyramid scheme. According to Pi Network’s official statement, users who wish to participate in Mainnet blockchain activities will need to complete a Know Your Customer verification process for individuals, and Know Your Business verification for businesses. “Overall, Pi intends to be a safe web3 space where Pioneers can have external connections with the Pi they hold,” said the protocol. However, @Asenup4 claimed that Chinese traders have faced difficulties in completing the KYC verification process due to limited slots or other systemic problems. Even if users begin the verification process now, they might not be approved in time for the token’s listing. As previously reported by crypto.news, the first grace period for KYC verification was delayed from Nov. 31 to Dec. 31. It was delayed a second time in December 2024 to Jan. 31, stating that millions of users had not migrated their tokens to the mainnet. Furthermore, @Asenup4 noted how the project has been in development for six years, which means a lot of its users migrated from Web2 to the Web3 ecosystem especially older users. “If you want to attract new OKXs [users], please act with caution. Don’t defraud the elderly of their private keys,” said the user. Read more: Pi Network developers issue a crucial mainnet launch update Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

The post references comments from Ripple CTO David Schwartz, who provided insight into McCaleb’s departure and the decisions that led to the creation of Stellar. David Schwartz’s Perspective on McCaleb’s Exit According to David Schwartz, Jed McCaleb had ideas that Ripple’s Board of Directors ultimately rejected. Unable to implement his vision within Ripple, McCaleb left to start Stellar based on those rejected ideas. One of Stellar’s early initiatives was a large-scale giveaway similar to what McCaleb proposed at Ripple. However, Schwartz described this giveaway as a failure and suggested Stellar eventually pivoted to become “a clone of Ripple.” Another key issue highlighted by Schwartz was McCaleb’s attempt to sell off his XRP holdings rapidly. Ripple intervened, preventing him from doing so through legal measures. Schwartz stated that if Ripple had not taken action, McCaleb might have sold his XRP at a much lower valuation, significantly reducing its worth. As a result of Ripple’s restrictions, McCaleb’s XRP holdings ended up being worth over $1 billion. Schwartz also criticized McCaleb’s approach to handling internal disagreements at Ripple. Rather than accepting the decisions of Ripple’s leadership and investors, McCaleb publicly criticized the company and started a direct competitor. Schwartz believes such actions are unethical. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Community Member Response and Schwartz’s Clarification In response to Schwartz’s comments, an X user named Dane pointed out that Schwartz explicitly stated that his remarks were not a reflection of Stellar’s current status or prospects. Dane argued that ignoring this aspect of Schwartz’s statement would take the message out of context. While Schwartz was critical of McCaleb’s actions, he made no claims about Stellar’s present value as a project. Schwartz himself later responded to Dane, stating , “100%. If you think what Jed did somehow renders Stellar/SDF evil or deserving of scorn, that argument almost equally applies to XRPL/Ripple.” This comment emphasized that McCaleb’s departure and actions should not necessarily be used to discredit the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) or the Stellar project itself. Schwartz appeared to acknowledge that Ripple and Stellar have their trajectories, independent of the events surrounding McCaleb’s exit. Schwartz’s remarks provide an important perspective on the internal conflicts that led to the creation of Stellar. His clarification further suggests that Stellar’s current status should not be judged solely on the circumstances of its founding. This discussion also highlights a broader issue within the cryptocurrency industry—disagreements among project founders can lead to separation and competition, sometimes at the expense of collaboration. However, as Ripple and Stellar continue to evolve, their roles in the digital asset ecosystem will ultimately be determined by their technological advancements and real-world utility rather than past disputes.

A report by CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost revealed that the Hash Ribbons metric, an indicator that tells the health of the Bitcoin network by tracking hash rate fluctuations, has just flashed again. This metric often shows face when miners are capitulating. Bitcoin Miners Are Capitulating Miner capitulation refers to a period when miners are unable to cover the costs of their operations and have to sell their BTC reserves or exit the market entirely. This often happens when the price of BTC declines, and less efficient miners are mostly affected because they do not earn enough bitcoins to cover their operational costs. Bitcoin miners usually keep some or all of the BTC they mine to be sold during bull markets for maximized returns, but they are forced to offload their holdings during capitulation. BTC was worth $96,700 at press time, down slightly in the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency has been changing hands under $100,000 over the last seven days, consolidating between the $91,000 and $102,000 price bands. This range-bound movement has made producing Bitcoin blocks less profitable for miners, hence the capitulation. Darkfost mentioned that the Hash Ribbons indicator has historically been a reliable signal, although the metric missed once during the COVID-19 market crash in 2020. It is also worth noting that the Hash Ribbons metric highlights optimal entry zones for investors looking to position themselves for mid-term and long-term price appreciation. Interestingly, a Bitcoin rally has followed each Hash Ribbon flash in the past. With Bitcoin miner capitulation often serving as a precursor to price bottoms in the past, it is safe to say that BTC may experience significant upside action soon. Bitcoin Hash Rate Surges The latest update in Bitcoin miner behavior comes as the network’s hash rate and mining difficulty hit all-time highs (ATH). CryptoPotato reported on February 10 that the Bitcoin hash rate hit an ATH of 845 million on February 8, while the mining difficulty spiked by 5.61% to 114.17 trillion during its last adjustment. Mining blocks on the Bitcoin network has become more difficult than a year ago; however, miners’ daily revenue is still low compared to last year.

40228034,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=128272,1739346220,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,An Interview With Avail,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/an-interview-with-avail/,"In an exclusive interview with BitcoinWorld , we got the chance to speak with Anurag Arjun , co-founder of Avail What is Avail, and what problems does it solve in the blockchain world? Avail is a modular data availability layer and a unified coordination layer for rollups. Think of it as a specialized blockchain that helps other blockchains scale more efficiently – we provide a secure way to store and verify transaction data for multiple blockchain networks. Today, in the L2 space, users are dealing with this incredibly fragmented experience. Their assets are spread across different L2s, and they have to navigate multiple bridges with different wrapped tokens, which introduces unnecessary complexity. We saw this problem emerging during my time at Polygon around 2020, when we were building scaling solutions and realized that without solid data availability at the base layer, you can’t build secure scaling solutions. To address this, Avail is creating a unification framework for Web3. At its core, it’s a modular application development stack that combines three key features – data availability, multi-asset shared security, and interoperability. When it comes to interoperability specifically, validity proofs and proof aggregation enable instant interactions, making the underlying chains invisible and the process frictionless. As unified infrastructure makes cross-chain interactions invisible, the question ‘which chain?’ becomes irrelevant for devs and users. Can you explain what a “data availability layer” is and why it’s important for scaling blockchains? Data availability layers like Avail have become integral as computation moves from Ethereum to Layer-2 rollups. When you move computation off-chain with rollups, you must be sure that all the transaction data is available and accessible to verify those computations. Without that guarantee, someone could theoretically submit invalid transactions, and no one would be able to prove they’re wrong. Many L2s depend on separate DA layers — rather than Ethereum’s built-in DA feature — to scale efficiently. However, these layers often rely on Data Availability Committees (DACs), which depend on a small group of ”trusted” nodes, introducing significant centralization risks. What makes our approach unique is that we use what’s called data availability sampling. Instead of forcing every node to download and verify all the data, which would be incredibly resource-intensive, users can verify data availability by sampling small random pieces. Think of it like quality control in a factory – you don’t need to check every single product to be confident about the overall quality. What makes Avail different from other blockchain infrastructure solutions? It is really about our fundamental approach to data availability. We have developed this system where users can verify data availability themselves. They only need to download small parts of the data but still get strong cryptographic guarantees that all the data exists. We use KZG cryptographic commitments, and users can sample against them, so you do not have to trust any operator to do their job correctly, unlike the aforementioned DAC method. If you look at the DA landscape, several players are trying to solve this problem, but we are all taking different approaches with different trade-offs. Our approach is different because we are validity-proof secured because of our KZG commitments. This means we do not need to rely on fraud proofs or wait through challenge periods. This is more robust because users can verify things themselves rather than relying on committees or long wait periods. We have also built this peer-to-peer overlay system. So even if something were to happen to the Avail chain, the data would still be available and verifiable through this network. Once data is published, it becomes difficult to censor. Additionally, as blockchains proliferate and enter the mainstream, interoperability between siloed networks has become the new holy grail. Avail offers a solution to rollup fragmentation through its three products: Avail DA, Nexus, and Fusion, which together aim to unify the web3 experience. Avail DA is a data availability layer we’ve discussed above; Avail Nexus is a custom ZK-coordination rollup built upon Avail DA to verify and aggregate proofs to facilitate asynchronous cross-rollup interoperability; and Avail Fusion is a shared security solution that will enable users to stake various native blue-chip tokens, along with native tokens of chains building on Avail, to increase economic security across the several layers of the Avail stack. Can you tell us about your recent partnership with Sophon? Sophon is the first-ever Validium built on Avail and recently hit the #3 Validium slot on L2 Beat just two weeks after launching. Sophon aims to be the leading platform for accessible and user-friendly blockchain products, catering to both seasoned users and newcomers. Built as a Validium on Avail, Sophon simplifies blockchain technology, allowing developers and consumers to enjoy its benefits without the common usability hurdles of today’s blockchain applications—such as the need to pay for each on-chain interaction individually. Our partnership with Sophon marks an essential milestone in our efforts to create better alignment between our communities. At the heart of this collaboration is what we call the “unified token initiative,” with the introduction of a new staking pool called stAVAIL, which opens up new opportunities for AVAIL token holders to earn multiple types of rewards through staking. How do Avail’s three components (DA, Nexus, and Fusion) work together? At its core, Avail is about connecting a fragmented ecosystem, streamlining the building process for developers, and enabling chain-agnostic user experiences that rollups, appchains, and dapps will need to go mass market. Avail DA is the first stage of our ecosystem – the base layer providing abundant block space for all the roll-ups and application-specific chains being built. Then we have Avail Nexus – which is interesting because it is a proof composition system built on top of our DA layer. The power here is that any roll-up can use it to seamlessly interact with other roll-ups. What makes this really powerful is that you don’t need to download all the transactional data – you can just take the validity proof and commitment to the data – and that’s enough. You are getting the full security guarantees while keeping things efficient. Avail Fusion is the third piece and it is about bringing external assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum into the Avail ecosystem to significantly improve security. Think of it as a way to leverage the security of established networks to make the entire ecosystem more robust. How does Avail’s approach to unifying rollups improve blockchain scalability and reduce costs? The current situation with roll-ups is that they are all operating in their own silos. When you want to move assets between roll-ups, you typically have to go back through L1, which is expensive and slow. What we are doing is fundamentally different. Because all these roll-ups can use Avail as their DA layer, they share the same security zone. This means one roll-up can verify what’s happening on another roll-up through a single validity proof – you don’t need complex bridge systems or long waiting periods. You are not just scaling individual roll-ups, you are making the entire ecosystem more efficient. What role do validators and light client operators play in Avail’s ecosystem, and how can people get involved? This is a crucial part of our design. We have built a system where validators are essential for network security, but we have also made it possible for regular users to verify data availability through light clients. You don’t need to run a full node – you can verify things even on a smart watch using our data availability sampling. We use a nominated proof of stake system and intend to support around 1000 validators asap – with room to grow to tens of thousands over time. We have carefully designed this to maintain decentralization while staying efficient. Anyone can get involved by either running a validator node or by using our light client network to verify data availability. Where do you see Avail’s technology making the biggest impact in the Web3 ecosystem in the next few years? The path we are on is really about unifying Web3. We currently have our mainnet running with nearly 50 modular chains and over 130 signed partners in testnet. But what excites me most is where this is heading; we are moving toward a future where users don’t have to think about which chain they are using. The most significant impact will come from how we are addressing fragmentation. When you combine our DA layer with Nexus and Fusion, you are creating an ecosystem where different blockchain solutions can work together seamlessly. We are betting that the future of blockchain is not about having one chain to rule them all but about having many specialized chains that can work together effectively. That’s where Avail comes in – we are building the infrastructure that makes this possible while maintaining the security and decentralization that makes blockchain technology valuable in the first place.

The total market cap now sits at $3.07 trillion, falling below the critical support level of $3.10 trillion. The Cryptocurrency Fear and Greed Index has also dropped, now at 35 indicating fear in the market. But what’s driving this market drop? Bitcoin ETF Outflow Continue One of the main factors contributing to the market’s decline is the continued outflow from Bitcoin ETFs. On February 10, Bitcoin ETFs saw an outflow of $186 million, with Fidelity, Grayscale, and Invesco leading the way. This trend continued on February 11, with an additional $56.7 million exiting Bitcoin ETFs, causing uncertainty in the market. Liquidations Add More Pressure Adding pressure to the ongoing market fall, liquidations have increased, especially among long traders. In the last 24 hours, $224 million worth of crypto positions were liquidated, including $174 million from long positions. The largest single liquidation took place on the Bybit exchange, where a BTC/USDT position worth $1.97 million was closed. This influx of liquidations has exacerbated the decline, as many traders are forced out of their positions. Altcoins Also Took The Heat It’s not just Bitcoin facing losses. Altcoins have been significantly affected, with the altcoin market losing a staggering $234 billion in just two weeks. Ethereum (ETH), XRP, and Solana (SOL) have seen drops between 5% and 8%, while meme coins like DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE have lost between 5% and 10%. The altcoin market’s struggles are making the broader market downturn even more pronounced. Bitcoin’s Struggle for Support Bitcoin, the largest and most influential cryptocurrency, has seen its price drop by more than 3%, now trading around $95,969 . The $90,000 level is proving to be a key support point. If Bitcoin fails to hold above this, it could slide further to $93,625. On the flip side, if Bitcoin regains its bullishness and moves above $103,000, it could find renewed bullish momentum.",News,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|ALTCOIN|TRADING|ETH,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-12 07:44:21

""2024 marked a historic milestone for the global and Indonesian crypto markets,"" said Timothius Martin, Chief Marketing Officer of PINTU. ""Our internal data from January 2024 to January 2025 reveals a massive increase in trading activity, with total trading volume up over 150% YoY and Monthly Trading Users (MTU) increasing by more than 100%. The most traded tokens on PINTU were AI tokens, which saw a trading volume surge of over 1,200%, followed by meme tokens, which recorded a 230% increase."" Globally, the crypto market capitalization rose by 97.7% in 2024, reaching $3.40 trillion by the end of the fourth quarter, according to CoinGecko's Annual Crypto Industry Report. This growth was mirrored by a 128.2% jump in average crypto trading volume, from $88.0 billion in Q3 2024 to $200.7 billion in Q4 2024. Factors driving this global surge included economic and political developments, particularly in the United States. The election of Donald Trump as the 47th President of the U.S. brought optimism to the industry, as he is expected to be more crypto-friendly than the former government. Trump’s administration appointed pro-crypto figures such as Elon Musk to key positions, and there were proposals to establish a U.S. strategic national Bitcoin reserve, further fueling the rise of crypto asset prices. The rise of AI tokens, with a 2,940% average Return on Investment (ROI) for the top 10, and meme tokens, boasting a 2,185% average ROI, dominated the 2024 crypto narrative. The AI sector growth was driven by innovations like ChatGPT and DeepSeek, as well as AI Agents—autonomous artificial intelligence systems capable of performing complex tasks efficiently. Meme token growth, driven by communities around projects like Dogecoin (DOGE), which surged 255%, and Popcat (POPCAT), which skyrocketed 9,954%, was closely linked to the Solana (SOL) ecosystem's expansion. Solana's network transactions increased by 152% in Q4 2024, exceeding Ethereum 's transaction volume. In Indonesia, crypto transactions surged 335.91% from 2023 to 2024, reaching a total value of IDR 650.61 trillion, according to Bappebti (Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency). Despite the optimistic outlook, Timo advised investors to remain cautious. ""While AI and meme tokens have experienced explosive growth, it’s critical to assess their underlying utility, innovation, and community strength. Crypto investments carry inherent risks, and investors must manage their portfolios wisely.""

Remittix , a cutting-edge global payments system, is taking the lead in addressing financial inclusion, one of the largest gaps in global finance, while XRP and HBAR continue their market wars. Let’s examine each of them separately, though: what is the status of XRP, how is HBAR positioned for 2025 and why Remittix may surpass them both in the years to come. Ripple’s Institutional Play: What’s Next for XRP Price? Lately, Ripple’s XRP has been in the news due to an astounding 9,640% rise in trading volume on Coinbase. In only one day, it reached an astounding $438 million. This type of action is not random; rather, it indicates heightened market speculation, institutional interest and strategic realignment around XRP. But the XRP price action remains volatile. Despite testing the $2.50 resistance, XRP hasn’t managed to hold its ground, currently hovering around $2.42. Analysts predict that if XRP price breaks the $2.62 barrier, a run toward $3 is likely. On the flip side, increased selling pressure could push it down toward $2.00 before another attempt at an uptrend. Hedera (HBAR): Building Momentum for 2025 Hedera’s price has fluctuated a lot; it just pulled down after a 47% comeback but it is still holding important support levels. Indicating a possible bullish breakout, the token has been trading close to significant Fibonacci retracement levels. HBAR’s structure suggests it’s in a corrective phase, setting up for another impulsive wave. Technical analysts are watching the $0.26 resistance level closely. If HBAR breaks above it, the next targets could be $0.31 and $0.39. However, failure to hold above $0.22 could see a deeper retracement. Despite the price fluctuations, the project itself continues to gain traction with its fast, low-cost transactions attracting attention from businesses and developers alike. Hedera’s focus on enterprise-grade blockchain solutions positions it well for long-term growth, but is that enough to compete with the massive opportunity Remittix is chasing? The Real Disruptor: How High Can Remittix Climb By 2027? While XRP and HBAR navigate market movements, Remittix is solving a much bigger problem : the broken global payments system. Right now, if someone in Nigeria, the Philippines, or El Salvador wants to send money abroad, they’re hit with high fees, slow processing times, and outdated banking systems that don’t work for them. But what if they could send crypto and have it instantly converted to FIAT, deposited directly into a bank account? That’s exactly what Remittix is making possible. Remittix allows for smooth transactions without the hassles of traditional banking thanks to support for more than 40 cryptocurrencies and more than 30 FIAT currencies. There are no hidden costs, dubious conversion rates, or waiting days for the money to clear. And the potential market is enormous. The global remittance industry moves over $183 trillion annually, yet people still rely on outdated services like Western Union, which charge 7% or more in fees. Daily SWIFT transactions exceed $5 trillion, if even a fraction of that volume shifts to Remittix, the upside is undeniable. Why Remittix Could Outperform Unlike platforms like Stripe, Wise or Coinbase, which still have barriers when it comes to converting crypto to FIAT, Remittix fully integrates both worlds. The presale numbers already speak for themselves: Over $11.6 million raised so far, with a 25x multiplier expected before the presale ends. After launch, projections indicate a potential 1,500% gain, making RTX one of the hottest investment opportunities in 2025. Beyond just investment hype, Remittix is removing obstacles that have prevented millions of people from accessing the global payments system by enabling them to cash out into FIAT without requiring a conventional bank account. XRP and HBAR Have Potential But Remittix is the Future Both HBAR and XRP have solid fundamentals and may experience price increases in the years to come. Institutions are investing in XRP and HBAR is surviving market corrections well. But neither of them is solving a real, immediate pain point like Remittix is. Remittix is positioned to be one of the most significant success stories of the upcoming years due to its enormous market to tap into, expanding ecosystem and strong presale momentum.

This comes after NYSE Arca applied on January 30, aiming to list and trade shares of Grayscale’s converted XRP Trust, similar to its Bitcoin and Ethereum Trusts. Terrett highlighted that the SEC typically acknowledges such filings within 15 days, and this acknowledgment could offer insights into how the current SEC leadership views XRP. This is especially significant because, under former SEC Chair gary gensler gary gensler Gary Gensler is a pioneer and the current chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. He has extensive experience that spans Wall Street, government regulation, and an angel teaching about cryptocurrencies and blockchain at MIT. Gary S. Gensler was on born October 18, 1957, in Baltimore, Maryland.He graduated from Pikesville High School in 1975, where he was later given a Distinguished Alumnus award. He also earned a degree in economics.Gensler served in the United States Department of the Treasury as Assistant Secretary for Financial Markets from 1997 to 1999, then as Undersecretary for Domestic Finance from 1999 to 2001He has expressed his desire to present crypto-related approach changes later on that include token commitments, decentralized finance, stablecoins, guardianship, exchange-traded resources, and advancing stages. Chairman XRP was considered an unregistered security—a stance challenged by a federal court ruling declaring that XRP is not a security . XRP’s Chances for an ETF in 2025 While the possibility of an XRP ETF is exciting, Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas estimate only a 65% chance of approval this year. This is notably lower compared to Litecoin (90%), Dogecoin (75%), and Solana (70%). The odds could improve dramatically if the SEC acknowledges Grayscale’s filing and resolves the ongoing Ripple lawsuit. Seyffart also noted that an XRP ETF approval is unlikely until the lawsuit concludes. There is norhing left in the lawsuit that, legally, would effect an ETF approval. All that's left are very specific sales by Ripple on exchanges. ""XRP.. is not a security"" and that's the most important thing vis a vis an ETF approval. — Jeremy Hogan (@attorneyjeremy1) February 11, 2025 .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Prediction For February 12 , Echoing a similar sentiment, Pro-lawyer Jeremy Hogan also said that XRP ETF approval is not possible before the Ripple vs. SEC cases are settled or dismissed. But he also acknowledged the fact that there is subjectively nothing left to argue and a closure is the only solution. This may create further regulatory troubles for XRP. According to him, the approval process takes 8-12 months due to the S-1 filing process. Meanwhile, Nasdaq has also requested SEC approval to list these ETFs, which let investors gain exposure to XRP without owning it. If approved, strong demand could boost XRP’s value. Moreover, XRP prospects are also rising since the SEC’s newly formed Crypto Task Force aims to clarify crypto regulations , which could impact ongoing cases. Recently, the SEC and Binance filed a joint motion to pause their lawsuit proceedings for 60 days, hinting that similar moves could occur in cases like Ripple’s. SEC’s delay could be a hint that they are waiting for Paul Atkins’s confirmation on the matter. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

As the sector evolves, participants need to adjust to a changing environment that integrates regulation, institutional involvement, and new market frameworks. CLS Global, a top global market maker, offers an in-depth analysis of these changes and their significant effects. Beyond Regulation: A Structural Evolution This transformation extends beyond standard regulatory changes—it is a fundamental reshaping of market microstructure. CLS Global recently reached a key milestone by settling regulatory matters with U.S. authorities, demonstrating its commitment to compliance. Through proactive engagement with the SEC and other agencies, the company has implemented enhanced measures and refined its operational scope to align with evolving regulations. At the heart of this shift is the increasing alignment between industry participants and regulators. As clearer frameworks emerge for digital asset trading, market players are stepping up, engaging with authorities, and proactively shaping sustainable operational models. The Rise of Hybrid Market Structures Centralized trading platforms are compelled to evolve by the reason of decentralized finance (DeFi) overtaking traditional financial markets. Liquidity providers are now functioning in a new hybrid framework, where centralized finance (CeFi) and DeFi are merging, to meet the increasing need for liquidity among various platforms. This situation offers distinct challenges and possibilities: Liquidity solutions of institutional quality are increasingly vital as conventional finance ventures into the cryptocurrency realm. Smart execution strategies are evolving to optimize order flow across both centralized and decentralized platforms. Risk management frameworks must adapt to a multi-venue trading environment. Institutional Players: The Real Market Movers While mainstream attention often focuses on price swings, the real story lies in how institutional players are reshaping market mechanics. CLS Global’s analysts highlight a key trend: traditional financial institutions are demanding trading infrastructure that mirrors conventional markets. From prime brokerage services to credit networks and advanced execution algorithms, institutional players are driving a more sophisticated market environment. For example, the recent surge in Bitcoin price beyond $106,000 is secondary to the underlying evolution in trading methodologies. Institutional traders increasingly leverage algorithmic execution and smart order routing across multiple exchanges, enhancing market efficiency. Bridging the Gap: Technical Challenges in Market Making Despite progress, technical hurdles remain. According to CLS Global’s CEO, Filipp V., “The industry’s next phase will be defined by how effectively we bridge the gap between traditional finance and decentralized systems. Market makers who can navigate both worlds while maintaining compliance will define the future of digital asset trading.” To succeed, market makers must rethink strategies, incorporating: Cross-venue inventory management to optimize asset distribution. Dynamic risk pricing across multiple blockchain networks. Integration of on-chain and off-chain liquidity sources for seamless trading. Real-time adaptation to settlement conditions in different trading environments. What’s Next for Crypto Market Structure? With the ongoing evolution of regulatory frameworks, the industry stands at the threshold of a fresh era in automated market-making. The future will involve greater dependence on hybrid models that integrate conventional and DeFi methods, improved settlement systems, and advanced cross-chain liquidity management. CLS Global continues to lead in these innovations, creating advanced trading strategies to handle the intricacies of the digital asset environment. Individuals who can effectively combine technical innovation with financial knowledge will be instrumental in defining the future of cryptocurrency trading. The development of the crypto market involves more than just compliance—it entails transformation. The upcoming years will demonstrate which individuals are prepared to take charge in this swiftly evolving environment.

Elliott Wave Says Yes,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-ready-for-2-43-rally-elliott-wave/,"A new chart shared by BigMike7335 (@Michael_EWpro) via X suggests that Dogecoin could be on the verge of a strong bullish wave targeting $2.43. His analysis relies on Elliott Wave theory, which divides market movements into impulsive drives and corrective phases. According to this view, DOGE’s historic rally from about $0.0020 to its previous peak near $0.68 unfolded in five distinct waves, labeled as Wave 5(A). This run tracked key Fibonacci extension levels, including the 2.618 region around $0.14591 and the 3.618 near $0.68835, confirming a robust impulsive phase. Wave C Could Take Dogecoin To $2.43 Once DOGE reached its high around $0.68, the chart shows a significant multi-month period of consolidation that the analyst interprets as a W–X–Y corrective move, comprising Wave (B). This aligns with Elliott’s concept that once an impulsive five-wave sequence is completed, the market is likely to enter a corrective structure which can form in many shapes, including flats, zigzags, or more complex “double” and “triple” patterns such as the W–X–Y indicated here. Throughout 2022 and well into 2023, Dogecoin’s price stayed in this corrective range, a phase that is also highlighted by the Ichimoku Cloud hovering above and around the price action. Traders often interpret the presence of the Ichimoku Cloud as a sign of sideways or uncertain momentum, which is exactly what a B-wave correction typically represents. Related Reading: Dogecoin Holding Strong—Analyst Says $4 Rally Could Be Next In November 2024, the Dogecoin broke above a descending trend line which capped price since the 2021 all-time high for more than 3.5 years. However, the momentum was lost in the following months. Since December, the chart reveals that Dogecoin has started to compress within a recognizable formation that could be viewed as a triangle or wedge. This shape is often seen in markets as price moves closer to a point of equilibrium before eventually breaking out. The “top TL” (top trendline), which had previously acted as resistance during the decline, is now being watched closely as a potential level for a support/resistance flip. Big Mike noted that DOGE “looks like we are going to retest the top TL for a s/r flip,” implying that a successful hold above this trendline could confirm the end of the (B) wave and the start of the next impulsive phase. Related Reading: Whales Accumulate 100 Million Dogecoin In 24 Hours – Demand Signals Growing Confidence In Elliott Wave terminology, if a five-wave impulsive move up is labeled (A) and the subsequent correction is labeled (B), then the next impulsive structure is typically labeled (C). In the shared chart, Big Mike projects that this Wave (C) could propel Dogecoin as high as $2.43, a figure that corresponds with another significant Fibonacci reference around $2.36 to $2.43. Traders and analysts often look to Fibonacci retracements and extensions to gauge potential support and resistance levels, and in Elliott Wave analysis, these ratios can help identify the possible end-points of larger waves. The chart also points to $0.15247 as a key level below current trading prices. If DOGE sees a pullback to this area, it could confirm that the retest of the descending trendline is underway. A bounce off this level might signal that Wave (C) is beginning, whereas a break below it could invalidate or postpone the bullish scenario. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.25.

This is as new activity is rising among its investors involving the addition of the new Panshibi meme coin to their portfolio. But during this same period, similar action was noticed among Internet Computer investors. Could there be something that these investors are seeing in this new presale meme token that others are not seeing yet? The Panshibi meme coin has been getting attention lately and it might also be worth checking out. Some analysts even predict that this new meme coin could be the next crypto to 100x. However, while these predictions and investors’ activities look optimistic, making the wrong move could be a problem. With the interest from Fantom and Internet Computer Investors, could this be a hidden gem that you should be buying right now as well? First, let’s see why the interest from Fantom and Internet Computer Investors might be a big deal. Are the ICP and Fantom Coin Losing Investors’ Trust already? In the last 8 weeks, the Internet Computer coin has seen a price drop of over 60% in a wave that looks like a continuous fall. While the Internet Computer claims to be introducing a next-level decentralized protocol for developers, the fall so far might suggest that it is not getting attention. Although the ICP was at a time one of the best defi coins, its recent drop has removed this title from the Internet Computer coin. Similarly, the latest rebrand from Fantom to Sonic has met a mixed signal from the market, showing a weak signal that it will become one of the best defi coins. This is following the Fantom crash before it went on its rebranding journey. Investors are still not very convinced about the Sonic coin, which many believe is a mere repainting of the old house. This bearish signal and low trust are causing a big sell-off in both Internet Computer and Sonic Coin right now. Hence, investors looking for the best defi coins to invest in are gradually moving away from these two. Is Panshibi the Next Crypto to 100x? The meme coin market looks like it might be starting another round of its bull run with the latest entry of Panshibi meme coin to the market. With a projection of over 145,000% after its official launch across exchanges, Panshibi is showing investors it is the meme coin to have right now. Its presale success and the bullish expert predictions it’s getting also suggest that this might be the best time for investors to win bigger in the meme coin. The Panshibi presale started a few weeks ago in what is to be a 60-day presale run, but it is already giving investors a hint of the bull run ahead. Investors in the Panshibi meme coin are set to see over 1200% simply by getting early to the party. This presale price surge is already set in motion, with price growth after every stage in the presale. Some analysts already believe this new meme coin is on its way to 50x in the first few days after it launches. This new meme coin is topping the list of the best meme coins with the potential to be 100x as it continues to win the attention of investors across the crypto market. The Internet computer and Fantom investors are betting on the Panshibi meme coin as the next crypto to 100x with its community-driven opportunities.

Pseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 315,900 followers on the social media platform X that looks bullish against the US dollar and Bitcoin ( BTC ). According to the trader, LTC appears to have completed an ABC corrective wave against the US dollar while flashing a bullish swing failure pattern (SFP) on its Bitcoin pair. Bluntz practices the Elliott Wave theory, which states that a bullish asset tends to witness a fresh five-wave rally after completing an ABC correction. Meanwhile, a bullish SFP is a reversal signal indicating that sellers tried to push the price of an asset down but strong demand pushed prices higher. Says Bluntz, “LTC of all things is trading like the market knows an ETF (exchange-traded fund) is imminent, very strong against USD pair and a weekly SFP on the BTC pair. I haven’t seen something that looks as clearly bullish as this in a while.” Source: Bluntz/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that Litecoin will shatter resistance at $147, retest it as support and rally to $180 – a level last seen during the 2021 bull market. Bluntz is not the only trader who is bullish on Litecoin. In December, veteran trader Peter Brandt told his 777,300 followers on the social media platform X that Litecoin “has the potential to become another powerful chart” after LTC surged above $100. At time of writing, Litecoin is trading for $119.60.

The Solana price has fluctuated between $214.90 and $284, only to fall back to $202, leading many investors to reconsider their strategy and seek more promising alternatives.

With its weekly gains of 36% and monthly gains of 81%, Michael Saylor has gone out praising the firm for religiously implementing their Bitcoin strategy. Michael Saylor Backs Metaplanet Microstrategy executive Chairman Michael Saylor praised the recent Metaplanet stock movement which has witnessed a parabolic rally from under ¥1000 in October 2024, to now at more than ¥6,650. Over the last month itself, the stock price has appreciated by a staggering 81%, while its one-year returns stand at a massive 4,000%. In a message on the X platform, Michael Saylor asked his followers to check the developments at the Japanese firm. You should probably follow @Metaplanet_JP . pic.twitter.com/HgDZ7tt0Rr — Michael Saylor (@saylor) February 12, 2025 Metaplanet has stormed the Japanese stock market and the Nikkei over the past few months. The Metaplanet stock ended today’s session 13% higher and as Japan’s 19th most liquid stock, catching Michael Saylor’s eye. The firm’s Bitcoin strategist Dylan LeClair noted that the company recorded a trading volume of ¥42.6 billion (approximately $277 million), underscoring its growing influence in the Japanese financial markets. Source: Dyland LeClair Furthermore, company CEO Simon Gerovich has taken a dig at JPMorgan for shorting the Metaplanet stock. Following this mega rally, Gerovich wrote : “My heartfelt condolences to Morgan Stanley for their short position in Metaplanet. However, it appears he still has a short position of over 1 million shares”. Four Billion Yen Bitcoin Purchase Plan Michael Saylor’s comment comes after Metaplanet announced the issuance of its sixth unsecured corporate bond, raising ¥4 billion at a 0% interest rate earlier this week. The bond, issued without collateral or guarantees, reflects the company’s strong credit profile and financial stability. This funding allows Metaplanet to immediately acquire Bitcoin, bypassing the waiting period associated with exercising stock acquisition rights, thereby accelerating its Bitcoin Treasury strategy. In a statement, the company emphasized its commitment to leveraging capital markets to enhance its treasury and deliver greater value to shareholders. Two weeks back, Metaplanet also announced plans to purchase 21,000 Bitcoins in total by the end of 2026. Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy Continues BTC Accumulation Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy has also continued with its Bitcoin purchases. Earlier on Monday, MicroStrategy announced buying 7,633 BTC for an investment value of $742 million, taking its total Bitcoin holdings to 478,740 BTC. As of press time, the Bitcoin price is trading 2% down at $96,226 with a market cap of $1.90 trillion. The daily trading volume has surged by 8.7% to $37 billion, with the 24-hour liquidations soaring to $43 million, of which the long liquidations are alone more than $37 million. This recent dip has sparked speculations despite the BTC accumulation trend by the institutions. However, it appears that the ongoing macroeconomic concerns and the upcoming US CPI inflation data have forced the investors to stay on the sideline.

The motion cites the formation of the SEC’s new Crypto Task Force as a significant factor that could influence the resolution of the case. This decision has sparked discussions within the cryptocurrency community, with commentators speculating its broader implications. Notably, Ashley Prosper shared the news on social media, suggesting that this move could indicate that the Ripple case may be nearing its conclusion. In response, Zach Rector reacted enthusiastically, stating , “SEC vibe check! Looks like the war on crypto is over! XRP about to fly!” SEC vibe check! Looks like the war on crypto is over! XRP about to fly! https://t.co/VHBUEux7Aq — Zach Rector (@ZachRector7) February 11, 2025 Details of the Joint Motion The SEC and Binance’s request for a stay is based on legal precedent allowing courts to pause proceedings when it serves the interest of judicial efficiency and does not unduly harm any party. The motion references Clinton v. Jones (1997), which affirms a court’s discretion to control its docket. The key reasons cited for the stay include: Lack of harm to either party – Since the motion is jointly filed, neither side is contesting the pause. Judicial efficiency – If the Crypto Task Force’s efforts lead to regulatory clarity, it could facilitate a settlement or alternative resolution, potentially avoiding prolonged litigation. Avoiding unnecessary proceedings – If an early resolution is reached, the court may not need to rule on Binance’s pending motions to dismiss the amended complaint. The SEC’s Crypto Task Force was announced on January 21, 2025, under Acting Chairman Mark T. Uyeda, focusing on establishing a regulatory framework for digital assets. The outcome of this initiative could have a substantial impact on multiple ongoing crypto-related cases. Speculation on Broader Implications Ashley Prosper’s interpretation suggests that if the SEC is reconsidering its approach in the Binance case, similar developments could occur in the lawsuit against Ripple. The SEC’s case against Ripple has been a focal point for the industry, with XRP holders closely monitoring any regulatory shifts. Zach Rector’s reaction further underscores the optimism in the XRP community . His statement, “Looks like the war on crypto is over! XRP about to fly!” reflects a belief that the SEC may be shifting away from its historically aggressive stance on digital assets. While no direct link has been established between the Binance motion and the Ripple case, the timing raises questions about whether broader regulatory changes could influence XRP’s legal status and market performance. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Potential Outcomes The 60-day stay could bring several key developments. If the Crypto Task Force establishes favorable guidelines, companies like Binance and Ripple may benefit from clearer compliance pathways. A potential settlement between the SEC and Binance could also set a precedent for how the agency handles other crypto-related cases. Additionally, speculation around regulatory shifts often affects asset prices, meaning positive news could drive XRP’s valuation higher. While it remains to be seen how this stay will impact the broader crypto landscape, the SEC’s willingness to pause litigation suggests that regulatory attitudes may evolve. If the Crypto Task Force leads to meaningful policy changes, it could alter the trajectory of enforcement actions against digital asset firms. This development offers a reason for cautious optimism for XRP holders and the wider cryptocurrency community. However, as with any regulatory matter, concrete outcomes depend on the SEC’s next steps. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Powell also voiced support for stablecoin regulation while opposing anti-crypto debanking efforts, signaling a more favorable stance toward digital assets. Powell reaffirmed the Fed’s cautious approach, saying aggressive interest rate cuts are unnecessary. Last year, a 50 basis-point rate cut boosted the crypto market, but Powell has since slowed the pace. While some investors hope for larger cuts to encourage capital inflows, drastic reductions could create uncertainty and push investors toward safer assets. His decision to maintain the status quo may lead institutional investors to wait for clearer policy signals before making significant moves into crypto. Reflecting this cautious sentiment, Bitcoin ETFs saw their first weekly net outflow of 2025. Beyond interest rates, Powell addressed the need for clear regulations around stablecoins. He emphasized their potential for both consumers and businesses but stressed the importance of a strong regulatory framework to ensure financial stability and consumer protection. The European Union recently adopted stablecoin regulations, increasing pressure on U.S. lawmakers to do the same. Powell fully supports these efforts, stating that stablecoins should develop within a regulated environment that safeguards users. Additionally, Powell took a stand against ongoing efforts to limit crypto banking access. He acknowledged growing concerns about ""debanking"" and pledged to examine the issue more closely. Congress is currently investigating Operation Choke Point 2.0, and the FDIC has released a large collection of documents related to the matter. Powell appears convinced by the findings and has committed to using his influence at the Fed to prevent further restrictions on crypto-related banking services. Overall, Powell’s statements suggest a more measured approach to monetary policy and a willingness to support clearer crypto regulations. His stance could shape the financial landscape in the coming months, influencing both investor sentiment and the broader regulatory environment for digital assets.",,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION|BTC|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-12 09:13:50

The market operator solidified its reputation as a key partner in fighting digital crime. The European exchange increased its involvement with digital crime prevention. In 2024, WhiteBIT intercepted $150M in funds at risk, acquired through hacks and exploits. For the whole of 2024, crypto crime took $2.2B globally, a 21.07% increase from the previous year. Chainalysis noted a total of 303 hacking incidents, up from 282 for the preceding period. Attempts to launder funds through exchanges is seen as one of the risk factors for more transparent and regulated crypto adoption. Out of the frozen funds under investigation, WhiteBIT safeguarded $4.8M from high-profile cases involving stolen crypto assets. Centralized exchanges are more willing to freeze funds when suspecting illegal activities, including previous address contamination with mixers or other predetermined criteria. WhiteBIT also prepared its platform for increased government regulations for crypto. The exchange aims to secure official licenses and remain a staple for European and Central Asian users. WhiteBIT secured multiple high-profile hacks WhiteBIT partnered in securing funds tied to XRP in an investigation involving Ripple’s co-founder Chris Larsen. The market operator also assisted with the Coinspaid attack, by securing the funds and starting the recovery process. WhiteBIT also followed the tracks of the TAO Holder case, identified by on-chain investigator ZachXBT. The exchange blocked a large sum of USDC, while cooperating with law enforcement. In one case, WhiteBIT managed to intercept and return funds linked to an exploit by the North Korean hacking group Lazarus. The hack of the Rain.com exchange took away $16M, of which $760,000 in stolen SOL were tracked to WhiteBIT. In September, WhiteBIT managed to return the funds under custody of the FBI, taking another step into the recovery process. WhiteBIT steps up AML practices WhiteBIT remains open to communication and compliance with law enforcement, whenever a threat or stolen funds are discovered. The exchange aims to set itself apart from markets that deliberately avoid AML practices and serve as an off-ramp for hackers. “Our approach goes beyond standard AML practices,” said a representative from WhiteBIT’s Compliance department. “We leverage OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) to uncover suspicious activities meticulously, utilize custom-built monitoring systems to detect and halt fraudulent transactions, and conduct manual investigations to ensure detailed and accurate assessments of flagged cases.” WhiteBIT warned users on some of the most common types of scams, mixing both technical and social attack vectors. More than 40% of hacking attempts include technical means, including phishing, malware, keyloggers, and direct account hacking. Another 40% of scams include disguised attempts to gain access to a wallet for seemingly legitimate purposes. Some of the scams include Telegram-based earnings promises, where users initially make small investments, but eventually deposits are not paid back. WhiteBIT has also encountered attempts to scam users with copycat sites and account login pages. Compromised accounts without 2FA also increase the risk of losses. The exchange protects user funds by storing 96% of deposits in cold wallets, enforcing 2FA and securing private keys with additional passwords. WhiteBIT has been certified for penetration testing, user security and bug bounty, leading to its high score from CER. The WhiteBIT exchange achieved CCSS Level 3 certification with Hacken, covering the highest security standard for the crypto industry. The market operator aims to remain at the forefront of crypto security, with both passive and active engagement with threats. The recent bull cycle increased the raw number of attacks, while also unleashing more sophisticated vectors. WhiteBIT aims to remain a benchmark for safety under those changing conditions.

The BTC price surged above the much-awaited milestone at $100K and hit the ATH above $109K, but altcoins stayed behind. Other than some, like Solana, BinanceCoin, and some newly launched tokens, no cryptos maintained a steep ascending trend. Moreover, the data from Glassnode suggests the altcoins have largely decoupled from the BTC price rally after the market cap decreased by more than $234 billion in the past fortnight. The memecoins have squeezed out most of the liquidity as the top altcoins struggle to grab some. On the other hand, the altcoin market dominance has been declining since the start of 2024 and tested June 2023 lows and the lowest point in the past 4 years. A similar thing happened during the last cycle, but the decline was quicker and more severe. Source: X The big move up in altcoin dominance did not happen until 2021, which was the post-halving year, much similar to the current trend. By then, BTC had traded up 50% to 100% from its previous all-time high and continued to head higher from there. Meanwhile, the current market dynamics appear to be much more diverse than before, as the altcoins, till now, have been performing worse compared to the previous cycle. Will Altseason be Delayed to 2026? Total market capitalization, excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum, is trying to heal its wounds after a week of record liquidation. While the range holds above $850 billion, which makes it an important range to hold, the market capitalization including Ethereum appears to be more weaker. Hence, the altcoins do not seem to be stronger as they have not yet demonstrated massive recovery. Regardless of this, a popular analyst, Moustache , does not believe that the Altseason is cancelled as the levels continue to consolidate above the pivotal support. The total market capitalization excluding BTC is staying strong above the trend line, which has turned into a strong support. After breaking above the descending broadening wedge, the levels are correcting and hence a rebound seems to be inevitable. Moreover, the analyst believes the upcoming altseason could be more monstrous than that of 2014-1028.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ETH,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-12 09:15:29

The success of meme coins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and others have demonstrated how community-driven projects can experience explosive growth. But with the popularity of meme coins growing, so has the challenge of identifying the next one that will see massive gains. If you missed out on investing in Dogs Coin when it peaked, now is the time to get in on the next big meme coin: BTFD Coin. Much like the meteoric rise of Dogs Coin, BTFD Coin is quickly gaining traction with its powerful presale momentum, strong community engagement, and innovative features like its Referral Program. For those who missed out on Dogs Coin’s explosive growth, BTFD Coin offers a second chance to secure significant gains with one of the top meme coin presales to buy today. BTFD Coin – The Rising Star with a Referral Program That Rewards You BTFD Coin is making waves with its impressive presale performance and the unique features it offers to its community. One of the standout elements of BTFD Coin is its Referral Program, which allows investors to earn BTFD tokens simply by referring others to the presale. This incentivizes users to share the coin with friends and family, growing the community organically and driving demand. Here’s how the referral program works: once you connect your wallet to the buy page, you’ll receive a unique referral code. Anyone who uses your code to buy BTFD tokens gets an additional 10% in tokens on their purchase if they invest at least $50. As the referrer, you also receive 10% of the amount your referrals invest, but only if you make it into the top 20 referrers for the month. This makes the referral program a dynamic way to earn additional tokens and grow your portfolio. The presale is in its 14th stage, and with BTFD Coin priced at just $0.00016, early investors have the opportunity to buy millions of tokens at a low price. If the price rises to its predicted value of $0.006 post-launch, those who buy in now could see gains of up to 3,500%. This makes BTFD Coin one of the top meme coin presales to buy today, and investors who act now have the chance to secure massive returns before the price explodes. With its innovative referral system, strong community, and multiple ways to earn, BTFD Coin is not just another meme coin. It’s a well-rounded project designed for long-term success, making it the perfect opportunity for those looking for a second chance after missing out on Dogs Coin. Dogs Coin – A Missed Opportunity That Can Teach Valuable Lessons Dogs Coin, a dog-themed meme coin, quickly became one of the most talked-about tokens when it surged in price, making early investors significant profits. The meme coin’s viral nature drove its price to unprecedented heights, creating overnight millionaires. However, for many who hesitated or waited too long, the opportunity to cash in on those gains has passed. Despite its success, the hype surrounding Dogs Coin has begun to settle, and its price has somewhat cooled down from its peak. New investors who didn’t act quickly enough now find themselves looking for the next big meme coin. If you missed the chance to buy Dogs Coin when it hit its high, the opportunity is not lost. BTFD Coin is here to fill the gap, and it’s showing all the signs of being the next meme coin to explode in value. Unlike Dogs Coin, which relied heavily on meme appeal, BTFD Coin is focusing on sustainability and community involvement, making it one of the top meme coin presales to buy today. The presale performance has been stellar, and with over $6 million raised, 69 billion coins sold, and more than 10,500 holders already, the momentum is undeniable. If you missed out on Dogs Coin, BTFD Coin offers another chance for those seeking big gains in the meme coin market. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Your Chance with BTFD Coin If you missed the explosive growth of Dogs Coin, now is your second chance to make a move with BTFD Coin. With an exciting referral program, the potential for 100x returns, and an active, growing community, BTFD Coin is quickly becoming one of the top meme coin presales to buy today. Early investors who act now stand to gain significantly as the presale progresses and the coin approaches its public launch. Just like Dogs Coin created millionaires during its rise, BTFD Coin has the potential to do the same. But the key is to act quickly—once the presale ends and BTFD Coin goes public, it might be too late to secure these low prices. Don’t miss your opportunity to be part of the next big meme coin success story.

Analysts Evaluate!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/how-will-inflation-data-to-be-announced-today-affect-bitcoin-and-fed-analysts-evaluate/,"Today, the critical inflation data that the FED attaches importance to in making interest rate decisions will be announced. The FED held interest rates steady in January and paused interest rate cuts in September, November and December. In this situation, while the expectation of an interest rate cut extends to June, the CPI data to be announced today is of critical importance. At this point, while January CPI data in the US is expected to show limited progress in inflation, a below-expected CPI data is expected to be positive for risky assets, including Bitcoin (BTC). This is because lower-than-expected data, especially core inflation, will support expectations for further rate cuts, which could lead to lower Treasury yields and a weaker dollar index. It could also increase demand for riskier assets like Bitcoin. However, analysts say that investors expecting a big bull run will be disappointed, and even if there is a rise, it will be limited. Analysts said that a possible change in interest rate cuts could send BTC higher, but it would not be enough to break out of the ongoing consolidation between $90,000 and $110,000. What are the CPI Expectations? Analysts at BlackRock and RBC Capital said they did not expect the CPI data to prompt the Fed to cut interest rates. According to Coindesk, RBC analysts predict that concerns about the trade war that Donald Trump initiated with his tariff move will increase inflation and cause the FED to approach interest rate cuts more cautiously. “We do not expect the progress in inflation to be sufficient to prompt the Fed to cut interest rates further this year. We expect the January report to show a limited easing of price pressures.” BlackRock analysts also said that even if the CPI comes in below expectations, the Fed is unlikely to cut interest rates. BlackRock analysts said that continued inflation, especially in the services sector, would prevent the Fed from lowering interest rates. “January US CPI data is due today. Even as the December CPI report shows signs of easing inflation pressures, our view is that wage growth remains above the level that would allow inflation to pull back to the Fed's 2% target. We see persistent services inflation forcing the Fed to keep rates high for longer.” What Does Jerome Powell Think? FED Chairman Jerome Powell stated in his speech at the Senate Banking Committee hearing yesterday that low unemployment and inflation remain above the FED's 2% target. Powell said the Fed is in no rush to cut interest rates again, given the generally strong economy. *This is not investment advice.

(FDIC) are addressing a dispute over the asset manager’s stakes in American banks. The negotiations , which have been ongoing for months, revolve around BlackRock’s compliance with new oversight rules that require asset managers to maintain a “passive” role in the banks they invest in. FDIC demands BlackRock sign a passivity agreement FDIC demands BlackRock to sign a passivity agreement to comply with new oversight of its stakes. According to the FDIC, such agreements are crucial in ensuring investors remain passive and do not exercise control over banking institutions when they have large stakes. BlackRock was initially given a February 10th deadline to comply, but this deadline had already been extended twice. This has pushed the disagreement into the Trump administration. Some key members have already departed the board. Those members were at the forefront of arguing for more stringent rules on asset managers. Jonathan McKernan, a Republican, and Rohit Chopra, a Democrat, were leading the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. While the two are on opposite sides of the political aisle, both supported increased oversight of large asset managers, saying their size and concentrated ownership could give firms undue influence over the management and strategy of US banks. For now, there’s no new deadline for the firm to comply with the FDIC’s demands. Still, with the exit of these directors, the regulatory environment regarding BlackRock’s bank holdings could change in the coming weeks. FDIC seeks transparency from asset managers The FDIC seeks more transparency regarding asset managers’ stakes in FDIC-supervised banks. This should prove that they’re operating as passive shareholders rather than activists. The FDIC has also sought to scrutinize stakes in FDIC-supervised banks that exceed 10%. However, BlackRock has resisted the FDIC’s demands, arguing that new oversight measures could disrupt index funds, which dominate many investor portfolios, and make it more costly for banks to raise capital. It also has said the regulator should coordinate any new oversight with the Federal Reserve, which has a passivity agreement with the firm. While a new deadline has not been set, sources close to the negotiations suggest that an agreement between BlackRock and the FDIC may be reached soon. This regulatory standoff comes at a time when the financial sector is undergoing significant shifts, including increased integration of digital assets. The thinking within crypto circles is that this one step is part of a directional shift that will ultimately encourage more banking giants to deal with digital assets. Such a shift would bring wider acceptance of the industry. Yesterday, the Crypto Council for Innovation led discussions on the future of digital asset regulation in the US, titled “A Golden Age of Digital Assets : Charting a Path Forward”. The hearing explored existing crypto and blockchain use cases. It also examined current uses of crypto and blockchain technology and how the Biden administration has affected the ecosystem. Discussions also focused on the legislative measures needed to protect consumers and fully realize cryptocurrency’s potential in the United States. The influence of crypto on traditional banking and asset management could lead regulators to increase oversight of crypto firms and major financial players such as BlackRock. The results of BlackRock and FDIC negotiations will establish a precedent for how regulators navigate the expanding relationship between institutional finance and emerging finance.

According to Bloomberg, a document sent from the White House to Capitol Hill on Feb. 12 revealed Trump’s intention to position Quintenz at the helm of the CFTC. If confirmed, Quintenz’s appointment could significantly reshape the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies, potentially positioning the CFTC as the primary watchdog for the industry over the more enforcement-heavy Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Alongside Quintenz, the document also named Jonathan Gould, a partner at the global law firm Jones Day, as Trump’s choice for Comptroller of the Currency, the agency overseeing U.S. national banks. Additionally, Jonathan McKernan, who recently stepped down from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), has been tapped as the new permanent head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Quintenz’s Track Record in Crypto Regulation Quintenz is no stranger to the CFTC. He previously served as a commissioner under the first Trump administration from 2016 to 2020, where he strongly supported the integration of digital asset derivatives and cryptocurrency products into the federal regulatory framework. His stance on crypto-friendly policies has remained unwavering. In March, he openly criticized SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s approach to Ethereum’s legal classification, accusing the agency of regulatory inconsistency. He pointed out that the SEC had previously classified Ethereum as a non-security when it approved Ether futures ETFs in October 2023. “If the SEC had any doubt about ETH’s regulatory treatment, it wouldn’t have approved the ETF,” Quintenz argued, further stating that treating ETH as a security would make CFTC-listed futures contracts “illegal.” A16z’s Influence Quintenz’s current role as head of policy at Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) underscores his deep involvement in the crypto sector. A16z is one of the largest venture capital firms in the industry, backing major blockchain projects like Solana, Avalanche, Aptos, EigenLayer, Lido, OpenSea, and Coinbase. Following the crypto regulatory shakeup anticipated under a new Trump administration, a16z has expressed optimism about a more flexible environment for blockchain innovation. If Quintenz secures the CFTC chair position, the U.S. could witness a shift toward a more balanced and industry-friendly approach to crypto regulation.

40231563,https://nulltx.com/?p=144608,1739353097,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,President of the Central African Republic Accused of Scamming Traders Through $CAR Token Launch,https://nulltx.com/president-of-the-central-african-republic-accused-of-scamming-traders-through-car-token-launch/,"In an unexpected turn of events, blockchain researchers have charged the President of the Central African Republic (CAR) , Faustin-Archange Touadéra, with running a scam to bilk investors through the launch of the $CAR memecoin. What initially seemed like a legitimate cryptocurrency project has rapidly collapsed into a shambolic wreck, with investors now nursing considerable monetary wounds as a result. The situation has thrown into sharp relief just how little regulatory oversight there is in the world of cryptocurrencies and how easy it is for even well-known political figures to endorse dubious projects. The Rise and Fall of the $CAR Token After an official announcement from President Touadéra, the $CAR memecoin was launched and immediately drew attention. The project gained traction quickly, largely because of the endorsement from the President himself. In just minutes, the market cap of the token shot up from about $580K to an incredible $400 million, and within three hours, that cap had surged to $800 million. Even though the growth we are seeing is impressive, experts are already noticing strange patterns in the tokenomics of the $CAR project. According to blockchain researchers, over 95% of the total supply of the $CAR token was locked away. So, if you believe in the $CAR project and in its future, you have to believe that these tokens, which are mostly sitting there and not doing anything, are somehow going to be part of a healthy ecosystem. If you’re a seasoned trader, though, and you’ve already seen through to the other side of the shiny facade, I guess you could imagine a scenario in which this healthy ecosystem isn’t in play and some of these locked tokens are just waiting around to be used for a bit of not-so-legal price action. The matter became even more unclear with the initiation of a web page for the $CAR token. It was first put forth as a genuine outlet for investor information but turned out to be just as useful and real as the $CAR token. Concurrently, a “real” site was linked. This website was under construction at the time of link and immediately proceeded to have credibility issues. Compounding the problem, the official Twitter account for $CAR was suspended, which added to the mounting suspicion that something shady was going on. The account is still suspended, and the team claims they are working to get the account back online, but there has been no communication with the public since the account was suspended. This has led many to believe that Twitter’s actions were part of an effort to stop what was looking more and more like a scam from happening on their platform. A Massive Dump and Investor Losses The $CAR token was initially very exciting. It shot up in price and then promptly dropped, leaving investors who had jumped on the excitement in an uncomfortable position. In some ways, that makes $CAR like other pump-and-dump schemes. But because $CAR was at least somewhat linked to an actual product that has value, it may represent a new kind of cryptocurrency ne’er-do-well: one with real use cases that nonetheless is not offering real value. And it is seriously affecting $CAR holders. This situation has a part that is particularly worrisome. On-chain evidence connects President Touadéra and his team directly to the bulk of the token’s profits. Blockchain data indicates that the largest wallets controlling $CAR tokens are directly related to the President and his close associates. Those same wallets are believed to have already realized something like $40 million in profits coming directly from unsuspecting investors who’ve bought the token. And the same wallets are still holding another $70 million+ worth of tokens that they’re going to sell at some point. Even more damning evidence emerged from the investigation. The personal digital wallet of President Touadéra, known by the blockchain address DeB4XcwEGdMDfA3nQ2NNfvASzmZA5qHWba7xMkrYaQ9H, reveals that he bought $CAR tokens before the official announcement for just $1,999. When the token launched, he was not holding it for long. He sold off his holdings right away for an enormous profit of $1.7 million. In the interim, he was busy dumping 150 to 250 Solana (SOL) tokens every minute. So his actions were not just illegal; they were causing $CAR to crash. Meet Faustin Touadéra, the first President-crypto scammer He dumped $CAR by 94% and vanished over $110M in 20 hours My research shows African politicians are planning mass rug pulls : How African leaders are ROBBING you and how to fight back pic.twitter.com/ObOsgpKjH5 — Leviathan (@TechLeviathan) February 10, 2025 Even with the substantial evidence of market manipulation, President Touadéra has stuck with calling the launch a “massive success.” In his most recent public statement, he thanked those who had supported the token and reiterated his bullishness about the project’s future. However, these comments are hard to reconcile with the reality of the 99% of investors who have lost a significant amount of money. His assertions also seem to be an effort to quiet the rumor that his account was hacked at the time of the launch. Given the massive amount of evidence suggesting that intentional market manipulation took place, it seems very hard to believe that this was the case. Instead, the whole situation looks like a scam that was pulled off very well, indeed, and that left a whole lot of investors in bad shape after supposedly “going legit.” A Wake-Up Call for the Crypto Market The $CAR problem serves as a clear and sharp warning about the dangers of putting money into cryptocurrencies. These digital assets have a lot of potential but, as with any great opportunity, they also carry a great risk. That risk has been heightened in recent months by the number of bad actors in the space, and by the almost perfect environment they have for pulling off their scams. The situation with $CAR, a digital currency backed by the Central African Republic, reminds us that even the rarebsure bets in the crypto space can go terribly wrong. The $CAR launch fallout is now under examination by both blockchain researchers and regulators. The incident may push the whole cryptocurrency market into increased scrutiny. If the event does lead to tighter regulations and/or a more aware investor base, it’s clear the $CAR token launch will have lasting effects on how digital assets are treated in the future.

The attack took aim at a weakness in the Uniswap V3 mechanism, particularly its ability to allow users to create liquidity pools and set prices in advance. The assailant exploited the oversight in a series of well-planned steps that resulted in significant financial damage to the project. How the Attack Unfolded The method of attack relied on a flaw in the Four_Meme contract’s handling of liquidity and token prices. The project’s tokens were initially bought by the attacker at a very low price. They were purchased before liquidity was added to PancakeSwap, a decentralized exchange where our tokens trade. This gave the attacker two advantages. First, they got our tokens at a price that was ridiculously low. Second, had they held onto those tokens, they would have likely netted a much higher price after liquidity got added to the decentralized exchange. In the next step, the attack moved on to creating, in a preemptive way, a trading pair pool on PancakeSwap. The attacker took the low-price tokens and paired them with WBNB (Wrapped Binance Coin). Yet there was one important detail in this step: the price of the token was set at an extraordinarily high rate. This price manipulation was not an oversight. It was a calculated move that took advantage of the way Uniswap V3 allows for the creation of liquidity pools at predetermined prices. Once they had set up the costly trading pair, the attacker bided their time and let the project in question launch. When the liquidity was injected into the PancakeSwap pool, the attacker struck. Using a bot, they added more liquidity to the pool, but at a much higher price, thus pushing the price of the token higher, and we do mean much higher. The last part of the step was when the attacker disposed of the tokens they had acquired at the low price, now at the inflated price they had set earlier. They sold off the tokens and profited substantially from the difference between the low acquisition price and the inflated sale price. Exploiting the Uniswap V3 Mechanism This attack was directed at the Uniswap V3 protocol and how it operates. Uniswap V3 provides a nifty feature that allows liquidity providers (LPs) to specify custom price ranges for the pools they’re providing liquidity to. This is good and well, as it allows LPs to concentrate their capital in the price ranges that are most conducive to their business. However, this feature also allows an LP with bad intentions (like our friend “0x8aa”) to create a price range that’s super conducive to hoodwinking token buyers and sellers—to create a setup that allows them to peg a token price at some artificial range, for instance. In this instance, the mechanism was fully exploited by the attacker, who set up a not-so-simple scenario that artfully created a token price that was totally inflated. The price was artificially pumped up—via a setup that was not quite as simple as it seemed—before any of the project’s liquidity was made available. By the time the actual liquidity was added and the price “settled,” the attackers had already made off with profits amounting to 100 percent of the artificially boosted price of the token. This attack type is especially worrisome for projects and investors, revealing design and implementation weaknesses in liquidity pools on decentralized exchanges such as PancakeSwap. These platforms may allow for decentralized trading opportunities, but they also present new risks, especially when the protocols that underlie them fail to mitigate the possibility of price manipulation. Current Status of the Stolen Funds Currently, the stolen assets are situated in the address connected to the attacker: 0x482b004e7800174a1eFb87f496552ac8F53B2fda. This indicates that the assets that were taken have not yet been relocated or sold off and that the Four_Meme team has not made clear whether it will take any steps to get back the stolen money. The incident underscores the urgent necessity for improved security and vigilance. With decentralized finance (DeFi) ascending to a more visible position within the industry, this event serves as a potent reminder of what can occur when we allow our defenses to lapse. The DeFi space welcomes new projects on what seems like a daily basis. With this influx of newcomers—many of which are inarguably not as well understood and tested as the pioneers of yesteryear—comes an increased opportunity for bad actors. @four_meme_ suffered an attack, resulting in a loss of approximately $183K. The core issue of the attack is the failure to account for Uniswap V3's mechanism, which allows for the creation of a liquidity pool and price setting in advance. pic.twitter.com/RXmeO4h0og — Beosin Alert (@BeosinAlert) February 11, 2025 A Wake-Up Call for the DeFi Community The Four_Meme attack is not an isolated incident but part of a larger trend in which decentralized protocols are being targeted for financial gain. As DeFi platforms achieve greater traction, they have become enticing targets for malicious actors who are looking to exploit any vulnerability, whether that be a smart contract, liquidity pool setup, or price setting mechanism. The Four_Meme team could take the recent attack on their project’s smart contract as a wake-up call to rethink not just their management of liquidity pools but also, and more importantly, their security protocols in general. If the smart contract for a project can be hacked, then the project itself can be said to have a security hole as large as the one in the National Security Agency’s Fort Meade, Maryland, headquarters that was famously penetrated by a couple of high school kids in 1999. The DeFi space keeps evolving, and projects and investors alike need to be on their toes regarding the potential system vulnerabilities. The Four_Meme attack serves as a costly reminder that a single misstep in managing liquidity and price settings can yield significant losses. This incident also underscores that, in the fast-moving world of cryptocurrency, security must always be front of mind and never an afterthought. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The altcoins have suffered even more, as usual, by marking substantial declines over the past day of up to 8% in the case of SUI. BTC Stopped at $98K The primary cryptocurrency endured a highly volatile start to the previous business week by charting a few $10K moves that sent its price on a real rollercoaster following Trump’s tariffs against China, Mexico, and Canada. The asset calmed in the following days and even tried to reclaim the $100,000 level on Friday but was quickly halted in its tracks. The rejections drove it south to $96,000, which is where it spent most of the weekend. The bulls tried to take the upper hand on Monday and Tuesday and pushed bitcoin to a multi-day peak of just over $98,000. However, the overall bearish sentiment prevailed, and BTC couldn’t breach that level for long. Just the opposite, it started to lose value and dropped to $95,000 later on. As of now, it has added around $1,000 and sits at $96,000, but more volatility is expected later when the US CPI numbers for January are set to be released . Its market capitalization has declined to $1.910 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts has returned to 58.5%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts Back in Red As it typically happens during similar crashes, the altcoins have it even worse. The biggest daily losers from the larger-cap alts are SUI (-8%), HBAR (-8%), AVAX (-7%), XLM (-6%), LINK (-5.5%), and DOGE (-5%). Ethereum, Ripple, Cardano, and Solana are also in the red, but in a slightly less painful manner. In contrast, ENA, TIA, and KAS have plunged by double-digits from the mid-cap alts. The cumulative market cap of all crypto assets has seen over $80 billion gone in a day and is well below $3.3 trillion on CG now. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

This Best New Meme Coin to Join Now is Your Prime Ticket to 2025’s Crypto Fortune!,https://thecoinrise.com/didnt-catch-pudgy-penguins-early-this-best-new-meme-coin-to-join-now-is-your-prime-ticket-to-2025s-crypto-fortune/,"It’s the same old story—another investor watches a meme coin moon and kicks themselves for missing out. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) was one of those sleeper hits. It started as a niche NFT project and skyrocketed into a thriving brand that saw jaw-dropping growth. But if you weren’t in on it early, the life-changing gains were out of reach. Now, Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is rolling into the scene with an explosive presale, and this might be the chance to ride a new wave before it takes off. Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just another meme coin. It’s an adventure-packed, blockchain-powered community ecosystem with a presale already raising over $1.1 million. Investors are rushing in as APC enters its 10th presale stage—Aqua Frost—at just $0.000059 per token. With a final listing price of $0.008, early adopters stand to see an insane 13,451.72% ROI. Those who missed Pudgy Penguins at its floor price may not want to let this best new meme coin to join now slip by. Arctic Pablo Coin (APC): The Next Meme Coin Phenomenon Taking Off Right Now The crypto market moves fast, and Arctic Pablo Coin is one of the best new meme coins to join now. Investors are stacking their APC bags before the price climbs any further. Unlike other meme coins, this one carries a full-fledged storyline, NFT integration, and staking rewards up to 66% APY. One of the biggest reasons Arctic Pablo Coin is making waves is its deflationary supply model. Unsold tokens from each presale stage get permanently burned, reducing overall circulation and increasing scarcity. This structure primes APC for massive upside as demand rises. Right now, it’s at its Aqua Frost stage, meaning investors who buy in at $0.000059 per APC could see their holdings balloon when the token lists at $0.008. For perspective, let’s talk numbers. A $3,000 investment at this stage would grab you over 50.8 million APC tokens. At the listing price, that stash would be worth approximately $406,000. It’s no wonder investors are scrambling to get in before the presale ends. Beyond its explosive presale, Arctic Pablo Coin’s staking system offers a lucrative way to earn passive income. With a 66% APY, early investors can multiply their holdings before the token even hits exchanges. Plus, a referral program incentivizes users to spread the word, creating organic momentum that many meme coins lack. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU): The Wealth You Missed—Will You Let It Happen Again? Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) started as an NFT collection in 2021, with prices hovering around 0.03 ETH ($60 at the time). Those who grabbed a Pudgy early watched in awe as the project took off, with some NFTs selling for over $200,000. The brand went beyond crypto, making headlines with toy deals and mainstream collaborations. The floor price today? Way higher than it was at launch. Investors who overlooked Pudgy Penguins as just another NFT collection missed one of the biggest breakout projects in the meme space. The same thing could happen now with Arctic Pablo Coin. Meme coins are no longer just jokes—they’re cultural phenomena driving real financial gains. With APC’s presale numbers climbing fast, the question is whether you want to be on the right side of history this time. Unlike the NFTs of PENGU, which require big capital for big rewards, Arctic Pablo Coin lets investors jump in with as little as a few dollars. The potential returns, though? Astronomical. Will Arctic Pablo Coin Be the Next Meme Coin to Dominate? The meme coin market thrives on hype, but Arctic Pablo Coin has something more: a fully structured ecosystem, a deflationary supply model, and staking rewards that keep the community engaged. Unlike many projects that fizzle out after launch, APC is setting itself up for sustained growth, and that why standing tall as the best new meme coin to join now. Its unique theme—blending adventure with blockchain innovation—makes it more than just a speculative token. It’s an ecosystem of discovery, NFTs, and staking rewards designed to keep users engaged. With Binance Smart Chain’s low fees and fast transactions, Arctic Pablo Coin is set up to dominate meme coin trading on DEXs and centralized exchanges alike. The Final Thoughts Meme coins are evolving from internet jokes to full-fledged investment opportunities, and Arctic Pablo Coin is proving that once again shining as the best new meme coin to join now . Pudgy Penguins taught the crypto world that early adoption is key, but only for those who were paying attention. Now, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale is flying through its final stages, and investors who hesitate may miss out on another life-changing opportunity. The choice is simple: wait and watch Arctic Pablo Coin explode, or secure your stake while the presale price still offers generational wealth potential. Sign up now before the final stages of the presale close, and get in before the listing price makes these early prices a distant memory. For More Information: Arctic Pablo Coin: https://www.arcticpablo.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/ArcticPabloOfficial Twitter: https://x.com/arcticpabloHQ Frequently Asked Questions 1. What is Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) and why is it gaining traction? Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is a meme coin built on the Binance Smart Chain with staking rewards, a referral program, and a deflationary supply model. It has already raised over $1.1 million in its presale and offers a potential 13,451.72% ROI from its Aqua Frost stage to the listing price. 2. How does Arctic Pablo Coin compare to Pudgy Penguins (PENGU)? Pudgy Penguins saw massive gains for early investors, but many missed the initial boom. Arctic Pablo Coin is in its early stages, meaning investors have a chance to get in before its major price surge upon exchange listings. 3. How much can I earn if I invest in Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale? At the current presale price of $0.000059 per APC, a $3,000 investment would get over 50.8 million tokens.

40231836,https://nulltx.com/?p=144606,1739353676,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Grayscale Files for Cardano ETF: A Significant Step for Crypto Investment,https://nulltx.com/grayscale-files-for-cardano-etf-a-significant-step-for-crypto-investment/,"For cryptocurrency investment products, Grayscale is a leading asset manager. It has filed for a Cardano exchange-traded fund—an ETF. This happened on February 10, 2023. The proposed fund is intended to allow investors to gain exposure to the ADA token. It would do so in a “regulated, traditional financial environment.” If and when the ETF is approved, it would make Grayscale, again, the first to do something significant in this crypto space—the first to issue a “spot” ETF for Cardano. Key Details of the Filing Grayscale’s proposal would create a way to invest in Cardano through a public security rather than through a crypto-exchange or in private transactions. As the most recent effort from the firm’s high-profile CEO, Michael Sonnenshein, in conjunction with the SEC, it may lack the teeth needed to bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream. Grayscale appears poised to bring the ADA token much closer to investors, much in the same vein as other firms have brought bitcoin and ether. In the proposed structure, it would be Coinbase Custody Trust Company holding the ADA assets, ensuring the safety of the digital asset. The operational support, along with the impeccable command of regulatory compliance, would fall under the auspices of BNY Mellon Asset Servicing. This is Grayscale’s current gig for its crypto trusts, which have been hitting it out of the park for several years now. Why? Because they’re providing an institutional-grade path for investing in digital assets. When it comes to the evolution of cryptocurrency investments, Grayscale’s recent filing represents quite an achievement for the firm. The filing adds another major coin to the list and gives Grayscale’s ETF application for Cardano quite a serious aspect to it. Grayscale isn’t just some fringe player. It’s a well-respected name in the digital currency space. Their ETF application isn’t going to get ignored or laughed out of the room. And interest in Cardano isn’t going to diminish anytime soon. If anything, it’s on the increase as the crypto space’s interest in the coin deepens. A Historic Moment for Cardano and Crypto ETFs Should Grayscale’s Cardano ETF win the approval of regulators, it would send a historic wave through both the generally cryptocurrency space and the far more specific sphere of Cardano. Currently, Cardano stands as one of the few smart contract platforms that anoints anything approaching a reasonable amount of investment in its projects. Futures contracts and ETFs are the regulated, near-to-no-risk means of investment that hedge funds love. Should Grayscale’s ETF be approved, the most exciting part of it—again, for both the Cardano project and its associated cryptocurrency—would be that ADA as an asset would now be accessible to those investors. Getting the Cardano ETF approved would place it on par with Grayscale’s other significant assets. The company offers ETFs for two of the largest digital currencies by market cap: Bitcoin and Ethereum. Interest in Grayscale’s crypto ETFs is growing, especially from the company’s institutional investor base, which seems to be favoring the Grayscale model for secure, regulated access to the crypto markets. If the Grayscale Cardano ETF follows the lead of its two big siblings, it could soon become a go-to vehicle for those interested in accessing whatever upside might come from ADA’s burgeoning DeFi potential. Potential Challenges and SEC Scrutiny There are obstacles to overcome before Grayscale Cardano ETF can become a reality. The biggest challenge facing Grayscale Cardano ETF’s approval may be the SEC’s previous stance on ADA. In 2023, the SEC called ADA a security in the lawsuits it brought against Binance and Coinbase. Those lawsuits, and the public statements the SEC makes in them, could delay or complicate the approval of the Grayscale ETF. After all, the SEC has closely scrutinized many different cryptocurrencies over the years, and its position on ADA looks like it could become a substantial and significant hurdle for Grayscale Cardano ETF. Even with all these regulatory obstacles, Grayscale keeps hope alive. The latest thing from Grayscale is a request to the SEC to allow them to turn their Cardano trust into a directly investable ETF. They filed this request in the wake of ETPs becoming available in Europe, with Virtune AB launching one for Cardano on February 6. If international markets are amenable to Cardano ETF-like investment vehicles, why not the U.S.? Looking Ahead The Cardano ETF proposal filed by Grayscale signals something exhilarating for the crypto-investing world, especially for those who want to invest in ADA and have been waiting for a more regulated way to do so. Again, the SEC is evaluating the proposal. Whatever response it offers will give us some much-needed clarity on the matter of crypto ETFs in general. If the Grayscale Cardano ETF gets approved, it will make for an effective gateway drug to future well-regulated funds that offer investors exposure to crypto. At present, the SEC is the focus of everyone’s attention as it examines the submission. Should an affirmative result emerge, it would most likely ignite the all-too-frequent fires of controversy that seem to accompany the intersection of traditional finance and the decentralized digital currency world. Indeed, the Grayscale Cardano ETF could become a new touchstone for these often-contentious debates. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

40232007,https://nulltx.com/?p=144605,1739354021,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Bitcoin Supply Squeeze Intensifies: Institutional Demand Surges as Whales Move Massive Amounts,https://nulltx.com/bitcoin-supply-squeeze-intensifies-institutional-demand-surges-as-whales-move-massive-amounts/,"The principal shift we are seeing in the Bitcoin market today is that demand is outpacing supply. Not just any demand—interest from Wall Street. Institutional investors have been dipping their toes into Bitcoin for the past year, and in 2021, it feels like they are taking the plunge. Large purchases from high-net-worth individuals and organizations are also squeezing Bitcoin supply on the market. While “whale” activity—large-scale trading—has always been part of the Bitcoin market, it’s now more pronounced, and with it, our old friend the Bitcoin supply squeeze. Institutional Purchases and Whale Activity Fueling Supply Crunch In the last few days, the buying of big amounts of Bitcoin has sensationally decreased its already low available supply. MicroStrategy, under the Bitcoin-believing leadership of Michael Saylor, is plowing ahead with its aggressive Bitcoin grab. On February 10, the company purchased a stunning 7,633 BTC, worth around $742 million. This acquisition adds to MicroStrategy’s already significant Bitcoin stash, making it one of the largest, if not the largest, corporate holders of Bitcoin worldwide. The $BTC supply squeeze is getting real! • Saylor isn’t stopping—MicroStrategy just stacked 7,633 BTC ($742M). • Metaplanet has joined the game—raising ¥4B to load up on Bitcoin. • Demand is crushing supply—ETFs have grabbed 55,896 BTC in 2025, while only 16,200 BTC were… — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) February 11, 2025 But it’s not just MicroStrategy piling on Bitcoin. A venture capital firm, Metaplanet, has just raised ¥4 billion (roughly $30 million) to boost its own Bitcoin reserve. Institutions of this sort are starting to pay attention. Metaplanet and its ilk are not your average retail investors. As this kind of outfit starts to hedge with Bitcoin, and with an overall supply of Bitcoin that is fixed and, in fact, decreasing, that Bitcoin price is pumping should come as no surprise. As Bitcoin ETFs have intensified their buying, the mismatch between demand and supply has become stark. In 2025, the ETFs acquired a stunning 55,896 BTC. However, only a mere 16,200 BTC was mined during that same timeframe. This stark contrast showcases the institutional interest in Bitcoin and attempts to highlight the trend of that interest graphically. Bitcoin ETFs have been a significant tool to try to display that interest in the open market. They have been buying an enormous amount of Bitcoin and, in contrast, there has been minimal mining. Whale Activity and Rising Premiums Point to Higher Demand Bitcoin’s supply keeps getting pressurized. The Coinbase Premium Index, our nearest proxy for institutional demand, has flipped positive in the past week. When the Premium Index is positive, it means institutions are buying up Bitcoin and are willing to pay a premium for it. This has historically been quite a reliable leading indicator for Bitcoin price action. So is this a good sign for the price of Bitcoin? Cointelegraph asked Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder and CEO of Alameda Research and FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange. Besides institutional buying, another force at work pushing the supply of Bitcoin in the opposite direction is whale activity. Over the last week, for example, whales—those large Bitcoin investors—have moved more than 60,000 BTC. When such influential players shift or reallocate their holdings, it’s indicative not just of potential imminent price moves (in either direction) but also of further reducing the amount of Bitcoin that retail and institutional investors can get their hands on. With the tightening supply of Bitcoin, we might expect the price to climb. Some analysts even think we could see a really big surge hit us soon. The big number to look at is $101,000. If we go through that, there are over $3 billion worth of short positions that could get liquidated, with the potential of triggering a massive rally. And if the bottom side of that scenario were to play out, it would get us buying in a cascade as we force ourselves to close our short positions. Once $BTC clears $101K, over $3 billion in shorts are getting wiped out. The clock is ticking… Which side are you on? pic.twitter.com/BblYtfnZH4 — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) February 11, 2025 ETF Outflows and Inflows: Mixed Signals Even with the rising demand and a constricting supply, Bitcoin ETFs have undergone some changes in recent days. On February 10, Bitcoin spot ETFs saw a net outflow of $186 million; this might seem like a setback, but it’s crucial to note that BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, saw a single-day net inflow of $55.36 million. So, while it appears as though the Bitcoin spot ETF is being drained, in reality, the very opposite is occurring with one of its closest affiliates. Without making any claims regarding why that is, it’s very interesting to note the considerable interest in Bitcoin at the institutional level, especially among the likes of BlackRock. The demand for Bitcoin appears to be gaining even more momentum. We see this coming not just from the buying activity of high-net-worth individuals and family offices (which, by the way, seems to be on the upswing), but also from both institutional and retail ETF investors. This suggests to us that the Bitcoin market is becoming more and more, for lack of a better term, “adult.” Looking Ahead: What’s Next for Bitcoin? In the next few weeks, Bitcoin’s price movement could be affected critically. Demand from institutions that want to hold Bitcoin keeps rising, but the supply seems stuck. If institutional demand were to move the price above $101,000, I think that would make it clear—especially to retail investors—that a price breakout has occurred. Since the situation has become so volatile, I think it prudent for all Bitcoin investors to closely watch the forgoing factors. Vigilandtenders, you’ll want to keep an eye on the trajectory of Bitcoin over the next month or so. In total, the Bitcoin supply squeeze is getting seriously real. When we look at all the huge players that are accumulating, we are left with a market that could really surprise us at any moment with some huge price movements. Sure, there might be some moments in the next few months where it looks like we are facing a return to the kind of volatility that took us down to $40,000 back in June. But, in general, and as a whole, it seems to me that the Bitcoin accumulation and now supply squeeze story is an exciting one. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Several recent events have occurred that may signal a change in investor behavior around Ethereum—one that could shift the asset’s long-term price trajectory in a positive direction, though, as we will see, this is not at all a guarantee. These events include: increasing “whale” activity; a historic shift in Ethereum from centralized exchanges to decentralized means of exchange; and increased illiquidity for Ethereum as an asset. Growing Whale Activity and Shrinking Exchange Reserves One of the most reliable signs of investor confidence in Ethereum is the recent uptick in whale activity. Since February 1, the ranks of Ethereum whales holding 10,000 ETH or more have swelled by 2.30%. This rise in whale numbers points to an accumulation trend, as high-net-worth individuals or institutions continue to scoop up impressive amounts of ETH. Such activity is the very definition of a long-term bullish outlook. These investors are betting on sustained Ethereum growth, no matter how many price dips or reversals the network might endure in the short term. The number of #Ethereum whales holding over 10,000 $ETH has risen by 2.30% since February 1, signaling growing accumulation! pic.twitter.com/Mc09dY5XaW — Ali (@ali_charts) February 11, 2025 Along with this increase in whale holdings, Ethereum achieved a historic moment between February 8 and 9 and saw around 224,410 ETH moved off exchanges in just 24 hours. This occasion marks the largest net withdrawal from exchanges in the last 23 months. When large sums of cryptocurrency are withdrawn from exchanges, it usually means that investors aren’t looking to sell any time soon. Instead, they’re content to hold their assets and often have a long-term view of the investment. There was a historic milestone of ~224,410 ETH moving away from exchanges in the 24 hours between February 8th and 9th. This was the most amount of net coins moving off of known exchange wallets in a single day in 23 months. Though more of a long-term metric, this is a… pic.twitter.com/G2e2AausPh — Santiment (@santimentfeed) February 11, 2025 The large-scale outflow of Ethereum from exchanges decreases the supply of Ethers available for trading. This makes the chance of a near-future, substantial selloff, where a large number of Ethers are sold at once, less likely. For the price of Ethereum, this is a good thing. A fewer number of coins available to be sold on the open market means the price is under less downward pressure than it otherwise might be. Long-Term Confidence Despite Short-Term Struggles Although Ethereum’s movement away from exchanges shows a growing confidence in the cryptocurrency, it does not change the fact that Bitcoin will play a huge role in Ethereum’s price actions in 2025. Bitcoin is still the larger and more influential cryptocurrency. It leads the market in terms of moves either up or down. If it starts moving up, then generally most of the other coins in the market will follow; if it starts crashing down, then again, most of the other coins will also follow with it down. So, can Bitcoin stabilize and head back up toward its all-time high? In the past few months, Bitcoin has encountered numerous obstacles to meeting the demands of the associated institutional and retail investors who closely monitor its volatility and signs of market correction. Should Bitcoin mount an effective counteroffensive and push its price back up, then Ethereum stands to gain significantly, pulling in prospective investors as it looks to Ripple past the $2 Mark. However, if Bitcoin maintains its current trend and, in fact, digresses further, then Ethereum’s ecosystem indicators probably won’t impact its price appreciably. Ethereum’s ETF Activity and Market Outflows Along with the movements of whales and diminishing exchange reserves, the Ethereum spot ETF has experienced some wild swings in recent weeks. On February 10, the total net outflow from the Ethereum spot ETF was $22.46 million. While this does represent a one-day record number of outflows, we must keep in mind that not all flows out of an ETF mean “get ready for the rocket down.” In fact, not long before this, we had a hefty inflow of $9.18 million on February 8. Nonetheless, the spot ETF seems to be having a tough time of it, and the market seems to have decided that it doesn’t want to hold way too much in Ethereum for the short term. Still, the increasing presence of Ethereum whales and the significant pullback of ETH from exchanges suggest that long-term believers in the asset abound. On February 10, Bitcoin spot ETFs had a total net outflow of $186 million. BlackRock ETF IBIT had a single-day net inflow of $55.3647 million. The Ethereum spot ETF had a total net outflow of $22.4573 million. https://t.co/59u0BnEqLG — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) February 11, 2025 That so many investors are pulling their ETH back from exchanges and are apparently holding it for the long term is, in my book, a much more Ethereum-positive indicator than the price going up. If this trend continues, and with EIP-1559 and ETH 2.0 in our future, it could lead to a supply situation that makes major sell-offs much less likely and the price much more stable. The Road Ahead for Ethereum Ethereum’s present market conduct indicates a shift in investor sentiment toward the positive. An increasing number of whale investors are accumulating ETH, and a historic amount of ETH is leaving exchanges. These factors unambiguously suggest a growing long-term confidence in ETH, even as its price struggles in the short term. The key to ETH’s overcoming what appears to be a most recent accumulation of downside price pressure lies in the performance of BTC. If BTC can perform, and perform meaningfully, over the next few months, we should expect ETH to follow suit and also perform. The next few months will be critical for the price direction of Ethereum. If the coin can keep on accumulating and keep its coins off exchanges, it might be set up for a price rebound, with or without the latest boost to Bitcoin’s price. The broader market still carries a lot of uncertainty, though, and a price rebound that stays rebounding for Ethereum will probably require at least some in-market stability as it threatens to break free of market-wide trends weighed down by other altcoins. These developments hold promise for Ethereum investors. Whale activity is up, and so are exchange withdrawals. That paints a hopeful picture at the moment—maybe enough hope for Ether investors to push the price back in the direction of the sun and away from the increasingly bearish storm clouds that had been hovering over it.

Solana (SOL) Solana (SOL) has seen significant price changes recently. In the past week, the price decreased by 5.59%. Over the past month, it increased by 8.76%, and over the last six months, it grew by 42.08%. This indicates a short-term decline but strong long-term growth. The current price ranges between $177.92 and $221.63. The nearest resistance level is $242.68. If the price moves above this, the next resistance is at $286.39. On the downside, the nearest support level is $155.26. Falling below this could lead to testing the second support at $111.55. Technical indicators show mixed signals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 54.56, suggesting the market is neutral. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $203.72, slightly above the 100-day average of $199.28. The MACD level is positive at 0.6728, and the stochastic value is 76.08. These figures hint at potential for further growth, but market movements remain uncertain. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum’s price has seen recent fluctuations. Over the past week, it dropped by 5.93%. The past month showed a decline of 17.33%. However, looking at the last six months, there’s a slight increase of 1.78%. The current price ranges between $2219 and $2980. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $2705.15, while the 100-day average is $2656.99. The Relative Strength Index stands at 59.90. This suggests the market is nearing overbought conditions. The Stochastic indicator is at 83.60, indicating potential for a price reversal. Ethereum’s nearest resistance level is $3331. Breaking above this could target the second resistance at $4092. On the downside, the nearest support is at $1809.75. Falling below this might lead to the second support at $1049.04. These levels suggest possible movements of around 20% from current prices. Conclusion Though Ethereum and Solana are set for gains, XYZVerse (XYZ) emerges as a pioneering memecoin aiming for 20,000% growth by uniting sports fans globally.

Experts are drawing parallels between a promising altcoin and early Ethereum and Cardano, suggesting a potential 6x increase in value soon. Table of Contents Intel Markets soars 811% in ongoing crypto ICO event Crypto Caesar: Ethereum could soar to $6,400 ADA price may see a big move soon, analyst predicts Conclusion Experts are drawn to one particular altcoin as the market prepares for the upcoming bull run: Intel Markets (INTL). Much like the early days of Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA), this coin is expected to stand out due to its smart technology and strong adoption potential. Intel Markets aims to capitalize on the growth of the AI market, which Statista predicts will be worth $826b by 2030. Some experts even predict that this altcoin, now in phase nine of its presale, could soar by 6x before 2025 ends. Meanwhile, the Ethereum and Cardano price movements have been showing red, which makes many traders cautious. Intel Markets soars 811% in ongoing crypto ICO event While Ethereum and Cardano are among the top 10 altcoins, Intel Markets is also making headlines right now. This is all thanks to its great crypto ICO event performance. Notably, Intel Markets has rewarded early buyers with an 811% return so far. With over 27m INTL tokens already sold, it is clear interest in this project is sky-high. The hype for Intel Markets is strong, thanks to the solutions it aims to bring to crypto trading. Intel Markets will launch the very first AI-powered smart trading platform. On it, traders will get to experience self-learning trading robots that improve their performance. Up to 1000x leverage on capital will also help traders access liquidity of up to $100k with just a $100 investment. Therefore, Intel Markets could become the best trading platform for countless traders. Those interested in this project are now buying its native token, INTL. Currently, this altcoin costs just $0.082, an 811% rise from its starting price of $0.009. However, INTL could soar to $0.091 after phase ten begins. Furthermore, everyone is waiting for a Tier-1 CEX to list INTL. This may lead to a potential price pump to $0.11. You might also like: 50x altcoin rally incoming: Intel Markets could repeat SOL’s 2021 chart pattern Crypto Caesar: Ethereum could soar to $6,400 Ethereum is one of the best cryptos, but its value has been dropping. CoinMarketCap shows that the price of Ethereum fell from around $3,300 to nearly $2,600 on the one-month chart. In other words, this altcoin experienced nearly a 20% drop in just a few short weeks. However, market expert Crypto Caesar has made a bullish Ethereum price prediction. In a recent X post, he said that this crypto coin is undervalued now. He predicts that the price of Ethereum could soar to $6,400 soon. Although this statement has raised interest in Ethereum, traders are still sidestepping it. Given that its market cap now sits at $320b, the price of Ethereum may not move as fast, as a lot of new money needs to come in. ADA price may see a big move soon, analyst predicts Cardano is another altcoin that has been facing some turbulence. In the past 30 days, the Cardano price sank nearly 25% as per CoinMarketCap. During that time, its value moved from over $0.90 to below $0.70. The community is still watching Cardano thanks to some bullish statements from analysts like Sssebi. According to his recent X post, the Cardano price could soar to $2.5 in February or March. This Cardano price prediction has turned some heads, but many investors are still cautious. Since the Cardano price has surged over 30% on the YTD chart, its highest upswings may have passed. Conclusion Ethereum and Cardano could see price rebounds soon. Experts think Intel Markets has what it takes to replicate their growth. This project will introduce technology that will also allow it to enter the AI market. This altcoin will have a smaller market cap, which means faster price growth with less money needed. For these reasons, experts think INTL could be the next ETH or ADA, with a potential 6x price surge before 2025 ends.

WazirX recently announced a compensation plan directed toward users affected by the hack. As a matter of fact, this hack, which resulted in the loss of an eye-popping $235 million (USD) in digital assets, not only shocked users of WazirX but also rocked and reverberated through the Indian crypto community at large. Adding several twists and turns to this already crazy saga, WazirX recently surfaced with a compensation plan and has promised to reimburse users to the tune of 85% of the USD values of their portfolios that they held on the day of the breach (July 18, 2024). The Rebalanced Portfolio Scheme The rebalanced portfolio scheme that WazirX has launched is now live for users who were affected by the hack to recover some of their lost funds. Under the scheme, users will receive about 85% back of the value of their portfolio, calculated based on the USD value of the assets at the time of the hack. In addition, users will receive 20% of the actual current market value of their holdings. The attack ultimately rebalanced WazirX’s own portfolio in a way that had the company’s users not holding Bitcoin or Ethereum would certainly have preferred. The new scheme structured to ensure users got back a reasonable portion of their lost funds was a clear as day statement that the crypto exchange’s financial health post-breach was anything but robust. In fact, it indicated that WazirX must have taken a serious hit to its solvency because the amount users were able to recover under the new scheme (as of now) isn’t even close to being a full reimbursement of their identified losses. The Development of the Decentralized Exchange (DEX) A central component of the compensation plan concerns the creation of WazirX’s new decentralized exchange (DEX). Reports say that the company plans to construct this exchange using the very funds that were originally earmarked to compensate users. This is, in effect, a win-win for WazirX: Building the DEX for what is essentially a no-cost outlay will make the long-term operation of the exchange (and thus the platform) more feasible. Compensating users with funds that do not have to be repaid from WazirX’s operating budget allows the company to keep solvent while working through its hack-related financial troubles. The decentralized exchange will give users more control over their funds and offer more security in light of the breach. A DEX runs on a decentralized network, so it poses far fewer risks than a centralized exchange. Yet WazirX still isn’t out of the woods; its team dubbed the incident a “WazirX hack,” and it could take up to 11 weeks for an internal audit to determine how much cash and crypto the platform lost. On the upside, the team promises that it will roll out a revenue-sharing model in which WazirX’s DEX profits go back to users over the next three years. Still, while the initiative aims to benefit the affected users, the structure of the compensation plan appears to be somewhat more favorable to WazirX’s leadership team. They are expected to receive a kind of profit sharing for as long as the DEX is operational. Unlike the plan for compensating affected users, this part of the structure seems to be set up as a long-term revenue stream for the platform’s executives. Rebalancing Complete! The rebalancing of platform assets is now done! Initial Fund distribution will return ~85.25% of USD value to creditors, based on rebalancing prices. Creditors can check their allocated share on the WazirX app & website. Zettai remains committed… pic.twitter.com/9OwXzs7vEm — WazirX: India Ka Bitcoin Exchange (@WazirXIndia) February 10, 2025 Profit Sharing: A Limited Window for Users Some aspects of the compensation plan have raised eyebrows. WazirX has made it clear that users will receive a share of the DEX’s profits, but that arrangement is only for a period of three years. After that, affected users won’t receive any more profits, even though the DEX will continue to operate. Conversely, WazirX’s leadership will continue to rake in the profits for as long as the DEX operates and turns a profit. Users are made whole and potentially profitable in the short run; the long run, however, seems to reward the platform’s upper management far more than it rewards users. What Does This Mean for the Future of WazirX? WazirX compensating users and developing a decentralized exchange demonstrates that the platform is trying to learn from its past mistakes. These two actions could restore trust within the crypto community and WazirX itself. However, the company still has work to do in establishing user satisfaction and confidence. That’s because the dual moves of compensation and establishment of a decentralized exchange really aren’t much if only 85% of users’ losses are reimbursed and the decentralized exchange is set to go live in an unspecified time frame after which users can trade the crypto exchange tokens they’ve earned as dividends. The crypto industry will watch closely as WazirX builds its DEX (decentralized exchange) and continues compensating users of WazirX who were affected by the hack in August of this year. Will these efforts be sufficient for WazirX to win back the trust of the crypto community? Will the recovery serve as a reliable guide for “next time” in an industry that seems let down in the area of security? At present, WazirX is directing its attention toward rebalancing its platform, recompensing users who were directly affected by the recent events, and pushing ahead with its roadmap to a decentralized future. The next few years will be make-or-break for the exchange, and for the money raised by its parent company and used to build the exchange, as it tries to show that it can come back from the hack stronger and more secure than ever.

The flagship cryptocurrency is struggling to reclaim $96,000 and is currently trading around $95,450. BTC is down nearly 3% over the past 24 hours, oscillating in a narrow range that indicates low trading activity. The crypto market opened in the red after Tuesday’s recovery, with cryptocurrencies in the red. Ethereum (ETH) tumbled from above $2,700 to its current level of $2,580, down almost 4% over the past 24 hours, while Ripple (XRP) is down over 3%. Solana (SOL) is also in the red and has dropped below $200 to trade at $195 after a drop of nearly 5%. Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA) , Chainlink (LINK) , Tron (TRX) , Stellar (XLM) , Toncoin (TON), Litecoin (LTC) , Uniswap (UNI), Hedera (HBAR), and Polkadot (DOT) also registered heavy losses. The crypto market cap is down over 2% and currently sits at $3.13 trillion. US Regulators Must Prioritize Crypto Clarity Bitstamp US CEO Bobby Zagotta believes US regulators must prioritize crypto clarity like the EU’s Markets for Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA). MiCA is a set of rules and regulations designed to regulate the crypto market in the EU. The idea behind the rules and regulations is to bring more legal clarity and consumer protection while promoting innovation. However, some worry that regulation brings more trouble than good. Tether’s Paolo Ardoino shares this view, stating that MiCA’s regulatory move puts banking systems and the use of stablecoins in the European bloc at a systemic risk because MiCA requires stablecoin issuers in Europe to keep at least 60% of their assets in Europe-based bank accounts. SEC And Binance Seek Pause In Lawsuit The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Binance have filed a joint motion to pause their legal case for 60 days. This is the first time a major crypto litigation has been paused since Mark Uyeda took over as acting Chair of the SEC. The motion was filed on February 10 and cited the establishment of the SEC’s crypto task force as the reason for the pause. The SEC and Binance stated in the motion, “The work of this task force may impact and facilitate the potential resolution of this case.” The SEC and Binance plan to issue a joint report on whether the stay must continue after 60 days. “As this is a joint motion, there is no prejudice to any party here, and a stay could save the parties resources because, if an early resolution could be reached, it would obviate the need to continue merits discovery.” A spokesperson for Binance stated, “We are grateful to interim Chairman Uyeda for his thoughtful approach to ensuring digital assets receive the appropriate legislative and regulatory focus in this new, golden era of blockchain in the US and around the world.” The SEC’s Crypto Task Force has been tasked with establishing a regulatory framework for the crypto industry in the US, and is led by SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce, who has supported crypto for years. Pierce has been critical of the SEC’s approach towards crypto under Gary Gensler and described the agency’s handling of crypto as legally imprecise and commercially impractical. “Many cases remain in litigation, many rules remain in the proposal stage, and many market participants remain in limbo. Determining how best to disentangle all these strands, including ongoing litigation, will take time. It will involve working across the whole agency and cooperating with other regulators. Please be patient.” Jerome Powell Calls For Fresh Look At Debanking Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell believes it is time for a fresh approach to debanking after criticism that the crypto industry is being shut out of banking services. Powell made the comments during a Senate Banking Committee hearing when the committee’s chair, Tim Scott, asked if Powell would work with him to ensure that financial rules don’t impose more burden than necessary. “I will commit to working with you on that. We try to avoid excessive burden. Look, I think it's fair to take a fresh look, frankly, on debanking. We don't intentionally do these things, but sometimes regulation leads things to happen, and we need to be working on that.” Powell was also asked if he would work with lawmakers to end debanking, to which he responded in the affirmative. Crypto firms have struggled with establishing and maintaining accounts in the US. Coinbase had to sue the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation last year, accusing the agency of attempting to cut off crypto from the banking sector. Big bank CEOs have also spoken about their troubles with crypto. Powell admitted he was struck by the scale of debanking, stating, “I will tell you that I am struck and my colleagues and I are struck by the growing number of cases of what appears to be debanking and we're determined to take a fresh look at that.” Powell has said banks can serve crypto customers if they can manage the risk. “The threshold has been a little higher for banks engaging in crypto activities, and that's because they're so new.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is down nearly 3% over the past 24 hours after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned against rate cuts. Powell cited elevated inflation and a tight labor market for maintaining the Fed’s hawkish stance. The Fed Chair’s comments come after a drop in the unemployment rate, resilient wage growth, and persistent inflation pressures. As a result, BTC’s price action remained muted as the flagship cryptocurrency lost more ground on Tuesday, briefly dipping below $95,000. BTC has traded in a narrow range since last week, with fears of a global trade war impacting market sentiment and risk appetite. President Donald Trump also announced tariffs on aluminum and steel. Markets are waiting for the consumer price index (CPI) numbers, due on Wednesday, to gauge the Fed’s rate outlook. BTC could see movement once the numbers are out. However, the Fed is expected to keep interest rates high and is likely to postpone interest rate cuts until next year due to concerns about rising inflation, thanks to Trump’s tariff policy. A higher interest rate could adversely impact crypto by reducing investor appetite for risk assets. Higher interest rates increase borrowing costs and lead to a slowdown in economic activity and a shift of capital from risk assets to safer assets. BTC is trading below $96,000, with sellers looking to seize the opportunity and drive the price towards $90,000.A drop to this level could trigger buying activity if traders buy the dip. BTC remains tethered between $94,000 and $108,000, with the range narrowing further this week as price action and momentum slowed. BTC made a strong recovery on Monday after plummeting to an intraday low of $91,274, reclaiming $100,000 and settling at $101,579. Despite the recovery, BTC was back in the red on Tuesday, dropping below $100,000 and the 50-day SMA to $97,983. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as the price fell 1.34% to $96,668. BTC attempted to reclaim $100,000 on Thursday as it reached an intraday high of $99,237. However, it could not stay at this level and ultimately dropped to $96,641. Source: TradingView BTC briefly crossed $100,000 on Friday, reaching an intraday high of $100,222. However, selling pressure forced buyers into a retreat, and BTC settled at $96,634. Price action was muted over the weekend as BTC registered a marginal increase on Saturday and a marginal decline on Sunday to settle at $96,526. BTC encountered volatility on Monday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. BTC ultimately registered an increase of 0.98% and settled at $97,468. However, it lost momentum on Tuesday, falling to move past the 50-day SMA and dropping nearly 2% to slip below $96,000 and settle at $95,801. The current session sees BTC marginally up as it looks to reclaim $96,000. Buyers must keep BTC above $96,000 to prevent a further decline. However, if they are overwhelmed and sellers take control, BTC could plummet to $90,000. The RSI remains below the neutral zone, while the MACD remains bearish. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) price action remains muted as it struggles to remain above $2,600, with the price only marginally up during the current session. Despite starting the year above $3,000, ETH has underperformed since the beginning of the year. The asset has lost significant value and dipped below $3,000 at the beginning of February and has struggled to bounce back, dipping below key support levels. ETH’s collapse on Monday saw the price dip to $2,160 before bouncing back. ETH ultimately reclaimed $2,800 and settled at $2,882, registering a marginal increase. However, it could not sustain its relief rally and was back in the red on Tuesday, dropping over 5% to an intraday low of $2,636 before settling at $2,732. ETH recovered on Wednesday, rising just over 2% and settling at $2,789. However, it fell back on Thursday, dropping nearly 4% to slip below $2,700 and settle at $2,688. ETH attempted a recovery on Friday, reaching an intraday high of $2,798 before losing momentum and dropping 2.42% to $2,623. Source: TradingView ETH’s price action was subdued over the weekend as it registered a marginal increase on Saturday and a marginal decline on Sunday to settle at $2,628. ETH briefly dipped below $2,600 on Monday as it fell to an intraday low of $2,561. However, it recovered to register an increase of 1.30% and settled at $2,663. Buyers attempted to reclaim $2,700 on Tuesday as ETH rose to an intraday high of $2,727 before dropping 2.25% and settling at $2,603. The current session sees ETH marginally up as it struggles to remain above $2,600. If ETH drops below this level, it could fall to $2,500. A break below this level could drag the price to $2,000-$2,100. ETH must reclaim $2,700 for bullish sentiment to return. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL)’s recent momentum has stalled as it failed to move past and consolidate above $200. SOL was bearish at the beginning of the previous week, dropping to an intraday low of $176 before recovering to settle at $216. It fell back on Tuesday, dropping 4.51% to slip below the 50-day SMA and settle at $206. Bearish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as SOL fell over 5%, slipping below $200 and settling at $196. Buyers attempted a recovery on Thursday as SOL reached an intraday high of $204. However, it could not stay at this level and fell back, dropping just over 3% to $189. Source: TradingView Bullish sentiment returned on Friday as SOL reached an intraday high of $203 before settling at $192, an increase of 1.34%. Bullish sentiment intensified on Saturday as SOL rose nearly 4% and settled at $199. SOL saw volatility on Sunday as sellers attempted to thwart a move past $200. SOL ultimately registered a marginal increase and settled at $200. Volatility persisted on Monday as SOL fell to an intraday low of $196 and rose to an intraday high of $209 before settling back at $200. Sellers gained the upper hand on Tuesday as SOL dropped 1.24% to $190. The current session sees SOL down almost 1% as sellers look to drive SOL lower. The RSI and MACD indicate that sellers have the advantage, and SOL could see a further decline in the near term. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Analysis Dogecoin (DOGE) is trading in a narrow range as it struggles to build momentum after last week’s dramatic collapse. DOGE fell to an intraday low of $0.203 last Monday before recovering to register an increase of nearly 7% and settle at $0.286. DOGE was back in the red on Tuesday, dropping almost 8% and settling at $0.264. Sellers retained control on Wednesday, and the price dropped 3.14% to $0.256.

The current session sees DOGE marginally up and trading around $0.254. Bittensor (TAO) Price Analysis Bittensor (TAO) was bearish for most of last week but began a rally on Friday and is testing the resistance at $400. As with other cryptocurrencies, TAO registered a substantial drop on Monday, plummeting to an intraday low of $329. However, it made a stunning recovery from this level, surging over 14% to settle at $400. However, TAO could not sustain this rally and fell back in the red on Tuesday, dropping over 10% to $358. TAO continued to drop on Wednesday, falling over 2% to $349. Buyers attempted a recovery on Thursday as TAO surged to an intraday high of $376. It lost momentum after reaching this level and dropped nearly 7% to $326. Source: TradingView A drop of just over 2% on Friday saw TAO fall to $319.

40232407,https://nulltx.com/?p=144622,1739354747,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,BNB Chain Ecosystem Set for Explosive Growth Following New Developments,https://nulltx.com/bnb-chain-ecosystem-set-for-explosive-growth-following-new-developments/,"In recent days, the BNB Chain ecosystem has been generating a lot of excitement in the cryptocurrency community. The reason for this newfound attention? A memecoin called #TST (Test Token) that was released on the BNB Chain and was almost immediately listed on Binance, one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges. This unexpected enthusiasm for the BNB Chain has many people wondering whether the ecosystem is on the verge of a serious expansion, with the possibility of making a huge run like other blockchain ecosystems—Solana and Tron, to name two—that have done similarly well in the past. A New Milestone for BNB Chain The BNB Chain has been moving upwards, and the latest happenings suggest that it may be set for an even bigger breakout. One of the most striking milestones the network has recently attained is exceeding 500 million unique addresses. This achievement attests to the BNB Chain’s increasing popularity and to how its adoption is gaining steam. The network has earned its newfound respect for how it handles scalability, for its low transaction fees, and for how fast it is building up an ecosystem of dApps and tokens. 𝐈𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐁𝐍𝐁 𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐢𝐧 𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐬𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦 𝐠𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐨 𝐬𝐤𝐲𝐫𝐨𝐜𝐤𝐞𝐭 𝐧𝐞𝐱𝐭? … — Wise Advice (@wiseadvicesumit) February 11, 2025 Not without cause is the attention that the BNB Chain is getting. It can support a seemingly endless variety of decentralized projects, including DeFi protocols and NFTs, making it a go-to platform for many developers and users. The launch of #TST, a memecoin that quickly built up some serious momentum and made its way onto Binance, has only added to the BNB Chain’s visibility. Similarities to Other Ecosystem Booms The hype often drives the market for cryptocurrencies. This is evident when we observe that ecosystems like Solana and Tron enjoyed massive price rallies when they began capturing the public’s attention. For instance, Solana’s price skyrocketed as it found favor in the burgeoning decentralized finance (DeFi) space and among developers enticed by its fast transaction speeds. Meanwhile, Tron’s ecosystem tended to benefit from the high-profile partnerships and projects that seemed to propel its token price to new heights. Currently, numerous analysts are making comparisons between the present surge propelling the BNB Chain and the nascent phases of Solana and Tron’s ascendance. The current buzz around the #TST token listing, coupled with the reality that the BNB Chain has now surpassed 500 million unique addresses, hints at the potential dawn of a new growth cycle. Although it is still early, the trajectory of other ecosystems in the same boat provides an optimistic perspective for the BNB Chain. If the current state of affairs continues, we’ll see a nice uptick in user adoption and token prices—most likely within the next few months—that should mirror what happened with Solana and Tron during their respective heyday. $LISTA: A Leading Indicator for BNB Chain’s Potential Right now, one of the standout tokens on the BNB Chain is $LISTA, a token that has been creating a buzz in the crypto space. In fact, $LISTA is currently the top gainer on Binance, and it’s also at the top of the charts for Daily Social Volume Growth over the past 24 hours. This strong performance only adds to the narrative that BNB Chain tokens are gaining traction, and not just with retail investors. Top-13 gainers by Daily Social Volume Growth Introducing #PJTs with the highest level of daily social volume increase, showing an increased interest in the PJTs within the last 24H. $LISTA $AIXBT $ATN $EPS $FLOCK $HEGE $SNX $ONT $KDA $BIO $OGN $BLUR $CTSI pic.twitter.com/cmF7grvEUR — Cryptolaxy #StandWithUkraine (@Cryptolaxy) February 11, 2025 The achievement of $LISTA is not a singular event; it emphasizes the mounting appeal of tokens on the BNB Chain and points toward an ecosystem that could pull in an even larger number of projects, all of which might benefit from this attention. And the social volume of these projects is growing, too: In a recent week, our old friend the BNB blockchain ecosystem accounted for six of the 10 most-discussed tokens across social media. The increase in social activity and the unique addresses on the network indicate an ecosystem that is quickly gaining ground. If projects like $LISTA keep becoming popular, then BNB Chain could very well establish itself among the leading contenders in the blockchain space. The Road Ahead: Can BNB Chain Continue to Ride the Wave? With the BNB Chain ecosystem drawing ever more visibility, the real question is: can it sustain this growth and keep building on the recent successes that have come its way? No doubt, the recent attention is a feather in the cap of the overall BNB Chain ecosystem. But we should also be careful to take all this in: the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, and attention alone does not guarantee long-term success. Even so, BNB Chain possesses numerous advantages that seem to ensure its continued growth. Its concentration on scalability, low costs, and a developer-friendly atmosphere has already snagged a diversifying array of projects. With still more tokens in its orbit gaining traction, and interest from both retail investors and developers swelling, the BNB Chain appears very well-positioned to push out its boundaries even further. An increasing count of distinct addresses on the network is also a healthy sign, indicating that not just is the platform being experimented with, but that users are also becoming more involved in the ecosystem. This kind of involvement is essential for any blockchain ecosystem that aspires to long-term survival and success. As the market keeps changing, the BNB Chain must keep moving and fulfill the promise of scalability and low transaction costs. If it can, then there’s no telling how far it might go, becoming the next significant blockchain ecosystem to experience explosive growth. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

This intriguing move involves a meme coin with the potential for massive gains. As Bitcoin, Solana, , , and continue to make waves, this development is capturing attention. The market atmosphere is bullish, encouraging exploration of high-potential projects. The focus now is on a mysterious project, Mission Briefing: Agent A.I. This meme-inspired venture claims to combine humor with potential financial returns. With a community-driven presale, the project promises excitement and rewards to early participants. As the crypto landscape evolves, the question remains: will Agent A.I. become the next big success story, or just a fleeting trend? Artificial Idiot Among Us: Agent A.I. Denounces Fake AI Agents The crypto underworld is infested with fake AI agents —shady operators promising “next-gen intelligence” while barely outsmarting a toaster. This nonsense ends today. Agent A.I. has come to denounce fake AI agents. This ultimate undercover agent does not pretend, it is a 100% meme coin . Agent A.I. is on a mission of mass hilarity (and, naturally, ridiculous gains). Classified Intel: Agent A.I.’s True Identity Keep this under wraps: Agent A.I. is a Pepe in disguise. Modeled after the legendary PEPE coin, which skyrocketed nearly 22,000%, this covert operative has the same ambition. Will it succeed? That depends on its community. Your Directive: Secure Your Position in the Agent A.I. Mission Unlike VC-backed rug pulls, Agent A.I. is powered by the people. The bigger the support, the higher it moonwalks. That’s why it has chosen the community-driven presale strategy with a smart plan: Entry Price at Stage One: $0.003333333 (because three is a lucky number) Final Stage Price: $0.151515152 (because round numbers are boring) First-Stage Discount: 98% Translation: Buy early, pay less. Post-Presale Mission Expansion Think of the presale as a training for the big mission. Once the $AGNT token goes public, the mission will expand to strategic KOL partnerships and development of AI powered tools to fuel growth and engagement. Top-Secret Tokenomics (No Funny Business) This is a community-first operation, so 25% the total token supply is allocated for staking and rewards. Agent A.I. isn’t just throwing tokens around like confetti. The supply is capped at 5 billion, ensuring no surprise inflation bombs. Further breaking down the tokemonics, only 20% of the supply is allocated for the presale. The offer at a discounted price is limited. Final Orders: Deploy Capital & Secure Your $AGNT Now This is your shot to join crypto’s most ridiculous yet lucrative mission. The best entries go to the fastest trigger fingers. Don’t be the guy who “wished he got in early.” The mission is set. The presale is live. Are you in, or will you let the AI fakes win? Buy $AGNT Early for a Bigger Discount Bitcoin Shows Signs of Growth Amid Recent Fluctuations Bitcoin’s current price hovers between $90970 and $102390, marking a slight decrease of -3.18% over the past week. This dip follows a monthly gain of 4.07%, indicating recent volatility in the market. Over the past six months, Bitcoin has surged by 67.47%. This significant increase demonstrates strong market confidence and suggests a bullish trend in the long term. The nearest resistance level is at $108252. If the price breaks through this point, it could signal further upward movement. On the downside, the nearest support level is at $85412, which may provide stability if the price drops. With an RSI of 63.07, Bitcoin is approaching overbought territory but hasn’t reached it yet. This suggests there may still be room for price growth before a potential correction occurs. Solana (SOL) Eyes Breakout Amid Market Volatility Solana has had a mixed performance recently. In the past week, its price dipped by 5.42%. Yet, over the past month, it climbed 8.95%, and over six months, it surged by 42.33%. This suggests underlying strength despite short-term fluctuations. Trading between $177.92 and $221.63, Solana is approaching its resistance level at $242.68. Breaking this level could lead to significant gains. The support level at $155.26 provides a cushion against further declines. With an RSI of 56.73, Solana is in a neutral zone, indicating potential for upward movement. The positive trends over the past month and six months suggest that the coin may continue to grow. If Solana surpasses the resistance, it could rise by around 10% from current prices. However, failing to hold above support might result in a similar percentage drop. Traders are keen to see if Solana will capitalize on its recent momentum. Conclusion As the bull run accelerates, traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Solana continue to show steady growth, but their short-term potential may be less compared to emerging projects. Investors are looking beyond these established coins for opportunities that offer higher returns in the rapidly evolving market.

40232447,https://coinpedia.org/?p=418853,1739354875,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,Trump Plans to Appoint Pro-Crypto Brian Quintenz as CFTC Chair,https://coinpedia.org/news/trump-plans-to-appoint-pro-crypto-brian-quintenz-as-cftc-chair/,"The post Trump Plans to Appoint Pro-Crypto Brian Quintenz as CFTC Chair appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News At a time when the crypto community is discussing the importance of establishing a crypto-friendly regulatory environment in the US for the growth of the cryptocurrency industry in the country, an official document, which suggests the possibility of the appointment of a pro-crypto executive by US President Donald Trump to lead the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, has been published by a prominent media outlet . According to the document, the Trump administration is planning to appoint Brian Quintenz, the head of global policy at a16z crypto, as the new chairman of the CFTC. Trump’s Plan to Nominate Brian Quintenz The official document, sent by the White House to Capitol Hill, confirms that Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump is an American former president politician, businessman, and media personality, who served as the 45th president of the U.S. between 2017 to 2021. Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President is preparing to appoint Quintenz as the new chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. It is not the first time that Quintenz has had a chance to play a key role in the commission. Notably, during the first Trump administration, he was the commissioner of the commodity futures regulatory agency. Undoubtedly, Quintenz is a pro-crypto executive. The company where he works right now, a16z crypto, is a venture capital fund that invests in crypto and web3 startups. Significance of Appointing a Pro-Crypto Leader as CFTC Chair The Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulates derivatives markets, including crypto futures and options. Crypto companies prefer the CFTC over the SEC, as the commission has a more open approach and sees cryptos as commodities, not securities. Appointing a pro-crypto leader as the chair of the CFTC is a big deal because it could bring clearer, fairer and more supportive regulations for the crypto industry. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : SEC’s Peirce Says Most Memecoins Aren’t Securities: Was Gensler Wrong All Along? , Support to Quintenz from Key Leaders CFTC Acting Chair Caroline Pham expresses her happiness and excitement about the Trump administration’s plan to appoint Quintenz as the chair of the community futures regulator. She recalls crucial projects that she successfully completed with the support of Quintenz while he was working as the commissioner of the CFTC. Meanwhile, expressing his extreme happiness about the plan, Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith projects Quintenz’s real experience in the crypto industry as a key reason why he is highly suitable for the position. In conclusion, Brian Quintenz’s potential appointment as CFTC chair could shape the future of crypto regulation in the US. His pro-crypto stance may create a more favourable regulatory environment, benefiting crypto companies and investors alike. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

40232520,https://nulltx.com/?p=144621,1739354972,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,CoreDAO Sees Remarkable Growth in Developer Adoption and Network Activity in 2024,https://nulltx.com/coredao-sees-remarkable-growth-in-developer-adoption-and-network-activity-in-2024/,"CoreDAO has recently revealed an astonishing rise in developer activity and network acceptance throughout 2024, cementing its place as a major player in the fast-expanding BTCfi ecosystem. With more than 2,000 developers on board, over 31,500 smart contracts deployed, and a global community that keeps growing, Core is establishing itself as the go-to space for technological innovation on the Bitcoin network. The coding activity that is “through the roof,” as one Core person puts it, is being matched by growing excitement and trust in this community and in the future of Core itself. Developer Adoption and Ecosystem Momentum The announcement from CoreDAO accompanies some eye-catching numbers that truly underscore the dynamic expansion of the ecosystem. In 2024, Core welcomed over 2,000 new developers. More than anything else, this figure reflects the vibrant decentralized development community that is taking shape. Onboarding this many developers into any platform in a single year is impressive—but for a nascent platform like Core, it is quite the achievement. The Core mainnet’s smart contract deployment is imparting growing momentum in this space. Over 31,500 smart contracts have been deployed—successfully—to the network, underpinning such a variety of decentralized applications that one can reasonably think of Core as being decentralized app-friendly. In fact, we could go so far as to say that the apps on Core are encouraging some of that good, old-fashioned app store vibes that are a part of any resilient blockchain network. Whether it’s for payments, content storage, insurance, or some currently unimaginable use, the presence of more than 250 live projects on the network confirms that good ol’ downside risk is more than covered by an upside opportunity. The growth of Core has been supported by a very large increase in development contributions, which is evidenced by the 827% year-of-year rise in GitHub commits. The network recorded over 3,747 GitHub commits, highlighting an active and engaged developer community that is continuing to push forward the boundaries of what is possible on the Core network. This code activity is a very strong signal that the Core network is a live platform not just under theoretical development but evolving in a clear direction with real technical progress. Strengthening the Developer Community Deliberate has been made by CoreDAO to engage and grow its developer community—a devoted community that has been number one for some time. More than 50 events specifically for our developer-focused community have been held around the world in 2024. These events have been led by contributors who work with Core and have been supported by a team of more than 30 Tech Ambassadors. I think a couple of things are really nice about these events. One is that they have attracted thousands of attendees and become a key part of the Core ecosystem; you can’t really develop alongside Core without being a part of these events in some way. Another nice thing is that the events have provided an opportunity for the developers with Core to really showcase what they do on the global stage. Alongside local gatherings, CoreDAO has prioritized education. Their developer education program has attracted over 10,000 enrollees, with courses tailored to the specific stack and tools of the Core network. These services are now part of CoreDAO’s mandate. There is a natural synergy between teaching developers what they need to know and seeing them build “next-gen” solutions on the network. This is exactly what CoreDAO seeks to achieve both through their own programming and through what has become their standard operating procedure in serving local communities. Core Network Achieves Record-Breaking Transaction Volumes When it comes to network activity, Core has shown remarkable scalability and widespread acceptance. In 2024, the network executed an awesome 329.3 million transactions, demonstrating its capability of hosting a high-volumed activity. Even more impressive was the peak of 1,736,695 daily transactions and 453,649 new daily addresses. Of course, that peak didn’t count in a few days here and there. And on average, over the first four months of 2024, Core processed 336,460 daily activities—growing consistently. Core developer activity SURGED in 2024. • 10,000+ Devs enrolled in Core Dev Courses • 2,000+ Devs onboarded • 31,000+ Smart Contracts deployed Devs are all-in on BTCfi. Learn about all the growth in the new Core blog! https://t.co/gcKkRUgds1 — Core DAO (@Coredao_Org) February 10, 2025 Core’s user base saw a sharp increase in activity and reached an all-time high of 822,653 daily active users. This is a clear indicator of the engagement and demand for Core’s network and services. There is a near-exponential growth of users adopting the ecosystem that is being built. This user growth is also being taken up by more developers as there is now an increasing demand for “what is being built” within the network. Strong Integration with Bitcoin Miners and Staking Another impressive accomplishment is Core’s integration with Bitcoin miners. Presently, around 75% of the hashrate from Bitcoin miners is delegated to the Core Network. This statistic alone shows there is a high degree of trust, and indeed, a high degree of collaboration, between the community of Bitcoin miners and the Core Network. And those who issue this high amount of hashrate also happen to be the very individuals who secure the Core Network and, by extension, the positions of the Bitcoin miners themselves. The network has also witnessed a notable degree of staking activity, with more than 177 million CORE tokens and 8,200 BTC at present staked on the network. This excellent amount of staking not only bulks up the network’s security but also indicates the kind of confidence that users and investors have in the long-term prospects of Core. If Core’s staking volume continues to grow, its ecosystem will not only grow at a much greater speed but also at a much greater level of security and decentralization—two hallmarks of an excellent blockchain. A Bright Future for CoreDAO CoreDAO’s incredible growth in 2024 reflects the platform’s superb demand and the developer community’s burgeoning trust in its functionalities. With rock-solid developer adoption, the launch of many thousands of smart contracts, and a network that now seems to handle millions of transactions with ease, Core is on its way to being something of a heavy hitter in the BTCfi world; when we say BTCfi, we mean Bitcoin DeFi, of course. No matter how you slice it, Core’s future looks promising, with even more developers, users, and projects expected to come aboard and ride this next wave of blockchain innovation.

40235198,https://coinpedia.org/?p=418924,1739360319,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,Ripple vs SEC: Are We Finally Close to XRP’s Legal Resolution?,https://coinpedia.org/news/ripple-vs-sec-are-we-finally-close-to-xrps-legal-resolution/,"The post Ripple vs SEC: Are We Finally Close to XRP’s Legal Resolution? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ripple (XRP) is buzzing again, this time, it’s all about the legal drama with the U.S. SEC. Investors are anxiously waiting to see if the SEC will finally drop its decade-long case against Ripple. There’s even talk that other crypto lawsuits, like the ones against Coinbase and Binance, might be dismissed too. But there is more than we see, the SEC seems to be on pause mode, and top lawyers think they know why. Let’s dive into the mixed bag of opinions. What’s Slowing Down the SEC? The delay isn’t just random—it’s got a lot to do with changes happening inside the SEC. Recently, the SEC and Binance agreed to pause their case for 60 days , sparking rumors that something bigger is brewing. Pro-XRP lawyer James Murphy aka MetaLawMan thinks this pause is strategic. He believes the SEC is waiting for Paul Atkins to be confirmed as the new SEC Chair before making any big moves. The idea is that the SEC wants stable leadership to back such major decisions. Moreover, everybody is waiting for Paul Atkins once he’s officially confirmed, experts believe the SEC could fast-track dismissing these crypto cases. According to Murphy, Atkins’ confirmation could happen in less than 60 days. Meanwhile, people are watching the Coinbase lawsuit closely, especially with a February 14 deadline looming. But if Coinbase’s request for an appeal is accepted, the SEC might not need to do much until Atkins takes over. Lawyers Disagree on the Hold-Up Not everyone agrees on why the SEC is dragging its feet. XRP lawyer Bill Morgan questioned why the SEC can’t just vote now to dismiss the cases. Murphy argues there’s no real legal barrier—the SEC could act if they wanted to. But former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel points out that dismissing lawsuits requires formal commissioner votes, unlike other decisions that don’t need one. So technically, the SEC can move forward, but they might be choosing to wait for Atkins to avoid any internal conflicts. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why XRP Price Is Dropping Today: Will Inflation Data Release Today Help It Recover? , XRP’s Current Sentiment Despite the lawsuit delay, Crypto expert EGRAG CRYPTO predicts big gains for XRP, suggesting it could hit double digits this cycle and even reach triple digits in the future. Using chart patterns like the “cup pattern,” he explains that XRP’s price movement is unfolding as expected after a breakout. His analysis points to potential price targets around $13 initially, with higher possibilities ranging from $32 to $110, based on technical indicators and data. In the meanwhile, there are growing rumors that an XRP ETF might get approved soon , which could mean the Ripple vs. SEC case is close to ending. The SEC needs to settle this case before it can approve an XRP ETF. XRP’s price is also waiting for this decision, as a positive outcome could push it higher. https://twitter.com/w_thejazz/status/1888955517424549936 .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

DEX Screener was once a go-to tool for tracking decentralized exchange activity. Traders relied on it to find new tokens across multiple blockchain networks, analyze charts, and gain early access to tokens not yet widely recognized. But lately, things have taken a quick U-turn. Instead of a platform for discovery, it’s turning into a hotspot for scammers. At least, that’s what some in the industry are claiming. Today marks 6 months since launch. In the last 12 hours, we were featured on $TRUMP’s website as THE way to buy, processed nearly $400m in volume, crushed fiat onramp records by orders of magnitude, and brought 200k+ new people onchain. We have an extremely high load right now… — Moonshot (@moonshot) January 18, 2025 Conor Grogan, head of product business operations at Coinbase, appears to be frustrated with what DEX Screener has become. According to him, the platform has embraced “dark patterns” by promoting scams and prioritizing paid fraudulent listings over legitimate projects. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen such a widely used website steer into dark patterns like Dexscreener has. Nearly the entire front page is promoted bundled scams, and if you search for a real coin CA [contract address], scams are actively boosted ahead of the token. They are making $200M/yr off this.” Conor Grogan Created in 2021 by Alexandre Bini and Andreas Diegues, DEX Screener started as a data analytics platform for decentralized finance. It tracks live token prices, liquidity, and historical charts across such networks as Solana, Ethereum, Base, and many others. Users can find tokens like Coke On Sol (COKE), a Coca-Cola knockoff, Robinhood (HOOD), named after the trading app, and Harry Pothead (POT), which has on its logo the famous wizard. DEX Screener interface | Source: DEX Screener On top of boosting tokens on the website, DEX Screener is also seemingly making a lot of money from fees. According to 0xngmi, the founder of DefiLlama, DEX Screener was pulling in a moment up to $250,000 a day by charging teams to update their token’s branding and info. just started tracking dexscreener fees on defillama they're making 150-250k/day by charging 300$ per token to add information like tg link and picture https://t.co/ECJCMmvSGd pic.twitter.com/lyWVhYR6Ym — 0xngmi (@0xngmi) August 15, 2024 It looks like that business model paid off. According to data from crypto venture fund Hashed shows DEX Screener earned more than $50 million in fees, while DefiLlama reports the platform is generating over $250 million annually. DEX Screener platform quickly became a favorite among traders on the lookout for fresh opportunities. It became a must-have in the decentralized finance space, especially for those trying to spot the next big thing before it hits the centralized exchanges. But Grogan’s claim suggests a shift in how the platform operates. He implies that DEX Screener is not just showing market data — it’s influencing what users see. And, according to him, it’s boosting scam tokens ahead of legitimate ones. Best tech in business So, is DexScreener really full of scams? Well, that actually depends on how you define it. The platform does allow token creators to pay for promoted listings, pushing their projects to the top of search results and homepage recommendations. As of press time, DEX Screener notes that those seeking “an advertising solution that requires customization to your exact needs” would have to be ready to spend $100,000 on this as well as “users and companies will have to pass the verification process, including KYC, to be able to launch their campaigns.” DEX Screener’s ads page | Source: DEX Screener In theory, this should help highlight promising new projects. But in practice, it seems to be a different story. Many of these promoted tokens turn out to be low-quality at best — and outright scams at worst. The irony is that this isn’t new for crypto. The industry has long faced issues with bad actors using paid promotions to deceive unsuspecting investors. For instance, scammers frequently exploit Google Ads, impersonating in advertisements legitimate projects to steal funds from users. You might also like: Cybercriminals launch new crypto scam using Google Ads The concern with DEX Screener is how aggressive and widespread it has become. When searching for a token by its contract address, fake listings may appear before the legitimate one. This poses a danger, especially for newcomers or those easily caught up in FOMO, who rely on DEX Screener’s data to make quick decisions. Grogan admits that DEX Screener has some of the “best tech in the business,” adding that he hopes the platform would rethink its strategy. While DEX Screener’s analytics appear to be effective for traders, the high number of questionable ads raises concerns about whether the platform is still living up to its original goal of serving customers. Crypto.news reached out to the DEX Screener team multiple times but didn’t hear back by the time of this public. We’ll update the article once and if we get the response.

The Hang Seng Tech index, which tracks the 30 biggest tech companies listed in Hong Kong, went up by 25%. According to reports , the Hang Seng Index is now worth 10.2 times its estimated earnings, up from as low as 8 times in late 2023. This makes it the second-cheapest big market in the world. Last month, the start-up shocked Silicon Valley when it released a large language model (LLM) using money it claimed was raised from friends and family. According to analysts, investors now have a new theory that China is making progress on LLMs and that consumer-facing businesses could soon start using them. This means that the tables have turned to China being better at making tech more available and popular to more people. Companies that work with cloud computing and tech hardware and stand to gain from AI advances have led the rally. In the past month, Chinese markets have entered a bull market ahead of the Nasdaq 100 and the “Magnificent Seven” US tech giants. This has increased China’s confidence, which has been hit hard by worries about US President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Comparison of Chinese tech stocks and US stocks on the Nasdaq 100 in 2025. Source: Bloomberg However, they trade for about half as much as the “Magnificent Seven” US tech giants. This means that they still have a long way to go. China’s initiatives are supporting the bull market Mainland Chinese funds bought more stocks in Hong Kong this year. This is major because it adds on to their record-breaking buying spree in 2024 as a major contributor to turning the city’s key tech index into a technical bull market. Stock market data shows that the funds spent HK$138 billion ($17.7 billion) through the Stock Connect link so far this year, up to February 11. They put the most money into Hong Kong stocks since the cross-border trading link opened last year. In addition, this year’s purchases were worth almost seven times as much as the same time last year. There has been a rise in technology stocks, such as Tencent Holdings, which runs WeChat, Xiaomi, which makes smartphones, and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (SMIC), which makes chips. The most recent monthly data shows that mainland buyers bought a net of HK$43.6 billion worth of Tencent and HK$10.8 billion worth of SMIC in January. They also bought 1.2 billion Xiaomi shares and 1.5 billion Alibaba shares. Chen Ximiao, an analyst at Guotai Junan Securities in Shanghai, said, “The recovery in sentiment will propel the market further and drive the valuation expansion of the Hang Seng Index Hong Kong’s market stands out for its high-quality listings and cheap valuations.” Another factor is that onshore investors may be pushing the rally by keeping assets priced in Hong Kong’s pegged currency. This is done to protect themselves against the yuan’s falling value, which has been exacerbated by the new trade war with the US. Louis Wong, a director at Phillip Capital Management in Hong Kong, said, “The yuan is likely to further depreciate […] If mainland investors opt to [park their money] in the Hong Kong stock market, they will benefit from the adjusted exchange rate.” The US tech stock markets The Nasdaq Composite, which is heavy on tech stocks, fell behind the major averages on Tuesday. Big names like Tesla dragged it down, and worries about spending on AI continue to affect the Magnificent Seven. Chinese markets are also affecting US markets. After China’s BYD signed a deal with DeepSeek, Tesla’s price dropped more than 5%. The news comes after Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, offered to buy Microsoft’s OpenAI . CEO Sam Altman turned down the unexpected offer of $97.4 billion. The offer was a lot less than the company’s value. With the history between both CEOs, the offer was expectedly rejected. In the same light, according to Colin Rusch, an analyst at Oppenheimer Tesla has changed its focus to be a physical AI play. However, Elon Musk’s bid for Open AI is a distraction from Tesla’s problems. The bid is 38% less than Open AI’s planned capital raise in October 2024. Therefore there will be no important conversations between the two.

QCP Capital analysts stated that DXY is at risk of falling, and BTC could rise in return. He said any positive news from the macroeconomic front could trigger a sharp liquidation of long positions in DXY, increasing downward pressure and leading to a decline in DXY. He also noted that a possible decline in DXY could send risky assets like Bitcoin soaring. At this point, QCP Capital stated that the January US CPI data could act as a catalyst for a significant decline in DXY and bring an increase to BTC. Related News: How Will Inflation Data to be Announced Today Affect Bitcoin and FED? Analysts Evaluate! However, analysts noted that this situation may not immediately lift the cloud of decision on Bitcoin. At this point, analysts also stated that the large-scale liquidations in Bitcoin and altcoins last week led to a significant decrease in trader participation, and that for investors with long positions, it may be the best strategy to follow institutional flows and buy downside protection. “Given that negative news is likely priced in, we believe the USD now faces greater downside risk. Any positive news could force USD long positions to be closed en masse, potentially sending the riskier asset higher. Today's CPI data could be the catalyst that triggers a sharp downward move in DXY. For participants still holding long positions in crypto, following institutional flows and buying downside protection may be the best strategy, especially since put options remain relatively cheap for now.” *This is not investment advice.

40235505,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=694665,1739360979,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,"Japanese Companies Are Betting on $BTC, Top Presale Joins the Rush",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/japanese-microstrategy-rides-bitcoin-hype-top-presale-btc-bulll-follow/,"Several companies in Japan are staking their future on Bitcoin ($BTC) and are buying up more of the digital currency. These include a former hotel developer, a software development company, and a mobile game studio. But what’s driving them to spend billions of yen on $BTC? We’ll discuss these and more in today’s article. Plus, we’ll find out why meme coins are also following suit in their optimism for $BTC’s future. If you’re an investor betting on the cryptocurrency’s growth, you can check out BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . It’s currently one of the best presales in the market, which brings together $BTC believers to leverage its rise beyond $100K. Why Is Japan Riding the $BTC Wave? Japanese firm Metaplanet Inc. saw its stock value rise by a whopping 4,056% over the past year after adopting a ‘Bitcoin-first’ strategy. Its CEO Simon Gerovich revealed that he modeled this approach after hearing about Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy crypto plans on a podcast. Saylor’s company has since amassed $BTCs worth $45B. Metaplanet’s strategy has since drawn in more investors to the company, adding 50K more shareholders during the same period. Metaplanet isn’t the only Japanese company investing heavily in $BTC. Software developer Remixpoint Inc. said in September last year that it would invest ¥1.2B in $BTC, leading to a 300% surge in its stock price. That same company acquired 31.27 more Bitcoins in January . Meanwhile, Tokyo-based mobile game studio Gumi announced its plans to acquire ¥1B worth of $BTC over the next three months beginning this February Aside from depending on the appreciation of the cryptocurrency’s value, the company also wants to earn staking-related income from its investment. There are several reasons why some Japanese companies are buying up $BTC. For one, the US government has taken a friendlier approach to cryptocurrencies with the re-election of Donald Trump. The market reacted positively, which drove $BTC’s price to nearly $110K during Trump’s inauguration. Japan is also facing a weak yen . This is forcing local firms to look for ways to protect their finances from the continued depreciation of their currency. With Bitcoin’s bullish momentum pushing the rest of the market forward, one presale set out to ride the Bitcoin wave. Bullish $BTCBULL Also Bets on $BTC. One of the Best Presales in 2025? BTC Bull Token is another project betting heavily on $BTC’s continued rise, making it one of this year’s best presales . You can join today to buy its tokens and earn big rewards. The project’s roadmap is closely tied to $BTC, and most of its milestones are set to happen when the digital currency’s value grows. For instance, you can get free $BTC airdrops each time $BTC reaches price milestones. The first one is set when the cryptocurrency hits the $150K mark. It could be a long way from now, but $BTCBULL is playing the long game here. The project also wants to attract early birds with a 10% $BTCBULL airdrop when $BTC reaches $250K. The more tokens you buy, the bigger your share in the airdrop, so it’s a good idea to buy while it’s still pretty cheap. There are staking rewards too. This also targets early investors, trying to hook them with a higher APY over the next two years. To constantly drive up its value, $BTCBULL will also have burn milestones. Once $BTC’s value increases by 25K, the platform will burn a portion of its token supply. The project has raised nearly $1M so far and is priced at $0.002355. It has a total supply of 21B tokens and set aside 40% for PR and Marketing, signaling its goal to get as many people on board the $BTC hype train as possible. BTC Bull Token website with your $ETH or $USDT on your crypto wallet, or via your credit card. We can only expect more and more investors to buy up more $BTC. The downside is that it makes companies heavily dependent on $BTC and sensitive to its price fluctuations. Currently, though, everyone seems optimistic about the digital currency’s growth in the foreseeable future. If you want to invest in $BTCBULL, $BTC, or other cryptocurrencies, please do your own research.

The attention is now on DTX Exchange, a trading platform set to mirror the 2021 growth pattern experienced by SHIB, as a potential contender. With its presale already surging 700% to $0.16 and $13.7 million raised, industry experts believe DTX’s no KYC requirements and 1000x leverage could change crypto trading upon its Q2 launch. While SHIB fights skepticism, this new DeFi project is a potential favorite for exponential gains. The Shiba Inu UAE Partnership Fails to Increase Investor Confidence in February The SHIB initiative announced its crucial alliance with the UAE Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure to bring blockchain technology to enhance governmental operations. Establishing the deal brought initial market enthusiasm, yet Shiba Inu kept its value at $0.000016 while the monthly decline amounted to 24.98%. Despite it getting a temporary 7.04% weekly gain, investors appear skeptical as the token’s market cap remains stuck near $9.6 billion, and can’t seem to go above it. Partnerships often drive momentum, but the lack of sustained growth by Shiba Inu reflects broader concerns about its utility beyond meme-driven hype. The collaboration intends to leverage ShibOS for energy and infrastructure projects, but progress remains unclear. Meanwhile, the burn rate surged over 500% in February, removing millions of tokens from circulation. However, these efforts haven’t led to bullish momentum, with trading volume dropping 28%. Market watchers think it needs more tangible adoption to reverse its bearish trend significantly. Cardano Price Stagnates Despite Network Upgrade Announcements Cardano (ADA) recently completed its Plomin hard fork, introducing decentralized governance and voting rights for ADA holders. Despite this milestone, ADA’s price hovers around $0.8, down 20% year-to-date. Source: Cardano Price, CoinMarketCap Predictions suggest a potential rally to $2.50, but current on-chain activity shows declining user engagement, with daily transactions lagging behind rivals like Solana. Network upgrades are often positive for price, yet ADA’s stagnation shows that investors are cautious amid slower ecosystem growth. While Cardano’s long-term roadmap emphasizes scalability and Bitcoin integration, short-term uncertainty continues. Economists believe ADA’s reliance on partnerships and delayed technical milestones could reduce its ability to compete with newer projects. In contrast, tokens like DTX Exchange attract capital with clear roadmaps and immediate utility, positioning them as stronger candidates for near-term gains. DTX Exchange Nears $14 Million Milestone With No KYC Requirements As Shiba Inu and Cardano struggle, DTX Exchange emerges as a one-of-a-kind presale project, raising over $13.7 million with over 600,000 users ahead of its Q2 launch. The platform’s trading model, offering 1000x leverage on stocks, crypto, and forex, has drawn comparisons to the 2021 breakout pattern that SHIB experienced. DTX solves real-world trading challenges through features like zero KYC checks and institutional-grade security, unlike SHIB, which relies on meme virality. Experts consider DTX a good crypto, even better than Shiba Inu, due to its limited token supply and revenue-sharing model, which rewards holders with a percentage of trading fees. With the presale price at $0.16 and a listing target of $0.20, market professionals are pointing to a 100x surge post-launch, fueled by demand for decentralized yet user-friendly platforms. While Shiba Inu battles skepticism and Cardano fights stagnation, DTX’s growth strategy and $13.7 million milestone could make it a top crypto investment. Conclusion While SHIB continues to face uncertainty and Cardano’s upgrades struggle to inspire momentum, the spotlight shifts to projects showing innovation and accessibility. With its $13.7 million presale milestone and no KYC trading model, many believe DTX Exchange could mirror SHIB’s viral potential but with a focus on real-world utility.

The election of President Trump ushered in a new season for cryptocurrencies that some argue may have changed the market cycle. Meme coins have been the star highlight of the crypto space and continue to dominate as the year progresses. Innovative DeFi integrations and new ecosystem updates have been springing up so far. These trends have positioned certain projects to thrive. One of them is Chill Drone ($CHONE)—a meme-driven project. Meme Dominance: How Meme Coins are Flooding the Markets According to Coinmarketcap , the total number of cryptocurrencies in the market is almost 11 million . This number was largely amped up with the flooding of meme coins into the market. The lack of regulatory clarity around utility tokens as securities or not has made the market gravitate towards meme coins that were clearly not securities. While many investors may be patient with the long-term impact of utility projects, the need for present massive gains has overwhelmed the broader market. Meme coins offer their creators the flexibility to build around any idea, philosophy, hype, trend, or narrative, provided it can resonate with a community that will stand behind it. Meme culture has taken over the streets of the crypto market. Many aspects of different industries, from politics to entertainment to traditional institutions, are leaning into memes to raise capital, preserve a culture, or start a movement. Some meme tokens have, however, realized the fleeting nature of meme hypes without utility in the long run. That’s why a new wave of meme projects like Chill Drone ($CHONE) are working to infuse meme culture with real ecosystem value. $CHONE Could Perform Well In 2025 The current meme status of the global crypto market means that the majority of its investors are already looking towards meme coins. It also means that $CHONE is already positioned to appear before the search queries of investors. Being hosted on the Solana blockchain also gives $CHONE an extra boost in positioning. Solana is currently the meme hotspot of the crypto market, drawing about 40% of investors’ attention. The upcoming market cycle favors high-engagement and high-visibility tokens. $CHONE’s gaming feature is poised to send its engagement levels through the roof. According to its creators, $CHONE holders will enjoy real-life rewards from their active participation and weekly competitions. Chill Drone is also strengthening its sense of community by rolling out rewards for its investors in the coming week. This community-driven approach to building will equip $CHONE with the strength to ride the meme wave. It’s not clear who Chill Drone is currently partnering with, but the team has already released hints at a major partnership and major CEX listing. Meme history shows how partnerships could skyrocket projects. With $CHONE’s upcoming partnerships and ecosystem expansions, it could be the next breakout star of 2025. Is It Still Early To Invest In $CHONE? 2025 is just beginning, and a lot of narratives are still taking root in the meme market. This gives investors the opportunity to position early for major upsides in the cryptocurrency market. $CHONE currently has an under $600k market capitalization, making it a low-cap project. Oftentimes, low-cap projects are hidden gems. $CHONE checks a lot of other boxes aside from its community building, including a strong and fresh narrative. This increases its chances for an upside in the next wave.

Recent whale data by a top crypto market analyst disclosed that a whopping 600,00 coins were accumulated over the past seven days, suggesting a rally ahead for ETH price. Ethereum Bulls On Buying Spree Indicate Pump Looms According to an X post by crypto market analyst Ali Martinez on February 12, Ethereum whales purchased 600,000 coins over the past week. Further, data revealed that the massive accumulations occurred as the asset’s price plunged from the $2,800 to $2,600 level. Source: Ali Charts, X Notably, the whales’ trading strategy amid this waning action flagged a ‘buy-the-dip’ opportunity in the market. For context, heightened interest among large-scale investors amid a price drop conveys optimism about the coin’s future performance. Crypto Market Volatility: A Flash Risk? Nevertheless, it’s worth taking into account the current crypto market volatility , which is primarily attributable to macroeconomic developments. Following U.S. Fed Jerome Powell’s hawkish stance in his testimony, risk assets like crypto witnessed immense selling pressure, CoinGape reported. Further, the looming U.S. CPI and PPI data have also pushed investors to be cautious. However, the massive accumulation by Ethereum bulls indicated that the sector’s volatility may be short-lived. The massive buying flags the asset’s potential to recover from the current turbulence and offer massive gains ahead. ETH Price To Rally? Analysts Remain Bullish Sparking Optimism At the time of reporting, ETH price tanked over 4% intraday, reaching $2,601. The coin’s 24-hour bottom and high were $2,565.40 and $2,724.90, respectively. The current waning action, despite rising buying pressure, aligns with the broader crypto market trend. However, renowned market experts have conveyed remarkable optimism about the asset’s future performance. Market enthusiast ‘Merlijn The Trader’ took to X, spotlighting that ETH’s weekly chart shows the formation of a ‘Golden Cross.’ Citing historical trends, the analyst believes this to be the catalyst for a massive upside ahead. While this bullish prediction echoed a buzz, another renowned market expert offered a bullish outlook for the asset. Source: Merlijn The Trader, X ‘Ash Crypto’ has recently posted on X, saying, “Ethereum in current cycle is perfectly mimicking Bitcoin last cycle.” According to the analyst, following the completion of the ‘multi-year accumulation phase’ and ‘Re-accumulation and manipulation phase,’ the coin eyes a new ATH. Per the analyst, a $10K target “is programmed this cycle.” Overall, these bullish projections solidified investor optimism on the future performance, further escorted by the heavy whale buying.

In recent years, the January figure has tended to show significant price hikes. Last year, for example, the month's data put an end to a series of lower readings, repeating a pattern also seen in 2023. That's because businesses often evaluate their costs and raise prices at the start of the year, as the Wall Street Journal points out . A higher-than-expected inflation report could suggest “monetary policy has more work to do” Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan said in a speech last week. The Federal Reserve has already indicated it isn’t rushing to adjust interest rates after 100 basis points of reductions last year. Also playing into the consideration are the Trump administration’s tariffs, with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston pointing to a potential rise as high as 0.8% to core PCE, the inflation measure the Fed focuses on. Still, in 2018 and 2019 tariffs had negligible effects. On the other hand, a soft inflation report could be beneficial for risks assets including bitcoin. A lower-than-expected figure will probably raise interest-rate cut expectations, potentially weakening the U.S. dollar index and lowering Treasury yields, CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole has reported. Meanwhile, demand for the largest cryptocurrency holds strong. Just this week, Japanese mobile-game studio Gumi revealed plans to accumulate around $6.6 million worth of BTC, while KULR Technology Group increased its crypto holdings to 610.3 bitcoin. Similarly, Goldman Sachs' 13F filing shows the banking giant significantly increased its exposure to spot bitcoin and ether ETFs in the fourth quarter. And don't forget Strategy’s near-weekly bitcoin purchases. Bitcoin’s Coinbase premium, which measures the difference between BTC’s price on the U.S. exchange and Binance, recently turned negative , suggesting U.S. traders are cautious about the upcoming inflation report. The caution comes amid growing headwinds for the crypto market, which may have reached the top of its cycle. Research firm BCA Research has recently shared a note with clients suggesting the record ETF inflows and the memecoin craze are warning signals. Warning signals are present elsewhere, with a recent JPMorgan report pointing out that crypto ecosystem growth slowed last month, while total trading volumes dropped 24%. Activity is nevertheless ahead of where it was before the U.S. elections. Stay alert!

Following an extended break, Cardano price hit $1 once more in November 2024, representing a notable rebound from its prior high in February 2021. Nevertheless, a newcomer in the cryptocurrency field, Rexas Finance (RXS), is set to possibly surpass Cardano with notable rapidity, potentially exceeding the $1 threshold in a much shorter timeframe. Cardano Price Movements: A Gradual yet Consistent Ascent The cryptocurrency community has continuously gotten intrigued by the Cardano price movement, because of its development and adoption strategy. ADA’s value declined after it achieved the $1 mark in February 2021. The community’s patience was rewarded when Cardano reached the $1 mark again in November 2024, pausing as one of the best cryptos to buy , with a gradual yet consistent growth pattern. Despite a price drop to $0.7887, this milestone, after three years of stagnation at that point, highlights Cardano’s strength and the lasting trust investors possess in its future opportunities. However, a new token is poised to break this pattern. Unlike Cardano price, which required years to gain momentum, Rexas Finance (RXS) is emerging as a game-changer, potentially reaching the $1 mark far faster. Cardano Price price chart Introducing Rexas Finance: A Disruptive Force in Crypto Rexas Finance (RXS) is an innovative cryptocurrency that is creating a stir in the tokenization of tangible assets. Although numerous established and early-stage cryptocurrencies aim to serve as a means of exchange, RXS is transforming investment accessibility by providing entry to markets that were historically limited to institutional investors. This strategy has sparked tremendous investor enthusiasm, leading to a notable $44.3 million raised and more than 441.9 million tokens sold in its presale stage. Currently priced at $0.20, RXS is set to list at $0.25 on June 19, 2025. However, given the growing demand, the RWA token could exceed $1 before its listing, a feat that took Cardano price years to achieve. Why Rexas Finance Could Hit $1 Faster than Cardano Price Did 1. Unmatched Investor Demand The presale success of RXS is a strong indicator of its potential. Investors are flocking to the token, seeing its unique value proposition in tokenizing real-world assets. With wealthy investors and a strong community backing it, RXS is in a prime position to see rapid price appreciation. 2. Strategic Tokenomics Unlike many tokens that suffer from poor distribution models, RXS follows a structured and sustainable tokenomics model that ensures longevity and value appreciation: 25% allocated for early investors and market penetration 20% for staking rewards to incentivize ecosystem participation 30% dedicated to asset tokenization, ensuring institutional-level liquidity 15% for marketing and expansion 10% for strategic partnerships and ecosystem development This carefully designed framework improves the token’s lasting stability, appealing to both retail and institutional investors. Rexas finance tokenomics Increasing Acceptance of Tokenized Assets One of the primary reasons RXS is set for growth is its emphasis on tokenizing real-world assets. Traditional financial markets have been primarily controlled by institutional participants, resulting in restricted options for retail investors. RXS transforms the landscape by enabling regular investors to access markets that were once inaccessible. This advancement positions RXS as one of the most desired investments in the cryptocurrency market. Market Timing and Cryptocurrency Sentiment As the cryptocurrency market gains bullish momentum, fresh and inventive projects such as RXS are seeing swift adoption. Investors are actively seeking new cryptocurrencies to invest , that provide real-world applications beyond mere speculative trading. Consequently, RXS has gained momentum at an ideal moment, positioning it to exceed $1 significantly quicker than Cardano’s price did. Final Thoughts: The Road Ahead for Rexas Finance Rexas Finance is not just another crypto project; it represents a new frontier in investment accessibility. With a strong presale performance, strategic tokenomics, and growing investor interest, RXS has positioned itself as a high-growth asset that could break the $1 mark before its official listing in June 2025. While Cardano price took three years to reach $1, RXS is on track to achieve this milestone in record time. For investors looking for the next big opportunity, Rexas Finance is undoubtedly one to watch.

Visit Mind of Pepe Bitcoin - Largest Cryptocurrency By Market Capitalization As the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, Bitcoin continues to be a cornerstone of the digital asset market. Its decentralized nature and widespread adoption make it a staple in many investment portfolios, and over the years, this cryptocurrency has shown incredible resilience and growth. In recent weeks, Bitcoin's price has experienced extreme price fluctuations, influenced by macroeconomic factors such as upcoming inflation reports and, obviously, the victory of Trump in the US elections. Additionally, many crypto analysts suggest that higher-than-expected inflation could impact Federal Reserve policies, thereby potentially affecting Bitcoin's appeal to investors. It is also important to note that some analysts have cautioned that if Bitcoin's price falls below the $92,000 support level, it could decline further to around $80,000. However, others remain optimistic about its long-term potential, especially with increasing institutional interest. As of the time of writing, Bitcoin is currently trading at $98,000 per BTC/USD, and the Bitcoin TD sequential indicator has issued a buy signal, indicating a possible continuation of the bullish uptrend. Also, there have been several predictions that BTC could possibly reach the $150,000 mark in the first half of the year and 185,000 by year-end. For long-term investors, Bitcoin’s established history of growth, along with its fixed supply and strong network, makes it a reliable long-term investment.

This Best Card will offer cashback on purchases and reduced transaction fees for users who hold and stake $BEST tokens. With so many features and with such a unique wallet ecosystem, it is not a surprise that many analysts believe that $BEST can be the next 100x crypto coin. https://youtu.be/lGZrb_MzQM4?si=K1phtUyeP7PbafLc The $BEST token is currently available for purchase through its presale, with a current price of just $0.02395 per token.

Visit Best Wallet Token Presale Trump Coin - Meme Coin Launched By President Donald Trump Trump coin, a meme coin that was launched on the 17th of January,2025, allegedly by the 47th U.S. president, Donald Trump, is a politically themed cryptocurrency that has garnered significant attention. In less than two weeks after its launch, entities behind $TRUMP generated almost $100 million in trading fees. $TRUMP experienced a peak shortly after its release and even achieved its all-time high of $77.24 on the 19th of January 2025, which was two days after its launch. The token's value also surged to a peak market value of over $14.5 billion before plummeting by two-thirds. However, this rapid success came at the expense of small traders, many of whom incurred losses. At the time of writing, $TRUMP is currently trading at approximately $16 per $TRUMP/USD, indicating the massive decline this coin experienced after its peak. The reason for this significant decline is that the hype surrounding this meme coin has now dropped, and most investors are no longer dealing with FOMO. However, despite its decline, several analysts have provided varied predictions for $TRUMP's future price. Some forecasts have suggested that the coin could surpass the $100 mark by the end of 2025, while other analyses predict a rise to around $60 by March 9, 2025, indicating a potential increase of over 230%. With the hype around Donald Trump and his support for the crypto market, the Trump coin is clearly one of the most interesting coins of the year. The Meme Index - World’s First Decentralized Meme Coin Index The Meme Index is an innovative cryptocurrency that aggregates a selection of popular meme tokens into a single index. This unique project, which works similarly to an Exchange Traded Fund, allows investors to diversify their investments across various meme coins without having to manage multiple individual tokens.

This decentralized approach ensures that the indexes remain dynamic and reflective of current market trends.

Visit Catslap Key Factors to Consider When Investing in Cryptocurrencies The crypto market is a different ball game, and as such, you must take into consideration key factors before putting your money in cryptocurrencies; 1. Do Your Research Before investing in any cryptocurrency, first take your time to read about the crypto, its purpose, roadmap, and the team behind it. This is because, most times, you can tell when a cryptocurrency is going to be a good deal from its whitepaper and roadmap. 2. Check the Market Trends The cryptocurrency market can be volatile and the prices of cryptos can drop as quickly as they might have risen, so before investing in any crypto, first look at the historical data, recent trends, and market sentiment of the crypto. Also, join crypto forums and communities to understand what’s the sentiment and the public opinion regarding the desired crypto. 3. Growth Potential Each cryptocurrency has a different growth potential, so while some cryptos may have strong long-term potential, others may fade away quickly. So before you invest your money in any crypto, look at factors like supply and demand, upcoming developments, and how the project plans to grow. 4. Exchange Listings A coin being listed on major exchanges like Binance, ByBit, or Coinbase can boost its visibility and liquidity. Additionally, new listings often lead to price surges, so keep an eye on where a coin is available or might be listed soon. 5. Real-World Use Cases As we all know, a project with real utility is more likely to succeed. So, before you invest, think about whether the project solves a problem. Is it being adopted by businesses or industries? This is because, as we have seen with Ripple, Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana, etc, coins with real-world use cases tend to have stronger staying power. 6. Security Matters Also, make sure you store your crypto safely. Use secure wallets, enable two-factor authentication, and avoid keeping large amounts on exchanges. 7. Regulations and Risks It is important to know that crypto rules vary by country, and governments can change their stance. So before you invest, stay updated on your country's regulations and always be aware of potential risks. It is advised to check with every exchange if you can withdraw the funds to your bank account. 8. Long-Term vs. Short-Term Strategy Before you invest, first decide whether you’re investing for the long haul or planning to trade short-term, as this will help you determine the type of coins you choose and your risk tolerance. 9. Community and Adoption A strong and active community often means a project has real potential. So, before you invest, check the project’s social media, developer activity, and partnerships to see if people believe in it. Final Word To sum up, February 2025 is an exciting time for the cryptocurrency market. Following Donald Trump’s victory and the increasing optimism among investors and financial institutions, cryptocurrency prices are likely to continue their bullish trend. With Bitcoin leading the charge and new projects emerging across different sectors, there are plenty of opportunities for investors to explore. So, whether you're looking for long-term stability or short-term gains, the seven coins mentioned in this guide are all worth considering buying right now.

Recent market trends highlight a widening gap between the two, with altcoins facing significant pressure. A Widening Market Divide Bitcoin investors saw sharp price swings last week as it briefly plummeted to $91,300 before rebounding briefly to $102,000. The leading crypto asset has now settled near $96,000. This volatility stemmed from President Trump’s tariff threats against Canada, Mexico, and China, alongside a strong US dollar. Despite this short-term volatility, Glassnode found that the influx of liquidity into Bitcoin has surged, with significant capital flows helping to counterbalance the challenges of its expanding market. Furthermore, a more resilient and long-term-focused investor base has played an important role in maintaining Bitcoin’s price stability, even as broader macroeconomic conditions remain uncertain. The same cannot be said for the altcoin market, which has faced heavy selling pressure as many assets struggle with adoption and product-market fit. This challenging environment has led to a broad decline in token prices, with every altcoin sector underperforming Bitcoin in recent weeks. In fact, the altcoin market has lost $234 billion in value over the last two weeks, as per Glassnode’s data, with only a few instances of larger declines. This sharp drawdown indicates a major capitulation event that has reinforced the idea that the sector is still in a bear market, while Bitcoin’s current price trajectory is indicative of an emerging divide between BTC and other digital assets. In percentage terms, the altcoin drawdown remains notable, with only 41 out of 1,662 trading days seeing a larger decline. However, it aligns more closely with previous 2024 downturns and is less severe than the May 2021 Great Miner Migration, or the LUNA/UST and 3AC collapses in late 2022. Big Capitulation, But Still Within Norms During volatility over the week, around $520 million in losses were locked in as Bitcoin dropped to $93,000. Interestingly, this marked one of the largest capitulation events of this bull cycle – second only to the $1.3 billion loss back in August 2023. When measured in BTC terms to account for market size, the scale of these losses appears more “typical.” The magnitude is in line with previous capitulation events seen in 2024, which means that this remains within the expected range for a bull market correction or consolidation phase.

This optimistic outlook has fueled interest in a variety of digital currencies. In this article, we've compiled a list of the seven most promising cryptocurrencies to consider investing in this month and throughout the rest of 2025. Top Cryptocurrencies to Invest in for February 2025 - A Quick Overview Here’s a concise list of the leading cryptos to consider buying this February 2025: Mind of Pepe - Leading Crypto Presale AI Agent Bitcoin - Dominant Cryptocurrency by Market Cap Best Wallet Token - Comprehensive Non-Custodial 2025 Crypto Wallet Trump Coin - Meme Coin Initiated by President Donald Trump The Meme Index - First-Ever Decentralized Meme Coin Index Solaxy - First Solana Layer 2 Solution Catslap Token - Most Entertaining Meme Coin Detailed Reviews of the Best Cryptos to Buy in February 2025 In this part, we’ve thoroughly analyzed each of the top cryptocurrencies to consider this February to help you make informed investment choices. Here are the detailed reviews: Mind of Pepe - Premier Crypto Presale AI Agent MIND of Pepe ($MIND) stands out as an innovative cryptocurrency initiative that combines the power of artificial intelligence (AI) with meme culture. Its main feature is an advanced AI agent that collects valuable market insights from social media and shares these analyses with $MIND token holders. This AI tool is designed to give users an edge in the ever-evolving crypto space. Beyond its analytical capabilities, MIND of Pepe offers practical tools for its community. Its AI agent autonomously engages with influencers, platforms, and communities to provide real-time insights and encourage interaction. This adaptive system not only keeps users informed but also influences market trends, increasing the $MIND token's overall attractiveness and utility. In conclusion, Mind of Pepe seems poised to become one of the leading meme coins in 2025. https://youtu.be/5TK4Gau1_pc?si=OZMNy2oMhfE3LuBA Additionally, MIND of Pepe ensures that every token holder gains early market insights, not just the major players and insiders. Investors in the MIND of Pepe presale can benefit from the AI agent's capabilities to identify trends early and deliver this information promptly. Since its inception, the project has attracted considerable attention, raising over $5.7 million in its presale phase. Currently, $MIND is priced at $0.003305 per token, and with projections suggesting a 10x return, Mind of Pepe is undoubtedly one of the top cryptos to buy in February 2025. Visit Mind of Pepe Bitcoin - The Leading Cryptocurrency by Market Cap As the original and most renowned cryptocurrency, Bitcoin remains a pivotal asset in the digital currency market. Its decentralized structure and broad acceptance make it a key component of numerous investment strategies. Over time, Bitcoin has demonstrated remarkable durability and growth. Recently, Bitcoin's price has experienced notable volatility, affected by broader economic factors like impending inflation reports and the result of the US elections, with Trump's victory also playing a role. Many crypto experts suggest that unexpected inflation rates could influence Federal Reserve policies, potentially impacting Bitcoin's attractiveness to investors. Analysts have also warned that if Bitcoin's value dips below the $92,000 support level, it might decline further to around $80,000. However, some remain hopeful about its long-term prospects, especially given the rising interest from institutional investors. Currently, Bitcoin is valued at $98,000 per BTC/USD, and its TD sequential indicator has signaled a buying opportunity, suggesting the bullish trend could persist. Predictions indicate BTC might reach $150,000 by mid-year and potentially $185,000 by the year's end. For those thinking long-term, Bitcoin's established history of expansion, its limited supply, and robust network make it a solid investment option. Best Wallet Token - Fully Non-Custodial Crypto Wallet for 2025 Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the native digital currency of the Best Wallet platform, a non-custodial crypto wallet supporting over 60 blockchains. This wallet is user-friendly and entirely non-custodial, accommodating thousands of major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, and many others. Owning $BEST tokens provides several advantages within the Best Wallet ecosystem. Some benefits include reduced transaction fees, early access to new projects, increased staking rewards, and involvement in community governance. These incentives are designed to boost user engagement and add value for token holders. The Best Wallet ecosystem also features a decentralized exchange (Best DEX) and the forthcoming Best Card, a crypto debit card enabling users to spend their digital assets in real-world transactions. The Best Card will offer cashback on purchases and lower transaction fees for those holding and staking $BEST tokens. Given its myriad features and unique wallet ecosystem, it's unsurprising that many analysts predict $BEST could become the next 100x crypto asset. https://youtu.be/lGZrb_MzQM4?si=K1phtUyeP7PbafLc The $BEST token is currently available in its presale phase, priced at $0.02395 per token. The presale has successfully raised over $9.5 million, reflecting growing excitement about this token in the crypto community. Investors interested in this project should follow Best Wallet on X , Discord , and Telegram for the latest updates, and visit the official Best Wallet token presale page below. Visit Best Wallet Token Presale Trump Coin - Meme Coin Introduced by President Donald Trump Trump Coin, a meme-inspired cryptocurrency launched on January 17, 2025, reportedly by the 47th U.S. President Donald Trump, has attracted considerable attention. In just under two weeks post-launch, the $TRUMP project generated nearly $100 million in trading fees. The $TRUMP token reached its peak shortly after its debut, hitting an all-time high of $77.24 on January 19, 2025, just two days after launching. Its market value also peaked at over $14.5 billion before declining by two-thirds. Unfortunately, this rapid rise came at a cost to smaller investors, many of whom faced losses. Currently, $TRUMP is trading at about $16 per $TRUMP/USD, highlighting the significant drop since its peak. This decline is largely due to the waning excitement surrounding the coin, with fewer investors experiencing FOMO. Despite its downturn, various analysts have made different forecasts for $TRUMP's future valuation. Some predictions suggest the coin might surpass $100 by the end of 2025, while others anticipate a rise to approximately $60 by March 9, 2025, suggesting a potential uptick of over 230%. Given the ongoing buzz around Donald Trump and his enthusiasm for the crypto sector, Trump Coin remains one of the year's most intriguing tokens. The Meme Index - First Decentralized Meme Coin Index Worldwide The Meme Index is a pioneering cryptocurrency that consolidates several popular meme tokens into one index. Functioning similarly to an Exchange Traded Fund, this project enables investors to diversify their holdings across various meme coins without managing multiple individual tokens. Essentially, it acts as a basket of different meme coins. Technically, the Meme Index ($MEMEX) is a decentralized platform offering investors organized access to the meme coin market, valued at over $120 billion. By holding $MEMEX tokens, investors can engage in four different indexes: Titan, Moonshot, MidCap, and Frenzy, each representing varying market capitalization levels and associated risks. https://youtu.be/DzO9o65b9Lg?si=ftkkBm51dB5yNxGV Moreover, the platform emphasizes community involvement, granting $MEMEX token holders governance rights to suggest and vote on which meme coins are included in each index. This decentralized approach ensures the indexes remain dynamic and in line with current market trends. Additionally, the platform provides staking opportunities, allowing users to earn passive income by locking their tokens within the ecosystem. Overall, as meme coins continue to gain massive attention, the Meme Index positions itself as one of the best cryptocurrencies to purchase at the moment. Visit Meme Index Solaxy - First Solana Layer 2 Scaling Solution Another promising cryptocurrency to consider is Solaxy ($SOLX) , an innovative Layer 2 solution aimed at enhancing the Solana blockchain's capabilities by tackling its scalability issues. By conducting transactions off-chain and then bundling them for settlement on the main net, Solaxy seeks to mitigate network congestion, lower transaction costs, and boost transaction speeds. This Layer 2 solution aims to improve the efficiency and user experience of decentralized applications (dApps) within the Solana ecosystem. Additionally, the project has attracted considerable interest from investors hopeful about Solaxy's ability to overcome current network constraints. To date, the $SOLX presale has raised over $19.6 million, with each $SOLX token priced at $0.001632. Analysts have forecasted significant gains for the $SOLX token by the end of 2025, with further growth anticipated in the coming years. https://youtu.be/bHNaKHJVFsA?si=VZsrTzEKVFdw6wCf Those interested in this project can follow Solaxy on X and Telegram for the latest updates, and visit the official presale page below. Visit Solaxy Catslap Token - The Most Entertaining Crypto Meme Coin Catslap Token ($SLAP) is a cat-themed meme coin aiming to surpass the top frog and dog-inspired meme coins. Built on the Ethereum network, this meme coin introduces an engaging ""Slap-2-Earn"" game, where players can partake in virtual slapping to earn points and climb global leaderboards. This gamified strategy is intended to boost community engagement and distinguish it from other meme coins. The meme coin's total supply is 9 billion SLAP tokens, with distribution as follows: 50% for liquidity, 20% for staking rewards, 10% for community rewards, 10% for the development fund, and 10% reserved for the team, which will be vested over ten years. This setup is designed to ensure long-term project sustainability and encourage active community participation. Currently, $SLAP is trading at approximately $0.0011, with a market capitalization of around $4.7 million and an average daily trading volume of roughly $72M. The token is listed on various exchanges, including MEXC, where the SLAP/USDT pair is actively traded. Visit Catslap Crucial Considerations When Investing in Cryptocurrencies Investing in cryptocurrencies is a unique endeavor, and there are essential factors to consider before making any investment: 1. Conduct Thorough Research Before investing in any cryptocurrency, take the time to understand its purpose, roadmap, and the team behind it. Often, a cryptocurrency's whitepaper and roadmap can indicate its potential for success. 2. Analyze Market Trends The crypto market is volatile, with prices rising and falling rapidly. Before investing, examine the historical data, current trends, and market sentiment of the cryptocurrency. Join crypto forums and communities to gauge public opinion and sentiment regarding the desired cryptocurrency. 3. Evaluate Growth Potential Cryptocurrencies vary in growth potential; some may offer long-term promise, while others may not last. Consider factors such as supply and demand, forthcoming developments, and the project's growth strategy before investing. 4. Monitor Exchange Listings Being listed on major exchanges like Binance, ByBit, or Coinbase can enhance a coin's visibility and liquidity. New listings often lead to price increases, so be aware of where a coin is listed or might be listed soon. 5. Look for Real-World Applications A project with tangible utility is more likely to succeed. Before investing, consider whether the project addresses a real problem. Is it gaining adoption by businesses or industries? Coins like Ripple, Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Solana, which have real-world applications, tend to have greater longevity. 6. Prioritize Security Ensure your crypto assets are stored securely. Use secure wallets, enable two-factor authentication, and avoid holding large sums on exchanges. 7. Acknowledge Regulations and Risks Cryptocurrency regulations differ by country, and policies can change. Stay informed about your country's regulations and potential risks before investing. Verify each exchange's policies regarding fund withdrawals to bank accounts. 8. Decide on a Long-Term vs. Short-Term Strategy Determine whether you're investing for the long term or planning short-term trades, as this will influence your choice of coins and risk tolerance. 9. Assess Community and Adoption A strong and engaged community often indicates a project with real potential. Before investing, check the project's social media, developer activity, and partnerships to see if it has widespread support. Final Thoughts In conclusion, February 2025 presents an exciting period for the cryptocurrency market. With Donald Trump’s electoral victory and rising optimism among investors and financial institutions, cryptocurrency prices are likely to maintain their upward trend. As Bitcoin leads the charge and new projects emerge across various sectors, investors have numerous opportunities to explore. Whether you're seeking long-term stability or short-term gains, the seven coins highlighted in this guide are worth considering for your portfolio.

At that time, the fall in market prices was followed by a historic altcoin rally in Q1-Q2 of 2021. Several new cryptos surged to unprecedented highs and returned substantial profits. If this momentum and the 4-year cycle theory still hold, this recent price dip may set the stage for another outstanding bull run. Some new cryptos are poised to go full nuclear. Rollblock and Pepe are making the rounds for their rich fundamentals and immense price growth potential. Rollblock, in particular, is set to take the front stage as its successful presale generated above $10.3 million, highlighting strong investors’ confidence. Read on to learn why these new cryptos are the favorites in the upcoming bull run. Rollblock: The GambleFi protocol is gaining traction While Pepe dominates meme culture, Rollblock (RBLK) makes a name for itself by transforming online gambling and betting through blockchain technology. As the pioneer of GambleFi, Rollblock has introduced a decentralized, transparent, and revenue-sharing model that is disrupting the $540 billion online casino industry. Its true prospects lie in leveraging blockchain technology to ensure fair play and transparency, removing any possibility of bet manipulation. This is one of the reasons why the Rollblock crypto casino has experienced rapid growth, with over 45,000 active users engaging with the platform daily. The platform offers over 7,000 games, including timeless favorites like blackjack and roulette, live dealer games, and new experiences like AI-powered exclusives to entice punters further. Another feature that struck a chord with investors is Rollblock’s unique revenue-sharing mechanism. Under this system, the platform uses up to 30% of its revenue to purchase $RBLK tokens from the open market, with proceeds split between staking rewards and token burns. This mechanism allows new cryptos like RBLK to provide passive income for their holders while driving up scarcity, leading to potentially increased value over time. PEPE: The frog-themed ERC20 token PEPE started as a deflationary meme coin and tribute to internet sensation PEPE: The Frog. However, PEPE went far beyond an ordinary tribute to an integral part of meme culture. The token's buildup on PEPE: The Frog's legacy clearly paid off, and the meme coin even attracted loads of institutional interest. Last quarter, Coinbase and Robinhood listed PEPE - a move that saw it surge to a new ATH of $0.000028 and its market cap rise as high as $11.1 billion. While PEPE's price has been under the weather, its community-driven approach and growing popularity could fuel its resurgence back into the spotlight this year. Positive crypto market news, like the crypto-friendly regulatory shift under US President Donald Trump, is also expected to bolster momentum for altcoins like PEPE. Conclusion Following the latest crypto market news, PEPE and Rollblock continue to gain traction for their high growth prospects in 2025 and beyond. While PEPE instills confidence, Rollblock is currently at the forefront of pioneering a GambleFi approach, which could turn in significant gains for its early investors. The Rollblock presale has entered Stage 10, with tokens priced at just $0.053. Early investors have already seen gains of over 420% and analysts predict a further 800% increase before the presale concludes.

Back then, a decline in market prices was succeeded by a historic rally of altcoins during the first and second quarters of 2021.

If the momentum and the 4-year cycle theory remain valid, the latest drop in prices might pave the way for another remarkable bull market.

Rollblock: The Rise of GambleFi Protocol While Pepe dominates the meme space, Rollblock (RBLK) is carving out its niche by revolutionizing online gambling and betting with blockchain. As a pioneer in the GambleFi sector, Rollblock has introduced a decentralized, transparent, and revenue-sharing model that is shaking up the $540 billion online casino industry. The true potential of Rollblock lies in utilizing blockchain technology to guarantee fair play and transparency, eliminating the risk of manipulation.

Building on the legacy of PEPE: The Frog, the token has successfully attracted considerable institutional interest. In the last quarter, PEPE was listed on Coinbase and Robinhood, propelling it to a new all-time high of $0.000028 and raising its market cap to $11.1 billion.

Favorable crypto market developments, such as a crypto-friendly regulatory environment under US President Donald Trump, are also expected to boost altcoins like PEPE.

During its existence it developed a comprehensive framework that comprises DeFi protocols and NFT marketplaces and layer-2 scaling solutions. However in recent times, the technological developments of ETH fail to satisfy investors because of its disappointing Ethereum price movements. The Ethereum price currently stands at $2,642.12 and shows a 17% decrease in value throughout the month. However, an AI presale rival has managed to raise over $8.5 million in just 30 days. Hailed as the “Next ETH”, this platform could be the start of a financial revolution. IntelMarkets (INTL): The AI Crypto That’s Capturing Investor Attention IntelMarkets (INTL) uses AI technology to build a DeFi platform to improve crypto trading capabilities. The AI capabilities of IntelMarkets function as the primary element that gives this platform better performance capabilities than Ethereum. Users accessing IntelMarkets avoid traditional crypto trading complexities because self-learning trading robots study past data alongside present conditions to make profitable trades. The platform enables automatic trading operations, which enables users to achieve better returns while minimizing their risk exposure, thus attracting traders who wish to succeed in the crypto market volatility. IntelMarkets has gained focus because of its low market capitalization combined with its early development opportunities, while its trading robots driven by AI technologies drive major interest. Analysts claim that IntelMarkets presents an extraordinary growth opportunity because of the low entry price of $0.08 for INTL tokens . Early investors who participated in the presale obtained significant returns by contributing $8.5 million. IntelMarkets gained serious standing in the AI blockchain sector because of its technological leadership combined with strong community support. Why Ethereum’s Price Growth Has Stagnated The crypto community has always considered Ethereum (ETH) to be a top blockchain platform for building smart contracts and decentralized applications. However, investors have expressed doubts because ETH maintains its scalability framework through layer-2 solutions and declining Ethereum prices. The competition from Solana and Avalanche proves significant, offering quicker transaction speeds and lower gas fees. Expert analysts predicted the Ethereum price would reach $10,000, but the market has not reflected this optimism through its price action. The recent US-China trade war has caused fear in the crypto market, with many tokens experiencing a severe correction. During previous market cycles ETH obtained its value mainly through DeFi technologies and NFT innovations. Ethereum faces strong competition from AI blockchain developments since it lacks a well-defined role in this emerging industry. The investing community together with institutional investors now put their money into promising AI-driven cryptocurrency projects. Conclusion: The Best Crypto Investment in 2025? While Ethereum's price declines, ETH maintains its status as a foundational cryptocurrency in the market. However, its current market performance, combined with underlying technical constraints, causes investors to seek more promising investment options. The revolutionary IntelMarkets (INTL) trading platform operates through AI technology to launch a future-centric crypto ecosystem based on decentralized banking and automated analytics and trading features. IntelMarkets emerges as the ideal substitute for Ethereum for investors who want elevated returns since it entered early into the market with solid funding and demonstrates potential for 75x growth after its initial launch. The rapid growth of INTL reaches new heights while the Ethereum price encounters obstacles that prevent it from breaking through important resistance points.

The number of hacking incidents rose from 282 in 2023 to 303 over the same period, reflecting an ongoing challenge for the industry in preventing and addressing security breaches. WhiteBIT cryptocurrency exchange announced today that it has successfully secured over $150 million in at-risk cryptocurrency funds in 2024, further solidifying WhiteBIT’s role as a key partner in the fight against digital crime. High-Profile Recoveries WhiteBIT’s efforts have been central to resolving several significant cases involving stolen crypto assets. As a result of these efforts, the company has safeguarded $4.8 million in stolen funds. The exchange successfully secured funds tied to XRP in an investigation involving Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen. In response to the Coinspaid breach , WhiteBIT froze significant amounts of cryptocurrency, helping to mitigate losses for the affected users. Additionally, the exchange acted swiftly during the TAO Holder case, identified by blockchain investigator ZachXBT, blocking a large sum of USDC and supporting law enforcement efforts in their recovery process. In April, cryptocurrency exchange Rain.com fell victim to a $16 million hack orchestrated by the North Korean hacking group Lazarus. Investigators collaborating with the FBI traced $760,000 in stolen SOL to WhiteBIT. In September, WhiteBIT had successfully returned the funds to the FBI pursuant to a Court Order, further aiding in the recovery process. Anti-Money Laundering Practices WhiteBIT is dedicated to collaborating with law enforcement agencies globally to enhance security and protect users from fraudulent activities. The team places a strong emphasis on transparency and streamlined communication, ensuring that law enforcement can easily connect when needed. “Our approach goes beyond standard AML practices,” stated a representative from WhiteBIT’s Compliance department. “We leverage OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) to uncover suspicious activities meticulously, utilize custom-built monitoring systems to detect and halt fraudulent transactions, and conduct manual investigations to ensure detailed and accurate assessments of flagged cases.” Insights on Cybercrime in 2024 According to experts from WhiteBIT’s Compliance Department, the most common types of incidents on the exchange are as follows: Hacking of wallets through technical means—such as phishing, viruses, keyloggers, and direct hacking—accounts for 40% of the incidents on the exchange; Social engineering scams: Another 40% is attributed to scams involving promises of easy investment returns, often disguised as legitimate opportunities. They typically involve sophisticated tactics, including fake websites and multiple individuals interacting with victims to build trust; Scrolling scams: 10% of victims are lured through crypto-related Telegram channels. Initially, they make small profits, which leads to repeated investments, but eventually, the scammers disappear with the funds; The remaining 10% of incidents involve fake versions of the WhiteBIT website and compromised accounts. WhiteBIT’s Compliance department representative explains: “Weak passwords and lack of two-factor authentication (2FA) significantly increase the risk of compromising the accounts. At WhiteBIT, we mitigate these risks by storing 96% of funds in cold wallets, enforcing 2FA, and securing private keys with advanced encryption protocols.” Security Standards WhiteBIT is ranked among the top 5 most secure crypto exchanges globally by CER.live and is the first crypto exchange to achieve the CCSS Level 3 certification—the highest securitystandard in the crypto industry at the moment. This distinction underscores the exchange’s proactive efforts to safeguard users and assets against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. WhiteBIT remains at the forefront of crypto security, combining innovation, compliance, and swift action to tackle emerging threats. In a year marked by record-breaking crypto crime, WhiteBIT’s efforts have not only safeguarded millions but also set a benchmark for the entire industry.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As XRP stalls and SHIB sees a slowdown, Remittix is gaining attention for its cross-border payment solutions and projected growth in 2025. Table of Contents XRP drops despite ETF hype Shiba Inu burn rate drops 60% Why investors are choosing Remittix Remittix is getting ready for a good run in 2025. Ripple and Shiba Inu have always been favorites for many. XRP is ready to break new pricing restrictions, while SHIB assures big returns motivated by its strong community. Many, however, are wondering if RTX’s current performance as well as the projections of a climb to $3 make it a better investment for 2025. Read on to discover more about the RTX token and the reasons it is among the leading crypto coins available right now. XRP drops despite ETF hype Though the whole crypto market is showing a good trend, the XRP price has not surged high. XRP seems to have developed a barrier and lacks the momentum to be broken through. Many investors are now wary as the absence of price movement makes one unsure about its future. Still, the XRP community is seeing many encouraging changes right now. Based on prior patterns, crypto market researcher EGRAG CRYPTO on X suggested XRP would plunge drastically before recovering. XRP surged 230% in July 2023, he observed. Two significant declines of 54.65% and 59.73%, then followed this surge. This has generated great purchasing prospects. Shiba Inu burn rate drops 60% Shiba Inu’s burn rate has fallen 60.59% throughout the past 24 hours which begs questions regarding its deflationary influence. Notwithstanding this temporary drop, the weekly burn rate has climbed over 3,500%, suggesting ongoing community efforts to lower supplies. Technical indicators, however, point to a bearish flag pattern, which, should the trend continue down, would cause more price declines. At press time, SHIB is trading at $0.00001644. With a relative strength index (RSI) of 36.53, near the oversold zone, the index indicates likely stabilization while maintaining bearish momentum intact. Comparably, the MACD stays negative, thereby supporting selling pressure. Positively, if SHIB breaks out, a contracting triangle pattern is developing and experts are looking at resistance at $0.00001688, $0.000017549, and $0.000018966. You might also like: Litecoin may see ETFs before Solana; Remittix tipped to disrupt payments market Why investors are choosing Remittix Combining blockchain technology with currency transfers transforms global payments, and Remittix (RTX) offers fast and competitively priced cross-border solutions. Supported by more than forty cryptocurrencies like Cardano, Shiba Inu, Dogecoin and Ethereum, the platform provides fast translations into fiat currencies like USD and GBP, therefore enabling perfect bank account deposits. Remittix guarantees accessibility and inclusivity for businesses and individuals by supporting over 50 crypto pairs and more than 30 fiat currencies, simplifying world trade with its wide range of possibilities. Remittix is the better alternative to conventional payment companies like Stripe and Wise as a link between crypto and fiat. Furthermore remarkable is the platform’s open flat-fee approach, which offers savings and transparency over excessive rates of exchange of conventional banks. In the payments industry, Remittix is revolutionary since this approach guarantees that the whole amount transferred reaches the recipient, therefore addressing unethical activity all too often. With a pre-sale price of $0.0567, the RTX coin shows great investment potential. Forecasts suggest considerable rise; demand for unique cross-border payment solutions is generating a 25x multiplier in the presale phase and over 1,500% growth following launch. Beyond their common emphasis on cross-border payments, XRP and Remittix’s ability to question established financial institutions and provide actual answers calls for comparison. While Remittix is developing with its inclusive approach and first-rate technologies, XRP has shown the value of blockchain in worldwide banking. With increasing acceptance, a sound basis and a clear market need, RTX might not only equal XRP’s success but also redefine the benchmarks for blockchain-based financial solutions.

Following its Coinbase and Robinhood listing, analysts believe it still has some runs left in the market. However, whatever bullish runs the PEPE price still has in its feet, its potential gains could pale compared to this new crypto: Rollblock. RBLK has captured the interest of thousands of players and investors with its innovative approach to GambleFi. This Rollblock momentum has driven its generated funds past $10.3 million from over 45,000 early investors, setting a new market benchmark. Recent on-chain indicators show that ETH whales are now taking notice, with many already buying into the project. This text explores Rollblock's potential to outperform in the market. Rollblock attracts ETH whales with its revolutionary GambleFi protocol ETH whales are always on the lookout for projects that will rival Ethereum in terms of gains. Rollblock is shining to these whales and sending a clear signal to the public of its 100x potential. These ETH whales believe Rollblock's upcoming bull run will replicate the 2024 PEPE price surge and deliver significant gains to its holders. Behind these predictions are Rollblock's strong fundamentals, which have positioned it as a utility token with high growth prospects. Rollblock's crypto casino is committed to offering a secure, reliable, and transparent online gaming experience, unlike traditional gambling platforms. Additionally, Rollblock offers staking rewards with up to 30% APYs through its revenue-sharing model if the huge payouts as in-game rewards aren't enough. PEPE price drops 30% amid hopes of a resurgence Late last year, PEPE impressed the crypto market with its 160% price surge, which edged most PEPE holders in green. However, even PEPE could not escape the general price downturn that affected the crypto market since the beginning of the year. Currently trading at $0.000009, the PEPE price fell by over 30% from last month. The recent correction in the frog-based meme coin liquidated over $20 million worth of trading funds. On the bright side, the on-chain metrics show strength as PEPE's funding rates are slowly rising, signaling investors' hopes of a resurgence. Before this positive market sentiment takes over, PEPE will have to break through key resistance levels. The Ethereum price slipes amid competition and weak demand Data from Coinmarketcap shows that the Ethereum price continues to decline, slumping over 20% for the second time in 2025. With key psychological price zones weakening, analysts are increasingly concerned about a potential fall to $1,200. Even more depressing is that ETH whales have started moving their holdings to several alternatives, further plunging the price. Ethereum's futures market provides additional insights into its ongoing price struggles. Since the latest downturn, Ethereum Funding rates, which measure sentiment among ETH traders, have dropped significantly. RBLK to outperform the PEPE price as ETH whales pile in With the PEPE price experiencing a bearish phase, many investors are looking for new ways to boost their portfolios. Rollblock is rapidly becoming a fan favorite to do so, with experts predicting a massive 100x price multiplier in the coming months. The Rollblock presale offers an ideal entry point at 0.053.

Bitcoin price dropped to $96,000, while the market cap of all coins fell to $3.15 trillion. So, let’s explore what happened in the crypto industry in the last 24 hours. Crypto Prices Trump World Liberty Finance Launches Strategic Token Reserve World Liberty Finance, the crypto project associated with Donald Trump, launched a strategic token reserve as it takes advantage of the growing industry. Arkham data shows that the network has already invested in tokens like Tron, Ethereum, Chainlink, Ondo, and AAVE. Trump Meda, the parent company of TruthSocial, has also hinted that it will get more into the crypto industry. It has already applied to trademark investment products that track Bitcoin and other assets. Trump Hires Brian Quintenz to Lead CFTC Crypto Division Another notable crypto story was that Donald Trump hired Brian Quintenz to be the crypto head at the CFTC. This is notable since Quintenz is the current head of a16z, the venture capital firm run by Andressen Horowitz. He has led investments in tens of crypto projects like Alchemy Pay, Coinbase, Aptos, Avalanche, Arweave, and Dfinity, the parent of Internet Computer. Trump has also appointed other pro-crypto executives like Paul Atkins to lead the SEC and David Sacks as the AI and crypto czar. Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF See Outflows The other key crypto news was that spot, and Bitcoin ETFs had outflows for the second straight day. All Bitcoin ETFs had outflows of $56 million on Tuesday, a day after shedding $186 million. These funds now have cumulative inflows of $40 billion. Spot Ethereum ETF inflows rose by $12.58 million, bringing the total inflows to about $3.17 billion. All these funds have over $9.8 billion in assets. That is a sign that Wall Street is largely interested in Bitcoin funds. Goldman Sachs Buys Crypto ETFs Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs, the giant Wall Street company, remains upbeat on cryptocurrencies. It boosted its investment in spot Bitcoin ETFs to $1.5 billion and its ETH ETFs by $22 million to $476 million. This is a sign that the company believes that these coins will continue doing well in the long term. The other top Wall Street companies that have invested in these coins are Susquehanna, Fidelity, Citadel, and Jane Street. US Inflation Data and Powell Statement Bitcoin and other crypto coins may have volatility when the US publishes the January inflation report. A softer-than-expected headline and core inflation figure will push them higher since they will point to a more dovish Fed. Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, will also testify before a House committee. In his Senate meeting, he noted that the bank was not in a hurry to slash interest rates since inflation is still high.

Can It Bounce Back from its 30-Day Lows?,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/toncoin-price-struggles-can-it-bounce-back-from-its-30-day-lows/,"The post Toncoin Price Struggles! Can It Bounce Back from its 30-Day Lows? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Amid the ongoing market turmoil, the Toncoin price has continued to lose value this year. This indicates a strong bearish sentiment for the altcoin in the crypto space. Further, with consolidated price action, this altcoin has repeatedly failed to reclaim the $4 mark. If the market continues favoring the bears this month, will the Ton price achieve a new 52-week low soon? In this article, we have covered the possible short-term “Toncoin Price Analysis” just for you. TON Price Records A Consolidated Price Action! The price of Toncoin has dropped by 3.23% in 24 hours with a trading volume of $127.78 million. Moreover, it has plunged 28.33% over the past month and has a Year-to-Date (YTD) return of -32.43%. With a market cap of $9.275 billion, it has secured the 16th position. TradingView: TON/USDT The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is on the path of experiencing a bullish crossover in its averages with its histogram displaying a similar price action. This suggests an increase in the positive outlook for the altcoin this week. Moreover, the SMA indicator records a similar price trend in the daily time frame. This highlights that the 16th largest crypto token may continue gaining value in the upcoming time. Will Toncoin Price Hit $5? If the Toncoin price regains bullish sentiment, this could push its value toward its resistance level of $4.035. Maintaining the price above that level could set the stage for it to head toward its upper high of $6.415 in the coming time. Conversely, if the bears outrun the bulls, this altcoin may retest its immediate support level of $2.960. Furthermore, if the bears dominate the crypto space, this could pull the price toward its lower support trendline of $2 in the coming weeks.

Bitcoin (BTC) lost 1.3%, while majors ether (ETH), Solana’s SOL, Cardano’s ADA and XRP lost as much as 3%. Memecoin dogecoin (DOGE) slid the most with a 4.5% slide, while BNB Chain’s BNB was up 1% amid renewed interest in the blockchain's ecosystem. The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20) , a liquid index tracking the largest tokens by market cap, fell 2.5%. The U.S. CPI measures the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. Changes in CPI readings tend to impact bitcoin, and the broader crypto market, as investors view the asset class as a hedge against inflation. The outlook for the January CPI calls for a monthly increase of 0.3% for the all-items index and a 12-month inflation rate of 2.9%, providing cues on whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in 2025 to battle rising prices. Some traders expect a dollar unwind on any indications of a rate cut — which could bump risk assets and provide an entry for crypto investors looking to bet on higher prices. “We infer that the market is heavily long on the dollar. Given that negative news has likely been priced in, we believe USD now faces greater downside risk,” Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a Telegram broadcast on Wednesday. “Any positive news could force USD longs to unwind their positions en masse, potentially sending risk assets higher. Tonight’s CPI release could be the catalyst that triggers a sharp move lower in DXY.” “However, this rising tide may not lift all boats. Bitcoin continues to underperform equities and gold, suggesting some hesitation within the crypto community. Liquidity remains thin across the numerous new listings each week, and last week’s large-scale liquidation wiped out many traders,” QCP said, referring to last Monday’s $1 billion liquidation event QCP added purchasing “downside protection” — or options that pay out as prices fall lower — continue to be the “best strategy” in the current environment.",Markets|Bitcoin|Dogecoin|Inflation,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|DOGE|FIAT|ADA,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-12 12:19:59

Analysts Weigh In on Pepe Unchained, Wall Street Pepe, and Pepeto’s Market Impact",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/02/next-100x-meme-coin-analysts-weigh-in-on-pepe-unchained-wall-street-pepe-and-pepetos-market-impact,"The rising popularity of frog-themed cryptocurrency projects is quickly becoming one of the hottest trends in the market. With Pepe Unchained successfully listed, Wall Street Pepe’s presale selling out, and Pepeto’s presale gaining attention, these projects are attracting investors who see them as potential breakout opportunities. This wave of excitement mirrors the previous bull market when dog-themed tokens dominated the meme coin scene. Now, with Trump’s political comeback and Elon Musk teasing a frog-themed rally with a recent update to his X profile, the frog coin trend is gaining even more momentum Pepe Unchained: A Layer 2 Success Story Pepe Unchained, which launched in late December 2024, took advantage of Layer 2 scalability and efficient transactions, quickly gaining a 10x increase after listing. By focusing on speed, security, and cost reduction, it has positioned itself as a strong player in the meme coin space, proving that Layer 2 solutions can add real value to the crypto market. Wall Street Pepe: Trading Community Preps for Launch After its presale sold out, Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) is set to officially launch in February 2025. The project stands out for its focus on trading, aiming to unite retail investors into a coordinated community that identifies profitable opportunities. Given Pepe Unchained’s success with its Layer 2 model, Wall Street Pepe could see a similar surge in price post-listing, especially with its unique focus on trading intelligence and market influence. Pepeto: A Presale with High Potential and Low Entry Unlike Pepe Unchained and Wall Street Pepe, which have completed their presales, Pepeto ($PEPETO) is still in presale and offers an entry price of just $0.000000110 per token. Pepeto stands out not only due to its affordable price but also because of its intriguing narrative, advanced technology, and growing speculation surrounding its origins. Why Pepeto is Different Exclusive Exchange Access: Holders will have the chance to list tokens directly on Pepeto Exchange, a significant advantage in the meme coin market. Next-Gen Bridge Technology: The PepetoSwap bridge allows for seamless cross-chain transactions, increasing crypto adoption and improving interoperability between blockchains. The Pepeto Story: A Betrayal That Sparked a Revolution The backstory of Pepeto reveals that Pepe wasn’t the original creator—he took important documents from Pepeto, thinking he had everything needed to create the ultimate meme coin. However, he missed two key elements: ""T"" for Technology and ""O"" for Optimization. Without these, Pepe’s version was incomplete, while Pepeto kept the true blueprint for long-term success. This story has fueled rumors that a former Pepe founder may be behind Pepeto, especially since both projects share the same 420T token supply. Regardless of whether this is true, the speculation has added to the growing buzz around Pepeto. Pepeto’s Rapid Growth Pepeto’s social media presence has skyrocketed in recent weeks, with a rapidly growing community across major platforms: - Instagram: 31.3K+ followers - X (Twitter): 18.1K+ followers - Telegram: 30.8K+ members With frog-themed meme coins gaining more attention, Pepeto stands out as a low-cost, high-potential project in its final presale stage. The real question now is whether it will follow the success of its predecessors or surpass them entirely.
