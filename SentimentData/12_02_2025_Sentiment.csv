Unlike tokens relying purely on market speculation, MUTM offers decentralized lending and borrowing features within a structured ecosystem. This framework incorporates peer-to-peer lending, a stablecoin pegged to on-chain collateral, and a buy-and-distribute system intended to promote steady token value over time. Currently available in its initial presale phase at $0.01, MUTM provides early adopters an opportunity to acquire tokens before a series of 11 presale stages lifts the price to $0.06 at launch. Many analysts anticipate a significant uptick in MUTM’s valuation once the token is listed, pointing to it as an undervalued project that could eventually rival XRP and Solana. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Stands Out Mutuum Finance is set to make a lasting mark in decentralized finance by prioritizing real-world functionality rather than speculative hype. Through the platform, users can either generate passive returns by lending assets or secure crypto-backed loans without liquidating their holdings. Two lending models—Peer-to-Contract (P2C) for automated terms and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) for direct negotiations—ensure diverse and adaptable borrowing options. Central to Mutuum Finance’s roadmap is its planned stablecoin, fully backed by collateral and deployed on Ethereum. This stablecoin aims to broaden lending possibilities while minimizing volatility. In contrast to protocols reliant on off-chain reserves, Mutuum Finance provides transparent minting via deposited collateral. With security at the forefront, all smart contracts will undergo audits by an established firm. During this first presale stage, tokens are priced at $0.01, climbing up to $0.06 by the final round. Over 7 million tokens have already been sold, raising more than $70,000 from investors eager to lock in these discounted rates. To help stabilize MUTM’s value and mitigate extreme price swings, the project has implemented a buy-and-distribute mechanic. A portion of fees collected from lending and borrowing is used to purchase MUTM tokens on the open market, which are then distributed to mtToken stakers. This approach not only encourages long-term holding but also applies regular buy pressure on the token, potentially leading to a steadier price trajectory after launch. Mutuum Finance’s beta platform is slated to go live alongside its listing on exchanges, allowing token holders to immediately engage with the lending and borrowing services. This eliminates much of the uncertainty that accompanies pre-product launches in the crypto space and fosters a sense of reliability among investors. Additionally, Mutuum Finance is hosting a $100,000 giveaway for early participants, with ten winners each receiving $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. Interested users can enter by following the project’s official channels and performing specific tasks. On Track to Rival Established Projects With an actionable roadmap, a rapidly growing community, and tangible DeFi use cases, Mutuum Finance offers a compelling alternative to more established tokens like XRP and Solana. As its presale continues to gather momentum, the project’s utility-focused design and built-in mechanisms for sustaining price stability position MUTM as an undervalued opportunity well worth considering. Early adopters who secure tokens now could potentially see significant returns as the platform moves closer to its full-scale launch.

This impressive rally has positioned Litecoin as one of the top-performing altcoins during a period of market uncertainty. Analysts and investors are now speculating about the potential for a massive breakout in the coming weeks as Litecoin continues to show relative strength compared to other cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Cardano Is Showing Signs Of A Potential Rebound As Key Indicator Flashes A Buy Signal – Analyst Top analyst BigCheds shared a detailed technical analysis, revealing that Litecoin is approaching daily range peaks and gearing up to test multi-year highs around the $145 mark. This key resistance level has been a critical zone for Litecoin in previous cycles, and breaking above it could signal the start of a significant upward trend. Litecoin’s recent momentum has caught the attention of both retail and institutional investors, who are watching closely for signs of a confirmed breakout. With the broader market still consolidating, Litecoin’s ability to outperform could set the stage for a bullish continuation, potentially taking the price to new heights. As the crypto market braces for its next move, Litecoin’s price action remains a focal point for traders. Breaking past the $145 level would solidify its bullish narrative and pave the way for further gains. Litecoin Prepares For A Breakout Litecoin has shown impressive relative strength, surging over 30% in the past week, while the broader market continues to face indecision. This notable performance has captured the attention of analysts and investors, with some expecting Litecoin to lead a bullish rally that could break multi-year highs and push into higher supply levels. However, caution remains among market experts, as the current price action could result in a fake breakout. Top analyst BigCheds shared a technical analysis on X, revealing that Litecoin is approaching daily range peaks. According to him, the key level to watch is around $145, a critical resistance zone that has acted as a barrier in the past. BigCheds stated that while the price momentum is promising, he remains skeptical until Litecoin can decisively clear this level and hold it as support. The next few days will be crucial for Litecoin as altcoins across the market are finding support, and Bitcoin flirts with reclaiming the $100K mark. If Litecoin can sustain its momentum and break above the $145 level, it could solidify its position as one of the leading altcoins in the current market cycle. Conversely, failing to clear this key level could lead to a retracement, testing lower support zones. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Multi-Year Bullish Pattern – Expert Suggests The Next Move Will Be ‘The Real Deal’ As the market watches closely, Litecoin’s ability to hold above recent gains and break past resistance will likely dictate its direction in the coming weeks. Whether this move is the start of a bullish rally or another fake-out remains to be seen, but its price action is undoubtedly setting the stage for significant market moves. LTC Testing Crucial Supply Levels Litecoin (LTC) is trading at $127 after experiencing a strong bullish surge, climbing over 23% in less than two days. The recent price action has been impressive, as LTC reclaimed range highs and successfully pushed above the critical $120 mark. This move has shifted market sentiment, placing significant pressure on bears as the price approaches the next key resistance zones at $140 and $145. The $140 and $145 levels represent crucial supply zones that have historically acted as barriers to further upward movement. A breakout above these levels would not only signal a continuation of the bullish trend but also set the stage for Litecoin to test its multi-year high at $147. Analysts believe that reclaiming and holding above this level would trigger a massive rally, potentially propelling LTC into uncharted territory. Related Reading: Solana Holds Support Above Key Indicator – Expert Sees Push To ATH If Momentum Returns However, the coming days will be critical for Litecoin’s price trajectory. Bulls need to maintain momentum and defend current levels to sustain this upward move. If LTC successfully breaks above $147, it could attract more buyers, fueling further gains. Conversely, failing to clear these resistance levels could lead to consolidation or a minor retracement before another attempt at a breakout. All eyes are now on Litecoin as it approaches a decisive phase.

With its presale concluded, the spotlight moves to future market possibilities. Traders involved in the best crypto presale for 5thScape are now scouting for another prospect that promises robust returns and long-term growth potential.

As a result, the recent Bitcoin dip resulted in established projects like Cardano and meme coins like PEPE witnessing a market downturn. Therefore, investors are rotating to PropiChain as the next big opportunity with the potential to outperform other projects. This text will look into the Bitcoin price dip and how it sets PropiChain up for an explosive upside trajectory. The Bitcoin Price and its Impact on Cardano (ADA), PEPE, and PropiChain (PCHAIN) On the 2nd of this month, the Bitcoin price action dipped and was trading around the $92k range. This correction was a reaction to the global trade conflicts on import tariffs. Before the BTC dip, ADA was trading above $0.8, and following Bitcoin’s decline, it almost lost the $0.6 support level. PEPE, on the other hand, was at an $18 billion market cap at some point last month. Following the decline, it lost the $4 billion market cap support and has been trying to regain it. Even though the Bitcoin price has exceeded the $100k mark more than 3 times since its decline, PEPE and ADA are still struggling to regain momentum. Amid the Bitcoin price correction, PCHAIN’s presale keeps witnessing a massive inflow of investors. More than $2.5 million has been raised, and it is believed to be the best token presale in 2025. It is currently going for a low entry price of $0.011 in the second stage of its presale, which is set to increase by more than 100% in the third round. Here Are Some Offerings of PropiChain that is Driving the Hype Around the Project PropiChain’s proposed revolution in the real estate industry will benefit both existing and intending investors. The featured artificial intelligence, for instance, touches almost all aspects of the industry. It can help you get an asset that matches your investment goals. For instance, using the advanced filter tools returns recommendations closer to what you want. Potential ROI, substantial rental income, etc., can be your filter search keyword to suggest properties with increasing values or those suitable for rental. The PropiChain AI also offers predictive market analysis; therefore, making the right choice from the recommended assets is certain. It can do this by analyzing all the applicable data, such as past and present price performances, market trends, and other economic factors. Even if the property of your interest is on foreign soil, reaching the seller, inspecting, and acquiring it is possible remotely. PropiChain will integrate the 3D Metaverse environment to enable virtual meetings amongst international buyers and sellers. When it’s time to inspect, the 3D representation gives detailed information. Touring in an interactive environment is better than pictures and more cost-effective compared to flying abroad to inspect in person. All these ensure PropiChain investors experience advanced real estate early. Activities like leasing, lease renewal, and rental payment can be programmed. Thanks to smart contracts on PropiChain , you can set lease terms, and once you and your lessee reach a consensus, a legally binding contract can be formed without needing bulky legal papers. These smart contracts can further notify the landlord and tenants of the need to renew their agreement. The simple process involves the lessee agreeing to the updated terms sent by the smart contracts and instant renewal is processed. It can also be programmed to renew the lease once the terms agreed are met. The exact process can automate monthly rentals, and payments will be processed from users’ wallet balances. Unlike traditional financial services, payment is swift on PropiChain’s decentralized platform, and there is no need for long, unnecessary processing. Why PropiChain Will Outperform Cardano and PEPE Unlike PEPE, which thrives on speculative trading, and ADA, which is struggling with momentum, The real life application of PCHAIN is revolutionary and backed by a trillion-dollar sector. Being able to influence an ever-booming real estate industry is one of the many reasons experts believe so much in PropiChain . It has also raised over $2.5 million as the second presale increased momentum. This makes it an ideal choice for investors who want projects that can replicate the Bitcoin price 2013 surge. The early listing on CoinMarketCap has increased the project’s visibility in the global crypto market. Therefore, experts are forecasting it could deliver 30000% by early Q2 2025. Conclusion The BlockAudit positive report on PCHAIN is another testament to the legitimacy of this token. This report confirmed the security system is solid, and protecting investors’ assets is a top priority of the project. With this confirmation, smart investors are participating more with enhanced confidence. The Bitcoin price drops, but PropiChain maintains its increasing traction across the crypto world. Stage one investors are already in profit from the presale increase in value. The $0.011 will soon increase in the 3rd presale stage. Making now the best time to join. With the forecasted 30,000%, an investment of $1000 in this round could potentially yield $300k by early Q2 2025. Join now to position for a project that can replicate the Bitcoin price action early days surge in a few weeks.

In 2025, the buzz around certain presales is palpable, with Web3Bay leading the pack thanks to its unique decentralized e-commerce platform. Alongside Web3Bay, 5thScape and MEMEX are quickly making names for themselves as the top presale crypto projects to watch. Here’s a deeper dive into why these three crypto projects should be on your radar this week. 1. Web3Bay – The Top Presale Crypto Project Right Now Web3Bay shines in the presale arena, introducing a decentralized marketplace that aims to overhaul conventional e-commerce. The platform empowers users to manage their data and transactions securely, reflecting the increasing demand for privacy and safety online. Since the start of its presale, Web3Bay has collected over $1.1 million, selling 295 million tokens at $0.004562625 each. Currently, in Stage 4 of its presale, Web3Bay is gearing up for price hikes in subsequent phases of its 28-stage rollout. Early participants could see substantial gains, with the final token price projected at $0.1959. Given the solid investor interest and rising demand, Web3Bay’s presale could deliver returns similar to past blockchain successes, where early backers achieved gains ranging from 100 to 1,000 times their initial investment. Web3Bay sets itself apart from fleeting meme-centric projects by focusing on real-world utility and sustainable development, aiming to deliver real value to both individual users and businesses within its network. That’s why Web3Bay is highlighted as a top choice among presale crypto projects, promising significant long-term benefits following its official launch. 2. 5thScape – Pioneering the Future of VR and Metaverse A key project among the top presale crypto projects is 5thScape, which blends blockchain with virtual reality (VR). This initiative has already secured over $9.4 million, focusing on revolutionizing gaming, healthcare, and education through a VR ecosystem that lets users earn from their time in digital domains. 5thScape is set to become a significant force in both the metaverse and VR industries, which are expanding quickly. As it moves into new sectors, investors are eyeing considerable growth opportunities. Anticipation for 5thScape’s listings on exchanges like MEXC and BitMart is high, positioning it as a vital presale to monitor in the near future. 3. Meme Index – Broadening Meme Coin Investment Horizons The allure of meme coins has grown, yet the risk involved with individual investments remains high. MEMEX introduces a solution by offering a diversified portfolio of meme coins, enabling investors to manage risk by spreading investments across several assets, rather than relying on a single coin. Already attracting substantial attention, MEMEX offers staking and governance to token holders, presenting a less volatile entry into the meme coin market. For those seeking to mitigate risks while still tapping into the meme coin sector’s growth, MEMEX stands out as an appealing choice in top presale crypto projects, with proven scalability in the bustling meme coin arena. Key Crypto Presales to Watch Crypto presales provide an exclusive chance for investors to enter projects at early stages, often at prices well below eventual market rates. Web3Bay, 5thScape, and MEMEX are three diverse ventures offering unique entry points into different facets of the crypto world. Web3Bay is at the forefront with its decentralized marketplace and strong presale traction, aiming for long-term viability and substantial returns as it evolves. 5thScape, meanwhile, is carving out a leadership position in the virtual economy through its blockchain-enabled VR experiences. MEMEX, on the other hand, makes investing in meme coins simpler and safer with its diversified token basket, helping investors mitigate risk while still enjoying the sector’s growth potential. For those eager to invest early in promising ventures, these presales offer a chance to secure a position at the foundation, with the potential for hefty gains as the projects mature. However, thorough due diligence is always advised before making any investment decisions. If you’re considering diversifying your portfolio, Web3Bay, 5thScape, and MEMEX are worth a closer look this week.

Now, after three straight months of Bitcoin (BTC) dominance, it seems the altcoin market is ready to push back with a major inflow of investments into the sector. However, what’s most interesting from this altcoin rally are the lucrative opportunities expected to emerge, like the 22,000% explosion of the PropiChain (PCHAIN) AI altcoin, which powers a game-changing blockchain solution for the $634 trillion real estate industry. Bitcoin (BTC) Rally Slows Down: Is It Time For Altcoins to Shine? Bitcoin (BTC) took the market by storm over Q4 2024, running from $60k to $100k, making and breaking new all-time highs over the shortest span of its history. However, the same couldn’t be said for altcoins. When Bitcoin (BTC) was $60k, Ethereum (ETH) was $3k. Then BTC hit $80k, but ETH remained at $3k. BTC then set a new all-time high of $108k, and to much surprise, Ethereum failed to pump, sitting at $3k levels. While strange, analysts say the reason for this was a mega Bitcoin FOMO, which saw governments, institutions, and retail traders race to secure their spot early before BTC began its journey to $1m. But recent charts show a major Bitcoin (BTC) rejection , indicating that the hype is dying down, which will make way for altcoins to capitalize. Now begs the question: which altcoin is the best to buy now? Surprisingly, established altcoins have been displaced by the PropiChain (PCHAIN) AI altcoin, which could outperform the market in Q1 with a 22,000% run. PropiChain (PCHAIN) Real Estate Solutions Attracts 22,000% Rally for its AI Altcoin PropiChain (PCHAIN) isn’t just making an impact; it’s rewriting the rules of the $634 trillion real estate market while simultaneously revolutionizing Web3 and AI-powered investing. By merging blockchain with artificial intelligence, PropiChain is dismantling financial barriers, injecting liquidity into an industry notorious for its rigidity, and reshaping how properties are bought, sold, and managed. While PropiChain offers a suite of groundbreaking innovations, its AI investment solutions are emerging as the ultimate game-changer. The platform’s intelligent algorithms eliminate inefficiencies, streamline complex transactions, and introduce automation that the real estate sector has never seen before. PCHAIN token holders gain an edge with always-on AI assistance, instant property appraisals, predictive analytics, and real-time investment insights. PropiChain’s auto-trading functionality allows investors to capitalize on profitable deals 24/7 – executing high-value transactions even in their sleep. Yet, the most disruptive feature is PropiChain’s fractional ownership model , which levels the playing field in an industry historically reserved for the ultra-wealthy. PropiChain allows anyone to own a stake in high-value properties by tokenizing real estate on a secure blockchain, unlocking opportunities that were once out of reach. For as little as $100, investors can secure a 0.01% share in a $1 million asset, turning real estate from an illiquid, slow-moving investment into a liquid, tradeable asset. This seismic shift reduces transaction times from the industry-standard 44 days to mere minutes and drives an influx of capital that could reshape the global property market. PropiChain’s innovation doesn’t stop there. Its metaverse marketplace takes real estate into the digital age, offering virtual property tours, staging tools for design experimentation, and a seamless, borderless trading experience. Paired with smart contracts that automate rent collection, lease renewals, and management tasks, PropiChain (PCHAIN) is cementing itself as the definitive Web3 platform for the future of real estate. Security & Credibility: Two Powerful Reasons to Bet on PropiChain With so many crypto projects failing to meet basic security standards, investors are right to be cautious. That’s why PropiChain’s recent BlockAudit certification is so important. Known for its uncompromising audits, BlockAudit meticulously reviewed PropiChain’s smart contracts and security framework, finding no weaknesses or hidden risks. This stamp of approval assures investors that their funds are protected on a fully secure and transparent platform. Adding to this credibility boost, PropiChain has now been listed on CoinMarketCap , a key milestone that puts it in front of millions of investors worldwide. Visibility on this leading crypto tracking site signals that PropiChain is a legitimate and rapidly growing force in blockchain real estate. PropiChain Presale Surges as the Bitcoin Market Dominance Wanes PropiChain (PCHAIN) is emerging as the first commercially viable blockchain solution for real estate, set to redefine how properties are tokenized, traded, stored, and managed. With the real estate industry on the brink of a blockchain-driven transformation, the PCHAIN presale presents a rare opportunity to invest in a project poised to outshine much of the crypto market in 2025. Currently, in round two, PCHAIN is priced at just $0.01, which is the lowest it will ever be. Savvy investors are quietly accumulating their positions, recognizing that this stage offers the highest upside potential before prices rise. However, the tide is shifting fast, considering the sheer profit potential. Today’s modest $1,250 investment could grow to a staggering $275,000 by the end of Q1 as the Bitcoin (BTC) market dominance wanes. Early Bitcoin (BTC) holders especially know that opportunities like this don’t come twice. PropiChain will never be this undervalued again, and those who hesitate risk missing out on what could be a once-in-a-lifetime wealth-building event.

Other countries signed the agreement which pledges to inclusive, open, and ethical development and deployment of the technology. However, the two countries believe there is too much emphasis on AI regulation, which is not healthy for the growth of the industry. The UK and US think otherwise According to BBC , a dozen other countries including China, France, and India, signed the AI declaration which is meant to support AI safety. The UK, in a brief statement revealed that it had not added its name to the list due to concerns about national security and “global governance.” Earlier, US Vice President JD Vance told delegates in Paris that too much regulation on the technology could “kill a transformative industry just as it’s taking off.” He added the technology was an opportunity that the Trump administration would not want to waste, adding pro-growth AI policies should be prioritized over safety. This is in sharp contrast to what the French President Emmanuel Macron said as he supported the need for further regulation. “We need these rules for AI to move forward.” President Macron. Vice President Vance’s comments also conflict with the position that UK previously held as it championed AI safety. The then prime minister Rishi Sunak held the first global AI Safety Summit in November 2023. The UK government revealed in a statement that it “agreed with much of the leader’s declaration” yet felt it was lacking some parts. “We felt the declaration didn’t provide enough practical clarity on global governance, nor sufficiently address harder questions around national security and the challenge AI poses to it.” UK government spokesperson. A trade body representing businesses in the sector across the country, UKAI opines this is a step in the right direction. “UKAI cautiously welcomes the Government’s refusal to sign this statement as an indication that it will explore the more pragmatic solutions that UKAI has been calling for – retaining opportunities to work closely with our US partners.” UKAI CEO Tim Flagg. “While UKAI agrees that being environmentally responsible is important, we question how to balance this responsibility with the growing needs of the AI industry for more energy,” said Flagg. Is the UK undercutting its credibility? According to Andrew Dudfield, head of AI at Full Fact, a fact-checking organization said the UK’s decision to refuse to sign the agreement puts it in jeopardy. “By refusing to sign today’s international AI Action Statement the UK Government risks undercutting its hard-won credibility as a world leader for safe, ethical and trustworthy AI innovation,” he said. The Paris communique seeks to limit the digital divide by promoting accessibility to the AI technology. It also seeks to ensure AI development is “transparent,” “safe,” as well as “secure and trustworthy.” “Making AI sustainable for people and the planet,” is listed as a further priority. According to the BBC, the agreement also touches on AI energy use. Experts have warned that AI energy use could balloon to as much as what small countries require in years to come. “Looking at the summit declaration, it’s difficult to pinpoint what exactly in that statement the government disagrees with,” said Michael Birtwistle, associate director at the Ada Lovelace Institute. The UK has also insisted that the decision was not influenced by the Trump administration but purely guided by “our own national interest, ensuring the balance between opportunity and national security.” World over, executives, diplomats and policymakers have been considering methods to capture the economic benefits of the AI technology , while addressing its technology’s risks.

In a new announcement from Uniswap Labs, the firm says Unichain mainnet officially launched today according to plan. As per the announcement, Unichain will be a layer-2 optimized for decentralized finance (DeFi) transactions on Ethereum. Starting today, developers can use Unichain to begin deploying apps and building with stablecoins, and users of the new layer-2 can fund their wallet, launch tokens, play with new apps, provide liquidity and do swaps, according to the blog post. A post from Unichain to the social media platform X broke down the new chain’s advantages into three main points. “Unichain mainnet is live – Fast with low fees – Built for cross-chain liquidity – Prioritizes decentralization from day one You can now deploy DeFi apps, launch tokens, swap, provide liquidity, and more.” Within hours of launching, leading US crypto exchange Coinbase announced support for Unichain. “Coinbase Onramp is expanding to Unichain. Unichain users now have a seamless way to convert fiat-to-crypto, with fee-free USDC on-ramping available at launch. Unichain is a fast, decentralized Superchain L2 designed to be a home for DeFi and cross-chain liquidity.” Uniswap labs announced the launch of the mainnet last month. “Once the new system’s safety and stability are validated, mainnet will be open for everyone! Users will be able to bridge funds directly to the network, and applications supporting Unichain will go live.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The altcoin space took the most beating, with the global market cap experiencing one of its biggest devaluations on record. Last week, Bitcoin investors endured what Glassnode called an intense whipsaw in price action. The leading digital asset saw its price initially fall as low as $93k, after which it recovered briefly and rallied to $102k. Now, it is trading closer to $95k. 14-day Bitcoin price chart, since January 29. Source: Glassnode The realized losses recorded by Bitcoin investors during those choppy swings in price action is being touted as one of the largest of the current bull market cycle. Bitcoin investors see small respite despite losses Investors lost around $520M as the market sold off to $93k, making it one of the largest local capitulation events so far. In fact, only the losses locked in on August 5, 2023, during the yen-carry trade unwind, stand out as a larger one-day loss. The majority of realized losses were recorded by short-term holders, especially those who acquired their coins within the last month. Their willingness to sell at a loss hints at their sensitivity to price fluctuations. The volatile price action is, for the most part, a response to President Trump’s threat of tariffs applied to Canada, Mexico, and China, which provides an uncertain macro backdrop for investors as everyone watches the drama play out. Besides this, the persistent strength of the US dollar has contributed to a marginally stressed liquidity environment. Fortunately, even though the price of Bitcoin has fluctuated wildly in recent weeks, it has not strayed very far from its starting position during this cycle, so the choppy price action and generally sideways movement continue to prevail. This is thanks to the substantial uptick in liquidity entering Bitcoin and larger capital flows that are balancing the inertia of an increasingly large asset. The growing presence of a more resilient and patient group of holders has also contributed to the relative stability BTC prices are enjoying, even amidst the relatively unstable macro backdrop. Will the bull run ever reach the altcoin sector? While Bitcoin has not been immune to the volatility in the markets, Glassnode analysts believe it is doing relatively well. The same can not be said for the altcoin sector, which experienced significant sell-side pressure amidst the volatility as many assets struggled to achieve widespread adoption or product-market fit, presenting a more challenging market environment. This has led to a wide-scale collapse of token prices, with all altcoin sub-sectors underperforming Bitcoin in recent weeks. Using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) which projects the correlation of token returns into a two-dimensional space to analyze the downside price action, they found that the majority of ERC-20 tokens are densely clustered. What this means is that a good majority of altcoins had to deal with the same broad-based sell-off, without as much an unexplainable distinction between different sectors. In short, very few tokens were immune to the downside volatility as most of the market dipped at once. The magnitude of the dip becomes more apparent when examining the 14-day change in the global altcoin market cap. Over the last two weeks, $234B left the altcoin market cap. The altcoin market is essentially in a bear market, which is very interesting because as it stands, Bitcoin is having a good run and is not displaying the same relative weakness. This suggests a divergence is opening up between BTC and the rest of the digital asset landscape. Key support levels for Bitcoin have been identified at the Mean MVRV Z-Score of $96.3k and the short-term holder cost basis around $92.2k. Meanwhile, the outlook for the altcoin sector is more uncertain and less optimistic, with hopes of an altcoin market fading with its hemorrhaging valuation.

Now he needs a court order to get it back, according to a Monday filing in Delaware bankruptcy court. At the time Bartusek made the deposit, Solana was worth $31, putting his deposit’s value at around $63,700. Since then, Solana’s price has surged to $198, meaning his locked-up funds are worth $396,000 as of press time. According to the filing , FTX “knowingly and willingly” accepted the deposit. Now they’re telling Bartusek that he would need a court order to withdraw the funds. Bartusek’s issue began when he attempted a withdrawal request on October 22, 2023, from a crypto wallet linked to BTSE, another exchange. Instead of moving his 2,000 SOL to a different account, he accidentally deposited it into his old FTX account, which you’d think would have been frozen since the company was knee-deep in the middle of bankruptcy proceedings. But they weren’t, and by the time Bartusek realized the mistake, FTX’s legal team told him that his funds couldn’t be returned without a judge’s approval. Bankruptcy law prevents companies from distributing funds outside an approved court process, meaning even accidental deposits remain locked. Bartusek’s attorney, Jack Shrum, said that cases like these aren’t uncommon. “Some people utilize several different crypto wallets, so depositing into one wallet that happens to be in bankruptcy is not difficult to imagine,” he explained. Unfortunately, Bartusek isn’t the only one struggling to retrieve funds. Thousands of FTX users have been stuck in limbo since FTX collapsed in November 2022, with customer withdrawals frozen for over two years, waiting to see if they will ever recover their lost assets. FTX’s bankruptcy team finally started paying back some customers on Feb. 8. Under the FTX Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization, the company confirmed that initial distributions will begin on Feb. 18, but they apply only to creditors with approved claims in the Convenience Classes, meaning users who completed the pre-distribution requirements. Customers eligible for repayments should expect their funds within one to three business days from February 18. According to its official press announcement, FTX has transferred funds to BitGo and Kraken, which are acting as Distribution Service Providers. These companies will handle retail and institutional distributions in supported jurisdictions according to the bankruptcy plan.

This is in line with the acknowledgment of Grayscale’s Solana ETF application, which was made in the previous month. SEC ACKNOWLEDGES FILING FOR CANARY SPOT SOLANA ETF — Phoenix » PhoenixNews.io (@PhoenixNewsIO) February 11, 2025 The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has also initiated a comment period for a 21-day period. This will be followed by either approval, rejection, or an extension of the duration of review by the agency. The filing comes amidst a rising number of crypto-related ETFs aiming to gain state approval. Compared to the previous years, many expect a more favorable stance from the SEC compared. The application resembles one that was used for Bitcoin ETFs, which were previously approved. According to market analysts, Grayscale’s Solana ETF, which is slightly ahead in the process of review, may serve as a precedent for future ETF applications, including that of Canary. Institutional players enter the Solana ETF race Cboe BZX Exchange has also filed rule changes to list spot Solana ETFs from various issuers, such as 21Shares AG, Bitwise, Van Eck, and Canary Capital. The filings represent a notable move toward the introduction of the altcoin ETFs in the conventional financial markets. Franklin Templeton has also entered the race by filing documents for a Delaware Solana Trust. The firm had in the past reported a positive outlook on Solana regarding its growing adoption and use cases. Like other issuers, Franklin’s filing hints it could soon submit a full ETF application. Interest in Solana from institutions is still rising. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan, JPMorgan estimates that an approved Solana ETF could attract $3bn to $6bn in net assets within its first year. Some experts believe this will also fast-track the adoption of other altcoin ETFs, including XRP and Dogecoin. James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg ETF analysts, estimate a 70% chance of Solana ETFs receiving approval this year. They base their analysis on the SEC’s changing stance on digital assets.

Or, he might simply remain a billionaire. The answer depends on who you ask. According to startup founders and AI experts, the firm’s value estimates range from $1 billion to $150 billion. The mid-range puts the firm between $2 billion and $30 billion, placing Liang with his 84% stake among Asia’s wealthiest tech moguls, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index . DeepSeek shrouds its valuation in secrecy, leaving investors guessing Since the funding and revenue of DeepSeek are not openly available to the public, it has not been easy to come up with the correct value for the company. This company is privately owned, and according to the available information, it has been financed by Liang’s hedge fund trading proceeds. “It’s basically impossible to give a convincing answer here because it’s a secretive firm,” says Jeffrey Emanuel, the founder of Pastel Network. DeepSeek’s public relations have chosen to stay neutral and have not commented on the company’s valuation, leaving the competition for the sources of the estimates. AI specialists and startup founders have analyzed DeepSeek’s valuation. Glasswing Ventures Managing Partner Rudina Seseri values the company at a minimum of one billion dollars compared with other AI firms such as OpenAI and Anthropic. However, some, such as Chanakya Ramdev of Sweat Free Telecom, think that DeepSeek can be worth half of OpenAI’s $300 billion valuation but is higher than Nvidia’s Jensen Huang. The current discussions on DeepSeek’s valuation are being conducted at a time of surge in AI investment. For instance, Anthropic, an AI company supported by Amazon, is worth $60 billion, while Mistral AI from France is worth $6 billion. Comparisons have also been drawn with China’s Zhipu AI, valued at $3 billion. However, it is hard to determine the stability of this sector because it is volatile. Recently, Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, rejected a $97.4 billion bid from investors, including Elon Musk, to buyout OpenAI’s controlling nonprofit. DeepSeek’s impact goes beyond the guesswork of the value. The company has reversed the conventional wisdom on AI innovation, disrupting Silicon Valley’s primacy and fueling global shifts in AI power. It even spurred the biggest stock drop in Nvidia’s history, indicating the shift in the AI world. Liang Wenfeng builds an AI empire that challenges global markets Liang Wenfeng was born in 1985 in Zhanjiang, China, and graduated from Zhejiang University with a degree in electronic engineering before pursuing a master’s in information and communication engineering. Quantitative trading was his first career choice; he co-founded Zhejiang High-Flyer Asset Management, which at one point controlled $12 billion. Liang created DeepSeek in 2023 as an AI venture for his hedge fund, Zhejiang High-Flyer Asset Management, which Liang and two other engineers from Zhejiang University set up. The trio began trading as students during the global financial crisis. Despite the fact that the company is quite young, it has already been restricted by “hundreds” of companies, while governments from Australia to South Korea have also restricted access to government devices due to security concerns. When strategic investments start coming in from Chinese tech giants like Microsoft did with OpenAI, then DeepSeek’s value will be further solidified. According to Emanuel, even at what seems to be very high valuations, these investments could be very valuable in the long run. DeepSeek is currently an enigma, a company whose value is still unknown but one that has changed the AI investment landscape. The big question still remains: Will Liang Wenfeng keep on the path to becoming one of the richest people in the world, or will DeepSeek’s valuation be on the lower end of the estimate? Only time will tell.

This stance marks a notable shift from earlier considerations where the Federal Reserve had been exploring the potential of a digital dollar. No CBDC For The United States, Powell Confirms This declaration came during a recent Senate Banking Committee hearing on Tuesday when Powell responded to a direct question from Senator Bernie Moreno (R-OH). “Can I have your commitment that as long as you’re the chair of the Federal Reserve system, that we will never have a central bank digital currency?” Moreno asked. “Yes,” Powell responded. The Fed’s previous research on CBDCs aimed at understanding how such a currency might improve the current payment system’s efficiency and safety. Critics of CBDCs, including the Cato Institute’s Nicholas Anthony, have praised Powell’s commitment, citing potential risks to financial freedom, privacy, and market stability. Unlike decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, a CBDC would be government-issued and regulated, potentially leading to concerns over surveillance due to its trackable nature. This announcement comes at a time when several countries are actively experimenting with their own digital currencies. Notably, China’s digital yuan pilot started in 2020, with other nations like Russia, Turkey, and Japan also exploring similar initiatives. Republicans Stopping CBDCs Powell’s firm stance highlights a divergence in U.S. policy compared to these global trends, especially under the current U.S. administration led by President Trump. Senator Moreno specifically praised Powell’s stance since it meant the U.S. wouldn’t wind up “looking like China” in any way. The debate around CBDCs in the U.S. has seen significant political pushback, especially from Republican lawmakers who have called for bans on government-issued digital currencies. Last year, the House of Representatives passed a bil l from Congressman Tom Emmer to ban the Federal Reserve from issuing a CBDC. In his recent crypto executive order , President Donald Trump also prohibited Federal agencies from attempting to promote or issue a CBDC. Powell’s clear statement might provide some relief to those concerned about the implications of CBDCs on personal freedoms and privacy.

Under the Republican-led subcommittee's title ""A Golden Age of Digital Assets,"" the industry representatives showed up in the hearing with momentum at all levels of the federal government, including from the White House, whose crypto czar was the one to first utter the ""golden age"" phrase . Just over two years after the devastation of collapsing crypto lenders and the criminal implosion of FTX in 2022, the industry has proven its sharp recovery with a slate of lawmakers clearly on-board for the legislation the industry has been calling for. ""Under the Trump administration, we will course correct by creating a workable pathway for responsible digital asset companies to set up operations here in the United States,"" said Representative Bryan Steil, a Wisconsin Republican who chairs the subcommittee that's an offshoot of the House Financial Services Committee. Republicans on the panel decried the ""unpredictable and hostile approach"" to crypto of former President Joe Biden's administration (as Steil put it), with an executive branch that's already reversing some of those past policies at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Securities and Exchange Commission. But the holy grail for the industry is a wide-reaching bill like the one passed in the House in the previous session of Congress. ""There are many issues to debate over the next several years, but we need to move now and put that basic foundation in place,"" said Jonathan Jachym, a lawyer and global head of policy at U.S. exchange Kraken. Among the hearing's witnesses was Timothy Massad, a former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission when it first flagged bitcoin (BTC) as a commodity. He cautioned the lawmakers not to push too hard into the details as they craft their digital assets market-structure legislation, because he said the CFTC and the SEC are more expert in the minutiae it'll require, and the agency leaders should be the ones to work out the technical aspects. This was the first hearing of the digital assets panel during this new Congress, but other committees in both chambers have already been digging into crypto-heavy issues, such as debanking. Earlier on Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell agreed that debanking is a problem worth exploring , and he also agreed that the Fed wouldn't be chasing a central bank digital currency on his watch. While Republicans and the industry witnesses bashed the Biden administration's track record, Dems took the opportunity to criticize President Donald Trump for embracing crypto for his personal gain by backing memecoin $TRUMP, which they characterized as a ""crypto scam"" that presents a dangerous conflict and may violate the constitutional provision against federal officials seeking profit from their office.",Policy|U.S. Congress|House Financial Services Committee|Donald Trump|crypto legislation,EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|BTC|FIAT|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-11 23:23:43

Why It Is The Best Time To Sell,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-to-hit-ath-above-1/,"The Dogecoin price is ready to hit new all-time highs , as a crypto analyst has projected a surge above $1 by March. The analyst’s technical analysis of Dogecoin using Fibonacci time zones suggests that the next few months could be a pivotal period for investors and DOGE holders , with March shaping up as an ideal time to capitalize on potential gains. Dogecoin Price To Rally Above $1 In March Chandler, a crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), has shared a technical analysis of Dogecoin using Fibonacci time zones and retracement levels to predict its next movements. These time zones, indicated by the vertical lines on the chart, mark significant intervals based on Fibonacci ratios . They are often used to determine potential areas where price reversals or significant swings may occur. The analyst pointed to the 0.236 Fibonacci time zone, noting that Dogecoin has historically shown strong bullish moves after crossing this line, typically reaching a peak within one to two weeks. Based on this recurring pattern, Chandler predicts Dogecoin will break past this time zone around March 24, 2025. He suggests that the price could reclaim its previous $0.73 ATH and break above the $1 mark for the first time. Chandler’s chart shows key Fibonacci retracement levels that indicate support and resistance zones for DOGE. The 0.236, 0.382, and 0.618 are key levels where the Dogecoin price trends to retrace before embarking on a bullish continuation. The 1.00 Fibonacci indicates an all-time high level where strong resistance is typically found. Additionally, the 0.236 and 0.382 Fib levels are targets for the third higher high during bullish phases. In the price chart, the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd higher highs mark bull market phases where DOGE consistently made new highs. While Chandler projects that Dogecoin could hit its highest market price above $1, he also anticipates that reaching this milestone would trigger a major bearish shift in the market, resulting in significant sell-offs. Why March Could Be The Best Time To Sell Despite predicting a rally above $1 for the Dogecoin price , Chandler also warns of an impending bear market later in the year. The analyst believes that by October 10, 2025, Dogecoin could crash to new lows from its projected ATH. He forecasts that the meme coin will initiate this price decline once it reaches the 0.382 Fibonacci time zone. This threshold has historically marked the beginning of significant downtrends and volatility for Dogecoin. Chandler’s analysis indicates that the window between March and April could be the best time for investors to sell their DOGE holdings . This timeframe aligns with the analyst’s $1 price projection for DOGE, suggesting a strategy of selling at price peaks to minimize potential losses during the anticipated bear market phase that may follow.",Altcoin News|Dogecoin|Chnadler|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Fibonacci Retracement,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-02-11 23:30:21

Crytpo custodian BitGo is considering an IPO as soon as the second half of this year, joining a flood of companies in the sector anticipating more support for their plans from regulators. https://t.co/oxu8e9lSaL — Bloomberg (@business) February 11, 2025 Citing sources familiar with the matter, the company is in discussions with potential advisors to prepare for a public listing—a move that would mark a major milestone for a firm that has long been synonymous with institutional-grade cryptocurrency security. Founded in 2013, the firm is known for multi-signature and threshold signature technologies. BitGo serves more than 1,500 institutional clients across 50 countries. The firm’s services include regulated custody, trading, lending, and DeFi solutions, making it a critical infrastructure provider for the digital asset market. According to sources, an IPO would not only offer liquidity to early investors but also supply the company with fresh capital to expand its product offerings in a competitive sector. Optimism in the Crypto Industry The potential public debut comes amid a wave of optimism in the crypto industry, as a growing number of firms anticipate regulatory support for their listing plans. Recent developments suggest that regulators may adopt a more accommodating stance toward crypto companies, providing the kind of clarity that has been lacking in recent years. Industry analysts believe that an IPO from a well-established player like BitGo would signal maturity in the crypto market. As the company finalizes its discussions with advisors and prepares the necessary documentation, market participants are keenly anticipating further updates on the timing and valuation of the offering. BitGo Introduces Institutional Bitcoin Staking with Core DAO In a joint announcement on December 9, 2024, BitGo stated that it would be one of the first custodians to facilitate institutional access to dual staking with Core DAO, allowing clients to earn returns on their Bitcoin holdings. @BitGo has introduced institutional-grade Bitcoin staking through a partnership with @Coredao_Org , a layer-1 blockchain platform. #BitGo #CoreDAO https://t.co/PTFF8ynr2T — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 10, 2024 The staking mechanism enables institutions to maintain full custody of their assets, mitigating counterparty risks often associated with traditional staking methods. As BitGo moves toward a public listing, its success or failure could influence how other crypto firms approach capital markets. A strong debut might encourage more institutional investment, while challenges could highlight the hurdles the industry still faces. Either way, this IPO will be closely watched as a potential benchmark for crypto’s place in traditional finance.

But which one will be the next to deliver jaw-dropping returns? With market excitement rising, Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is making waves with its dynamic presale, while Turbo and Book of Meme continue to generate buzz in the space. Arctic Pablo Coin’s unique approach to its presale and deflationary mechanics has positioned it as a strong contender for the next big meme coin rally.

This article will cover the developments and updates of all three coins: Arctic Pablo Coin, Turbo, and Book of Meme. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Revolutionary Token Burn Mechanism Enhances Scarcity One of the most exciting aspects of Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale is its aggressive token burn mechanism. Every week, unsold tokens are permanently removed from circulation, drastically reducing supply and driving value higher. But it doesn’t stop there—after the presale, any remaining tokens will also be burned, making Arctic Pablo Coin one of the most deflationary meme coins in the space. Built on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Arctic Pablo Coin ensures transparency by recording every token burn on-chain. With a strategic burn model, early investors could see their holdings increase in value as supply diminishes over time. This scarcity-driven approach makes Arctic Pablo Coin stand out among the top new meme coins to join for the short term. Arctic Pablo Coin Presale – Aqua Forest Phase Creates Massive Hype The Arctic Pablo Coin meme coin presale is reaching an electrifying stage as it enters Aqua Forest, its 10th phase. Unlike traditional presales with rigid stages, this journey-based model keeps the momentum going as Arctic Pablo Coin “travels” across different locations.

Currently priced at just $0.000059, investors jumping in at this phase are looking at a staggering 13,451.72% potential ROI when it hits its launch price of $0.008. As each new phase arrives, the price climbs, making early entry crucial. Arctic Pablo Coin’s journey is capturing major attention, solidifying its position among the top new meme coins to join for short term. Turbo Rolls Out Major Feature Updates Turbo has been making strides with its latest feature rollout, integrating AI-powered trading bots to enhance market efficiency. These bots aim to provide better liquidity and mitigate large price fluctuations, making Turbo a more stable and attractive investment. This update has fueled investor optimism, leading to a recent spike in trading volume and increased engagement from the crypto community. Book of Meme Gains Momentum with Community-Driven Innovations Book of Meme continues to thrive by leveraging a unique combination of meme culture and blockchain utility. The project recently announced a new governance model that allows token holders to vote on major updates and platform features. This move has strengthened community involvement and led to a surge in demand, pushing its market cap to new highs. Conclusion: Arctic Pablo Coin’s Presale Is the One to Watch With meme coins generating massive returns, Arctic Pablo Coin stands out as a prime contender for major gains. Its aggressive token burn strategy, unique presale structure, and skyrocketing investor interest make it a must-watch. Turbo and Book of Meme are also making waves, but Arctic Pablo Coin’s deflationary model and travel-themed presale create an unmatched opportunity. As each phase pushes the price higher, now is the perfect time to get in before the next jump. Don’t miss out—Arctic Pablo Coin could be the meme coin moonshot of the year! For More Information: Arctic Pablo Coin: https://www.arcticpablo.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/ArcticPabloOfficial Twitter: https://x.com/arcticpabloHQ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What makes Arctic Pablo Coin different from other meme coins?

The Tokyo-listed online mobile gaming firm intends to strengthen its position in cryptocurrency by using Bitcoin for blockchain staking. Gumi Joins Babylon Staking According to reports, the company’s board of directors approved the decision as part of its strategy to expand its blockchain node operation business. This move positions Gumi as a key player in Japan’s growing Web3 industry. Following this development, Gumi will become the first publicly listed Japanese company to serve as a validator in the Babylon staking protocol. This role will enable the company to earn rewards while contributing to blockchain security. In a statement, Gumi emphasized that the investment would help strengthen its blockchain operations and increase its influence in the Web3 space. The company also confirmed that it would closely monitor its Bitcoin holdings and update its financial records accordingly. “ Through this initiative, we aim to further strengthen our node operation business and enhance our presence in the Web3 domain,” Gumi stated. Interestingly, Gumi’s stock price rose following the announcement. According to Google Finance data, its shares increased by 3.6%, reaching ¥454 (about $3) after the news broke. Asian Companies Continue to Adopt Bitcoin Gumi’s decision reiterates a growing trend of Asian businesses investing in cryptocurrency. In December 2024, Japanese energy and consulting firm Remixpoint added $1.38 million worth of Bitcoin to its portfolio, increasing its total crypto holdings to $27.59 million. Meanwhile, Tokyo-listed Metaplanet saw a sharp rise in its stock value after adopting a Bitcoin standard in April 2024. The company now aims to acquire 21,000 BTC by 2026. Expanding Institutional Cryptocurrency Network Amid Regulatory Actions Notably, as more entities explore Bitcoin and blockchain staking, institutional interest in cryptocurrency is rising in Japan. Gumi’s latest move reveals its confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential and the broader Web3 industry. At the same time, Japan is tightening regulations on unregistered crypto exchanges. Last week, Apple removed crypto trading apps like Bybit, Bitget, MEXC, KuCoin, and Bitcastle from its Japan store. This action followed multiple warnings from Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA), urging these platforms to comply with local regulations or leave the market.

Right now, XRP and Binance Coin (BNB) are showing solid stability in the marketplace, with XRP priced at around $2.98 and BNB at about $670. Both coins are key for enabling quick, cost-effective transactions on their respective blockchains. However, while many are watching their price charts, a significant shift is underway with Web3 payments emerging as a savvy shopping solution. Here’s where Web3Bay steps into the spotlight. Unlike traditional platforms burdened with hidden costs, Web3Bay eliminates intermediary fees and facilitates immediate crypto transactions. Customers paying with cryptocurrencies like BNB, XRP, and others can access discounts, making regular purchases more affordable. As more individuals move to Web3 payments, those who join early are saving more, while others continue to pay more. Save More with Web3Bay’s Crypto Payments Thinking of crypto payments only in terms of trading? Time to reconsider. Web3Bay is transforming online purchasing with its Web3 payment system. Here, users enjoy speedy transactions and no hidden fees, alongside exclusive discounts when using cryptocurrencies such as XRP, BNB, or other supported coins. This means more of your money is spent on your actual purchases rather than going to intermediaries. Moreover, Web3Bay’s presale is drawing interest due to its accessible starting price and potential for substantial returns. The platform has already secured over $1.1 million, pricing its 3BAY token at just $0.004562 in the fourth presale stage. With plans to launch the token at $0.1959, early backers could see significant gains once it begins trading. Unlike traditional e-commerce sites that take a portion of every sale, Web3Bay’s approach rewards its users, allowing them to keep more of their money. The evolution towards Web3 payments is making conventional shopping seem outdated. Web3Bay offers consumers direct control over their finances, bypassing traditional banks and payment processors. The possibility of paying with major cryptocurrencies like XRP while enjoying discounts and seamless transactions places Web3Bay in a favorable position. As the platform expands, early adopters are set to benefit the most, leaving those who stick with old methods paying more at traditional outlets. XRP Crypto: Solid Market Performance with Practical Use XRP is not just for trading anymore. Currently priced at around $2.98, XRP has experienced significant growth, driven by positive expectations regarding regulatory outcomes and broader adoption. Some experts anticipate its value could reach between $5 and $7, with more optimistic projections suggesting it could surpass $10. The excitement surrounding Ripple’s developments and the increasing demand for quick, cost-effective blockchain solutions have made XRP a hot topic in the financial community. Moreover, XRP excels in Web3 payment applications. Thanks to its fast transaction times and minimal fees, it’s perfect for use on platforms like Web3Bay, where users can complete payments instantly without any deductions from intermediaries. As Web3 payments gain traction, the practical applications for XRP are expected to expand, benefiting those who invest early. Binance Coin: A Valuable Payment and Utility Asset Binance Coin (BNB) maintains its status as a leading cryptocurrency, with its current trading price near $670. Despite some price volatility, it continues to be a preferred choice for transactions on the Binance exchange and beyond. Binance’s strategy of burning tokens to reduce supply, along with new features on the BNB Chain introduced by PancakeSwap, keeps the demand for BNB robust. In December 2024, it reached a peak of $794, indicating its potential for future growth. BNB also plays a crucial role in Web3 payments. On platforms like Web3Bay, users benefit from Binance Coin and XRP for fast, fee-free transactions. As more online retailers adopt cryptocurrency payments, BNB’s advantages in reducing costs and speeding up transactions make it an appealing option for digital shoppers. Wrapping Up Both XRP and Binance Coin (BNB) are proving their worth beyond mere trading. XRP is becoming popular as an efficient, affordable option for transactions, with future price potential ranging from $5 to $10. Binance Coin is also asserting its utility, currently valued at around $670, supported by ongoing demand due to Binance’s strategic token burns and ecosystem enhancements. The real transformation is occurring in Web3 payments . Web3Bay illustrates how cryptocurrencies can extend beyond asset holding — they can also streamline purchasing, eliminate hidden costs, and enable immediate transactions. With the 3BAY token presale ongoing, early participants are poised to gain the most before the platform fully launches.

Currently, DOT’s price is $4.61, with predictions ranging from $4.81 to $18.01 for 2025. On the other hand, LINK stands at $18.96, with forecasts suggesting a rise to between $25 and $100, influenced by DeFi integration and large-scale purchases. Both are garnering interest, yet there’s another exciting option available. BlockDAG (BDAG) introduces a straightforward method to profit from crypto. Skip the trading and mining—BlockDAG’s affiliate program instantly pays 5% USDT cashback for each referral purchase.

Predicting Polkadot’s Future: Upcoming DOT Price Ranges Polkadot is now priced at $4.61, experiencing some resistance as the market anticipates its next direction. Analysts predict a DOT price range from $4.81 to $18.01 by 2025, influenced by adoption rates and general market trends. While its short-term path is unclear, DOT’s significance in enabling multichain interoperability keeps it central in the crypto dialogue. Looking ahead, DOT might challenge the $14.04 mark as a crucial resistance point, with potential to reach up to $18.01 if positive momentum continues. The trajectory largely hinges on the expansion of Polkadot’s ecosystem and market confidence. As traders ponder DOT’s potential, platforms like BlockDAG are drawing interest by offering passive rewards, presenting an alternative to price-dependent strategies. For now, the focus remains on identifying DOT’s next significant movement. Chainlink’s Future Trajectory: Updated Price Insights Chainlink is trading at $18.96 and currently under scrutiny as significant holders recently sold off 23 million LINK tokens, totaling about $455 million. Despite these sales, signs of accumulation are visible, with declining LINK balances on exchanges suggesting potential price resilience. Analysts are split on Chainlink’s future, estimating a 2025 price range from $25 to $100, dictated by its adoption in the DeFi sector. Long-term outlooks are more optimistic, with predictions for 2030 ranging from $48 to $100, assuming Chainlink continues leading as a trusted oracle provider. Short-term price movements will depend on overall market dynamics and the demand for its technology. While the market awaits a definitive trend, those seeking simpler gains are exploring BlockDAG, known for its direct rewards rather than speculative investment. The Bottom Line Current forecasts place Polkadot’s DOT price between $4.81 and $18.01, whereas Chainlink’s potential shift for 2025 could span from $25 to $100. Both projects maintain solid fundamentals, yet their future prices are not guaranteed. As traders monitor the movements of DOT and LINK, BlockDAG presents a distinctive offering—immediate rewards without relying on market fluctuations. BlockDAG’s affiliate scheme allows users to earn directly from crypto without the need to trade or mine. Each referral results in a 5% instant USDT cashback (BEP-20), with no ceiling on potential earnings.

This development is outlined in the 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which reveal the firm’s escalated commitment to digital asset investments. Goldman Sachs Expands Crypto Portfolio, Adds $1.5B in Bitcoin ETFs According to a recent SEC filing , Goldman Sachs has significantly increased its investments in Bitcoin ETFs. The report details an 88% increase in the firm’s holdings in the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), bringing its investment to $1.27 billion. This uptick is part of a broader strategy by Goldman Sachs to deepen its footprint in the digital assets space. The filing also highlights a substantial growth in Goldman’s holdings of the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), with a 105% increase compared to the previous quarter. This growth has boosted the FBTC position to a value of $288 million. These developments reflect a confident move by the bank to leverage the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies. In addition to these holdings, Goldman Sachs CEO, David Solomon, recently dismissed Bitcoin as a threat to the US dollar’s dominance. He reiterated that Bitcoin remains a speculative asset, emphasizing its volatility and uncertain regulatory landscape. Regulatory Filings Illuminate Investment Trends Goldman Sachs’ latest 13F filings provide a window into the firm’s investment tactics. The filings reveal a strategic embrace of Bitcoin ETFs among its asset management practices. These filings are mandatory for institutional investment managers with equity assets over $100 million, offering a periodic overview of their holdings. Goldman’s increasing investments in BTC ETFs coincide with the ongoing development of regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies. This trend suggests a strong institutional belief in the long-term viability of digital assets. The firm’s strategic positioning also includes the use of derivatives such as calls and puts, showcasing a refined strategy for managing crypto exposure. Market Implications of Crypto Strategy Goldman Sachs’ diversified approach to its digital asset portfolio enhances its market standing and sets a benchmark for other institutional investors considering crypto expansions. More so, CEO David Solomon has outlined conditions for Goldman Sachs to expand into crypto markets . He stressed the need for regulatory changes. Solomon confirmed the firm has built infrastructure around digital assets. However, legal constraints block direct trading of Bitcoin and Ethereum. In related news, the US SEC is actively reviewing BlackRock’s proposal for in-kind Bitcoin ETF redemptions, which could enhance market liquidity and reduce transaction costs. If approved, this change would allow authorized participants to receive Bitcoin directly instead of cash during redemptions.

Despite this, onchain signs of Shiba Inu whale return signal positive long-term prospects for the memecoin. At the time of writing, the SHIB price changed hands for $0.00001574, which was down marginally by 0.54% in 24 hours. With the whale swooping in, the token might be setting the pace for a new rally. Shiba Inu Whales Might Make the Difference According to data insight from IntoTheBlock, Shiba Inu whale transactions have jumped by 20.69% in 24 hours. Based on this rally, the large transactions amount to $26.66 million within the time under review. Per the data, 80 SHIB whale transactions have been registered over 24 hours. This figure marks an average from the weekly low of 42 transactions and a high of 185. Per volume, more than 1.69 trillion SHIB tokens were moved by the traders initiating the large transactions. While the 7-day high stood at 5.84 trillion SHIB, the lowest recorded figure comes in at 890.85 billion SHIB. Shiba Inu Whale Transactions. Source: IntoTheBlock It is worth noting that these whale transactions mark those worth at least $100,000. As spotted onchain, a SHIB whale moved over 3 trillion tokens a few days ago, sparking speculations. At a time when the price of Shiba Inu needs a viable anchor, massive shifts by SHIB whales might reshape sentiment. Shiba Inu Growing Footprint Despite ranking as the second-largest memecoin in the Web3 space, Shiba Inu has a bigger community of builders. Through Shibarium, the token has continued to expand its footprint. As reported recently, the token expanded to UAE , partnering with the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure (MoEI). This collaboration helped expand the SHIB footprint and utilize its ShibOS to enhance the MoEI digital operations. In addition, the developer team is integrating new solutions like the Full Homorphobic Encryption (FHE) designed for privacy. This ecosystem push bordering on every aspect of its operations is pushing Shiba Inu as an attractive token to whales. If the trend is sustained, the token may reclaim its 30-day high of $0.00002488. SHIB Rally Is Imminent Beyond the push to reclaim its 30-day high, SHIB price is billed for an imminent rally. With memecoins like Dogecoin, BONK, and TRUMP Leverage ETF applications now filed by asset managers, Shiba Inu may also join the list. Should this happen, it might set off SHIB as a mature token for institutional investors to gain more exposure. Ultimately, Shiba Inu has crucial dormant triggers that might set it apart in the coming weeks when activated.

40215948,https://coingape.com/?p=238507,1739321164,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,World Liberty Financial Launches Macro Strategic Reserve for Crypto Expansion,https://coingape.com/world-liberty-financial-launches-macro-strategic-reserve-for-crypto-expansion/,"World Liberty Financial (WLFI) has announced the launch of its Macro Strategy reserve, aimed at strengthening its position in the cryptocurrency market. The reserve will support major digital assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum while also helping the platform manage market risks. World Liberty Financial Launches Macro Strategic Reserve The Macro Strategy reserve is designed to provide financial stability for WLFI by diversifying its holdings across multiple digital assets. The initiative aims to mitigate market volatility and enhance the platform’s long-term sustainability. According to a statement posted on X , WLFI described the reserve as a way to create a “robust financial backbone” for the platform. The company believes this move will not only secure its ecosystem but also enable future investments in innovative blockchain projects. WLFI has been actively expanding its cryptocurrency portfolio since its launch in October 2024, with recent investments in Ethereum (ETH), Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), Ondo (ONDO), Chainlink (LINK), and USD Coin (USDC). The Macro Strategy reserve will be used to strengthen these holdings while also exploring new opportunities in the market. Collaboration with Financial Institutions The company is engaging with financial institutions to contribute tokenized assets to the reserve. According to WLFI, the contributed assets will be stored in publicly accessible wallets, allowing institutions to gain transparent exposure to the crypto market. A blog post released on Tuesday stated that WLFI is in discussions with several firms about integrating Ondo Finance’s tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) into its treasury reserves sparking a ONDO price surge . These include Short-Term U.S. Government Treasuries (OUSG) and U.S. Dollar Yield (USDY) tokens. This collaboration is part of WLFI’s broader goal to connect traditional finance with decentralized finance (DeFi). The company believes that by working with financial institutions, it can help bring traditional assets on-chain and increase the adoption of tokenized investments. Market Activity and Recent Developments WLFI has been on a crypto buying spree in recent months. However, the company’s token holdings recently dropped from over $360 million to approximately $38 million, following a series of transactions that sent assets to exchanges. The reason behind these transfers has not been publicly disclosed. Despite this, WLFI continues to position itself as a major player in the DeFi sector. The company’s ties to former U.S. President Donald Trump have sparked discussions about potential conflicts of interest, but WLFI has not directly addressed these concerns. Concurrently, the World Liberty Financial has purchased 1,917 ETH ($5 million) and 830,469 MOVE tokens ($470,000), according to blockchain data tracker.
