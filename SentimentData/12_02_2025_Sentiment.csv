Unlike tokens relying purely on market speculation, MUTM offers decentralized lending and borrowing features within a structured ecosystem. This framework incorporates peer-to-peer lending, a stablecoin pegged to on-chain collateral, and a buy-and-distribute system intended to promote steady token value over time. Currently available in its initial presale phase at $0.01, MUTM provides early adopters an opportunity to acquire tokens before a series of 11 presale stages lifts the price to $0.06 at launch. Many analysts anticipate a significant uptick in MUTM’s valuation once the token is listed, pointing to it as an undervalued project that could eventually rival XRP and Solana. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Stands Out Mutuum Finance is set to make a lasting mark in decentralized finance by prioritizing real-world functionality rather than speculative hype. Through the platform, users can either generate passive returns by lending assets or secure crypto-backed loans without liquidating their holdings. Two lending models—Peer-to-Contract (P2C) for automated terms and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) for direct negotiations—ensure diverse and adaptable borrowing options. Central to Mutuum Finance’s roadmap is its planned stablecoin, fully backed by collateral and deployed on Ethereum. This stablecoin aims to broaden lending possibilities while minimizing volatility. In contrast to protocols reliant on off-chain reserves, Mutuum Finance provides transparent minting via deposited collateral. With security at the forefront, all smart contracts will undergo audits by an established firm. During this first presale stage, tokens are priced at $0.01, climbing up to $0.06 by the final round. Over 7 million tokens have already been sold, raising more than $70,000 from investors eager to lock in these discounted rates. To help stabilize MUTM’s value and mitigate extreme price swings, the project has implemented a buy-and-distribute mechanic. A portion of fees collected from lending and borrowing is used to purchase MUTM tokens on the open market, which are then distributed to mtToken stakers. This approach not only encourages long-term holding but also applies regular buy pressure on the token, potentially leading to a steadier price trajectory after launch. Mutuum Finance’s beta platform is slated to go live alongside its listing on exchanges, allowing token holders to immediately engage with the lending and borrowing services. This eliminates much of the uncertainty that accompanies pre-product launches in the crypto space and fosters a sense of reliability among investors. Additionally, Mutuum Finance is hosting a $100,000 giveaway for early participants, with ten winners each receiving $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. Interested users can enter by following the project’s official channels and performing specific tasks. On Track to Rival Established Projects With an actionable roadmap, a rapidly growing community, and tangible DeFi use cases, Mutuum Finance offers a compelling alternative to more established tokens like XRP and Solana. As its presale continues to gather momentum, the project’s utility-focused design and built-in mechanisms for sustaining price stability position MUTM as an undervalued opportunity well worth considering. Early adopters who secure tokens now could potentially see significant returns as the platform moves closer to its full-scale launch.

This impressive rally has positioned Litecoin as one of the top-performing altcoins during a period of market uncertainty. Analysts and investors are now speculating about the potential for a massive breakout in the coming weeks as Litecoin continues to show relative strength compared to other cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Cardano Is Showing Signs Of A Potential Rebound As Key Indicator Flashes A Buy Signal – Analyst Top analyst BigCheds shared a detailed technical analysis, revealing that Litecoin is approaching daily range peaks and gearing up to test multi-year highs around the $145 mark. This key resistance level has been a critical zone for Litecoin in previous cycles, and breaking above it could signal the start of a significant upward trend. Litecoin’s recent momentum has caught the attention of both retail and institutional investors, who are watching closely for signs of a confirmed breakout. With the broader market still consolidating, Litecoin’s ability to outperform could set the stage for a bullish continuation, potentially taking the price to new heights. As the crypto market braces for its next move, Litecoin’s price action remains a focal point for traders. Breaking past the $145 level would solidify its bullish narrative and pave the way for further gains. Litecoin Prepares For A Breakout Litecoin has shown impressive relative strength, surging over 30% in the past week, while the broader market continues to face indecision. This notable performance has captured the attention of analysts and investors, with some expecting Litecoin to lead a bullish rally that could break multi-year highs and push into higher supply levels. However, caution remains among market experts, as the current price action could result in a fake breakout. Top analyst BigCheds shared a technical analysis on X, revealing that Litecoin is approaching daily range peaks. According to him, the key level to watch is around $145, a critical resistance zone that has acted as a barrier in the past. BigCheds stated that while the price momentum is promising, he remains skeptical until Litecoin can decisively clear this level and hold it as support. The next few days will be crucial for Litecoin as altcoins across the market are finding support, and Bitcoin flirts with reclaiming the $100K mark. If Litecoin can sustain its momentum and break above the $145 level, it could solidify its position as one of the leading altcoins in the current market cycle. Conversely, failing to clear this key level could lead to a retracement, testing lower support zones. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Multi-Year Bullish Pattern – Expert Suggests The Next Move Will Be ‘The Real Deal’ As the market watches closely, Litecoin’s ability to hold above recent gains and break past resistance will likely dictate its direction in the coming weeks. Whether this move is the start of a bullish rally or another fake-out remains to be seen, but its price action is undoubtedly setting the stage for significant market moves. LTC Testing Crucial Supply Levels Litecoin (LTC) is trading at $127 after experiencing a strong bullish surge, climbing over 23% in less than two days. The recent price action has been impressive, as LTC reclaimed range highs and successfully pushed above the critical $120 mark. This move has shifted market sentiment, placing significant pressure on bears as the price approaches the next key resistance zones at $140 and $145. The $140 and $145 levels represent crucial supply zones that have historically acted as barriers to further upward movement. A breakout above these levels would not only signal a continuation of the bullish trend but also set the stage for Litecoin to test its multi-year high at $147. Analysts believe that reclaiming and holding above this level would trigger a massive rally, potentially propelling LTC into uncharted territory. Related Reading: Solana Holds Support Above Key Indicator – Expert Sees Push To ATH If Momentum Returns However, the coming days will be critical for Litecoin’s price trajectory. Bulls need to maintain momentum and defend current levels to sustain this upward move. If LTC successfully breaks above $147, it could attract more buyers, fueling further gains. Conversely, failing to clear these resistance levels could lead to consolidation or a minor retracement before another attempt at a breakout. All eyes are now on Litecoin as it approaches a decisive phase.

With its presale concluded, the spotlight moves to future market possibilities. Traders involved in the best crypto presale for 5thScape are now scouting for another prospect that promises robust returns and long-term growth potential.

As a result, the recent Bitcoin dip resulted in established projects like Cardano and meme coins like PEPE witnessing a market downturn. Therefore, investors are rotating to PropiChain as the next big opportunity with the potential to outperform other projects. This text will look into the Bitcoin price dip and how it sets PropiChain up for an explosive upside trajectory. The Bitcoin Price and its Impact on Cardano (ADA), PEPE, and PropiChain (PCHAIN) On the 2nd of this month, the Bitcoin price action dipped and was trading around the $92k range. This correction was a reaction to the global trade conflicts on import tariffs. Before the BTC dip, ADA was trading above $0.8, and following Bitcoin’s decline, it almost lost the $0.6 support level. PEPE, on the other hand, was at an $18 billion market cap at some point last month. Following the decline, it lost the $4 billion market cap support and has been trying to regain it. Even though the Bitcoin price has exceeded the $100k mark more than 3 times since its decline, PEPE and ADA are still struggling to regain momentum. Amid the Bitcoin price correction, PCHAIN’s presale keeps witnessing a massive inflow of investors. More than $2.5 million has been raised, and it is believed to be the best token presale in 2025. It is currently going for a low entry price of $0.011 in the second stage of its presale, which is set to increase by more than 100% in the third round. Here Are Some Offerings of PropiChain that is Driving the Hype Around the Project PropiChain’s proposed revolution in the real estate industry will benefit both existing and intending investors. The featured artificial intelligence, for instance, touches almost all aspects of the industry. It can help you get an asset that matches your investment goals. For instance, using the advanced filter tools returns recommendations closer to what you want. Potential ROI, substantial rental income, etc., can be your filter search keyword to suggest properties with increasing values or those suitable for rental. The PropiChain AI also offers predictive market analysis; therefore, making the right choice from the recommended assets is certain. It can do this by analyzing all the applicable data, such as past and present price performances, market trends, and other economic factors. Even if the property of your interest is on foreign soil, reaching the seller, inspecting, and acquiring it is possible remotely. PropiChain will integrate the 3D Metaverse environment to enable virtual meetings amongst international buyers and sellers. When it’s time to inspect, the 3D representation gives detailed information. Touring in an interactive environment is better than pictures and more cost-effective compared to flying abroad to inspect in person. All these ensure PropiChain investors experience advanced real estate early. Activities like leasing, lease renewal, and rental payment can be programmed. Thanks to smart contracts on PropiChain , you can set lease terms, and once you and your lessee reach a consensus, a legally binding contract can be formed without needing bulky legal papers. These smart contracts can further notify the landlord and tenants of the need to renew their agreement. The simple process involves the lessee agreeing to the updated terms sent by the smart contracts and instant renewal is processed. It can also be programmed to renew the lease once the terms agreed are met. The exact process can automate monthly rentals, and payments will be processed from users’ wallet balances. Unlike traditional financial services, payment is swift on PropiChain’s decentralized platform, and there is no need for long, unnecessary processing. Why PropiChain Will Outperform Cardano and PEPE Unlike PEPE, which thrives on speculative trading, and ADA, which is struggling with momentum, The real life application of PCHAIN is revolutionary and backed by a trillion-dollar sector. Being able to influence an ever-booming real estate industry is one of the many reasons experts believe so much in PropiChain . It has also raised over $2.5 million as the second presale increased momentum. This makes it an ideal choice for investors who want projects that can replicate the Bitcoin price 2013 surge. The early listing on CoinMarketCap has increased the project’s visibility in the global crypto market. Therefore, experts are forecasting it could deliver 30000% by early Q2 2025. Conclusion The BlockAudit positive report on PCHAIN is another testament to the legitimacy of this token. This report confirmed the security system is solid, and protecting investors’ assets is a top priority of the project. With this confirmation, smart investors are participating more with enhanced confidence. The Bitcoin price drops, but PropiChain maintains its increasing traction across the crypto world. Stage one investors are already in profit from the presale increase in value. The $0.011 will soon increase in the 3rd presale stage. Making now the best time to join. With the forecasted 30,000%, an investment of $1000 in this round could potentially yield $300k by early Q2 2025. Join now to position for a project that can replicate the Bitcoin price action early days surge in a few weeks.

In 2025, the buzz around certain presales is palpable, with Web3Bay leading the pack thanks to its unique decentralized e-commerce platform. Alongside Web3Bay, 5thScape and MEMEX are quickly making names for themselves as the top presale crypto projects to watch. Here’s a deeper dive into why these three crypto projects should be on your radar this week. 1. Web3Bay – The Top Presale Crypto Project Right Now Web3Bay shines in the presale arena, introducing a decentralized marketplace that aims to overhaul conventional e-commerce. The platform empowers users to manage their data and transactions securely, reflecting the increasing demand for privacy and safety online. Since the start of its presale, Web3Bay has collected over $1.1 million, selling 295 million tokens at $0.004562625 each. Currently, in Stage 4 of its presale, Web3Bay is gearing up for price hikes in subsequent phases of its 28-stage rollout. Early participants could see substantial gains, with the final token price projected at $0.1959. Given the solid investor interest and rising demand, Web3Bay’s presale could deliver returns similar to past blockchain successes, where early backers achieved gains ranging from 100 to 1,000 times their initial investment. Web3Bay sets itself apart from fleeting meme-centric projects by focusing on real-world utility and sustainable development, aiming to deliver real value to both individual users and businesses within its network. That’s why Web3Bay is highlighted as a top choice among presale crypto projects, promising significant long-term benefits following its official launch. 2. 5thScape – Pioneering the Future of VR and Metaverse A key project among the top presale crypto projects is 5thScape, which blends blockchain with virtual reality (VR). This initiative has already secured over $9.4 million, focusing on revolutionizing gaming, healthcare, and education through a VR ecosystem that lets users earn from their time in digital domains. 5thScape is set to become a significant force in both the metaverse and VR industries, which are expanding quickly. As it moves into new sectors, investors are eyeing considerable growth opportunities. Anticipation for 5thScape’s listings on exchanges like MEXC and BitMart is high, positioning it as a vital presale to monitor in the near future. 3. Meme Index – Broadening Meme Coin Investment Horizons The allure of meme coins has grown, yet the risk involved with individual investments remains high. MEMEX introduces a solution by offering a diversified portfolio of meme coins, enabling investors to manage risk by spreading investments across several assets, rather than relying on a single coin. Already attracting substantial attention, MEMEX offers staking and governance to token holders, presenting a less volatile entry into the meme coin market. For those seeking to mitigate risks while still tapping into the meme coin sector’s growth, MEMEX stands out as an appealing choice in top presale crypto projects, with proven scalability in the bustling meme coin arena. Key Crypto Presales to Watch Crypto presales provide an exclusive chance for investors to enter projects at early stages, often at prices well below eventual market rates. Web3Bay, 5thScape, and MEMEX are three diverse ventures offering unique entry points into different facets of the crypto world. Web3Bay is at the forefront with its decentralized marketplace and strong presale traction, aiming for long-term viability and substantial returns as it evolves. 5thScape, meanwhile, is carving out a leadership position in the virtual economy through its blockchain-enabled VR experiences. MEMEX, on the other hand, makes investing in meme coins simpler and safer with its diversified token basket, helping investors mitigate risk while still enjoying the sector’s growth potential. For those eager to invest early in promising ventures, these presales offer a chance to secure a position at the foundation, with the potential for hefty gains as the projects mature. However, thorough due diligence is always advised before making any investment decisions. If you’re considering diversifying your portfolio, Web3Bay, 5thScape, and MEMEX are worth a closer look this week.

Now, after three straight months of Bitcoin (BTC) dominance, it seems the altcoin market is ready to push back with a major inflow of investments into the sector. However, what’s most interesting from this altcoin rally are the lucrative opportunities expected to emerge, like the 22,000% explosion of the PropiChain (PCHAIN) AI altcoin, which powers a game-changing blockchain solution for the $634 trillion real estate industry. Bitcoin (BTC) Rally Slows Down: Is It Time For Altcoins to Shine? Bitcoin (BTC) took the market by storm over Q4 2024, running from $60k to $100k, making and breaking new all-time highs over the shortest span of its history. However, the same couldn’t be said for altcoins. When Bitcoin (BTC) was $60k, Ethereum (ETH) was $3k. Then BTC hit $80k, but ETH remained at $3k. BTC then set a new all-time high of $108k, and to much surprise, Ethereum failed to pump, sitting at $3k levels. While strange, analysts say the reason for this was a mega Bitcoin FOMO, which saw governments, institutions, and retail traders race to secure their spot early before BTC began its journey to $1m. But recent charts show a major Bitcoin (BTC) rejection , indicating that the hype is dying down, which will make way for altcoins to capitalize. Now begs the question: which altcoin is the best to buy now? Surprisingly, established altcoins have been displaced by the PropiChain (PCHAIN) AI altcoin, which could outperform the market in Q1 with a 22,000% run. PropiChain (PCHAIN) Real Estate Solutions Attracts 22,000% Rally for its AI Altcoin PropiChain (PCHAIN) isn’t just making an impact; it’s rewriting the rules of the $634 trillion real estate market while simultaneously revolutionizing Web3 and AI-powered investing. By merging blockchain with artificial intelligence, PropiChain is dismantling financial barriers, injecting liquidity into an industry notorious for its rigidity, and reshaping how properties are bought, sold, and managed. While PropiChain offers a suite of groundbreaking innovations, its AI investment solutions are emerging as the ultimate game-changer. The platform’s intelligent algorithms eliminate inefficiencies, streamline complex transactions, and introduce automation that the real estate sector has never seen before. PCHAIN token holders gain an edge with always-on AI assistance, instant property appraisals, predictive analytics, and real-time investment insights. PropiChain’s auto-trading functionality allows investors to capitalize on profitable deals 24/7 – executing high-value transactions even in their sleep. Yet, the most disruptive feature is PropiChain’s fractional ownership model , which levels the playing field in an industry historically reserved for the ultra-wealthy. PropiChain allows anyone to own a stake in high-value properties by tokenizing real estate on a secure blockchain, unlocking opportunities that were once out of reach. For as little as $100, investors can secure a 0.01% share in a $1 million asset, turning real estate from an illiquid, slow-moving investment into a liquid, tradeable asset. This seismic shift reduces transaction times from the industry-standard 44 days to mere minutes and drives an influx of capital that could reshape the global property market. PropiChain’s innovation doesn’t stop there. Its metaverse marketplace takes real estate into the digital age, offering virtual property tours, staging tools for design experimentation, and a seamless, borderless trading experience. Paired with smart contracts that automate rent collection, lease renewals, and management tasks, PropiChain (PCHAIN) is cementing itself as the definitive Web3 platform for the future of real estate. Security & Credibility: Two Powerful Reasons to Bet on PropiChain With so many crypto projects failing to meet basic security standards, investors are right to be cautious. That’s why PropiChain’s recent BlockAudit certification is so important. Known for its uncompromising audits, BlockAudit meticulously reviewed PropiChain’s smart contracts and security framework, finding no weaknesses or hidden risks. This stamp of approval assures investors that their funds are protected on a fully secure and transparent platform. Adding to this credibility boost, PropiChain has now been listed on CoinMarketCap , a key milestone that puts it in front of millions of investors worldwide. Visibility on this leading crypto tracking site signals that PropiChain is a legitimate and rapidly growing force in blockchain real estate. PropiChain Presale Surges as the Bitcoin Market Dominance Wanes PropiChain (PCHAIN) is emerging as the first commercially viable blockchain solution for real estate, set to redefine how properties are tokenized, traded, stored, and managed. With the real estate industry on the brink of a blockchain-driven transformation, the PCHAIN presale presents a rare opportunity to invest in a project poised to outshine much of the crypto market in 2025. Currently, in round two, PCHAIN is priced at just $0.01, which is the lowest it will ever be. Savvy investors are quietly accumulating their positions, recognizing that this stage offers the highest upside potential before prices rise. However, the tide is shifting fast, considering the sheer profit potential. Today’s modest $1,250 investment could grow to a staggering $275,000 by the end of Q1 as the Bitcoin (BTC) market dominance wanes. Early Bitcoin (BTC) holders especially know that opportunities like this don’t come twice. PropiChain will never be this undervalued again, and those who hesitate risk missing out on what could be a once-in-a-lifetime wealth-building event.

Other countries signed the agreement which pledges to inclusive, open, and ethical development and deployment of the technology. However, the two countries believe there is too much emphasis on AI regulation, which is not healthy for the growth of the industry. The UK and US think otherwise According to BBC , a dozen other countries including China, France, and India, signed the AI declaration which is meant to support AI safety. The UK, in a brief statement revealed that it had not added its name to the list due to concerns about national security and “global governance.” Earlier, US Vice President JD Vance told delegates in Paris that too much regulation on the technology could “kill a transformative industry just as it’s taking off.” He added the technology was an opportunity that the Trump administration would not want to waste, adding pro-growth AI policies should be prioritized over safety. This is in sharp contrast to what the French President Emmanuel Macron said as he supported the need for further regulation. “We need these rules for AI to move forward.” President Macron. Vice President Vance’s comments also conflict with the position that UK previously held as it championed AI safety. The then prime minister Rishi Sunak held the first global AI Safety Summit in November 2023. The UK government revealed in a statement that it “agreed with much of the leader’s declaration” yet felt it was lacking some parts. “We felt the declaration didn’t provide enough practical clarity on global governance, nor sufficiently address harder questions around national security and the challenge AI poses to it.” UK government spokesperson. A trade body representing businesses in the sector across the country, UKAI opines this is a step in the right direction. “UKAI cautiously welcomes the Government’s refusal to sign this statement as an indication that it will explore the more pragmatic solutions that UKAI has been calling for – retaining opportunities to work closely with our US partners.” UKAI CEO Tim Flagg. “While UKAI agrees that being environmentally responsible is important, we question how to balance this responsibility with the growing needs of the AI industry for more energy,” said Flagg. Is the UK undercutting its credibility? According to Andrew Dudfield, head of AI at Full Fact, a fact-checking organization said the UK’s decision to refuse to sign the agreement puts it in jeopardy. “By refusing to sign today’s international AI Action Statement the UK Government risks undercutting its hard-won credibility as a world leader for safe, ethical and trustworthy AI innovation,” he said. The Paris communique seeks to limit the digital divide by promoting accessibility to the AI technology. It also seeks to ensure AI development is “transparent,” “safe,” as well as “secure and trustworthy.” “Making AI sustainable for people and the planet,” is listed as a further priority. According to the BBC, the agreement also touches on AI energy use. Experts have warned that AI energy use could balloon to as much as what small countries require in years to come. “Looking at the summit declaration, it’s difficult to pinpoint what exactly in that statement the government disagrees with,” said Michael Birtwistle, associate director at the Ada Lovelace Institute. The UK has also insisted that the decision was not influenced by the Trump administration but purely guided by “our own national interest, ensuring the balance between opportunity and national security.” World over, executives, diplomats and policymakers have been considering methods to capture the economic benefits of the AI technology , while addressing its technology’s risks.

In a new announcement from Uniswap Labs, the firm says Unichain mainnet officially launched today according to plan. As per the announcement, Unichain will be a layer-2 optimized for decentralized finance (DeFi) transactions on Ethereum. Starting today, developers can use Unichain to begin deploying apps and building with stablecoins, and users of the new layer-2 can fund their wallet, launch tokens, play with new apps, provide liquidity and do swaps, according to the blog post. A post from Unichain to the social media platform X broke down the new chain’s advantages into three main points. “Unichain mainnet is live – Fast with low fees – Built for cross-chain liquidity – Prioritizes decentralization from day one You can now deploy DeFi apps, launch tokens, swap, provide liquidity, and more.” Within hours of launching, leading US crypto exchange Coinbase announced support for Unichain. “Coinbase Onramp is expanding to Unichain. Unichain users now have a seamless way to convert fiat-to-crypto, with fee-free USDC on-ramping available at launch. Unichain is a fast, decentralized Superchain L2 designed to be a home for DeFi and cross-chain liquidity.” Uniswap labs announced the launch of the mainnet last month. “Once the new system’s safety and stability are validated, mainnet will be open for everyone! Users will be able to bridge funds directly to the network, and applications supporting Unichain will go live.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The altcoin space took the most beating, with the global market cap experiencing one of its biggest devaluations on record. Last week, Bitcoin investors endured what Glassnode called an intense whipsaw in price action. The leading digital asset saw its price initially fall as low as $93k, after which it recovered briefly and rallied to $102k. Now, it is trading closer to $95k. 14-day Bitcoin price chart, since January 29. Source: Glassnode The realized losses recorded by Bitcoin investors during those choppy swings in price action is being touted as one of the largest of the current bull market cycle. Bitcoin investors see small respite despite losses Investors lost around $520M as the market sold off to $93k, making it one of the largest local capitulation events so far. In fact, only the losses locked in on August 5, 2023, during the yen-carry trade unwind, stand out as a larger one-day loss. The majority of realized losses were recorded by short-term holders, especially those who acquired their coins within the last month. Their willingness to sell at a loss hints at their sensitivity to price fluctuations. The volatile price action is, for the most part, a response to President Trump’s threat of tariffs applied to Canada, Mexico, and China, which provides an uncertain macro backdrop for investors as everyone watches the drama play out. Besides this, the persistent strength of the US dollar has contributed to a marginally stressed liquidity environment. Fortunately, even though the price of Bitcoin has fluctuated wildly in recent weeks, it has not strayed very far from its starting position during this cycle, so the choppy price action and generally sideways movement continue to prevail. This is thanks to the substantial uptick in liquidity entering Bitcoin and larger capital flows that are balancing the inertia of an increasingly large asset. The growing presence of a more resilient and patient group of holders has also contributed to the relative stability BTC prices are enjoying, even amidst the relatively unstable macro backdrop. Will the bull run ever reach the altcoin sector? While Bitcoin has not been immune to the volatility in the markets, Glassnode analysts believe it is doing relatively well. The same can not be said for the altcoin sector, which experienced significant sell-side pressure amidst the volatility as many assets struggled to achieve widespread adoption or product-market fit, presenting a more challenging market environment. This has led to a wide-scale collapse of token prices, with all altcoin sub-sectors underperforming Bitcoin in recent weeks. Using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) which projects the correlation of token returns into a two-dimensional space to analyze the downside price action, they found that the majority of ERC-20 tokens are densely clustered. What this means is that a good majority of altcoins had to deal with the same broad-based sell-off, without as much an unexplainable distinction between different sectors. In short, very few tokens were immune to the downside volatility as most of the market dipped at once. The magnitude of the dip becomes more apparent when examining the 14-day change in the global altcoin market cap. Over the last two weeks, $234B left the altcoin market cap. The altcoin market is essentially in a bear market, which is very interesting because as it stands, Bitcoin is having a good run and is not displaying the same relative weakness. This suggests a divergence is opening up between BTC and the rest of the digital asset landscape. Key support levels for Bitcoin have been identified at the Mean MVRV Z-Score of $96.3k and the short-term holder cost basis around $92.2k. Meanwhile, the outlook for the altcoin sector is more uncertain and less optimistic, with hopes of an altcoin market fading with its hemorrhaging valuation.

Now he needs a court order to get it back, according to a Monday filing in Delaware bankruptcy court. At the time Bartusek made the deposit, Solana was worth $31, putting his deposit’s value at around $63,700. Since then, Solana’s price has surged to $198, meaning his locked-up funds are worth $396,000 as of press time. According to the filing , FTX “knowingly and willingly” accepted the deposit. Now they’re telling Bartusek that he would need a court order to withdraw the funds. Bartusek’s issue began when he attempted a withdrawal request on October 22, 2023, from a crypto wallet linked to BTSE, another exchange. Instead of moving his 2,000 SOL to a different account, he accidentally deposited it into his old FTX account, which you’d think would have been frozen since the company was knee-deep in the middle of bankruptcy proceedings. But they weren’t, and by the time Bartusek realized the mistake, FTX’s legal team told him that his funds couldn’t be returned without a judge’s approval. Bankruptcy law prevents companies from distributing funds outside an approved court process, meaning even accidental deposits remain locked. Bartusek’s attorney, Jack Shrum, said that cases like these aren’t uncommon. “Some people utilize several different crypto wallets, so depositing into one wallet that happens to be in bankruptcy is not difficult to imagine,” he explained. Unfortunately, Bartusek isn’t the only one struggling to retrieve funds. Thousands of FTX users have been stuck in limbo since FTX collapsed in November 2022, with customer withdrawals frozen for over two years, waiting to see if they will ever recover their lost assets. FTX’s bankruptcy team finally started paying back some customers on Feb. 8. Under the FTX Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization, the company confirmed that initial distributions will begin on Feb. 18, but they apply only to creditors with approved claims in the Convenience Classes, meaning users who completed the pre-distribution requirements. Customers eligible for repayments should expect their funds within one to three business days from February 18. According to its official press announcement, FTX has transferred funds to BitGo and Kraken, which are acting as Distribution Service Providers. These companies will handle retail and institutional distributions in supported jurisdictions according to the bankruptcy plan.

This is in line with the acknowledgment of Grayscale’s Solana ETF application, which was made in the previous month. SEC ACKNOWLEDGES FILING FOR CANARY SPOT SOLANA ETF — Phoenix » PhoenixNews.io (@PhoenixNewsIO) February 11, 2025 The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has also initiated a comment period for a 21-day period. This will be followed by either approval, rejection, or an extension of the duration of review by the agency. The filing comes amidst a rising number of crypto-related ETFs aiming to gain state approval. Compared to the previous years, many expect a more favorable stance from the SEC compared. The application resembles one that was used for Bitcoin ETFs, which were previously approved. According to market analysts, Grayscale’s Solana ETF, which is slightly ahead in the process of review, may serve as a precedent for future ETF applications, including that of Canary. Institutional players enter the Solana ETF race Cboe BZX Exchange has also filed rule changes to list spot Solana ETFs from various issuers, such as 21Shares AG, Bitwise, Van Eck, and Canary Capital. The filings represent a notable move toward the introduction of the altcoin ETFs in the conventional financial markets. Franklin Templeton has also entered the race by filing documents for a Delaware Solana Trust. The firm had in the past reported a positive outlook on Solana regarding its growing adoption and use cases. Like other issuers, Franklin’s filing hints it could soon submit a full ETF application. Interest in Solana from institutions is still rising. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan, JPMorgan estimates that an approved Solana ETF could attract $3bn to $6bn in net assets within its first year. Some experts believe this will also fast-track the adoption of other altcoin ETFs, including XRP and Dogecoin. James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg ETF analysts, estimate a 70% chance of Solana ETFs receiving approval this year. They base their analysis on the SEC’s changing stance on digital assets.

Or, he might simply remain a billionaire. The answer depends on who you ask. According to startup founders and AI experts, the firm’s value estimates range from $1 billion to $150 billion. The mid-range puts the firm between $2 billion and $30 billion, placing Liang with his 84% stake among Asia’s wealthiest tech moguls, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index . DeepSeek shrouds its valuation in secrecy, leaving investors guessing Since the funding and revenue of DeepSeek are not openly available to the public, it has not been easy to come up with the correct value for the company. This company is privately owned, and according to the available information, it has been financed by Liang’s hedge fund trading proceeds. “It’s basically impossible to give a convincing answer here because it’s a secretive firm,” says Jeffrey Emanuel, the founder of Pastel Network. DeepSeek’s public relations have chosen to stay neutral and have not commented on the company’s valuation, leaving the competition for the sources of the estimates. AI specialists and startup founders have analyzed DeepSeek’s valuation. Glasswing Ventures Managing Partner Rudina Seseri values the company at a minimum of one billion dollars compared with other AI firms such as OpenAI and Anthropic. However, some, such as Chanakya Ramdev of Sweat Free Telecom, think that DeepSeek can be worth half of OpenAI’s $300 billion valuation but is higher than Nvidia’s Jensen Huang. The current discussions on DeepSeek’s valuation are being conducted at a time of surge in AI investment. For instance, Anthropic, an AI company supported by Amazon, is worth $60 billion, while Mistral AI from France is worth $6 billion. Comparisons have also been drawn with China’s Zhipu AI, valued at $3 billion. However, it is hard to determine the stability of this sector because it is volatile. Recently, Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, rejected a $97.4 billion bid from investors, including Elon Musk, to buyout OpenAI’s controlling nonprofit. DeepSeek’s impact goes beyond the guesswork of the value. The company has reversed the conventional wisdom on AI innovation, disrupting Silicon Valley’s primacy and fueling global shifts in AI power. It even spurred the biggest stock drop in Nvidia’s history, indicating the shift in the AI world. Liang Wenfeng builds an AI empire that challenges global markets Liang Wenfeng was born in 1985 in Zhanjiang, China, and graduated from Zhejiang University with a degree in electronic engineering before pursuing a master’s in information and communication engineering. Quantitative trading was his first career choice; he co-founded Zhejiang High-Flyer Asset Management, which at one point controlled $12 billion. Liang created DeepSeek in 2023 as an AI venture for his hedge fund, Zhejiang High-Flyer Asset Management, which Liang and two other engineers from Zhejiang University set up. The trio began trading as students during the global financial crisis. Despite the fact that the company is quite young, it has already been restricted by “hundreds” of companies, while governments from Australia to South Korea have also restricted access to government devices due to security concerns. When strategic investments start coming in from Chinese tech giants like Microsoft did with OpenAI, then DeepSeek’s value will be further solidified. According to Emanuel, even at what seems to be very high valuations, these investments could be very valuable in the long run. DeepSeek is currently an enigma, a company whose value is still unknown but one that has changed the AI investment landscape. The big question still remains: Will Liang Wenfeng keep on the path to becoming one of the richest people in the world, or will DeepSeek’s valuation be on the lower end of the estimate? Only time will tell.

This stance marks a notable shift from earlier considerations where the Federal Reserve had been exploring the potential of a digital dollar. No CBDC For The United States, Powell Confirms This declaration came during a recent Senate Banking Committee hearing on Tuesday when Powell responded to a direct question from Senator Bernie Moreno (R-OH). “Can I have your commitment that as long as you’re the chair of the Federal Reserve system, that we will never have a central bank digital currency?” Moreno asked. “Yes,” Powell responded. The Fed’s previous research on CBDCs aimed at understanding how such a currency might improve the current payment system’s efficiency and safety. Critics of CBDCs, including the Cato Institute’s Nicholas Anthony, have praised Powell’s commitment, citing potential risks to financial freedom, privacy, and market stability. Unlike decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, a CBDC would be government-issued and regulated, potentially leading to concerns over surveillance due to its trackable nature. This announcement comes at a time when several countries are actively experimenting with their own digital currencies. Notably, China’s digital yuan pilot started in 2020, with other nations like Russia, Turkey, and Japan also exploring similar initiatives. Republicans Stopping CBDCs Powell’s firm stance highlights a divergence in U.S. policy compared to these global trends, especially under the current U.S. administration led by President Trump. Senator Moreno specifically praised Powell’s stance since it meant the U.S. wouldn’t wind up “looking like China” in any way. The debate around CBDCs in the U.S. has seen significant political pushback, especially from Republican lawmakers who have called for bans on government-issued digital currencies. Last year, the House of Representatives passed a bil l from Congressman Tom Emmer to ban the Federal Reserve from issuing a CBDC. In his recent crypto executive order , President Donald Trump also prohibited Federal agencies from attempting to promote or issue a CBDC. Powell’s clear statement might provide some relief to those concerned about the implications of CBDCs on personal freedoms and privacy.

Under the Republican-led subcommittee's title ""A Golden Age of Digital Assets,"" the industry representatives showed up in the hearing with momentum at all levels of the federal government, including from the White House, whose crypto czar was the one to first utter the ""golden age"" phrase . Just over two years after the devastation of collapsing crypto lenders and the criminal implosion of FTX in 2022, the industry has proven its sharp recovery with a slate of lawmakers clearly on-board for the legislation the industry has been calling for. ""Under the Trump administration, we will course correct by creating a workable pathway for responsible digital asset companies to set up operations here in the United States,"" said Representative Bryan Steil, a Wisconsin Republican who chairs the subcommittee that's an offshoot of the House Financial Services Committee. Republicans on the panel decried the ""unpredictable and hostile approach"" to crypto of former President Joe Biden's administration (as Steil put it), with an executive branch that's already reversing some of those past policies at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Securities and Exchange Commission. But the holy grail for the industry is a wide-reaching bill like the one passed in the House in the previous session of Congress. ""There are many issues to debate over the next several years, but we need to move now and put that basic foundation in place,"" said Jonathan Jachym, a lawyer and global head of policy at U.S. exchange Kraken. Among the hearing's witnesses was Timothy Massad, a former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission when it first flagged bitcoin (BTC) as a commodity. He cautioned the lawmakers not to push too hard into the details as they craft their digital assets market-structure legislation, because he said the CFTC and the SEC are more expert in the minutiae it'll require, and the agency leaders should be the ones to work out the technical aspects. This was the first hearing of the digital assets panel during this new Congress, but other committees in both chambers have already been digging into crypto-heavy issues, such as debanking. Earlier on Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell agreed that debanking is a problem worth exploring , and he also agreed that the Fed wouldn't be chasing a central bank digital currency on his watch. While Republicans and the industry witnesses bashed the Biden administration's track record, Dems took the opportunity to criticize President Donald Trump for embracing crypto for his personal gain by backing memecoin $TRUMP, which they characterized as a ""crypto scam"" that presents a dangerous conflict and may violate the constitutional provision against federal officials seeking profit from their office.",Policy|U.S. Congress|House Financial Services Committee|Donald Trump|crypto legislation,EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|BTC|FIAT|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-11 23:23:43

Crytpo custodian BitGo is considering an IPO as soon as the second half of this year, joining a flood of companies in the sector anticipating more support for their plans from regulators. https://t.co/oxu8e9lSaL — Bloomberg (@business) February 11, 2025 Citing sources familiar with the matter, the company is in discussions with potential advisors to prepare for a public listing—a move that would mark a major milestone for a firm that has long been synonymous with institutional-grade cryptocurrency security. Founded in 2013, the firm is known for multi-signature and threshold signature technologies. BitGo serves more than 1,500 institutional clients across 50 countries. The firm’s services include regulated custody, trading, lending, and DeFi solutions, making it a critical infrastructure provider for the digital asset market. According to sources, an IPO would not only offer liquidity to early investors but also supply the company with fresh capital to expand its product offerings in a competitive sector. Optimism in the Crypto Industry The potential public debut comes amid a wave of optimism in the crypto industry, as a growing number of firms anticipate regulatory support for their listing plans. Recent developments suggest that regulators may adopt a more accommodating stance toward crypto companies, providing the kind of clarity that has been lacking in recent years. Industry analysts believe that an IPO from a well-established player like BitGo would signal maturity in the crypto market. As the company finalizes its discussions with advisors and prepares the necessary documentation, market participants are keenly anticipating further updates on the timing and valuation of the offering. BitGo Introduces Institutional Bitcoin Staking with Core DAO In a joint announcement on December 9, 2024, BitGo stated that it would be one of the first custodians to facilitate institutional access to dual staking with Core DAO, allowing clients to earn returns on their Bitcoin holdings. @BitGo has introduced institutional-grade Bitcoin staking through a partnership with @Coredao_Org , a layer-1 blockchain platform. #BitGo #CoreDAO https://t.co/PTFF8ynr2T — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 10, 2024 The staking mechanism enables institutions to maintain full custody of their assets, mitigating counterparty risks often associated with traditional staking methods. As BitGo moves toward a public listing, its success or failure could influence how other crypto firms approach capital markets. A strong debut might encourage more institutional investment, while challenges could highlight the hurdles the industry still faces. Either way, this IPO will be closely watched as a potential benchmark for crypto’s place in traditional finance.

Its aggressive token burn strategy, unique presale structure, and skyrocketing investor interest make it a must-watch.

The Tokyo-listed online mobile gaming firm intends to strengthen its position in cryptocurrency by using Bitcoin for blockchain staking. Gumi Joins Babylon Staking According to reports, the company’s board of directors approved the decision as part of its strategy to expand its blockchain node operation business. This move positions Gumi as a key player in Japan’s growing Web3 industry. Following this development, Gumi will become the first publicly listed Japanese company to serve as a validator in the Babylon staking protocol. This role will enable the company to earn rewards while contributing to blockchain security. In a statement, Gumi emphasized that the investment would help strengthen its blockchain operations and increase its influence in the Web3 space. The company also confirmed that it would closely monitor its Bitcoin holdings and update its financial records accordingly. “ Through this initiative, we aim to further strengthen our node operation business and enhance our presence in the Web3 domain,” Gumi stated. Interestingly, Gumi’s stock price rose following the announcement. According to Google Finance data, its shares increased by 3.6%, reaching ¥454 (about $3) after the news broke. Asian Companies Continue to Adopt Bitcoin Gumi’s decision reiterates a growing trend of Asian businesses investing in cryptocurrency. In December 2024, Japanese energy and consulting firm Remixpoint added $1.38 million worth of Bitcoin to its portfolio, increasing its total crypto holdings to $27.59 million. Meanwhile, Tokyo-listed Metaplanet saw a sharp rise in its stock value after adopting a Bitcoin standard in April 2024. The company now aims to acquire 21,000 BTC by 2026. Expanding Institutional Cryptocurrency Network Amid Regulatory Actions Notably, as more entities explore Bitcoin and blockchain staking, institutional interest in cryptocurrency is rising in Japan. Gumi’s latest move reveals its confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential and the broader Web3 industry. At the same time, Japan is tightening regulations on unregistered crypto exchanges. Last week, Apple removed crypto trading apps like Bybit, Bitget, MEXC, KuCoin, and Bitcastle from its Japan store. This action followed multiple warnings from Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA), urging these platforms to comply with local regulations or leave the market.

Save More with Web3Bay’s Crypto Payments Thinking of crypto payments only in terms of trading? Time to reconsider. Web3Bay is transforming online purchasing with its Web3 payment system. Here, users enjoy speedy transactions and no hidden fees, alongside exclusive discounts when using cryptocurrencies such as XRP, BNB, or other supported coins. This means more of your money is spent on your actual purchases rather than going to intermediaries. Moreover, Web3Bay’s presale is drawing interest due to its accessible starting price and potential for substantial returns. The platform has already secured over $1.1 million, pricing its 3BAY token at just $0.004562 in the fourth presale stage. With plans to launch the token at $0.1959, early backers could see significant gains once it begins trading. Unlike traditional e-commerce sites that take a portion of every sale, Web3Bay’s approach rewards its users, allowing them to keep more of their money. The evolution towards Web3 payments is making conventional shopping seem outdated. Web3Bay offers consumers direct control over their finances, bypassing traditional banks and payment processors. The possibility of paying with major cryptocurrencies like XRP while enjoying discounts and seamless transactions places Web3Bay in a favorable position. As the platform expands, early adopters are set to benefit the most, leaving those who stick with old methods paying more at traditional outlets. XRP Crypto: Solid Market Performance with Practical Use XRP is not just for trading anymore. Currently priced at around $2.98, XRP has experienced significant growth, driven by positive expectations regarding regulatory outcomes and broader adoption. Some experts anticipate its value could reach between $5 and $7, with more optimistic projections suggesting it could surpass $10. The excitement surrounding Ripple’s developments and the increasing demand for quick, cost-effective blockchain solutions have made XRP a hot topic in the financial community. Moreover, XRP excels in Web3 payment applications. Thanks to its fast transaction times and minimal fees, it’s perfect for use on platforms like Web3Bay, where users can complete payments instantly without any deductions from intermediaries. As Web3 payments gain traction, the practical applications for XRP are expected to expand, benefiting those who invest early. Binance Coin: A Valuable Payment and Utility Asset Binance Coin (BNB) maintains its status as a leading cryptocurrency, with its current trading price near $670. Despite some price volatility, it continues to be a preferred choice for transactions on the Binance exchange and beyond. Binance’s strategy of burning tokens to reduce supply, along with new features on the BNB Chain introduced by PancakeSwap, keeps the demand for BNB robust. In December 2024, it reached a peak of $794, indicating its potential for future growth. BNB also plays a crucial role in Web3 payments. On platforms like Web3Bay, users benefit from Binance Coin and XRP for fast, fee-free transactions. As more online retailers adopt cryptocurrency payments, BNB’s advantages in reducing costs and speeding up transactions make it an appealing option for digital shoppers. Wrapping Up Both XRP and Binance Coin (BNB) are proving their worth beyond mere trading. XRP is becoming popular as an efficient, affordable option for transactions, with future price potential ranging from $5 to $10. Binance Coin is also asserting its utility, currently valued at around $670, supported by ongoing demand due to Binance’s strategic token burns and ecosystem enhancements. The real transformation is occurring in Web3 payments . Web3Bay illustrates how cryptocurrencies can extend beyond asset holding — they can also streamline purchasing, eliminate hidden costs, and enable immediate transactions. With the 3BAY token presale ongoing, early participants are poised to gain the most before the platform fully launches.

Currently, DOT’s price is $4.61, with predictions ranging from $4.81 to $18.01 for 2025. On the other hand, LINK stands at $18.96, with forecasts suggesting a rise to between $25 and $100, influenced by DeFi integration and large-scale purchases. Both are garnering interest, yet there’s another exciting option available. BlockDAG (BDAG) introduces a straightforward method to profit from crypto. Skip the trading and mining—BlockDAG’s affiliate program instantly pays 5% USDT cashback for each referral purchase.

Predicting Polkadot’s Future: Upcoming DOT Price Ranges Polkadot is now priced at $4.61, experiencing some resistance as the market anticipates its next direction. Analysts predict a DOT price range from $4.81 to $18.01 by 2025, influenced by adoption rates and general market trends. While its short-term path is unclear, DOT’s significance in enabling multichain interoperability keeps it central in the crypto dialogue. Looking ahead, DOT might challenge the $14.04 mark as a crucial resistance point, with potential to reach up to $18.01 if positive momentum continues. The trajectory largely hinges on the expansion of Polkadot’s ecosystem and market confidence. As traders ponder DOT’s potential, platforms like BlockDAG are drawing interest by offering passive rewards, presenting an alternative to price-dependent strategies. For now, the focus remains on identifying DOT’s next significant movement. Chainlink’s Future Trajectory: Updated Price Insights Chainlink is trading at $18.96 and currently under scrutiny as significant holders recently sold off 23 million LINK tokens, totaling about $455 million. Despite these sales, signs of accumulation are visible, with declining LINK balances on exchanges suggesting potential price resilience. Analysts are split on Chainlink’s future, estimating a 2025 price range from $25 to $100, dictated by its adoption in the DeFi sector. Long-term outlooks are more optimistic, with predictions for 2030 ranging from $48 to $100, assuming Chainlink continues leading as a trusted oracle provider. Short-term price movements will depend on overall market dynamics and the demand for its technology. While the market awaits a definitive trend, those seeking simpler gains are exploring BlockDAG, known for its direct rewards rather than speculative investment. The Bottom Line Current forecasts place Polkadot’s DOT price between $4.81 and $18.01, whereas Chainlink’s potential shift for 2025 could span from $25 to $100. Both projects maintain solid fundamentals, yet their future prices are not guaranteed. As traders monitor the movements of DOT and LINK, BlockDAG presents a distinctive offering—immediate rewards without relying on market fluctuations. BlockDAG’s affiliate scheme allows users to earn directly from crypto without the need to trade or mine. Each referral results in a 5% instant USDT cashback (BEP-20), with no ceiling on potential earnings.

This development is outlined in the 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which reveal the firm’s escalated commitment to digital asset investments. Goldman Sachs Expands Crypto Portfolio, Adds $1.5B in Bitcoin ETFs According to a recent SEC filing , Goldman Sachs has significantly increased its investments in Bitcoin ETFs. The report details an 88% increase in the firm’s holdings in the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), bringing its investment to $1.27 billion. This uptick is part of a broader strategy by Goldman Sachs to deepen its footprint in the digital assets space. The filing also highlights a substantial growth in Goldman’s holdings of the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), with a 105% increase compared to the previous quarter. This growth has boosted the FBTC position to a value of $288 million. These developments reflect a confident move by the bank to leverage the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies. In addition to these holdings, Goldman Sachs CEO, David Solomon, recently dismissed Bitcoin as a threat to the US dollar’s dominance. He reiterated that Bitcoin remains a speculative asset, emphasizing its volatility and uncertain regulatory landscape. Regulatory Filings Illuminate Investment Trends Goldman Sachs’ latest 13F filings provide a window into the firm’s investment tactics. The filings reveal a strategic embrace of Bitcoin ETFs among its asset management practices. These filings are mandatory for institutional investment managers with equity assets over $100 million, offering a periodic overview of their holdings. Goldman’s increasing investments in BTC ETFs coincide with the ongoing development of regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies. This trend suggests a strong institutional belief in the long-term viability of digital assets. The firm’s strategic positioning also includes the use of derivatives such as calls and puts, showcasing a refined strategy for managing crypto exposure. Market Implications of Crypto Strategy Goldman Sachs’ diversified approach to its digital asset portfolio enhances its market standing and sets a benchmark for other institutional investors considering crypto expansions. More so, CEO David Solomon has outlined conditions for Goldman Sachs to expand into crypto markets . He stressed the need for regulatory changes. Solomon confirmed the firm has built infrastructure around digital assets. However, legal constraints block direct trading of Bitcoin and Ethereum. In related news, the US SEC is actively reviewing BlackRock’s proposal for in-kind Bitcoin ETF redemptions, which could enhance market liquidity and reduce transaction costs. If approved, this change would allow authorized participants to receive Bitcoin directly instead of cash during redemptions.

Despite this, onchain signs of Shiba Inu whale return signal positive long-term prospects for the memecoin. At the time of writing, the SHIB price changed hands for $0.00001574, which was down marginally by 0.54% in 24 hours. With the whale swooping in, the token might be setting the pace for a new rally. Shiba Inu Whales Might Make the Difference According to data insight from IntoTheBlock, Shiba Inu whale transactions have jumped by 20.69% in 24 hours. Based on this rally, the large transactions amount to $26.66 million within the time under review. Per the data, 80 SHIB whale transactions have been registered over 24 hours. This figure marks an average from the weekly low of 42 transactions and a high of 185. Per volume, more than 1.69 trillion SHIB tokens were moved by the traders initiating the large transactions. While the 7-day high stood at 5.84 trillion SHIB, the lowest recorded figure comes in at 890.85 billion SHIB. Shiba Inu Whale Transactions. Source: IntoTheBlock It is worth noting that these whale transactions mark those worth at least $100,000. As spotted onchain, a SHIB whale moved over 3 trillion tokens a few days ago, sparking speculations. At a time when the price of Shiba Inu needs a viable anchor, massive shifts by SHIB whales might reshape sentiment. Shiba Inu Growing Footprint Despite ranking as the second-largest memecoin in the Web3 space, Shiba Inu has a bigger community of builders. Through Shibarium, the token has continued to expand its footprint. As reported recently, the token expanded to UAE , partnering with the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure (MoEI). This collaboration helped expand the SHIB footprint and utilize its ShibOS to enhance the MoEI digital operations. In addition, the developer team is integrating new solutions like the Full Homorphobic Encryption (FHE) designed for privacy. This ecosystem push bordering on every aspect of its operations is pushing Shiba Inu as an attractive token to whales. If the trend is sustained, the token may reclaim its 30-day high of $0.00002488. SHIB Rally Is Imminent Beyond the push to reclaim its 30-day high, SHIB price is billed for an imminent rally. With memecoins like Dogecoin, BONK, and TRUMP Leverage ETF applications now filed by asset managers, Shiba Inu may also join the list. Should this happen, it might set off SHIB as a mature token for institutional investors to gain more exposure. Ultimately, Shiba Inu has crucial dormant triggers that might set it apart in the coming weeks when activated.

The reserve will support major digital assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum while also helping the platform manage market risks. World Liberty Financial Launches Macro Strategic Reserve The Macro Strategy reserve is designed to provide financial stability for WLFI by diversifying its holdings across multiple digital assets. The initiative aims to mitigate market volatility and enhance the platform’s long-term sustainability. According to a statement posted on X , WLFI described the reserve as a way to create a “robust financial backbone” for the platform. The company believes this move will not only secure its ecosystem but also enable future investments in innovative blockchain projects. WLFI has been actively expanding its cryptocurrency portfolio since its launch in October 2024, with recent investments in Ethereum (ETH), Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), Ondo (ONDO), Chainlink (LINK), and USD Coin (USDC). The Macro Strategy reserve will be used to strengthen these holdings while also exploring new opportunities in the market. Collaboration with Financial Institutions The company is engaging with financial institutions to contribute tokenized assets to the reserve. According to WLFI, the contributed assets will be stored in publicly accessible wallets, allowing institutions to gain transparent exposure to the crypto market. A blog post released on Tuesday stated that WLFI is in discussions with several firms about integrating Ondo Finance’s tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) into its treasury reserves sparking a ONDO price surge . These include Short-Term U.S. Government Treasuries (OUSG) and U.S. Dollar Yield (USDY) tokens. This collaboration is part of WLFI’s broader goal to connect traditional finance with decentralized finance (DeFi). The company believes that by working with financial institutions, it can help bring traditional assets on-chain and increase the adoption of tokenized investments. Market Activity and Recent Developments WLFI has been on a crypto buying spree in recent months. However, the company’s token holdings recently dropped from over $360 million to approximately $38 million, following a series of transactions that sent assets to exchanges. The reason behind these transfers has not been publicly disclosed. Despite this, WLFI continues to position itself as a major player in the DeFi sector. The company’s ties to former U.S. President Donald Trump have sparked discussions about potential conflicts of interest, but WLFI has not directly addressed these concerns. Concurrently, the World Liberty Financial has purchased 1,917 ETH ($5 million) and 830,469 MOVE tokens ($470,000), according to blockchain data tracker. This follows a pattern of frequent acquisitions as WLFI expands its investment strategy. Amid this announcement, the WLFI has invited its community to participate in discussions about the Macro Strategy reserve through its governance forum with a promise of a detailed proposal outlining the reserve’s structure and objectives hence allowing stakeholders to provide feedback.

A major crypto analyst, Arthur Hayes has warned traders to be aware of an incoming loss. While Bitcoin price is having a hard time growing, a new altcoin called RCOF is gaining a lot of attention. Experts believe its value has the potential to soar by over 50,000%. Smart investors are changing their focus to the next big opportunity. Let’s explore what’s driving this trend to the new altcoin and why traders are after the coin. Bitcoin Experiences Negative Price Predictions As Negative Market Sentiments Prevail Arthur Hayes, co-founder and former CEO of BitMEX believes that Bitcoin (BTC) could test prices between $70,000 and $75,000 in the next few months. In a blog post called “The Genie” on February 6, he mentioned that the ongoing political situation in America, even after Donald Trump was elected, might lead to a price drop similar to what was seen in late 2024. In October, Bitcoin was priced between $60,000 and $72,000. After Trump won the election in early November, excitement grew about a Bitcoin reserve, pushing the price above $100,000 in just 40 days. Currently, Bitcoin price is at around $95,960, but Arthur Hayes’ cautious view has surprised some people, especially since the market is currently stable. Bitcoin price is currently at about $95,960 , which is a drop of about 0.38%, but generally, Bitcoin price has been bullish over the past month. In response to the warning given by Arthur Hayes, some BTC investors have joined the RCO Finance presale in search of better pastures. RCO Finance (RCOF): The New Altcoin That is Always Green on The Market RCO Finance is a major game changer for decentralized finance in the crypto market. This new AI Altcoin is quickly taking attention from Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency in the market, as it maintains its price surge in the midst of market volatility. At the center of this AI Altcoin’s transformation is its main feature, an AI-powered Robo Advisor that eliminates the risk of investing. It includes machine learning capabilities, real-time market analysis, and automated trade executions, offering customers a significant advantage in the volatile cryptocurrency market. Imagine seeing the next big altcoin before it skyrockets. That’s exactly what the Robo Advisor does. It monitors top financial sources, including Bloomberg, Reuters, and on-chain analytics for early signs of breakout coins. For example, if you had this technology, it would have predicted the TRUMP token before it surged 100 times, putting you ahead of the competition. You should also be informed that the RCOF team is constantly working to provide upgrades to the Robo Advisor so as to ensure optimal performance. RCOF also allows you to rebalance your portfolio as needed, ensuring diversity across over 120,000 investment possibilities, including equities, ETFs, bonds, and tokenized assets, all on the same platform and without KYC verification. Additionally, RCOF’s debit cards allow investors to easily spend crypto assets in the real world. The ecosystem also facilitates fractional ownership through tokenization, allowing access to high-value investments such as real estate, equities, and commodities. The RCO Finance project has already deployed its new Beta Platform before the presale period closes, demonstrating its dedication to genuine utility. With over 10,000 people now on board, the Beta is continually gathering feedback to improve the AI’s performance. Join The RCOF Public Presale To Boost Your Portfolio The RCOF public presale is now in its 5th stage, with tokens priced at $0.100000. When it moves on to the next presale stage, the price will increase to $0.13000, meaning early investors would make a quick 30% profit automatically. Over $13.2 million has been raised, obviously pointing out that there’s trader excitement about it. In a bid to build investors’ trust, RCOF token’s smart contracts have passed a thorough audit by SolidProof , a well-known blockchain security company. This validation shows that RCOF is committed to offering a safe and trustworthy trading tool in the DeFi space. Joining the RCOF public presale is a wise decision that will speak in a short while from now. With BTC investors seeking shelter due to Arthur Hayes prediction of Bitcoin price, RCOF has appeared as a knight in shiny armor to save the day. Buy the RCOF token and increase your chances of being the next crypto billionaire!

Bill Barhydt says that economic policies under US President Donald Trump may inject a huge amount of liquidity into the markets causing crypto assets to soar to astronomical prices. Among his issued “base case” price targets for digital assets in the current cycle is that Bitcoin may increase by more than 259% from its current value. He also says that Ethereum ( ETH ) may increase by more than 200% from its current value. Meanwhile, he says Solana ( SOL ) may increase by at least 350% from its current value and Sui ( SUI ) may increase by more than 676% from its current value. “My base case for for current crypto cycle: Bitcoin: $350,000. Ethereum: $8,000. Solana: $900. Sui: $25. The high end of range is ~2x these values. My model is simple. This administration wants interest rates much lower and they’ll do whatever they have to to achieve that. They also need to refinance over $7 trillion in debt. Tax cuts are coming. All of this equates to a massive liquidity injection whether via QE (quantitative easing) or some other means.” He believes that market liquidity will start increasing within the first quarter of this year. Bitcoin is trading for $97,449 at time of writing, up 1.7% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, Ethereum is trading for $2,662 at time of writing, up 1.5% on the day. ETH competitor Solana is trading for $200 at time of writing, up 1.3% in the last 24 hours, while SOL rival Sui is trading for $3.22 at time of writing, up 8.8% on the day. In April of 2024, Barhydt issued another big crypto outlook when he said the digital asset market capitalization has the potential to increase to $50 trillion within a decade due to the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs).

OFFICIALMAGACOIN is that opportunity today, with predictions that it could become the next $2.5 million crypto sensation. >>> PRESALE LIVE NOW – LIMITED SPOTS! Why OFFICIALMAGACOIN Stands Out Having raised over $1.5 million during its presale, OFFICIALMAGACOIN is quickly building momentum. With a price under $0.20, the potential for massive returns has both retail and institutional investors flocking to secure their share. Let’s explore what makes OFFICIALMAGACOIN unique and how it stacks up against established players like Ethereum (ETH), Chainlink (LINK), Sei (SEI), and Bitcoin (BTC). 1. Rapid Investor ConfidenceOFFICIALMAGACOIN’s presale raised $1.5 million in record time, signaling strong confidence from early adopters. The combination of retail enthusiasm and growing institutional interest makes this coin a standout in the crowded crypto market. 2. Potential for Massive GrowthCrypto experts believe OFFICIALMAGACOIN could follow the trajectory of Bitcoin and Ethereum, offering exponential returns. With its low entry price and the scarcity created by exclusive distribution, the coin is primed for a rapid rise in value. >>>>>> PRESALE SELLING OUT – CLICK HERE TO SECURE YOUR SPOT! Comparing OFFICIALMAGACOIN to ETH, LINK, SEI, and BTC Ethereum (ETH): While ETH has revolutionized the crypto space, its maturity limits further exponential growth. Chainlink (LINK): A critical infrastructure coin, but focused more on utility than explosive price movement. Sei (SEI): A promising newcomer, but it lacks the excitement and exclusivity that OFFICIALMAGACOIN delivers. Bitcoin (BTC): The gold standard of crypto, but its early-stage growth potential is long gone. The Future Is OFFICIALMAGACOIN With its strong market momentum, low price, and massive growth potential, OFFICIALMAGACOIN is shaping up to be the investment of the year.

XRP’s price hit $3.03, showing increased interest from big investors, with ongoing ETF applications and a positive turn in the SEC’s attitude toward its new leaders. Despite facing international regulatory pressures, Binance Coin (BNB) continues to perform well, trading at $673.09. While the Web3 ecosystem keeps growing, most projects are still centrally managed—except for one. Web3Bay offers more than just a presale; it’s a marketplace owned by its users, where 3BAY holders make key decisions. Unlike Binance and XRP, which have closed-door governance, Web3Bay empowers its participants. Early joiners don’t just purchase tokens; they gain influence in shaping the future of decentralized online commerce. Web3Bay: Transforming Purchasers into Powerholders Traditional online marketplaces charge fees, impose rules, and make decisions in secrecy. Web3Bay changes this dynamic. Here, 3BAY token holders shape the platform’s growth, from policy settings to feature updates. Unlike Ripple XRP, which is controlled by a select few, Web3Bay places authority in the users’ hands. Owning tokens here means more than trading—they signify ownership and influence in the marketplace. The Web3Bay presale is heating up, with over $1.1 million raised and more than 295 million 3BAY tokens sold. Prices start at just $0.004562625 and are set to climb with each sale phase. Early investors secure tokens at far below the expected launch price of $0.1959. Holding 3BAY is not only about potential financial gains—it also includes governance rights, special discounts, and a say in platform decisions. The clock is ticking. Web3Bay is not just another presale; it’s a unique chance to shape a decentralized marketplace from the ground up. With each stage, prices increase, and those hesitating might end up paying much more. As the Web3 ecosystem moves toward decentralization, Web3Bay is at the forefront, offering its early supporters a role in governance. Join now to become a key player. Ripple XRP’s Major Advances: ETF Aspirations and Shifting Regulations Ripple XRP is advancing with fresh vigor, currently priced at $3.03 amid increasing institutional interest. The significant development? Organizations like Grayscale are striving to convert their XRP Trust into a spot XRP ETF, which could heighten mainstream acceptance. At the same time, Canada’s Purpose Investments is preparing to launch its own XRP ETF, aiming to be first on the market before the U.S. sanctions similar ventures. The future of XRP heavily depends on the swift approval of these ETFs by regulators. Simultaneously, Ripple XRP’s ongoing legal issues might be seeing a positive turn. With Paul Atkins at the helm of the SEC, a more crypto-friendly regulatory stance could emerge. If policies shift in Ripple’s favor, it might dismantle the primary obstacle hindering XRP’s progress. The focus now rests on regulatory decisions that could reshape the landscape. Binance Coin Endures Regulatory Focus but Keeps Market Lead Binance Coin (BNB) remains robust at $673.09, despite increased regulatory scrutiny. French authorities have initiated an investigation into Binance for alleged money laundering and tax evasion from 2019 to 2024. Despite these challenges, Binance upholds its position as the leading crypto exchange, boasting 245 million users and a daily trading volume of $14 billion. Its substantial liquidity and competitive fees continue to make it a preferred choice among traders. Contrary to Ripple XRP, whose regulatory uncertainties have impeded its progress, Binance is broadening its services. The exchange recently introduced the VVVUSDT Perpetual Contract, which allows up to 25x leverage on the Venice Token (VVV). Although legal concerns persist, Binance’s market influence remains unshaken. The ongoing question is how regulatory pressures might affect its long-term expansion. The Bottom Line Both Binance Coin (BNB) and Ripple XRP are navigating significant changes. Ripple XRP is building momentum with ETF applications and favorable regulatory shifts, potentially opening new doors. Meanwhile, Binance Coin continues to rule the exchange scene, even amidst legal scrutiny in France. These entities play crucial roles, yet their decisions are made away from public scrutiny, leaving users with limited control. This is where Web3Bay steps in, revolutionizing control by empowering its users. Web3Bay allows 3BAY holders to mold the platform’s future, vote on policies, and directly reap the benefits of its growth. As the presale price increases with each phase, early investors do more than buy tokens—they gain a stake in directing the Web3 ecosystem . This isn’t just another investment; it’s an opportunity to lead.

By 2028, FLOW could reach a maximum price of $2.37. In 2031, FLOW will range between $6 to $7.62. Flow coin, the native token of the Flow blockchain created by Dapper Labs, is essential for powering decentralized applications (dApps) and digital assets. Flow aims to provide a high-performance, user-friendly platform that tackles scalability without sacrificing decentralization. Its unique architecture allows developers to build secure and efficient smart contracts. FLOW, its native token, has several key uses within the ecosystem, including paying transaction fees, staking, and participating in network governance. The growing number of dApps and users on the platform drives demand for Flow coin, influencing FLOW’s price movements. Given Flow coin’s strong fundamentals and growing support levels in the ecosystem, the question arises: how high can FLOW go? What will FLOW price be in 2025? Overview Cryptocurrency Flow Token FLOW Price $0.504 Market Cap $800,213,892.21 Trading Volume $32,273,979.66 Circulating Supply 1,562,246,493.58 FLOW All-time High $46.16 Apr 05, 2021 All-time Low $0.3921 Sep 12, 2023 24-hour High $0.5345 24-hour Low $0.503 Flow coin technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 17.88% 50-Day SMA $0.705 14-Day RSI 28.34 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 44 (Fear) Green Days 15/30 (50%) 200-Day SMA $0.661 Flow price analysis: FLOW makes a slight recovery, but resistance lies at $0.515 TL;DR Breakdown The broader market outlook for FLOW is bearish. However, the coin has seen some recovery, making attempts to break past $0.515. Flow is below the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level. Flow coin 1-day price analysis: FLOW sees slight buying pressure amid broader bearish trend FLOW’s price analysis for February 12 shows that the coin is in a downtrend and below the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level. Resistance levels stand at $0.579 and $0.727. Flow coin remains under the middle Bollinger Bands, suggesting weak momentum. FLOW sees slight buying pressure amid broader bearish trend On the other hand, the MACD indicator shows slight buying pressure, with the MACD line trading above the signal line. A break above $0.579 could push FLOW towards $0.727 or higher. In the bearish case, FLOW might retest support at $0.416. Flow coin 4-hour price analysis: FLOW faces resistance at $0.515 Flow coin shows some recovery on the 4-hour chart but is struggling to break above resistance at $0.515. The coin’s immediate support is present at $0.500. FLOW faces resistance at $0.515 The Community Channel Index’s value (78.79) indicates that FLOW is slightly overbought, and a short-term pullback could ensue. The Chaikin Money Flow’s value, at 0, indicates relative buying and selling pressure with no clear direction. FLOW needs to break past immediate resistance to confirm an uptrend. FLOW technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.5782 SELL SMA 5 $0.5464 SELL SMA 10 $0.5841 SELL SMA 21 $0.6352 SELL SMA 50 $0.7058 SELL SMA 100 $0.7476 SELL SMA 200 $0.6610 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 0.6304 SELL EMA 5 $ 0.6644 SELL EMA 10 $ 0.7021 SELL EMA 21 $ 0.7385 SELL EMA 50 $ 0.7692 SELL EMA 100 $ 0.7448 SELL EMA 200 $ 0.7263 SELL What to expect from Flow? While the broader sentiment for FLOW is negative, the short-term momentum indicates a recovery, although weak. The coin must clear resistance at $0.564 to confirm a sustained recovery. If this does not happen, traders should look out for a price consolidation or further downside below $0.491. Is FLOW a good investment? Flow coin has potential as an investment due to its strong partnerships with major brands and its focus on powering decentralized applications, especially in the NFT and gaming spaces. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it carries significant volatility and risks, so investors should carefully consider market conditions and risk tolerance before investing. Why is Flow price dropping? Flow price history Flow is range-bound, attributable to an equilibrium between buyers’ and sellers’ pressure. At the moment, there are no clear directions. Will FLOW recover? FLOW can potentially recover if it can break through resistance levels and maintain momentum. The market’s current consolidation phase suggests a possible breakout, which could either see selling pressure and drive prices higher or lead to further declines. Close monitoring is crucial as market dynamics remain volatile. Will FLOW reach $1? The $1 price mark is within range, having reached that level in early December 2024. Renewed buyer interest in the coming weeks will surely push FLOW to $1 and above. Will FLOW reach $5? This level has not been achieved since February 2022. For FLOW to recapture the $5 levels, significant cash inflows will be required. Can FLOW reach $50? FLOW has previously reached an all-time high (ATH) of $46.16, so reaching $50 is definitely achievable. However, a significant bull run and tangible ecosystem updates are required to achieve this feat, as the coin is currently 98% below its ATH. Is Flow a good blockchain? Flow is a solid blockchain, especially for gaming and NFTs. It is designed for scalability, fast transactions, and low fees. The network’s unique multi-role architecture improves efficiency without compromising decentralization. However, it faces fierce competition, and adoption levels are not as high as those of Ethereum and Solana. Does FLOW have a good long-term future?

Hester Peirce (also known as ‘Crypto Mom’), one of the agency’s longest-serving commissioners and its most outspoken crypto advocate, confirmed on Tuesday that the SEC will no longer use enforcement actions as a substitute for regulatory policy. “During the past several years, enforcement cases have been used as a way to make regulatory policy; that is very atypical,” Peirce said in a live interview on Bloomberg’s Crypto TV segment on Tuesday. “We’re trying to get back to a path where we’re really using our other tools to make policy.” This comes less than a day after the SEC asked a federal court to pause its lawsuit against Binance for 60 days. The regulator sued Binance and its co-founder, Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao, in 2023, accusing them of mishandling customer funds, misleading investors, and violating US securities laws. The SEC’s legal team told the court on Monday that a new regulatory framework is being developed and that ongoing cases may need to be reconsidered. Notably, Peirce refused to say whether the SEC would drop the Binance lawsuit entirely, and also declined to comment on whether other lawsuits, including the one against Coinbase Global, could be dismissed. “It’s facts and circumstances,” she said . “We’ll have to look at each case on its merits as we go forward.” Two days after his inauguration, president Trump signed an executive order creating a special advisory group on crypto policy and a national digital asset stockpile. His administration is also considering a national bitcoin strategic reserve. SEC ends its war on crypto “We have been using enforcement cases to set regulatory policy,” Peirce said in her interview. “We’re trying to shift that so we actually set policy and then we bring enforcement cases as needed.” The question of who should regulate crypto—the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)—has been debated for years. Peirce says the SEC is currently reviewing its jurisdiction and will flag regulatory gaps for Congress to address. In her words: “We’re working on looking at our jurisdiction that we currently have and saying what falls inside that jurisdiction and what falls outside that jurisdiction, then we can point out to Congress where we think there are gaps where maybe something is not covered by our jurisdiction.” Crypto registration, Bitcoin ETFs, meme coins, and the future of the SEC For so long, crypto companies struggled to register with the SEC as the agency, along with the Federal Reserve, made it impossible for banks to even dabble with the industry. Peirce says the agency is now actively fixing that problem. “We’ve just put roadblock after roadblock up against people who are trying to come in and talk to us as we’ve asked them to do or come in and register as we’ve asked them to do and so all I’m asking is that we have an innovation policy that allows people to innovate and that allows people to try new things,” says Perice. Right now, the SEC is processing applications for exemptive relief, which would allow crypto companies to bypass outdated financial rules that were written long before digital assets existed. “We’re looking at all kinds of different adjustments that need to be made,” Peirce said. Also, as Cryptopolitan reported just yesterday, Fed chair Jerome Powell has also said that he would be looking into crypto debanking and hopefully fix the whole situation. Meanwhile, the SEC is also reviewing the classification of crypto trading platforms. Peirce says the SEC’s first step is to determine whether a trading platform deals in securities. If it does, it will be required to register. If it doesn’t, the SEC will back off. Peirce, who has been a longtime supporter of Bitcoin ETFs, also confirmed that the agency is actively reviewing all new ETF applications, particularly those of XRP, Solana, Litecoin, and Dogecoin. Trump’s personal involvement in crypto has of course raised new regulatory questions. Peirce was asked whether the President and First Lady launching their own meme coins makes the SEC’s job more complicated. She refused to comment directly on the matter but did acknowledge that many meme coins may not fall under the SEC’s jurisdiction. “Many of these meme coins probably do not have a home under the SEC’s current regulations.” If Congress or the CFTC wants to regulate them instead, Peirce says, “that’s their call.” Meanwhile, the SEC itself is shrinking. The agency recently extended a deferred resignation program allowing staff to leave voluntarily. Peirce wouldn’t say how many employees had accepted the offer but confirmed that the agency is downsizing and restructuring. “We’re always thinking about how we can do our jobs more efficiently and effectively,” was all she said. Peirce was also asked whether the SEC is overstaffed as Elon Musk’s D.O.G.E department goes on a spending cut rampage. Peirce explained subtly that the SEC will always need enforcement teams, but now those teams will be focused on legitimate violations instead of trying to regulate crypto through lawsuits, so Elon doesn’t have to worry about them.

Major crypto centralized exchanges witnessed a 25% drop in spot trading volume in January 2025 compared to the figures recorded in December 2024. Data collected and compiled by a WuBlockchain team shows that the top three exchanges in terms of change rate were HTX with a negative 8%, Kraken with a negative 10%, and Bybit with a negative 11%. The exchanges that trailed behind claimed the bottom three spots: Bitget, with negative 46%; Kucoin, with negative 41%; and Mexc, with negative 36%. Binance leads CEXs with the highest spot trading volume A chart shared in the report shows that Binance recorded the largest volume in both December last year and January 2025.

The office, which was created by president Donald Trump, is tracking government workers making a few hundred thousand dollars but somehow sitting on tens of millions. “We find it sort of rather odd that there are quite a few people in the bureaucracy who have a salary of a few hundred thousand dollars but somehow manage to accrue tens of millions of dollars in net worth,” Elon said from the Oval today. “We’re just curious as to where it came from.” Federal agencies forced to cooperate with Elon Trump has ordered federal agencies to cooperate with D.O.G.E to drastically reduce the size of the federal workforce, according to a White House fact sheet released today. The plan limits agencies to hiring one new employee for every four that leave, except in law enforcement, national security, immigration, and public safety. document.createElement('video'); https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/qSVcrbIcVyRsrmff.mp4 As you can see in the video above, Elon made a rare appearance in the Oval alongside self-proclaimed best buddy Trump to defend D.O.G.E’s strategy. His approach has of course been to deploy young investigators across federal agencies, comb through payroll systems, track employee assets, and—when necessary—shut down entire offices. Trump said D.O.G.E had already uncovered “billions and billions of dollars in waste, fraud, and abuse.” No direct evidence was provided, but Elon claimed that Treasury Department systems lacked basic safeguards to stop payments to banned entities. “It’s like just a massive number of blank checks just flying out of the building,” Elon told reporters. The eccentric billionaire has also been posting cases of fraud on X, exposing major inefficiencies in federal spending. He admitted that some of his claims could be incorrect but said they should just be fact-checked and corrected if that’s the case then. “Trust me, I want to be wrong. I want it proven to me that the scale of corruption I have discovered is, you know, inaccurate,” said Elon. Federal workers face uncertain future Trump has vowed to push D.O.G.E’s findings through Congress if necessary. He also blasted federal judges for blocking some of his government overhaul efforts but said he would “abide by the courts.” Elon Musk with his kid, X, at the Oval with president Trump Meanwhile, a federal judge in Rhode Island ruled that the White House had not fully complied with an order to release billions in federal grant money. For employees resisting the buyout plan, the situation is uncertain. Government reduction-in-force regulations allow laid-off federal workers to receive up to one year’s salary in severance, depending on age and years of service. Some workers may be reassigned, while others could face immediate dismissal, Elon told the reporters. Newly-appointed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has stuck by Elon’s side, saying he agrees completely with everything he’s doing and is aligning all his missions at the Treasury with those of D.O.G.E. Ken Griffin, founder of Citadel, also praised Elon’s efforts to curb government waste but took a swipe at Trump’s trade policies. “He will do what it takes to win,” Griffin said about Elon at the UBS Financial Services Conference in Miami today. “Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for making sure my tax dollars are spent effectively.” Elon’s aggressive tactics aren’t surprising. He has a long history of cutting jobs fast without warning, and this guy calls himself an “efficiency freak.” At Tesla, Elon laid off 9% of the workforce in 2018, and in 2023, it was around 22%, with termination emails sent out at 2 in the morning. When he took over Twitter (now X) in 2022, Elon fired 80% of the staff—about 6,000 employees.

Though the cryptosphere at large has been inundated with politics as of late (with resultant meager coverage of tech), several important smart contract upgrades to the Bitcoin Cash network are set to go live in May. Bitcoin Cash supporters have been busy buying up so-called “Velma” non-fungible tokens (NFTs) this year, in order to attend the the BCH Bliss 2025 conference, in Ljubljana, Slovenia. The name “Velma” is a phonetic nod to the features of the coming May 2025 upgrade, which deals with Virtual Machine Limits (VML). 2024’s upgrade, which implemented an “Adaptive Blocksize Limit Algorithm,” was playfully meme’d into the attractive, yet non-existent celeb called “Jessica ABLA.” Velma NFTs on Tapswap.cash. BCH Bliss 2025 to focus on Velma upgrade, adoption As reported previously, the Velma upgrade use cases, according to Bitcoin Cash devs, include: “…more advanced automated market making and exchange protocols, decentralized stablecoins, collateralized loan protocols, cross-chain and sidechain bridges” and “zero-knowledge proofs” among other features. Essentially, this year’s upgrade seeks to continue streamlining and building out capabilities that were added with the Cashtokens upgrade in 2023, which enabled UTXO (unspent transaction output)-based smart contracts and token creation on the Bitcoin Cash network for negligible fees. The BCH Bliss 2025 conference will be held from May 13-15 in Ljubljana, Slovenia. Source: Bliss.cash. Tickets for the conference this year take the form of non-fungible “Velma” tokens sold largely on the BCH tokens marketplace Tapswap . A tentative list of speakers has been announced already, featuring miners, app developers, and other prominent figures in the BCH ecosystem focusing on increasing global adoption of the peer-to-peer cash. Political sensationalism not deterring development, privacy While it’s near impossible to read the news these days and not be flooded with partisan politics and polemics, important wallet integrations, stablecoin protocols, and smart contract features continue to develop under the mass media radar on many crypto networks, including Bitcoin Cash. For example, the popular, Philippines-based Paytaca Wallet has just announced a feature (still in early alpha mode) which allows users to stabilize their BCH in dollar value at anytime, in-app, via an integration with BCHBull, a smart-contract based hedging and speculation platform created by Bitcoin Cash developer group General Protocols. This addition complements recent updates to BCHBull itself, and a BCH-based stablecoin experiment called Moria Money . When asked by Cryptopolitan for their thoughts on the upgrade and Bliss conference, Bitcoin Cash Tokyo Meetup organizer and Bliss 2024 attendee BigV noted: “Bliss 2024 had an impressive global reach with attendees flying into Slovenia from all over the world, with a significant number of BCH community activists, developers, enthusiasts and business owners from Japan, which has always been a hot spot for Bitcoin Cash … Bliss 2025 and the May upgrade removes several ‘blockers’ that have to date prevented many of Satoshi’s [bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto’s] unfinished Bitcoin Script ideas, delivering a highly efficient, elegant and practical platform upon which to develop the next generation of decentralised finance applications.” The Tokyo meetup organizer also mentioned “significant efficiency and deployment advantages” over competing EVM (electronic virtual machine)-based chains “which do not scale effectively and existing privacy coins which are less attractive due to the existence of pre-mined tokens hoarded by the ‘foundation,’ tail-emmission inflation and privacy algorithms that are entrenched at the base layer.” Further, with the CashFusion privacy protocol, BigV notes BCH “is thus uniquely positioned to not just be money for the world, but to enable access to powerful permissionless decentralised financial tools to every human on earth.” Cryptopolitan Academy: How to Write a Web3 Resume That Lands Interviews - FREE Cheat Sheet",Bitcoin Cash News & Market Updates|News|BCH|General Protocols|Paytaca|Philippines|Slovenia,EN,0,0,BCH|ASIA|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-12 01:48:58

Unlike typical blockchain projects that focus on finance, gaming, or memes, Web3Bay disrupts the multi-trillion-dollar online retail sector by ensuring transparency, and security, and eliminating fees. It offers staking rewards, community-driven governance, and an appealing high-growth presale, quickly establishing itself as a prominent project priced under $1. Web3Bay (3BAY): Leading Decentralized E-Commerce Domain In today’s market dominated by giants like Amazon, eBay, and Shopify, traditional e-commerce platforms set prices, charge fees, and collect user data. Web3Bay is revolutionizing this landscape by introducing full transparency, reduced costs, and user ownership through blockchain technology. What makes Web3Bay the best crypto to buy today in 2025? 1. Full Decentralization & Smart Contract Renouncement Web3Bay fully decentralizes its operations unlike typical platforms. Following its presale, the development team will relinquish control of its smart contract, preventing any central authority from influencing the platform. Governance shifts to 3BAY token holders who will make crucial decisions regarding transaction fees, feature additions, and partnership strategies. 2. Passive Income with Staking Rewards Web3Bay extends beyond shopping; it also serves as a passive income source. By staking 3BAY tokens, holders can earn rewards, appealing to long-term investors. This staking model allows participants to increase their holdings through price growth and staking returns. 3. 5% Discount for Payments in 3BAY Crypto struggles to gain traction without practical utility. Web3Bay addresses this by offering a 5% discount on transactions using 3BAY tokens, promoting adoption and ensuring the token’s practical value from the outset. 4. Rapid Presale Growth & Huge ROI Potential Web3Bay’s presale is advancing rapidly, already generating over $1 million and distributing more than 285 million tokens. With a current presale price of $0.00456 at Stage 4 and an expected launch price of $0.1959, early investors might see a return on investment up to 4,200%. Analysts anticipate even higher gains following the launch as adoption expands. Web3Bay’s decentralized structure, robust tokenomics, and real-world utility position it as one of the most promising crypto projects for 2025. Bitcoin (BTC): Staying Strong as Crypto’s Cornerstone Bitcoin remains the foundational asset of the cryptocurrency market. The halving event in April 2024 reduced block rewards, enhancing BTC’s scarcity and pushing its price higher. Additionally, institutional adoption has soared with the approval of spot ETFs and broader governmental recognition of Bitcoin as a valuable store of assets. As Bitcoin moves towards wider acceptance and copes with a finite supply, it continues to be one of the best cryptos to buy today. Solana (SOL): Pioneering Speed in Blockchain Technology Solana stands out in the DeFi, NFT, and Web3 gaming landscapes due to its exceptional transaction speed and efficiency, handling over 2,400 transactions per second at minimal costs. It’s one of the top scalable Layer 1 blockchain available. Recent enhancements have resolved earlier network issues, boosting reliability and attracting a larger developer base and institutional interest. With ongoing ETF applications and AI enhancements, Solana is well-positioned as a leading investment for 2025. Cardano (ADA): Most Secure & Decentralization Blockchain Cardano distinguishes itself as one of the most secure and decentralized blockchains, furthered by its Plomin Hard Fork that has integrated on-chain governance, empowering ADA holders with decision-making authority. The platform is broadening its scope in DeFi, corporate partnerships, and staking solutions, with an increasing number of projects building on its network. Cardano’s research-driven methodology underpins its robust security and operational efficiency. With its expanding institutional relationships and upcoming innovations like the Hydra Layer 2 solution, Cardano is set for wider adoption and potential price growth, marking it as a wise choice for 2025. XRP (XRP): Transforming International Payments XRP remains at the forefront of global payment solutions, bolstered by recent regulatory approvals for its RLUSD stablecoin. It continues to facilitate quick, cost-effective international transactions, reinforcing its role in blending crypto with conventional finance. Despite previous legal challenges, Ripple’s advancements in regulatory clarity have solidified its standing in the financial community. Ongoing partnerships with banks underscore a growing trust in XRP’s utility. With its capabilities for instant settlements and low transaction costs, XRP is crucial for modern financial systems. Overview: Best Cryptos to Buy in 2025 The dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market ensures that 2025 will be a pivotal year. Established players like Bitcoin, Solana, Cardano, and XRP are poised to remain influential, while newcomers like Web3Bay demonstrate that innovative projects with practical applications can make significant inroads. With its successful presale, solid use cases, and potential for substantial returns, Web3Bay may emerge as an unexpected leader in the 2025 crypto landscape. For investors seeking stability or growth, these cryptocurrencies are essential considerations for your portfolio.

The blockchain will host the Legacy Mesh solution to connect USDT deployments on Arbitrum, Ethereum, Tron and Ton to a unified USDT0 network. Thanks to Legacy Mesh, users will be able to move USDT between chains for lower costs and with greater access to liquidity pools. USDT0 is intended to free up siloed liquidity by eliminating the burdensome process of bridging. USDT0 is backed 1:1 with USDT. Legacy Mesh will leverage LayerZero’s interoperability protocol. USDT0 will increase access to liquidity pools Steven Goldfeder, co-founder and CEO of Arbitrum developer Offchain Labs, said, “The Legacy Mesh is an important milestone for Arbitrum, ensuring that users and developers have access to deep, liquid markets regardless of the blockchain they are on.” Users will be able to interact with USDT- and USDT0-supported chains. Many emerging blockchain ecosystems, such as Ink, Berachain and MegaETH, support USDT0, according to an Arbitrum press release . The new solution will also permit frictionless transfers of USDT to Telegram wallets, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said on X. By linking the four major blockchains, the introduction of USDT0 connects $138 billion of Tether into a single system. According to the USDT0 blog on Mirror, that represents 98% of all Tether. Tether is thriving despite MiCA Tether began its transition from bridged USDT to USDT0 in January with an automatic swap on the Arbitrum chain, which is a layer-2 Ethereum scaling solution that uses optimistic rollups for consensus. Tether recorded a profit of $13 billion in 2024, despite the boost its competitors received when USDT was excluded from the European Union in July by Markets in Crypto-Assets regulations. It remains by far the largest stablecoin by market cap. Tether’s fortunes look bright in the United States, where newly reelected President Donald Trump is seen as a supporter of dollar-pegged stablecoin in general and Howard Lutnick, CEO of investment firm Cantor Fitzgerald has been nominated to be the next secretary of commerce. Cantor Fitzgerald is the portfolio manager of Tether’s U.S. Treasury securities.

When it launched in August 2020, its price was barely a fraction of a cent, allowing those who believed in its potential to turn small investments into life-changing fortunes. Today, many regret missing out on SHIB’s rise, but a new opportunity is making waves—Arctic Pablo Coin (APC). With an adventurous narrative and a skyrocketing presale, it’s being hailed as one of the best crypto presales to buy right now. This article will explore Shiba Inu’s incredible early success and why Arctic Pablo Coin could be the next big thing for those looking for a high-potential meme coin presale. Shiba Inu’s Early Investors Struck Gold Shiba Inu started as a joke but quickly became a serious player in the crypto world. When SHIB first began trading, its price was so low that a few dollars could buy millions of tokens. By October 2021, SHIB’s value had soared, reaching an all-time high of $0.00008845. Investors who held their tokens from the beginning saw returns of over 1,000,000%, turning small stakes into fortunes. But not everyone was lucky enough to get in early. Many investors watched from the sidelines, unsure whether to take the risk. By the time they realized SHIB’s potential, the price had already skyrocketed, leaving them wishing they had acted sooner. Now, Arctic Pablo Coin is presenting a similar opportunity. Arctic Pablo Coin (APC): A New Era of Meme Coins Begins Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a storytelling-driven crypto project with a unique approach to presale structure. Inspired by an adventurous explorer, APC ties each phase of its presale to a different mythical or legendary location, adding excitement and exclusivity to every stage. Staking Rewards: Earn While You Hold Unlike early meme coins that lacked utility, Arctic Pablo Coin offers a staking mechanism with a 66% APY during its presale. This means investors can earn high rewards simply by holding APC tokens, making it one of the best crypto presales to buy for passive income seekers. Referral Bonuses: Turn Your Network into Earnings APC isn’t just about holding—it’s about growing. The project features an attractive referral incentive, allowing users to earn additional tokens by spreading the word. Those who take advantage of this feature can significantly boost their holdings, just like early SHIB investors who shared the opportunity. Community-Driven Competitions: More Than Just a Token Arctic Pablo Coin thrives on engagement. The team has introduced exciting community competitions where participants can win APC tokens or USD rewards. This approach strengthens its community while giving early investors more reasons to stay engaged. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Presale: A Once-in-a-Lifetime Opportunity? The presale is already in Stage 10, Aqua Frost, with a current price of $0.000059. With over $1.1 million raised, the momentum is building fast. If history teaches anything, it’s that early-stage meme coins with strong narratives can explode in value. Arctic Pablo Coin’s journey has already seen significant growth, and its projected ROI from Stage 10 to the listing price of $0.008 stands at 13,451.72%. For those who regret missing Shiba Inu’s launch, Arctic Pablo Coin is offering a second chance at a high-potential meme coin presale . Final Thoughts: Will You Watch or Act This Time? Shiba Inu created countless millionaires, but not everyone had the foresight to invest early. Now, Arctic Pablo Coin is emerging as a fresh opportunity with a unique narrative, staking rewards, and a rapidly advancing presale. With prices set to rise as it enters new locations, the window to buy at a low entry point is closing. Don’t let history repeat itself—secure your APC tokens before it’s too late! For More Information: Arctic Pablo Coin: https://www.arcticpablo.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/ArcticPabloOfficial Twitter: https://x.com/arcticpabloHQ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What was Shiba Inu’s price when it first launched? Shiba Inu started trading at a fraction of a cent, allowing early investors to accumulate large amounts for very little. What makes Arctic Pablo Coin different from other meme coins? Arctic Pablo Coin integrates an adventurous narrative, staking rewards, referral incentives, and community-driven competitions, setting it apart from traditional meme coins. What is the current stage and price of Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale? Arctic Pablo Coin is currently in Stage 10 (Aqua Frost), with a price of $0.000059 per token. How does Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale structure work? Unlike standard staged presales, APC’s phases are tied to unique locations, making each phase part of an unfolding adventure. Why is Arctic Pablo Coin considered one of the best crypto presales to buy? With a strong narrative, high staking APY, referral rewards, and a rapidly progressing presale, APC offers a rare opportunity to get in early on a high-potential meme coin.

BTC is struggling and might extend losses if it stays below the $100,000 level. Bitcoin started a fresh decline from the $98,500 resistance zone. The price is trading below $96,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $96,670 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears the $97,600 zone. Bitcoin Price Dips Again Bitcoin price failed to continue higher above the $100,000 zone. It started another decline below the $96,500 zone. BTC gained bearish momentum for a move below the $96,000 and $95,500 levels. There was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $96,670 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The price tested the $95,000 zone and recently recovered some losses. There was a move above the $95,750 level. The price surpassed the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $98,442 swing high to the $94,899 low. Bitcoin price is now trading below $96,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $96,650 level. The first key resistance is near the $97,000 level. The next key resistance could be $97,600 or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $98,442 swing high to the $94,899 low. A close above the $97,600 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $98,500 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $100,000 level. Another Decline In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $97,000 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $95,500 level. The first major support is near the $95,000 level. The next support is now near the $93,500 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $92,000 support in the near term. The main support sits at $91,000. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $95,500, followed by $95,000.

For those planning ahead, finding the best long-term cryptos could lead to huge returns. But with so many choices, how do you find real value instead of just hype? With 2025 expected to be a major year for crypto, we’ve picked three growing altcoins with strong foundations and big growth potential. One of them, Web3Bay (3BAY), is making waves in decentralized e-commerce. Most cryptos focus on DeFi, AI, or memes, but Web3Bay is addressing a trillion-dollar market—online shopping. By cutting out middlemen, removing hidden fees, and providing passive earnings, voting rights, and real-world use, Web3Bay is one of the best long-term cryptos under $1 today. Let’s look at three cryptos set for major growth in 2025 and why Web3Bay is leading the way. Web3Bay (3BAY): The Future of Online Shopping on Blockchain Big companies like Amazon, eBay, and Shopify dominate e-commerce, taking high fees, controlling user data, and limiting seller options. Web3Bay is changing this by bringing fairness, transparency, and full ownership to online shopping. 1. Full Decentralization & Smart Contract Lock Unlike many projects that claim decentralization but still hold control, Web3Bay is truly community-driven. After presale, the team will lock its smart contract, making sure no one—not even Web3Bay—can alter the platform. 2. Earn Passive Income Through Staking Web3Bay is not just for shopping; it’s also a way to grow assets. Those who hold 3BAY can stake their holdings and receive rewards, making it an ideal choice for those who prefer long-term earning. By staking 3BAY, users help keep the network stable while getting more coins in return—a win-win for both the system and its community. 3. 5% Discount on Purchases with 3BAY Unlike many cryptos that have no real-world use, Web3Bay allows buyers to get a 5% discount when using 3BAY for payments. This increases adoption while ensuring the coin has value from day one. 4. No Extra Charges, No Middlemen Traditional online stores take a big cut from sellers’ earnings. Web3Bay removes these unnecessary costs, offering a fee-free space where buyers and sellers connect directly. This setup makes Web3Bay a great option for businesses wanting higher profits and smoother transactions. 5. Growing Presale & High Return Potential Web3Bay’s presale is rapidly gaining attention, with over $1 million raised and 280 million coins sold. Currently valued at $0.00456 in Stage 4, its expected launch price of $0.1959 could bring a 4,200% return for early buyers. As crypto adoption continues, Web3Bay’s real-world utility and voting system makes it one of the best long-term cryptos, offering lasting benefits beyond short-term market trends. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU): From NFT Collection to Meme Coin Power Pudgy Penguins began as one of the top NFT collections in 2021 and has now entered the meme coin market. The PENGU coin allows access to exclusive content, NFT releases, and gaming experiences, combining meme culture with Web3. While meme coins often depend on social hype rather than solid use cases, Pudgy Penguins has a strong brand, an engaged community, and recognizable designs—factors that could push PENGU forward in 2025. However, meme coins tend to be unstable. Those interested in them should be aware of possible sudden price changes. Worldcoin (WLD): A Chance to Buy at a Low Price? Worldcoin gained attention in 2023 as an AI-based crypto linked to OpenAI. It seeks to verify digital identities through biometric scans, aiming to create a global financial network on blockchain. After an initial price spike, Worldcoin’s popularity dropped, and WLD is now 81.5% below its highest point. But with AI-driven cryptos becoming more common, some see WLD as a possible comeback pick—especially as AI and blockchain continue merging. That said, concerns about privacy and regulations remain major hurdles that could affect Worldcoin’s success over time. Best Long-Term Cryptos for 2025– Final Verdict! Each of these projects has strong potential, but Web3Bay stands out with its clear real-world purpose. While PENGU and Worldcoin rely on market trends, Web3Bay’s decentralized shopping system, passive earnings, and fee-free model offer long-term value. With a locked smart contract, staking rewards, voting rights, and a fair marketplace, Web3Bay is among the best long-term cryptos available today. Plus, its presale momentum and strong growth projections make it a solid choice for those looking beyond short-lived market hype. As e-commerce moves toward decentralization, Web3Bay is shaping the future of online shopping. Its approach ensures fair access for all, making it one of the best long-term cryptos to watch in 2025 and beyond.

SEC Crypto Task Force Head Hester Peirce Weighs In appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In a major development, cryptocurrency exchange Binance and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have filed a joint motion to pause their ongoing legal battle for 60 days. In the light of this news, Hester Peirce, SEC Commissioner and Head of the SEC Crypto Task Force, was asked “What other cases do you have to untangle?” Speaking to Bloomberg, Peirce said that people are aware the SEC has filed many cases in recent years against various individuals and entities in the crypto space. Each case needs to be considered individually, and there are many cases to handle. She added that this part of the work will take time and patience. Peirce was also questioned about her stance on crypto and whether she advocates for the industry. She clarified that she does not describe herself as a proponent of the industry, but as a “freedom maximalist.” She believes in the importance of using regulation to support innovation rather than stifle it. Peirce criticized the SEC’s approach, saying that it has put up roadblocks for people trying to engage with regulators or register as required.

She opened up about the ability of blockchain technology to enable people to collaborate globally and securely, opening new possibilities in both financial and non-financial sectors. Peirce expressed excitement about the future of crypto and its potential integration into traditional financial systems, while also exploring other uses outside of finance.

ETH might gain bullish momentum if it clears the $2,700 resistance zone. Ethereum started a fresh decline below the $2,650 level. The price is trading below $2,680 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,690 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a decent upward move if it settles above $2,700 and $2,735. Ethereum Price Eyes Upside Break Ethereum price started a fresh decline below the $2,800 support zone, like Bitcoin . ETH declined below the $2,750 and $2,700 support levels to move into a short-term bearish zone. The price dipped and tested the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $2,125 swing low to the $2,922 high. Finally, it found support near the $2,500 zone. The price is now consolidating and seems to be forming a base above the $2,500 level. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,680 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,690 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,680 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,735 level. The main resistance is now forming near $2,800 or $2,820. A clear move above the $2,820 resistance might send the price toward the $2,920 resistance. An upside break above the $2,920 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,000 resistance zone or even $3,050 in the near term. Another Drop In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,700 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,550 level. The first major support sits near the $2,520 zone. A clear move below the $2,520 support might push the price toward the $2,440 support or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $2,125 swing low to the $2,922 high. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,365 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,250.

It’s no secret that traders love volatility, and right now, Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) is seeing a trading volume surge of 15.44%, while Floki Inu’s market cap just shot up by 7.18%. But there’s an even bigger shake-up happening—BTFD Coin (BTFD) has entered Stage 14 of its presale, burning all unsold tokens from Stage 13 and launching an exclusive referral program that’s turning heads. Meme coins have evolved beyond their viral status. They’re now serious investment opportunities backed by powerful communities and innovative financial models. These best new meme coins for significant returns don’t just offer hype; they deliver results. BTFD Coin, Peanut the Squirrel, and Floki Inu are proving why meme coins remain some of the most exciting assets in crypto today. BTFD Coin’s Referral Program Ignites Massive Investor Interest Imagine earning rewards just for spreading the word about a booming meme coin. That’s exactly what’s happening with BTFD Coin’s Referral Program , an initiative designed to reward early supporters while increasing community participation. It’s a game-changer—traders can earn 10% of the amount their referrals invest in BTFD tokens if they make it into the top 20 referrers of the month. The BTFD Coin presale has already raised over $6 million, with 69 billion tokens sold and a growing holder count of over 10,500 Bulls. At $0.00016 per token, Stage 14 is offering investors a massive opportunity. When the token lists at $0.0006, investors who get in now could see serious returns. Analysts predict that if BTFD Coin reaches $0.006, the upside potential is staggering. A $4,000 investment at today’s price gets 25 million BTFD tokens, which would be worth $15,000 at listing and $150,000 at peak projection. BTFD Coin isn’t just about numbers; it’s a movement fueled by its Bulls Squad, a community that believes in holding strong. With its play-to-earn game already launched, a staking system offering 90% APY, and aggressive tokenomics, BTFD Coin is locking in investor confidence. Buying BTFD is straightforward. Investors connect their wallets on the BTFD buy page , load BNB or ETH, enter the LAUNCH100 bonus code, and purchase their tokens. With the bonus in play, every purchase is doubled.

Quintenz previously served in the regulator between 2017 and 2021, where he organized the Technology Advisory Committee. During his time as commissioner, he said a self-regulatory organization specific to the crypto industry could help oversee companies . Since leaving the agency, he joined a16z, where he became the head of policy . A16z was one of the major funders of Fairshake, a crypto-focused political action committee which poured close to $140 million into the 2024 election. Punchbowl News first reported the nomination. In a statement, Acting CFTC Chair Caroline Pham said, ""I congratulate my friend Brian Quintenz on his selection for CFTC Chairman. I worked with Brian on important initiatives that he led to success when he was a CFTC Commissioner. He will do the same for crypto and innovation. I look forward to supporting Brian and his leadership at the CFTC."" Industry groups likewise supported the nomination after news of it spread. Miller Whitehouse-Levine, the CEO of the DeFi Education Fund, a lobbying group, said the organization looked forward to working with him. ""Brian has a long track record of supporting DeFi and advocating for sound policies that will enable DeFi developers and users to thrive in the United States,"" he said in a statement. In recent years, the industry and Congress have pushed toward giving the CFTC greater oversight of the industry. Former CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam advocated for making the agency a primary market regulator for at least parts of the industry, including overseeing spot Bitcoin markets. A bill, the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, would have given the CFTC greater authority over crypto policy.

Chainlink’s Data Streams Go Live While Web3Bay Teases 4200% ROI,https://thecoinrise.com/big-news-for-web3-users-chainlinks-data-streams-go-live-while-web3bay-teases-4200-roi/,"Blockchain is moving past speculation as Chainlink’s ecosystem, LQUID PAY’s payment card, and Web3Bay’s Web3 marketplace drive real-world use and financial control. The Chainlink ecosystem has grown with the launch of Data Streams on Scroll, providing low-latency market data and improving the speed of DeFi apps. At the same time, Web3 users now have better control over their funds with LQUID PAY’s self-custody payment card, which enables crypto spending while merchants receive fiat instantly. However, the most promising financial shift is happening in Web3 commerce, led by Web3Bay (3BAY) . At $0.004562625 per 3BAY in presale stage 4, buyers are looking at a projected 4,200% return at launch. More than price increases, Web3Bay is designed for long-term benefits—holders earn passive income, and those who pay with 3BAY enjoy 5% discounts on purchases. Chainlink Ecosystem Boosts DeFi With Data Streams The Chainlink ecosystem has taken another leap forward by launching Chainlink Data Streams on the Scroll mainnet. Scroll, an Ethereum-based zero-knowledge rollup, now allows developers to access the Chainlink ecosystem’s fast market data, improving the speed and efficiency of DeFi apps. Since its mainnet debut in October 2023, Scroll has expanded rapidly, teaming up with Ether.fi, Alchemy Pay, and Nansen to strengthen its network. With Chainlink’s oracle now integrated, DeFi projects on Scroll can offer an experience as seamless as traditional banking, taking blockchain-powered finance to new heights. Web3 Users Gain More Financial Control With LQUID PAY’s Card Traditional banks have struggled to meet the needs of Web3 users, but LQUID PAY is bridging the gap with its new self-custody payment card. Unlike regular cards that depend on banks, this Visa-backed card lets users spend digital assets directly from their wallets while merchants receive fiat instantly. By cutting out high fees, long wait times, and crypto compatibility issues, LQUID PAY creates a smooth link between blockchain and real-world payments. This is especially useful in regions where crypto is widely used, but banking infrastructure is lacking. Web3Bay Offers Huge ROI for Early Birds– Get in Now! Web3Bay is making waves in the crypto market by changing how people buy digital assets. In just a few weeks, its presale raised over $1.1 million, selling more than 280 million tokens. With three presale stages already gone, stage 4 is almost sold out at $0.004562625 per 3BAY token. Yet, those who join now can still target a 4,200% return at launch, with even higher post-launch predictions. Beyond just price growth, Web3Bay also provides long-term earning potential. Web3Bay’s 3BAY token does more than help users buy digital assets—it gives transaction discounts, staking rewards, and governance rights. Paying with 3BAY grants a 5% discount, making it better than traditional fiat payments. But the real benefit comes from staking, where users can lock up their tokens and earn passive income while supporting the Web3Bay platform. In addition, Web3Bay is fully community-driven. Unlike centralized platforms that control how users buy digital assets, Web3Bay gives decision-making power to its users. Holders can vote on key platform changes, from transaction fees to new features and partnerships. The more involved a user is, the more they can earn—something traditional marketplaces can’t match. Wrapping Up! The Chainlink ecosystem’s latest integration with Scroll proves that DeFi apps can match traditional finance in speed and efficiency, bringing blockchain adoption closer to reality. Meanwhile, LQUID PAY is breaking down barriers between crypto and daily spending, allowing users to make payments without relying on banks. But the project truly changing Web3 finance is Web3Bay, a decentralized marketplace reshaping how users buy digital assets while increasing their earnings. With a potential 4,200% return at launch , staking rewards, transaction discounts, and governance rights, Web3Bay offers more than just short-term price gains—it’s a long-term earning opportunity. However, timing is crucial—those who act early on Web3Bay secure the best prices, the highest returns, and the biggest rewards before the next price jump.

Santiment acknowledged that the crypto community’s shift to Bitcoin could indicate market maturity, creating renewed optimism in the broader digital assets market. Shifting Attention To Bitcoin Data giant Santiment observed that the cryptocurrency sector has once again turned its attention to Bitcoin in the last few weeks as the meme coin frenzies waned. “The crypto community has largely shifted their attention to Bitcoin and other Layer 1 assets like Ethereum, Solana, Toncoin, and Cardano,” Santiment said in a post. The analytics firms noted that social discussions on Bitcoin and other Layer-1 protocols are on the rise, overtaking discussions on meme coins , which have been the talk of the crypto space for some time.

Meanwhile, top meme coins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe are being discussed less and less across social media,” Santiment said. The data giant attributed this shift to the “recent volatility, and speculative altcoin price dominance falling behind.” More Stable, Sustainable Market Santiment explained that investors’ shift of attention from meme coins to Bitcoin and Layer 1 only indicates “a more stable and sustainable market environment.” “Meme coins tend to attract speculative enthusiasm, often driven by hype, viral trends, and a gambling mindset rather than fundamental value. When these assets dominate discussions, it typically signals a phase of excess greed, where traders chase rapid, short-term gains without considering long-term viability,” the analytics firm said. Sanitment called Bitcoin and other Layer-1 protocols the “foundational infrastructure of the crypto space,” believing that the crypto community’s increased attention to these assets often reflects a “more mature and informed approach” by the crypto community. The data giant added that it also means that the community wants to prioritize “security, innovation, and real-world adoption.” “Layer 1 blockchains support smart contracts, decentralized applications, and network scalability—key drivers of long-term growth in the industry,” the analytics firm said. Healthier Market Cycle The analytics firms suggested that the investors’ regained attention towards Bitcoin and away from meme coin proves that the crypto community is more inclined to sustainability. “When traders pivot back to assets with strong utility and established market positions, it suggests a healthier market cycle. This shift encourages a more balanced ecosystem, reducing the risk of unsustainable price surges and crashes fueled purely by speculative mania,” Santiment said. As of this writing, Bitcoin is being traded at $97,825 per coin, up 0.2% in the last 24 hours. Its total market capitalization is nearly $2 trillion.

In a similar development, the SEC and Texas-based cryptocurrency company Lejilex have requested a delay in their upcoming oral arguments, originally set for February 20. They have also asked for any decisions on motions to be postponed until April 11. The parties mention that the change in leadership at the SEC and the work of the crypto task force could help resolve the case. https://twitter.com/EleanorTerrett/status/1889414664716771794 Lejilex filed a complaint against the SEC in February 2024. They argue that the SEC is wrongly claiming authority over most digital asset transactions in Texas and the U.S. The case was filed as Lejilex prepared to launch a new trading platform, seeking confirmation that transactions on the platform don’t need SEC registration. They hope to stop SEC rules they believe are hurting legitimate U.S. businesses. “The SEC’s rogue enforcement actions targeting our industry have paralyzed those of us who just want to build lawful businesses and technologies. Fear of rogue enforcement should not be a thing entrepreneurs are forced to experience,” the firm had said previously. They added, “We hope our action encourages the SEC to reconsider its regulatory approach, and we welcome them to work with us and our industry to ensure the most important technologies of the future are built here in America, under American laws, consistent with American values.”",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|BNB|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-12 04:05:42

The price is now moving lower and might decline below the $2.30 level. XRP price started a fresh decline from the $2.50 zone. The price is now trading below $2.420 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2.3650 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start a fresh increase if it clears the $2.50 resistance zone. XRP Price Dips Again XRP price struggled to settle above the $2.50 resistance zone. The price started another decline from the $2.52 level, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a move below the $2.45 level. The price dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.31 swing low to the $2.52 high. The price even spiked below the $2.40 level. However, there is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2.3650 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading below $2.420 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.440 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.50 level. The next resistance is $2.520. A clear move above the $2.520 resistance might send the price toward the $2.60 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.650 resistance or even $2.720 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.80. More Losses? If XRP fails to clear the $2.50 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.3620 level or 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.31 swing low to the $2.52 high. The next major support is near the $2.2650 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.2650 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.140 support. The next major support sits near the $2.050 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bullish zone.

What to Expect from Pi Network’s Open Network Launch Pi Network’s Open Network launch is set to bring a major transformation, allowing Pi to connect with external systems for the first time. This will open new opportunities for Pioneers and businesses, expanding Pi’s real-world use. External Connectivity and Expanded Utility With an Open Network, Pi’s blockchain will no longer be restricted, enabling transactions beyond its ecosystem. Pioneers will be able to interact with other compliant networks, making Pi more functional in the digital economy. Node Transition to Mainnet After launch, the firewall will be removed, allowing nodes to join the Mainnet blockchain. The Core Team will prioritize reliable contributors when transitioning nodes from Testnet to Mainnet. Secure and Verified Participation To ensure a safe environment, KYC verification will be required for Pioneers, while businesses must complete KYB verification. A list of KYB-verified businesses will be available on the Pi website. Pi’s Message for Remaining Pioneers Pioneers who haven’t completed KYC or migrated to Mainnet still have the chance to do so, even after the Open Network launch. They are encouraged to use Pi apps through the Pi Browser to help grow the ecosystem and increase Pi’s real-world use. The Open Network launch is confirmed and will not be delayed by external factors or changing market conditions. Pi Coin Price Surge 80% Since the announcement, Pi Coin’s price has surged by 80%, reaching $92 within hours.
