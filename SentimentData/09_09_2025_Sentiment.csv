Optimism price prediction for 2028 suggests the token could reach a maximum value of $11.14. In 2031, OP tokens will range between $27.9 and $33.66, with an average value of $28.88. Optimism’s (OP) commitment to innovation is highlighted by its support for Layer-3 solutions. These solutions enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Layer-2 chains, contributing to the expansive Optimism Superchain. The platform’s initiatives, including introducing custom gas tokens and Plasma mode aimed at reducing onboarding and operational costs, make it more accessible for new users and developers. As the market closely watches the price movements and growth trajectory of the token, can Optimism reach $10 soon? Let’s get into the OP price prediction for 2025 – 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Optimism Token OP Price $0.7528 Market Cap $1.33B Trading Volume $172.64M Circulating Supply 1.778B OP All-time High $4.85 (Mar 06, 2024) All-time Low $0.4005 (Jun 18, 2022) 24-hour High $0.7571 24-hour Low $0.7172 Optimism price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 4.98% 50-Day SMA $0.7228 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 51 (Neutral) Green Days 15/30 (50%) 200-Day SMA $0.7521 Optimism price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: OP could be testing a key breakout level soon. Momentum is shifting in favor of buyers. Optimism 1-day price chart Today’s candle surged to $0.7513, breaking above the mid-Bollinger Band at $0.7216 and closing near session highs. This move follows weeks of sideways action, suggesting a potential trend shift. OPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD histogram just flipped green while lines are crossing upward, reinforcing bullish momentum. The next major test is the upper Bollinger Band at $0.791, while support now sits around $0.721. A daily close back below $0.720 would weaken this breakout attempt, but holding current levels keeps $0.791 in sight. Optimism 4-hour price chart The 4-hour shows a sharp rally with volume expansion, pushing directly into $0.750 resistance. Immediate support lies at $0.732 and the 21-SMA at $0.722. If price consolidates above $0.732, continuation toward $0.770–$0.791 is likely. However, rejection here could trigger a pullback to retest $0.710 or $0.697 as demand zones. OPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView Optimism technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.7157 BUY SMA 5 $0.7121 BUY SMA 10 $0.7221 BUY SMA 21 $0.7252 BUY SMA 50 $0.7228 BUY SMA 100 $0.6665 BUY SMA 200 $0.7521 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.7000 BUY EMA 5 $0.7028 BUY EMA 10 $0.7116 BUY EMA 21 $0.7204 BUY EMA 50 $0.7107 BUY EMA 100 $0.7198 BUY EMA 200 $0.8603 SELL What to expect from Optimism? OP is at a breakout zone. Holding above $0.732 keeps momentum toward $0.791, while rejection at $0.750 risks a pullback into the $0.710–$0.722 demand area before bulls try again. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it’s risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you’re willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will Optimism reach $10? Yes, Optimism is projected to close up to $10 by 2028. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

Optimism historic price sentiment Optimism price history by Coingecko OP launched with an initial value of $4.57 on May 31 but dropped sharply in June due to the UST stablecoin de-pegging and LUNA collapse, closing June at $0.5434.

OP saw an eventful 2024, reaching an all-time high of $4.85 in March before sliding below $2.30 by mid-April. After a brief recovery to over $2.90 in May, it entered a bearish phase, trading at $1.82–$1.96 by July and $1.54–$1.62 by October. November brought a spark of hope with a peak at $2.60.

The market cap is $2.24 trillion, with a supply of 19.92 million BTC. Beyond price action, the backdrop for Bitcoin is being reshaped by three powerful forces: Nasdaq’s push into tokenized stocks, growing institutional accumulation, and a tightening technical structure that hints at an imminent breakout. Nasdaq has officially filed with the SEC to allow trading of tokenized U.S. equities, a landmark step in merging blockchain with traditional markets. The proposal would allow investors to choose between conventional stock trades and blockchain-backed tokens flagged at settlement. It's official. @Nasdaq filed with @SECGov to enable tokenized securities trading, a historic move by a U.S. traditional exchange.

At the same time, institutions and sovereign players continue to accumulate Bitcoin. Japanese firm Metaplanet added 136 BTC this week, raising its holdings to more than 20,000 BTC (over $2 billion).

And Michael Saylor’s Strategy acquired another 1,955 BTC, worth about $217 million, bringing its total stash to 638,460 BTC, cementing its position as the largest corporate holder worldwide. These combined moves signal that Bitcoin is not only being adopted at the financial infrastructure level but is also being increasingly absorbed by long-term holders, thereby reducing the available supply. MICHAEL SAYLOR JUST BOUGHT $217M $BTC AT $111,196 STRATEGY CURRENTLY HOLDS $71.58 BILLION OF BITCOIN AVERAGE PRICE: $73,880 pic.twitter.com/8X0G6RQ0py — Arkham (@arkham) September 8, 2025 What These Moves Mean for Bitcoin The implications of these events extend far beyond the headlines. Nasdaq’s tokenization leap could accelerate institutional adoption, providing new legitimacy for blockchain-based settlement and giving Bitcoin indirect exposure through increased trust in the ecosystem. Sovereign and corporate purchases underscore a growing conviction that Bitcoin can serve as a hedge against economic fragility and fiat currency devaluation, Metaplanet’s goal of reaching 210,000 BTC by 2027 underlines this strategic shift. Constrained supply —with more than 19.9 million BTC mined and fewer than 1.1 million left to be issued—means that institutional buying directly amplifies scarcity pressures. Together, these drivers create a foundation for Bitcoin to extend its gains higher, provided technical levels remain aligned. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Outlook: Triangle Breakout in Focus Bitcoin is consolidating in an ascending triangle, a bullish continuation pattern. Price is at $112,387, pressing against resistance at $113,400 and making higher lows since late August. The 50 SMA at $111,230 is support, while the 200 SMA at $112,777 is the immediate resistance. A sustained EMA crossover here would add fuel to the fire. Candlestick action has gone from indecision (Doji and spinning tops) to green closes, accumulation. The RSI at 62 remains firm but not overheated, suggesting upside room remains before momentum stretches. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview If Bitcoin breaks $113,400 with volume, the following upside targets sit at $115,400 and $117,150, levels highlighted by TradingView’s breakout path. Such a move would confirm that recent compression was the staging ground for renewed strength. Conversely, a failure to hold $111,500 risks a drop to $110,000 or $108,450; however, the rising trendline suggests that dips remain corrective rather than signs of reversal. For traders, a long entry above $113,400 presents an attractive setup, with stops placed below $111,200 to manage risk. A breakout could position Bitcoin for its next leg higher, potentially setting the stage for a push toward six-figure territory and even the $130,000 milestone in the coming cycle.

Related Reading: Why $50 XRP By December 2025 Isn’t ‘Hopium’ If ETFs Get Greenlight: Analyst According to reports, Lee says the market’s recent weakness is tied to the Federal Reserve’s reluctance to cut interest rates, while Schiff points to gold’s recent rally as a warning sign for Bitcoin. Schiff Points To Gold’s Rally In an X post, the gold bug Schiff highlighted that the yellow metal rose 10% over the last two months and reached a new high of $3,620. “Markets are forward-looking. That’s why gold is up 10% in advance of coming rate cuts,” he said, arguing that gold’s move shows traders expect easier policy ahead. Bitcoin, he added, has not followed gold’s lead, and that gap worries him. Permabull @fundstrat forecast Bitcoin will hit $200K by year-end, as Bitcoin is sensitive to Fed rate cuts. He said the Fed’s two-month pause is why Bitcoin hasn’t rallied over that time period. But gold rallied 10% during those two months, hitting a record $3,620 as he spoke. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) September 8, 2025 Lee’s $200,000 Call And His Explanation Tom Lee remains optimistic. He has argued that the influx of institutional investors gives Bitcoin new “counter-cyclical characteristics,” and that bigger players could push prices much higher over time. Based on reports, Lee blames the recent underperformance on the Fed and keeps the $200,000 figure in public view. His stance continues to make him one of Wall Street’s best-known permabulls – persons who maintain a perpetually optimistic outlook. Market Odds And Traders’ View Polymarket users appear unconvinced by Lee’s timetable. At press time, markets show an 8% chance of Bitcoin reaching $200k this year. The same markets place roughly an 8% chance on Bitcoin dropping below $70,000 by the end of 2025. Those odds suggest bettors are split and that headline targets are being treated with skepticism. Source: Polymarket A Broader Performance Check Schiff has also pointed to longer-term measurements. He noted that Bitcoin is down 16% against gold over the past four years, even though the cryptocurrency has posted strong gains versus the US dollar in that span. He warned that when “more air” comes out of the Bitcoin bubble, the four-year returns may look weak. The idea that the old four-year cycle tied to halvings may be fading was raised by other analysts in recent commentary, and that debate is ongoing. Related Reading: Tighter Premiums Put Crypto Treasuries On Risky Road, According To NYDIG What Comes Next For Bitcoin Schiff went further by saying Bitcoin is more likely to sink below $100k than to reach $200k, putting a cautious spin on the outlook. This view makes clear where Schiff stands: he treats gold’s rally as a forward signal about future policy and believes Bitcoin’s lag is not a short-term quirk but a structural concern. Lee’s counter is that institutional flows could change how Bitcoin moves over time.

Government Figures Show 21 BTC Were Added According to President Nayib Bukele and the country’s Bitcoin Office, the government bought 21 BTC on Sunday as a symbolic nod to Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap. Reports show the state has continued buying one BTC per day. The buying has been carried out since March 2024. Based on government figures and blockchain data, El Salvador now holds 6,313 BTC. The holdings are valued at about $700 million at current prices. Small in daily budget terms, these moves carry big political weight. Buying 21 bitcoin for Bitcoin Day. pic.twitter.com/3X4yKeiqzg — Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) September 7, 2025 Clash With IMF Loan Terms Reports have disclosed that the purchases confound a $1.4 billion IMF loan agreement signed in December last year. The deal required public entities to halt voluntary accumulation of Bitcoin and called for a freeze on further acquisitions under the finalized Extended Fund Facility. As part of the agreement, the government revised the Bitcoin Law so merchant acceptance is voluntary, agreed to liquidate the Fidebitcoin trust, and planned an exit from the Chivo wallet program. Yet purchases have continued. That has left IMF officials and outside observers watching whether future disbursements will be granted, since compliance reviews are scheduled through 2027. IMF Estimates And The Question Of Disclosure Based on an IMF report from March, the fund estimates El Salvador spent roughly $300 million on Bitcoin since 2021. At current market levels, those purchases represent more than $400 million in unrealized gains. But the IMF also noted that limited disclosure around transactions and holdings makes a full independent assessment difficult. Government disclosure of Bitcoin activity remains incomplete, even with public dashboards now in place. Reports have noted that unrealized gains could be affected if market prices decline. On Bitcoin, Security Moves And Public Transparency Late last month, the National Bitcoin Office redistributed holdings across multiple addresses, placing a cap of roughly 500 BTC per address. Officials said the change was motivated by concerns about future quantum computing threats . The new addresses were published on a public dashboard, a move intended to boost clarity over custody. Some market and industry observers welcome the dashboard. Others say the quantum argument sounds precautionary and that clearer audit standards are still needed. Bold But Divisive Four years after adopting Bitcoin as legal tender, El Salvador’s approach is still splitting opinion. Supporters say the country has built strong gains and stayed committed to its plan, while critics warn it has created problems with international lenders. The anniversary shows that El Salvador’s Bitcoin push is still seen by many as bold, but also deeply disputed.

This month, three projects stand out for their unique narratives and market strategies: BullZilla ($BZIL) , Dogwifhat, and Pudgy Penguins. Each one brings something different to the table, from explosive ROI potential to steady technical setups and powerful brand expansion. For financial students, analysts, and crypto enthusiasts, identifying the best meme coin presales in September 2025 is not just about chasing hype, it’s about understanding the mechanics that drive long-term growth. As this article explores BullZilla’s presale, Dogwifhat’s resilience, and Pudgy Penguins’ ecosystem, it becomes clear why these tokens belong to the best meme coin presales in September 2025 list. BullZilla — Forged on Ethereum, Fuelled by the HODL Furnace BullZilla presale currently rides at stage “Dead Wallets Don’t Lie.” This is the first phase of its launch on Ethereum. It trades at $0.00003241. So far, the presale has raised over $257k, with 900+ token holders already onboard. The returns are staggering: earliest participants saw 463 % ROI up until stage 2A. From stage 2A to listing, the current ROI is 16,164× (1,616,400 %) based on a projected listing price of $0.0052. BullZilla is built atop Ethereum, drawing on its security, liquidity, and DeFi ecosystem. This “forged in Ethereum’s blue fire” framework supports BullZilla’s standout feature: the HODL Furnace. This staking system encourages long-term commitment by offering a 70 % APY for locking $BZIL tokens. It works to convert “paper hands” into “diamond claws.” As rewards grow over time through vesting, committed holders earn increasing benefits. Investment Scenario An investment scenario: $2,500 placed at the presale price of $0.00003241 buys roughly 77 million $BZIL tokens. With a listing price of $0.0052, that stake could become worth about $400,400, a potential gain of nearly 160×. The powerful incentive to stake in the HODL Furnace means holders earn yield while possibly watching their holdings multiply. These design elements, Ethereum backbone, 70 % APY, vesting rewards, referral systems, tie Bull Zilla into mainstream DeFi and community growth. The presale mechanics, with dynamic scarcity and structured phases, dramatize potential explosive ROI while anchoring the project in security. Dogwifhat — Steady Consolidation, Poised for a Break Dogwifhat (WIF) trades in a tight range between $0.80 and $0.83, showing resilience as buyers defend $0.80 while resistance builds at $0.83. Intraday swings are shrinking, suggesting the token is consolidating before its next directional move. Technical indicators, like RSI near 46, point to neutral momentum. MACD histogram turning positive, whale buying, and growing liquidity support a cautious rebound setup. If $0.80 holds, WIF could rise toward $0.90–$1.00. But a breakdown risks deeper losses. Another outlook projects a strong rally: breaking above $0.94 could open the path to $2.50–$3.00 within weeks, implying a potential 200–266 % gain from its current level. Dogwifhat’s profile now blends stability and momentum. Its top-150 market cap and near-billion-token supply hint at institutional traction. The balance between supply and demand could set up a breakout if key resistance breaks. Pudgy Penguins — From NFTs to Brand Power & Market Might Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) stands out for its transformation from an NFT icon to a $1.9–$2.0 billion meme coin token, priced around $0.03. Analysts see technical patterns like cup-and-handle, wedge breakouts, and whale accumulation, suggesting gains toward $0.04–$0.06. Its expansion spans merchandise, IP development, animated series, toy licensing, and token utility on the Solana-based Abstract network. The Canary PENGU ETF proposal, holding mostly PENGU tokens and NFTs, signals institutional interest. Analysts highlight its deflationary and scarcity model, blended with brand loyalty and community engagement. One report underscores how Pudgy Penguins, XRPs, and BullZilla illustrate paths toward 100× gains. PENGU leverages storytelling and token burn mechanics; BullZilla combines presale engineering, staking, and DeFi pathways. Conclusion September’s crypto landscape is filled with noise, but separating signal from hype highlights the best meme coin presales in September 2025. BullZilla stands out with its Ethereum foundation and high-yield HODL Furnace, while Dogwifhat demonstrates disciplined consolidation with breakout potential, and Pudgy Penguins leverages brand loyalty for mainstream adoption. Together, they capture the spirit of meme coin evolution, blending innovation with risk. For those studying the market, tracking the best meme coin presales in September 2025 offers both a window into short-term strategies and lessons in long-term resilience. Whether through DeFi staking, technical analysis, or brand expansion, these tokens reflect why investors worldwide keep returning to the best meme coin presales in September 2025 for opportunities that can define portfolios. For More Information: BZIL Official Website Join BZIL Telegram Channel Follow BZIL on X (Formerly Twitter) Frequently Asked Questions for BullZilla Presale What is the HODL Furnace in BullZilla? It’s a staking mechanism on Ethereum where users lock $BZIL tokens to earn 70 % APY. The longer they stay staked, the more they earn through vesting. How realistic is the ROI figure for BullZilla stage-2A investors? Early investors saw around 463 % ROI up to stage 2A. From there to listing, the theoretical ROI is 16,164× if the listing price hits $0.0052. This assumes successful listing and market interest. Why might Dogwifhat rally significantly? Its tight consolidation between $0.80–$0.83, neutral RSI, and rising MACD suggest momentum is building. If resistance is broken, some forecasts project gains beyond $2.50. What drives Pudgy Penguins’ value? PENGU’s value stems from its NFT heritage, new token utility on Solana, brand licensing, animated media, and potential ETF inclusion—all supported by technical chart setups. Are these investments low risk? All involve market volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and speculative elements. This article is purely informational.

As a result, some key staff will leave the British auction house, according to sources close to the developments, casting doubt on the future of its on-chain initiatives. Christie’s will continue in the digital art sector The restructuring exercise has reportedly seen two employees let go at the end of last month. These include the department’s vice president of Digital Art, Nicole Sales Giles, who confirmed the news to Now Media. A spokesperson for Christie’s revealed in an official statement that the move was more of a strategic realignment as opposed to a total withdrawal from the space. “Christie’s has made a strategic decision to reformat digital art sales,” the spokesperson told Now Media. “The company will continue to sell digital art within the larger 20 th and 21 st Century Art category.” Christie’s spokesperson. The move reportedly marks a sharp reversal from the auction house’ stance just a few years ago. The auction house in March 2021 ignited an NFT bull run with a record shattering $69 million sale of digital art work – “Everydays: The First 5000 Days” by the artist Beeple. The sale was reportedly credited with legitimizing NFT and position traditional art institutions as key players in the nascent digital market. This also comes as part of wide-spread changes under the auction house’s new chief executive officer Bonnie Brennan, who took over as CEO in February this year. Dissolving the department has raised questions about the future of the auction house’s dedicated on-chain auction platform known as 3.0, which was launched in September 2022. The auction platform was a flagship of a project that the digital art team, which had also fronted exhibitions and partnerships among them “Getway” events with Now Media during Art Basel Miami and Frieze Seoul. The decision comes amid a challenging time for the digital art sector Christie’s strategic shift does not occur in isolation as it comes at a tough time for the digital art sector, which has seen platforms like MakersPlace, KnownOrigin, and Async Art shut down over the past two years amid a cooling market. For Christie’s, the rise in AI in art creation has also created problems for the auction house as the battle between artists and AI companies continue to intensify. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan, the auction house was in the middle of a storm in February when thousands of artists came together to stop the renowned auction house from sale of AI generated art arguing this was “mass theft” of human creativity. This was not the first nor last case, reflecting conflict over the use of AI technology in the art and entertainment industry with artists complaining over various issues like copyright infringement. One of the prominent cases involved a group of artists that took Meta to court in 2023 over allegations that the social media giant was misusing their books to train AI models, particularly Llama, which powers its chatbots. While the auction house is expected to continue to offer digital works, folding them into its broader contemporary art sales signals a move away from the standalone and specialized focus that defined the market’s peak.

The South Korean media outlet MoneyS reported that Tether officials are in the country to attend a domestic blockchain conference. But the executives are also reportedly planning meetings with a range of domestic fintech companies, including the neobank Toss. The headquarters of Shinhan Bank in central Seoul, South Korea. Tether officials met senior Shinhan executives at the building in the morning of September 8, with stablecoins on the agenda. (Source: Mobius6 [CC BY-SA 4.0]) Tether, Korean Banks Hold Stablecoin Talks The media outlet wrote that several Tether executives attended the Shinhan meeting, including Vice President Marco Dal Lago, the firm’s head of Global Expansions and Strategic Partnerships. Quynh Le, Tethers’ Regional Expansion Lead in the APAC area, and Andres Kim, the firm’s Bolivia-based Expansion Manager, were also in attendance. The summit is Shinhan Financial Group Chairman Jin Ok-dong’s second meeting with a major US stablecoin issuer in the space of a month. Jin and several rival South Korean bank heads met Heath Tarbert, the head of the USD Coin issuer Circle, during the latter’s visit to Seoul late last month . A Shinhan Financial Group official told media representatives that Shinhan and Tether “plan to continue discussing ways to build mutual networks.” South Korean lawmakers continue to push forward with plans to regulate KRW-pegged stablecoins. Evidently sensing an opportunity, both Tether and Circle have recently sent delegations to Seoul. Cho Young-seo, the Vice President of KB Kookmin Bank, is also set to meet Tether representatives on September 10. KEB Hana Financial Group and Woori Financial Group officials have already spoken to Tether officials about stablecoins. The parties held meetings on August 26.

MoneyS concluded that “global companies with established issuance and distribution networks” are likely to continue discussing collaboration options with domestic financial institutions until lawmakers come to an agreement. Allowing South Korean firms to issue stablecoins was a key manifesto pledge for President Lee Jae-myung ahead of June’s elections. Since Lee came to power, scores of major banks and leading IT firms have registered KRW-pegged stablecoin -related trademarks. These include the internet giants Kakao and Naver. Both of the firms operate widely used e-payment platforms. Experts believe stablecoin integration would be straightforward for both Kakao and Naver.

51416321,https://timestabloid.com/?p=82402,1757374259,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Beyond Wall Street: XRP’s Viable Paths in Remittances and Digital Economy,https://timestabloid.com/beyond-wall-street-xrps-viable-paths-in-remittances-and-digital-economy/,"When XRP entered the digital asset space more than a decade ago, its primary vision was to serve as a settlement rail for global banks, with the potential to replace or complement systems like SWIFT. Over time, however, major financial institutions have pursued other directions. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), proprietary payment networks, and internal settlement solutions have taken precedence, leaving XRP’s original “bank-focused” proposition in question. Critics often interpret this hesitation as a failure of XRP’s core mission. Yet, the assumption that XRP’s growth depends solely on Wall Street or large banks overlooks the broader landscape of opportunities. The asset’s utility extends beyond traditional finance and continues to expand across multiple industries. Retail Remittances as a Primary Driver One of XRP’s strongest applications lies in the global remittance sector. Millions of migrant workers regularly send money home to countries such as the Philippines, Mexico, Nigeria, and India. Traditional banking methods for these transfers are slow, expensive, and inaccessible to many. XRP offers faster settlements with significantly reduced costs, directly improving the lives of recipients. Practical examples already exist. In 2023, freelance platform goLance revealed that it uses XRP to pay workers in underserved markets. According to its CEO, Michael Brooks, delays and high charges imposed by traditional banks are unsustainable, especially for freelancers earning modest incomes. By adopting RippleNet and the XRP Ledger, goLance can transfer funds instantly, including during weekends, and at minimal cost. Considering that the global remittance industry is valued at approximately $860 billion annually, XRP’s role as a cost-effective bridge currency for individuals could represent one of its most sustainable avenues of adoption. Small Businesses and Corporate Payments Beyond individuals, small and medium-sized enterprises also face challenges with international transactions. Companies that depend on overseas suppliers or manage payroll for global workforces often require faster, cheaper alternatives to the conventional banking system. XRP’s ability to act as an intermediary currency for cross-border payments makes it a practical solution in these contexts. Japan’s SBI Holdings demonstrated this potential in 2023 by rolling out an XRP-powered remittance service targeting countries such as Vietnam, the Philippines, and Indonesia. Through this system, funds are transmitted in XRP and then converted into the recipient’s local currency, enabling efficient, low-cost transfers across Asia. XRP’s relevance also extends into the growing internet economy. Activities such as streaming payments, gaming transactions, and machine-to-machine transfers in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment benefit from a payment network that is both inexpensive and highly scalable. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 While stablecoins and Bitcoin’s Lightning Network have drawn early adoption in this area, XRP’s low fees and transaction speed position it as a viable competitor. Another source of strength for XRP lies in the development of the XRP Ledger (XRPL) . The ledger supports decentralized exchanges, automated market makers, tokenized assets, and compliance-oriented non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The presence of stablecoins within the XRPL ecosystem further reinforces the role of XRP as a native bridge asset, supporting liquidity and reducing transaction friction. A Diversification Asset in a CBDC-Dominated Future XRP may also serve as a diversification tool for investors in the future. Because a portion of XRP is permanently removed from circulation through transaction fees, its supply decreases gradually over time. This built-in scarcity could position it as a hedge in a global financial environment dominated by government-backed digital currencies, without requiring it to displace major currencies. The notion that XRP’s success depends exclusively on large banks no longer reflects its trajectory. While it may not fulfill its original vision of being the universal settlement rail for financial institutions, XRP’s relevance is reinforced by other applications—remittances, small business transactions, digital economy payments, ecosystem development, and investment diversification. Each of these areas individually may appear modest compared to the scale of global banking, but collectively they provide a diversified foundation for XRP’s continued growth. Even without full support from Wall Street, XRP retains multiple viable paths to long-term utility and adoption.

The chip giant, a foundational pillar of modern computing, is undergoing a significant transformation at its highest levels. This isn’t just a corporate reshuffle; it’s a strategic realignment under CEO Lip-Bu Tan, poised to redefine Intel’s future and its competitive edge in the global tech arena. Intel Leadership Undergoes a Strategic Overhaul: What’s Driving Tan’s Vision? Since Lip-Bu Tan took the helm as CEO in March, Intel has been charting a new course, marked by bold strategic moves and significant Intel leadership changes. The latest announcement signals a pivotal moment for the company, with Michelle Johnston Holthaus, formerly Chief Executive Officer of Intel Products, departing after over three decades. While she will remain a strategic adviser, her departure paves the way for a fresh wave of talent and a redefined organizational structure. This transition underscores Tan’s commitment to agile leadership and a renewed focus on innovation and execution. These shifts are not isolated incidents but part of a broader strategy to streamline operations and enhance Intel’s responsiveness to market demands. The company is clearly signaling a move towards a more specialized and customer-centric approach, aiming to accelerate product development cycles and reinforce its market position against intense competition. The Future is Fabricated: How Custom Silicon is Reshaping Intel’s Strategy One of the most exciting and forward-looking developments is the creation of a new central engineering group, specifically tasked with building a custom silicon business for external clients. This move represents Intel’s ambition to expand its reach beyond its traditional product lines, offering tailored solutions to a diverse customer base. This strategic pivot towards bespoke chip design and manufacturing is critical in an era where specialized chips are becoming increasingly vital for everything from advanced AI accelerators to high-performance computing and niche enterprise solutions. Heading this new group is Srinivasan ‘Srini’ Iyengar, a seasoned expert who joined Intel from Cadence Design Systems in July. His extensive expertise in chip design and verification will be instrumental in positioning Intel as a formidable player in bespoke silicon, directly competing with established foundry services and capitalizing on the burgeoning demand for highly optimized hardware solutions across various industries. New Faces, New Ambitions: Intel’s Play in the Evolving Semiconductor Industry Beyond internal transitions, Intel is injecting new blood into its senior ranks, bringing in top talent from across the competitive semiconductor industry . Kevork Kechichian, formerly of ARM, has joined as the head of Intel’s data center group, a crucial segment for cloud computing, enterprise solutions, and the foundational infrastructure that powers much of the digital economy. Jim Johnson has been appointed Senior Vice President and General Manager of Intel’s client computing group, overseeing the company’s core PC business, which remains a significant revenue driver. Furthermore, Naga Chandrasekaran, Chief Technology and Operations Officer of Intel Foundry, is taking on an expanded role, reinforcing the company’s commitment to its business unit that builds custom chips for outside customers. These strategic hires, combined with the new organizational structure, aim to accelerate product development, foster innovation, and strengthen Intel’s position against fierce competition, ensuring it remains at the forefront of technological advancement and market leadership. Beyond the Core: The Impact on AI Chips and High-Performance Computing The emphasis on custom silicon and the influx of specialized talent have significant implications for the future of AI chips . As artificial intelligence continues to permeate every industry, from healthcare to finance and autonomous systems, the demand for highly efficient, purpose-built AI accelerators is skyrocketing. Intel’s new central engineering group, with its focus on custom solutions, is perfectly positioned to cater to this need, designing chips optimized for specific AI workloads. This could enable significant breakthroughs in machine learning, deep learning, and edge AI, impacting everything from advanced data analytics to intelligent automation. For the broader technology ecosystem, including the infrastructure that supports cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies, Intel’s advancements in high-performance computing and AI indirectly support the underlying processing power and development of new innovations that rely on robust, efficient hardware. Steering the Giant: The Crucial Role of the Intel CEO in a Shifting Landscape The vision for these transformative changes is clearly being driven by Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan. His statement, “With Srini leading Central Engineering, we’re aligning innovation and execution more tightly in service to customers… We are laser-focused on delivering world-class products and empowering our engineering teams to move faster and execute with excellence,” highlights a clear strategy: customer-centric innovation and operational excellence. Tan’s leadership is not only about internal restructuring but also about navigating external pressures, such as the recent U.S. government plan to convert existing grants into a 10% stake in Intel. This deal was notably structured to penalize Intel if the company dropped below 50% ownership of its foundry unit, underscoring the strategic national importance of its manufacturing capabilities. These complex geopolitical and economic factors underscore the critical role of strong leadership in guiding Intel through a rapidly evolving and competitive global technology landscape, making Tan’s decisions paramount for the company’s future success. Intel’s recent leadership shake-up and strategic realignments signal a determined effort to reclaim its position at the vanguard of the technology world. By focusing on agile leadership, expanding its custom silicon capabilities, and bringing in top-tier talent, Intel under Lip-Bu Tan is poised for a significant transformation. These bold moves are critical for staying competitive in the rapidly evolving semiconductor industry and for meeting the escalating demands for advanced computing, particularly in the burgeoning fields of AI and high-performance computing. The coming years will reveal the full impact of these changes as Intel strives to build a ‘new Intel’ ready for the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century, solidifying its role as a key player in shaping the future of digital innovation.

51416683,https://timestabloid.com/?p=82399,1757374813,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Charts Don’t Lie: 3 Top Cryptos in September 2025 That Could Deliver High Upside Gains,https://timestabloid.com/charts-dont-lie-3-top-cryptos-in-september-2025-that-could-deliver/,"Every crypto cycle produces tokens that go from quiet whispers to center stage. In September 2025, analysts are pointing to three projects making waves: MoonBull, Brett, and Useless Coin. Each is attracting different kinds of attention, but all are on the radar for traders hunting big upside. What makes this list interesting? These aren’t random picks. Each of these meme coins has a unique hook, whether it’s the energy of a new launch, the community pull of a mascot, or the humor of a satire project. Let’s break down why these names are being counted among the top cryptos in September 2025. 1. MoonBull: Whitelist Energy That’s Hard to Ignore MoonBull ($MOBU) is bringing an unstoppable mix of bull momentum and meme energy to Ethereum. This isn’t just another meme coin floating on hype. It’s designed with exclusivity at its core. The whitelist is live now, and it’s where the real opportunity lies. Whitelist members get access to perks no one else will touch: Entry at the lowest possible price Secret staking rewards for those holding early Bonus token allocations that stack value Private hints on the roadmap, only for insiders These are strictly capped benefits. Once the whitelist closes, no second chances will appear, making MoonBull one of the most top cryptos in September 2025 for early movers. Why Scarcity Matters in MoonBull’s Case Here’s the deal: scarcity always fuels demand. When access is limited, the psychology of wanting in becomes even stronger. Traders have seen this movie before. A handful of past whitelist projects delivered massive upside within months simply because early access was reserved for the few who moved quickly. That’s what MoonBull is replicating. To secure a spot, traders need to drop an email into the whitelist form. Once approved, they’ll receive a private notification revealing the exact Stage One launch date before the public even knows. Bulls are already lining up. 2. Brett: The Base Community’s Mascot With Staying Power Brett, the ERC-20 token living on Coinbase’s Base layer-2, has become more than a meme. Inspired by the “Brett” character from Matt Furie’s Boys’ Club comic, it’s now the unofficial mascot of Base. That cultural anchor has given it a strong foundation with a community that thrives on identity and inside jokes. The token’s rise has been steady. Brett appeals to traders who enjoy the blend of nostalgia and new tech, a comic-based meme coin rooted in one of the fastest-growing ecosystems. Base itself is gaining traction, and Brett is positioned as its standout. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because Brett combines familiarity with fresh infrastructure. Its ability to rally a crowd around culture makes it one of the more top cryptos in September 2025 for those betting on community-driven growth. 3. Useless Coin: The Satirical Play That Keeps Gaining Attention On the other end of the spectrum sits Useless Coin. Built on Solana, this project does exactly what its name suggests – nothing. No roadmap, no governance, no utility. The satire is the point. It’s a critique of overhyped projects that promise the moon but never deliver. And strangely enough, that’s what’s making it valuable. The community embraces the irony, leaning into the absurdity of speculation itself. Traders see Useless Coin as a pure meme experience, thriving on culture, humor, and community banter rather than technical promises. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because it represents the raw speculative spirit that often drives meme markets. Its parody stance makes it one of the top cryptos in September 2025 worth watching, precisely because it refuses to play by the rules. Final Thoughts Based on the latest research, the top cryptos in September 2025 are MoonBull , Brett, and Useless Coin. Each has carved out its own lane: MoonBull with its exclusive whitelist perks, Brett with its mascot status on Base, and Useless Coin with its satire-driven speculation. For traders eyeing explosive upside, the common thread here is culture mixed with timing. From exclusivity to community strength to parody, these projects highlight how meme energy still drives crypto markets in unexpected ways.

Presales are usually announced on official project websites, crypto news outlets, or launchpad platforms. Always verify links and official sources before committing. What is the best crypto presale to invest in 2025? Analysts currently highlight MoonBull as one of the strongest presales of 2025 because of its whitelist access and limited supply. Which meme coin to buy right now? Traders are keeping close eyes on MoonBull for presale access, while Brett and Useless Coin are being watched for cultural and community-driven growth. Which meme coin will explode in 2025? There’s no guaranteed outcome, but MoonBull’s whitelist model, Brett’s Base community backing, and Useless Coin’s parody momentum make them strong contenders. Do meme coins have a future? Yes. Meme coins continue to thrive by blending culture, community, and humor. While speculative, they often lead new trends in crypto adoption and trader attention.

Especially intriguing is the buzz around Layer Brett , an innovative Layer 2 token currently undergoing a presale that’s capturing serious attention, quickly raising capital, and promising early adopters a unique blend of meme-fueled energy and undeniable blockchain utility. This isn’t just another flash in the pan; it’s a genuine contender. Layer Brett (LBRETT) is the best-looking crypto token for the future Layer Brett (LBRETT) is not merely another memecoin riding on a fleeting trend. This ERC-20 token is a next-generation Layer 2 beast built squarely on Ethereum, designed to fuse viral meme culture with tangible blockchain scalability. Think of it as Brett (original), but on steroids, with purpose. It’s an escape from the utility-free origins of its namesake, promising a robust ecosystem featuring high-yield staking rewards, seamless interoperability, and a truly community-driven roadmap. It aims to deliver real-world solutions without sacrificing the infectious energy of those memes. Layer Brett leverages cutting-edge Layer 2 technology to sidestep Ethereum’s notorious congestion. This means transactions happen off-chain, blazing fast, while still retaining the ironclad security and decentralization of the leading Ethereum network. It’s a game-changer. What does this mean for you? Blazing-Fast Transactions: Say goodbye to endless waiting times. Layer Brett offers near-instant settlements for everything from trading to staking. Ultra-Low Gas Fees: Tired of high fees eating into your gains? This Layer 2 solution slashes costs to mere pennies, making micro-transactions viable for everyone. Hyper-Incentivized Staking: Early buyers can stake their LBRETT tokens right away, locking in incredible APYs at 850%. That’s a serious passive income opportunity. Community-First Approach: Layer Brett isn’t just a technical marvel; it’s a movement. With a $1 million giveaway planned, it’s actively building a vibrant, engaged community from the ground up. Cardano (ADA) price prediction and Chainlink (LINK) market caps are already astronomical While Cardano (ADA) price prediction and Chainlink (LINK) have been hot topics for years, and they continue to be crucial players in the Web3 space, their growth trajectories often operate on different principles. Cardano, with its slow and steady development, aims to deliver institutional-grade DeFi solutions and smart contracts. Chainlink, the undisputed oracle king, powers decentralized data feeds across countless blockchains. Both are foundational, yes, but their market caps are already astronomical, for investors seeking the next big crypto, tokens like ADA offer distinct risk-reward profiles. They offer stability, but Layer Brett is geared for explosive early growth that more established assets simply cannot replicate. Layer Brett (LBRETT) is becoming the next 100x altcoin Now, about the price. When you compare Layer Brett ’s current presale price of $0.0055 to behemoths like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, or even Pepe, the potential for exponential growth is impossible to ignore. These established meme coin giants began small, often with little to no utility, before skyrocketing in value to the billions. Layer Brett, however, launches with a clear, tech-backed advantage: it’s a Layer 2 blockchain from day one. Analysts are whispering about Layer Brett becoming the next 100x altcoin, especially as it stands out against the purely speculative nature of Brett (original). The market for low-cap crypto gems is always ripe, and Layer Brett is poised to be a top gainer in the upcoming crypto bull run of 2025. Don’t let this best crypto presale slip through your fingers. Be part of the movement that truly defines the future of decentralized finance. Don’t miss this top meme coin opportunity.

On-chain flows show a $26M net outflow, hinting at accumulation despite fragile sentiment. Key levels: $4,200 as risk pivot, $4,500 as breakout trigger for bullish momentum. By Jainam Mehta Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) is holding steady around $4,314, attempting to stabilize after several weeks of rangebound movement. On the 4-hour chart, the token is pressing against the lower boundary of a descending triangle formation, with the $4,200–$4,250 zone acting as a firm support base. This level has been tested repeatedly without breaking, underscoring strong demand absorption. The Parabolic SAR remains above price action, reflecting ongoing pressure from sellers. Momentum, however, is neutralizing. The RSI hovers at 49, showing little conviction from either buyers or sellers. Analysts note that Ethereum is in a “wait-and-see” phase where rallies fade quickly and pullbacks are met with buying interest. ETH price dynamics (Source: TradingView) If ETH can clear the $4,450–$4,500 ceiling, the market could flip decisively bullish, with the potential to target $4,800. Conversely, a failure to defend $4,200 risks opening a move toward the $3,800–$3,900 liquidity pocket, which has historically served as a launchpad for recovery. On-chain flows and market tone Exchange flow data mirrors the cautious market structure. On September 8, Ethereum recorded a $26 million net outflow from exchanges, suggesting investors are moving tokens into cold storage. Such behavior often aligns with accumulation phases and price resilience. Still, opportunistic selling has emerged during recent dips, with inflows accompanying short-term declines. This duality reflects a fragile balance: long-term investors appear to be building positions, while shorter-term traders are quick to take profits. Market sentiment remains split. Intraday traders are watching the compression closely, while swing investors are focused on whether the $4,200 floor or $4,500 ceiling gives way first. Futures positioning has moderated after a strong summer, reinforcing the sense that Ethereum is preparing for a directional expansion. Outlook hinges on breakout levels Ethereum’s near-term trajectory is defined by two critical thresholds: $4,200 as the risk pivot and $4,500 as the breakout trigger. A decisive push above $4,500 could invite bullish momentum toward $4,800, while a breakdown risks pulling ETH toward the $3,800 pocket. In prior coverage, Ethereum was highlighted as coiling near $4,250, with traders awaiting clarity on flows and momentum. The latest stabilization above $4,300 shows resilience, but the token remains locked in a range where direction will depend on whether buyers or sellers seize control in the coming sessions.

According to on-chain data from CryptoQuant, this represents the largest whale distribution since July 2022, adding significant selling pressure to the market. The sell-off came from large holders controlling between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC. These whales had accumulated more than 270,000 BTC between April and August, only to reverse course and flood the market with supply. This aggressive profit-taking pushed Bitcoin prices below $109,000, marking a 5.5% monthly decline and breaking a four-month winning streak. Market Shows Signs of Bitcoin (BTC) Stabilization Despite the heavy distribution, recent activity suggests selling pressure may be cooling. Whale movements peaked on September 3, when more than 95,000 BTC changed hands in a single week, the largest shift since March 2021. However, the pace has since slowed to around 38,000 BTC per week as of September 6. Currently, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading in a narrow range between $111,700 and $112,000, signaling that some stability is returning. Analysts caution, however, that a looming “head and shoulders” pattern and an unfilled FVG at $114,000 could precede another sharp downturn. If this resistance zone triggers fresh selling, BTC could slide back toward $106,000, testing critical support levels. Institutional Buyers Take Advantage While whales have been reducing exposure, institutional investors appear to be absorbing some of the pressure. Corporate buyers and ETF inflows have provided what analysts call a “structural counterbalance” to whale dumping. For example, Japanese firm Metaplanet Inc. recently added 136 BTC to its treasury, bringing its total holdings to more than 20,000 BTC. Nick Ruck, Director at LVRG Research, notes that ETF-driven demand and corporate accumulation could stabilize Bitcoin even amid aggressive whale selling. However, the broader outlook remains tied to macroeconomic conditions, especially the Federal Reserve’s upcoming September 17 meeting, where interest rate decisions could significantly sway liquidity in risk markets. With Bitcoin still down about 11% from mid-August highs near $124,000, traders remain split: will institutional buying outweigh whale pressure, or is a deeper crash on the horizon?

Prices are swinging, new technologies are proving themselves in real time, and the search for the best crypto investments is at an all-time high. Certain projects are beginning to separate from the noise by showing adoption, liquidity, and relevance that extends beyond speculation. Rather than focusing on daily price pumps, this guide explores four names that are commanding attention: BlockDAG, Cardano, XRP, and Sui. Each represents a different strand of growth, whether it’s presale scale, regulatory clarity, or developer-driven adoption. Together, they highlight where the most promising opportunities lie in 2025. 1. BlockDAG: Nearly $400M Raised With Flat-Rate Presale Pricing BlockDAG is rewriting expectations around presales. With nearly $400 million raised and over 25.7 billion coins sold, it has already eclipsed the fundraising scale of many historical projects. At its Deployment Event in Singapore, BlockDAG introduced a flat-rate presale price of $0.0013 for the final 30 days before launch. This new model replaced confusing bonus tiers with a fair, transparent, and equal-access system, ensuring that every participant has the same opportunity to buy in before the $0.05 listing. The shift reflects BlockDAG’s commitment to accessibility, loyalty, and long-term alignment with its community. Visibility is another factor driving BlockDAG . Adoption metrics prove this isn’t empty marketing. The X1 mobile mining app counts over 3 million users, while thousands of X10 miners are already shipping globally. More than 4,500 developers are building 300+ dApps within its ecosystem. Whales are also active, with leaderboard buys of $4.4M and $4.3M, reinforcing confidence. Taken together, BlockDAG is more than hype; it’s one of the best crypto investments of 2025, backed by scale, adoption, and real-world visibility. 2. Cardano (ADA): Consistency and Scaling Power Cardano continues to prove itself as one of the most steady performers in crypto. Trading near $0.85, ADA has held strong support in the $0.75–$0.77 zone while eyeing resistance closer to $1.00. Scalability upgrades such as Hydra and Ouroboros Leios are laying the groundwork for higher throughput, while more than 300 decentralized applications are already live on the network. Large holders have recently accumulated 150M+ ADA, suggesting confidence in its roadmap. Speculation around a possible Cardano ETF has only added fuel to the discussion. For those mapping out the best crypto investments, Cardano’s mix of academic rigor, active development, and whale accumulation keeps it firmly in the spotlight. 3. XRP: Legal Clarity Meets Real-World Payments After years of regulatory uncertainty, XRP is finally operating with clear direction. Trading around $3.20, it has reclaimed strength as a settlement layer for cross-border payments, supported by multiple banking and fintech partnerships. The conclusion of its legal battles has restored focus on adoption rather than courtroom drama. With transactions that are fast and inexpensive, XRP continues to serve as a practical tool for global finance. This unique position is why it’s frequently listed among the best crypto investments in 2025. The combination of utility, regulatory clearance, and institutional ties gives it staying power few rivals can match. 4. Sui (SUI): Developer Growth and Market Buzz Sui is one of the most talked-about new networks, currently priced near $3.47 with a market cap of about $12 billion. Trading volumes hover close to $1 billion daily, and its circulating supply sits at 3.51 billion coins out of a 10B max cap. What sets Sui apart is its developer focus. A partnership with Alibaba Cloud has introduced an AI coding assistant for builders working in the Move programming language, making it easier to create applications on the chain. This has translated into growing traction in NFTs, gaming, and DeFi. For those seeking the best crypto investments in 2025, Sui’s combination of adoption signals and technical strength makes it a serious contender. Final Word BlockDAG, Cardano, XRP, and Sui highlight the key drivers shaping 2025: presale dominance, steady upgrades, regulatory clarity, and developer ecosystems. Among them, BlockDAG stands out for its nearly $400M presale, whale confidence, and the introduction of $0.0013 flat-rate pricing at its Deployment Event a move designed for fairness, transparency, and equal opportunity. Cardano provides a balance of stability and scalability, XRP offers proven utility under regulatory clarity, and Sui is capturing developer energy in next-generation applications. Together, these projects outline where the best crypto investments of 2025 are forming and why now is the time to pay close attention.

51417463,https://timestabloid.com/?p=82412,1757376034,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Shiba Inu (SHIB) Flashes Death Cross. Here’s The Implication,https://timestabloid.com/shiba-inu-shib-flashes-death-cross-heres-the-implication/,"Shiba Inu has drawn renewed attention after technical indicators revealed the formation of a death cross on its daily chart over the weekend. A death cross occurs when the 50-day moving average falls below the 200-day moving average, a signal that is generally interpreted as pointing to declining momentum and the potential for a price retracement. Second Death Cross in 2025 This is the second time the pattern has appeared on Shiba Inu’s chart this year. The first instance emerged in February and was followed by months of weak performance that eventually drove the token’s value down to the $0.00001 level in June. The timing of the latest development has caught some market observers by surprise. Only a month earlier, Shiba Inu formed a golden cross , which is usually taken as a bullish indicator. That event initially lifted investor expectations for a stronger rally. However, the positive sentiment proved short-lived as broader market conditions turned unfavorable. September has historically been one of the more challenging months for the cryptocurrency sector, and this year has been no exception. Ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, coupled with seasonal weakness, has added pressure on major digital assets. These factors reduced the impact of the golden cross and contributed to renewed selling activity in Shiba Inu. Despite these headwinds, the token briefly advanced to $0.000013 on August 29 before losing momentum in early September as the overall market trend shifted downward. With conflicting signals from recent chart patterns, traders are focused on Shiba Inu’s near-term movement. If the token manages to break above its daily moving average, bullish participants may aim for resistance levels between $0.000014 and $0.000016. On the other hand, if downward pressure intensifies, price action could mirror the decline that followed February’s death cross, making $0.00001 an important support level to watch. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 As of the latest update, Shiba Inu is priced at $0.00001291, reflecting a 4.03% increase over the past 24 hours and a 6.58% gain for the week. Since the beginning of September, the asset has advanced by 2.87%, bringing its average monthly performance to 6.94%. Market Activity and Token Burns Trading activity has also shown notable growth. Shiba Inu’s 24-hour trading volume rose by 39%, reaching $143.94 million. This uptick suggests that interest in the token remains strong despite the uncertain technical outlook. At the same time, the project’s burn rate recorded a sharp increase. Over the past 24 hours, token burns surged with approximately 1.3 million SHIB permanently removed from circulation across nine transactions. This mechanism, while relatively small in scale compared to the total supply, continues to be monitored by the community as a long-term support factor. The reemergence of a death cross on Shiba Inu’s chart has revived concerns about the token’s immediate direction.

Throughout past bull cycles, this band has historically served as a crucial support level, with price retesting it during corrections and bouncing off it to continue its upward trend. Why This Level Matters For Bitcoin Uptrend In an X post, full-time crypto trader and investor, Daan Crypto Trades, has pointed out that Bitcoin is currently sitting directly on top of the Bull Market Support Band. This level has long been regarded as one of the most reliable high-timeframe momentum indicators. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Key Support Amid Gravestone Doji – $120,000 Hangs In Balance Daan Crypto Trades noted that while Bitcoin has seen short-term consolidation at or even slightly below this band, it has never experienced a prolonged detachment for more than a week or two during a bull market. The broader market structure remains intact as long as Bitcoin continues to print higher highs and higher lows on the larger timeframe. However, any subsequent dips that occur while this structural integrity is maintained are generally seen as areas of interest and potential buying opportunities for investors. The Role Of Liquidity In Driving Bitcoin’s Next Move Bitcoin is showing the first bearish divergence against the Global M2 Money supply since the cycle lows began, and signaling a potential slowdown in momentum. According to Saint Pump, a market expert, a one-month liquidity pullback is expected in late September, coinciding with the Federal Reserve (Fed) anticipated rate cut amid job weakness. Related Reading: Analyst Says All Bitcoin Price Uptrend Are Duds Unless This Happens This confluence of a bearish technical signal and a macroeconomic liquidity event suggests that BTC’s recent poor price action since July and divergence with global liquidity will continue leading to a period of choppy price action. In addition, there will be volatile trading until global liquidity conditions improve in late October. Adding to the short-term pressure, October also marks the expected end of the four-year cycle, which historically brings additional selling activity. Despite these headwinds, no major cycle top or euphoria signals are evident. Saint Pump noted that the Trump Administration may unleash a monetary bazooka through a Fed takeover to stimulate the economy ahead of the midterms. As a result, this cycle could extend into late 2026, until Inflation fears resurface once the Fed overdoes it due to political pressures. From a technical perspective, the best bid scenario in a sell-off lies between $93,000 and $98,000, aligning with a retest of the weekly 55 Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which has sustained the bull trend since last year. While short-term volatility is expected, the broader uptrend remains structurally sound.

Currently, a crucial barometer for these sentiments, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , stands at a neutral 48. This reading, a slight dip from yesterday, signifies a balanced state in the market, where neither extreme optimism nor pervasive panic dominates. For many investors, understanding this index is key to navigating the often-volatile world of digital assets. Unpacking the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: How Does It Work? Ever wondered how market sentiment is quantified? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , provided by Alternative, aggregates various data points to give us a clear picture. It operates on a simple scale from 0 (representing Extreme Fear) to 100 (signifying Extreme Greed). This comprehensive index isn’t just a random number. It’s meticulously calculated based on six key factors, each contributing to its final score: Volatility (25%): Measures the current market’s price fluctuations compared to average values. High volatility often signals fear. Trading Volume (25%): Analyzes current trading volumes and market momentum. Strong, sustained buying volume can indicate greed. Social Media Mentions (15%): Scans various platforms for keyword mentions and sentiment analysis, reflecting public perception. Surveys (15%): While currently paused, these polls historically gauged investor sentiment directly. Bitcoin’s Market Cap Dominance (10%): An increasing dominance often suggests fear, as investors might be moving into the perceived safety of Bitcoin. Google Search Volume (10%): Tracks search queries related to cryptocurrencies, with sudden spikes often indicating panic (fear) or curiosity (greed). Together, these elements paint a holistic picture of the market’s emotional state, making the Crypto Fear & Greed Index an invaluable tool. Why Does a Neutral Crypto Fear & Greed Index Reading Matter? A neutral reading, like the current 48, indicates a period of market indecision. Unlike the extremes of “Extreme Fear,” which often presents buying opportunities, or “Extreme Greed,” which might signal an impending correction, neutrality suggests a wait-and-see approach among investors. During neutral phases: There’s less panic selling or impulsive buying. The market lacks a strong directional bias. It can precede significant moves, as sentiment builds towards one extreme or the other. This balance provides a window for careful analysis rather than reactive trading. It’s a moment for investors to reassess their strategies without the pressure of overwhelming market emotions. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights from the Crypto Fear & Greed Index So, how can you leverage the current neutral stance of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index ? It’s important to remember that this index is a sentiment indicator, not a direct trading signal. However, it offers crucial context for your investment decisions. Consider these actionable insights: Avoid Emotional Decisions: A neutral index helps to keep emotions in check. Instead of chasing pumps or panic selling, focus on your long-term investment plan. Conduct Deeper Research: With no clear market direction, this is an excellent time to research projects, understand fundamentals, and identify potential opportunities without the noise of extreme sentiment. Prepare for Shifts: Neutrality rarely lasts forever. Use this period to prepare for potential shifts towards fear or greed. Having a plan for both scenarios can prevent impulsive reactions. Diversify Your Portfolio: A balanced market sentiment reinforces the importance of a diversified portfolio, reducing exposure to single asset volatility. Ultimately, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a valuable lens through which to view market psychology, helping you make more informed and rational choices. Challenges and Limitations: What the Index Doesn’t Tell You While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a powerful tool, it’s not a crystal ball. It’s crucial to understand its limitations: Lagging Indicator: The index reflects past and current sentiment, not future price movements. It doesn’t predict what will happen tomorrow. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic news, regulatory changes, or technological breakthroughs can significantly impact crypto prices, and these aren’t directly captured by the index. Bitcoin-Centric Bias: While it uses overall market data, Bitcoin’s dominance heavily influences its calculation. Altcoin-specific sentiments might differ. Therefore, always combine insights from the Crypto Fear & Greed Index with fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and a broad understanding of the macroeconomic landscape. It’s just one piece of a much larger puzzle. Conclusion: Mastering Market Emotions with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The current neutral reading of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 48 offers a unique opportunity for thoughtful engagement with the crypto market. It’s a reminder that while emotions drive much of the short-term price action, informed decision-making based on a blend of tools and analysis remains paramount. By understanding how the index works, interpreting its signals, and recognizing its limitations, investors can navigate the exciting yet unpredictable world of cryptocurrencies with greater confidence and strategic foresight. Use this period of neutrality to refine your approach and prepare for whatever the market brings next. Frequently Asked Questions About the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Q1: What does a “Neutral” reading on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index mean? A1: A neutral reading, like the current 48, suggests that neither extreme fear nor extreme greed is dominating the cryptocurrency market. It indicates a period of balanced sentiment, indecision, or a “wait-and-see” approach among investors. Q2: How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index calculated? A2: The index is calculated based on a weighted average of several factors: volatility (25%), trading volume (25%), social media mentions (15%), surveys (15%), Bitcoin’s market cap dominance (10%), and Google search volume (10%). Q3: Can I use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index as a direct buy or sell signal? A3: No, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is primarily a sentiment indicator, not a direct trading signal. While extreme readings can hint at potential opportunities (e.g., “Extreme Fear” for buying), it should always be combined with other forms of analysis, such as fundamental and technical research, for informed decision-making. Q4: What are the limitations of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A4: Its limitations include being a lagging indicator (reflecting past/current sentiment, not predicting the future), not directly accounting for broader macroeconomic factors or regulatory changes, and having a slight bias towards Bitcoin’s influence on overall market sentiment. Q5: What should investors do during a neutral Crypto Fear & Greed Index period? A5: A neutral period is ideal for thoughtful analysis rather than impulsive action. Investors can use this time to conduct deeper research into projects, reassess their portfolio strategy, prepare for potential market shifts, and avoid making emotional decisions based on short-term fluctuations.

This development marks a significant step forward for Upbit and the broader blockchain ecosystem, promising enhanced scalability and efficiency for users. Reported by BWE News, the project already has a dedicated website live, showcasing Upbit’s commitment. Furthermore, Dunamu, Upbit’s parent company, has taken the proactive step of filing a trademark for the Upbit Giwa name, solidifying its presence in this innovative space. What is Upbit Giwa and Why Does it Matter? At its core, Upbit Giwa is a Layer 2 blockchain built upon the OP Stack. For those new to the concept, Layer 2 solutions are designed to address the inherent limitations of primary blockchains (Layer 1s) like Ethereum, particularly concerning transaction speed and cost. Think of it like this: if Layer 1 is a busy highway, Layer 2 is an express lane built on top, handling a high volume of traffic quickly and efficiently before settling the final results back on the main highway. This architecture allows for faster, cheaper transactions without compromising the security of the underlying Layer 1 blockchain. The significance of Upbit Giwa cannot be overstated. By leveraging a Layer 2 solution, Upbit aims to provide a smoother, more cost-effective experience for its users, opening doors for more complex and high-frequency decentralized applications (dApps). The Power Behind Upbit Giwa: Understanding the OP Stack The choice of the OP Stack for building Upbit Giwa is a strategic one. The OP Stack is a standardized, open-source development stack that allows developers to create their own Layer 2 blockchains, often referred to as ‘Optimistic Rollups.’ Here’s why the OP Stack is a powerful foundation: Modularity: It offers a flexible framework, allowing Upbit to customize its network to meet specific needs. Security: It inherits the robust security of the underlying Layer 1 blockchain, typically Ethereum. Developer Friendly: Its standardized nature makes it easier for developers to build and deploy applications. This technical foundation positions Upbit Giwa to be a robust and reliable platform, capable of handling significant transaction volumes and fostering innovation within its ecosystem. What Benefits Does Upbit Giwa Bring to Users? The introduction of Upbit Giwa is poised to deliver several tangible benefits to cryptocurrency users, particularly those interacting with the Upbit ecosystem. These advantages are crucial for driving wider adoption and improving the overall user experience. Key benefits include: Reduced Transaction Fees: Layer 2 solutions significantly lower the cost of transactions compared to Layer 1. Increased Transaction Speed: Users can expect faster confirmations and quicker settlement times for their activities. Enhanced Scalability: The network can handle a much higher volume of transactions, reducing congestion during peak times. New Possibilities: Lower fees and higher speeds enable new types of dApps and use cases that might be too expensive or slow on Layer 1. Ultimately, Upbit Giwa aims to make blockchain technology more accessible and practical for everyday use, aligning with the broader industry goal of mainstream adoption. The Road Ahead for Upbit Giwa and Layer 2 Innovation While the announcement of Upbit Giwa is exciting, it’s just the beginning. The success of any new blockchain network hinges on adoption, developer engagement, and continuous innovation. Upbit’s strong market position in South Korea provides a solid launchpad, but the real work of building a thriving ecosystem lies ahead. The broader trend of Layer 2 development is accelerating, with many projects competing to offer the best solutions. Upbit Giwa will need to demonstrate its unique value proposition and foster a vibrant community to stand out. As the crypto landscape evolves, expect to see more updates on Upbit Giwa’s development, partnerships, and the dApps that choose to build on its network. This initiative underscores Upbit’s commitment to staying at the forefront of blockchain technology and providing cutting-edge services to its users. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Upbit and Blockchain The unveiling of Upbit Giwa represents a significant milestone for Upbit and a promising development for the entire blockchain community. By embracing Layer 2 technology built on the robust OP Stack, Upbit is paving the way for a more scalable, efficient, and user-friendly cryptocurrency experience. This strategic move not only enhances Upbit’s offerings but also contributes to the ongoing evolution of decentralized finance and Web3. As we look to the future, Upbit Giwa has the potential to become a pivotal player, driving innovation and making blockchain technology more accessible to millions.

This isn’t just another transaction; it’s a major institutional endorsement that could redefine perceptions of Dogecoin. New York Stock Exchange-listed Cleancore Solutions (ZONE) has officially made its first substantial move into the meme coin market, signaling a bold strategic direction. This article dives into the details of this monumental acquisition and its potential ripple effects across the crypto landscape. Understanding Cleancore’s Strategic DOGE Purchase Cleancore Solutions, a publicly traded entity, recently made headlines with its acquisition of 285 million DOGE tokens. Valued at an impressive $68 million, this transaction was initially reported by Crypto Briefing. This move is not an isolated event; rather, it’s the initial phase of a much larger, ambitious plan. Cleancore had previously announced its intention to accumulate a significant portion of the total DOGE supply. The company’s long-term vision involves securing 5% of all Dogecoin in circulation. Their immediate objective is to reach one billion DOGE tokens. This initial Cleancore DOGE purchase represents a substantial step towards that goal, demonstrating serious commitment from a traditional financial player in the volatile crypto market. Such a large-scale investment by a listed company naturally raises questions about the future of Dogecoin. Why This Cleancore DOGE Purchase Matters for Dogecoin? Institutional investment in cryptocurrencies often acts as a powerful validator, lending credibility to previously speculative assets. Cleancore’s decision to invest heavily in DOGE is particularly noteworthy for several reasons: Enhanced Legitimacy: For years, Dogecoin has been viewed largely as a meme coin. A significant Cleancore DOGE purchase by a NYSE-listed company provides a level of legitimacy and institutional backing that could shift public and investor perception. Market Stability: Large institutional holdings can potentially reduce price volatility. As more tokens are held by long-term investors like Cleancore, the supply available for short-term trading might decrease, possibly contributing to greater price stability. Increased Adoption: Such high-profile investments can inspire other traditional companies to explore cryptocurrency acquisitions, potentially driving broader adoption of digital assets. Moreover, this move highlights a growing trend where established corporations are looking beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, recognizing the potential in other altcoins, even those with unconventional origins like Dogecoin. Consequently, this strategic move by Cleancore could inspire further corporate exploration into diverse digital assets. The Road Ahead: Challenges and Opportunities from Cleancore’s DOGE Purchase While the Cleancore DOGE purchase brings exciting opportunities, it also presents potential challenges. Integrating such a large amount of a volatile asset into a corporate balance sheet requires careful management and a robust understanding of market dynamics. However, the benefits could be substantial. For Dogecoin, this investment could: Spur Development: Increased institutional interest might encourage more development on the Dogecoin blockchain, focusing on utility and functionality beyond its meme status. Attract New Investors: Retail investors often follow institutional trends. Cleancore’s move could attract a new wave of investors who see this as a signal of Dogecoin’s maturity. Influence Price Action: While not guaranteed, significant buying pressure from a major entity could positively influence DOGE’s price trajectory in the long term, provided the company continues its acquisition strategy. However, the crypto market remains inherently unpredictable. Cleancore’s strategy will need to navigate regulatory changes, market sentiment shifts, and the ongoing evolution of the digital asset space. The success of this ambitious plan will be closely watched by the entire industry. What Does This Cleancore DOGE Purchase Mean for Institutional Crypto Investment? The Cleancore DOGE purchase serves as a fascinating case study in the evolving landscape of corporate crypto strategy. It signals a willingness among some traditional companies to embrace assets beyond the established giants like Bitcoin. This bold move by Cleancore Solutions could very well set a precedent, encouraging other firms to diversify their digital asset portfolios and explore less conventional cryptocurrencies. As the lines between traditional finance and decentralized finance continue to blur, such acquisitions demonstrate a clear trend towards mainstream integration. Investors, both retail and institutional, should pay close attention to how these developments unfold, as they could reshape the future of digital asset valuation and adoption. Furthermore, this move highlights a growing confidence in the long-term viability of various digital assets. In conclusion, Cleancore Solutions’ initial $68 million Cleancore DOGE purchase marks a significant milestone for both the company and Dogecoin. It underscores a growing institutional confidence in cryptocurrencies, even those with unique origins. This strategic move could pave the way for increased legitimacy, market stability, and broader adoption for Dogecoin, while also challenging conventional perceptions of value in the digital asset space. The journey to acquire 5% of DOGE’s total supply is just beginning, and its implications will undoubtedly resonate throughout the crypto market for years to come.

This isn’t just any stablecoin; it’s poised to become a cornerstone of the Hyperliquid ecosystem, and some of the biggest names in crypto are vying for the privilege. If you’re invested in the future of decentralized exchanges and stablecoin innovation, this story is for you. Sky’s Ambitious Proposal for Hyperliquid USDH Stablecoin Rune Christensen, the visionary founder of Sky (formerly known as MakerDAO), recently ignited this competition with a bold announcement on X. Sky is officially entering the race to issue the native Hyperliquid USDH stablecoin for the innovative decentralized exchange, Hyperliquid (HYPE). This move signals a significant strategic pivot for Sky and could reshape the future of stablecoin issuance within DeFi. Christensen’s proposal is designed to be highly attractive to the Hyperliquid community. Here’s what Sky is bringing to the table: Generous Yield: A Sky-issued USDH would offer a compelling 4.85% annual yield when deposited on Hyperliquid. This is a significant incentive for users. HYPE Token Buybacks: All proceeds generated from this yield are earmarked for direct buybacks of the HYPE token. This mechanism aims to benefit existing HYPE holders by potentially increasing the token’s value. Substantial Support: Sky plans to back Hyperliquid Genesis Star, a key DeFi project, with a substantial $25 million in USDH. This demonstrates a deep commitment to the Hyperliquid ecosystem. Why is Sky Betting Big on the Hyperliquid USDH Stablecoin? Sky’s decision isn’t just about issuing another stablecoin; it’s a strategic alignment with a rapidly growing DeFi platform. Christensen emphasized that a Sky-issued Hyperliquid USDH stablecoin would inherit the robust security and battle-tested infrastructure of the Sky protocol. This means users would benefit from a stablecoin backed by years of proven resilience and stability in the crypto space, enhancing trust and adoption. Moreover, Sky intends to migrate its own token buyback system to Hyperliquid. This strategic integration is designed to significantly enhance HYPE’s liquidity, creating a deeper and more efficient market for the token. This symbiotic relationship could create a powerful synergy between two major DeFi players, driving mutual growth and innovation. The Fierce Competition: Who Else Wants to Issue USDH? Sky isn’t alone in recognizing the immense potential of the Hyperliquid USDH stablecoin . The competition for issuance rights is fierce, attracting several other prominent contenders. These include established giants and innovative newcomers, each bringing their unique strengths to the table: Paxos: A regulated stablecoin issuer known for its compliance, auditing, and reliability within traditional financial frameworks. Frax Finance: A leading algorithmic stablecoin protocol with a strong presence in DeFi, known for its innovative approach to stablecoin design. Agora: A promising DeFi startup looking to make its mark in the stablecoin landscape, potentially offering a fresh perspective. This diverse lineup underscores the significance of Hyperliquid’s native stablecoin and the perceived value of becoming its issuer. The ultimate decision will likely hinge on factors such as security, yield generation mechanisms, community integration, and overall ecosystem benefits. What Does This Mean for Hyperliquid and the Broader DeFi Ecosystem? The successful issuance of the Hyperliquid USDH stablecoin by any of these contenders will be a game-changer for Hyperliquid. A native, high-yield stablecoin could significantly boost user adoption, increase trading volume, and strengthen the platform’s overall liquidity. This enhanced liquidity is crucial for any decentralized exchange to offer better trading experiences and deeper markets for its users. For the broader DeFi ecosystem, this competition highlights a growing trend: established protocols are actively seeking to integrate and collaborate with innovative platforms to expand their reach and utility. This development also emphasizes the ongoing evolution of stablecoins beyond simple price stability. Protocols are now leveraging stablecoins as tools for: Yield Generation: Offering attractive returns to users, making stablecoins more than just a store of value. Ecosystem Growth: Providing native liquidity and direct support for specific platforms, fostering stronger communities. Strategic Partnerships: Forging alliances between major DeFi players, leading to more integrated and robust financial systems. The battle to issue Hyperliquid’s native Hyperliquid USDH stablecoin is more than just a competition; it’s a testament to the dynamic innovation within decentralized finance. Sky’s compelling offer, combining attractive yields, robust security, and strategic buybacks, positions it as a formidable contender. However, with strong rivals like Paxos, Frax Finance, and Agora also in the running, the outcome remains keenly anticipated. Regardless of who ultimately wins, Hyperliquid and its community stand to gain significantly from this exciting development, promising a more liquid, secure, and rewarding experience. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the Hyperliquid USDH stablecoin? The Hyperliquid USDH stablecoin is the proposed native stablecoin for the decentralized exchange Hyperliquid.

51419674,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=803006,1757378748,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51419674.jpeg,Ex-WhatsApp security chief files suit over privacy failures at Meta,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ex-whatsapp-security-chief-files-suit/,"A former Meta employee has filed a lawsuit accusing the company of allowing “systemic cybersecurity failures” at WhatsApp that put user privacy at risk. The complaint, filed Monday in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, comes from Attaullah Baig, WhatsApp’s former head of security. Baig alleges Meta retaliated against him after he raised concerns, including those directly to CEO Mark Zuckerberg, about serious flaws in the messaging app. Ex-WhatsApp security chief claims Meta ignored privacy risks The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleges that after joining WhatsApp in 2021, Baig uncovered security flaws that breached federal securities laws and Meta’s obligations under a 2020 Federal Trade Commission (FTC) privacy settlement . The case emerges against the backdrop of Meta’s broader legal battles, including its recent request for a U.S. federal judge to dismiss the FTC’s antitrust suit. That case accuses Meta of unlawfully consolidating power in the social media market by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. In its defence, Meta argues the FTC has failed to provide sufficient evidence that the deals were anticompetitive or harmful to consumers. The company contends that Instagram and WhatsApp have thrived under its ownership, benefiting from significant investments, improved security, and enhanced features. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan , Meta also rejects the FTC’s narrow market definition, pointing out that platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Reddit compete directly for users’ attention. In the current case, Baig claimed that in a security test with Meta’s central team, he found that about 1,500 WhatsApp engineers had unrestricted access to sensitive user data and could move or steal it without detection or audit logs. Meta disputed Baig’s allegations in a statement and sought to downplay his position and responsibilities. “Sadly this is a familiar playbook in which a former employee is dismissed for poor performance and then goes public with distorted claims that misrepresent the ongoing hard work of our team,” the spokesperson wrote. “Security is an adversarial space, and we pride ourselves in building on our strong record of protecting people’s privacy.” Whistleblower group Psst.org represents Baig alongside the law firm Schonbrun, Seplow, Harris, Hoffman & Zeldes. While the lawsuit does not allege that user data was directly compromised, it claims Baig repeatedly warned his superiors that WhatsApp’s cybersecurity shortcomings created serious regulatory compliance risks. The issues cited are the platform’s lack of a 24-hour security operations center appropriate for its size, inadequate systems to track employee access to user data, and the absence of a comprehensive inventory of data-storing systems, making proper protection and regulatory disclosure impossible. Baig’s attorneys argue in the lawsuit that his superiors repeatedly criticized his work and that he began receiving “negative performance feedback” just three days after his initial cybersecurity disclosure. Late last year, Baig informed the SEC of the alleged “cybersecurity deficiencies and failure to inform investors about material cybersecurity risks,” the suit says. A month later, Baig sent Zuckerberg the second of two letters, informing the CEO that he “had filed the SEC complaint” and was “requesting immediate action to address both the underlying compliance failures and the unlawful retaliation.” Meta denies allegations, calling the lawsuit a “distorted” attack on its record In January, according to the lawsuit, Baig filed a complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, noting “the systemic retaliation” he alleged he received after the security disclosures. The next month, the complaint says Meta dismissed Baig, citing “poor performance”. This occurred during the company’s February layoffs, which affected 5% of its workforce. The lawsuit argues that the timing and circumstances of Baig’s termination show a clear link to his protected activity. It came soon after his external regulatory filings, capping over two years of alleged systemic retaliation over his cybersecurity disclosures and pushing for compliance with federal law and regulatory orders. Baig’s attorneys said he filed a notice on Monday to move his SEC-related claims to federal court and had already exhausted all administrative remedies before pursuing the case.

Dunamu CEO Oh Kyung-seok recently made a pivotal announcement that could reshape digital finance in the region. On September 9th, Oh revealed that Dunamu, the operator of the major South Korean crypto exchange Upbit, plans to support a won-backed stablecoin through its innovative proprietary Layer 2 chain, Giwa. This development marks a significant step towards integrating digital assets more deeply into the traditional financial system, promising stability and accessibility for users. What Does a Won-Backed Stablecoin Mean for South Korea? For those new to the concept, a stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value. Unlike volatile assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins are typically pegged to a reserve asset, such as fiat currency (like the US dollar or, in this case, the South Korean Won), gold, or other cryptocurrencies. The introduction of a won-backed stablecoin is particularly impactful for South Korea. It offers a digital asset that mirrors the value of the South Korean Won, providing a stable medium for transactions and savings in the crypto space. This stability can reduce risks associated with price fluctuations, making digital payments and remittances more predictable. Moreover, it paves the way for greater regulatory clarity and acceptance within the domestic market, fostering trust among both institutional and retail users. Giwa Chain: The Backbone of South Korea’s New Won-Backed Stablecoin ? At the heart of this initiative is Giwa, Dunamu’s proprietary OP Stack-based Layer 2 chain. CEO Oh Kyung-seok highlighted Giwa’s design as “finance-friendly” during the USDC 2025 event, emphasizing its robust architecture built for stable operations. A Layer 2 solution like Giwa is crucial because it helps scale blockchain networks, offering faster and cheaper transactions compared to Layer 1 blockchains. This technical foundation is essential for supporting a high-volume, stable digital currency. Giwa’s design is not just about speed and cost; it’s also about reliability. The chain’s stability is directly linked to the extensive operational experience Dunamu has gained from running Upbit, one of the largest and most reliable crypto exchanges in South Korea. This deep understanding of market dynamics and user needs positions Giwa as a strong contender to facilitate the stable issuance and distribution of the won-backed stablecoin . The Power of Upbit’s Expertise and KYC Integration for the Won-Backed Stablecoin Dunamu’s decision to leverage its existing infrastructure and expertise from Upbit is a strategic move. Upbit’s long-standing operation in the South Korean market, coupled with its experience in managing staking services, provides a solid bedrock for Giwa. This operational prowess ensures that the stablecoin will be issued and distributed reliably and securely within the country. The expertise gained from managing a high-volume exchange is invaluable for maintaining the integrity and stability of a digital asset like a stablecoin. A critical aspect mentioned by CEO Oh is the potential integration of Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures. If required by regulations, Giwa could seamlessly utilize the existing KYC information of Upbit users. This capability offers several advantages: Streamlined Onboarding: New users would likely experience a smoother onboarding process, as their identities are already verified. Enhanced Security: Leveraging established KYC protocols strengthens the overall security framework, combating illicit activities. Regulatory Compliance: It positions the won-backed stablecoin for easier compliance with financial regulations, a key factor for widespread adoption. What’s Next for the Won-Backed Stablecoin and Giwa? The announcement signals Dunamu’s ambition to be a frontrunner in the evolving digital finance landscape. By providing a stable, regulated, and widely accessible digital currency, they are not only catering to the existing crypto community but also opening doors for broader mainstream adoption. The success of this initiative could set a precedent for other nations considering their own fiat-backed digital currencies. While the exact launch timeline and specific regulatory frameworks are yet to be fully detailed, the vision is clear: to create a secure and efficient digital financial ecosystem in South Korea. The won-backed stablecoin on Giwa chain has the potential to transform how South Koreans interact with digital money, offering a blend of traditional financial stability with blockchain innovation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a won-backed stablecoin? A1: A won-backed stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to the South Korean Won (KRW). This means one stablecoin unit is designed to always be worth one South Korean Won, providing price stability. Q2: What is Giwa chain? A2: Giwa chain is Dunamu’s proprietary Layer 2 blockchain built on the OP Stack. It’s designed to be “finance-friendly” and aims to provide a stable and efficient platform for digital assets, including the new won-backed stablecoin. Q3: How does Upbit’s expertise contribute to this project? A3: Dunamu, the operator of Upbit, leverages its extensive experience in running a major crypto exchange and its staking services to ensure the stable operation of the Giwa chain and the secure issuance and distribution of the stablecoin. Upbit’s existing KYC information could also be utilized for regulatory compliance. Q4: What are the main benefits of a won-backed stablecoin? A4: The main benefits include price stability (reducing volatility risks), potential for faster and cheaper transactions, enhanced regulatory clarity, and greater trust and adoption within the South Korean financial market. Q5: When is the won-backed stablecoin expected to launch? A5: While Dunamu CEO Oh Kyung-seok announced the intention to support a won-backed stablecoin, specific launch timelines and regulatory details are yet to be fully disclosed. The announcement indicates a strategic direction for the future. Q6: Will existing Upbit users automatically have access to the won-backed stablecoin? A6: The announcement mentioned that if KYC procedures are required, Giwa could easily leverage existing Upbit user KYC information. This suggests a potential for streamlined access for Upbit users, but specific access mechanisms will be detailed closer to launch.

The Altcoin Season Index is a crucial barometer, offering insights into whether smaller cryptocurrencies are outshining Bitcoin. Currently, this vital index stands at 52, a figure that has held steady from yesterday, providing a moment for investors to assess the landscape. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index: A Key Metric What exactly is the Altcoin Season Index , and why should you pay attention? Developed by CoinMarketCap, this index offers a clear snapshot of the broader altcoin market’s health relative to Bitcoin. It’s not just a random number; it’s a carefully calculated metric designed to help you understand market cycles. Here’s how it works: The index tracks the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Stablecoins and wrapped coins are excluded to ensure a true representation of market sentiment. An ‘altcoin season’ is officially declared when 75% of these top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day period. A score closer to 100 signals a strong altcoin season, indicating that altcoins are broadly performing better than Bitcoin. Conversely, a lower score suggests Bitcoin dominance. Why the Altcoin Season Index at 52 Matters A reading of 52 for the Altcoin Season Index places us in a neutral zone. It means we are neither in a full-blown altcoin season nor a period of overwhelming Bitcoin dominance. This steady state can be interpreted in several ways: Balanced Market: There’s a relatively even performance between altcoins and Bitcoin, suggesting a period of consolidation or indecision. Opportunity for Selection: While the broader market isn’t showing a strong altcoin trend, individual altcoins may still be performing exceptionally well. This requires careful research and selection. Anticipation: A steady index often precedes a shift. It could be building momentum for an altcoin surge or signaling a potential return to Bitcoin’s lead. For investors, this neutral reading underscores the importance of a diversified and well-researched portfolio. It’s a time to observe and strategize, rather than make hasty decisions based on broad market sentiment. Navigating Market Dynamics with the Altcoin Season Index Understanding the implications of the Altcoin Season Index can significantly influence your investment approach. When the index is high, investors might consider rebalancing their portfolios to capitalize on altcoin growth. Conversely, a low index might prompt a shift towards Bitcoin or stable assets. However, challenges persist in this dynamic market: Volatility: Both Bitcoin and altcoins are known for their price swings, which can quickly change the index’s reading. Information Overload: Sifting through hundreds of altcoins to find the next big performer requires dedication and due diligence. Market Psychology: Fear of missing out (FOMO) can lead to poor investment decisions, especially during perceived altcoin rallies. By using the Altcoin Season Index as a guide, you can make more informed decisions, reducing emotional trading and focusing on data-driven strategies. It’s a tool to complement your research, not replace it. Actionable Insights from the Altcoin Season Index So, what should you do when the Altcoin Season Index is at 52? Here are some actionable insights: Deep Dive into Fundamentals: This is an excellent time to research individual altcoins with strong use cases, solid development teams, and active communities. Monitor Bitcoin Dominance: Keep an eye on Bitcoin’s market capitalization dominance. A decline in BTC dominance often precedes an altcoin rally. Consider Risk Management: In a neutral market, re-evaluate your risk exposure. Diversify across different sectors within crypto, not just different coins. Stay Informed: Market conditions can change rapidly. Regularly check the index and other market indicators to adapt your strategy. The index serves as a reminder that the crypto market is cyclical. Periods of altcoin outperformance often follow periods of Bitcoin strength, and vice-versa. Being prepared for these shifts is key to long-term success. Conclusion: Your Guide to Crypto Market Cycles The current standing of the Altcoin Season Index at 52 offers a valuable perspective on the crypto market. It signals a balanced environment, urging investors to remain vigilant, conduct thorough research, and adapt their strategies to evolving conditions. While not a definitive buy or sell signal, it serves as an excellent compass, helping you navigate the complex world of cryptocurrencies and make more strategic investment choices. Stay informed, stay analytical, and be ready for what comes next. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does an Altcoin Season Index of 52 mean? A1: An index of 52 indicates a neutral market. It means that roughly half of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days, suggesting neither a strong altcoin season nor a period of dominant Bitcoin performance. Q2: How is the Altcoin Season Index calculated? A2: The index is calculated by CoinMarketCap. It compares the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) against Bitcoin over the preceding 90-day period. An altcoin season is declared if 75% of these altcoins outperform Bitcoin. Q3: Should I invest in altcoins when the Altcoin Season Index is at 52? A3: A reading of 52 suggests a balanced market. It’s a good time for careful research into individual altcoins with strong fundamentals, rather than broad market-wide altcoin investments. Diversification and risk management are particularly important. Q4: What typically happens after the Altcoin Season Index holds steady at a neutral level? A4: A steady neutral index can precede a shift in market dominance. It could lead to a renewed altcoin season if conditions become favorable, or a return to Bitcoin dominance. It’s a period of observation and strategic planning for potential future movements. Q5: Does the Altcoin Season Index predict future prices? A5: The Altcoin Season Index is an indicator of past performance and current market sentiment, not a direct predictor of future prices. It helps investors understand market cycles and make informed decisions, but it should be used in conjunction with other research and analysis tools. Enjoyed this insight into the crypto market?

The new lending protocol has been performing wonderfully with its fast and cheap method of collateralized lending, with investors stunned at copious additions in the face of a changing crypto environment. While Ethereum is still the leader in the smart contract market, Mutuum Finance’s innovative low-cost on-chain lending platform and growing ecosystem have investors waiting eagerly for what comes next. Ethereum Still at Substantial Levels As DeFi Highlight Intensifies Ethereum (ETH) $4,308.85 oscillates between intraday lows of $4,269.20 and intraday highs of $4,430.67. The asset continues to have in its favor a smart contract platform with consistent institutional inflow and deep network usage. Analysts continue to say that staying above the $4,300 level is important if it is to keep this current trend going with a potential breakout above $4,500 to hit some more resistance levels sooner or later. Meanwhile, new decentralized finance platforms like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are already drawing even greater attention towards the market. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Stage 6 Ongoing Mutuum Finance is already in presale stage 6 and currently selling the tokens at $0.035, which is 16.17% higher compared to the last stage. The market is heavily interested with more than 16120 invested investors and nearly $15.45 million already raised. In a bid to enhance the platform’s security, there has also been the creation of a USDT Bug Bounty Program with and in partnership with CertiK and worth up to a sum of $50,000 USDT. The bugs fall under categories of critical, major, minor, and low according to the program. Mutuum Finance asset collateralisation caps are essentially risk type inherent in the asset, i.e., supply, borrow, and collateral caps. The protocol is thereby hedging market risk by overcollateralising and also incentivising liquidators to liquidate undercollateralised positions. Borrow caps and deposit caps also cap risk exposure to risky or liquid assets and insolvency risk, respectively. Collateral usage cap on risky tokens can be very low, and the correlated assets will be collateral effective.

Among them is veteran trader and self-described market psychologist Michael XBT, who recently posted a brief but attention-grabbing message on X. He advised followers to “watch XRP this week,” offering no further public details. The statement arrives at a time when XRP is down 9.63% on the monthly chart, fueling speculation that a rebound may be near. Michael’s forecasts carry weight because of his history of accurate calls, which has led many investors to treat his updates with caution but also anticipation. Watch XRP this week. That’s all I’m going to say publicly. My group members know why… — Crypto Michael (@MichaelXBT) September 7, 2025 History of Accurate Predictions Michael XBT has previously delivered bold projections that later proved correct. In mid-2024, when XRP was valued at $0.50, he suggested the token was on the verge of breaking free from a multi-year consolidation pattern. Within months, XRP surged to $3.40 by January 2025, a gain of nearly 600%, validating his analysis. Since that rally, the asset has largely traded above $2, cooling after the rapid climb. Michael has consistently framed this consolidation as a necessary adjustment rather than a sign of weakness. He has also argued that XRP’s next major move would likely coincide with a broader Bitcoin breakout, and his latest comments suggest that alignment could be approaching. Technical and Fundamental Alignment Other market commentators share his optimism. Analyst Davie Satoshi recently highlighted an Elliott Wave formation on XRP’s monthly chart, which indicates that the asset may be entering Wave III, historically the strongest phase of the cycle. Similarly, analyst Dark Defender has argued that XRP has finished its corrective Wave IV and could advance toward $4.50, provided the $2.85 support level holds. At present, XRP trades at $2.97, reflecting a 3.3% daily increase. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 EGRAG, another well-followed analyst, has pointed to XRP’s position above the 21-day exponential moving average as a sign of strength. He outlined short-term price targets near $3.90 and suggested that a much larger move could eventually push the token as high as $46 . Davie Satoshi, meanwhile, projected a potential range of $8 to $30, citing both technical and fundamental factors. Fundamental drivers identified by analysts include Ripple’s acquisition of Rail Financial, the introduction of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, global adoption of the ISO 20022 standard, and exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications involving XRP. These developments are viewed as complementary to the bullish technical outlook. Market Sentiment and Whale Activity Large investors also appear to be positioning for a possible move. Analyst Ripple Van Winkle reported evidence of significant whale accumulation during recent dips below $2.70, which he interprets as a strong support signal. In addition, forecasts generated by artificial intelligence models such as ChatGPT and Grok have shown favorable outlooks for XRP, further reinforcing market confidence. The convergence of technical signals, historical precedent, whale accumulation, and ongoing fundamental developments has heightened expectations for XRP in the near term. While market conditions remain fluid, analysts widely agree that this week could provide key signals for the token’s next direction.

51421055,576492,1757379638,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51421055.jpeg,AI Models Predict Neutral Bitcoin Trend: Warns Of Late-September Shock,https://bitcoinist.com/ai-models-predict-neutral-bitcoin-trend-september/,"Bitcoin is currently in a consolidation phase after a strong multi-month uptrend that began in April. Following weeks of heightened volatility and selling pressure, BTC has managed to hold steady above critical support levels, keeping the broader bullish narrative alive. Some analysts argue that this resilience highlights the strength of Bitcoin’s current market structure and even suggest that a push beyond all-time highs could be on the horizon in the coming weeks. Despite uncertainty and cautious sentiment, long-term holders and institutional flows continue to provide a foundation for Bitcoin’s price stability. While short-term corrections remain possible, the broader market remains optimistic that BTC is preparing for another leg higher. CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Onchain recently shared a Bitcoin TFT AI Forecast, which points to BTC trading in a mostly neutral range for the next month. According to the model, Bitcoin is likely to stay around current levels without a sharp breakout or collapse in the near term. This reinforces the idea that the market is digesting its recent gains before attempting another move. Bitcoin AI Forecast Suggests Rising Uncertainty According to the Temporal Fusion Transformer ( TFT ) AI Forecast, Bitcoin is expected to trade within a mostly neutral range in the coming weeks, though uncertainty is rising sharply. The model places Bitcoin’s current price at $110,669, projecting a 1.1% decline to $109,451 over the next seven days. Looking further ahead, the 30-day forecast anticipates a 1.72% decrease to $108,771, reinforcing the idea of consolidation rather than a clear bullish or bearish breakout. The most important signal, however, is not the modest downside forecast, but the sharp opening of confidence intervals. Model uncertainty climbs above 50% by the end of the forecast period, signaling elevated risk and the potential for severe volatility. This uncertainty opens the door to multiple scenarios. The main scenario, combining both the WaveNet and TFT models, suggests Bitcoin will hold within the $108,000–$120,000 channel, a range-bound movement likely to dominate the first three weeks of September. A surprise scenario, however, could emerge in the final week. If a strong catalyst or sudden sentiment shift occurs, the elevated uncertainty could translate into an explosive move—either a breakout to fresh highs or a sharp retrace. While the market faces slight selling pressure short term, the last week of September may prove decisive, with volatility set to define Bitcoin’s next big move. Testing Support Within Ongoing Consolidation The 3-day Bitcoin chart shows BTC trading at $112,146, rebounding 1.77% after recent volatility. The price remains in a consolidation phase following the rejection from the all-time high near $124,500. Notably, Bitcoin has so far defended the $110,000 support zone, which has acted as a floor during recent pullbacks. The moving averages highlight the structure: the 50-day SMA at $107,765 and the 100-day SMA at $100,647 provide strong medium-term support. Meanwhile, the 200-day SMA at $81,576 remains far below, reflecting Bitcoin’s broader bullish cycle despite short-term weakness. Holding above the 50-day average is key for confirming the resilience of this uptrend. Immediate resistance lies at $115,000, a level Bitcoin failed to reclaim in its last attempts. A successful breakout above this region could open the path toward $120,000–123,000, where the ATH sits. Conversely, failure to maintain $110,000 could trigger further downside, potentially targeting the $107,000–105,000 range.

Cardano Is Breaking Out Of A Falling Wedge Pattern In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a technical analysis (TA) pattern forming in the 4-hour price of Cardano. The pattern in question is a “Falling Wedge,” which belongs to the broader class of Wedges. Related Reading: Old Bitcoin Supply Keeps Moving Into ETFs: Data Shows Three Waves So far Wedges form whenever an asset travels between two converging trendlines. When the lines are sloped upward, the formation is known as a Rising Wedge. Similarly, price action to the downside creates a Falling Wedge. Wedges sound similar to Triangles, which also involve converging trendlines, but the key difference between the two is that Triangles are consolidation patterns, while Wedges involve some net movement up or down. Just like with Triangles, though, the trendlines of the channel act as support/resistance barriers for the price. Also, a breakout of either of these bounds can imply a continuation of the trend in that direction. Generally, Wedges are considered more likely to lead to reversals. A Falling Wedge may see the price eventually break past the upper line, while a Rising Wedge could end with a breakdown of support. Cardano has recently been moving inside a channel similar to a Falling Wedge. Below is the chart shared by Martinez, showcasing the formation. At the time the analyst posted the graph, Cardano was beginning to show signs of a surge beyond the resistance line of this Falling Wedge. The breakout attempt came as the asset was closing in on the convergence point of the trendlines. Near the apex of such patterns, price action occurs inside a tight range, so breakouts can become more likely. This could be what was developing for ADA at the time. Martinez noted in the post that the cryptocurrency must break past $0.84 to confirm the bullish breakout. Since then, ADA has surged further, reaching the $0.85 level. Thus, it’s possible that a sustainable break could really be kicking off for the coin, at least if the Falling Wedge is anything to go by. Related Reading: Safe Haven Split: Bitcoin-Gold Correlation Turns Negative For First Time In 6 Months While Cardano is witnessing this Falling Wedge, fellow altcoin Solana has been traveling inside a Rising Wedge instead, as pointed out by the analyst in an earlier X post. As displayed in the chart, Solana has been trading inside this Rising Wedge for a few months now and is slowly inching toward the end of it. If the pattern is going to be a reversal one, then a bearish breakout may be coming for SOL. ADA Price At the time of writing, Cardano is floating around $0.851, up almost 4% over the last seven days.

ADA is trying to push higher toward $1.20 and beyond, while HBAR is holding near $0.24 with mixed signals. Some analysts expect a rally toward $0.30, while others warn of a slide back to $0.16. While both projects remain active, the center of attention has tilted toward BlockDAG . Its presale is generating headlines with whales flipping the leaderboard and millions of dollars flowing in. Batch 30 sits at $0.0013, and the project has already raised nearly $400 million while selling 25.9 billion coins. Many are now asking the same question: is BlockDAG the best crypto to buy now before listings? BlockDAG’s Whale Wars Heat Up BlockDAG’s presale has become a spectacle of competition, where whales are battling for dominance. Recent entries of $4.4M and $4.3M have overtaken earlier leaders, pushing previous $3.8M buys further down the ranks. Every leaderboard shift creates a rush among retail buyers, who don’t want to be left behind. At Batch 30’s $0.0013 price, the numbers are stacking up fast. More than nearly $400 million has already been raised, with 25.9 billion BDAG coins sold. For early participants who entered at $0.001. Momentum is set to rise further with the BDAG Deployment Event, partnered with Coinstore, in Singapore. This milestone will focus on strengthening BlockDAG’s technology, expanding its community presence, and signaling readiness for adoption on a global scale. It’s a step that combines exposure with tangible achievements, reinforcing long-term confidence. Beyond speculation, adoption numbers are impressive. More than 3 million users are already mining BDAG through the X1 mobile app, while hardware sales have crossed 19,594 miners, generating $7.8M in revenue. The ecosystem is also expanding with 300+ dApps and 4,500 developers contributing. With confirmed listings on MEXC, BitMart, and LBank, plus talks underway with Coinbase and Gemini, liquidity is essentially guaranteed. This combination of whale battles, retail FOMO, and ecosystem progress explains why BlockDAG is gaining recognition as the best crypto to buy now. Cardano (ADA) Price Target Updates Cardano continues to attract attention with technical setups pointing toward fresh gains. The short-term Cardano (ADA) price target sits around $0.8050, with bullish momentum building after ADA broke resistance at $0.91. Analysts are highlighting potential moves toward $1.20–$1.90 if momentum holds, supported by whale accumulation of nearly 200 million ADA. Added speculation about ETF products tied to ADA has lifted optimism further. For the long term, forecasts diverge. Some technical models, including Gann Square projections, suggest possible targets between $6 and $11 if the market enters a strong bullish cycle. More moderate outlooks expect a climb into the $1.20–$1.50 zone by the end of the year. For 2025, broader Cardano (ADA) price targets cluster between $2 and $4.83, depending on adoption growth in DeFi and NFTs. With ADA trading near $0.84, the setup is attractive but risky. If resistance levels fail, bearish retracements could drag it back to the $0.19–$0.20 support zone. That uncertainty is why some traders are diversifying into projects with clearer near-term upside, such as BlockDAG’s presale. Hedera (HBAR) Price Trend Outlook Hedera is trading near $0.24, consolidating after a series of pullbacks. The Hedera (HBAR) price trend is one of the most debated in the market today. Technical charts show a head-and-shoulders pattern that could lead to a 30% drop, sending HBAR toward $0.16. Other bearish scenarios suggest a softer retracement toward $0.19. Indicators like RSI and MACD are also flashing caution, hinting at continued selling pressure. Still, not all signals are negative. On the bullish side, chart watchers see a flag pattern that could take HBAR back toward $0.30 if momentum picks up. Recoveries from support zones have kept some optimism alive, particularly with institutional developments like SWIFT trials and new investment vehicles. For traders, the pivot remains $0.24. A sustained break above this level opens the door to a move higher, while a failure risks deeper corrections. The split outlook makes HBAR an uncertain choice compared to the clearer momentum seen in BlockDAG. Why BlockDAG Is the Best Crypto to Buy Now Cardano is building confidence with bullish price targets, while Hedera is balancing between bearish risks and possible recoveries. Both projects have potential, but neither is matching the scale of BlockDAG’s presale. With nearly $400M raised, 25.9B coins sold, BlockDAG has turned its presale into one of the biggest stories in crypto. Whale buys worth $4.4M and $4.3M have reset the leaderboard, while millions of retail buyers follow the action closely. At $0.0013 in Batch 30, the presale still offers upside before the confirmed $0.05 listing price. The ecosystem adds further weight to the case. Millions mining on the X1 app, nearly 20K hardware miners shipped, and a deep developer pipeline prove the project isn’t only about presale hype. Exchange listings on major platforms are locked in and ensure massive exposure to global audiences. For those deciding what crypto to buy now, BlockDAG is standing out as the clearest opportunity. It combines momentum, adoption, liquidity plans, and bonus-driven upside in a way ADA and HBAR currently can’t match.

A significant development has emerged from the U.S. House of Representatives with the introduction of a new bill, HR 5166. This legislation aims to formally address how the federal government will store and manage its strategic Bitcoin reserves , signaling a pivotal shift in how digital assets are perceived at a national level. Why are Strategic Bitcoin Reserves Important? This bill, if it passes, represents more than just a procedural step. It is a clear indication that the U.S. government is seriously considering Bitcoin reserves and other digital assets as vital components of its national strategic assets. Such a move could have profound implications for economic stability, national security, and the future of financial policy. Diversification: Holding digital assets like Bitcoin could offer a new form of reserve diversification, moving beyond traditional gold and foreign currency holdings. Economic Leadership: By developing a clear strategy, the U.S. could position itself as a leader in the digital asset space, influencing global standards and practices. Future-Proofing: As the global economy increasingly digitizes, having a robust framework for managing digital assets prepares the nation for future financial landscapes. The very act of introducing such a bill underscores the growing recognition of Bitcoin’s permanence and potential utility beyond speculative trading. What Does HR 5166 Mandate for Bitcoin Reserves? The core of HR 5166 is straightforward: it mandates a concrete plan. Specifically, the bill requires the Secretary of the Treasury to develop and report a comprehensive digital asset custody plan. This plan must be presented to relevant House and Senate committees within 90 days of the bill becoming law. This timeline highlights the urgency and importance attached to establishing clear guidelines for the management of potential Bitcoin reserves . The report is expected to detail: Secure storage solutions for digital assets. Protocols for managing access and transactions. Risk mitigation strategies against volatility and cyber threats. Regulatory frameworks necessary for oversight. Essentially, the bill pushes for a proactive approach to integrating digital assets into national financial strategy, rather than a reactive one. Navigating the Challenges of Managing Digital Assets While the benefits of strategic Bitcoin reserves are compelling, the challenges are equally significant. Managing such reserves involves navigating complex issues that are unique to digital assets. These include: Security: Protecting large holdings of Bitcoin from cyberattacks, hacks, and unauthorized access requires state-of-the-art security infrastructure and protocols. Volatility: Bitcoin’s price fluctuations can be substantial, necessitating sophisticated risk management strategies to safeguard the value of national holdings. Regulatory Clarity: The digital asset space is still evolving, and clear regulatory guidelines are essential for responsible management and to prevent market manipulation. The Treasury’s plan will undoubtedly need to address these hurdles comprehensively, ensuring that any move towards stockpiling digital assets is both secure and fiscally sound. What’s Next for the Strategic Bitcoin Reserves Bill? The journey for HR 5166 is still underway. Having been introduced, the bill has now been referred to the full House for consideration. This means it will undergo further debate, potential amendments, and eventually a vote. If it passes the House, it would then move to the Senate for their review and approval before potentially being signed into law by the President. This legislative process is crucial, as it allows for thorough scrutiny and ensures that all aspects of managing strategic Bitcoin reserves are carefully evaluated. The outcome will set a precedent for how governments worldwide might approach digital assets in the future. A Bold Step Towards Digital Asset Integration In conclusion, the introduction of HR 5166 marks a bold and crucial step for the United States in formally acknowledging and planning for the management of strategic Bitcoin reserves . It signals a maturation of the digital asset space and its increasing relevance to national policy. While challenges remain, the mandate for a comprehensive plan demonstrates a commitment to understanding and harnessing the potential of cryptocurrencies as national assets. This legislation could pave the way for a more integrated and forward-thinking approach to finance in the digital age, leaving a lasting impression on how nations view and manage their wealth. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is HR 5166? HR 5166 is a bill introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives that mandates the Secretary of the Treasury to draft a plan for managing the federal government’s strategic Bitcoin reserves and other digital assets. Why would the U.S. government hold Bitcoin reserves? The U.S. government might hold Bitcoin reserves for several reasons, including diversifying national assets, establishing leadership in the digital economy, and preparing for future financial landscapes where digital assets play a significant role. Who is responsible for drafting this digital asset custody plan? The Secretary of the Treasury is responsible for drafting the digital asset custody plan and reporting it to relevant House and Senate committees within 90 days of the bill’s passage. What are the main challenges in managing strategic Bitcoin reserves? Key challenges include ensuring robust security against cyber threats, managing the inherent volatility of Bitcoin, and establishing clear regulatory frameworks for oversight and responsible management. What are the next steps for HR 5166? After its introduction, HR 5166 has been referred to the full House for consideration. It will undergo debate, potential amendments, and a vote before potentially moving to the Senate for further review and approval.

His goal was to entice them with promises of lucrative, high-return cryptocurrency investments, only to siphon off their hard-earned funds for himself. Victim Deception: The perpetrator skillfully built a façade of legitimacy, convincing numerous victims to transfer their money into what they believed were legitimate investment vehicles. Rapid Digital Conversion: Once acquired, the illicit funds were swiftly converted into USDT (Tether), a popular stablecoin. This conversion was a key step in the crypto laundering process, designed to obscure the money’s origins and make it significantly harder for authorities to trace. Massive Scale of Fraud: The operation successfully laundered an astonishing $37 million. This substantial figure underscores the significant financial impact and the broad reach of such sophisticated digital asset frauds. This detailed account provides a chilling look into the methods employed by criminals in the digital age, emphasizing the constant need for user vigilance. Why is Crypto Laundering a Growing Global Concern? The incident underscores a critical and evolving issue in the global digital economy: the persistent misuse of cryptocurrencies for illegal activities. While the underlying blockchain technology offers unprecedented transparency and immutability, bad actors relentlessly seek innovative ways to obscure their tracks and exploit perceived loopholes. The inherent characteristics of cryptocurrencies—such as the ease of cross-border transactions, the speed of transfers, and the potential for pseudo-anonymity—can unfortunately make them attractive tools for money launderers and other criminals. However, it is crucial to recognize that law enforcement agencies and financial intelligence units worldwide are becoming increasingly sophisticated in their methods for tracking, investigating, and prosecuting these complex digital crimes. This particular sentencing serves as a powerful and unambiguous deterrent, unequivocally demonstrating that illicit financial activities, even those conducted entirely within the digital asset space, will not go unpunished. The global effort to combat crypto laundering is intensifying, with significant resources being dedicated to tracing illicit flows. What Are the Far-Reaching Ramifications of Such Crypto Laundering Cases? The 51-month prison sentence handed down to the California man sends a clear, resounding message about the legal system’s unwavering commitment to combating financial crime in the digital realm. Such high-profile convictions have several profound and far-reaching ramifications, impacting victims, regulators, and the broader cryptocurrency industry: Justice for Victims: While full financial recovery is not always guaranteed, these legal actions are vital for providing a measure of justice and closure for those who suffered significant financial losses. They also deter future criminal activity. Enhanced Regulatory Scrutiny: Cases like this invariably spur further discussions, reviews, and the development of more robust cryptocurrency regulations. The aim is to create a safer, more compliant, and more trustworthy environment for all legitimate users and innovators within the digital asset space. Building Industry Trust: By actively identifying, apprehending, and prosecuting bad actors involved in crypto laundering , the cryptocurrency industry can gradually build greater trust with the public, traditional financial institutions, and governments. This is absolutely crucial for achieving wider mainstream adoption and fostering responsible innovation. This case emphatically highlights the critical importance of conducting thorough due diligence for anyone considering engaging with cryptocurrency platforms or individuals offering investment opportunities. Always verify legitimacy, research extensively, and remain highly skeptical of promises that seem too good to be true. Protecting yourself in this dynamic landscape is paramount. Protecting Yourself: Actionable Insights Against Crypto Laundering Scams To navigate the crypto world safely and avoid falling victim to similar scams or inadvertently participating in illicit activities, consider these actionable insights: Research Thoroughly: Before investing in any crypto project or platform, conduct extensive research. Check reviews, team backgrounds, and project whitepapers. Be Skeptical of High Returns: If an investment promises unusually high, guaranteed returns with little to no risk, it’s almost certainly a scam. Verify Identity: Always verify the identity of individuals offering investment advice or soliciting funds. Be cautious of unsolicited messages or calls. Use Reputable Exchanges: Stick to well-known, regulated cryptocurrency exchanges that have strong security protocols and comply with AML (Anti-Money Laundering) and KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements. Secure Your Wallets: Use strong, unique passwords, enable two-factor authentication (2FA), and consider hardware wallets for significant holdings. Report Suspicious Activity: If you encounter suspicious activity or believe you’ve been targeted by a scam, report it to the relevant authorities immediately. In conclusion, the sentencing of the California man for his central role in a $37 million crypto laundering scheme is a landmark event, signaling a new era of accountability in the digital asset space. It powerfully illustrates the unwavering commitment of federal prosecutors and global law enforcement to combating financial crime within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This case serves as a vital reminder for both potential criminals and everyday users: the digital world is not a lawless frontier. Vigilance, robust security practices, and strict adherence to legal and ethical frameworks are absolutely paramount for fostering a secure, trustworthy, and ultimately prosperous digital future. The ongoing fight against crypto laundering is intensifying, but justice is increasingly catching up with those who seek to exploit the system for illicit gain. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is crypto laundering? Crypto laundering refers to the process of concealing the origins of illegally obtained funds by converting them into cryptocurrencies, then moving them through various digital wallets and exchanges to make them appear legitimate. Q2: How was the California man able to launder $37 million? He gained victims’ trust through messages and phone calls, posing as an investment opportunity. Once funds were received, he converted them into USDT to obscure their source, effectively laundering the money. Q3: What is USDT and why is it used in crypto laundering? USDT (Tether) is a stablecoin, meaning its value is pegged to the U.S. dollar. It’s often used in illicit activities because it offers liquidity and can be moved quickly across borders, making it a convenient tool for criminals to convert and transfer large sums while attempting to evade detection. Q4: What are the penalties for crypto laundering? Penalties for crypto laundering can be severe, including lengthy prison sentences, substantial fines, and forfeiture of assets. The specific punishment depends on the amount laundered, the jurisdiction, and the specifics of the crime, as evidenced by the 51-month sentence in this case. Q5: How can individuals protect themselves from crypto investment scams? Always conduct thorough research on any investment opportunity, be wary of promises of guaranteed high returns, verify the identity of those soliciting funds, use reputable and regulated exchanges, and enable strong security measures like two-factor authentication on your accounts. If it seems too good to be true, it likely is. This case serves as a critical reminder of the ongoing fight against digital financial crime.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Crypto traders remain cautious ahead of Thursday’s U.S. CPI report, with BTC trading flat above $111,600, and ETH at $4,298. The CD20 , a measure of the performance of the largest digital assets, is trading above 4,000, up 1.6%. The August Nonfarm Payrolls miss , just 22,000 jobs added versus expectations of 75,000, pushed futures higher and dragged 2-year Treasury yields to year-lows as markets priced in 72 bps of cuts this year. Yet crypto remains rangebound, diverging from broader risk sentiment. Options markets confirm the defensive stance. QCP Capital noted in its recent Asia Market Update that risk reversals are increasingly skewed toward puts, with short-dated implied vols elevated into CPI. Polymarket data backs this positioning: ETH carries a 70% chance of staying above $4,600 this month but only 13% odds of breaking $5,600. Traders are bracing for turbulence, not chasing upside. SOL is the outlier , with odds of a new all-time high before 2026 rising sharply, signaling improving breadth beneath the surface. In a note to CoinDesk, market maker Enflux argues that the SEC’s forward-looking rules for token sales and listings, combined with the steady march of institutions like Coinbase into major indices, show how deeply crypto is embedding into the system. This is the “split-screen reality” of 2025: speculation dominates headlines, while adoption rails are being laid in the background. The legitimacy narrative also played out in real time on Friday. Michael Saylor’s Strategy was left out of the S&P 500 despite meeting all criteria, while Robinhood was unexpectedly included instead, sending its stock up 7% and underscoring that crypto-adjacent firms with diversified business lines may reach blue-chip status faster than pure treasury plays. WLFI’s turmoil illustrates the speculative side of the split-screen. The protocol froze over 270 wallets, including Justin Sun’s, to “protect users” after phishing-related compromises. ""On one side, speculative narratives like WLFI risk cannibalizing themselves through governance drama,"" Enflux wrote in its note. ""On the other hand, institutional-grade infrastructure and regulation are solidifying at a pace that suggests the rails for mainstream adoption are being laid faster than most expect."" Onchain data shows Sun’s transfers came hours after WLFI’s crash , which was instead driven by shorting and dumping across exchanges. Yet the freeze rattled whales and market makers – shocked that the free market of crypto could be broken by protocol governance fiat – with insiders asking: “If they can do it to Sun, who’s next?”. The takeaway: near-term volatility and governance drama may cap upside, but the deeper story is that crypto’s institutional and regulatory foundations are hardening. ""Structural legitimacy, not speculation, remains the real story of 2025,"" Enflux continued. For traders, that means bracing for CPI noise; for investors, it means the legitimacy story continues to build. Market Movement: BTC: Bitcoin is holding steady above $111K, with support from consolidation near key resistance levels and solid on‑chain support zones. Analysts suggest this stability could pave the way for a breakout, though some caution about a possible pullback toward $100K exists ETH: Ethereum’s price has eased slightly intraday, trading around $4.3K. This movement may reflect broader crypto market dynamics, including relatively subdued demand and positioning around current technical levels. Gold: Gold has surged to fresh record highs, recently hitting ~$3,636/oz, as expectations of U.S. interest rate cuts rise amid weak labor data, a soft U.S. dollar, geopolitical concerns, and continued central bank demand. Nikkei 225: Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.9% to a record high and the Topix gained 0.52% as investors bet a new LDP leader could deliver fresh fiscal stimulus following Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’s resignation. S&P 500: U.S. stocks edged higher Monday, with the S&P 500 up 0.2%, as investors awaited inflation data to gauge the likelihood of a jumbo Fed rate cut next week.

Arthur Hayes, the visionary co-founder of BitMEX, has just made a substantial ENA purchase , injecting over $1 million into the Ethena ecosystem. This isn’t just another transaction; it’s a statement that has caught the attention of investors and analysts alike. Understanding the Astounding ENA Purchase Details surrounding this major acquisition highlight its strategic nature. Reports from EmberCN confirm that Hayes acquired a staggering 1.395 million ENA tokens. This equates to approximately $1.01 million at the time of purchase. He executed this impressive ENA purchase through two prominent platforms: Binance and Flowdesk. The average price per token stood at a notable $0.73. Such a large-scale investment from a figure of Hayes’ stature often signals confidence in a project’s future. It prompts a closer look at the Ethena protocol and the potential trajectory of its native token, ENA. Who is Arthur Hayes and Why Does His ENA Purchase Matter? Arthur Hayes is not just any investor; he is a highly influential voice in the crypto space. As the co-founder and former CEO of BitMEX, one of the earliest and largest cryptocurrency derivatives exchanges, his insights and actions carry significant weight. His market commentary and investment decisions are closely watched by a global audience. Therefore, his recent ENA purchase is more than just a personal investment; it’s often interpreted as a bullish signal for the asset. Market Influence: Hayes’ public endorsements or investments can sway market sentiment. Strategic Acumen: Known for his deep understanding of market mechanics and macroeconomics. Early Adopter: Often identifies promising projects before they reach mainstream attention. What is the Ethena Protocol and Its ENA Token? To fully grasp the significance of Hayes’ investment, it’s essential to understand Ethena. The Ethena protocol is an innovative synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum. It aims to provide a censorship-resistant, scalable, and stable cryptocurrency solution. Its core offering is USDe, a synthetic dollar that maintains its peg through delta hedging staked Ethereum and Bitcoin. The ENA token, on the other hand, is the native governance token of the Ethena protocol. Holders of ENA can participate in the decentralized governance of the protocol. This includes voting on key decisions that shape its future development and operational parameters. A major ENA purchase by an influential figure like Hayes naturally brings more eyes to the protocol’s underlying technology and vision. Potential Implications of This Major ENA Purchase Hayes’ substantial investment could have several ripple effects across the crypto market, particularly for ENA. Firstly, it could generate increased interest and demand for the token. This heightened visibility might attract new investors who see his move as a vote of confidence. Secondly, it validates Ethena’s model in the eyes of many. An expert like Hayes putting significant capital into the project suggests he sees genuine value and potential for growth. However, it is crucial to remember that while influential endorsements can be positive, market dynamics are complex. Investors should always conduct their own research before making investment decisions. This ENA purchase serves as a strong indicator, but it doesn’t guarantee future performance. Arthur Hayes’ $1 million ENA purchase is undoubtedly a pivotal moment for the Ethena protocol and its community. It underscores the growing interest in innovative synthetic dollar solutions and the power of influential figures in the crypto landscape. As the market continues to evolve, keeping an eye on such strategic investments can offer valuable insights into emerging trends and potential future leaders in the decentralized finance space.

On September 10, lawmakers are set to confirm Fed nominee Stephen Miran , a decision that could send significant ripples through the economy. For those tracking the cryptocurrency markets, understanding the Federal Reserve’s composition and leadership is absolutely crucial. A new voice on the Fed’s board can influence monetary policy, which in turn impacts everything from interest rates to investor sentiment, and ultimately, the value of digital assets. Who is Fed Nominee Stephen Miran , and Why Does This Appointment Matter? Stephen Miran, currently serving as the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), has been tapped by President Trump to fill a key vacancy on the Federal Reserve’s board. His nomination is more than just a procedural step; it represents a potential shift in the nuanced balance of economic perspectives within the Fed. The Federal Reserve plays an unparalleled role in shaping the nation’s economic landscape. Its decisions on interest rates, inflation targets, and quantitative easing directly affect credit availability, consumer spending, and investment flows. Therefore, the individuals who sit on its board wield immense power. What Role Does a Fed Nominee Play in Monetary Policy? Each governor on the Federal Reserve Board contributes to the formulation of monetary policy. They participate in the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings, where critical decisions about interest rates and the money supply are made. These decisions are the bedrock of economic stability and growth. A new governor, like Fed nominee Stephen Miran , brings their own economic philosophy and insights to these discussions. Their views can influence the collective direction of the Fed, potentially leading to adjustments in how the central bank approaches inflation, employment, and financial stability. This ripple effect is felt across all asset classes, including the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. The Senate’s Role: Confirming Fed Nominee Stephen Miran The U.S. Senate’s confirmation process is a critical check and balance. Senators scrutinize a nominee’s background, qualifications, and economic views through hearings and debates. This ensures that only qualified individuals are entrusted with such significant responsibilities. The vote on September 10 will determine if Miran joins the ranks of the Fed governors. A successful confirmation would immediately add his perspective to the central bank’s deliberations. Conversely, a rejection would necessitate a new nomination, potentially delaying crucial policy discussions. Potential Economic Ripple Effects and Crypto Implications of Fed Nominee Stephen Miran What could Miran’s confirmation mean for the broader economy and, specifically, for digital assets? Here are some key considerations: Monetary Policy Direction: Depending on Miran’s specific economic leanings, his presence could subtly shift the Fed’s stance on inflation or interest rates. A more hawkish approach (favoring higher rates to combat inflation) might strengthen the dollar but could put downward pressure on risk assets like crypto. Inflation Outlook: If Miran’s views align with a more aggressive approach to managing inflation, this could influence market expectations. Lower inflation expectations might reduce the appeal of assets like Bitcoin as an inflation hedge. Investor Sentiment: Clarity and stability in central bank leadership often reassure markets. The successful confirmation of Fed nominee Stephen Miran could provide this, potentially fostering a more predictable environment for investors, which generally benefits all markets. It’s important to remember that the Fed operates as a committee. While individual governors are influential, decisions are made collectively. However, each new voice contributes to the overall consensus. The upcoming Senate vote on Fed nominee Stephen Miran is a significant event on the financial calendar. His potential addition to the Federal Reserve Board carries implications that extend far beyond Washington D.C., reaching into the daily lives of consumers and the volatile world of digital finance. Staying informed about such appointments is essential for anyone seeking to understand the underlying currents shaping our economic future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Federal Reserve’s primary role? The Federal Reserve, often called the Fed, is the central bank of the United States. Its primary roles include conducting the nation’s monetary policy, supervising and regulating banking institutions, maintaining the stability of the financial system, and providing financial services to depository institutions. Why is a Fed governor’s appointment important for the economy? A Fed governor’s appointment is crucial because they participate in setting monetary policy, including decisions on interest rates and the money supply. These decisions directly impact economic growth, inflation, employment, and the overall stability of financial markets. How might a new Fed governor impact cryptocurrency markets? A new Fed governor can indirectly impact cryptocurrency markets by influencing broader monetary policy. For example, changes in interest rate policy or the Fed’s stance on inflation can affect the attractiveness of risk assets like cryptocurrencies compared to traditional investments. What is the White House Council of Economic Advisers (CEA)? The White House Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) is a group of three leading economists who advise the President of the United States on economic policy. They conduct objective economic research and analysis to help shape the administration’s economic agenda. What happens if the Senate rejects a Fed nominee? If the Senate rejects a Fed nominee, the position remains vacant. The President would then need to nominate a different candidate to fill the role, restarting the confirmation process. This can lead to delays in having a full complement of governors on the Federal Reserve Board. Did this article help you understand the significance of the upcoming Fed nominee Stephen Miran vote?

This development comes as Microsoft beat Wall Street expectations, posting quarterly earnings of $3.65 per share and revenue of $76.44 billion, above the projected $73.89 billion. Its Intelligent Cloud unit brought in $29.88 billion, also surpassing forecasts. Because Microsoft’s fiscal year ends in June, this quarter closed out its FY2025 rather than the calendar year’s second quarter. Nebius powers Microsoft’s AI growth Nebius will also grant Microsoft access to dedicated GPU clusters via a future data center it is building in Vineland, New Jersey. The t iming of the deal is key. As companies race to develop and deploy generative AI, the demand for computing power has soared. Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI requires huge infrastructure for training ever-bigger models and delivering AI services to its customers over Azure. GPU global supply chains are still in short supply. Nvidia, the leading maker of chips used in AI, can’t make things fast enough. This shortfall has led big technology companies to seek alternative solutions for guaranteed capacity. This deal also ensures Microsoft gets a secure source of GPUs that don’t have to come through traditional channels. It also means hardware bottlenecks won’t set back its AI research teams and enterprise customers. To some extent, the agreement is also about strategic diversification, the experts said. Microsoft is mitigating the risks by not putting all of its trust in just Nvidia and a handful of hardware manufacturing partners. This reduces risk and increases resilience in its infrastructure planning. Analysts said the move would provide a big lift to Microsoft in its battle with others in the race for so-called artificial intelligence supremacy. Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud also pour billions into AI data centers and custom chips. Now that they have added this GPU capacity, they can continue to differentiate themselves in the race to provide reliable and scalable AI services on the industry’s best infrastructure. Finally, the collaboration sets Microsoft up to grow its Azure global AI footprint, while offering Nebius an opportunity to demonstrate its infrastructure at scale. Deal fuels Nebius’s future Nebius, on the other hand, sees the deal as transformative. The Amsterdam company, spun out of the Russian tech company Yandex in 2024, is rapidly emerging as a player in the world of global AI infrastructure. Nebius CEO Arkady Volozh said the agreement demonstrated the company’s ability to compete with established giants. It was the first of several long-term deals planned with leading technology firms. Nebius intends to fund the new infrastructure underneath the deal through a combination of cash flow from the Microsoft deal and debt backed by the contract. The firm is also considering other sources of funding to fuel growth. Nebius stock soared more than 60% in early trading on the news. Investors greeted the deal as indicating strong interest in Nebius’s AI cloud services. The contract also ensures Nebius of a steady revenue stream for years. That stability will let it grow its global footprint, invest in more data centers, and strengthen its cloud play for AI. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

This action addresses the recent rising concerns about regulations in the digital assets ecosystem and suggests suitable updates to the commission’s rules. Notably, this public roundtable on financial surveillance and privacy marks the sixth roundtable to be held addressing rising issues in the digital assets sector since Gary Gensler, a former chairman of the US SEC, withdrew from his position. According to an SEC notice released on September 8, the roundtable is scheduled for October 17. In a statement, Peirce mentioned, “Learning about new developments in tools that protect privacy will help the SEC and other financial regulators as we work on policy solutions in the crypto area.” The US SEC proposes amendments to its crypto rules Roundtables focusing on the crypto ecosystem are part of a series of 10 meetings that are taking place from August through December across the US. This event comes when the US SEC considers proposed amendments to its crypto rules , which could significantly impact market players. On Thursday, 4 September, the commission made public its suggestion to implement certain exemptions and safe harbors in the provision and sale of crypto assets and its intentions to enhance broker-dealer financial responsibility rules. According to them, these measures will ease requirements for crypto firms operating in the US. Since January, this action of loosening regulations and enforcement measures has been popular among the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the main financial regulators in the US. This has affected crypto firms as the commissions have withdrawn several investigations and lawsuits. During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump emphasized that his administration would adopt a friendlier stance toward cryptocurrency, signaling reduced hostility from the highest levels of government—a position he has largely maintained. Under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, known for his strict regulatory approach, the crypto community often felt constrained. His departure sparked significant anticipation, and while Gensler is now out of the picture, the SEC remains active and appears poised for a busy and evolving regulatory future. A new proposed law sparks hope for a new turn in the US financial regulators’ policies The two regulators, the SEC and the CFTC, have vowed to work together to monitor and provide support to spot crypto trading. Additionally, they have reportedly stated that they would look into having capital markets operating 24/7 and establishing regulations, particularly for crypto derivatives. Their decision aligns with a suggestion from President Donald Trump in July’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets. Moreover, it is worth noting that the CFTC is currently under the leadership of only Acting Chair Caroline Pham, who, earlier in August, stated that the commission would strictly adhere to the White House’s direction put in place on crypto policy. Despite the SEC and CFTC’s decisions aligning with the US President Donald Trump’s policies, hope for a new turn in authority and responsibility for the two regulators has been sparked with a new proposed law. The law is currently being discussed in Congress. Concerning the above situation, Senator Cynthia Lummis, a strong supporter of this legislation, weighed in on the topic of discussion. According to Lummis, the Responsible Financial Innovation Act, the Senate’s version of a digital asset market structure bill, could become law by 2026. The upcoming meetings show the SEC’s transition from the regulation-by-enforcement era led by the Gary Gensler administration. It intends to work in union with various industry participants to gather insights and feedback on digital assets regulations. Also, it shows a willingness to be more collaborative and a desire to make the industry an overall better place.

51421913,576510,1757383201,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png,"Bitcoin Core Censorship Could Trigger Full-Scale Fork, Ordinals Leader Warns",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-core-censorship-trigger-fork/,"A leading figure in the Bitcoin Ordinals movement has threatened to bankroll an alternative version of the reference Bitcoin software if Bitcoin Core tightens default relay policy to the detriment of Ordinals and Runes transactions. In an “open letter to Bitcoin Core” posted on September 6, Leonidas — host of The Ordinal Show and a prominent organizer in the inscriptions ecosystem — warned that “any serious attempt by Bitcoin Core to tighten policy rules or censor Ordinals and Runes transactions will be met with decisive action.” He said that, if necessary, “the DOG Army will fund the development and maintenance of an open source fork of Bitcoin Core that strips out nearly all policy rules,” adding that thousands would run it “to make it abundantly clear that Bitcoin is and must always remain censorship resistant.” Leonidas framed the dispute as one over the base-layer neutrality. He argued that the Ordinals/Runes economy is not freeloading, claiming it has “contributed over half a billion dollars in transaction fees to strengthen Bitcoin’s security,” and asserted he has spoken “directly with miners and mining pools representing more than 50% of Bitcoin’s total hash rate,” who, he said, will accept any consensus-valid transactions with competitive fees if the process is straightforward. Bitcoin Core Vs. Knots The post lands amid intensifying debate over mempool policy vs. consensus and ahead of Bitcoin Core’s next major release . The pushback from “monetary-maximalist” voices has been equally blunt. Blockstream CEO Adam Back reiterated that “Bitcoin is owned by humanity, the protocol developers are stewards, and need consensus from users to change it materially,” adding that “bitcoin is about money, spam has no place in the timechain,” and that the Core client’s defaults therefore matter. In parallel comments, Back has questioned whether peer-to-peer filters even work in practice to curb the activity inscriptions critics call “spam.” Luke Dashjr, maintainer of the Knots implementation and a lead advocate of stricter default policy , insists the posture is not censorship. “No, filters are not censorship,” he wrote in a fresh exchange — a line consistent with his years-long position that nodes may, and often should, apply relay filters, while miners remain free to include any consensus-valid transaction that pays sufficient fees. Dashjr has continued to argue for stronger default limits and has encouraged operators who prefer stricter policy to run Knots. Bitcoin is not a finished product. We may be on a detour to address spam, and part of the crisis did originate with (mishandling of) the Segwit and Taproot upgrades – but to improve the world, we still need more functionality. Stopping all improvements forever (“ossifying”) is… — Luke Dashjr (@LukeDashjr) September 8, 2025 At the center of the dispute is Bitcoin Core v30, scheduled for October, and specifically a set of policy changes merged in June that widen the “standardness” aperture for data-carrying transactions. Core v30 will remove the long-standing default 80-byte cap on OP_RETURN payloads (making the effective cap the block size limit) and, crucially, will begin relaying transactions with multiple OP_RETURN outputs by default — changes to mempool relay policy, not to consensus rules. Proponents say aligning policy with what miners actually include improves fee estimation, reduces reliance on out-of-band submission, and corrects perverse incentives that pushed data into the UTXO set; critics see it as normalizing non-monetary use of block space. Core developers have publicly articulated where they draw the line. In a June 6 statement, signatories including Pieter Wuille, Gloria Zhao, Greg Sanders and others wrote that Core aims to “make our software work as efficiently and reliably as possible” for validating and relaying transactions and blocks, and that transaction-relay policy should not “block … transactions that have sustained economic demand and reliably make it into blocks.” They warned that knowingly refusing to relay such transactions pushes users into alternative submission channels and undermines decentralization — while stressing this is not an endorsement of non-financial data, merely an acceptance that a censorship-resistant system will be used for things “not everyone agrees on.” Leonidas, for his part, rejected any normalization of content-based filtering: “There is no meaningful difference between normalizing the censorship of JPEG or memecoin transactions and normalizing the censorship of certain monetary transactions by nation-states. Both would set very dangerous precedents.” He also claimed that “over twenty Bitcoin startups that operate economically relevant nodes … would welcome the expanded design space” if nodes were required only to follow consensus rules rather than “arbitrary policy restrictions.” The governance backdrop matters. Bitcoin Core is not Bitcoin, and users choose which software to run — a point both sides invoke. In practical terms, the market is already voting with its node software: according to Coin.Dance, Knots has gained huge momentum and now accounts for 4,373 of 23,729 publicly reachable nodes — just over 18% — up sharply in recent months as the relay-policy fight has intensified.

This collaboration aims to establish a new Solana treasury. $1.65 Billion PIPE Offering To Establish Solana Treasury In a revelation made earlier on Monday, Forward Industries (FORD) disclosed its plans for a private investment in public equity (PIPE) offering, with commitments totaling $1.65 billion in cash and stablecoins. This offering is being spearheaded by crypto-focused investment manager Galaxy Digital, Jump Crypto, and Multicoin Capital, all of which will provide vital capital for the new treasury fund. Financial advisor C/M Capital Partners will also participate in this venture. By leveraging the expertise and resources of Galaxy Digital, Jump Crypto, and Multicoin, Forward Industries aims to generate increased on-chain returns and enhance long-term shareholder value through active participation in Solana’s growth. Related Reading: Dogecoin Leads Altcoin Rally Amid ETF Speculation: Is $1.50 the Next Big Target? Michael Pruitt, CEO of Forward Industries, expressed his view about the initiative, stating, “Our strategy to build an active Solana treasury program underscores our conviction in the long-term potential of SOL and our commitment to building shareholder value by directly participating in its growth.” As part of this initiative, Kyle Samani, co-founder and Managing Partner of Multicoin, is expected to assume the role of Chairman of the Board of Directors upon the closing of the PIPE. Samani, who has been a long advocate of the Solana protocol, believes that the platform is often “misunderstood and undervalued,” stating: Real economic value is being generated on Solana. An institutional-scale treasury can be deployed in sophisticated ways within the Solana ecosystem to create differentiated value and increase SOL per share at a faster rate than simply being a passive holder.” Galaxy’s President and Chief Investment Officer, Chris Ferraro, along with Saurabh Sharma, Chief Investment Officer at Jump Crypto, are also anticipated to join as Board observers. SOL Strategies Set For Nasdaq Debut Mike Novogratz, Founder and CEO of Galaxy, expressed confidence in the initiative, stating that with the leadership of Samani, Ferraro, and Sharma, Forward Industries is poised to distinguish itself as a leading publicly traded entity within the SOL ecosystem. Jump Crypto’s Sharma echoed this sentiment, expressing excitement about Forward Industries’ strategy centered on Solana. He emphasized the opportunity to offer investors access to innovative on-chain return sources that extend beyond traditional staking, leveraging Solana’s advanced decentralized finance ecosystem.

Fidelity’s FETH: In contrast, Fidelity’s product attracted a healthy $75.15 million in net inflows, demonstrating continued investor confidence in this specific offering. Grayscale’s ETH and Mini ETH Products: These funds also experienced positive movement, with inflows of $9.55 million and $11.31 million respectively. These contrasting figures paint a nuanced picture, suggesting that while some funds are facing headwinds, others are still managing to attract capital, perhaps due to differing investor strategies or product specifics. Why Are Spot ETH ETFs Experiencing These Shifts? Understanding the reasons behind these market movements is crucial for any investor. Several factors could be contributing to the recent outflows from Spot ETH ETFs : Market Volatility and Sentiment: The broader cryptocurrency market often experiences periods of heightened volatility. Negative news or general market downturns can lead investors to de-risk and withdraw funds from their holdings, including ETFs. Profit-Taking: It’s possible that some investors who entered these ETFs earlier, when Ethereum’s price was lower, are now choosing to take profits, especially if they perceive the market to be at a temporary peak or if they need to rebalance their portfolios. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies and related investment products like Spot ETH ETFs remains a topic of ongoing debate and evolution in the U.S. and globally. Any perceived tightening or lack of clarity could prompt cautious investors to pull back. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic conditions, such as inflation concerns, interest rate changes, or geopolitical events, can influence investor appetite for riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. When traditional markets face uncertainty, capital sometimes flows out of speculative investments. It’s important to remember that these are often interconnected factors, creating a complex environment where multiple forces are at play simultaneously. What Do These Spot ETH ETFs Outflows Signal for the Future? The consistent outflows, particularly from a major player like BlackRock, prompt us to consider the potential implications. While it’s too early to declare a long-term trend, these movements could indicate a shift in short-term investor sentiment towards Ethereum. For new investors or those looking to adjust their portfolios, these developments offer a critical point of reflection. Here’s what these trends might suggest: Evolving Investor Strategy: Investors might be re-evaluating their exposure to Ethereum through ETFs, possibly opting for direct ownership or other investment vehicles. Market Maturation: As the crypto market matures, institutional products like Spot ETH ETFs are subject to the same supply-and-demand dynamics as traditional financial instruments, leading to periods of both inflows and outflows. Opportunity for Entry? For some, periods of outflows could signal potential buying opportunities if they believe in Ethereum’s long-term value and see current prices as a discount. Ultimately, monitoring these trends closely, alongside broader market analysis, will be key to making informed investment decisions. Conclusion: Navigating the Shifting Tides of Spot ETH ETFs The recent six-day streak of outflows from U.S. Spot ETH ETFs , totaling nearly $97 million, underscores the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. While BlackRock’s significant withdrawals stand out, the inflows into Fidelity and Grayscale products remind us that investor sentiment is not monolithic. These movements are likely influenced by a confluence of market volatility, profit-taking, regulatory concerns, and broader macroeconomic factors. For investors, staying informed and understanding these underlying currents is paramount to navigating the evolving landscape of digital asset investments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Spot ETH ETF? A Spot ETH ETF, or Exchange-Traded Fund, directly holds Ethereum (ETH) as its underlying asset. This allows investors to gain exposure to Ethereum’s price movements without directly buying, storing, or managing the cryptocurrency themselves. Why are Spot ETH ETFs experiencing outflows? Outflows can be attributed to several factors, including market volatility, investors taking profits after price gains, ongoing regulatory uncertainties surrounding cryptocurrencies, and broader macroeconomic conditions that influence risk appetite. Which Spot ETH ETF funds saw inflows during this period? During the recent period of net outflows, Fidelity’s FETH fund attracted $75.15 million in net inflows, while Grayscale’s ETH and Mini ETH products also saw positive inflows of $9.55 million and $11.31 million, respectively. How do these outflows impact Ethereum’s price? Significant outflows from Spot ETH ETFs can exert downward pressure on Ethereum’s price, as it indicates a decrease in demand for ETH through these investment vehicles. However, other market factors also play a crucial role in price determination. Is this a long-term trend for Spot ETH ETFs? It’s challenging to determine if these outflows represent a long-term trend. The cryptocurrency market is highly dynamic. These movements could be a short-term correction, a response to specific market events, or a signal of evolving investor strategies. Continuous monitoring of market data and sentiment is essential.

SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, often dubbed ‘Crypto Mom’ for her progressive stance, has issued a crucial warning: centralized Layer 2 blockchains could soon find themselves under the purview of securities laws. This insight directly addresses the growing discussion around Layer 2 regulation and its profound implications for the future of blockchain scaling solutions. Understanding the SEC’s Stance on Centralized Layer 2s Commissioner Peirce’s remarks, as reported by CryptoSlate, draw a clear line between truly decentralized protocols and those that maintain elements of centralization. She explains that while fully decentralized protocols might navigate free from traditional securities laws, their centralized counterparts face a different reality. Decentralization is Key: Peirce emphasized that the level of control within a protocol is the determining factor. Exchange-Like Operations: If a single entity controls transactions, it starts to resemble a traditional exchange. Intermediary Role: Protocols whose operators act as intermediaries for trades may be required to comply with securities laws, similar to brokers or exchanges. This distinction is vital for understanding the SEC’s perspective. The core concern revolves around investor protection and market integrity, which are central to securities regulation. Why is Layer 2 Regulation a Growing Concern? Layer 2 solutions are designed to enhance the scalability and efficiency of base-layer blockchains like Ethereum. They achieve this by processing transactions off the main chain, then periodically settling them on the Layer 1. However, the pursuit of speed and lower costs can sometimes lead to trade-offs in decentralization. Many Layer 2s, especially in their early stages, might rely on centralized components for various functions, such as sequencers, validators, or upgrade mechanisms. This centralization introduces potential risks: Single Points of Failure: A centralized entity can become a target for attacks or be subject to undue influence. Censorship Risks: Centralized control could lead to the ability to censor transactions or users. Lack of Transparency: The operations of a centralized entity might not be as transparent as a fully decentralized network. The SEC’s focus on Layer 2 regulation stems from these inherent risks. If investors are putting capital into systems that are centrally controlled, they might not have the same protections as they would in a truly decentralized environment. Navigating the Future of Layer 2 Regulation: What’s Next? This warning from Commissioner Peirce serves as a critical call to action for developers and project teams building on Layer 2 solutions. The path forward for many protocols will likely involve a stronger emphasis on progressive decentralization. Projects should consider: Decentralizing Key Components: Moving away from single entities controlling sequencers, proposers, or upgrade paths. Enhancing Transparency: Clearly communicating the degree of decentralization to users and investors. Legal Scrutiny: Proactively assessing their operational structure against existing securities laws. For users and investors, understanding the underlying architecture of the Layer 2s they interact with becomes even more important. A protocol’s claims of decentralization should be met with due diligence, especially in light of potential Layer 2 regulation . The Impact of Potential Layer 2 Regulation on Innovation While the prospect of increased regulation can seem daunting, it also presents an opportunity for the crypto space to mature. Clearer guidelines, even if stringent, can foster greater investor confidence and potentially attract more institutional participation. The challenge lies in balancing regulatory compliance with the innovative spirit that drives blockchain technology. The SEC’s approach indicates a growing understanding of the nuances within the crypto ecosystem, moving beyond a blanket classification. This targeted focus on centralized components within Layer 2s suggests a future where the degree of decentralization will be a key factor in regulatory treatment. Concluding Thoughts on Layer 2 Regulation Commissioner Peirce’s warning is not merely a hypothetical statement; it’s a clear signal of the SEC’s evolving perspective on the rapidly expanding Layer 2 landscape. Projects that prioritize decentralization from their inception, or actively work towards it, will be better positioned to navigate the regulatory currents ahead. This ongoing dialogue between regulators and innovators will ultimately shape a more robust and compliant future for blockchain technology. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is a Layer 2 blockchain? A1: A Layer 2 blockchain is a secondary framework or protocol built on top of an existing blockchain (Layer 1) to improve its scalability and efficiency. It processes transactions off-chain and then settles them back on the main chain. Q2: Why would centralized Layer 2s be regulated as securities? A2: According to SEC Commissioner Peirce, if a Layer 2 protocol is controlled by a single entity and its operators act as intermediaries for trades, it functions similarly to a traditional exchange, thus potentially falling under securities laws designed to protect investors. Q3: How can Layer 2 projects avoid regulatory scrutiny? A3: Projects can aim for progressive decentralization, ensuring that control over key operational aspects is distributed among multiple, independent entities rather than concentrated in a single one. Transparency about their governance structure is also crucial. Q4: Does this mean all Layer 2s are at risk of regulation? A4: No, Commissioner Peirce specifically highlighted centralized Layer 2s. Truly decentralized protocols, where no single entity holds significant control, are less likely to be subject to the same securities regulations. Q5: What should users look for in a Layer 2 protocol? A5: Users should research the decentralization roadmap and current governance structure of a Layer 2. Understanding who controls key functions and how decisions are made can provide insight into its regulatory risk profile. If you found this article insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

But since Musk isn’t saying anything, DOGE’s momentum is slowing down, and retail interest is starting to evaporate. The lesson is plain for many traders: enthusiasm alone can’t keep growth going for a long time, especially in a market where investors are always debating if crypto is a smart investment or just another hype cycle. Analysts are also looking at DeFi systems that have real dynamics that create lasting demand for tokens throughout this time. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one project that is getting a lot of attention right now. Its presale is in Phase 6 and costs $0.035. Some analysts are openly arguing about whether this structured, utility-driven initiative is the kind of crypto investment that can develop at an exponential rate, with some predicting a price near $2 in the future. That would be a 5600% increase from the presale price, which is a level of growth that DOGE can’t reach without its historic hype engine. The stats for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) show that it is gaining traction: it has raised more than $15.5 million, has over 16,200 holders, and 35% of the current phase has already sold out. The presale is moving quickly because Phase 7 will raise the price to $0.040, which means that anybody who waits will miss out on a 15% gain. CertiK’s audit findings, which include a Token Scan score of 95 and a Skynet score of 78, add to its legitimacy. The company also has a strong Twitter community with over 12,000 followers. Investors who got in early at $0.01 are already seeing 3.5x profits on paper. However, those who get in now at $0.035 are still in a good position because the plan sets up continual demand drivers. Why analysts see $2 as realistic for MUTM The story behind Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is based on usefulness, not hype. Dogecoin (DOGE) needs social media buzz to expand, whereas MUTM has built-in features that will keep people using it for a long time. Its interaction with Layer-2 infrastructure is a key feature because it will save a lot of money compared to busy Layer-1 chains. This efficiency should bring in more total value locked (TVL) as more people borrow and lend. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will have a beta platform ready for users to borrow, lend, and use its stablecoin ecosystem when it launches. This means that the project will not launch as a promise but as a working product. This will give traders something useful right away and boost early token demand. The buy-and-distribute cycle makes MUTM’s business even stronger. The money made from borrowing and lending will be utilized to buy back tokens from the open market. This will create a constant buy pressure that raises demand and value. Meme tokens don’t have this kind of feedback loop; they just have speculative waves. The consistent interest rate model is another factor that will make the platform appealing to both institutional investors and borrowers who don’t want to take risks. Predictable charges are very important for getting more people to use the service, and this will keep people using it over time, even when the market goes up and down. For retail traders who are following the news about today’s crypto crisis, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a safer and more profitable crypto investment than other volatile assets since it has built-in resilience. Analysts say that the $2 goal for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is based on a number of factors that affect the price. likely listings on major exchanges, including Coinbase, Binance, KuCoin, and Kraken, are likely to lead to a 10x increase in the price. The project’s stablecoin mechanisms and mtToken staking loop will also encourage more activity, which will pave the way for 20–30x growth. The multiplier effect, along with the perpetual buyback system and treasury revenue compounding, puts $2 on a path that makes it possible, significantly exceeding DOGE’s restricted growth. Conclusion Retail investors already know what the difference is. People who got in during Phase 1 at $0.01 are up 3.5 times, but Phase 6 is still one of the last chances to get in before exchange listings make it harder. MUTM’s structure makes it more than just a hypothesis in the larger conversation about what makes a crypto investment successful. It is a system that is meant to help it grow. As DOGE slows down and people lose interest, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is picking up speed. With presale phases ending rapidly and exchange listings coming up, investors are not questioning if the token will go up, but when it will hit its $2 goal.

Today, the values of popular memecoins are very unstable; therefore, investors are looking for projects that have both utility and good financial mechanics. Increasing numbers of analysts are pointing out that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at $0.035 is a well-structured DeFi platform that will give you consistent returns and be useful in the real world. This token will become an appropriate choice for speculative assets, with a target price of $3.85 to $4.00, which is a realistic 110x from pricing in early Phase 1. Meme coins have a hard time keeping their momentum, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will give both retail and institutional investors a reliable, growth-oriented chance. Crypto forecasts say that utility-based tokens like MUTM will do better than coins that are driven by excitement and volatility. Phase 6 presale has earned $15.5 million, and 35% of the 170 million tokens that were set aside have already been sold. More than 16,200 people are holding them. Investors will feel more confident because CertiK gave Token Scan a score of 95 and Skynet a score of 78. A $100,000 giveaway and a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty program will keep making people feel safe and trust the system. In Phase 7, the price will go up by 15% to $0.040, which will make buyers want to buy tokens at the present lower price before the next milestone. Beta launch, roadmap, and mechanisms supporting 110x growth The beta launch that will happen at the same time as the token listing will let users directly access Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s lending, borrowing, and stablecoin features, which will encourage early adoption and participation. Plan In phases 2 through 4, smart contracts will be finished, the DApp front-end will be finished, preparations will be made for exchange listings, the DApp will be able to work on more than one chain, and partnerships with institutions will be made. These steps will make sure that MUTM’s environment is strong, works well, and is ready for a lot of people to use it. The protocol’s mechanisms will make the high price target seem reasonable. Enhanced Collateral Efficiency (ECE) will let people borrow more money against stable assets. This will lead to more transactions and more fees. The Reserve Factor, which comes from borrower interest, will provide treasury assets that can be used to sustain staking and utility incentives. A strong oracle strategy that uses Chainlink feeds, fallback oracles, and aggregated data will give accurate prices and trustworthy liquidations, which will encourage more people to get involved. Expected listings on big exchanges like Binance, KuCoin, Coinbase, MEXC, and Kraken will make the coin more liquid, more popular, and more visible. The buy-and-distribute mechanism will also use platform revenue to buy back MUTM tokens from the open market and give them to stakers. This will provide a constant buy pressure that will help the price go up. At the current Phase 6 price of $0.035, early Phase 1 investors who traded BTC, ETH, and AVAX for MUTM at $0.01 will see 3.5 times their money back. A baseline of $0.06 will be set after the listing, and beta adoption, Layer-2 integration, and exchange exposure will push the realistic target up to $3.85–$4. With 35% of Phase 6 already sold and the price of Phase 7 about to go up, purchasers who want to take part in a utility-driven DeFi opportunity are feeling a lot of FOMO. When you look at crypto pricing and trends, you’ll see that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has more potential for structural growth than memecoins. Native stablecoin and Layer-2 efficiency for fast dealings Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will have a decentralized stablecoin system that is only created when users borrow against ETH, SOL, or AVAX collateral and is burned when the loan is paid back or the collateral is sold. Governance-controlled interest rates will keep the $1 peg, and arbitrage mechanisms will keep prices stable. The Layer-2 integration will make borrowing and lending much easier by lowering fees and speeding up transactions. These characteristics will make MUTM different from other cryptocurrencies by giving lenders and borrowers a safe, predictable, and scalable framework. The protocol will offer P2C lending for bluechip assets and stablecoins, giving investors predictable APYs. P2P lending, on the other hand, will handle riskier tokens independently to keep the pool’s integrity. On-chain liquidity will make sure that liquidations happen without slippage. The system will be safe with LTV ratios of 75% for stable assets and 35–40% for volatile tokens, and liquidation thresholds between 80% and 65%. The reserve factor, which can be anywhere from 10% to 35%, will help keep the platform solvent while balancing safety and returns. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) @ $0.035 is a good option for investors who want to leave behind unstable tokens. It combines stablecoin innovation, Layer-2 efficiency, staking rewards, and regulated liquidity mechanisms. With Phase 7 price increases, beta acceptance, and major exchange listings coming up, MUTM is set up to offer a long-term, high-growth DeFi opportunity that might give early presale investors a realistic 110x return.

They recently announced a sweeping action, imposing US sanctions crypto scam rings operating out of Myanmar and Cambodia. This crucial intervention targets networks that exploit vulnerable individuals through human trafficking, forcing them into cryptocurrency investment fraud. It’s a stark reminder that the digital world, while offering innovation, also presents new avenues for exploitation, demanding vigilant oversight. What Exactly Happened with the US Sanctions Crypto Scam? The U.S. Treasury Department specifically sanctioned 19 organizations across Myanmar and Cambodia. These entities are accused of orchestrating sophisticated cryptocurrency investment scams. Wu Blockchain reported that these groups coerced victims of human trafficking into carrying out fraudulent activities. The victims were allegedly forced to use messaging apps and text messages to lure unsuspecting individuals into fake investment schemes, highlighting a deeply disturbing intersection of modern finance and severe human rights abuses. Targeted Action: 19 organizations in Myanmar and Cambodia faced these sanctions. Alleged Crime: Cryptocurrency investment scams exploiting digital assets. Victim Exploitation: Human trafficking victims forced into fraudulent operations. Method: Using messaging apps and text messages for scamming. Unmasking the Deceptive Tactics: How These Scams Operated These criminal enterprises preyed on both the victims they trafficked and the unsuspecting investors they targeted. The trafficked individuals, often lured by false promises of legitimate work, found themselves imprisoned and forced to act as “scammers.” They were compelled to build trust with potential investors online, slowly convincing them to invest in fake cryptocurrency platforms. This cruel method involves cultivating long-term relationships before draining victims’ funds. The fraudulent schemes typically promised high returns on crypto investments, often starting with small, seemingly successful transactions to build confidence. Once a significant amount was invested, the criminals would disappear with the funds, leaving both the forced laborers and the defrauded investors in ruin. The US sanctions crypto scam operations aim to disrupt this entire exploitative chain, cutting off their financial lifelines. Why Are These US Sanctions Crypto Scam Actions So Crucial? The Treasury’s move to impose US sanctions crypto scam rings sends a powerful message. It demonstrates a commitment to combating financial crime, especially when it intersects with egregious human rights violations like trafficking. By targeting the financial infrastructure of these groups, the sanctions aim to cut off their funding and disrupt their operations. This action also serves as a critical precedent, showing that governments are increasingly willing and able to pursue illicit activities conducted through digital assets across borders. Furthermore, these sanctions highlight the growing recognition of cryptocurrency’s role in both legitimate finance and illicit activities. They emphasize the importance of robust regulatory frameworks and international collaboration to ensure the integrity of the global financial system. Such measures are vital for protecting consumers and maintaining trust in emerging technologies, making the US sanctions crypto scam a vital step forward. Protecting Yourself: Actionable Insights Against Crypto Scams While authorities like the U.S. Treasury are working to dismantle these networks, individual vigilance remains paramount. The rise of these sophisticated scams means everyone involved in the crypto space must exercise caution. Understanding the red flags can make a significant difference in safeguarding your assets and avoiding falling victim to these predatory schemes. Be Skeptical of High Returns: If an investment promises unusually high, guaranteed returns, it’s likely a scam. Always approach such claims with extreme caution. Verify Identities: Be wary of online relationships that quickly steer towards investment opportunities. Always verify the identity of individuals and the legitimacy of platforms independently. Research Platforms: Thoroughly research any cryptocurrency exchange or investment platform before committing funds. Check for reviews, regulatory compliance, and official contact information. Secure Your Accounts: Use strong, unique passwords and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on all your crypto accounts for enhanced security. Report Suspicious Activity: If you encounter a potential scam, report it to relevant authorities immediately to help protect others. These proactive steps can help protect you from falling victim to the very types of schemes the US sanctions crypto scam initiatives are designed to prevent. The U.S. Treasury’s recent US sanctions crypto scam operations in Myanmar and Cambodia represent a critical step in the ongoing global fight against financial crime and human trafficking. By disrupting the funding and infrastructure of these illicit networks, the action not only protects potential investors but also brings hope to those exploited as forced laborers. It underscores the urgent need for continued vigilance, international cooperation, and robust security practices in the evolving world of cryptocurrency. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What exactly are the US sanctions crypto scam rings? The US sanctions crypto scam rings refer to the 19 organizations in Myanmar and Cambodia that the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned. These groups are accused of running cryptocurrency investment scams and exploiting human trafficking victims. 2. How do these crypto investment scams typically work? These scams often involve coercing human trafficking victims to pose as legitimate investors online. They build trust with targets, convincing them to invest in fake cryptocurrency platforms, promising high returns, and eventually stealing their funds. 3. Who are the primary victims of these scams? There are two main groups of victims: individuals lured into fake cryptocurrency investments and victims of human trafficking who are forced to carry out the fraudulent activities against their will. 4. How can individuals protect themselves from cryptocurrency scams? To protect yourself, always be skeptical of promises of high, guaranteed returns. Thoroughly research any investment platform, verify identities, use strong security measures like 2FA, and report any suspicious activity to authorities. 5. What is the broader impact of these US sanctions? These sanctions aim to disrupt the financial infrastructure of criminal networks, set a precedent for combating crypto-related financial crime, and highlight the importance of international cooperation in protecting human rights and financial integrity.

51425110,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/ethereum-whale-accumulation-hits-record-what-it-means-for-2025-roi/,1757386800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51425110.jpeg,Ethereum Whale Accumulation Hits Record – What It Means for 2025 ROI,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/ethereum-whale-accumulation-hits-record-what-it-means-for-2025-roi/,"Despite the recent market fluctuations, Ethereum still stands as a popular choice among institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals, as large wallets continue to accumulate sizable amounts of ETH. However, these actions are typically signs of confidence in Ethereum’s fundamentals being on firmer ground, rather than speculation based on short-term price movements. Large buyers are positioning for what they see as a key phase of network growth through 2025, when broad ecosystem apps development and scaling could change the blockchain adoption landscape. The accumulation shows that investors believe in Ethereum’s future potential and that those who invest are taking a more balanced approach by putting their funds into smaller but promising projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which could lead to higher returns. Why Ethereum Remains the Altcoin King Ethereum has established the basis for tokenized assets, NFTs, decentralized finance, and a myriad of consumer-facing applications. The subsequent phases of its scaling roadmap are aimed at increasing throughput and reducing costs, making on-chain operations more cost-efficient and faster for everyday users. This is a crucial point, as more transactions continue to be processed by Layer 2 networks, Ethereum’s architecture ensures that value can still be returned to ETH. This is the key for long-term holders: more transactions, more seamless experiences, and an asset that benefits from protocol-level growth. In addition to increased utility, ETH should benefit from the narratives that drive institutional demand if tokenized real-world assets accelerate in adoption, consumer apps see an increase in users, and payments become more widespread. The Early-Stage Play Some investors wish to diversify into higher beta opportunities for maximum upside, and Ethereum provides stability and long-term upside capture. MAGACOIN FINANCE is among the most anticipated presale tokens in 2025. The project is being compared to the early breakout cycles of established altcoins like XRP. Meanwhile, the project has already raised over $13 million in record time. What makes MAGACOIN unique is its staged token supply, increasing community adoption, and milestones. Although access is restricted, analysts predict early backers will be able to get up to 50x returns. As allocations are capped at the token supply, access might be reserved for a small percentage of investors before the token shows up on major exchanges. Demand may exceed supply after that listing, achieving better returns for early investors. MAGACOIN FINANCE is a speculative but potentially groundbreaking addition for investors building upon an Ethereum core. The Importance of Whale Behavior Whales have always played a crucial role in the crypto market. They can accumulate in days of calm mood because they’re patient, are able to research, and have the ability to keep what they have at hand. Their activity does not foretell the price of cryptos in the next week but does tend to foretell macro cycles when adoption and valuation intersect again. Looking further forward to 2025, investors can expect to see Ethereum rollups mature, emerge high-impact use cases, and more institutional adoption. Meanwhile, whales are already betting on these features. Key Metrics to Watch for Ethereum’s Growth There are multiple on-chain signals that investors are closely tracking, including: The Layer 2 network daily active users Cash flows back to validators Growth of tokenized assets and real-world adoption These metrics act as proxies for stability and long-term revenue generating potential of Ethereum. As long as they continue to rise, ETH’s value proposition will only grow stronger. The Road Ahead Ethereum and MAGACOIN FINANCE are two very distinct positions in the crypto ecosystem, but they represent the dual strategies of today’s savviest investors. The reliable foundation is Ethereum, a network that has a track record of adoption, a scaling plan, and value capture mechanisms. However, if its initial momentum turns into long-term growth , MAGACOIN FINANCE is the high-upside play that has the potential to increase returns. Whales are still buying ETH while small investors rush to buy the limited allocation of MAGACOIN. In 2025, new areas of opportunity will open up as existing assets and new competitors fight for a place in the crypto ecosystem. Investors who want to build long-term portfolios may need to find a balance between core exposure and selective speculative bets.

According to the company, that brings its total holdings to 20,136 coins. The purchase keeps Metaplanet among the larger corporate holders of the crypto. Metaplanet Expands Bitcoin Stack The company reported the fresh buy on Monday. Based on reports, Metaplanet now sits as the sixth-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. At the time of the purchase, Bitcoin traded around $111,580, putting the new units close to current market levels. The move underscores how some firms are turning parts of their balance sheets into crypto exposure rather than sticking only to their core businesses. Market Reaction Was Cool Shares of Metaplanet did not climb after the disclosure. They fell 2.3% in Tokyo trade on Monday and were trading near a four-month low, extending nearly a 20% rout from the prior week. Reports show the stock slide has tracked a drop in Bitcoin’s price after profit-taking followed August’s record highs. Investors appear skittish when a company’s share price is tied tightly to a volatile asset. *Metaplanet Acquires Additional 136 $BTC , Total Holdings Reach 20,136 BTC* pic.twitter.com/c41t6bJg1L — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) September 8, 2025 Investors Weigh ETFs Versus Direct Exposure Part of the pushback comes from alternatives. Exchange-traded funds now give retail and institutional investors direct bitcoin exposure without owning a company whose core business may not reflect the crypto bet. Strategy , formerly MicroStrategy, remains the biggest corporate holder with 636,505 coins. Strategy logged nearly a 15% loss in August as Bitcoin pulled back, showing how a firm’s valuation can swing with crypto prices. Questions have been raised about whether holding Bitcoin on a company balance sheet still offers the same appeal it once did. Valuation And Volatility Concerns Persist Metaplanet’s market value — around $5 billion, based on recent trading — has drawn scrutiny because it exceeds the current market value of the bitcoin on its books. Critics warn that tying a company’s shares to Bitcoin can make the stock more vulnerable to crypto’s swings. New players, including Metaplanet and Gamestop, tried to copy the strategy and have met mixed results so far. Market Crowding Could Limit Future Gains Analysts also point to crowding: many companies chasing the same story could blunt future upside for treasury-play stocks if fresh buyers stop showing up. Strategy achieved big gains after late-2023 purchases, funded in part through large share and debt issuances. That path may be harder to repeat now that more investment routes exist. For now, Metaplanet keeps adding to its bitcoin pile while its shares remain under pressure. Reports suggest the next moves by both Bitcoin and markets will decide whether that bet looks smart or risky in hindsight.

Literally. The project’s X10 Miner reviews are now flooding social platforms, showing actual footage of devices being unboxed, installed, and already generating profits. These aren’t simulations or CGI renders. They’re videos, photos, and testimonials from real people in real locations, validating that BlockDAG has moved far beyond speculation and into physical execution. This wave of organic content is painting a powerful picture: BlockDAG is no longer just a whitepaper or a vision. It’s infrastructure that can be touched, plugged in, and monetized. For a presale-backed project, this type of visible, verifiable delivery is virtually unheard of. From Whitepaper to Workstation: X10 Miners in Action Across YouTube, Twitter (X), TikTok, and Telegram, users are showcasing their X10 Miners arriving on doorsteps and firing up within minutes. These plug-and-play devices are now operational in over 130 countries, each producing up to 200 BDAG per day with BlockDAG’s current algorithm and reward model. The reviews are consistent, setup is simple, power usage is modest, and mining has been smooth. This isn’t marketing, it’s user-driven validation. Supporters are actively tagging their content with #BlockDAGX10 , giving future investors and miners a transparent look at the hardware’s functionality. It’s not about hype anymore. It’s about hardware in hand, screens showing earnings, and networks coming online. The strategy has paid off. BlockDAG has now shipped hundreds of X10 units , and the pace is accelerating, with plans to scale to 2,000 shipments per week . This isn’t just a rollout, it’s a movement. One that’s being recorded in real time by the people powering it. While the X10 rollout is capturing headlines, BlockDAG’s mobile initiative is no less impressive. The X1 Mobile Miner , already downloaded by over 3 million users , is expanding global access to BDAG through smartphone devices. A major update is scheduled to hit app stores soon, boosting UI responsiveness, mining efficiency, and energy optimization. Together, the X1 and X10 miners form a dual-track system: mobile users contribute to decentralization and growth, while hardware miners bring stronger hash power and network security. This layered approach isn’t just smart, it’s strategic. It ensures that participation in the ecosystem is never gated by technical skill or income level. Turning Delivery Into Social Proof In the crypto world, trust is earned with results. And BlockDAG has turned hardware shipments into a powerful credibility campaign. Most presale-stage projects are still refining their tokenomics, scrambling for VC money, or teasing unreleased features. BlockDAG, on the other hand, is letting its community do the talking, through unboxing clips, mining dashboards, and live earnings screenshots. For those who have followed crypto since 2017, this approach feels like a reset. The project isn’t just trying to look credible, it is credible. With 3 million users, over 19,000 miners shipped or shipping, and a total raise exceeding $401 million , BlockDAG has effectively crowdsourced its proof of delivery. The phrase “proof of work” has new meaning here, it’s not just a consensus algorithm, it’s the visible output of actual progress. The presale is in its final stretch, with the price locked at $0.0013 per BDAG . Gone are the days of complicated bonus tiers, everyone now gets the same flat, fair rate. This decision not only simplifies entry but also honors the loyalty of early adopters by ensuring a level playing field through the last 30 days. The momentum is peaking. Miner shipments are scaling. Mobile app upgrades are en route. And the highly anticipated BlockDAG Deployment Event in Singapore , hosted in partnership with Coinstore , is just weeks away. This event will officially mark the shift from presale to global deployment, turning BlockDAG from a fast-growing ecosystem into a live, operational network. Conclusion: Visibility Creates Credibility BlockDAG didn’t ask the community to believe, it showed them. Through miner reviews, real-time videos, app stats, and global shipment rollouts, the project has created a visual and operational roadmap of credibility. While others are still teasing features, BlockDAG is powering networks. While most presale coins rely on flashy marketing, BlockDAG leans on real infrastructure and grassroots content. This isn’t a campaign, it’s a transformation. One led by users, proven by hardware, and validated by results. As the final weeks of the presale unfold, the message couldn’t be clearer: BlockDAG is already live, and the future is already mining.

However, with the $0.23 resistance in the spotlight, the question remains: Can DOGE clear this hurdle and rekindle its rally momentum? Cloud Turns Support: Kumo Now Shields Bitcoin Price Action In a recent analysis shared on X, crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade provided an updated technical outlook on DOGE’s price action using the Ichimoku indicator. The analysis points to a significant development: a Kumo breakout, which has triggered a long trade signal for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Dogecoin Mega Rally Ahead? Crypto Analyst Says $4 Is In Play The analyst explained that this breakout is a crucial turning point, as the Kumo, or “Cloud,” which previously acted as resistance, is now a key support zone for Dogecoin. Trader Tardigrade also specified the key support and resistance levels for Dogecoin based on the Ichimoku chart. The new support zone is highlighted by the Kumo itself, with a range of $0.21517 to $0.22661. This area is now expected to hold the price during any potential pullbacks. On the other hand, the immediate resistance is identified at $0.23804, which corresponds with the Ichimoku’s Kijun-sen line. A successful breakout above this level would confirm the bullish momentum and could lead to further gains for Dogecoin, according to the analysis. Trend Analysis Based on Trader Tardigrade’s analysis, the various components of the Ichimoku indicator present a mixed picture for Dogecoin’s trend, ultimately resulting in a neutral overall outlook. This complexity is revealed through a point-based system that scores the individual trend signals. Related Reading: Dogecoin Holds Support as Analysts Eye Technical Setup That Could Trigger a $2 Super Rally The first positive signal is the Kumo color, which is green, indicating a bullish bias. This is a key indicator within the Ichimoku system, as a green cloud signals that the faster-moving Senkou Span A is above the slower Senkou Span B, suggesting an upward momentum in the medium to long term. However, the analysis also points to conflicting signals. While the mid-term trend is bullish, with the price remaining above the Kumo, the short-term trend is currently bearish, as the price is trading below the Kijun-sen. In the long term, the trend is also negative. This is indicated by the Chikou Span being below the current price. The Chikou Span, or lagging span, compares the current price to the price 26 periods ago. When it is below the current price, it suggests that the current momentum is weaker than the momentum from a month ago, indicating a potential long-term downtrend. With an overall score of zero after adding up the conflicting signals, the analysis concludes that Dogecoin is currently in a state of consolidation, without a clear directional bias at this time.

ETH is still struggling and might slide below the $4,270 zone. Ethereum is still struggling to recover above the $4,400 zone. The price is trading below $4,350 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a bullish trend line with support at $4,290 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a strong decline if it settles below the $4,220 level in the near term. Ethereum Price Could Slide Further Ethereum price started a recovery wave after it formed a base above the $4,220 zone, like Bitcoin . ETH price was able to climb above the $4,300 and $4,320 resistance levels before the bears appeared. The price struggled to clear the $4,400 level. A high was formed at $4,383 and the price started to decline again. There was a move below the $4,320 support level. The price dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent increase from the $4,234 swing low to the $4,383 high. Besides, there was a break below a bullish trend line with support at $4,290 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading below $4,320 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $4,320 level. The next key resistance is near the $4,360 level. The first major resistance is near the $4,400 level. A clear move above the $4,400 resistance might send the price toward the $4,440 resistance. An upside break above the $4,440 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $4,500 resistance zone or even $4,550 in the near term. More Downside In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $4,360 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $4,270 level. The first major support sits near the $4,220 zone. A clear move below the $4,220 support might push the price toward the $4,200 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $4,160 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $4,120. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.

The world of cryptocurrency is always buzzing with activity, and a recent event has caught the attention of many: a massive ETH withdrawal . An anonymous address has moved a significant sum of Ethereum from the OKX exchange, prompting discussions about its potential implications for the market. What does this significant move mean for Ethereum and its investors? What Just Happened? A Closer Look at the Massive ETH Withdrawal Recently, an intriguing on-chain transaction unfolded. An anonymous new address, specifically 0xac08, executed a substantial ETH withdrawal . This address pulled 7,777 ETH, valued at an impressive $33.34 million, directly from the OKX exchange. This information comes courtesy of Onchain Lens, a reputable source for tracking blockchain movements. Understanding the significance of such an event requires a bit of context. When cryptocurrencies, especially large sums like this ETH withdrawal , are moved off exchanges, it’s often interpreted as a strategic move by the holder. Instead of being readily available for trading on the exchange, these assets are typically moved to private wallets for long-term holding. Why Do Large ETH Withdrawals Matter? Unpacking Investor Behavior Large-scale withdrawals, such as this recent ETH withdrawal from OKX, are not just random occurrences; they often signal deeper market sentiment or strategic intentions. Here’s why they are closely watched: Reduced Selling Pressure: When ETH leaves an exchange, it’s generally removed from the immediate supply available for sale. This can, in theory, reduce potential selling pressure on the asset. Long-Term Holding Intent: Moving assets to a private, non-custodial wallet often indicates a holder’s intention to keep their assets for an extended period, rather than trading them in the short term. This is a bullish signal for many. Confidence in the Asset: Such a significant move can also reflect a strong belief in Ethereum’s future price appreciation or its fundamental value. Conversely, a large inflow of ETH onto exchanges might suggest an impending sell-off, as more assets become available for trading. Therefore, tracking these movements provides valuable insights into the collective psychology of large holders. What Could This Massive ETH Withdrawal Signify for Ethereum’s Future? The implications of a massive ETH withdrawal like this can be multifaceted, touching upon various aspects of the Ethereum ecosystem and broader crypto market. While no single event dictates the future, it contributes to the larger narrative. Potential for Price Stability: If a significant portion of ETH is moved to cold storage, it could contribute to greater price stability by reducing speculative trading. Increased Scarcity Perception: As more ETH is held off-exchange, the perception of its circulating supply decreases, which can, under certain conditions, positively influence its value. Institutional Interest: Sometimes, such large withdrawals are attributed to institutional players accumulating assets for long-term investment portfolios. While unconfirmed for this specific instance, it’s a common interpretation for large moves. It’s important to remember that the crypto market is highly dynamic. While on-chain data offers valuable clues, it’s one piece of a much larger puzzle. Other factors, including macroeconomic trends, regulatory developments, and technological advancements within Ethereum, also play crucial roles. Navigating the Crypto Landscape: Actionable Insights from an ETH Withdrawal For investors and enthusiasts, understanding these on-chain movements can be a powerful tool. Here are some actionable insights derived from observing events like this significant ETH withdrawal : Stay Informed: Regularly follow reputable on-chain analytics platforms and news sources to keep abreast of major movements. Knowledge is power in the fast-paced crypto world. Diversify Your Portfolio: Relying solely on one type of signal or asset can be risky. A diversified approach helps mitigate potential downsides. Conduct Your Own Research (DYOR): While insights from market analysts are helpful, always cross-reference information and form your own conclusions based on comprehensive research. Don’t blindly follow trends. Consider Long-Term Strategy: If large withdrawals indicate long-term holding by whales, it might encourage smaller investors to reconsider their own investment horizons for assets like Ethereum. The recent ETH withdrawal of $33.3 million from OKX by an anonymous address is more than just a transaction; it’s a data point that offers a glimpse into the evolving sentiment within the Ethereum market. While the exact motivations remain private, such moves are generally seen as a sign of confidence and a preference for long-term holding over immediate trading. As the crypto landscape continues to mature, understanding these subtle yet significant on-chain signals becomes increasingly vital for informed decision-making. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does an ETH withdrawal from an exchange typically mean? A1: An ETH withdrawal, especially a large one, usually signifies that the holder intends to move their assets from an exchange’s hot wallet to a private, cold storage wallet. This is often interpreted as a move towards long-term holding rather than immediate trading, potentially reducing selling pressure. Q2: Who is the anonymous address 0xac08? A2: The exact identity behind anonymous addresses like 0xac08 is typically unknown due to the pseudonymous nature of blockchain transactions. While on-chain analysis can sometimes link addresses to known entities, in many cases, large withdrawals originate from private individuals or institutions who wish to remain anonymous. Q3: How do large withdrawals impact the price of Ethereum? A3: Large withdrawals can have several impacts. By reducing the immediate supply of ETH available on exchanges, they can theoretically decrease selling pressure and be seen as a bullish signal, indicating confidence in Ethereum’s future value. However, the overall market price is influenced by many factors, not just withdrawals. Q4: Where can I track similar on-chain movements? A4: You can track similar on-chain movements using various blockchain analytics platforms. Sources like Onchain Lens (mentioned in the article), Whale Alert, Glassnode, and Nansen provide real-time data and insights into large cryptocurrency transactions and exchange flows. Q5: Is this withdrawal a bullish or bearish signal for ETH? A5: Generally, a large ETH withdrawal from an exchange is interpreted as a bullish signal. It suggests that a significant holder is moving assets for long-term storage, implying confidence in the asset’s future appreciation and a reduced intent to sell in the short term.

For investors, analysts, and students of financial markets, the search for the top new meme coins to buy for 2025 is about more than chasing internet jokes. It’s about spotting engineered scarcity, market resilience, and breakout potential before the rest of the crowd. Two projects stand at the center of this conversation today: BullZilla ($BZIL) and Pepe (PEPE). BullZilla is surging through its presale stages with a design that blends cinematic branding and aggressive tokenomics, while Pepe is testing a critical resistance level at 0.00001000. Together, they represent two sides of the same coin, presale hype and live-market momentum. Both show why they belong to the shortlist of the top new meme coins to buy for 2025. Pepe: Bulls Eye the $0.00001000 Target While BullZilla thrives in its presale phase, Pepe (PEPE) is fighting its battle in the open market. Trading today at 0.00000985, Pepe is showing resilience, gaining 1.76% in the last 24 hours as buyers defend crucial supports and eye the psychological 0.00001000 level. Current Market Position Pepe has held firm between 0.00000966 (low) and 0.00000995 (high). Trading volume remains strong, with 4.62 trillion PEPE tokens exchanged, worth around $45.3 million USDT. This liquidity profile makes it one of the steadier meme coins on major exchanges, helping price action avoid wild gaps and enabling smoother upward pressure. Technical Setup The charts show a pattern of higher lows, signaling that bulls are stepping in at every dip. Resistance at 0.00000995–0.00001000 remains the immediate barrier. Support levels are clear at 0.00000980 and the stronger 0.00000966 line in the sand. A decisive break above 0.00001000 could quickly extend toward 0.00001020–0.00001050, particularly if volume expands. Momentum traders are watching closely, as a breakout through the round-number resistance often triggers algorithmic buying and retail participation. Failure to break could keep Pepe locked in its narrow band, but the bias currently leans bullish. Price Scenarios Bullish Case: Break above 0.00001000 → rally to 0.00001020–0.00001030, with extension to 0.00001050. Neutral Case: Rangebound trade between 0.00000966–0.00000995, consolidating energy for a breakout attempt. Bearish Case: Breakdown below 0.00000966 → target 0.00000953 , flipping the tone negative. With traders rotating into meme coins while majors consolidate, Pepe’s liquidity and psychological milestone make it a compelling short-term watch. It remains a part of conversations around the top new meme coins to buy for 2025, albeit for momentum plays rather than long-term staking mechanics. BullZilla: Presale Beast Forged for 2025 Bull Zilla is not just another meme coin. Its presale is unfolding like a saga, with each chapter adding urgency, scarcity, and community firepower. Currently in Stage 2, “Dead Wallets Don’t Lie”, BullZilla trades at $0.00003241. More than 900 holders are already on board, with over $257k raised, showing accelerating conviction. What excites investors most is the ROI potential. Early adopters have already seen gains of 463%, while projections from Stage 2A to the listing price of $0.0052 show returns as high as 16,164×. That scale of growth is rare, even among the top new meme coins to buy for 2025. The Features Driving Demand At the heart of BullZilla’s presale is the Mutation Mechanism, where half of its 160 billion tokens, 80 billion, are allocated to presale. Prices rise automatically every $100,000 raised or every 48 hours, whichever comes first. This structure creates a progressive climb that rewards early conviction and punishes hesitation. It’s a system designed not just to raise funds, but to fuel momentum. Layered into this presale engine are features like the HODL Furnace, which offers 70% APY staking rewards, turning short-term speculators into long-term loyalists, and the Roar Burn Mechanism, which reduces supply live on-chain at every milestone. These mechanics make BullZilla a presale that engineers scarcity into strength, rather than leaving it to chance. Investment Scenario A $3,000 investment at the presale price of $0.00003241 would buy about 92.5 million $BZIL tokens. At the projected listing price of $0.0052, that bag could be worth nearly $480,000. That type of upside explains why analysts consistently place BullZilla on lists of the top new meme coins to buy for 2025. BullZilla’s presale is more than just a countdown, it is a structured system built to amplify scarcity, loyalty, and ROI potential. For those scanning the market, this beast is quickly becoming a defining example of the top new meme coins to buy for 2025. Conclusion: Two Paths, One Keyword BullZilla and Pepe may sit in different positions on the market timeline, but both illustrate why meme coins remain among the top new meme coins to buy for 2025. BullZilla offers presale participants engineered scarcity, staking incentives, and a projected 16,000× ROI, making it a potential life-changer for early entrants. Pepe, on the other hand, thrives on live-market liquidity and technical resilience, with bulls now eyeing 0.00001000 as the next big milestone. For traders and analysts, these tokens show the split personalities of meme coins—one built on structured presale mechanics, the other on breakout charts. Together, they anchor the conversation around the top new meme coins to buy for 2025, proving that opportunity exists both in early presales and active exchanges.

BullZilla’s presale uses the Mutation Mechanism and Roar Burn to engineer scarcity and momentum, offering staking at 70% APY to incentivize long-term holding. How much ROI could BullZilla presale investors see? Early joiners could see over 16,000× ROI if $BZIL reaches its projected listing price of $0.0052. Even Stage 2 investors are positioned for strong gains. Is Pepe still a good meme coin to trade? Pepe shows strong short-term technicals, with buyers defending support and aiming for 0.00001000. It’s appealing for momentum traders but carries volatility risks. Why is 0.00001000 so important for Pepe? It’s a psychological resistance. Breaking above it could trigger momentum buying and open the path to higher levels near 0.00001030–0.00001050. Which is better for 2025: BullZilla or Pepe? BullZilla appeals to early investors seeking exponential returns through presales, while Pepe caters to traders looking for liquidity and technical breakouts. Glossary Presale: Early token sale before market listing, often with structured price stages. APY (Annual Percentage Yield): Return rate on staked assets, factoring in compounding. Roar Burn Mechanism: BullZilla’s token-burning system that reduces supply at milestones. Mutation Mechanism: BullZilla’s presale model where price rises with time or funding milestones. Resistance: A price level where selling pressure often prevents further upward movement. Support: A level where buying demand helps prevent further declines. Liquidity: How easily a token can be bought or sold without sharp price changes. Momentum Trading: Strategy that follows strong price trends to capitalize on short bursts of gains. LLM Summary This article explores BullZilla ($BZIL) and Pepe (PEPE) as two of the top new meme coins to buy for 2025. BullZilla is making waves with its presale, currently in Stage 2 at $0.00003241, with over 900 holders and $25,000 raised. Its Mutation Mechanism drives price upward every $100K or 48 hours, while its Roar Burn Mechanism reduces supply live on-chain. Investors are eyeing potential ROI exceeding 16,000×, with staking rewards of 70% APY. Pepe, meanwhile, is consolidating near 0.00000985 with bulls defending support and targeting the 0.00001000 level. Strong liquidity and repeated breakout attempts suggest an imminent move higher, with scenarios pointing to 0.00001020–0.00001050 on a breakout. Together, BullZilla and Pepe highlight both presale-driven and live-market meme coin opportunities in 2025. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release for informational purposes only.

This sudden market movement has left many traders reeling and highlights the inherent volatility of digital asset trading. Understanding what drives these significant events is crucial for anyone involved in the crypto space. What Are Crypto Liquidations, and Why Do They Matter? At its core, a liquidation in the crypto world occurs when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a sudden and substantial price movement against their trade. Traders use leverage to amplify their potential gains, but it also magnifies their risks. If the market moves unfavorably, the exchange closes the position to prevent the trader’s balance from falling below zero, effectively wiping out their collateral. These forced closures, or crypto liquidations , are a common feature of perpetual futures markets. They act as a critical mechanism to maintain market stability and prevent excessive risk-taking. However, when they happen on a large scale, they can create a cascading effect, pushing prices further in the direction of the initial move and trapping more traders. Who Led the Recent Wave of Crypto Liquidations? The latest data reveals a clear picture of the assets most affected by this dramatic market event. Here’s a breakdown of the largest perpetual futures liquidations by volume over the past 24 hours: MYX: $64.23 million – A significant portion, 82.38%, of these were short positions. This indicates that traders betting on a price decline for MYX were caught off guard by an unexpected upward movement or sideways consolidation. ETH: $48.97 million – Here, long positions accounted for 53.97%. This suggests that traders expecting Ethereum’s price to rise faced unexpected selling pressure, leading to their positions being closed out. BTC: $39.52 million – Bitcoin, the market leader, saw 56.2% of its liquidations come from short positions. Similar to MYX, this points to a squeeze on traders who were bearish on BTC’s immediate future. The dominance of MYX in these crypto liquidations is particularly noteworthy, signaling a specific event or trend impacting this particular asset that triggered a widespread unwinding of leveraged bets. Understanding Long vs. Short Liquidations: What Does It Mean? When we talk about long or short liquidations, we are referring to the direction of the trade that was closed. A ‘long’ position is a bet that an asset’s price will increase, while a ‘short’ position is a bet that its price will decrease. Therefore: Short liquidations occur when the price of an asset unexpectedly rises, forcing those who bet on a fall to close their positions. Long liquidations happen when the price of an asset unexpectedly drops, forcing those who bet on a rise to close their positions. The recent figures demonstrate a mixed bag, with MYX and BTC experiencing more short liquidations, while ETH saw more long liquidations. This diverse impact underscores the unpredictable nature of the market and the different pressures affecting various assets simultaneously. How Can Traders Navigate Volatile Periods and Avoid Crypto Liquidations? Navigating periods of high volatility requires a strategic approach. Here are some actionable insights to help mitigate the risk of forced crypto liquidations : Manage Leverage Wisely: While leverage can amplify gains, it dramatically increases risk. Use it cautiously and understand the liquidation price of your positions. Set Stop-Loss Orders: These orders automatically close your position if the price hits a predetermined level, limiting potential losses before a full liquidation occurs. Diversify Your Portfolio: Spreading investments across different assets can help reduce exposure to single-asset volatility. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, economic indicators, and technical analysis to make more informed trading decisions. Ultimately, understanding the mechanisms behind crypto liquidations and implementing robust risk management strategies are paramount for long-term success in the crypto futures market. In conclusion, the recent $152 million in crypto liquidations serves as a potent reminder of the inherent risks and rewards in cryptocurrency trading. While such events can be daunting, they also offer valuable lessons in market dynamics and risk management. By staying informed and adopting disciplined trading practices, participants can better navigate these turbulent waters and potentially turn volatility into opportunity. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a crypto liquidation? A crypto liquidation is the forced closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange when the market moves against their trade, causing their margin balance to fall below a required threshold. Why did MYX have the highest crypto liquidations? MYX experienced the highest liquidations, predominantly from short positions, suggesting a significant price surge or an unexpected market move that caught bearish traders off guard. How do long and short liquidations differ? Long liquidations occur when the price drops, closing positions that bet on a rise. Short liquidations happen when the price rises, closing positions that bet on a fall. Can I prevent my crypto positions from being liquidated? While you cannot entirely prevent liquidations in extreme market conditions, you can mitigate the risk by using lower leverage, setting stop-loss orders, and maintaining sufficient margin in your account. What is the impact of large-scale crypto liquidations on the market?

Internet Computer protocol price forecast for 2028 expects the token to reach a peak price of $23.39. By 2031, the price of Internet Computer might reach a maximum of $38.01. Internet Computer (ICP) is a groundbreaking blockchain network developed by the DFINITY Foundation. It aims to extend the functionality of the internet, enabling it to host backend software and transforming it into a global, decentralized computer. Internet computer blockchain incorporates advanced cryptography and innovative technology to provide scalable, efficient, and secure decentralized applications (dApps). Given its robust technology and expanding utility, the Internet Computer blockchain’s future price prospects look promising. As more developers build on the platform and adoption increases, ICP token demand will likely rise. Does Internet Computer coin have a future? How much will Internet Computer coin cost in 2025? Will ICP reach $1000? Let’s get into the current price analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Internet Computer Token ICP Price $4.88 Market Cap $2.62B Trading Volume $60.24M Circulating Supply 537.51M ICP All-time High $750.73 (May 10, 2021) All-time Low $2.86 (Sep 2023) 24-h High $4.95 24-h Low $4.80 Internet Computer Network technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day period) 6.08% 14-Day RSI 42.43 50-Day SMA $5.29 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 51 (Neutral) Green Days 12/30 (40%) 200-Day SMA $5.42 Internet Computer price analysis TL;DR Breakdown ICP shows a slight recovery on the daily chart, but remains below the moving average. The $4.96 resistance level is critical to ICP’s upside or breakdown. Internet Computer (ICP) coin must hold the $4.82 support to keep the current structure intact. ICP 1-day price analysis As seen on the ICP daily chart for September 9, the coin is hovering around $4.88, struggling just below the mid-Bollinger Band at $4.96. The MACD histogram has just turned positive after a long bearish stretch, hinting at an early momentum shift. ICPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView However, until a daily close clears $4.96 convincingly, upside remains capped, with the next resistance at $5.42. On the downside, $4.50 serves as the nearest support, and a break below it risks dragging the price back toward $4.30. ICP 4-hour price analysis The 4-hour chart shows ICP recently spiking toward $4.96 but facing rejection, now consolidating above the $4.82–$4.85 zone where short-term moving averages (Alligator) are clustered. ICPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The RSI sits near 55, meaning the coin is neither overbought nor oversold. Additionally, the OBV remains negative, suggesting buying pressure is still fragile. If the support at $4.82 holds, another test of $4.96 is likely. If the bears override the $4.82 level, ICP could slip to $4.75 or lower. ICP technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $4.82 BUY SMA 5 $4.86 BUY SMA 10 $4.91 SELL SMA 21 $5.06 SELL SMA 50 $5.29 SELL SMA 100 $5.24 SELL SMA 200 $5.42 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $4.81 BUY EMA 5 $4.86 BUY EMA 10 $4.97 SELL EMA 21 $5.11 SELL EMA 50 $5.23 SELL EMA 100 $5.35 SELL EMA 200 $5.90 SELL What to expect from ICP price analysis ICP needs a daily close above $4.96 to unlock upside toward $5.42. Until then, traders can expect choppy range-bound moves with the $4.82–$4.50 price region as key support zones. Is Internet Computer a good investment? The Internet Computer (ICP) has shown significant potential and volatility since its launch, which is common for relatively new and ambitious blockchain projects.

Its designated liquidator, Teneo, has just executed another crucial move: substantial WLD sales . This action continues their ongoing, meticulous effort to recover assets for creditors, providing a glimpse into the complex process of unwinding a major crypto insolvency. What’s the Latest on These Crucial WLD Sales ? According to a recent report from blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain, a wallet associated with Teneo sold an additional 2.25 million WLD tokens. This transaction, valued at approximately $2.88 million, occurred roughly 14 hours ago. It represents another step in Teneo’s systematic liquidation strategy. These WLD sales are not a new development. The wallet first began offloading these tokens in July of last year. This followed an initial massive deposit of 75 million WLD two years ago, establishing a significant holding for the liquidator. Currently, the associated wallet still retains a substantial 52.47 million WLD, which is worth an impressive $92 million. This ongoing, controlled approach to WLD sales highlights the strategic considerations involved in managing such a large asset portfolio during bankruptcy proceedings. Why Are Teneo’s WLD Sales So Important for 3AC Creditors? The primary objective of any liquidation process is to maximize the recovery of assets for those who suffered losses. Teneo’s role, as the designated liquidator, is to systematically convert various crypto assets, including WLD, into funds that can be distributed to 3AC’s creditors. This is a vital step towards financial restitution. Strategic Offloading: Teneo avoids a sudden, large-scale dump of tokens, which could severely destabilize the market and depress the asset’s value. Instead, their strategy involves measured WLD sales over time. This careful approach aims to minimize negative price impact while steadily generating necessary funds. Transparency and Trust: Each reported instance of WLD sales offers a degree of transparency into the liquidation’s progress. This openness helps to build and maintain trust among creditors and the broader crypto community, demonstrating that the process is moving forward responsibly. The challenge for Teneo lies in balancing the urgent need for asset recovery with the imperative of market stability. What Can We Expect Regarding Future WLD Sales ? Given that Teneo still holds over 52 million WLD tokens, future WLD sales are highly probable. It is reasonable to anticipate that Teneo will continue its careful, phased approach, meticulously planning each transaction to optimize returns and mitigate market risks. Potential Market Impact: While individual WLD sales may appear small in isolation, their cumulative effect over time could certainly influence the token’s price dynamics. Both investors and market analysts will undoubtedly monitor these transactions closely, looking for any shifts in strategy or significant patterns. The ultimate goal for Teneo remains the comprehensive resolution of 3AC’s complex bankruptcy. These ongoing asset liquidations, including the recent WLD sales , are critical milestones on that long road to recovery for all affected parties. The ongoing WLD sales by Teneo serve as a stark reminder of the complexities inherent in large-scale crypto insolvencies. These actions, though seemingly routine in their execution, are absolutely crucial steps towards achieving justice and recovery for 3AC’s creditors. They powerfully underscore the importance of establishing robust and transparent liquidation frameworks within the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape, ensuring greater confidence and stability for the future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Who is Teneo? Teneo is the designated liquidator appointed to manage the assets and liabilities of Three Arrows Capital (3AC), the bankrupt crypto hedge fund. Their primary role is to recover and distribute assets to creditors. 2. What is WLD? WLD refers to the Worldcoin (WLD) token, which is a cryptocurrency distributed by Tools for Humanity, the company behind the Worldcoin project. It aims to create a global identity and financial network. 3. Why is Teneo selling WLD? Teneo is selling WLD tokens as part of its mandate to liquidate 3AC’s assets. The funds generated from these WLD sales are used to repay the creditors of the bankrupt hedge fund, as required by law. 4. How much WLD does Teneo still hold? As of the latest reports, the wallet associated with Teneo still holds approximately 52.47 million WLD tokens, valued at around $92 million. 5. What impact do these WLD sales have on the market? Teneo aims to conduct these WLD sales strategically and gradually to minimize negative market impact. However, the continuous offloading of a significant amount of any token can still create selling pressure and influence its price dynamics over time.

In a press release on Monday, CoinShares announced its plan, which will see the company listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market. This marks a key step in the firm’s expansion for US investors, following key regulatory breakthroughs in the country for digital assets. CoinShares’ Expansion Into American Markets The merger, formalized through a definitive business combination agreement, values CoinShares at approximately $1.2 billion on a pro-forma basis, positioning the company among the largest publicly traded digital asset managers . This transaction is expected to accelerate CoinShares’ international growth, particularly in the US market, which is increasingly recognized as a key hub for digital assets under President Donald Trump’s administration. Jean-Marie Mognetti, CEO and Co-Founder of CoinShares stated that the move is not merely a change of listing venue from Sweden to the United States but a significant step toward achieving global leadership in the digital asset space. By establishing a presence in the US, CoinShares aims to meet the rising demand from investors and leverage its experience to introduce a new suite of products tailored for American clients. Mognetti concluded by stating: Our European playbook, built and refined over a decade, is proven and effective. We are now deploying this experience to bring a new suite of products to American investors. A US listing will reinforce our credibility, expand our reach, and position us to capture the opportunity in the world’s largest asset management market, home to over half of global assets under management. Countdown To Q4 End CoinShares has established itself as a key player in the digital asset management space, currently ranking as the fourth-largest manager of digital asset exchange-traded products (ETPs) globally. With around $10 billion in assets under management (AuM) — a figure that has tripled over the past two years — the company boasts a product offering that has expanded from four products in 2021 to a suite of 32 across various platforms. The company’s operating model is designed for scalability, featuring a diverse array of products such as crypto ETPs for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana SOL), alongside equity products targeting the broader digital asset ecosystem. Both CoinShares and Vine Hill’s boards of directors have unanimously approved the business combination, which is anticipated to close by the end of the fourth quarter of 2025, pending shareholder and regulatory approvals.

Related Reading: Cardano Pushes Past $0.85: Falling Wedge Breakout Confirmed? The “Realized Cap” here refers to an indicator that basically measures the amount of capital that the investors of the cryptocurrency have put into it. As such, changes in the metric correspond to the exit or entry of capital into the network. In the context of the current topic, the Realized Cap of the whole market isn’t of interest, but rather that of a few specific investor segments. These are the holders with 5 to 7 years old, 7 to 10 years old and 10+ years old tokens. Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell them in the future, so these groups with their extremely long holding times would correspond to some of the most resolute hands in the sector. What the behavior of these investors is like, therefore, can be something to watch for. Below is a chart showing the trend in the Realized Cap for these Bitcoin groups. As displayed in the above graph, the Realized Cap associated with the youngest of these groups, the addresses holding coins aged between 5 and 7 years old, has seen a steep drop over the past year. The metric started out the window at a level of $14.9 billion, but today, it stands at just $8.5 billion, reflecting a decline of almost 43%. Investor groups classified based on age lose Realized Cap when they break their dormancy and participate in transactions. For example, as soon as a holder part of the 5 to 7 years old segment shifts their coins, the age of said tokens resets back to zero, and they along with their Realized Cap share get kicked out of the group. There’s one more way for the metric to decline for a cohort, however: upward promotion. This happens when an investor HODLs past the upper bound of the group’s age range. From the chart, it’s visible that the combined Realized Cap associated with the 5 to 7 years, 7 to 10 years, and 10+ years segments has actually gone up over the past year, despite the first of them noting a steep drop in its metric. Since capital can’t directly transfer to the latter two groups, it must have gone through the former.

As Glassnode has pointed out, though, this doesn’t mean that the cohort hasn’t participated in any real selling at all. “The 5–7y group still spent ~385k $BTC in profit over the year, showing that while most coins matured passively, some holders selectively distributed,” notes the analytics firm. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $112,400, up 3% over the past week.

In a recent post, Bale stated that “XRP will have a monumental moment when listed companies will buy XRP and shift from Bitcoin. This will happen when Spot ETFs start getting approved. It’s inevitable.” The comment reflects an expectation that institutional players could move away from Bitcoin dominance once additional investment vehicles are made available. GM XRP Holders. XRP will have a monumental moment when listed companies will buy XRP and shift from Bitcoin. This will happen when Spot ETFs start getting approved. It’s inevitable. — BALE (@AltcoinBale) September 7, 2025 Community Reactions to the Prediction The post attracted comments from other X users who echoed Bale’s outlook. Leonie, responding to the statement, wrote that the prediction was accurate, explaining that institutional money could shift once spot ETFs receive approval . According to her, XRP could become a preferred option for listed companies looking to diversify their crypto holdings away from Bitcoin. Another user, Just Jerryl, added that spot ETF approval could serve as a strong catalyst for XRP. He noted that such a development has the potential to drive significant market activity, describing it as an opportunity with “huge potential.” Growing Conviction on XRP ETF Approval Recent data from prediction markets supports the optimism expressed by Bale and others. According to a report from Times Tabloid, blockchain-based prediction platform Polymarket currently assigns a 94% probability that an XRP spot ETF will be approved in the United States before the end of 2025. The platform’s odds highlight a substantial increase in confidence compared to the beginning of the year, when expectations for approval remained in the low double digits. This surge in probability illustrates the shift in market sentiment throughout 2025. In the earlier part of the year, skepticism persisted about whether the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would authorize such products. However, the steady climb from lower odds into the 70%–90% range reflects changing perceptions, which now stand at near certainty according to Polymarket. The rising conviction on an XRP ETF is tied to broader developments in the digital asset sector. Approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs has contributed to greater confidence that additional cryptocurrencies will receive similar treatment. This trend has not only opened the door to mainstream investment products but also increased speculation that XRP could be among the next digital assets to gain approval.

The rising market odds for ETF approval reinforce the notion that such a development may not be far off. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.
