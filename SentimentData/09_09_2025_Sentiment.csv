Optimism price prediction for 2028 suggests the token could reach a maximum value of $11.14. In 2031, OP tokens will range between $27.9 and $33.66, with an average value of $28.88. Optimism’s (OP) commitment to innovation is highlighted by its support for Layer-3 solutions. These solutions enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Layer-2 chains, contributing to the expansive Optimism Superchain. The platform’s initiatives, including introducing custom gas tokens and Plasma mode aimed at reducing onboarding and operational costs, make it more accessible for new users and developers. As the market closely watches the price movements and growth trajectory of the token, can Optimism reach $10 soon? Let’s get into the OP price prediction for 2025 – 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Optimism Token OP Price $0.7528 Market Cap $1.33B Trading Volume $172.64M Circulating Supply 1.778B OP All-time High $4.85 (Mar 06, 2024) All-time Low $0.4005 (Jun 18, 2022) 24-hour High $0.7571 24-hour Low $0.7172 Optimism price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 4.98% 50-Day SMA $0.7228 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 51 (Neutral) Green Days 15/30 (50%) 200-Day SMA $0.7521 Optimism price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: OP could be testing a key breakout level soon. Momentum is shifting in favor of buyers. Optimism 1-day price chart Today’s candle surged to $0.7513, breaking above the mid-Bollinger Band at $0.7216 and closing near session highs. This move follows weeks of sideways action, suggesting a potential trend shift. OPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD histogram just flipped green while lines are crossing upward, reinforcing bullish momentum. The next major test is the upper Bollinger Band at $0.791, while support now sits around $0.721. A daily close back below $0.720 would weaken this breakout attempt, but holding current levels keeps $0.791 in sight. Optimism 4-hour price chart The 4-hour shows a sharp rally with volume expansion, pushing directly into $0.750 resistance. Immediate support lies at $0.732 and the 21-SMA at $0.722. If price consolidates above $0.732, continuation toward $0.770–$0.791 is likely. However, rejection here could trigger a pullback to retest $0.710 or $0.697 as demand zones. OPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView Optimism technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.7157 BUY SMA 5 $0.7121 BUY SMA 10 $0.7221 BUY SMA 21 $0.7252 BUY SMA 50 $0.7228 BUY SMA 100 $0.6665 BUY SMA 200 $0.7521 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.7000 BUY EMA 5 $0.7028 BUY EMA 10 $0.7116 BUY EMA 21 $0.7204 BUY EMA 50 $0.7107 BUY EMA 100 $0.7198 BUY EMA 200 $0.8603 SELL What to expect from Optimism? OP is at a breakout zone. Holding above $0.732 keeps momentum toward $0.791, while rejection at $0.750 risks a pullback into the $0.710–$0.722 demand area before bulls try again. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it’s risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you’re willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will Optimism reach $10? Yes, Optimism is projected to close up to $10 by 2028. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

Optimism historic price sentiment Optimism price history by Coingecko OP launched with an initial value of $4.57 on May 31 but dropped sharply in June due to the UST stablecoin de-pegging and LUNA collapse, closing June at $0.5434.

OP saw an eventful 2024, reaching an all-time high of $4.85 in March before sliding below $2.30 by mid-April. After a brief recovery to over $2.90 in May, it entered a bearish phase, trading at $1.82–$1.96 by July and $1.54–$1.62 by October. November brought a spark of hope with a peak at $2.60.

The market cap is $2.24 trillion, with a supply of 19.92 million BTC. Beyond price action, the backdrop for Bitcoin is being reshaped by three powerful forces: Nasdaq’s push into tokenized stocks, growing institutional accumulation, and a tightening technical structure that hints at an imminent breakout. Nasdaq has officially filed with the SEC to allow trading of tokenized U.S. equities, a landmark step in merging blockchain with traditional markets. The proposal would allow investors to choose between conventional stock trades and blockchain-backed tokens flagged at settlement. It's official. @Nasdaq filed with @SECGov to enable tokenized securities trading, a historic move by a U.S. traditional exchange.

At the same time, institutions and sovereign players continue to accumulate Bitcoin. Japanese firm Metaplanet added 136 BTC this week, raising its holdings to more than 20,000 BTC (over $2 billion).

And Michael Saylor’s Strategy acquired another 1,955 BTC, worth about $217 million, bringing its total stash to 638,460 BTC, cementing its position as the largest corporate holder worldwide. These combined moves signal that Bitcoin is not only being adopted at the financial infrastructure level but is also being increasingly absorbed by long-term holders, thereby reducing the available supply. MICHAEL SAYLOR JUST BOUGHT $217M $BTC AT $111,196 STRATEGY CURRENTLY HOLDS $71.58 BILLION OF BITCOIN AVERAGE PRICE: $73,880 pic.twitter.com/8X0G6RQ0py — Arkham (@arkham) September 8, 2025 What These Moves Mean for Bitcoin The implications of these events extend far beyond the headlines. Nasdaq’s tokenization leap could accelerate institutional adoption, providing new legitimacy for blockchain-based settlement and giving Bitcoin indirect exposure through increased trust in the ecosystem. Sovereign and corporate purchases underscore a growing conviction that Bitcoin can serve as a hedge against economic fragility and fiat currency devaluation, Metaplanet’s goal of reaching 210,000 BTC by 2027 underlines this strategic shift. Constrained supply —with more than 19.9 million BTC mined and fewer than 1.1 million left to be issued—means that institutional buying directly amplifies scarcity pressures. Together, these drivers create a foundation for Bitcoin to extend its gains higher, provided technical levels remain aligned. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Outlook: Triangle Breakout in Focus Bitcoin is consolidating in an ascending triangle, a bullish continuation pattern. Price is at $112,387, pressing against resistance at $113,400 and making higher lows since late August. The 50 SMA at $111,230 is support, while the 200 SMA at $112,777 is the immediate resistance. A sustained EMA crossover here would add fuel to the fire. Candlestick action has gone from indecision (Doji and spinning tops) to green closes, accumulation. The RSI at 62 remains firm but not overheated, suggesting upside room remains before momentum stretches. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview If Bitcoin breaks $113,400 with volume, the following upside targets sit at $115,400 and $117,150, levels highlighted by TradingView’s breakout path. Such a move would confirm that recent compression was the staging ground for renewed strength. Conversely, a failure to hold $111,500 risks a drop to $110,000 or $108,450; however, the rising trendline suggests that dips remain corrective rather than signs of reversal. For traders, a long entry above $113,400 presents an attractive setup, with stops placed below $111,200 to manage risk. A breakout could position Bitcoin for its next leg higher, potentially setting the stage for a push toward six-figure territory and even the $130,000 milestone in the coming cycle.

Related Reading: Why $50 XRP By December 2025 Isn’t ‘Hopium’ If ETFs Get Greenlight: Analyst According to reports, Lee says the market’s recent weakness is tied to the Federal Reserve’s reluctance to cut interest rates, while Schiff points to gold’s recent rally as a warning sign for Bitcoin. Schiff Points To Gold’s Rally In an X post, the gold bug Schiff highlighted that the yellow metal rose 10% over the last two months and reached a new high of $3,620. “Markets are forward-looking. That’s why gold is up 10% in advance of coming rate cuts,” he said, arguing that gold’s move shows traders expect easier policy ahead. Bitcoin, he added, has not followed gold’s lead, and that gap worries him. Permabull @fundstrat forecast Bitcoin will hit $200K by year-end, as Bitcoin is sensitive to Fed rate cuts. He said the Fed’s two-month pause is why Bitcoin hasn’t rallied over that time period. But gold rallied 10% during those two months, hitting a record $3,620 as he spoke. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) September 8, 2025 Lee’s $200,000 Call And His Explanation Tom Lee remains optimistic. He has argued that the influx of institutional investors gives Bitcoin new “counter-cyclical characteristics,” and that bigger players could push prices much higher over time. Based on reports, Lee blames the recent underperformance on the Fed and keeps the $200,000 figure in public view. His stance continues to make him one of Wall Street’s best-known permabulls – persons who maintain a perpetually optimistic outlook. Market Odds And Traders’ View Polymarket users appear unconvinced by Lee’s timetable. At press time, markets show an 8% chance of Bitcoin reaching $200k this year. The same markets place roughly an 8% chance on Bitcoin dropping below $70,000 by the end of 2025. Those odds suggest bettors are split and that headline targets are being treated with skepticism. Source: Polymarket A Broader Performance Check Schiff has also pointed to longer-term measurements. He noted that Bitcoin is down 16% against gold over the past four years, even though the cryptocurrency has posted strong gains versus the US dollar in that span. He warned that when “more air” comes out of the Bitcoin bubble, the four-year returns may look weak. The idea that the old four-year cycle tied to halvings may be fading was raised by other analysts in recent commentary, and that debate is ongoing. Related Reading: Tighter Premiums Put Crypto Treasuries On Risky Road, According To NYDIG What Comes Next For Bitcoin Schiff went further by saying Bitcoin is more likely to sink below $100k than to reach $200k, putting a cautious spin on the outlook. This view makes clear where Schiff stands: he treats gold’s rally as a forward signal about future policy and believes Bitcoin’s lag is not a short-term quirk but a structural concern. Lee’s counter is that institutional flows could change how Bitcoin moves over time.

Government Figures Show 21 BTC Were Added According to President Nayib Bukele and the country’s Bitcoin Office, the government bought 21 BTC on Sunday as a symbolic nod to Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap. Reports show the state has continued buying one BTC per day. The buying has been carried out since March 2024. Based on government figures and blockchain data, El Salvador now holds 6,313 BTC. The holdings are valued at about $700 million at current prices. Small in daily budget terms, these moves carry big political weight. Buying 21 bitcoin for Bitcoin Day. pic.twitter.com/3X4yKeiqzg — Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) September 7, 2025 Clash With IMF Loan Terms Reports have disclosed that the purchases confound a $1.4 billion IMF loan agreement signed in December last year. The deal required public entities to halt voluntary accumulation of Bitcoin and called for a freeze on further acquisitions under the finalized Extended Fund Facility. As part of the agreement, the government revised the Bitcoin Law so merchant acceptance is voluntary, agreed to liquidate the Fidebitcoin trust, and planned an exit from the Chivo wallet program. Yet purchases have continued. That has left IMF officials and outside observers watching whether future disbursements will be granted, since compliance reviews are scheduled through 2027. IMF Estimates And The Question Of Disclosure Based on an IMF report from March, the fund estimates El Salvador spent roughly $300 million on Bitcoin since 2021. At current market levels, those purchases represent more than $400 million in unrealized gains. But the IMF also noted that limited disclosure around transactions and holdings makes a full independent assessment difficult. Government disclosure of Bitcoin activity remains incomplete, even with public dashboards now in place. Reports have noted that unrealized gains could be affected if market prices decline. On Bitcoin, Security Moves And Public Transparency Late last month, the National Bitcoin Office redistributed holdings across multiple addresses, placing a cap of roughly 500 BTC per address. Officials said the change was motivated by concerns about future quantum computing threats . The new addresses were published on a public dashboard, a move intended to boost clarity over custody. Some market and industry observers welcome the dashboard. Others say the quantum argument sounds precautionary and that clearer audit standards are still needed. Bold But Divisive Four years after adopting Bitcoin as legal tender, El Salvador’s approach is still splitting opinion. Supporters say the country has built strong gains and stayed committed to its plan, while critics warn it has created problems with international lenders. The anniversary shows that El Salvador’s Bitcoin push is still seen by many as bold, but also deeply disputed.

This month, three projects stand out for their unique narratives and market strategies: BullZilla ($BZIL) , Dogwifhat, and Pudgy Penguins. Each one brings something different to the table, from explosive ROI potential to steady technical setups and powerful brand expansion. For financial students, analysts, and crypto enthusiasts, identifying the best meme coin presales in September 2025 is not just about chasing hype, it’s about understanding the mechanics that drive long-term growth. As this article explores BullZilla’s presale, Dogwifhat’s resilience, and Pudgy Penguins’ ecosystem, it becomes clear why these tokens belong to the best meme coin presales in September 2025 list. BullZilla — Forged on Ethereum, Fuelled by the HODL Furnace BullZilla presale currently rides at stage “Dead Wallets Don’t Lie.” This is the first phase of its launch on Ethereum. It trades at $0.00003241. So far, the presale has raised over $257k, with 900+ token holders already onboard. The returns are staggering: earliest participants saw 463 % ROI up until stage 2A. From stage 2A to listing, the current ROI is 16,164× (1,616,400 %) based on a projected listing price of $0.0052. BullZilla is built atop Ethereum, drawing on its security, liquidity, and DeFi ecosystem. This “forged in Ethereum’s blue fire” framework supports BullZilla’s standout feature: the HODL Furnace. This staking system encourages long-term commitment by offering a 70 % APY for locking $BZIL tokens. It works to convert “paper hands” into “diamond claws.” As rewards grow over time through vesting, committed holders earn increasing benefits. Investment Scenario An investment scenario: $2,500 placed at the presale price of $0.00003241 buys roughly 77 million $BZIL tokens. With a listing price of $0.0052, that stake could become worth about $400,400, a potential gain of nearly 160×. The powerful incentive to stake in the HODL Furnace means holders earn yield while possibly watching their holdings multiply. These design elements, Ethereum backbone, 70 % APY, vesting rewards, referral systems, tie Bull Zilla into mainstream DeFi and community growth. The presale mechanics, with dynamic scarcity and structured phases, dramatize potential explosive ROI while anchoring the project in security. Dogwifhat — Steady Consolidation, Poised for a Break Dogwifhat (WIF) trades in a tight range between $0.80 and $0.83, showing resilience as buyers defend $0.80 while resistance builds at $0.83. Intraday swings are shrinking, suggesting the token is consolidating before its next directional move. Technical indicators, like RSI near 46, point to neutral momentum. MACD histogram turning positive, whale buying, and growing liquidity support a cautious rebound setup. If $0.80 holds, WIF could rise toward $0.90–$1.00. But a breakdown risks deeper losses. Another outlook projects a strong rally: breaking above $0.94 could open the path to $2.50–$3.00 within weeks, implying a potential 200–266 % gain from its current level. Dogwifhat’s profile now blends stability and momentum. Its top-150 market cap and near-billion-token supply hint at institutional traction. The balance between supply and demand could set up a breakout if key resistance breaks. Pudgy Penguins — From NFTs to Brand Power & Market Might Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) stands out for its transformation from an NFT icon to a $1.9–$2.0 billion meme coin token, priced around $0.03. Analysts see technical patterns like cup-and-handle, wedge breakouts, and whale accumulation, suggesting gains toward $0.04–$0.06. Its expansion spans merchandise, IP development, animated series, toy licensing, and token utility on the Solana-based Abstract network. The Canary PENGU ETF proposal, holding mostly PENGU tokens and NFTs, signals institutional interest. Analysts highlight its deflationary and scarcity model, blended with brand loyalty and community engagement. One report underscores how Pudgy Penguins, XRPs, and BullZilla illustrate paths toward 100× gains. PENGU leverages storytelling and token burn mechanics; BullZilla combines presale engineering, staking, and DeFi pathways. Conclusion September’s crypto landscape is filled with noise, but separating signal from hype highlights the best meme coin presales in September 2025. BullZilla stands out with its Ethereum foundation and high-yield HODL Furnace, while Dogwifhat demonstrates disciplined consolidation with breakout potential, and Pudgy Penguins leverages brand loyalty for mainstream adoption. Together, they capture the spirit of meme coin evolution, blending innovation with risk. For those studying the market, tracking the best meme coin presales in September 2025 offers both a window into short-term strategies and lessons in long-term resilience. Whether through DeFi staking, technical analysis, or brand expansion, these tokens reflect why investors worldwide keep returning to the best meme coin presales in September 2025 for opportunities that can define portfolios. For More Information: BZIL Official Website Join BZIL Telegram Channel Follow BZIL on X (Formerly Twitter) Frequently Asked Questions for BullZilla Presale What is the HODL Furnace in BullZilla? It’s a staking mechanism on Ethereum where users lock $BZIL tokens to earn 70 % APY. The longer they stay staked, the more they earn through vesting. How realistic is the ROI figure for BullZilla stage-2A investors? Early investors saw around 463 % ROI up to stage 2A. From there to listing, the theoretical ROI is 16,164× if the listing price hits $0.0052. This assumes successful listing and market interest. Why might Dogwifhat rally significantly? Its tight consolidation between $0.80–$0.83, neutral RSI, and rising MACD suggest momentum is building. If resistance is broken, some forecasts project gains beyond $2.50. What drives Pudgy Penguins’ value? PENGU’s value stems from its NFT heritage, new token utility on Solana, brand licensing, animated media, and potential ETF inclusion—all supported by technical chart setups. Are these investments low risk? All involve market volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and speculative elements. This article is purely informational.

As a result, some key staff will leave the British auction house, according to sources close to the developments, casting doubt on the future of its on-chain initiatives. Christie’s will continue in the digital art sector The restructuring exercise has reportedly seen two employees let go at the end of last month. These include the department’s vice president of Digital Art, Nicole Sales Giles, who confirmed the news to Now Media. A spokesperson for Christie’s revealed in an official statement that the move was more of a strategic realignment as opposed to a total withdrawal from the space. “Christie’s has made a strategic decision to reformat digital art sales,” the spokesperson told Now Media. “The company will continue to sell digital art within the larger 20 th and 21 st Century Art category.” Christie’s spokesperson. The move reportedly marks a sharp reversal from the auction house’ stance just a few years ago. The auction house in March 2021 ignited an NFT bull run with a record shattering $69 million sale of digital art work – “Everydays: The First 5000 Days” by the artist Beeple. The sale was reportedly credited with legitimizing NFT and position traditional art institutions as key players in the nascent digital market. This also comes as part of wide-spread changes under the auction house’s new chief executive officer Bonnie Brennan, who took over as CEO in February this year. Dissolving the department has raised questions about the future of the auction house’s dedicated on-chain auction platform known as 3.0, which was launched in September 2022. The auction platform was a flagship of a project that the digital art team, which had also fronted exhibitions and partnerships among them “Getway” events with Now Media during Art Basel Miami and Frieze Seoul. The decision comes amid a challenging time for the digital art sector Christie’s strategic shift does not occur in isolation as it comes at a tough time for the digital art sector, which has seen platforms like MakersPlace, KnownOrigin, and Async Art shut down over the past two years amid a cooling market. For Christie’s, the rise in AI in art creation has also created problems for the auction house as the battle between artists and AI companies continue to intensify. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan, the auction house was in the middle of a storm in February when thousands of artists came together to stop the renowned auction house from sale of AI generated art arguing this was “mass theft” of human creativity. This was not the first nor last case, reflecting conflict over the use of AI technology in the art and entertainment industry with artists complaining over various issues like copyright infringement. One of the prominent cases involved a group of artists that took Meta to court in 2023 over allegations that the social media giant was misusing their books to train AI models, particularly Llama, which powers its chatbots. While the auction house is expected to continue to offer digital works, folding them into its broader contemporary art sales signals a move away from the standalone and specialized focus that defined the market’s peak.

The South Korean media outlet MoneyS reported that Tether officials are in the country to attend a domestic blockchain conference. But the executives are also reportedly planning meetings with a range of domestic fintech companies, including the neobank Toss. The headquarters of Shinhan Bank in central Seoul, South Korea. Tether officials met senior Shinhan executives at the building in the morning of September 8, with stablecoins on the agenda. (Source: Mobius6 [CC BY-SA 4.0]) Tether, Korean Banks Hold Stablecoin Talks The media outlet wrote that several Tether executives attended the Shinhan meeting, including Vice President Marco Dal Lago, the firm’s head of Global Expansions and Strategic Partnerships. Quynh Le, Tethers’ Regional Expansion Lead in the APAC area, and Andres Kim, the firm’s Bolivia-based Expansion Manager, were also in attendance. The summit is Shinhan Financial Group Chairman Jin Ok-dong’s second meeting with a major US stablecoin issuer in the space of a month. Jin and several rival South Korean bank heads met Heath Tarbert, the head of the USD Coin issuer Circle, during the latter’s visit to Seoul late last month . A Shinhan Financial Group official told media representatives that Shinhan and Tether “plan to continue discussing ways to build mutual networks.” South Korean lawmakers continue to push forward with plans to regulate KRW-pegged stablecoins. Evidently sensing an opportunity, both Tether and Circle have recently sent delegations to Seoul. Cho Young-seo, the Vice President of KB Kookmin Bank, is also set to meet Tether representatives on September 10. KEB Hana Financial Group and Woori Financial Group officials have already spoken to Tether officials about stablecoins. The parties held meetings on August 26.

MoneyS concluded that “global companies with established issuance and distribution networks” are likely to continue discussing collaboration options with domestic financial institutions until lawmakers come to an agreement. Allowing South Korean firms to issue stablecoins was a key manifesto pledge for President Lee Jae-myung ahead of June’s elections. Since Lee came to power, scores of major banks and leading IT firms have registered KRW-pegged stablecoin -related trademarks. These include the internet giants Kakao and Naver. Both of the firms operate widely used e-payment platforms. Experts believe stablecoin integration would be straightforward for both Kakao and Naver.

51416321,https://timestabloid.com/?p=82402,1757374259,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Beyond Wall Street: XRP’s Viable Paths in Remittances and Digital Economy,https://timestabloid.com/beyond-wall-street-xrps-viable-paths-in-remittances-and-digital-economy/,"When XRP entered the digital asset space more than a decade ago, its primary vision was to serve as a settlement rail for global banks, with the potential to replace or complement systems like SWIFT. Over time, however, major financial institutions have pursued other directions. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), proprietary payment networks, and internal settlement solutions have taken precedence, leaving XRP’s original “bank-focused” proposition in question. Critics often interpret this hesitation as a failure of XRP’s core mission. Yet, the assumption that XRP’s growth depends solely on Wall Street or large banks overlooks the broader landscape of opportunities. The asset’s utility extends beyond traditional finance and continues to expand across multiple industries. Retail Remittances as a Primary Driver One of XRP’s strongest applications lies in the global remittance sector. Millions of migrant workers regularly send money home to countries such as the Philippines, Mexico, Nigeria, and India. Traditional banking methods for these transfers are slow, expensive, and inaccessible to many. XRP offers faster settlements with significantly reduced costs, directly improving the lives of recipients. Practical examples already exist. In 2023, freelance platform goLance revealed that it uses XRP to pay workers in underserved markets. According to its CEO, Michael Brooks, delays and high charges imposed by traditional banks are unsustainable, especially for freelancers earning modest incomes. By adopting RippleNet and the XRP Ledger, goLance can transfer funds instantly, including during weekends, and at minimal cost. Considering that the global remittance industry is valued at approximately $860 billion annually, XRP’s role as a cost-effective bridge currency for individuals could represent one of its most sustainable avenues of adoption. Small Businesses and Corporate Payments Beyond individuals, small and medium-sized enterprises also face challenges with international transactions. Companies that depend on overseas suppliers or manage payroll for global workforces often require faster, cheaper alternatives to the conventional banking system. XRP’s ability to act as an intermediary currency for cross-border payments makes it a practical solution in these contexts. Japan’s SBI Holdings demonstrated this potential in 2023 by rolling out an XRP-powered remittance service targeting countries such as Vietnam, the Philippines, and Indonesia. Through this system, funds are transmitted in XRP and then converted into the recipient’s local currency, enabling efficient, low-cost transfers across Asia. XRP’s relevance also extends into the growing internet economy. Activities such as streaming payments, gaming transactions, and machine-to-machine transfers in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment benefit from a payment network that is both inexpensive and highly scalable. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 While stablecoins and Bitcoin’s Lightning Network have drawn early adoption in this area, XRP’s low fees and transaction speed position it as a viable competitor. Another source of strength for XRP lies in the development of the XRP Ledger (XRPL) . The ledger supports decentralized exchanges, automated market makers, tokenized assets, and compliance-oriented non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The presence of stablecoins within the XRPL ecosystem further reinforces the role of XRP as a native bridge asset, supporting liquidity and reducing transaction friction. A Diversification Asset in a CBDC-Dominated Future XRP may also serve as a diversification tool for investors in the future. Because a portion of XRP is permanently removed from circulation through transaction fees, its supply decreases gradually over time. This built-in scarcity could position it as a hedge in a global financial environment dominated by government-backed digital currencies, without requiring it to displace major currencies. The notion that XRP’s success depends exclusively on large banks no longer reflects its trajectory. While it may not fulfill its original vision of being the universal settlement rail for financial institutions, XRP’s relevance is reinforced by other applications—remittances, small business transactions, digital economy payments, ecosystem development, and investment diversification. Each of these areas individually may appear modest compared to the scale of global banking, but collectively they provide a diversified foundation for XRP’s continued growth. Even without full support from Wall Street, XRP retains multiple viable paths to long-term utility and adoption.

The chip giant, a foundational pillar of modern computing, is undergoing a significant transformation at its highest levels. This isn’t just a corporate reshuffle; it’s a strategic realignment under CEO Lip-Bu Tan, poised to redefine Intel’s future and its competitive edge in the global tech arena. Intel Leadership Undergoes a Strategic Overhaul: What’s Driving Tan’s Vision? Since Lip-Bu Tan took the helm as CEO in March, Intel has been charting a new course, marked by bold strategic moves and significant Intel leadership changes. The latest announcement signals a pivotal moment for the company, with Michelle Johnston Holthaus, formerly Chief Executive Officer of Intel Products, departing after over three decades. While she will remain a strategic adviser, her departure paves the way for a fresh wave of talent and a redefined organizational structure. This transition underscores Tan’s commitment to agile leadership and a renewed focus on innovation and execution. These shifts are not isolated incidents but part of a broader strategy to streamline operations and enhance Intel’s responsiveness to market demands. The company is clearly signaling a move towards a more specialized and customer-centric approach, aiming to accelerate product development cycles and reinforce its market position against intense competition. The Future is Fabricated: How Custom Silicon is Reshaping Intel’s Strategy One of the most exciting and forward-looking developments is the creation of a new central engineering group, specifically tasked with building a custom silicon business for external clients. This move represents Intel’s ambition to expand its reach beyond its traditional product lines, offering tailored solutions to a diverse customer base. This strategic pivot towards bespoke chip design and manufacturing is critical in an era where specialized chips are becoming increasingly vital for everything from advanced AI accelerators to high-performance computing and niche enterprise solutions. Heading this new group is Srinivasan ‘Srini’ Iyengar, a seasoned expert who joined Intel from Cadence Design Systems in July. His extensive expertise in chip design and verification will be instrumental in positioning Intel as a formidable player in bespoke silicon, directly competing with established foundry services and capitalizing on the burgeoning demand for highly optimized hardware solutions across various industries. New Faces, New Ambitions: Intel’s Play in the Evolving Semiconductor Industry Beyond internal transitions, Intel is injecting new blood into its senior ranks, bringing in top talent from across the competitive semiconductor industry . Kevork Kechichian, formerly of ARM, has joined as the head of Intel’s data center group, a crucial segment for cloud computing, enterprise solutions, and the foundational infrastructure that powers much of the digital economy. Jim Johnson has been appointed Senior Vice President and General Manager of Intel’s client computing group, overseeing the company’s core PC business, which remains a significant revenue driver. Furthermore, Naga Chandrasekaran, Chief Technology and Operations Officer of Intel Foundry, is taking on an expanded role, reinforcing the company’s commitment to its business unit that builds custom chips for outside customers. These strategic hires, combined with the new organizational structure, aim to accelerate product development, foster innovation, and strengthen Intel’s position against fierce competition, ensuring it remains at the forefront of technological advancement and market leadership. Beyond the Core: The Impact on AI Chips and High-Performance Computing The emphasis on custom silicon and the influx of specialized talent have significant implications for the future of AI chips . As artificial intelligence continues to permeate every industry, from healthcare to finance and autonomous systems, the demand for highly efficient, purpose-built AI accelerators is skyrocketing. Intel’s new central engineering group, with its focus on custom solutions, is perfectly positioned to cater to this need, designing chips optimized for specific AI workloads. This could enable significant breakthroughs in machine learning, deep learning, and edge AI, impacting everything from advanced data analytics to intelligent automation. For the broader technology ecosystem, including the infrastructure that supports cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies, Intel’s advancements in high-performance computing and AI indirectly support the underlying processing power and development of new innovations that rely on robust, efficient hardware. Steering the Giant: The Crucial Role of the Intel CEO in a Shifting Landscape The vision for these transformative changes is clearly being driven by Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan. His statement, “With Srini leading Central Engineering, we’re aligning innovation and execution more tightly in service to customers… We are laser-focused on delivering world-class products and empowering our engineering teams to move faster and execute with excellence,” highlights a clear strategy: customer-centric innovation and operational excellence. Tan’s leadership is not only about internal restructuring but also about navigating external pressures, such as the recent U.S. government plan to convert existing grants into a 10% stake in Intel. This deal was notably structured to penalize Intel if the company dropped below 50% ownership of its foundry unit, underscoring the strategic national importance of its manufacturing capabilities. These complex geopolitical and economic factors underscore the critical role of strong leadership in guiding Intel through a rapidly evolving and competitive global technology landscape, making Tan’s decisions paramount for the company’s future success. Intel’s recent leadership shake-up and strategic realignments signal a determined effort to reclaim its position at the vanguard of the technology world. By focusing on agile leadership, expanding its custom silicon capabilities, and bringing in top-tier talent, Intel under Lip-Bu Tan is poised for a significant transformation. These bold moves are critical for staying competitive in the rapidly evolving semiconductor industry and for meeting the escalating demands for advanced computing, particularly in the burgeoning fields of AI and high-performance computing. The coming years will reveal the full impact of these changes as Intel strives to build a ‘new Intel’ ready for the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century, solidifying its role as a key player in shaping the future of digital innovation.

51416683,https://timestabloid.com/?p=82399,1757374813,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Charts Don’t Lie: 3 Top Cryptos in September 2025 That Could Deliver High Upside Gains,https://timestabloid.com/charts-dont-lie-3-top-cryptos-in-september-2025-that-could-deliver/,"Every crypto cycle produces tokens that go from quiet whispers to center stage. In September 2025, analysts are pointing to three projects making waves: MoonBull, Brett, and Useless Coin. Each is attracting different kinds of attention, but all are on the radar for traders hunting big upside. What makes this list interesting? These aren’t random picks. Each of these meme coins has a unique hook, whether it’s the energy of a new launch, the community pull of a mascot, or the humor of a satire project. Let’s break down why these names are being counted among the top cryptos in September 2025. 1. MoonBull: Whitelist Energy That’s Hard to Ignore MoonBull ($MOBU) is bringing an unstoppable mix of bull momentum and meme energy to Ethereum. This isn’t just another meme coin floating on hype. It’s designed with exclusivity at its core. The whitelist is live now, and it’s where the real opportunity lies. Whitelist members get access to perks no one else will touch: Entry at the lowest possible price Secret staking rewards for those holding early Bonus token allocations that stack value Private hints on the roadmap, only for insiders These are strictly capped benefits. Once the whitelist closes, no second chances will appear, making MoonBull one of the most top cryptos in September 2025 for early movers. Why Scarcity Matters in MoonBull’s Case Here’s the deal: scarcity always fuels demand. When access is limited, the psychology of wanting in becomes even stronger. Traders have seen this movie before. A handful of past whitelist projects delivered massive upside within months simply because early access was reserved for the few who moved quickly. That’s what MoonBull is replicating. To secure a spot, traders need to drop an email into the whitelist form. Once approved, they’ll receive a private notification revealing the exact Stage One launch date before the public even knows. Bulls are already lining up. 2. Brett: The Base Community’s Mascot With Staying Power Brett, the ERC-20 token living on Coinbase’s Base layer-2, has become more than a meme. Inspired by the “Brett” character from Matt Furie’s Boys’ Club comic, it’s now the unofficial mascot of Base. That cultural anchor has given it a strong foundation with a community that thrives on identity and inside jokes. The token’s rise has been steady. Brett appeals to traders who enjoy the blend of nostalgia and new tech, a comic-based meme coin rooted in one of the fastest-growing ecosystems. Base itself is gaining traction, and Brett is positioned as its standout. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because Brett combines familiarity with fresh infrastructure. Its ability to rally a crowd around culture makes it one of the more top cryptos in September 2025 for those betting on community-driven growth. 3. Useless Coin: The Satirical Play That Keeps Gaining Attention On the other end of the spectrum sits Useless Coin. Built on Solana, this project does exactly what its name suggests – nothing. No roadmap, no governance, no utility. The satire is the point. It’s a critique of overhyped projects that promise the moon but never deliver. And strangely enough, that’s what’s making it valuable. The community embraces the irony, leaning into the absurdity of speculation itself. Traders see Useless Coin as a pure meme experience, thriving on culture, humor, and community banter rather than technical promises. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because it represents the raw speculative spirit that often drives meme markets. Its parody stance makes it one of the top cryptos in September 2025 worth watching, precisely because it refuses to play by the rules. Final Thoughts Based on the latest research, the top cryptos in September 2025 are MoonBull , Brett, and Useless Coin. Each has carved out its own lane: MoonBull with its exclusive whitelist perks, Brett with its mascot status on Base, and Useless Coin with its satire-driven speculation. For traders eyeing explosive upside, the common thread here is culture mixed with timing. From exclusivity to community strength to parody, these projects highlight how meme energy still drives crypto markets in unexpected ways.

Presales are usually announced on official project websites, crypto news outlets, or launchpad platforms. Always verify links and official sources before committing. What is the best crypto presale to invest in 2025? Analysts currently highlight MoonBull as one of the strongest presales of 2025 because of its whitelist access and limited supply. Which meme coin to buy right now? Traders are keeping close eyes on MoonBull for presale access, while Brett and Useless Coin are being watched for cultural and community-driven growth. Which meme coin will explode in 2025? There’s no guaranteed outcome, but MoonBull’s whitelist model, Brett’s Base community backing, and Useless Coin’s parody momentum make them strong contenders. Do meme coins have a future? Yes. Meme coins continue to thrive by blending culture, community, and humor. While speculative, they often lead new trends in crypto adoption and trader attention.

Especially intriguing is the buzz around Layer Brett , an innovative Layer 2 token currently undergoing a presale that’s capturing serious attention, quickly raising capital, and promising early adopters a unique blend of meme-fueled energy and undeniable blockchain utility. This isn’t just another flash in the pan; it’s a genuine contender. Layer Brett (LBRETT) is the best-looking crypto token for the future Layer Brett (LBRETT) is not merely another memecoin riding on a fleeting trend. This ERC-20 token is a next-generation Layer 2 beast built squarely on Ethereum, designed to fuse viral meme culture with tangible blockchain scalability. Think of it as Brett (original), but on steroids, with purpose. It’s an escape from the utility-free origins of its namesake, promising a robust ecosystem featuring high-yield staking rewards, seamless interoperability, and a truly community-driven roadmap. It aims to deliver real-world solutions without sacrificing the infectious energy of those memes. Layer Brett leverages cutting-edge Layer 2 technology to sidestep Ethereum’s notorious congestion. This means transactions happen off-chain, blazing fast, while still retaining the ironclad security and decentralization of the leading Ethereum network. It’s a game-changer. What does this mean for you? Blazing-Fast Transactions: Say goodbye to endless waiting times. Layer Brett offers near-instant settlements for everything from trading to staking. Ultra-Low Gas Fees: Tired of high fees eating into your gains? This Layer 2 solution slashes costs to mere pennies, making micro-transactions viable for everyone. Hyper-Incentivized Staking: Early buyers can stake their LBRETT tokens right away, locking in incredible APYs at 850%. That’s a serious passive income opportunity. Community-First Approach: Layer Brett isn’t just a technical marvel; it’s a movement. With a $1 million giveaway planned, it’s actively building a vibrant, engaged community from the ground up. Cardano (ADA) price prediction and Chainlink (LINK) market caps are already astronomical While Cardano (ADA) price prediction and Chainlink (LINK) have been hot topics for years, and they continue to be crucial players in the Web3 space, their growth trajectories often operate on different principles. Cardano, with its slow and steady development, aims to deliver institutional-grade DeFi solutions and smart contracts. Chainlink, the undisputed oracle king, powers decentralized data feeds across countless blockchains. Both are foundational, yes, but their market caps are already astronomical, for investors seeking the next big crypto, tokens like ADA offer distinct risk-reward profiles. They offer stability, but Layer Brett is geared for explosive early growth that more established assets simply cannot replicate. Layer Brett (LBRETT) is becoming the next 100x altcoin Now, about the price. When you compare Layer Brett ’s current presale price of $0.0055 to behemoths like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, or even Pepe, the potential for exponential growth is impossible to ignore. These established meme coin giants began small, often with little to no utility, before skyrocketing in value to the billions. Layer Brett, however, launches with a clear, tech-backed advantage: it’s a Layer 2 blockchain from day one. Analysts are whispering about Layer Brett becoming the next 100x altcoin, especially as it stands out against the purely speculative nature of Brett (original). The market for low-cap crypto gems is always ripe, and Layer Brett is poised to be a top gainer in the upcoming crypto bull run of 2025. Don’t let this best crypto presale slip through your fingers. Be part of the movement that truly defines the future of decentralized finance. Don’t miss this top meme coin opportunity.

On-chain flows show a $26M net outflow, hinting at accumulation despite fragile sentiment. Key levels: $4,200 as risk pivot, $4,500 as breakout trigger for bullish momentum. By Jainam Mehta Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) is holding steady around $4,314, attempting to stabilize after several weeks of rangebound movement. On the 4-hour chart, the token is pressing against the lower boundary of a descending triangle formation, with the $4,200–$4,250 zone acting as a firm support base. This level has been tested repeatedly without breaking, underscoring strong demand absorption. The Parabolic SAR remains above price action, reflecting ongoing pressure from sellers. Momentum, however, is neutralizing. The RSI hovers at 49, showing little conviction from either buyers or sellers. Analysts note that Ethereum is in a “wait-and-see” phase where rallies fade quickly and pullbacks are met with buying interest. ETH price dynamics (Source: TradingView) If ETH can clear the $4,450–$4,500 ceiling, the market could flip decisively bullish, with the potential to target $4,800. Conversely, a failure to defend $4,200 risks opening a move toward the $3,800–$3,900 liquidity pocket, which has historically served as a launchpad for recovery. On-chain flows and market tone Exchange flow data mirrors the cautious market structure. On September 8, Ethereum recorded a $26 million net outflow from exchanges, suggesting investors are moving tokens into cold storage. Such behavior often aligns with accumulation phases and price resilience. Still, opportunistic selling has emerged during recent dips, with inflows accompanying short-term declines. This duality reflects a fragile balance: long-term investors appear to be building positions, while shorter-term traders are quick to take profits. Market sentiment remains split. Intraday traders are watching the compression closely, while swing investors are focused on whether the $4,200 floor or $4,500 ceiling gives way first. Futures positioning has moderated after a strong summer, reinforcing the sense that Ethereum is preparing for a directional expansion. Outlook hinges on breakout levels Ethereum’s near-term trajectory is defined by two critical thresholds: $4,200 as the risk pivot and $4,500 as the breakout trigger. A decisive push above $4,500 could invite bullish momentum toward $4,800, while a breakdown risks pulling ETH toward the $3,800 pocket. In prior coverage, Ethereum was highlighted as coiling near $4,250, with traders awaiting clarity on flows and momentum. The latest stabilization above $4,300 shows resilience, but the token remains locked in a range where direction will depend on whether buyers or sellers seize control in the coming sessions.

According to on-chain data from CryptoQuant, this represents the largest whale distribution since July 2022, adding significant selling pressure to the market. The sell-off came from large holders controlling between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC. These whales had accumulated more than 270,000 BTC between April and August, only to reverse course and flood the market with supply. This aggressive profit-taking pushed Bitcoin prices below $109,000, marking a 5.5% monthly decline and breaking a four-month winning streak. Market Shows Signs of Bitcoin (BTC) Stabilization Despite the heavy distribution, recent activity suggests selling pressure may be cooling. Whale movements peaked on September 3, when more than 95,000 BTC changed hands in a single week, the largest shift since March 2021. However, the pace has since slowed to around 38,000 BTC per week as of September 6. Currently, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading in a narrow range between $111,700 and $112,000, signaling that some stability is returning. Analysts caution, however, that a looming “head and shoulders” pattern and an unfilled FVG at $114,000 could precede another sharp downturn. If this resistance zone triggers fresh selling, BTC could slide back toward $106,000, testing critical support levels. Institutional Buyers Take Advantage While whales have been reducing exposure, institutional investors appear to be absorbing some of the pressure. Corporate buyers and ETF inflows have provided what analysts call a “structural counterbalance” to whale dumping. For example, Japanese firm Metaplanet Inc. recently added 136 BTC to its treasury, bringing its total holdings to more than 20,000 BTC. Nick Ruck, Director at LVRG Research, notes that ETF-driven demand and corporate accumulation could stabilize Bitcoin even amid aggressive whale selling. However, the broader outlook remains tied to macroeconomic conditions, especially the Federal Reserve’s upcoming September 17 meeting, where interest rate decisions could significantly sway liquidity in risk markets. With Bitcoin still down about 11% from mid-August highs near $124,000, traders remain split: will institutional buying outweigh whale pressure, or is a deeper crash on the horizon?

Prices are swinging, new technologies are proving themselves in real time, and the search for the best crypto investments is at an all-time high. Certain projects are beginning to separate from the noise by showing adoption, liquidity, and relevance that extends beyond speculation. Rather than focusing on daily price pumps, this guide explores four names that are commanding attention: BlockDAG, Cardano, XRP, and Sui. Each represents a different strand of growth, whether it’s presale scale, regulatory clarity, or developer-driven adoption. Together, they highlight where the most promising opportunities lie in 2025. 1. BlockDAG: Nearly $400M Raised With Flat-Rate Presale Pricing BlockDAG is rewriting expectations around presales. With nearly $400 million raised and over 25.7 billion coins sold, it has already eclipsed the fundraising scale of many historical projects. At its Deployment Event in Singapore, BlockDAG introduced a flat-rate presale price of $0.0013 for the final 30 days before launch. This new model replaced confusing bonus tiers with a fair, transparent, and equal-access system, ensuring that every participant has the same opportunity to buy in before the $0.05 listing. The shift reflects BlockDAG’s commitment to accessibility, loyalty, and long-term alignment with its community. Visibility is another factor driving BlockDAG . Adoption metrics prove this isn’t empty marketing. The X1 mobile mining app counts over 3 million users, while thousands of X10 miners are already shipping globally. More than 4,500 developers are building 300+ dApps within its ecosystem. Whales are also active, with leaderboard buys of $4.4M and $4.3M, reinforcing confidence. Taken together, BlockDAG is more than hype; it’s one of the best crypto investments of 2025, backed by scale, adoption, and real-world visibility. 2. Cardano (ADA): Consistency and Scaling Power Cardano continues to prove itself as one of the most steady performers in crypto. Trading near $0.85, ADA has held strong support in the $0.75–$0.77 zone while eyeing resistance closer to $1.00. Scalability upgrades such as Hydra and Ouroboros Leios are laying the groundwork for higher throughput, while more than 300 decentralized applications are already live on the network. Large holders have recently accumulated 150M+ ADA, suggesting confidence in its roadmap. Speculation around a possible Cardano ETF has only added fuel to the discussion. For those mapping out the best crypto investments, Cardano’s mix of academic rigor, active development, and whale accumulation keeps it firmly in the spotlight. 3. XRP: Legal Clarity Meets Real-World Payments After years of regulatory uncertainty, XRP is finally operating with clear direction. Trading around $3.20, it has reclaimed strength as a settlement layer for cross-border payments, supported by multiple banking and fintech partnerships. The conclusion of its legal battles has restored focus on adoption rather than courtroom drama. With transactions that are fast and inexpensive, XRP continues to serve as a practical tool for global finance. This unique position is why it’s frequently listed among the best crypto investments in 2025. The combination of utility, regulatory clearance, and institutional ties gives it staying power few rivals can match. 4. Sui (SUI): Developer Growth and Market Buzz Sui is one of the most talked-about new networks, currently priced near $3.47 with a market cap of about $12 billion. Trading volumes hover close to $1 billion daily, and its circulating supply sits at 3.51 billion coins out of a 10B max cap. What sets Sui apart is its developer focus. A partnership with Alibaba Cloud has introduced an AI coding assistant for builders working in the Move programming language, making it easier to create applications on the chain. This has translated into growing traction in NFTs, gaming, and DeFi. For those seeking the best crypto investments in 2025, Sui’s combination of adoption signals and technical strength makes it a serious contender. Final Word BlockDAG, Cardano, XRP, and Sui highlight the key drivers shaping 2025: presale dominance, steady upgrades, regulatory clarity, and developer ecosystems. Among them, BlockDAG stands out for its nearly $400M presale, whale confidence, and the introduction of $0.0013 flat-rate pricing at its Deployment Event a move designed for fairness, transparency, and equal opportunity. Cardano provides a balance of stability and scalability, XRP offers proven utility under regulatory clarity, and Sui is capturing developer energy in next-generation applications. Together, these projects outline where the best crypto investments of 2025 are forming and why now is the time to pay close attention.

51417463,https://timestabloid.com/?p=82412,1757376034,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Shiba Inu (SHIB) Flashes Death Cross. Here’s The Implication,https://timestabloid.com/shiba-inu-shib-flashes-death-cross-heres-the-implication/,"Shiba Inu has drawn renewed attention after technical indicators revealed the formation of a death cross on its daily chart over the weekend. A death cross occurs when the 50-day moving average falls below the 200-day moving average, a signal that is generally interpreted as pointing to declining momentum and the potential for a price retracement. Second Death Cross in 2025 This is the second time the pattern has appeared on Shiba Inu’s chart this year. The first instance emerged in February and was followed by months of weak performance that eventually drove the token’s value down to the $0.00001 level in June. The timing of the latest development has caught some market observers by surprise. Only a month earlier, Shiba Inu formed a golden cross , which is usually taken as a bullish indicator. That event initially lifted investor expectations for a stronger rally. However, the positive sentiment proved short-lived as broader market conditions turned unfavorable. September has historically been one of the more challenging months for the cryptocurrency sector, and this year has been no exception. Ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, coupled with seasonal weakness, has added pressure on major digital assets. These factors reduced the impact of the golden cross and contributed to renewed selling activity in Shiba Inu. Despite these headwinds, the token briefly advanced to $0.000013 on August 29 before losing momentum in early September as the overall market trend shifted downward. With conflicting signals from recent chart patterns, traders are focused on Shiba Inu’s near-term movement. If the token manages to break above its daily moving average, bullish participants may aim for resistance levels between $0.000014 and $0.000016. On the other hand, if downward pressure intensifies, price action could mirror the decline that followed February’s death cross, making $0.00001 an important support level to watch. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 As of the latest update, Shiba Inu is priced at $0.00001291, reflecting a 4.03% increase over the past 24 hours and a 6.58% gain for the week. Since the beginning of September, the asset has advanced by 2.87%, bringing its average monthly performance to 6.94%. Market Activity and Token Burns Trading activity has also shown notable growth. Shiba Inu’s 24-hour trading volume rose by 39%, reaching $143.94 million. This uptick suggests that interest in the token remains strong despite the uncertain technical outlook. At the same time, the project’s burn rate recorded a sharp increase. Over the past 24 hours, token burns surged with approximately 1.3 million SHIB permanently removed from circulation across nine transactions. This mechanism, while relatively small in scale compared to the total supply, continues to be monitored by the community as a long-term support factor. The reemergence of a death cross on Shiba Inu’s chart has revived concerns about the token’s immediate direction.

Throughout past bull cycles, this band has historically served as a crucial support level, with price retesting it during corrections and bouncing off it to continue its upward trend. Why This Level Matters For Bitcoin Uptrend In an X post, full-time crypto trader and investor, Daan Crypto Trades, has pointed out that Bitcoin is currently sitting directly on top of the Bull Market Support Band. This level has long been regarded as one of the most reliable high-timeframe momentum indicators. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Key Support Amid Gravestone Doji – $120,000 Hangs In Balance Daan Crypto Trades noted that while Bitcoin has seen short-term consolidation at or even slightly below this band, it has never experienced a prolonged detachment for more than a week or two during a bull market. The broader market structure remains intact as long as Bitcoin continues to print higher highs and higher lows on the larger timeframe. However, any subsequent dips that occur while this structural integrity is maintained are generally seen as areas of interest and potential buying opportunities for investors. The Role Of Liquidity In Driving Bitcoin’s Next Move Bitcoin is showing the first bearish divergence against the Global M2 Money supply since the cycle lows began, and signaling a potential slowdown in momentum. According to Saint Pump, a market expert, a one-month liquidity pullback is expected in late September, coinciding with the Federal Reserve (Fed) anticipated rate cut amid job weakness. Related Reading: Analyst Says All Bitcoin Price Uptrend Are Duds Unless This Happens This confluence of a bearish technical signal and a macroeconomic liquidity event suggests that BTC’s recent poor price action since July and divergence with global liquidity will continue leading to a period of choppy price action. In addition, there will be volatile trading until global liquidity conditions improve in late October. Adding to the short-term pressure, October also marks the expected end of the four-year cycle, which historically brings additional selling activity. Despite these headwinds, no major cycle top or euphoria signals are evident. Saint Pump noted that the Trump Administration may unleash a monetary bazooka through a Fed takeover to stimulate the economy ahead of the midterms. As a result, this cycle could extend into late 2026, until Inflation fears resurface once the Fed overdoes it due to political pressures. From a technical perspective, the best bid scenario in a sell-off lies between $93,000 and $98,000, aligning with a retest of the weekly 55 Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which has sustained the bull trend since last year. While short-term volatility is expected, the broader uptrend remains structurally sound.

Currently, a crucial barometer for these sentiments, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , stands at a neutral 48. This reading, a slight dip from yesterday, signifies a balanced state in the market, where neither extreme optimism nor pervasive panic dominates. For many investors, understanding this index is key to navigating the often-volatile world of digital assets. Unpacking the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: How Does It Work? Ever wondered how market sentiment is quantified? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , provided by Alternative, aggregates various data points to give us a clear picture. It operates on a simple scale from 0 (representing Extreme Fear) to 100 (signifying Extreme Greed). This comprehensive index isn’t just a random number. It’s meticulously calculated based on six key factors, each contributing to its final score: Volatility (25%): Measures the current market’s price fluctuations compared to average values. High volatility often signals fear. Trading Volume (25%): Analyzes current trading volumes and market momentum. Strong, sustained buying volume can indicate greed. Social Media Mentions (15%): Scans various platforms for keyword mentions and sentiment analysis, reflecting public perception. Surveys (15%): While currently paused, these polls historically gauged investor sentiment directly. Bitcoin’s Market Cap Dominance (10%): An increasing dominance often suggests fear, as investors might be moving into the perceived safety of Bitcoin. Google Search Volume (10%): Tracks search queries related to cryptocurrencies, with sudden spikes often indicating panic (fear) or curiosity (greed). Together, these elements paint a holistic picture of the market’s emotional state, making the Crypto Fear & Greed Index an invaluable tool. Why Does a Neutral Crypto Fear & Greed Index Reading Matter? A neutral reading, like the current 48, indicates a period of market indecision. Unlike the extremes of “Extreme Fear,” which often presents buying opportunities, or “Extreme Greed,” which might signal an impending correction, neutrality suggests a wait-and-see approach among investors. During neutral phases: There’s less panic selling or impulsive buying. The market lacks a strong directional bias. It can precede significant moves, as sentiment builds towards one extreme or the other. This balance provides a window for careful analysis rather than reactive trading. It’s a moment for investors to reassess their strategies without the pressure of overwhelming market emotions. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights from the Crypto Fear & Greed Index So, how can you leverage the current neutral stance of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index ? It’s important to remember that this index is a sentiment indicator, not a direct trading signal. However, it offers crucial context for your investment decisions. Consider these actionable insights: Avoid Emotional Decisions: A neutral index helps to keep emotions in check. Instead of chasing pumps or panic selling, focus on your long-term investment plan. Conduct Deeper Research: With no clear market direction, this is an excellent time to research projects, understand fundamentals, and identify potential opportunities without the noise of extreme sentiment. Prepare for Shifts: Neutrality rarely lasts forever. Use this period to prepare for potential shifts towards fear or greed. Having a plan for both scenarios can prevent impulsive reactions. Diversify Your Portfolio: A balanced market sentiment reinforces the importance of a diversified portfolio, reducing exposure to single asset volatility. Ultimately, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a valuable lens through which to view market psychology, helping you make more informed and rational choices. Challenges and Limitations: What the Index Doesn’t Tell You While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a powerful tool, it’s not a crystal ball. It’s crucial to understand its limitations: Lagging Indicator: The index reflects past and current sentiment, not future price movements. It doesn’t predict what will happen tomorrow. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic news, regulatory changes, or technological breakthroughs can significantly impact crypto prices, and these aren’t directly captured by the index. Bitcoin-Centric Bias: While it uses overall market data, Bitcoin’s dominance heavily influences its calculation. Altcoin-specific sentiments might differ. Therefore, always combine insights from the Crypto Fear & Greed Index with fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and a broad understanding of the macroeconomic landscape. It’s just one piece of a much larger puzzle. Conclusion: Mastering Market Emotions with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The current neutral reading of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 48 offers a unique opportunity for thoughtful engagement with the crypto market. It’s a reminder that while emotions drive much of the short-term price action, informed decision-making based on a blend of tools and analysis remains paramount. By understanding how the index works, interpreting its signals, and recognizing its limitations, investors can navigate the exciting yet unpredictable world of cryptocurrencies with greater confidence and strategic foresight. Use this period of neutrality to refine your approach and prepare for whatever the market brings next. Frequently Asked Questions About the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Q1: What does a “Neutral” reading on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index mean? A1: A neutral reading, like the current 48, suggests that neither extreme fear nor extreme greed is dominating the cryptocurrency market. It indicates a period of balanced sentiment, indecision, or a “wait-and-see” approach among investors. Q2: How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index calculated? A2: The index is calculated based on a weighted average of several factors: volatility (25%), trading volume (25%), social media mentions (15%), surveys (15%), Bitcoin’s market cap dominance (10%), and Google search volume (10%). Q3: Can I use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index as a direct buy or sell signal? A3: No, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is primarily a sentiment indicator, not a direct trading signal. While extreme readings can hint at potential opportunities (e.g., “Extreme Fear” for buying), it should always be combined with other forms of analysis, such as fundamental and technical research, for informed decision-making. Q4: What are the limitations of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A4: Its limitations include being a lagging indicator (reflecting past/current sentiment, not predicting the future), not directly accounting for broader macroeconomic factors or regulatory changes, and having a slight bias towards Bitcoin’s influence on overall market sentiment. Q5: What should investors do during a neutral Crypto Fear & Greed Index period? A5: A neutral period is ideal for thoughtful analysis rather than impulsive action. Investors can use this time to conduct deeper research into projects, reassess their portfolio strategy, prepare for potential market shifts, and avoid making emotional decisions based on short-term fluctuations.

This development marks a significant step forward for Upbit and the broader blockchain ecosystem, promising enhanced scalability and efficiency for users. Reported by BWE News, the project already has a dedicated website live, showcasing Upbit’s commitment. Furthermore, Dunamu, Upbit’s parent company, has taken the proactive step of filing a trademark for the Upbit Giwa name, solidifying its presence in this innovative space. What is Upbit Giwa and Why Does it Matter? At its core, Upbit Giwa is a Layer 2 blockchain built upon the OP Stack. For those new to the concept, Layer 2 solutions are designed to address the inherent limitations of primary blockchains (Layer 1s) like Ethereum, particularly concerning transaction speed and cost. Think of it like this: if Layer 1 is a busy highway, Layer 2 is an express lane built on top, handling a high volume of traffic quickly and efficiently before settling the final results back on the main highway. This architecture allows for faster, cheaper transactions without compromising the security of the underlying Layer 1 blockchain. The significance of Upbit Giwa cannot be overstated. By leveraging a Layer 2 solution, Upbit aims to provide a smoother, more cost-effective experience for its users, opening doors for more complex and high-frequency decentralized applications (dApps). The Power Behind Upbit Giwa: Understanding the OP Stack The choice of the OP Stack for building Upbit Giwa is a strategic one. The OP Stack is a standardized, open-source development stack that allows developers to create their own Layer 2 blockchains, often referred to as ‘Optimistic Rollups.’ Here’s why the OP Stack is a powerful foundation: Modularity: It offers a flexible framework, allowing Upbit to customize its network to meet specific needs. Security: It inherits the robust security of the underlying Layer 1 blockchain, typically Ethereum. Developer Friendly: Its standardized nature makes it easier for developers to build and deploy applications. This technical foundation positions Upbit Giwa to be a robust and reliable platform, capable of handling significant transaction volumes and fostering innovation within its ecosystem. What Benefits Does Upbit Giwa Bring to Users? The introduction of Upbit Giwa is poised to deliver several tangible benefits to cryptocurrency users, particularly those interacting with the Upbit ecosystem. These advantages are crucial for driving wider adoption and improving the overall user experience. Key benefits include: Reduced Transaction Fees: Layer 2 solutions significantly lower the cost of transactions compared to Layer 1. Increased Transaction Speed: Users can expect faster confirmations and quicker settlement times for their activities. Enhanced Scalability: The network can handle a much higher volume of transactions, reducing congestion during peak times. New Possibilities: Lower fees and higher speeds enable new types of dApps and use cases that might be too expensive or slow on Layer 1. Ultimately, Upbit Giwa aims to make blockchain technology more accessible and practical for everyday use, aligning with the broader industry goal of mainstream adoption. The Road Ahead for Upbit Giwa and Layer 2 Innovation While the announcement of Upbit Giwa is exciting, it’s just the beginning. The success of any new blockchain network hinges on adoption, developer engagement, and continuous innovation. Upbit’s strong market position in South Korea provides a solid launchpad, but the real work of building a thriving ecosystem lies ahead. The broader trend of Layer 2 development is accelerating, with many projects competing to offer the best solutions. Upbit Giwa will need to demonstrate its unique value proposition and foster a vibrant community to stand out. As the crypto landscape evolves, expect to see more updates on Upbit Giwa’s development, partnerships, and the dApps that choose to build on its network. This initiative underscores Upbit’s commitment to staying at the forefront of blockchain technology and providing cutting-edge services to its users. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Upbit and Blockchain The unveiling of Upbit Giwa represents a significant milestone for Upbit and a promising development for the entire blockchain community. By embracing Layer 2 technology built on the robust OP Stack, Upbit is paving the way for a more scalable, efficient, and user-friendly cryptocurrency experience. This strategic move not only enhances Upbit’s offerings but also contributes to the ongoing evolution of decentralized finance and Web3. As we look to the future, Upbit Giwa has the potential to become a pivotal player, driving innovation and making blockchain technology more accessible to millions.

This isn’t just another transaction; it’s a major institutional endorsement that could redefine perceptions of Dogecoin. New York Stock Exchange-listed Cleancore Solutions (ZONE) has officially made its first substantial move into the meme coin market, signaling a bold strategic direction. This article dives into the details of this monumental acquisition and its potential ripple effects across the crypto landscape. Understanding Cleancore’s Strategic DOGE Purchase Cleancore Solutions, a publicly traded entity, recently made headlines with its acquisition of 285 million DOGE tokens. Valued at an impressive $68 million, this transaction was initially reported by Crypto Briefing. This move is not an isolated event; rather, it’s the initial phase of a much larger, ambitious plan. Cleancore had previously announced its intention to accumulate a significant portion of the total DOGE supply. The company’s long-term vision involves securing 5% of all Dogecoin in circulation. Their immediate objective is to reach one billion DOGE tokens. This initial Cleancore DOGE purchase represents a substantial step towards that goal, demonstrating serious commitment from a traditional financial player in the volatile crypto market. Such a large-scale investment by a listed company naturally raises questions about the future of Dogecoin. Why This Cleancore DOGE Purchase Matters for Dogecoin? Institutional investment in cryptocurrencies often acts as a powerful validator, lending credibility to previously speculative assets. Cleancore’s decision to invest heavily in DOGE is particularly noteworthy for several reasons: Enhanced Legitimacy: For years, Dogecoin has been viewed largely as a meme coin. A significant Cleancore DOGE purchase by a NYSE-listed company provides a level of legitimacy and institutional backing that could shift public and investor perception. Market Stability: Large institutional holdings can potentially reduce price volatility. As more tokens are held by long-term investors like Cleancore, the supply available for short-term trading might decrease, possibly contributing to greater price stability. Increased Adoption: Such high-profile investments can inspire other traditional companies to explore cryptocurrency acquisitions, potentially driving broader adoption of digital assets. Moreover, this move highlights a growing trend where established corporations are looking beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, recognizing the potential in other altcoins, even those with unconventional origins like Dogecoin. Consequently, this strategic move by Cleancore could inspire further corporate exploration into diverse digital assets. The Road Ahead: Challenges and Opportunities from Cleancore’s DOGE Purchase While the Cleancore DOGE purchase brings exciting opportunities, it also presents potential challenges. Integrating such a large amount of a volatile asset into a corporate balance sheet requires careful management and a robust understanding of market dynamics. However, the benefits could be substantial. For Dogecoin, this investment could: Spur Development: Increased institutional interest might encourage more development on the Dogecoin blockchain, focusing on utility and functionality beyond its meme status. Attract New Investors: Retail investors often follow institutional trends. Cleancore’s move could attract a new wave of investors who see this as a signal of Dogecoin’s maturity. Influence Price Action: While not guaranteed, significant buying pressure from a major entity could positively influence DOGE’s price trajectory in the long term, provided the company continues its acquisition strategy. However, the crypto market remains inherently unpredictable. Cleancore’s strategy will need to navigate regulatory changes, market sentiment shifts, and the ongoing evolution of the digital asset space. The success of this ambitious plan will be closely watched by the entire industry. What Does This Cleancore DOGE Purchase Mean for Institutional Crypto Investment? The Cleancore DOGE purchase serves as a fascinating case study in the evolving landscape of corporate crypto strategy. It signals a willingness among some traditional companies to embrace assets beyond the established giants like Bitcoin. This bold move by Cleancore Solutions could very well set a precedent, encouraging other firms to diversify their digital asset portfolios and explore less conventional cryptocurrencies. As the lines between traditional finance and decentralized finance continue to blur, such acquisitions demonstrate a clear trend towards mainstream integration. Investors, both retail and institutional, should pay close attention to how these developments unfold, as they could reshape the future of digital asset valuation and adoption. Furthermore, this move highlights a growing confidence in the long-term viability of various digital assets. In conclusion, Cleancore Solutions’ initial $68 million Cleancore DOGE purchase marks a significant milestone for both the company and Dogecoin. It underscores a growing institutional confidence in cryptocurrencies, even those with unique origins. This strategic move could pave the way for increased legitimacy, market stability, and broader adoption for Dogecoin, while also challenging conventional perceptions of value in the digital asset space. The journey to acquire 5% of DOGE’s total supply is just beginning, and its implications will undoubtedly resonate throughout the crypto market for years to come.

This isn’t just any stablecoin; it’s poised to become a cornerstone of the Hyperliquid ecosystem, and some of the biggest names in crypto are vying for the privilege. If you’re invested in the future of decentralized exchanges and stablecoin innovation, this story is for you. Sky’s Ambitious Proposal for Hyperliquid USDH Stablecoin Rune Christensen, the visionary founder of Sky (formerly known as MakerDAO), recently ignited this competition with a bold announcement on X. Sky is officially entering the race to issue the native Hyperliquid USDH stablecoin for the innovative decentralized exchange, Hyperliquid (HYPE). This move signals a significant strategic pivot for Sky and could reshape the future of stablecoin issuance within DeFi. Christensen’s proposal is designed to be highly attractive to the Hyperliquid community. Here’s what Sky is bringing to the table: Generous Yield: A Sky-issued USDH would offer a compelling 4.85% annual yield when deposited on Hyperliquid. This is a significant incentive for users. HYPE Token Buybacks: All proceeds generated from this yield are earmarked for direct buybacks of the HYPE token. This mechanism aims to benefit existing HYPE holders by potentially increasing the token’s value. Substantial Support: Sky plans to back Hyperliquid Genesis Star, a key DeFi project, with a substantial $25 million in USDH. This demonstrates a deep commitment to the Hyperliquid ecosystem. Why is Sky Betting Big on the Hyperliquid USDH Stablecoin? Sky’s decision isn’t just about issuing another stablecoin; it’s a strategic alignment with a rapidly growing DeFi platform. Christensen emphasized that a Sky-issued Hyperliquid USDH stablecoin would inherit the robust security and battle-tested infrastructure of the Sky protocol. This means users would benefit from a stablecoin backed by years of proven resilience and stability in the crypto space, enhancing trust and adoption. Moreover, Sky intends to migrate its own token buyback system to Hyperliquid. This strategic integration is designed to significantly enhance HYPE’s liquidity, creating a deeper and more efficient market for the token. This symbiotic relationship could create a powerful synergy between two major DeFi players, driving mutual growth and innovation. The Fierce Competition: Who Else Wants to Issue USDH? Sky isn’t alone in recognizing the immense potential of the Hyperliquid USDH stablecoin . The competition for issuance rights is fierce, attracting several other prominent contenders. These include established giants and innovative newcomers, each bringing their unique strengths to the table: Paxos: A regulated stablecoin issuer known for its compliance, auditing, and reliability within traditional financial frameworks. Frax Finance: A leading algorithmic stablecoin protocol with a strong presence in DeFi, known for its innovative approach to stablecoin design. Agora: A promising DeFi startup looking to make its mark in the stablecoin landscape, potentially offering a fresh perspective. This diverse lineup underscores the significance of Hyperliquid’s native stablecoin and the perceived value of becoming its issuer. The ultimate decision will likely hinge on factors such as security, yield generation mechanisms, community integration, and overall ecosystem benefits. What Does This Mean for Hyperliquid and the Broader DeFi Ecosystem? The successful issuance of the Hyperliquid USDH stablecoin by any of these contenders will be a game-changer for Hyperliquid. A native, high-yield stablecoin could significantly boost user adoption, increase trading volume, and strengthen the platform’s overall liquidity. This enhanced liquidity is crucial for any decentralized exchange to offer better trading experiences and deeper markets for its users. For the broader DeFi ecosystem, this competition highlights a growing trend: established protocols are actively seeking to integrate and collaborate with innovative platforms to expand their reach and utility. This development also emphasizes the ongoing evolution of stablecoins beyond simple price stability. Protocols are now leveraging stablecoins as tools for: Yield Generation: Offering attractive returns to users, making stablecoins more than just a store of value. Ecosystem Growth: Providing native liquidity and direct support for specific platforms, fostering stronger communities. Strategic Partnerships: Forging alliances between major DeFi players, leading to more integrated and robust financial systems. The battle to issue Hyperliquid’s native Hyperliquid USDH stablecoin is more than just a competition; it’s a testament to the dynamic innovation within decentralized finance. Sky’s compelling offer, combining attractive yields, robust security, and strategic buybacks, positions it as a formidable contender. However, with strong rivals like Paxos, Frax Finance, and Agora also in the running, the outcome remains keenly anticipated. Regardless of who ultimately wins, Hyperliquid and its community stand to gain significantly from this exciting development, promising a more liquid, secure, and rewarding experience. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the Hyperliquid USDH stablecoin? The Hyperliquid USDH stablecoin is the proposed native stablecoin for the decentralized exchange Hyperliquid. It aims to provide a stable medium of exchange and value within the Hyperliquid ecosystem, potentially offering unique yield opportunities. 2. Who is Sky (formerly MakerDAO)?

51419674,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=803006,1757378748,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51419674.jpeg,Ex-WhatsApp security chief files suit over privacy failures at Meta,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ex-whatsapp-security-chief-files-suit/,"A former Meta employee has filed a lawsuit accusing the company of allowing “systemic cybersecurity failures” at WhatsApp that put user privacy at risk. The complaint, filed Monday in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, comes from Attaullah Baig, WhatsApp’s former head of security. Baig alleges Meta retaliated against him after he raised concerns, including those directly to CEO Mark Zuckerberg, about serious flaws in the messaging app. Ex-WhatsApp security chief claims Meta ignored privacy risks The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleges that after joining WhatsApp in 2021, Baig uncovered security flaws that breached federal securities laws and Meta’s obligations under a 2020 Federal Trade Commission (FTC) privacy settlement . The case emerges against the backdrop of Meta’s broader legal battles, including its recent request for a U.S. federal judge to dismiss the FTC’s antitrust suit. That case accuses Meta of unlawfully consolidating power in the social media market by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. In its defence, Meta argues the FTC has failed to provide sufficient evidence that the deals were anticompetitive or harmful to consumers. The company contends that Instagram and WhatsApp have thrived under its ownership, benefiting from significant investments, improved security, and enhanced features. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan , Meta also rejects the FTC’s narrow market definition, pointing out that platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Reddit compete directly for users’ attention. In the current case, Baig claimed that in a security test with Meta’s central team, he found that about 1,500 WhatsApp engineers had unrestricted access to sensitive user data and could move or steal it without detection or audit logs. Meta disputed Baig’s allegations in a statement and sought to downplay his position and responsibilities. “Sadly this is a familiar playbook in which a former employee is dismissed for poor performance and then goes public with distorted claims that misrepresent the ongoing hard work of our team,” the spokesperson wrote. “Security is an adversarial space, and we pride ourselves in building on our strong record of protecting people’s privacy.” Whistleblower group Psst.org represents Baig alongside the law firm Schonbrun, Seplow, Harris, Hoffman & Zeldes. While the lawsuit does not allege that user data was directly compromised, it claims Baig repeatedly warned his superiors that WhatsApp’s cybersecurity shortcomings created serious regulatory compliance risks. The issues cited are the platform’s lack of a 24-hour security operations center appropriate for its size, inadequate systems to track employee access to user data, and the absence of a comprehensive inventory of data-storing systems, making proper protection and regulatory disclosure impossible. Baig’s attorneys argue in the lawsuit that his superiors repeatedly criticized his work and that he began receiving “negative performance feedback” just three days after his initial cybersecurity disclosure. Late last year, Baig informed the SEC of the alleged “cybersecurity deficiencies and failure to inform investors about material cybersecurity risks,” the suit says. A month later, Baig sent Zuckerberg the second of two letters, informing the CEO that he “had filed the SEC complaint” and was “requesting immediate action to address both the underlying compliance failures and the unlawful retaliation.” Meta denies allegations, calling the lawsuit a “distorted” attack on its record In January, according to the lawsuit, Baig filed a complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, noting “the systemic retaliation” he alleged he received after the security disclosures. The next month, the complaint says Meta dismissed Baig, citing “poor performance”. This occurred during the company’s February layoffs, which affected 5% of its workforce. The lawsuit argues that the timing and circumstances of Baig’s termination show a clear link to his protected activity. It came soon after his external regulatory filings, capping over two years of alleged systemic retaliation over his cybersecurity disclosures and pushing for compliance with federal law and regulatory orders. Baig’s attorneys said he filed a notice on Monday to move his SEC-related claims to federal court and had already exhausted all administrative remedies before pursuing the case.

Dunamu CEO Oh Kyung-seok recently made a pivotal announcement that could reshape digital finance in the region. On September 9th, Oh revealed that Dunamu, the operator of the major South Korean crypto exchange Upbit, plans to support a won-backed stablecoin through its innovative proprietary Layer 2 chain, Giwa. This development marks a significant step towards integrating digital assets more deeply into the traditional financial system, promising stability and accessibility for users. What Does a Won-Backed Stablecoin Mean for South Korea? For those new to the concept, a stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value. Unlike volatile assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins are typically pegged to a reserve asset, such as fiat currency (like the US dollar or, in this case, the South Korean Won), gold, or other cryptocurrencies. The introduction of a won-backed stablecoin is particularly impactful for South Korea. It offers a digital asset that mirrors the value of the South Korean Won, providing a stable medium for transactions and savings in the crypto space. This stability can reduce risks associated with price fluctuations, making digital payments and remittances more predictable. Moreover, it paves the way for greater regulatory clarity and acceptance within the domestic market, fostering trust among both institutional and retail users. Giwa Chain: The Backbone of South Korea’s New Won-Backed Stablecoin ? At the heart of this initiative is Giwa, Dunamu’s proprietary OP Stack-based Layer 2 chain. CEO Oh Kyung-seok highlighted Giwa’s design as “finance-friendly” during the USDC 2025 event, emphasizing its robust architecture built for stable operations. A Layer 2 solution like Giwa is crucial because it helps scale blockchain networks, offering faster and cheaper transactions compared to Layer 1 blockchains. This technical foundation is essential for supporting a high-volume, stable digital currency. Giwa’s design is not just about speed and cost; it’s also about reliability. The chain’s stability is directly linked to the extensive operational experience Dunamu has gained from running Upbit, one of the largest and most reliable crypto exchanges in South Korea. This deep understanding of market dynamics and user needs positions Giwa as a strong contender to facilitate the stable issuance and distribution of the won-backed stablecoin . The Power of Upbit’s Expertise and KYC Integration for the Won-Backed Stablecoin Dunamu’s decision to leverage its existing infrastructure and expertise from Upbit is a strategic move. Upbit’s long-standing operation in the South Korean market, coupled with its experience in managing staking services, provides a solid bedrock for Giwa. This operational prowess ensures that the stablecoin will be issued and distributed reliably and securely within the country. The expertise gained from managing a high-volume exchange is invaluable for maintaining the integrity and stability of a digital asset like a stablecoin. A critical aspect mentioned by CEO Oh is the potential integration of Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures. If required by regulations, Giwa could seamlessly utilize the existing KYC information of Upbit users. This capability offers several advantages: Streamlined Onboarding: New users would likely experience a smoother onboarding process, as their identities are already verified. Enhanced Security: Leveraging established KYC protocols strengthens the overall security framework, combating illicit activities. Regulatory Compliance: It positions the won-backed stablecoin for easier compliance with financial regulations, a key factor for widespread adoption. What’s Next for the Won-Backed Stablecoin and Giwa? The announcement signals Dunamu’s ambition to be a frontrunner in the evolving digital finance landscape. By providing a stable, regulated, and widely accessible digital currency, they are not only catering to the existing crypto community but also opening doors for broader mainstream adoption. The success of this initiative could set a precedent for other nations considering their own fiat-backed digital currencies. While the exact launch timeline and specific regulatory frameworks are yet to be fully detailed, the vision is clear: to create a secure and efficient digital financial ecosystem in South Korea. The won-backed stablecoin on Giwa chain has the potential to transform how South Koreans interact with digital money, offering a blend of traditional financial stability with blockchain innovation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a won-backed stablecoin? A1: A won-backed stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to the South Korean Won (KRW). This means one stablecoin unit is designed to always be worth one South Korean Won, providing price stability. Q2: What is Giwa chain? A2: Giwa chain is Dunamu’s proprietary Layer 2 blockchain built on the OP Stack. It’s designed to be “finance-friendly” and aims to provide a stable and efficient platform for digital assets, including the new won-backed stablecoin. Q3: How does Upbit’s expertise contribute to this project? A3: Dunamu, the operator of Upbit, leverages its extensive experience in running a major crypto exchange and its staking services to ensure the stable operation of the Giwa chain and the secure issuance and distribution of the stablecoin. Upbit’s existing KYC information could also be utilized for regulatory compliance. Q4: What are the main benefits of a won-backed stablecoin? A4: The main benefits include price stability (reducing volatility risks), potential for faster and cheaper transactions, enhanced regulatory clarity, and greater trust and adoption within the South Korean financial market. Q5: When is the won-backed stablecoin expected to launch? A5: While Dunamu CEO Oh Kyung-seok announced the intention to support a won-backed stablecoin, specific launch timelines and regulatory details are yet to be fully disclosed. The announcement indicates a strategic direction for the future. Q6: Will existing Upbit users automatically have access to the won-backed stablecoin? A6: The announcement mentioned that if KYC procedures are required, Giwa could easily leverage existing Upbit user KYC information. This suggests a potential for streamlined access for Upbit users, but specific access mechanisms will be detailed closer to launch.

The Altcoin Season Index is a crucial barometer, offering insights into whether smaller cryptocurrencies are outshining Bitcoin. Currently, this vital index stands at 52, a figure that has held steady from yesterday, providing a moment for investors to assess the landscape. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index: A Key Metric What exactly is the Altcoin Season Index , and why should you pay attention? Developed by CoinMarketCap, this index offers a clear snapshot of the broader altcoin market’s health relative to Bitcoin. It’s not just a random number; it’s a carefully calculated metric designed to help you understand market cycles. Here’s how it works: The index tracks the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Stablecoins and wrapped coins are excluded to ensure a true representation of market sentiment. An ‘altcoin season’ is officially declared when 75% of these top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day period. A score closer to 100 signals a strong altcoin season, indicating that altcoins are broadly performing better than Bitcoin. Conversely, a lower score suggests Bitcoin dominance. Why the Altcoin Season Index at 52 Matters A reading of 52 for the Altcoin Season Index places us in a neutral zone. It means we are neither in a full-blown altcoin season nor a period of overwhelming Bitcoin dominance. This steady state can be interpreted in several ways: Balanced Market: There’s a relatively even performance between altcoins and Bitcoin, suggesting a period of consolidation or indecision. Opportunity for Selection: While the broader market isn’t showing a strong altcoin trend, individual altcoins may still be performing exceptionally well. This requires careful research and selection. Anticipation: A steady index often precedes a shift. It could be building momentum for an altcoin surge or signaling a potential return to Bitcoin’s lead. For investors, this neutral reading underscores the importance of a diversified and well-researched portfolio. It’s a time to observe and strategize, rather than make hasty decisions based on broad market sentiment. Navigating Market Dynamics with the Altcoin Season Index Understanding the implications of the Altcoin Season Index can significantly influence your investment approach. When the index is high, investors might consider rebalancing their portfolios to capitalize on altcoin growth. Conversely, a low index might prompt a shift towards Bitcoin or stable assets. However, challenges persist in this dynamic market: Volatility: Both Bitcoin and altcoins are known for their price swings, which can quickly change the index’s reading. Information Overload: Sifting through hundreds of altcoins to find the next big performer requires dedication and due diligence. Market Psychology: Fear of missing out (FOMO) can lead to poor investment decisions, especially during perceived altcoin rallies. By using the Altcoin Season Index as a guide, you can make more informed decisions, reducing emotional trading and focusing on data-driven strategies. It’s a tool to complement your research, not replace it. Actionable Insights from the Altcoin Season Index So, what should you do when the Altcoin Season Index is at 52? Here are some actionable insights: Deep Dive into Fundamentals: This is an excellent time to research individual altcoins with strong use cases, solid development teams, and active communities. Monitor Bitcoin Dominance: Keep an eye on Bitcoin’s market capitalization dominance. A decline in BTC dominance often precedes an altcoin rally. Consider Risk Management: In a neutral market, re-evaluate your risk exposure. Diversify across different sectors within crypto, not just different coins. Stay Informed: Market conditions can change rapidly. Regularly check the index and other market indicators to adapt your strategy. The index serves as a reminder that the crypto market is cyclical. Periods of altcoin outperformance often follow periods of Bitcoin strength, and vice-versa. Being prepared for these shifts is key to long-term success. Conclusion: Your Guide to Crypto Market Cycles The current standing of the Altcoin Season Index at 52 offers a valuable perspective on the crypto market. It signals a balanced environment, urging investors to remain vigilant, conduct thorough research, and adapt their strategies to evolving conditions. While not a definitive buy or sell signal, it serves as an excellent compass, helping you navigate the complex world of cryptocurrencies and make more strategic investment choices. Stay informed, stay analytical, and be ready for what comes next. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does an Altcoin Season Index of 52 mean? A1: An index of 52 indicates a neutral market. It means that roughly half of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days, suggesting neither a strong altcoin season nor a period of dominant Bitcoin performance. Q2: How is the Altcoin Season Index calculated? A2: The index is calculated by CoinMarketCap. It compares the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) against Bitcoin over the preceding 90-day period. An altcoin season is declared if 75% of these altcoins outperform Bitcoin. Q3: Should I invest in altcoins when the Altcoin Season Index is at 52? A3: A reading of 52 suggests a balanced market. It’s a good time for careful research into individual altcoins with strong fundamentals, rather than broad market-wide altcoin investments. Diversification and risk management are particularly important. Q4: What typically happens after the Altcoin Season Index holds steady at a neutral level? A4: A steady neutral index can precede a shift in market dominance. It could lead to a renewed altcoin season if conditions become favorable, or a return to Bitcoin dominance. It’s a period of observation and strategic planning for potential future movements. Q5: Does the Altcoin Season Index predict future prices? A5: The Altcoin Season Index is an indicator of past performance and current market sentiment, not a direct predictor of future prices. It helps investors understand market cycles and make informed decisions, but it should be used in conjunction with other research and analysis tools. Enjoyed this insight into the crypto market?

Among them is veteran trader and self-described market psychologist Michael XBT, who recently posted a brief but attention-grabbing message on X. He advised followers to “watch XRP this week,” offering no further public details. The statement arrives at a time when XRP is down 9.63% on the monthly chart, fueling speculation that a rebound may be near. Michael’s forecasts carry weight because of his history of accurate calls, which has led many investors to treat his updates with caution but also anticipation. Watch XRP this week. That’s all I’m going to say publicly. My group members know why… — Crypto Michael (@MichaelXBT) September 7, 2025 History of Accurate Predictions Michael XBT has previously delivered bold projections that later proved correct. In mid-2024, when XRP was valued at $0.50, he suggested the token was on the verge of breaking free from a multi-year consolidation pattern. Within months, XRP surged to $3.40 by January 2025, a gain of nearly 600%, validating his analysis. Since that rally, the asset has largely traded above $2, cooling after the rapid climb. Michael has consistently framed this consolidation as a necessary adjustment rather than a sign of weakness. He has also argued that XRP’s next major move would likely coincide with a broader Bitcoin breakout, and his latest comments suggest that alignment could be approaching. Technical and Fundamental Alignment Other market commentators share his optimism. Analyst Davie Satoshi recently highlighted an Elliott Wave formation on XRP’s monthly chart, which indicates that the asset may be entering Wave III, historically the strongest phase of the cycle. Similarly, analyst Dark Defender has argued that XRP has finished its corrective Wave IV and could advance toward $4.50, provided the $2.85 support level holds. At present, XRP trades at $2.97, reflecting a 3.3% daily increase. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 EGRAG, another well-followed analyst, has pointed to XRP’s position above the 21-day exponential moving average as a sign of strength. He outlined short-term price targets near $3.90 and suggested that a much larger move could eventually push the token as high as $46 . Davie Satoshi, meanwhile, projected a potential range of $8 to $30, citing both technical and fundamental factors. Fundamental drivers identified by analysts include Ripple’s acquisition of Rail Financial, the introduction of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, global adoption of the ISO 20022 standard, and exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications involving XRP. These developments are viewed as complementary to the bullish technical outlook. Market Sentiment and Whale Activity Large investors also appear to be positioning for a possible move. Analyst Ripple Van Winkle reported evidence of significant whale accumulation during recent dips below $2.70, which he interprets as a strong support signal. In addition, forecasts generated by artificial intelligence models such as ChatGPT and Grok have shown favorable outlooks for XRP, further reinforcing market confidence. The convergence of technical signals, historical precedent, whale accumulation, and ongoing fundamental developments has heightened expectations for XRP in the near term. While market conditions remain fluid, analysts widely agree that this week could provide key signals for the token’s next direction.

Cardano Is Breaking Out Of A Falling Wedge Pattern In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a technical analysis (TA) pattern forming in the 4-hour price of Cardano. The pattern in question is a “Falling Wedge,” which belongs to the broader class of Wedges. Related Reading: Old Bitcoin Supply Keeps Moving Into ETFs: Data Shows Three Waves So far Wedges form whenever an asset travels between two converging trendlines. When the lines are sloped upward, the formation is known as a Rising Wedge. Similarly, price action to the downside creates a Falling Wedge. Wedges sound similar to Triangles, which also involve converging trendlines, but the key difference between the two is that Triangles are consolidation patterns, while Wedges involve some net movement up or down. Just like with Triangles, though, the trendlines of the channel act as support/resistance barriers for the price. Also, a breakout of either of these bounds can imply a continuation of the trend in that direction. Generally, Wedges are considered more likely to lead to reversals. A Falling Wedge may see the price eventually break past the upper line, while a Rising Wedge could end with a breakdown of support. Cardano has recently been moving inside a channel similar to a Falling Wedge. Below is the chart shared by Martinez, showcasing the formation. At the time the analyst posted the graph, Cardano was beginning to show signs of a surge beyond the resistance line of this Falling Wedge. The breakout attempt came as the asset was closing in on the convergence point of the trendlines. Near the apex of such patterns, price action occurs inside a tight range, so breakouts can become more likely. This could be what was developing for ADA at the time. Martinez noted in the post that the cryptocurrency must break past $0.84 to confirm the bullish breakout. Since then, ADA has surged further, reaching the $0.85 level. Thus, it’s possible that a sustainable break could really be kicking off for the coin, at least if the Falling Wedge is anything to go by.

As displayed in the chart, Solana has been trading inside this Rising Wedge for a few months now and is slowly inching toward the end of it. If the pattern is going to be a reversal one, then a bearish breakout may be coming for SOL. ADA Price At the time of writing, Cardano is floating around $0.851, up almost 4% over the last seven days.
