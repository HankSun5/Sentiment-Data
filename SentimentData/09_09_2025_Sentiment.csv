Optimism price prediction for 2028 suggests the token could reach a maximum value of $11.14. In 2031, OP tokens will range between $27.9 and $33.66, with an average value of $28.88. Optimism’s (OP) commitment to innovation is highlighted by its support for Layer-3 solutions. These solutions enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Layer-2 chains, contributing to the expansive Optimism Superchain. The platform’s initiatives, including introducing custom gas tokens and Plasma mode aimed at reducing onboarding and operational costs, make it more accessible for new users and developers. As the market closely watches the price movements and growth trajectory of the token, can Optimism reach $10 soon? Let’s get into the OP price prediction for 2025 – 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Optimism Token OP Price $0.7528 Market Cap $1.33B Trading Volume $172.64M Circulating Supply 1.778B OP All-time High $4.85 (Mar 06, 2024) All-time Low $0.4005 (Jun 18, 2022) 24-hour High $0.7571 24-hour Low $0.7172 Optimism price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 4.98% 50-Day SMA $0.7228 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 51 (Neutral) Green Days 15/30 (50%) 200-Day SMA $0.7521 Optimism price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: OP could be testing a key breakout level soon. Momentum is shifting in favor of buyers. Optimism 1-day price chart Today’s candle surged to $0.7513, breaking above the mid-Bollinger Band at $0.7216 and closing near session highs. This move follows weeks of sideways action, suggesting a potential trend shift. OPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD histogram just flipped green while lines are crossing upward, reinforcing bullish momentum. The next major test is the upper Bollinger Band at $0.791, while support now sits around $0.721. A daily close back below $0.720 would weaken this breakout attempt, but holding current levels keeps $0.791 in sight. Optimism 4-hour price chart The 4-hour shows a sharp rally with volume expansion, pushing directly into $0.750 resistance. Immediate support lies at $0.732 and the 21-SMA at $0.722. If price consolidates above $0.732, continuation toward $0.770–$0.791 is likely. However, rejection here could trigger a pullback to retest $0.710 or $0.697 as demand zones. OPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView Optimism technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.7157 BUY SMA 5 $0.7121 BUY SMA 10 $0.7221 BUY SMA 21 $0.7252 BUY SMA 50 $0.7228 BUY SMA 100 $0.6665 BUY SMA 200 $0.7521 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.7000 BUY EMA 5 $0.7028 BUY EMA 10 $0.7116 BUY EMA 21 $0.7204 BUY EMA 50 $0.7107 BUY EMA 100 $0.7198 BUY EMA 200 $0.8603 SELL What to expect from Optimism? OP is at a breakout zone. Holding above $0.732 keeps momentum toward $0.791, while rejection at $0.750 risks a pullback into the $0.710–$0.722 demand area before bulls try again. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it’s risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you’re willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will Optimism reach $10? Yes, Optimism is projected to close up to $10 by 2028. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

Optimism historic price sentiment Optimism price history by Coingecko OP launched with an initial value of $4.57 on May 31 but dropped sharply in June due to the UST stablecoin de-pegging and LUNA collapse, closing June at $0.5434.

OP saw an eventful 2024, reaching an all-time high of $4.85 in March before sliding below $2.30 by mid-April. After a brief recovery to over $2.90 in May, it entered a bearish phase, trading at $1.82–$1.96 by July and $1.54–$1.62 by October. November brought a spark of hope with a peak at $2.60.

The market cap is $2.24 trillion, with a supply of 19.92 million BTC. Beyond price action, the backdrop for Bitcoin is being reshaped by three powerful forces: Nasdaq’s push into tokenized stocks, growing institutional accumulation, and a tightening technical structure that hints at an imminent breakout. Nasdaq has officially filed with the SEC to allow trading of tokenized U.S. equities, a landmark step in merging blockchain with traditional markets. The proposal would allow investors to choose between conventional stock trades and blockchain-backed tokens flagged at settlement. It's official. @Nasdaq filed with @SECGov to enable tokenized securities trading, a historic move by a U.S. traditional exchange.

At the same time, institutions and sovereign players continue to accumulate Bitcoin. Japanese firm Metaplanet added 136 BTC this week, raising its holdings to more than 20,000 BTC (over $2 billion).

And Michael Saylor’s Strategy acquired another 1,955 BTC, worth about $217 million, bringing its total stash to 638,460 BTC, cementing its position as the largest corporate holder worldwide. These combined moves signal that Bitcoin is not only being adopted at the financial infrastructure level but is also being increasingly absorbed by long-term holders, thereby reducing the available supply. MICHAEL SAYLOR JUST BOUGHT $217M $BTC AT $111,196 STRATEGY CURRENTLY HOLDS $71.58 BILLION OF BITCOIN AVERAGE PRICE: $73,880 pic.twitter.com/8X0G6RQ0py — Arkham (@arkham) September 8, 2025 What These Moves Mean for Bitcoin The implications of these events extend far beyond the headlines. Nasdaq’s tokenization leap could accelerate institutional adoption, providing new legitimacy for blockchain-based settlement and giving Bitcoin indirect exposure through increased trust in the ecosystem. Sovereign and corporate purchases underscore a growing conviction that Bitcoin can serve as a hedge against economic fragility and fiat currency devaluation, Metaplanet’s goal of reaching 210,000 BTC by 2027 underlines this strategic shift. Constrained supply —with more than 19.9 million BTC mined and fewer than 1.1 million left to be issued—means that institutional buying directly amplifies scarcity pressures. Together, these drivers create a foundation for Bitcoin to extend its gains higher, provided technical levels remain aligned. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Outlook: Triangle Breakout in Focus Bitcoin is consolidating in an ascending triangle, a bullish continuation pattern. Price is at $112,387, pressing against resistance at $113,400 and making higher lows since late August. The 50 SMA at $111,230 is support, while the 200 SMA at $112,777 is the immediate resistance. A sustained EMA crossover here would add fuel to the fire. Candlestick action has gone from indecision (Doji and spinning tops) to green closes, accumulation. The RSI at 62 remains firm but not overheated, suggesting upside room remains before momentum stretches. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview If Bitcoin breaks $113,400 with volume, the following upside targets sit at $115,400 and $117,150, levels highlighted by TradingView’s breakout path. Such a move would confirm that recent compression was the staging ground for renewed strength. Conversely, a failure to hold $111,500 risks a drop to $110,000 or $108,450; however, the rising trendline suggests that dips remain corrective rather than signs of reversal. For traders, a long entry above $113,400 presents an attractive setup, with stops placed below $111,200 to manage risk. A breakout could position Bitcoin for its next leg higher, potentially setting the stage for a push toward six-figure territory and even the $130,000 milestone in the coming cycle.

Related Reading: Why $50 XRP By December 2025 Isn’t ‘Hopium’ If ETFs Get Greenlight: Analyst According to reports, Lee says the market’s recent weakness is tied to the Federal Reserve’s reluctance to cut interest rates, while Schiff points to gold’s recent rally as a warning sign for Bitcoin. Schiff Points To Gold’s Rally In an X post, the gold bug Schiff highlighted that the yellow metal rose 10% over the last two months and reached a new high of $3,620. “Markets are forward-looking. That’s why gold is up 10% in advance of coming rate cuts,” he said, arguing that gold’s move shows traders expect easier policy ahead. Bitcoin, he added, has not followed gold’s lead, and that gap worries him. Permabull @fundstrat forecast Bitcoin will hit $200K by year-end, as Bitcoin is sensitive to Fed rate cuts. He said the Fed’s two-month pause is why Bitcoin hasn’t rallied over that time period. But gold rallied 10% during those two months, hitting a record $3,620 as he spoke. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) September 8, 2025 Lee’s $200,000 Call And His Explanation Tom Lee remains optimistic. He has argued that the influx of institutional investors gives Bitcoin new “counter-cyclical characteristics,” and that bigger players could push prices much higher over time. Based on reports, Lee blames the recent underperformance on the Fed and keeps the $200,000 figure in public view. His stance continues to make him one of Wall Street’s best-known permabulls – persons who maintain a perpetually optimistic outlook. Market Odds And Traders’ View Polymarket users appear unconvinced by Lee’s timetable. At press time, markets show an 8% chance of Bitcoin reaching $200k this year. The same markets place roughly an 8% chance on Bitcoin dropping below $70,000 by the end of 2025. Those odds suggest bettors are split and that headline targets are being treated with skepticism. Source: Polymarket A Broader Performance Check Schiff has also pointed to longer-term measurements. He noted that Bitcoin is down 16% against gold over the past four years, even though the cryptocurrency has posted strong gains versus the US dollar in that span. He warned that when “more air” comes out of the Bitcoin bubble, the four-year returns may look weak. The idea that the old four-year cycle tied to halvings may be fading was raised by other analysts in recent commentary, and that debate is ongoing. Related Reading: Tighter Premiums Put Crypto Treasuries On Risky Road, According To NYDIG What Comes Next For Bitcoin Schiff went further by saying Bitcoin is more likely to sink below $100k than to reach $200k, putting a cautious spin on the outlook. This view makes clear where Schiff stands: he treats gold’s rally as a forward signal about future policy and believes Bitcoin’s lag is not a short-term quirk but a structural concern. Lee’s counter is that institutional flows could change how Bitcoin moves over time.

Government Figures Show 21 BTC Were Added According to President Nayib Bukele and the country’s Bitcoin Office, the government bought 21 BTC on Sunday as a symbolic nod to Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap. Reports show the state has continued buying one BTC per day. The buying has been carried out since March 2024. Based on government figures and blockchain data, El Salvador now holds 6,313 BTC. The holdings are valued at about $700 million at current prices. Small in daily budget terms, these moves carry big political weight. Buying 21 bitcoin for Bitcoin Day. pic.twitter.com/3X4yKeiqzg — Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) September 7, 2025 Clash With IMF Loan Terms Reports have disclosed that the purchases confound a $1.4 billion IMF loan agreement signed in December last year. The deal required public entities to halt voluntary accumulation of Bitcoin and called for a freeze on further acquisitions under the finalized Extended Fund Facility. As part of the agreement, the government revised the Bitcoin Law so merchant acceptance is voluntary, agreed to liquidate the Fidebitcoin trust, and planned an exit from the Chivo wallet program. Yet purchases have continued. That has left IMF officials and outside observers watching whether future disbursements will be granted, since compliance reviews are scheduled through 2027. IMF Estimates And The Question Of Disclosure Based on an IMF report from March, the fund estimates El Salvador spent roughly $300 million on Bitcoin since 2021. At current market levels, those purchases represent more than $400 million in unrealized gains. But the IMF also noted that limited disclosure around transactions and holdings makes a full independent assessment difficult. Government disclosure of Bitcoin activity remains incomplete, even with public dashboards now in place. Reports have noted that unrealized gains could be affected if market prices decline. On Bitcoin, Security Moves And Public Transparency Late last month, the National Bitcoin Office redistributed holdings across multiple addresses, placing a cap of roughly 500 BTC per address. Officials said the change was motivated by concerns about future quantum computing threats . The new addresses were published on a public dashboard, a move intended to boost clarity over custody. Some market and industry observers welcome the dashboard. Others say the quantum argument sounds precautionary and that clearer audit standards are still needed. Bold But Divisive Four years after adopting Bitcoin as legal tender, El Salvador’s approach is still splitting opinion. Supporters say the country has built strong gains and stayed committed to its plan, while critics warn it has created problems with international lenders. The anniversary shows that El Salvador’s Bitcoin push is still seen by many as bold, but also deeply disputed.

This month, three projects stand out for their unique narratives and market strategies: BullZilla ($BZIL) , Dogwifhat, and Pudgy Penguins. Each one brings something different to the table, from explosive ROI potential to steady technical setups and powerful brand expansion. For financial students, analysts, and crypto enthusiasts, identifying the best meme coin presales in September 2025 is not just about chasing hype, it’s about understanding the mechanics that drive long-term growth. As this article explores BullZilla’s presale, Dogwifhat’s resilience, and Pudgy Penguins’ ecosystem, it becomes clear why these tokens belong to the best meme coin presales in September 2025 list. BullZilla — Forged on Ethereum, Fuelled by the HODL Furnace BullZilla presale currently rides at stage “Dead Wallets Don’t Lie.” This is the first phase of its launch on Ethereum. It trades at $0.00003241. So far, the presale has raised over $257k, with 900+ token holders already onboard. The returns are staggering: earliest participants saw 463 % ROI up until stage 2A. From stage 2A to listing, the current ROI is 16,164× (1,616,400 %) based on a projected listing price of $0.0052. BullZilla is built atop Ethereum, drawing on its security, liquidity, and DeFi ecosystem. This “forged in Ethereum’s blue fire” framework supports BullZilla’s standout feature: the HODL Furnace. This staking system encourages long-term commitment by offering a 70 % APY for locking $BZIL tokens. It works to convert “paper hands” into “diamond claws.” As rewards grow over time through vesting, committed holders earn increasing benefits. Investment Scenario An investment scenario: $2,500 placed at the presale price of $0.00003241 buys roughly 77 million $BZIL tokens. With a listing price of $0.0052, that stake could become worth about $400,400, a potential gain of nearly 160×. The powerful incentive to stake in the HODL Furnace means holders earn yield while possibly watching their holdings multiply. These design elements, Ethereum backbone, 70 % APY, vesting rewards, referral systems, tie Bull Zilla into mainstream DeFi and community growth. The presale mechanics, with dynamic scarcity and structured phases, dramatize potential explosive ROI while anchoring the project in security. Dogwifhat — Steady Consolidation, Poised for a Break Dogwifhat (WIF) trades in a tight range between $0.80 and $0.83, showing resilience as buyers defend $0.80 while resistance builds at $0.83. Intraday swings are shrinking, suggesting the token is consolidating before its next directional move. Technical indicators, like RSI near 46, point to neutral momentum. MACD histogram turning positive, whale buying, and growing liquidity support a cautious rebound setup. If $0.80 holds, WIF could rise toward $0.90–$1.00. But a breakdown risks deeper losses. Another outlook projects a strong rally: breaking above $0.94 could open the path to $2.50–$3.00 within weeks, implying a potential 200–266 % gain from its current level. Dogwifhat’s profile now blends stability and momentum. Its top-150 market cap and near-billion-token supply hint at institutional traction. The balance between supply and demand could set up a breakout if key resistance breaks. Pudgy Penguins — From NFTs to Brand Power & Market Might Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) stands out for its transformation from an NFT icon to a $1.9–$2.0 billion meme coin token, priced around $0.03. Analysts see technical patterns like cup-and-handle, wedge breakouts, and whale accumulation, suggesting gains toward $0.04–$0.06. Its expansion spans merchandise, IP development, animated series, toy licensing, and token utility on the Solana-based Abstract network. The Canary PENGU ETF proposal, holding mostly PENGU tokens and NFTs, signals institutional interest. Analysts highlight its deflationary and scarcity model, blended with brand loyalty and community engagement. One report underscores how Pudgy Penguins, XRPs, and BullZilla illustrate paths toward 100× gains. PENGU leverages storytelling and token burn mechanics; BullZilla combines presale engineering, staking, and DeFi pathways. Conclusion September’s crypto landscape is filled with noise, but separating signal from hype highlights the best meme coin presales in September 2025. BullZilla stands out with its Ethereum foundation and high-yield HODL Furnace, while Dogwifhat demonstrates disciplined consolidation with breakout potential, and Pudgy Penguins leverages brand loyalty for mainstream adoption. Together, they capture the spirit of meme coin evolution, blending innovation with risk. For those studying the market, tracking the best meme coin presales in September 2025 offers both a window into short-term strategies and lessons in long-term resilience. Whether through DeFi staking, technical analysis, or brand expansion, these tokens reflect why investors worldwide keep returning to the best meme coin presales in September 2025 for opportunities that can define portfolios. For More Information: BZIL Official Website Join BZIL Telegram Channel Follow BZIL on X (Formerly Twitter) Frequently Asked Questions for BullZilla Presale What is the HODL Furnace in BullZilla? It’s a staking mechanism on Ethereum where users lock $BZIL tokens to earn 70 % APY. The longer they stay staked, the more they earn through vesting. How realistic is the ROI figure for BullZilla stage-2A investors? Early investors saw around 463 % ROI up to stage 2A. From there to listing, the theoretical ROI is 16,164× if the listing price hits $0.0052. This assumes successful listing and market interest. Why might Dogwifhat rally significantly? Its tight consolidation between $0.80–$0.83, neutral RSI, and rising MACD suggest momentum is building. If resistance is broken, some forecasts project gains beyond $2.50. What drives Pudgy Penguins’ value? PENGU’s value stems from its NFT heritage, new token utility on Solana, brand licensing, animated media, and potential ETF inclusion—all supported by technical chart setups. Are these investments low risk? All involve market volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and speculative elements. This article is purely informational.

As a result, some key staff will leave the British auction house, according to sources close to the developments, casting doubt on the future of its on-chain initiatives. Christie’s will continue in the digital art sector The restructuring exercise has reportedly seen two employees let go at the end of last month. These include the department’s vice president of Digital Art, Nicole Sales Giles, who confirmed the news to Now Media. A spokesperson for Christie’s revealed in an official statement that the move was more of a strategic realignment as opposed to a total withdrawal from the space. “Christie’s has made a strategic decision to reformat digital art sales,” the spokesperson told Now Media. “The company will continue to sell digital art within the larger 20 th and 21 st Century Art category.” Christie’s spokesperson. The move reportedly marks a sharp reversal from the auction house’ stance just a few years ago. The auction house in March 2021 ignited an NFT bull run with a record shattering $69 million sale of digital art work – “Everydays: The First 5000 Days” by the artist Beeple. The sale was reportedly credited with legitimizing NFT and position traditional art institutions as key players in the nascent digital market. This also comes as part of wide-spread changes under the auction house’s new chief executive officer Bonnie Brennan, who took over as CEO in February this year. Dissolving the department has raised questions about the future of the auction house’s dedicated on-chain auction platform known as 3.0, which was launched in September 2022. The auction platform was a flagship of a project that the digital art team, which had also fronted exhibitions and partnerships among them “Getway” events with Now Media during Art Basel Miami and Frieze Seoul. The decision comes amid a challenging time for the digital art sector Christie’s strategic shift does not occur in isolation as it comes at a tough time for the digital art sector, which has seen platforms like MakersPlace, KnownOrigin, and Async Art shut down over the past two years amid a cooling market. For Christie’s, the rise in AI in art creation has also created problems for the auction house as the battle between artists and AI companies continue to intensify. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan, the auction house was in the middle of a storm in February when thousands of artists came together to stop the renowned auction house from sale of AI generated art arguing this was “mass theft” of human creativity. This was not the first nor last case, reflecting conflict over the use of AI technology in the art and entertainment industry with artists complaining over various issues like copyright infringement. One of the prominent cases involved a group of artists that took Meta to court in 2023 over allegations that the social media giant was misusing their books to train AI models, particularly Llama, which powers its chatbots. While the auction house is expected to continue to offer digital works, folding them into its broader contemporary art sales signals a move away from the standalone and specialized focus that defined the market’s peak.

The South Korean media outlet MoneyS reported that Tether officials are in the country to attend a domestic blockchain conference. But the executives are also reportedly planning meetings with a range of domestic fintech companies, including the neobank Toss. The headquarters of Shinhan Bank in central Seoul, South Korea. Tether officials met senior Shinhan executives at the building in the morning of September 8, with stablecoins on the agenda. (Source: Mobius6 [CC BY-SA 4.0]) Tether, Korean Banks Hold Stablecoin Talks The media outlet wrote that several Tether executives attended the Shinhan meeting, including Vice President Marco Dal Lago, the firm’s head of Global Expansions and Strategic Partnerships. Quynh Le, Tethers’ Regional Expansion Lead in the APAC area, and Andres Kim, the firm’s Bolivia-based Expansion Manager, were also in attendance. The summit is Shinhan Financial Group Chairman Jin Ok-dong’s second meeting with a major US stablecoin issuer in the space of a month. Jin and several rival South Korean bank heads met Heath Tarbert, the head of the USD Coin issuer Circle, during the latter’s visit to Seoul late last month . A Shinhan Financial Group official told media representatives that Shinhan and Tether “plan to continue discussing ways to build mutual networks.” South Korean lawmakers continue to push forward with plans to regulate KRW-pegged stablecoins. Evidently sensing an opportunity, both Tether and Circle have recently sent delegations to Seoul. Cho Young-seo, the Vice President of KB Kookmin Bank, is also set to meet Tether representatives on September 10. KEB Hana Financial Group and Woori Financial Group officials have already spoken to Tether officials about stablecoins. The parties held meetings on August 26.

MoneyS concluded that “global companies with established issuance and distribution networks” are likely to continue discussing collaboration options with domestic financial institutions until lawmakers come to an agreement. Allowing South Korean firms to issue stablecoins was a key manifesto pledge for President Lee Jae-myung ahead of June’s elections. Since Lee came to power, scores of major banks and leading IT firms have registered KRW-pegged stablecoin -related trademarks. These include the internet giants Kakao and Naver. Both of the firms operate widely used e-payment platforms. Experts believe stablecoin integration would be straightforward for both Kakao and Naver.

51416321,https://timestabloid.com/?p=82402,1757374259,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Beyond Wall Street: XRP’s Viable Paths in Remittances and Digital Economy,https://timestabloid.com/beyond-wall-street-xrps-viable-paths-in-remittances-and-digital-economy/,"When XRP entered the digital asset space more than a decade ago, its primary vision was to serve as a settlement rail for global banks, with the potential to replace or complement systems like SWIFT. Over time, however, major financial institutions have pursued other directions. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), proprietary payment networks, and internal settlement solutions have taken precedence, leaving XRP’s original “bank-focused” proposition in question. Critics often interpret this hesitation as a failure of XRP’s core mission. Yet, the assumption that XRP’s growth depends solely on Wall Street or large banks overlooks the broader landscape of opportunities. The asset’s utility extends beyond traditional finance and continues to expand across multiple industries. Retail Remittances as a Primary Driver One of XRP’s strongest applications lies in the global remittance sector. Millions of migrant workers regularly send money home to countries such as the Philippines, Mexico, Nigeria, and India. Traditional banking methods for these transfers are slow, expensive, and inaccessible to many. XRP offers faster settlements with significantly reduced costs, directly improving the lives of recipients. Practical examples already exist. In 2023, freelance platform goLance revealed that it uses XRP to pay workers in underserved markets. According to its CEO, Michael Brooks, delays and high charges imposed by traditional banks are unsustainable, especially for freelancers earning modest incomes. By adopting RippleNet and the XRP Ledger, goLance can transfer funds instantly, including during weekends, and at minimal cost. Considering that the global remittance industry is valued at approximately $860 billion annually, XRP’s role as a cost-effective bridge currency for individuals could represent one of its most sustainable avenues of adoption. Small Businesses and Corporate Payments Beyond individuals, small and medium-sized enterprises also face challenges with international transactions. Companies that depend on overseas suppliers or manage payroll for global workforces often require faster, cheaper alternatives to the conventional banking system. XRP’s ability to act as an intermediary currency for cross-border payments makes it a practical solution in these contexts. Japan’s SBI Holdings demonstrated this potential in 2023 by rolling out an XRP-powered remittance service targeting countries such as Vietnam, the Philippines, and Indonesia. Through this system, funds are transmitted in XRP and then converted into the recipient’s local currency, enabling efficient, low-cost transfers across Asia. XRP’s relevance also extends into the growing internet economy. Activities such as streaming payments, gaming transactions, and machine-to-machine transfers in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment benefit from a payment network that is both inexpensive and highly scalable. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 While stablecoins and Bitcoin’s Lightning Network have drawn early adoption in this area, XRP’s low fees and transaction speed position it as a viable competitor. Another source of strength for XRP lies in the development of the XRP Ledger (XRPL) . The ledger supports decentralized exchanges, automated market makers, tokenized assets, and compliance-oriented non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The presence of stablecoins within the XRPL ecosystem further reinforces the role of XRP as a native bridge asset, supporting liquidity and reducing transaction friction. A Diversification Asset in a CBDC-Dominated Future XRP may also serve as a diversification tool for investors in the future. Because a portion of XRP is permanently removed from circulation through transaction fees, its supply decreases gradually over time. This built-in scarcity could position it as a hedge in a global financial environment dominated by government-backed digital currencies, without requiring it to displace major currencies. The notion that XRP’s success depends exclusively on large banks no longer reflects its trajectory. While it may not fulfill its original vision of being the universal settlement rail for financial institutions, XRP’s relevance is reinforced by other applications—remittances, small business transactions, digital economy payments, ecosystem development, and investment diversification. Each of these areas individually may appear modest compared to the scale of global banking, but collectively they provide a diversified foundation for XRP’s continued growth. Even without full support from Wall Street, XRP retains multiple viable paths to long-term utility and adoption.

The chip giant, a foundational pillar of modern computing, is undergoing a significant transformation at its highest levels. This isn’t just a corporate reshuffle; it’s a strategic realignment under CEO Lip-Bu Tan, poised to redefine Intel’s future and its competitive edge in the global tech arena. Intel Leadership Undergoes a Strategic Overhaul: What’s Driving Tan’s Vision? Since Lip-Bu Tan took the helm as CEO in March, Intel has been charting a new course, marked by bold strategic moves and significant Intel leadership changes. The latest announcement signals a pivotal moment for the company, with Michelle Johnston Holthaus, formerly Chief Executive Officer of Intel Products, departing after over three decades. While she will remain a strategic adviser, her departure paves the way for a fresh wave of talent and a redefined organizational structure. This transition underscores Tan’s commitment to agile leadership and a renewed focus on innovation and execution. These shifts are not isolated incidents but part of a broader strategy to streamline operations and enhance Intel’s responsiveness to market demands. The company is clearly signaling a move towards a more specialized and customer-centric approach, aiming to accelerate product development cycles and reinforce its market position against intense competition. The Future is Fabricated: How Custom Silicon is Reshaping Intel’s Strategy One of the most exciting and forward-looking developments is the creation of a new central engineering group, specifically tasked with building a custom silicon business for external clients. This move represents Intel’s ambition to expand its reach beyond its traditional product lines, offering tailored solutions to a diverse customer base. This strategic pivot towards bespoke chip design and manufacturing is critical in an era where specialized chips are becoming increasingly vital for everything from advanced AI accelerators to high-performance computing and niche enterprise solutions. Heading this new group is Srinivasan ‘Srini’ Iyengar, a seasoned expert who joined Intel from Cadence Design Systems in July. His extensive expertise in chip design and verification will be instrumental in positioning Intel as a formidable player in bespoke silicon, directly competing with established foundry services and capitalizing on the burgeoning demand for highly optimized hardware solutions across various industries. New Faces, New Ambitions: Intel’s Play in the Evolving Semiconductor Industry Beyond internal transitions, Intel is injecting new blood into its senior ranks, bringing in top talent from across the competitive semiconductor industry . Kevork Kechichian, formerly of ARM, has joined as the head of Intel’s data center group, a crucial segment for cloud computing, enterprise solutions, and the foundational infrastructure that powers much of the digital economy. Jim Johnson has been appointed Senior Vice President and General Manager of Intel’s client computing group, overseeing the company’s core PC business, which remains a significant revenue driver. Furthermore, Naga Chandrasekaran, Chief Technology and Operations Officer of Intel Foundry, is taking on an expanded role, reinforcing the company’s commitment to its business unit that builds custom chips for outside customers. These strategic hires, combined with the new organizational structure, aim to accelerate product development, foster innovation, and strengthen Intel’s position against fierce competition, ensuring it remains at the forefront of technological advancement and market leadership. Beyond the Core: The Impact on AI Chips and High-Performance Computing The emphasis on custom silicon and the influx of specialized talent have significant implications for the future of AI chips . As artificial intelligence continues to permeate every industry, from healthcare to finance and autonomous systems, the demand for highly efficient, purpose-built AI accelerators is skyrocketing. Intel’s new central engineering group, with its focus on custom solutions, is perfectly positioned to cater to this need, designing chips optimized for specific AI workloads. This could enable significant breakthroughs in machine learning, deep learning, and edge AI, impacting everything from advanced data analytics to intelligent automation. For the broader technology ecosystem, including the infrastructure that supports cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies, Intel’s advancements in high-performance computing and AI indirectly support the underlying processing power and development of new innovations that rely on robust, efficient hardware. Steering the Giant: The Crucial Role of the Intel CEO in a Shifting Landscape The vision for these transformative changes is clearly being driven by Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan. His statement, “With Srini leading Central Engineering, we’re aligning innovation and execution more tightly in service to customers… We are laser-focused on delivering world-class products and empowering our engineering teams to move faster and execute with excellence,” highlights a clear strategy: customer-centric innovation and operational excellence. Tan’s leadership is not only about internal restructuring but also about navigating external pressures, such as the recent U.S. government plan to convert existing grants into a 10% stake in Intel. This deal was notably structured to penalize Intel if the company dropped below 50% ownership of its foundry unit, underscoring the strategic national importance of its manufacturing capabilities. These complex geopolitical and economic factors underscore the critical role of strong leadership in guiding Intel through a rapidly evolving and competitive global technology landscape, making Tan’s decisions paramount for the company’s future success. Intel’s recent leadership shake-up and strategic realignments signal a determined effort to reclaim its position at the vanguard of the technology world. By focusing on agile leadership, expanding its custom silicon capabilities, and bringing in top-tier talent, Intel under Lip-Bu Tan is poised for a significant transformation. These bold moves are critical for staying competitive in the rapidly evolving semiconductor industry and for meeting the escalating demands for advanced computing, particularly in the burgeoning fields of AI and high-performance computing. The coming years will reveal the full impact of these changes as Intel strives to build a ‘new Intel’ ready for the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century, solidifying its role as a key player in shaping the future of digital innovation.

51416683,https://timestabloid.com/?p=82399,1757374813,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Charts Don’t Lie: 3 Top Cryptos in September 2025 That Could Deliver High Upside Gains,https://timestabloid.com/charts-dont-lie-3-top-cryptos-in-september-2025-that-could-deliver/,"Every crypto cycle produces tokens that go from quiet whispers to center stage. In September 2025, analysts are pointing to three projects making waves: MoonBull, Brett, and Useless Coin. Each is attracting different kinds of attention, but all are on the radar for traders hunting big upside. What makes this list interesting? These aren’t random picks. Each of these meme coins has a unique hook, whether it’s the energy of a new launch, the community pull of a mascot, or the humor of a satire project. Let’s break down why these names are being counted among the top cryptos in September 2025. 1. MoonBull: Whitelist Energy That’s Hard to Ignore MoonBull ($MOBU) is bringing an unstoppable mix of bull momentum and meme energy to Ethereum. This isn’t just another meme coin floating on hype. It’s designed with exclusivity at its core. The whitelist is live now, and it’s where the real opportunity lies. Whitelist members get access to perks no one else will touch: Entry at the lowest possible price Secret staking rewards for those holding early Bonus token allocations that stack value Private hints on the roadmap, only for insiders These are strictly capped benefits. Once the whitelist closes, no second chances will appear, making MoonBull one of the most top cryptos in September 2025 for early movers. Why Scarcity Matters in MoonBull’s Case Here’s the deal: scarcity always fuels demand. When access is limited, the psychology of wanting in becomes even stronger. Traders have seen this movie before. A handful of past whitelist projects delivered massive upside within months simply because early access was reserved for the few who moved quickly. That’s what MoonBull is replicating. To secure a spot, traders need to drop an email into the whitelist form. Once approved, they’ll receive a private notification revealing the exact Stage One launch date before the public even knows. Bulls are already lining up. 2. Brett: The Base Community’s Mascot With Staying Power Brett, the ERC-20 token living on Coinbase’s Base layer-2, has become more than a meme. Inspired by the “Brett” character from Matt Furie’s Boys’ Club comic, it’s now the unofficial mascot of Base. That cultural anchor has given it a strong foundation with a community that thrives on identity and inside jokes. The token’s rise has been steady. Brett appeals to traders who enjoy the blend of nostalgia and new tech, a comic-based meme coin rooted in one of the fastest-growing ecosystems. Base itself is gaining traction, and Brett is positioned as its standout. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because Brett combines familiarity with fresh infrastructure. Its ability to rally a crowd around culture makes it one of the more top cryptos in September 2025 for those betting on community-driven growth. 3. Useless Coin: The Satirical Play That Keeps Gaining Attention On the other end of the spectrum sits Useless Coin. Built on Solana, this project does exactly what its name suggests – nothing. No roadmap, no governance, no utility. The satire is the point. It’s a critique of overhyped projects that promise the moon but never deliver. And strangely enough, that’s what’s making it valuable. The community embraces the irony, leaning into the absurdity of speculation itself. Traders see Useless Coin as a pure meme experience, thriving on culture, humor, and community banter rather than technical promises. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because it represents the raw speculative spirit that often drives meme markets. Its parody stance makes it one of the top cryptos in September 2025 worth watching, precisely because it refuses to play by the rules. Final Thoughts Based on the latest research, the top cryptos in September 2025 are MoonBull , Brett, and Useless Coin. Each has carved out its own lane: MoonBull with its exclusive whitelist perks, Brett with its mascot status on Base, and Useless Coin with its satire-driven speculation. For traders eyeing explosive upside, the common thread here is culture mixed with timing. From exclusivity to community strength to parody, these projects highlight how meme energy still drives crypto markets in unexpected ways.

Presales are usually announced on official project websites, crypto news outlets, or launchpad platforms. Always verify links and official sources before committing. What is the best crypto presale to invest in 2025? Analysts currently highlight MoonBull as one of the strongest presales of 2025 because of its whitelist access and limited supply. Which meme coin to buy right now? Traders are keeping close eyes on MoonBull for presale access, while Brett and Useless Coin are being watched for cultural and community-driven growth. Which meme coin will explode in 2025? There’s no guaranteed outcome, but MoonBull’s whitelist model, Brett’s Base community backing, and Useless Coin’s parody momentum make them strong contenders. Do meme coins have a future? Yes. Meme coins continue to thrive by blending culture, community, and humor. While speculative, they often lead new trends in crypto adoption and trader attention.

Especially intriguing is the buzz around Layer Brett , an innovative Layer 2 token currently undergoing a presale that’s capturing serious attention, quickly raising capital, and promising early adopters a unique blend of meme-fueled energy and undeniable blockchain utility. This isn’t just another flash in the pan; it’s a genuine contender. Layer Brett (LBRETT) is the best-looking crypto token for the future Layer Brett (LBRETT) is not merely another memecoin riding on a fleeting trend. This ERC-20 token is a next-generation Layer 2 beast built squarely on Ethereum, designed to fuse viral meme culture with tangible blockchain scalability. Think of it as Brett (original), but on steroids, with purpose. It’s an escape from the utility-free origins of its namesake, promising a robust ecosystem featuring high-yield staking rewards, seamless interoperability, and a truly community-driven roadmap. It aims to deliver real-world solutions without sacrificing the infectious energy of those memes. Layer Brett leverages cutting-edge Layer 2 technology to sidestep Ethereum’s notorious congestion. This means transactions happen off-chain, blazing fast, while still retaining the ironclad security and decentralization of the leading Ethereum network. It’s a game-changer. What does this mean for you? Blazing-Fast Transactions: Say goodbye to endless waiting times. Layer Brett offers near-instant settlements for everything from trading to staking. Ultra-Low Gas Fees: Tired of high fees eating into your gains? This Layer 2 solution slashes costs to mere pennies, making micro-transactions viable for everyone. Hyper-Incentivized Staking: Early buyers can stake their LBRETT tokens right away, locking in incredible APYs at 850%. That’s a serious passive income opportunity. Community-First Approach: Layer Brett isn’t just a technical marvel; it’s a movement. With a $1 million giveaway planned, it’s actively building a vibrant, engaged community from the ground up. Cardano (ADA) price prediction and Chainlink (LINK) market caps are already astronomical While Cardano (ADA) price prediction and Chainlink (LINK) have been hot topics for years, and they continue to be crucial players in the Web3 space, their growth trajectories often operate on different principles. Cardano, with its slow and steady development, aims to deliver institutional-grade DeFi solutions and smart contracts. Chainlink, the undisputed oracle king, powers decentralized data feeds across countless blockchains. Both are foundational, yes, but their market caps are already astronomical, for investors seeking the next big crypto, tokens like ADA offer distinct risk-reward profiles. They offer stability, but Layer Brett is geared for explosive early growth that more established assets simply cannot replicate. Layer Brett (LBRETT) is becoming the next 100x altcoin Now, about the price. When you compare Layer Brett ’s current presale price of $0.0055 to behemoths like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, or even Pepe, the potential for exponential growth is impossible to ignore. These established meme coin giants began small, often with little to no utility, before skyrocketing in value to the billions. Layer Brett, however, launches with a clear, tech-backed advantage: it’s a Layer 2 blockchain from day one. Analysts are whispering about Layer Brett becoming the next 100x altcoin, especially as it stands out against the purely speculative nature of Brett (original). The market for low-cap crypto gems is always ripe, and Layer Brett is poised to be a top gainer in the upcoming crypto bull run of 2025. Don’t let this best crypto presale slip through your fingers. Be part of the movement that truly defines the future of decentralized finance. Don’t miss this top meme coin opportunity.

On-chain flows show a $26M net outflow, hinting at accumulation despite fragile sentiment. Key levels: $4,200 as risk pivot, $4,500 as breakout trigger for bullish momentum. By Jainam Mehta Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) is holding steady around $4,314, attempting to stabilize after several weeks of rangebound movement. On the 4-hour chart, the token is pressing against the lower boundary of a descending triangle formation, with the $4,200–$4,250 zone acting as a firm support base. This level has been tested repeatedly without breaking, underscoring strong demand absorption. The Parabolic SAR remains above price action, reflecting ongoing pressure from sellers. Momentum, however, is neutralizing. The RSI hovers at 49, showing little conviction from either buyers or sellers. Analysts note that Ethereum is in a “wait-and-see” phase where rallies fade quickly and pullbacks are met with buying interest. ETH price dynamics (Source: TradingView) If ETH can clear the $4,450–$4,500 ceiling, the market could flip decisively bullish, with the potential to target $4,800. Conversely, a failure to defend $4,200 risks opening a move toward the $3,800–$3,900 liquidity pocket, which has historically served as a launchpad for recovery. On-chain flows and market tone Exchange flow data mirrors the cautious market structure. On September 8, Ethereum recorded a $26 million net outflow from exchanges, suggesting investors are moving tokens into cold storage. Such behavior often aligns with accumulation phases and price resilience. Still, opportunistic selling has emerged during recent dips, with inflows accompanying short-term declines. This duality reflects a fragile balance: long-term investors appear to be building positions, while shorter-term traders are quick to take profits. Market sentiment remains split. Intraday traders are watching the compression closely, while swing investors are focused on whether the $4,200 floor or $4,500 ceiling gives way first. Futures positioning has moderated after a strong summer, reinforcing the sense that Ethereum is preparing for a directional expansion. Outlook hinges on breakout levels Ethereum’s near-term trajectory is defined by two critical thresholds: $4,200 as the risk pivot and $4,500 as the breakout trigger. A decisive push above $4,500 could invite bullish momentum toward $4,800, while a breakdown risks pulling ETH toward the $3,800 pocket. In prior coverage, Ethereum was highlighted as coiling near $4,250, with traders awaiting clarity on flows and momentum. The latest stabilization above $4,300 shows resilience, but the token remains locked in a range where direction will depend on whether buyers or sellers seize control in the coming sessions.

According to on-chain data from CryptoQuant, this represents the largest whale distribution since July 2022, adding significant selling pressure to the market. The sell-off came from large holders controlling between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC. These whales had accumulated more than 270,000 BTC between April and August, only to reverse course and flood the market with supply. This aggressive profit-taking pushed Bitcoin prices below $109,000, marking a 5.5% monthly decline and breaking a four-month winning streak. Market Shows Signs of Bitcoin (BTC) Stabilization Despite the heavy distribution, recent activity suggests selling pressure may be cooling. Whale movements peaked on September 3, when more than 95,000 BTC changed hands in a single week, the largest shift since March 2021. However, the pace has since slowed to around 38,000 BTC per week as of September 6. Currently, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading in a narrow range between $111,700 and $112,000, signaling that some stability is returning. Analysts caution, however, that a looming “head and shoulders” pattern and an unfilled FVG at $114,000 could precede another sharp downturn. If this resistance zone triggers fresh selling, BTC could slide back toward $106,000, testing critical support levels. Institutional Buyers Take Advantage While whales have been reducing exposure, institutional investors appear to be absorbing some of the pressure. Corporate buyers and ETF inflows have provided what analysts call a “structural counterbalance” to whale dumping. For example, Japanese firm Metaplanet Inc. recently added 136 BTC to its treasury, bringing its total holdings to more than 20,000 BTC. Nick Ruck, Director at LVRG Research, notes that ETF-driven demand and corporate accumulation could stabilize Bitcoin even amid aggressive whale selling. However, the broader outlook remains tied to macroeconomic conditions, especially the Federal Reserve’s upcoming September 17 meeting, where interest rate decisions could significantly sway liquidity in risk markets. With Bitcoin still down about 11% from mid-August highs near $124,000, traders remain split: will institutional buying outweigh whale pressure, or is a deeper crash on the horizon?

Prices are swinging, new technologies are proving themselves in real time, and the search for the best crypto investments is at an all-time high. Certain projects are beginning to separate from the noise by showing adoption, liquidity, and relevance that extends beyond speculation. Rather than focusing on daily price pumps, this guide explores four names that are commanding attention: BlockDAG, Cardano, XRP, and Sui. Each represents a different strand of growth, whether it’s presale scale, regulatory clarity, or developer-driven adoption. Together, they highlight where the most promising opportunities lie in 2025. 1. BlockDAG: Nearly $400M Raised With Flat-Rate Presale Pricing BlockDAG is rewriting expectations around presales. With nearly $400 million raised and over 25.7 billion coins sold, it has already eclipsed the fundraising scale of many historical projects. At its Deployment Event in Singapore, BlockDAG introduced a flat-rate presale price of $0.0013 for the final 30 days before launch. This new model replaced confusing bonus tiers with a fair, transparent, and equal-access system, ensuring that every participant has the same opportunity to buy in before the $0.05 listing. The shift reflects BlockDAG’s commitment to accessibility, loyalty, and long-term alignment with its community. Visibility is another factor driving BlockDAG . Adoption metrics prove this isn’t empty marketing. The X1 mobile mining app counts over 3 million users, while thousands of X10 miners are already shipping globally. More than 4,500 developers are building 300+ dApps within its ecosystem. Whales are also active, with leaderboard buys of $4.4M and $4.3M, reinforcing confidence. Taken together, BlockDAG is more than hype; it’s one of the best crypto investments of 2025, backed by scale, adoption, and real-world visibility. 2. Cardano (ADA): Consistency and Scaling Power Cardano continues to prove itself as one of the most steady performers in crypto. Trading near $0.85, ADA has held strong support in the $0.75–$0.77 zone while eyeing resistance closer to $1.00. Scalability upgrades such as Hydra and Ouroboros Leios are laying the groundwork for higher throughput, while more than 300 decentralized applications are already live on the network. Large holders have recently accumulated 150M+ ADA, suggesting confidence in its roadmap. Speculation around a possible Cardano ETF has only added fuel to the discussion. For those mapping out the best crypto investments, Cardano’s mix of academic rigor, active development, and whale accumulation keeps it firmly in the spotlight. 3. XRP: Legal Clarity Meets Real-World Payments After years of regulatory uncertainty, XRP is finally operating with clear direction. Trading around $3.20, it has reclaimed strength as a settlement layer for cross-border payments, supported by multiple banking and fintech partnerships. The conclusion of its legal battles has restored focus on adoption rather than courtroom drama. With transactions that are fast and inexpensive, XRP continues to serve as a practical tool for global finance. This unique position is why it’s frequently listed among the best crypto investments in 2025. The combination of utility, regulatory clearance, and institutional ties gives it staying power few rivals can match. 4. Sui (SUI): Developer Growth and Market Buzz Sui is one of the most talked-about new networks, currently priced near $3.47 with a market cap of about $12 billion. Trading volumes hover close to $1 billion daily, and its circulating supply sits at 3.51 billion coins out of a 10B max cap. What sets Sui apart is its developer focus. A partnership with Alibaba Cloud has introduced an AI coding assistant for builders working in the Move programming language, making it easier to create applications on the chain. This has translated into growing traction in NFTs, gaming, and DeFi. For those seeking the best crypto investments in 2025, Sui’s combination of adoption signals and technical strength makes it a serious contender. Final Word BlockDAG, Cardano, XRP, and Sui highlight the key drivers shaping 2025: presale dominance, steady upgrades, regulatory clarity, and developer ecosystems. Among them, BlockDAG stands out for its nearly $400M presale, whale confidence, and the introduction of $0.0013 flat-rate pricing at its Deployment Event a move designed for fairness, transparency, and equal opportunity. Cardano provides a balance of stability and scalability, XRP offers proven utility under regulatory clarity, and Sui is capturing developer energy in next-generation applications. Together, these projects outline where the best crypto investments of 2025 are forming and why now is the time to pay close attention.

51417463,https://timestabloid.com/?p=82412,1757376034,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Shiba Inu (SHIB) Flashes Death Cross. Here’s The Implication,https://timestabloid.com/shiba-inu-shib-flashes-death-cross-heres-the-implication/,"Shiba Inu has drawn renewed attention after technical indicators revealed the formation of a death cross on its daily chart over the weekend. A death cross occurs when the 50-day moving average falls below the 200-day moving average, a signal that is generally interpreted as pointing to declining momentum and the potential for a price retracement. Second Death Cross in 2025 This is the second time the pattern has appeared on Shiba Inu’s chart this year. The first instance emerged in February and was followed by months of weak performance that eventually drove the token’s value down to the $0.00001 level in June. The timing of the latest development has caught some market observers by surprise. Only a month earlier, Shiba Inu formed a golden cross , which is usually taken as a bullish indicator. That event initially lifted investor expectations for a stronger rally. However, the positive sentiment proved short-lived as broader market conditions turned unfavorable. September has historically been one of the more challenging months for the cryptocurrency sector, and this year has been no exception. Ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, coupled with seasonal weakness, has added pressure on major digital assets. These factors reduced the impact of the golden cross and contributed to renewed selling activity in Shiba Inu. Despite these headwinds, the token briefly advanced to $0.000013 on August 29 before losing momentum in early September as the overall market trend shifted downward. With conflicting signals from recent chart patterns, traders are focused on Shiba Inu’s near-term movement. If the token manages to break above its daily moving average, bullish participants may aim for resistance levels between $0.000014 and $0.000016. On the other hand, if downward pressure intensifies, price action could mirror the decline that followed February’s death cross, making $0.00001 an important support level to watch. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 As of the latest update, Shiba Inu is priced at $0.00001291, reflecting a 4.03% increase over the past 24 hours and a 6.58% gain for the week. Since the beginning of September, the asset has advanced by 2.87%, bringing its average monthly performance to 6.94%. Market Activity and Token Burns Trading activity has also shown notable growth. Shiba Inu’s 24-hour trading volume rose by 39%, reaching $143.94 million. This uptick suggests that interest in the token remains strong despite the uncertain technical outlook. At the same time, the project’s burn rate recorded a sharp increase. Over the past 24 hours, token burns surged with approximately 1.3 million SHIB permanently removed from circulation across nine transactions. This mechanism, while relatively small in scale compared to the total supply, continues to be monitored by the community as a long-term support factor. The reemergence of a death cross on Shiba Inu’s chart has revived concerns about the token’s immediate direction.

Throughout past bull cycles, this band has historically served as a crucial support level, with price retesting it during corrections and bouncing off it to continue its upward trend. Why This Level Matters For Bitcoin Uptrend In an X post, full-time crypto trader and investor, Daan Crypto Trades, has pointed out that Bitcoin is currently sitting directly on top of the Bull Market Support Band. This level has long been regarded as one of the most reliable high-timeframe momentum indicators. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Key Support Amid Gravestone Doji – $120,000 Hangs In Balance Daan Crypto Trades noted that while Bitcoin has seen short-term consolidation at or even slightly below this band, it has never experienced a prolonged detachment for more than a week or two during a bull market. The broader market structure remains intact as long as Bitcoin continues to print higher highs and higher lows on the larger timeframe. However, any subsequent dips that occur while this structural integrity is maintained are generally seen as areas of interest and potential buying opportunities for investors. The Role Of Liquidity In Driving Bitcoin’s Next Move Bitcoin is showing the first bearish divergence against the Global M2 Money supply since the cycle lows began, and signaling a potential slowdown in momentum. According to Saint Pump, a market expert, a one-month liquidity pullback is expected in late September, coinciding with the Federal Reserve (Fed) anticipated rate cut amid job weakness. Related Reading: Analyst Says All Bitcoin Price Uptrend Are Duds Unless This Happens This confluence of a bearish technical signal and a macroeconomic liquidity event suggests that BTC’s recent poor price action since July and divergence with global liquidity will continue leading to a period of choppy price action. In addition, there will be volatile trading until global liquidity conditions improve in late October. Adding to the short-term pressure, October also marks the expected end of the four-year cycle, which historically brings additional selling activity. Despite these headwinds, no major cycle top or euphoria signals are evident. Saint Pump noted that the Trump Administration may unleash a monetary bazooka through a Fed takeover to stimulate the economy ahead of the midterms. As a result, this cycle could extend into late 2026, until Inflation fears resurface once the Fed overdoes it due to political pressures. From a technical perspective, the best bid scenario in a sell-off lies between $93,000 and $98,000, aligning with a retest of the weekly 55 Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which has sustained the bull trend since last year. While short-term volatility is expected, the broader uptrend remains structurally sound.

Currently, a crucial barometer for these sentiments, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , stands at a neutral 48. This reading, a slight dip from yesterday, signifies a balanced state in the market, where neither extreme optimism nor pervasive panic dominates. For many investors, understanding this index is key to navigating the often-volatile world of digital assets. Unpacking the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: How Does It Work? Ever wondered how market sentiment is quantified? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , provided by Alternative, aggregates various data points to give us a clear picture. It operates on a simple scale from 0 (representing Extreme Fear) to 100 (signifying Extreme Greed). This comprehensive index isn’t just a random number. It’s meticulously calculated based on six key factors, each contributing to its final score: Volatility (25%): Measures the current market’s price fluctuations compared to average values. High volatility often signals fear. Trading Volume (25%): Analyzes current trading volumes and market momentum. Strong, sustained buying volume can indicate greed. Social Media Mentions (15%): Scans various platforms for keyword mentions and sentiment analysis, reflecting public perception. Surveys (15%): While currently paused, these polls historically gauged investor sentiment directly. Bitcoin’s Market Cap Dominance (10%): An increasing dominance often suggests fear, as investors might be moving into the perceived safety of Bitcoin. Google Search Volume (10%): Tracks search queries related to cryptocurrencies, with sudden spikes often indicating panic (fear) or curiosity (greed). Together, these elements paint a holistic picture of the market’s emotional state, making the Crypto Fear & Greed Index an invaluable tool. Why Does a Neutral Crypto Fear & Greed Index Reading Matter? A neutral reading, like the current 48, indicates a period of market indecision. Unlike the extremes of “Extreme Fear,” which often presents buying opportunities, or “Extreme Greed,” which might signal an impending correction, neutrality suggests a wait-and-see approach among investors. During neutral phases: There’s less panic selling or impulsive buying. The market lacks a strong directional bias. It can precede significant moves, as sentiment builds towards one extreme or the other. This balance provides a window for careful analysis rather than reactive trading. It’s a moment for investors to reassess their strategies without the pressure of overwhelming market emotions. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights from the Crypto Fear & Greed Index So, how can you leverage the current neutral stance of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index ? It’s important to remember that this index is a sentiment indicator, not a direct trading signal. However, it offers crucial context for your investment decisions. Consider these actionable insights: Avoid Emotional Decisions: A neutral index helps to keep emotions in check. Instead of chasing pumps or panic selling, focus on your long-term investment plan. Conduct Deeper Research: With no clear market direction, this is an excellent time to research projects, understand fundamentals, and identify potential opportunities without the noise of extreme sentiment. Prepare for Shifts: Neutrality rarely lasts forever. Use this period to prepare for potential shifts towards fear or greed. Having a plan for both scenarios can prevent impulsive reactions. Diversify Your Portfolio: A balanced market sentiment reinforces the importance of a diversified portfolio, reducing exposure to single asset volatility. Ultimately, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a valuable lens through which to view market psychology, helping you make more informed and rational choices. Challenges and Limitations: What the Index Doesn’t Tell You While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a powerful tool, it’s not a crystal ball. It’s crucial to understand its limitations: Lagging Indicator: The index reflects past and current sentiment, not future price movements. It doesn’t predict what will happen tomorrow. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic news, regulatory changes, or technological breakthroughs can significantly impact crypto prices, and these aren’t directly captured by the index. Bitcoin-Centric Bias: While it uses overall market data, Bitcoin’s dominance heavily influences its calculation. Altcoin-specific sentiments might differ. Therefore, always combine insights from the Crypto Fear & Greed Index with fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and a broad understanding of the macroeconomic landscape. It’s just one piece of a much larger puzzle. Conclusion: Mastering Market Emotions with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The current neutral reading of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 48 offers a unique opportunity for thoughtful engagement with the crypto market. It’s a reminder that while emotions drive much of the short-term price action, informed decision-making based on a blend of tools and analysis remains paramount. By understanding how the index works, interpreting its signals, and recognizing its limitations, investors can navigate the exciting yet unpredictable world of cryptocurrencies with greater confidence and strategic foresight. Use this period of neutrality to refine your approach and prepare for whatever the market brings next. Frequently Asked Questions About the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Q1: What does a “Neutral” reading on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index mean? A1: A neutral reading, like the current 48, suggests that neither extreme fear nor extreme greed is dominating the cryptocurrency market. It indicates a period of balanced sentiment, indecision, or a “wait-and-see” approach among investors. Q2: How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index calculated? A2: The index is calculated based on a weighted average of several factors: volatility (25%), trading volume (25%), social media mentions (15%), surveys (15%), Bitcoin’s market cap dominance (10%), and Google search volume (10%). Q3: Can I use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index as a direct buy or sell signal? A3: No, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is primarily a sentiment indicator, not a direct trading signal. While extreme readings can hint at potential opportunities (e.g., “Extreme Fear” for buying), it should always be combined with other forms of analysis, such as fundamental and technical research, for informed decision-making. Q4: What are the limitations of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A4: Its limitations include being a lagging indicator (reflecting past/current sentiment, not predicting the future), not directly accounting for broader macroeconomic factors or regulatory changes, and having a slight bias towards Bitcoin’s influence on overall market sentiment. Q5: What should investors do during a neutral Crypto Fear & Greed Index period? A5: A neutral period is ideal for thoughtful analysis rather than impulsive action. Investors can use this time to conduct deeper research into projects, reassess their portfolio strategy, prepare for potential market shifts, and avoid making emotional decisions based on short-term fluctuations.

This development marks a significant step forward for Upbit and the broader blockchain ecosystem, promising enhanced scalability and efficiency for users. Reported by BWE News, the project already has a dedicated website live, showcasing Upbit’s commitment. Furthermore, Dunamu, Upbit’s parent company, has taken the proactive step of filing a trademark for the Upbit Giwa name, solidifying its presence in this innovative space. What is Upbit Giwa and Why Does it Matter? At its core, Upbit Giwa is a Layer 2 blockchain built upon the OP Stack. For those new to the concept, Layer 2 solutions are designed to address the inherent limitations of primary blockchains (Layer 1s) like Ethereum, particularly concerning transaction speed and cost. Think of it like this: if Layer 1 is a busy highway, Layer 2 is an express lane built on top, handling a high volume of traffic quickly and efficiently before settling the final results back on the main highway. This architecture allows for faster, cheaper transactions without compromising the security of the underlying Layer 1 blockchain. The significance of Upbit Giwa cannot be overstated. By leveraging a Layer 2 solution, Upbit aims to provide a smoother, more cost-effective experience for its users, opening doors for more complex and high-frequency decentralized applications (dApps). The Power Behind Upbit Giwa: Understanding the OP Stack The choice of the OP Stack for building Upbit Giwa is a strategic one. The OP Stack is a standardized, open-source development stack that allows developers to create their own Layer 2 blockchains, often referred to as ‘Optimistic Rollups.’ Here’s why the OP Stack is a powerful foundation: Modularity: It offers a flexible framework, allowing Upbit to customize its network to meet specific needs. Security: It inherits the robust security of the underlying Layer 1 blockchain, typically Ethereum. Developer Friendly: Its standardized nature makes it easier for developers to build and deploy applications. This technical foundation positions Upbit Giwa to be a robust and reliable platform, capable of handling significant transaction volumes and fostering innovation within its ecosystem. What Benefits Does Upbit Giwa Bring to Users? The introduction of Upbit Giwa is poised to deliver several tangible benefits to cryptocurrency users, particularly those interacting with the Upbit ecosystem. These advantages are crucial for driving wider adoption and improving the overall user experience. Key benefits include: Reduced Transaction Fees: Layer 2 solutions significantly lower the cost of transactions compared to Layer 1. Increased Transaction Speed: Users can expect faster confirmations and quicker settlement times for their activities. Enhanced Scalability: The network can handle a much higher volume of transactions, reducing congestion during peak times. New Possibilities: Lower fees and higher speeds enable new types of dApps and use cases that might be too expensive or slow on Layer 1. Ultimately, Upbit Giwa aims to make blockchain technology more accessible and practical for everyday use, aligning with the broader industry goal of mainstream adoption. The Road Ahead for Upbit Giwa and Layer 2 Innovation While the announcement of Upbit Giwa is exciting, it’s just the beginning. The success of any new blockchain network hinges on adoption, developer engagement, and continuous innovation. Upbit’s strong market position in South Korea provides a solid launchpad, but the real work of building a thriving ecosystem lies ahead. The broader trend of Layer 2 development is accelerating, with many projects competing to offer the best solutions. Upbit Giwa will need to demonstrate its unique value proposition and foster a vibrant community to stand out. As the crypto landscape evolves, expect to see more updates on Upbit Giwa’s development, partnerships, and the dApps that choose to build on its network. This initiative underscores Upbit’s commitment to staying at the forefront of blockchain technology and providing cutting-edge services to its users. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Upbit and Blockchain The unveiling of Upbit Giwa represents a significant milestone for Upbit and a promising development for the entire blockchain community. By embracing Layer 2 technology built on the robust OP Stack, Upbit is paving the way for a more scalable, efficient, and user-friendly cryptocurrency experience. This strategic move not only enhances Upbit’s offerings but also contributes to the ongoing evolution of decentralized finance and Web3. As we look to the future, Upbit Giwa has the potential to become a pivotal player, driving innovation and making blockchain technology more accessible to millions.

This isn’t just another transaction; it’s a major institutional endorsement that could redefine perceptions of Dogecoin. New York Stock Exchange-listed Cleancore Solutions (ZONE) has officially made its first substantial move into the meme coin market, signaling a bold strategic direction. This article dives into the details of this monumental acquisition and its potential ripple effects across the crypto landscape. Understanding Cleancore’s Strategic DOGE Purchase Cleancore Solutions, a publicly traded entity, recently made headlines with its acquisition of 285 million DOGE tokens. Valued at an impressive $68 million, this transaction was initially reported by Crypto Briefing. This move is not an isolated event; rather, it’s the initial phase of a much larger, ambitious plan. Cleancore had previously announced its intention to accumulate a significant portion of the total DOGE supply. The company’s long-term vision involves securing 5% of all Dogecoin in circulation. Their immediate objective is to reach one billion DOGE tokens. This initial Cleancore DOGE purchase represents a substantial step towards that goal, demonstrating serious commitment from a traditional financial player in the volatile crypto market. Such a large-scale investment by a listed company naturally raises questions about the future of Dogecoin. Why This Cleancore DOGE Purchase Matters for Dogecoin? Institutional investment in cryptocurrencies often acts as a powerful validator, lending credibility to previously speculative assets. Cleancore’s decision to invest heavily in DOGE is particularly noteworthy for several reasons: Enhanced Legitimacy: For years, Dogecoin has been viewed largely as a meme coin. A significant Cleancore DOGE purchase by a NYSE-listed company provides a level of legitimacy and institutional backing that could shift public and investor perception. Market Stability: Large institutional holdings can potentially reduce price volatility. As more tokens are held by long-term investors like Cleancore, the supply available for short-term trading might decrease, possibly contributing to greater price stability. Increased Adoption: Such high-profile investments can inspire other traditional companies to explore cryptocurrency acquisitions, potentially driving broader adoption of digital assets. Moreover, this move highlights a growing trend where established corporations are looking beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, recognizing the potential in other altcoins, even those with unconventional origins like Dogecoin. Consequently, this strategic move by Cleancore could inspire further corporate exploration into diverse digital assets. The Road Ahead: Challenges and Opportunities from Cleancore’s DOGE Purchase While the Cleancore DOGE purchase brings exciting opportunities, it also presents potential challenges. Integrating such a large amount of a volatile asset into a corporate balance sheet requires careful management and a robust understanding of market dynamics. However, the benefits could be substantial. For Dogecoin, this investment could: Spur Development: Increased institutional interest might encourage more development on the Dogecoin blockchain, focusing on utility and functionality beyond its meme status. Attract New Investors: Retail investors often follow institutional trends. Cleancore’s move could attract a new wave of investors who see this as a signal of Dogecoin’s maturity. Influence Price Action: While not guaranteed, significant buying pressure from a major entity could positively influence DOGE’s price trajectory in the long term, provided the company continues its acquisition strategy. However, the crypto market remains inherently unpredictable. Cleancore’s strategy will need to navigate regulatory changes, market sentiment shifts, and the ongoing evolution of the digital asset space. The success of this ambitious plan will be closely watched by the entire industry. What Does This Cleancore DOGE Purchase Mean for Institutional Crypto Investment? The Cleancore DOGE purchase serves as a fascinating case study in the evolving landscape of corporate crypto strategy. It signals a willingness among some traditional companies to embrace assets beyond the established giants like Bitcoin. This bold move by Cleancore Solutions could very well set a precedent, encouraging other firms to diversify their digital asset portfolios and explore less conventional cryptocurrencies. As the lines between traditional finance and decentralized finance continue to blur, such acquisitions demonstrate a clear trend towards mainstream integration. Investors, both retail and institutional, should pay close attention to how these developments unfold, as they could reshape the future of digital asset valuation and adoption. Furthermore, this move highlights a growing confidence in the long-term viability of various digital assets. In conclusion, Cleancore Solutions’ initial $68 million Cleancore DOGE purchase marks a significant milestone for both the company and Dogecoin. It underscores a growing institutional confidence in cryptocurrencies, even those with unique origins. This strategic move could pave the way for increased legitimacy, market stability, and broader adoption for Dogecoin, while also challenging conventional perceptions of value in the digital asset space. The journey to acquire 5% of DOGE’s total supply is just beginning, and its implications will undoubtedly resonate throughout the crypto market for years to come.

This isn’t just any stablecoin; it’s poised to become a cornerstone of the Hyperliquid ecosystem, and some of the biggest names in crypto are vying for the privilege. If you’re invested in the future of decentralized exchanges and stablecoin innovation, this story is for you. Sky’s Ambitious Proposal for Hyperliquid USDH Stablecoin Rune Christensen, the visionary founder of Sky (formerly known as MakerDAO), recently ignited this competition with a bold announcement on X. Sky is officially entering the race to issue the native Hyperliquid USDH stablecoin for the innovative decentralized exchange, Hyperliquid (HYPE). This move signals a significant strategic pivot for Sky and could reshape the future of stablecoin issuance within DeFi. Christensen’s proposal is designed to be highly attractive to the Hyperliquid community. Here’s what Sky is bringing to the table: Generous Yield: A Sky-issued USDH would offer a compelling 4.85% annual yield when deposited on Hyperliquid. This is a significant incentive for users. HYPE Token Buybacks: All proceeds generated from this yield are earmarked for direct buybacks of the HYPE token. This mechanism aims to benefit existing HYPE holders by potentially increasing the token’s value. Substantial Support: Sky plans to back Hyperliquid Genesis Star, a key DeFi project, with a substantial $25 million in USDH. This demonstrates a deep commitment to the Hyperliquid ecosystem. Why is Sky Betting Big on the Hyperliquid USDH Stablecoin? Sky’s decision isn’t just about issuing another stablecoin; it’s a strategic alignment with a rapidly growing DeFi platform. Christensen emphasized that a Sky-issued Hyperliquid USDH stablecoin would inherit the robust security and battle-tested infrastructure of the Sky protocol. This means users would benefit from a stablecoin backed by years of proven resilience and stability in the crypto space, enhancing trust and adoption. Moreover, Sky intends to migrate its own token buyback system to Hyperliquid. This strategic integration is designed to significantly enhance HYPE’s liquidity, creating a deeper and more efficient market for the token. This symbiotic relationship could create a powerful synergy between two major DeFi players, driving mutual growth and innovation. The Fierce Competition: Who Else Wants to Issue USDH? Sky isn’t alone in recognizing the immense potential of the Hyperliquid USDH stablecoin . The competition for issuance rights is fierce, attracting several other prominent contenders. These include established giants and innovative newcomers, each bringing their unique strengths to the table: Paxos: A regulated stablecoin issuer known for its compliance, auditing, and reliability within traditional financial frameworks. Frax Finance: A leading algorithmic stablecoin protocol with a strong presence in DeFi, known for its innovative approach to stablecoin design. Agora: A promising DeFi startup looking to make its mark in the stablecoin landscape, potentially offering a fresh perspective. This diverse lineup underscores the significance of Hyperliquid’s native stablecoin and the perceived value of becoming its issuer. The ultimate decision will likely hinge on factors such as security, yield generation mechanisms, community integration, and overall ecosystem benefits. What Does This Mean for Hyperliquid and the Broader DeFi Ecosystem? The successful issuance of the Hyperliquid USDH stablecoin by any of these contenders will be a game-changer for Hyperliquid. A native, high-yield stablecoin could significantly boost user adoption, increase trading volume, and strengthen the platform’s overall liquidity. This enhanced liquidity is crucial for any decentralized exchange to offer better trading experiences and deeper markets for its users. For the broader DeFi ecosystem, this competition highlights a growing trend: established protocols are actively seeking to integrate and collaborate with innovative platforms to expand their reach and utility. This development also emphasizes the ongoing evolution of stablecoins beyond simple price stability. Protocols are now leveraging stablecoins as tools for: Yield Generation: Offering attractive returns to users, making stablecoins more than just a store of value. Ecosystem Growth: Providing native liquidity and direct support for specific platforms, fostering stronger communities. Strategic Partnerships: Forging alliances between major DeFi players, leading to more integrated and robust financial systems. The battle to issue Hyperliquid’s native Hyperliquid USDH stablecoin is more than just a competition; it’s a testament to the dynamic innovation within decentralized finance. Sky’s compelling offer, combining attractive yields, robust security, and strategic buybacks, positions it as a formidable contender. However, with strong rivals like Paxos, Frax Finance, and Agora also in the running, the outcome remains keenly anticipated. Regardless of who ultimately wins, Hyperliquid and its community stand to gain significantly from this exciting development, promising a more liquid, secure, and rewarding experience. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the Hyperliquid USDH stablecoin? The Hyperliquid USDH stablecoin is the proposed native stablecoin for the decentralized exchange Hyperliquid.

51419674,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=803006,1757378748,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51419674.jpeg,Ex-WhatsApp security chief files suit over privacy failures at Meta,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ex-whatsapp-security-chief-files-suit/,"A former Meta employee has filed a lawsuit accusing the company of allowing “systemic cybersecurity failures” at WhatsApp that put user privacy at risk. The complaint, filed Monday in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, comes from Attaullah Baig, WhatsApp’s former head of security. Baig alleges Meta retaliated against him after he raised concerns, including those directly to CEO Mark Zuckerberg, about serious flaws in the messaging app. Ex-WhatsApp security chief claims Meta ignored privacy risks The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleges that after joining WhatsApp in 2021, Baig uncovered security flaws that breached federal securities laws and Meta’s obligations under a 2020 Federal Trade Commission (FTC) privacy settlement . The case emerges against the backdrop of Meta’s broader legal battles, including its recent request for a U.S. federal judge to dismiss the FTC’s antitrust suit. That case accuses Meta of unlawfully consolidating power in the social media market by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. In its defence, Meta argues the FTC has failed to provide sufficient evidence that the deals were anticompetitive or harmful to consumers. The company contends that Instagram and WhatsApp have thrived under its ownership, benefiting from significant investments, improved security, and enhanced features. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan , Meta also rejects the FTC’s narrow market definition, pointing out that platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Reddit compete directly for users’ attention. In the current case, Baig claimed that in a security test with Meta’s central team, he found that about 1,500 WhatsApp engineers had unrestricted access to sensitive user data and could move or steal it without detection or audit logs. Meta disputed Baig’s allegations in a statement and sought to downplay his position and responsibilities. “Sadly this is a familiar playbook in which a former employee is dismissed for poor performance and then goes public with distorted claims that misrepresent the ongoing hard work of our team,” the spokesperson wrote. “Security is an adversarial space, and we pride ourselves in building on our strong record of protecting people’s privacy.” Whistleblower group Psst.org represents Baig alongside the law firm Schonbrun, Seplow, Harris, Hoffman & Zeldes. While the lawsuit does not allege that user data was directly compromised, it claims Baig repeatedly warned his superiors that WhatsApp’s cybersecurity shortcomings created serious regulatory compliance risks. The issues cited are the platform’s lack of a 24-hour security operations center appropriate for its size, inadequate systems to track employee access to user data, and the absence of a comprehensive inventory of data-storing systems, making proper protection and regulatory disclosure impossible. Baig’s attorneys argue in the lawsuit that his superiors repeatedly criticized his work and that he began receiving “negative performance feedback” just three days after his initial cybersecurity disclosure. Late last year, Baig informed the SEC of the alleged “cybersecurity deficiencies and failure to inform investors about material cybersecurity risks,” the suit says. A month later, Baig sent Zuckerberg the second of two letters, informing the CEO that he “had filed the SEC complaint” and was “requesting immediate action to address both the underlying compliance failures and the unlawful retaliation.” Meta denies allegations, calling the lawsuit a “distorted” attack on its record In January, according to the lawsuit, Baig filed a complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, noting “the systemic retaliation” he alleged he received after the security disclosures. The next month, the complaint says Meta dismissed Baig, citing “poor performance”. This occurred during the company’s February layoffs, which affected 5% of its workforce. The lawsuit argues that the timing and circumstances of Baig’s termination show a clear link to his protected activity. It came soon after his external regulatory filings, capping over two years of alleged systemic retaliation over his cybersecurity disclosures and pushing for compliance with federal law and regulatory orders. Baig’s attorneys said he filed a notice on Monday to move his SEC-related claims to federal court and had already exhausted all administrative remedies before pursuing the case.

Dunamu CEO Oh Kyung-seok recently made a pivotal announcement that could reshape digital finance in the region. On September 9th, Oh revealed that Dunamu, the operator of the major South Korean crypto exchange Upbit, plans to support a won-backed stablecoin through its innovative proprietary Layer 2 chain, Giwa. This development marks a significant step towards integrating digital assets more deeply into the traditional financial system, promising stability and accessibility for users. What Does a Won-Backed Stablecoin Mean for South Korea? For those new to the concept, a stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value. Unlike volatile assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins are typically pegged to a reserve asset, such as fiat currency (like the US dollar or, in this case, the South Korean Won), gold, or other cryptocurrencies. The introduction of a won-backed stablecoin is particularly impactful for South Korea. It offers a digital asset that mirrors the value of the South Korean Won, providing a stable medium for transactions and savings in the crypto space. This stability can reduce risks associated with price fluctuations, making digital payments and remittances more predictable. Moreover, it paves the way for greater regulatory clarity and acceptance within the domestic market, fostering trust among both institutional and retail users. Giwa Chain: The Backbone of South Korea’s New Won-Backed Stablecoin ? At the heart of this initiative is Giwa, Dunamu’s proprietary OP Stack-based Layer 2 chain. CEO Oh Kyung-seok highlighted Giwa’s design as “finance-friendly” during the USDC 2025 event, emphasizing its robust architecture built for stable operations. A Layer 2 solution like Giwa is crucial because it helps scale blockchain networks, offering faster and cheaper transactions compared to Layer 1 blockchains. This technical foundation is essential for supporting a high-volume, stable digital currency. Giwa’s design is not just about speed and cost; it’s also about reliability. The chain’s stability is directly linked to the extensive operational experience Dunamu has gained from running Upbit, one of the largest and most reliable crypto exchanges in South Korea. This deep understanding of market dynamics and user needs positions Giwa as a strong contender to facilitate the stable issuance and distribution of the won-backed stablecoin . The Power of Upbit’s Expertise and KYC Integration for the Won-Backed Stablecoin Dunamu’s decision to leverage its existing infrastructure and expertise from Upbit is a strategic move. Upbit’s long-standing operation in the South Korean market, coupled with its experience in managing staking services, provides a solid bedrock for Giwa. This operational prowess ensures that the stablecoin will be issued and distributed reliably and securely within the country. The expertise gained from managing a high-volume exchange is invaluable for maintaining the integrity and stability of a digital asset like a stablecoin. A critical aspect mentioned by CEO Oh is the potential integration of Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures. If required by regulations, Giwa could seamlessly utilize the existing KYC information of Upbit users. This capability offers several advantages: Streamlined Onboarding: New users would likely experience a smoother onboarding process, as their identities are already verified. Enhanced Security: Leveraging established KYC protocols strengthens the overall security framework, combating illicit activities. Regulatory Compliance: It positions the won-backed stablecoin for easier compliance with financial regulations, a key factor for widespread adoption. What’s Next for the Won-Backed Stablecoin and Giwa? The announcement signals Dunamu’s ambition to be a frontrunner in the evolving digital finance landscape. By providing a stable, regulated, and widely accessible digital currency, they are not only catering to the existing crypto community but also opening doors for broader mainstream adoption. The success of this initiative could set a precedent for other nations considering their own fiat-backed digital currencies. While the exact launch timeline and specific regulatory frameworks are yet to be fully detailed, the vision is clear: to create a secure and efficient digital financial ecosystem in South Korea. The won-backed stablecoin on Giwa chain has the potential to transform how South Koreans interact with digital money, offering a blend of traditional financial stability with blockchain innovation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a won-backed stablecoin? A1: A won-backed stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to the South Korean Won (KRW). This means one stablecoin unit is designed to always be worth one South Korean Won, providing price stability. Q2: What is Giwa chain? A2: Giwa chain is Dunamu’s proprietary Layer 2 blockchain built on the OP Stack. It’s designed to be “finance-friendly” and aims to provide a stable and efficient platform for digital assets, including the new won-backed stablecoin. Q3: How does Upbit’s expertise contribute to this project? A3: Dunamu, the operator of Upbit, leverages its extensive experience in running a major crypto exchange and its staking services to ensure the stable operation of the Giwa chain and the secure issuance and distribution of the stablecoin. Upbit’s existing KYC information could also be utilized for regulatory compliance. Q4: What are the main benefits of a won-backed stablecoin? A4: The main benefits include price stability (reducing volatility risks), potential for faster and cheaper transactions, enhanced regulatory clarity, and greater trust and adoption within the South Korean financial market. Q5: When is the won-backed stablecoin expected to launch? A5: While Dunamu CEO Oh Kyung-seok announced the intention to support a won-backed stablecoin, specific launch timelines and regulatory details are yet to be fully disclosed. The announcement indicates a strategic direction for the future. Q6: Will existing Upbit users automatically have access to the won-backed stablecoin? A6: The announcement mentioned that if KYC procedures are required, Giwa could easily leverage existing Upbit user KYC information. This suggests a potential for streamlined access for Upbit users, but specific access mechanisms will be detailed closer to launch.

The Altcoin Season Index is a crucial barometer, offering insights into whether smaller cryptocurrencies are outshining Bitcoin. Currently, this vital index stands at 52, a figure that has held steady from yesterday, providing a moment for investors to assess the landscape. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index: A Key Metric What exactly is the Altcoin Season Index , and why should you pay attention? Developed by CoinMarketCap, this index offers a clear snapshot of the broader altcoin market’s health relative to Bitcoin. It’s not just a random number; it’s a carefully calculated metric designed to help you understand market cycles. Here’s how it works: The index tracks the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Stablecoins and wrapped coins are excluded to ensure a true representation of market sentiment. An ‘altcoin season’ is officially declared when 75% of these top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day period. A score closer to 100 signals a strong altcoin season, indicating that altcoins are broadly performing better than Bitcoin. Conversely, a lower score suggests Bitcoin dominance. Why the Altcoin Season Index at 52 Matters A reading of 52 for the Altcoin Season Index places us in a neutral zone. It means we are neither in a full-blown altcoin season nor a period of overwhelming Bitcoin dominance. This steady state can be interpreted in several ways: Balanced Market: There’s a relatively even performance between altcoins and Bitcoin, suggesting a period of consolidation or indecision. Opportunity for Selection: While the broader market isn’t showing a strong altcoin trend, individual altcoins may still be performing exceptionally well. This requires careful research and selection. Anticipation: A steady index often precedes a shift. It could be building momentum for an altcoin surge or signaling a potential return to Bitcoin’s lead. For investors, this neutral reading underscores the importance of a diversified and well-researched portfolio. It’s a time to observe and strategize, rather than make hasty decisions based on broad market sentiment. Navigating Market Dynamics with the Altcoin Season Index Understanding the implications of the Altcoin Season Index can significantly influence your investment approach. When the index is high, investors might consider rebalancing their portfolios to capitalize on altcoin growth. Conversely, a low index might prompt a shift towards Bitcoin or stable assets. However, challenges persist in this dynamic market: Volatility: Both Bitcoin and altcoins are known for their price swings, which can quickly change the index’s reading. Information Overload: Sifting through hundreds of altcoins to find the next big performer requires dedication and due diligence. Market Psychology: Fear of missing out (FOMO) can lead to poor investment decisions, especially during perceived altcoin rallies. By using the Altcoin Season Index as a guide, you can make more informed decisions, reducing emotional trading and focusing on data-driven strategies. It’s a tool to complement your research, not replace it. Actionable Insights from the Altcoin Season Index So, what should you do when the Altcoin Season Index is at 52? Here are some actionable insights: Deep Dive into Fundamentals: This is an excellent time to research individual altcoins with strong use cases, solid development teams, and active communities. Monitor Bitcoin Dominance: Keep an eye on Bitcoin’s market capitalization dominance. A decline in BTC dominance often precedes an altcoin rally. Consider Risk Management: In a neutral market, re-evaluate your risk exposure. Diversify across different sectors within crypto, not just different coins. Stay Informed: Market conditions can change rapidly. Regularly check the index and other market indicators to adapt your strategy. The index serves as a reminder that the crypto market is cyclical. Periods of altcoin outperformance often follow periods of Bitcoin strength, and vice-versa. Being prepared for these shifts is key to long-term success. Conclusion: Your Guide to Crypto Market Cycles The current standing of the Altcoin Season Index at 52 offers a valuable perspective on the crypto market. It signals a balanced environment, urging investors to remain vigilant, conduct thorough research, and adapt their strategies to evolving conditions. While not a definitive buy or sell signal, it serves as an excellent compass, helping you navigate the complex world of cryptocurrencies and make more strategic investment choices. Stay informed, stay analytical, and be ready for what comes next. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does an Altcoin Season Index of 52 mean? A1: An index of 52 indicates a neutral market. It means that roughly half of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days, suggesting neither a strong altcoin season nor a period of dominant Bitcoin performance. Q2: How is the Altcoin Season Index calculated? A2: The index is calculated by CoinMarketCap. It compares the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) against Bitcoin over the preceding 90-day period. An altcoin season is declared if 75% of these altcoins outperform Bitcoin. Q3: Should I invest in altcoins when the Altcoin Season Index is at 52? A3: A reading of 52 suggests a balanced market. It’s a good time for careful research into individual altcoins with strong fundamentals, rather than broad market-wide altcoin investments. Diversification and risk management are particularly important. Q4: What typically happens after the Altcoin Season Index holds steady at a neutral level? A4: A steady neutral index can precede a shift in market dominance. It could lead to a renewed altcoin season if conditions become favorable, or a return to Bitcoin dominance. It’s a period of observation and strategic planning for potential future movements. Q5: Does the Altcoin Season Index predict future prices? A5: The Altcoin Season Index is an indicator of past performance and current market sentiment, not a direct predictor of future prices. It helps investors understand market cycles and make informed decisions, but it should be used in conjunction with other research and analysis tools. Enjoyed this insight into the crypto market?

The new lending protocol has been performing wonderfully with its fast and cheap method of collateralized lending, with investors stunned at copious additions in the face of a changing crypto environment. While Ethereum is still the leader in the smart contract market, Mutuum Finance’s innovative low-cost on-chain lending platform and growing ecosystem have investors waiting eagerly for what comes next. Ethereum Still at Substantial Levels As DeFi Highlight Intensifies Ethereum (ETH) $4,308.85 oscillates between intraday lows of $4,269.20 and intraday highs of $4,430.67. The asset continues to have in its favor a smart contract platform with consistent institutional inflow and deep network usage. Analysts continue to say that staying above the $4,300 level is important if it is to keep this current trend going with a potential breakout above $4,500 to hit some more resistance levels sooner or later. Meanwhile, new decentralized finance platforms like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are already drawing even greater attention towards the market. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Stage 6 Ongoing Mutuum Finance is already in presale stage 6 and currently selling the tokens at $0.035, which is 16.17% higher compared to the last stage. The market is heavily interested with more than 16120 invested investors and nearly $15.45 million already raised. In a bid to enhance the platform’s security, there has also been the creation of a USDT Bug Bounty Program with and in partnership with CertiK and worth up to a sum of $50,000 USDT. The bugs fall under categories of critical, major, minor, and low according to the program. Mutuum Finance asset collateralisation caps are essentially risk type inherent in the asset, i.e., supply, borrow, and collateral caps. The protocol is thereby hedging market risk by overcollateralising and also incentivising liquidators to liquidate undercollateralised positions. Borrow caps and deposit caps also cap risk exposure to risky or liquid assets and insolvency risk, respectively. Collateral usage cap on risky tokens can be very low, and the correlated assets will be collateral effective.

Among them is veteran trader and self-described market psychologist Michael XBT, who recently posted a brief but attention-grabbing message on X. He advised followers to “watch XRP this week,” offering no further public details. The statement arrives at a time when XRP is down 9.63% on the monthly chart, fueling speculation that a rebound may be near. Michael’s forecasts carry weight because of his history of accurate calls, which has led many investors to treat his updates with caution but also anticipation. Watch XRP this week. That’s all I’m going to say publicly. My group members know why… — Crypto Michael (@MichaelXBT) September 7, 2025 History of Accurate Predictions Michael XBT has previously delivered bold projections that later proved correct. In mid-2024, when XRP was valued at $0.50, he suggested the token was on the verge of breaking free from a multi-year consolidation pattern. Within months, XRP surged to $3.40 by January 2025, a gain of nearly 600%, validating his analysis. Since that rally, the asset has largely traded above $2, cooling after the rapid climb. Michael has consistently framed this consolidation as a necessary adjustment rather than a sign of weakness. He has also argued that XRP’s next major move would likely coincide with a broader Bitcoin breakout, and his latest comments suggest that alignment could be approaching. Technical and Fundamental Alignment Other market commentators share his optimism. Analyst Davie Satoshi recently highlighted an Elliott Wave formation on XRP’s monthly chart, which indicates that the asset may be entering Wave III, historically the strongest phase of the cycle. Similarly, analyst Dark Defender has argued that XRP has finished its corrective Wave IV and could advance toward $4.50, provided the $2.85 support level holds. At present, XRP trades at $2.97, reflecting a 3.3% daily increase. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 EGRAG, another well-followed analyst, has pointed to XRP’s position above the 21-day exponential moving average as a sign of strength. He outlined short-term price targets near $3.90 and suggested that a much larger move could eventually push the token as high as $46 . Davie Satoshi, meanwhile, projected a potential range of $8 to $30, citing both technical and fundamental factors. Fundamental drivers identified by analysts include Ripple’s acquisition of Rail Financial, the introduction of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, global adoption of the ISO 20022 standard, and exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications involving XRP. These developments are viewed as complementary to the bullish technical outlook. Market Sentiment and Whale Activity Large investors also appear to be positioning for a possible move. Analyst Ripple Van Winkle reported evidence of significant whale accumulation during recent dips below $2.70, which he interprets as a strong support signal. In addition, forecasts generated by artificial intelligence models such as ChatGPT and Grok have shown favorable outlooks for XRP, further reinforcing market confidence. The convergence of technical signals, historical precedent, whale accumulation, and ongoing fundamental developments has heightened expectations for XRP in the near term. While market conditions remain fluid, analysts widely agree that this week could provide key signals for the token’s next direction.

51421055,576492,1757379638,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51421055.jpeg,AI Models Predict Neutral Bitcoin Trend: Warns Of Late-September Shock,https://bitcoinist.com/ai-models-predict-neutral-bitcoin-trend-september/,"Bitcoin is currently in a consolidation phase after a strong multi-month uptrend that began in April. Following weeks of heightened volatility and selling pressure, BTC has managed to hold steady above critical support levels, keeping the broader bullish narrative alive. Some analysts argue that this resilience highlights the strength of Bitcoin’s current market structure and even suggest that a push beyond all-time highs could be on the horizon in the coming weeks. Despite uncertainty and cautious sentiment, long-term holders and institutional flows continue to provide a foundation for Bitcoin’s price stability. While short-term corrections remain possible, the broader market remains optimistic that BTC is preparing for another leg higher. CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Onchain recently shared a Bitcoin TFT AI Forecast, which points to BTC trading in a mostly neutral range for the next month. According to the model, Bitcoin is likely to stay around current levels without a sharp breakout or collapse in the near term. This reinforces the idea that the market is digesting its recent gains before attempting another move. Bitcoin AI Forecast Suggests Rising Uncertainty According to the Temporal Fusion Transformer ( TFT ) AI Forecast, Bitcoin is expected to trade within a mostly neutral range in the coming weeks, though uncertainty is rising sharply. The model places Bitcoin’s current price at $110,669, projecting a 1.1% decline to $109,451 over the next seven days. Looking further ahead, the 30-day forecast anticipates a 1.72% decrease to $108,771, reinforcing the idea of consolidation rather than a clear bullish or bearish breakout. The most important signal, however, is not the modest downside forecast, but the sharp opening of confidence intervals. Model uncertainty climbs above 50% by the end of the forecast period, signaling elevated risk and the potential for severe volatility. This uncertainty opens the door to multiple scenarios. The main scenario, combining both the WaveNet and TFT models, suggests Bitcoin will hold within the $108,000–$120,000 channel, a range-bound movement likely to dominate the first three weeks of September. A surprise scenario, however, could emerge in the final week. If a strong catalyst or sudden sentiment shift occurs, the elevated uncertainty could translate into an explosive move—either a breakout to fresh highs or a sharp retrace. While the market faces slight selling pressure short term, the last week of September may prove decisive, with volatility set to define Bitcoin’s next big move. Testing Support Within Ongoing Consolidation The 3-day Bitcoin chart shows BTC trading at $112,146, rebounding 1.77% after recent volatility. The price remains in a consolidation phase following the rejection from the all-time high near $124,500. Notably, Bitcoin has so far defended the $110,000 support zone, which has acted as a floor during recent pullbacks. The moving averages highlight the structure: the 50-day SMA at $107,765 and the 100-day SMA at $100,647 provide strong medium-term support. Meanwhile, the 200-day SMA at $81,576 remains far below, reflecting Bitcoin’s broader bullish cycle despite short-term weakness. Holding above the 50-day average is key for confirming the resilience of this uptrend. Immediate resistance lies at $115,000, a level Bitcoin failed to reclaim in its last attempts. A successful breakout above this region could open the path toward $120,000–123,000, where the ATH sits. Conversely, failure to maintain $110,000 could trigger further downside, potentially targeting the $107,000–105,000 range.

Cardano Is Breaking Out Of A Falling Wedge Pattern In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a technical analysis (TA) pattern forming in the 4-hour price of Cardano. The pattern in question is a “Falling Wedge,” which belongs to the broader class of Wedges. Related Reading: Old Bitcoin Supply Keeps Moving Into ETFs: Data Shows Three Waves So far Wedges form whenever an asset travels between two converging trendlines. When the lines are sloped upward, the formation is known as a Rising Wedge. Similarly, price action to the downside creates a Falling Wedge. Wedges sound similar to Triangles, which also involve converging trendlines, but the key difference between the two is that Triangles are consolidation patterns, while Wedges involve some net movement up or down. Just like with Triangles, though, the trendlines of the channel act as support/resistance barriers for the price. Also, a breakout of either of these bounds can imply a continuation of the trend in that direction. Generally, Wedges are considered more likely to lead to reversals. A Falling Wedge may see the price eventually break past the upper line, while a Rising Wedge could end with a breakdown of support. Cardano has recently been moving inside a channel similar to a Falling Wedge. Below is the chart shared by Martinez, showcasing the formation. At the time the analyst posted the graph, Cardano was beginning to show signs of a surge beyond the resistance line of this Falling Wedge. The breakout attempt came as the asset was closing in on the convergence point of the trendlines. Near the apex of such patterns, price action occurs inside a tight range, so breakouts can become more likely. This could be what was developing for ADA at the time. Martinez noted in the post that the cryptocurrency must break past $0.84 to confirm the bullish breakout. Since then, ADA has surged further, reaching the $0.85 level. Thus, it’s possible that a sustainable break could really be kicking off for the coin, at least if the Falling Wedge is anything to go by. Related Reading: Safe Haven Split: Bitcoin-Gold Correlation Turns Negative For First Time In 6 Months While Cardano is witnessing this Falling Wedge, fellow altcoin Solana has been traveling inside a Rising Wedge instead, as pointed out by the analyst in an earlier X post. As displayed in the chart, Solana has been trading inside this Rising Wedge for a few months now and is slowly inching toward the end of it. If the pattern is going to be a reversal one, then a bearish breakout may be coming for SOL. ADA Price At the time of writing, Cardano is floating around $0.851, up almost 4% over the last seven days.

ADA is trying to push higher toward $1.20 and beyond, while HBAR is holding near $0.24 with mixed signals. Some analysts expect a rally toward $0.30, while others warn of a slide back to $0.16. While both projects remain active, the center of attention has tilted toward BlockDAG . Its presale is generating headlines with whales flipping the leaderboard and millions of dollars flowing in. Batch 30 sits at $0.0013, and the project has already raised nearly $400 million while selling 25.9 billion coins. Many are now asking the same question: is BlockDAG the best crypto to buy now before listings? BlockDAG’s Whale Wars Heat Up BlockDAG’s presale has become a spectacle of competition, where whales are battling for dominance. Recent entries of $4.4M and $4.3M have overtaken earlier leaders, pushing previous $3.8M buys further down the ranks. Every leaderboard shift creates a rush among retail buyers, who don’t want to be left behind. At Batch 30’s $0.0013 price, the numbers are stacking up fast. More than nearly $400 million has already been raised, with 25.9 billion BDAG coins sold. For early participants who entered at $0.001. Momentum is set to rise further with the BDAG Deployment Event, partnered with Coinstore, in Singapore. This milestone will focus on strengthening BlockDAG’s technology, expanding its community presence, and signaling readiness for adoption on a global scale. It’s a step that combines exposure with tangible achievements, reinforcing long-term confidence. Beyond speculation, adoption numbers are impressive. More than 3 million users are already mining BDAG through the X1 mobile app, while hardware sales have crossed 19,594 miners, generating $7.8M in revenue. The ecosystem is also expanding with 300+ dApps and 4,500 developers contributing. With confirmed listings on MEXC, BitMart, and LBank, plus talks underway with Coinbase and Gemini, liquidity is essentially guaranteed. This combination of whale battles, retail FOMO, and ecosystem progress explains why BlockDAG is gaining recognition as the best crypto to buy now. Cardano (ADA) Price Target Updates Cardano continues to attract attention with technical setups pointing toward fresh gains. The short-term Cardano (ADA) price target sits around $0.8050, with bullish momentum building after ADA broke resistance at $0.91. Analysts are highlighting potential moves toward $1.20–$1.90 if momentum holds, supported by whale accumulation of nearly 200 million ADA. Added speculation about ETF products tied to ADA has lifted optimism further. For the long term, forecasts diverge. Some technical models, including Gann Square projections, suggest possible targets between $6 and $11 if the market enters a strong bullish cycle. More moderate outlooks expect a climb into the $1.20–$1.50 zone by the end of the year. For 2025, broader Cardano (ADA) price targets cluster between $2 and $4.83, depending on adoption growth in DeFi and NFTs. With ADA trading near $0.84, the setup is attractive but risky. If resistance levels fail, bearish retracements could drag it back to the $0.19–$0.20 support zone. That uncertainty is why some traders are diversifying into projects with clearer near-term upside, such as BlockDAG’s presale. Hedera (HBAR) Price Trend Outlook Hedera is trading near $0.24, consolidating after a series of pullbacks. The Hedera (HBAR) price trend is one of the most debated in the market today. Technical charts show a head-and-shoulders pattern that could lead to a 30% drop, sending HBAR toward $0.16. Other bearish scenarios suggest a softer retracement toward $0.19. Indicators like RSI and MACD are also flashing caution, hinting at continued selling pressure. Still, not all signals are negative. On the bullish side, chart watchers see a flag pattern that could take HBAR back toward $0.30 if momentum picks up. Recoveries from support zones have kept some optimism alive, particularly with institutional developments like SWIFT trials and new investment vehicles. For traders, the pivot remains $0.24. A sustained break above this level opens the door to a move higher, while a failure risks deeper corrections. The split outlook makes HBAR an uncertain choice compared to the clearer momentum seen in BlockDAG. Why BlockDAG Is the Best Crypto to Buy Now Cardano is building confidence with bullish price targets, while Hedera is balancing between bearish risks and possible recoveries. Both projects have potential, but neither is matching the scale of BlockDAG’s presale. With nearly $400M raised, 25.9B coins sold, BlockDAG has turned its presale into one of the biggest stories in crypto. Whale buys worth $4.4M and $4.3M have reset the leaderboard, while millions of retail buyers follow the action closely. At $0.0013 in Batch 30, the presale still offers upside before the confirmed $0.05 listing price. The ecosystem adds further weight to the case. Millions mining on the X1 app, nearly 20K hardware miners shipped, and a deep developer pipeline prove the project isn’t only about presale hype. Exchange listings on major platforms are locked in and ensure massive exposure to global audiences. For those deciding what crypto to buy now, BlockDAG is standing out as the clearest opportunity. It combines momentum, adoption, liquidity plans, and bonus-driven upside in a way ADA and HBAR currently can’t match.

A significant development has emerged from the U.S. House of Representatives with the introduction of a new bill, HR 5166. This legislation aims to formally address how the federal government will store and manage its strategic Bitcoin reserves , signaling a pivotal shift in how digital assets are perceived at a national level. Why are Strategic Bitcoin Reserves Important? This bill, if it passes, represents more than just a procedural step. It is a clear indication that the U.S. government is seriously considering Bitcoin reserves and other digital assets as vital components of its national strategic assets. Such a move could have profound implications for economic stability, national security, and the future of financial policy. Diversification: Holding digital assets like Bitcoin could offer a new form of reserve diversification, moving beyond traditional gold and foreign currency holdings. Economic Leadership: By developing a clear strategy, the U.S. could position itself as a leader in the digital asset space, influencing global standards and practices. Future-Proofing: As the global economy increasingly digitizes, having a robust framework for managing digital assets prepares the nation for future financial landscapes. The very act of introducing such a bill underscores the growing recognition of Bitcoin’s permanence and potential utility beyond speculative trading. What Does HR 5166 Mandate for Bitcoin Reserves? The core of HR 5166 is straightforward: it mandates a concrete plan. Specifically, the bill requires the Secretary of the Treasury to develop and report a comprehensive digital asset custody plan. This plan must be presented to relevant House and Senate committees within 90 days of the bill becoming law. This timeline highlights the urgency and importance attached to establishing clear guidelines for the management of potential Bitcoin reserves . The report is expected to detail: Secure storage solutions for digital assets. Protocols for managing access and transactions. Risk mitigation strategies against volatility and cyber threats. Regulatory frameworks necessary for oversight. Essentially, the bill pushes for a proactive approach to integrating digital assets into national financial strategy, rather than a reactive one. Navigating the Challenges of Managing Digital Assets While the benefits of strategic Bitcoin reserves are compelling, the challenges are equally significant. Managing such reserves involves navigating complex issues that are unique to digital assets. These include: Security: Protecting large holdings of Bitcoin from cyberattacks, hacks, and unauthorized access requires state-of-the-art security infrastructure and protocols. Volatility: Bitcoin’s price fluctuations can be substantial, necessitating sophisticated risk management strategies to safeguard the value of national holdings. Regulatory Clarity: The digital asset space is still evolving, and clear regulatory guidelines are essential for responsible management and to prevent market manipulation. The Treasury’s plan will undoubtedly need to address these hurdles comprehensively, ensuring that any move towards stockpiling digital assets is both secure and fiscally sound. What’s Next for the Strategic Bitcoin Reserves Bill? The journey for HR 5166 is still underway. Having been introduced, the bill has now been referred to the full House for consideration. This means it will undergo further debate, potential amendments, and eventually a vote. If it passes the House, it would then move to the Senate for their review and approval before potentially being signed into law by the President. This legislative process is crucial, as it allows for thorough scrutiny and ensures that all aspects of managing strategic Bitcoin reserves are carefully evaluated. The outcome will set a precedent for how governments worldwide might approach digital assets in the future. A Bold Step Towards Digital Asset Integration In conclusion, the introduction of HR 5166 marks a bold and crucial step for the United States in formally acknowledging and planning for the management of strategic Bitcoin reserves . It signals a maturation of the digital asset space and its increasing relevance to national policy. While challenges remain, the mandate for a comprehensive plan demonstrates a commitment to understanding and harnessing the potential of cryptocurrencies as national assets. This legislation could pave the way for a more integrated and forward-thinking approach to finance in the digital age, leaving a lasting impression on how nations view and manage their wealth. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is HR 5166? HR 5166 is a bill introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives that mandates the Secretary of the Treasury to draft a plan for managing the federal government’s strategic Bitcoin reserves and other digital assets. Why would the U.S. government hold Bitcoin reserves? The U.S. government might hold Bitcoin reserves for several reasons, including diversifying national assets, establishing leadership in the digital economy, and preparing for future financial landscapes where digital assets play a significant role. Who is responsible for drafting this digital asset custody plan? The Secretary of the Treasury is responsible for drafting the digital asset custody plan and reporting it to relevant House and Senate committees within 90 days of the bill’s passage. What are the main challenges in managing strategic Bitcoin reserves? Key challenges include ensuring robust security against cyber threats, managing the inherent volatility of Bitcoin, and establishing clear regulatory frameworks for oversight and responsible management. What are the next steps for HR 5166? After its introduction, HR 5166 has been referred to the full House for consideration. It will undergo debate, potential amendments, and a vote before potentially moving to the Senate for further review and approval.

His goal was to entice them with promises of lucrative, high-return cryptocurrency investments, only to siphon off their hard-earned funds for himself. Victim Deception: The perpetrator skillfully built a façade of legitimacy, convincing numerous victims to transfer their money into what they believed were legitimate investment vehicles. Rapid Digital Conversion: Once acquired, the illicit funds were swiftly converted into USDT (Tether), a popular stablecoin. This conversion was a key step in the crypto laundering process, designed to obscure the money’s origins and make it significantly harder for authorities to trace. Massive Scale of Fraud: The operation successfully laundered an astonishing $37 million. This substantial figure underscores the significant financial impact and the broad reach of such sophisticated digital asset frauds. This detailed account provides a chilling look into the methods employed by criminals in the digital age, emphasizing the constant need for user vigilance. Why is Crypto Laundering a Growing Global Concern? The incident underscores a critical and evolving issue in the global digital economy: the persistent misuse of cryptocurrencies for illegal activities. While the underlying blockchain technology offers unprecedented transparency and immutability, bad actors relentlessly seek innovative ways to obscure their tracks and exploit perceived loopholes. The inherent characteristics of cryptocurrencies—such as the ease of cross-border transactions, the speed of transfers, and the potential for pseudo-anonymity—can unfortunately make them attractive tools for money launderers and other criminals. However, it is crucial to recognize that law enforcement agencies and financial intelligence units worldwide are becoming increasingly sophisticated in their methods for tracking, investigating, and prosecuting these complex digital crimes. This particular sentencing serves as a powerful and unambiguous deterrent, unequivocally demonstrating that illicit financial activities, even those conducted entirely within the digital asset space, will not go unpunished. The global effort to combat crypto laundering is intensifying, with significant resources being dedicated to tracing illicit flows. What Are the Far-Reaching Ramifications of Such Crypto Laundering Cases? The 51-month prison sentence handed down to the California man sends a clear, resounding message about the legal system’s unwavering commitment to combating financial crime in the digital realm. Such high-profile convictions have several profound and far-reaching ramifications, impacting victims, regulators, and the broader cryptocurrency industry: Justice for Victims: While full financial recovery is not always guaranteed, these legal actions are vital for providing a measure of justice and closure for those who suffered significant financial losses. They also deter future criminal activity. Enhanced Regulatory Scrutiny: Cases like this invariably spur further discussions, reviews, and the development of more robust cryptocurrency regulations. The aim is to create a safer, more compliant, and more trustworthy environment for all legitimate users and innovators within the digital asset space. Building Industry Trust: By actively identifying, apprehending, and prosecuting bad actors involved in crypto laundering , the cryptocurrency industry can gradually build greater trust with the public, traditional financial institutions, and governments. This is absolutely crucial for achieving wider mainstream adoption and fostering responsible innovation. This case emphatically highlights the critical importance of conducting thorough due diligence for anyone considering engaging with cryptocurrency platforms or individuals offering investment opportunities. Always verify legitimacy, research extensively, and remain highly skeptical of promises that seem too good to be true. Protecting yourself in this dynamic landscape is paramount. Protecting Yourself: Actionable Insights Against Crypto Laundering Scams To navigate the crypto world safely and avoid falling victim to similar scams or inadvertently participating in illicit activities, consider these actionable insights: Research Thoroughly: Before investing in any crypto project or platform, conduct extensive research. Check reviews, team backgrounds, and project whitepapers. Be Skeptical of High Returns: If an investment promises unusually high, guaranteed returns with little to no risk, it’s almost certainly a scam. Verify Identity: Always verify the identity of individuals offering investment advice or soliciting funds. Be cautious of unsolicited messages or calls. Use Reputable Exchanges: Stick to well-known, regulated cryptocurrency exchanges that have strong security protocols and comply with AML (Anti-Money Laundering) and KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements. Secure Your Wallets: Use strong, unique passwords, enable two-factor authentication (2FA), and consider hardware wallets for significant holdings. Report Suspicious Activity: If you encounter suspicious activity or believe you’ve been targeted by a scam, report it to the relevant authorities immediately. In conclusion, the sentencing of the California man for his central role in a $37 million crypto laundering scheme is a landmark event, signaling a new era of accountability in the digital asset space. It powerfully illustrates the unwavering commitment of federal prosecutors and global law enforcement to combating financial crime within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This case serves as a vital reminder for both potential criminals and everyday users: the digital world is not a lawless frontier. Vigilance, robust security practices, and strict adherence to legal and ethical frameworks are absolutely paramount for fostering a secure, trustworthy, and ultimately prosperous digital future. The ongoing fight against crypto laundering is intensifying, but justice is increasingly catching up with those who seek to exploit the system for illicit gain. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is crypto laundering? Crypto laundering refers to the process of concealing the origins of illegally obtained funds by converting them into cryptocurrencies, then moving them through various digital wallets and exchanges to make them appear legitimate. Q2: How was the California man able to launder $37 million? He gained victims’ trust through messages and phone calls, posing as an investment opportunity. Once funds were received, he converted them into USDT to obscure their source, effectively laundering the money. Q3: What is USDT and why is it used in crypto laundering? USDT (Tether) is a stablecoin, meaning its value is pegged to the U.S. dollar. It’s often used in illicit activities because it offers liquidity and can be moved quickly across borders, making it a convenient tool for criminals to convert and transfer large sums while attempting to evade detection. Q4: What are the penalties for crypto laundering? Penalties for crypto laundering can be severe, including lengthy prison sentences, substantial fines, and forfeiture of assets. The specific punishment depends on the amount laundered, the jurisdiction, and the specifics of the crime, as evidenced by the 51-month sentence in this case. Q5: How can individuals protect themselves from crypto investment scams? Always conduct thorough research on any investment opportunity, be wary of promises of guaranteed high returns, verify the identity of those soliciting funds, use reputable and regulated exchanges, and enable strong security measures like two-factor authentication on your accounts. If it seems too good to be true, it likely is. This case serves as a critical reminder of the ongoing fight against digital financial crime.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Crypto traders remain cautious ahead of Thursday’s U.S. CPI report, with BTC trading flat above $111,600, and ETH at $4,298. The CD20 , a measure of the performance of the largest digital assets, is trading above 4,000, up 1.6%. The August Nonfarm Payrolls miss , just 22,000 jobs added versus expectations of 75,000, pushed futures higher and dragged 2-year Treasury yields to year-lows as markets priced in 72 bps of cuts this year. Yet crypto remains rangebound, diverging from broader risk sentiment. Options markets confirm the defensive stance. QCP Capital noted in its recent Asia Market Update that risk reversals are increasingly skewed toward puts, with short-dated implied vols elevated into CPI. Polymarket data backs this positioning: ETH carries a 70% chance of staying above $4,600 this month but only 13% odds of breaking $5,600. Traders are bracing for turbulence, not chasing upside. SOL is the outlier , with odds of a new all-time high before 2026 rising sharply, signaling improving breadth beneath the surface. In a note to CoinDesk, market maker Enflux argues that the SEC’s forward-looking rules for token sales and listings, combined with the steady march of institutions like Coinbase into major indices, show how deeply crypto is embedding into the system. This is the “split-screen reality” of 2025: speculation dominates headlines, while adoption rails are being laid in the background. The legitimacy narrative also played out in real time on Friday. Michael Saylor’s Strategy was left out of the S&P 500 despite meeting all criteria, while Robinhood was unexpectedly included instead, sending its stock up 7% and underscoring that crypto-adjacent firms with diversified business lines may reach blue-chip status faster than pure treasury plays. WLFI’s turmoil illustrates the speculative side of the split-screen. The protocol froze over 270 wallets, including Justin Sun’s, to “protect users” after phishing-related compromises. ""On one side, speculative narratives like WLFI risk cannibalizing themselves through governance drama,"" Enflux wrote in its note. ""On the other hand, institutional-grade infrastructure and regulation are solidifying at a pace that suggests the rails for mainstream adoption are being laid faster than most expect."" Onchain data shows Sun’s transfers came hours after WLFI’s crash , which was instead driven by shorting and dumping across exchanges. Yet the freeze rattled whales and market makers – shocked that the free market of crypto could be broken by protocol governance fiat – with insiders asking: “If they can do it to Sun, who’s next?”. The takeaway: near-term volatility and governance drama may cap upside, but the deeper story is that crypto’s institutional and regulatory foundations are hardening. ""Structural legitimacy, not speculation, remains the real story of 2025,"" Enflux continued. For traders, that means bracing for CPI noise; for investors, it means the legitimacy story continues to build. Market Movement: BTC: Bitcoin is holding steady above $111K, with support from consolidation near key resistance levels and solid on‑chain support zones. Analysts suggest this stability could pave the way for a breakout, though some caution about a possible pullback toward $100K exists ETH: Ethereum’s price has eased slightly intraday, trading around $4.3K. This movement may reflect broader crypto market dynamics, including relatively subdued demand and positioning around current technical levels. Gold: Gold has surged to fresh record highs, recently hitting ~$3,636/oz, as expectations of U.S. interest rate cuts rise amid weak labor data, a soft U.S. dollar, geopolitical concerns, and continued central bank demand. Nikkei 225: Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.9% to a record high and the Topix gained 0.52% as investors bet a new LDP leader could deliver fresh fiscal stimulus following Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’s resignation. S&P 500: U.S. stocks edged higher Monday, with the S&P 500 up 0.2%, as investors awaited inflation data to gauge the likelihood of a jumbo Fed rate cut next week.

Arthur Hayes, the visionary co-founder of BitMEX, has just made a substantial ENA purchase , injecting over $1 million into the Ethena ecosystem. This isn’t just another transaction; it’s a statement that has caught the attention of investors and analysts alike. Understanding the Astounding ENA Purchase Details surrounding this major acquisition highlight its strategic nature. Reports from EmberCN confirm that Hayes acquired a staggering 1.395 million ENA tokens. This equates to approximately $1.01 million at the time of purchase. He executed this impressive ENA purchase through two prominent platforms: Binance and Flowdesk. The average price per token stood at a notable $0.73. Such a large-scale investment from a figure of Hayes’ stature often signals confidence in a project’s future. It prompts a closer look at the Ethena protocol and the potential trajectory of its native token, ENA. Who is Arthur Hayes and Why Does His ENA Purchase Matter? Arthur Hayes is not just any investor; he is a highly influential voice in the crypto space. As the co-founder and former CEO of BitMEX, one of the earliest and largest cryptocurrency derivatives exchanges, his insights and actions carry significant weight. His market commentary and investment decisions are closely watched by a global audience. Therefore, his recent ENA purchase is more than just a personal investment; it’s often interpreted as a bullish signal for the asset. Market Influence: Hayes’ public endorsements or investments can sway market sentiment. Strategic Acumen: Known for his deep understanding of market mechanics and macroeconomics. Early Adopter: Often identifies promising projects before they reach mainstream attention. What is the Ethena Protocol and Its ENA Token? To fully grasp the significance of Hayes’ investment, it’s essential to understand Ethena. The Ethena protocol is an innovative synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum. It aims to provide a censorship-resistant, scalable, and stable cryptocurrency solution. Its core offering is USDe, a synthetic dollar that maintains its peg through delta hedging staked Ethereum and Bitcoin. The ENA token, on the other hand, is the native governance token of the Ethena protocol. Holders of ENA can participate in the decentralized governance of the protocol. This includes voting on key decisions that shape its future development and operational parameters. A major ENA purchase by an influential figure like Hayes naturally brings more eyes to the protocol’s underlying technology and vision. Potential Implications of This Major ENA Purchase Hayes’ substantial investment could have several ripple effects across the crypto market, particularly for ENA. Firstly, it could generate increased interest and demand for the token. This heightened visibility might attract new investors who see his move as a vote of confidence. Secondly, it validates Ethena’s model in the eyes of many. An expert like Hayes putting significant capital into the project suggests he sees genuine value and potential for growth. However, it is crucial to remember that while influential endorsements can be positive, market dynamics are complex. Investors should always conduct their own research before making investment decisions. This ENA purchase serves as a strong indicator, but it doesn’t guarantee future performance. Arthur Hayes’ $1 million ENA purchase is undoubtedly a pivotal moment for the Ethena protocol and its community. It underscores the growing interest in innovative synthetic dollar solutions and the power of influential figures in the crypto landscape. As the market continues to evolve, keeping an eye on such strategic investments can offer valuable insights into emerging trends and potential future leaders in the decentralized finance space.

On September 10, lawmakers are set to confirm Fed nominee Stephen Miran , a decision that could send significant ripples through the economy. For those tracking the cryptocurrency markets, understanding the Federal Reserve’s composition and leadership is absolutely crucial. A new voice on the Fed’s board can influence monetary policy, which in turn impacts everything from interest rates to investor sentiment, and ultimately, the value of digital assets. Who is Fed Nominee Stephen Miran , and Why Does This Appointment Matter? Stephen Miran, currently serving as the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), has been tapped by President Trump to fill a key vacancy on the Federal Reserve’s board. His nomination is more than just a procedural step; it represents a potential shift in the nuanced balance of economic perspectives within the Fed. The Federal Reserve plays an unparalleled role in shaping the nation’s economic landscape. Its decisions on interest rates, inflation targets, and quantitative easing directly affect credit availability, consumer spending, and investment flows. Therefore, the individuals who sit on its board wield immense power. What Role Does a Fed Nominee Play in Monetary Policy? Each governor on the Federal Reserve Board contributes to the formulation of monetary policy. They participate in the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings, where critical decisions about interest rates and the money supply are made. These decisions are the bedrock of economic stability and growth. A new governor, like Fed nominee Stephen Miran , brings their own economic philosophy and insights to these discussions. Their views can influence the collective direction of the Fed, potentially leading to adjustments in how the central bank approaches inflation, employment, and financial stability. This ripple effect is felt across all asset classes, including the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. The Senate’s Role: Confirming Fed Nominee Stephen Miran The U.S. Senate’s confirmation process is a critical check and balance. Senators scrutinize a nominee’s background, qualifications, and economic views through hearings and debates. This ensures that only qualified individuals are entrusted with such significant responsibilities. The vote on September 10 will determine if Miran joins the ranks of the Fed governors. A successful confirmation would immediately add his perspective to the central bank’s deliberations. Conversely, a rejection would necessitate a new nomination, potentially delaying crucial policy discussions. Potential Economic Ripple Effects and Crypto Implications of Fed Nominee Stephen Miran What could Miran’s confirmation mean for the broader economy and, specifically, for digital assets? Here are some key considerations: Monetary Policy Direction: Depending on Miran’s specific economic leanings, his presence could subtly shift the Fed’s stance on inflation or interest rates. A more hawkish approach (favoring higher rates to combat inflation) might strengthen the dollar but could put downward pressure on risk assets like crypto. Inflation Outlook: If Miran’s views align with a more aggressive approach to managing inflation, this could influence market expectations. Lower inflation expectations might reduce the appeal of assets like Bitcoin as an inflation hedge. Investor Sentiment: Clarity and stability in central bank leadership often reassure markets. The successful confirmation of Fed nominee Stephen Miran could provide this, potentially fostering a more predictable environment for investors, which generally benefits all markets. It’s important to remember that the Fed operates as a committee. While individual governors are influential, decisions are made collectively. However, each new voice contributes to the overall consensus. The upcoming Senate vote on Fed nominee Stephen Miran is a significant event on the financial calendar. His potential addition to the Federal Reserve Board carries implications that extend far beyond Washington D.C., reaching into the daily lives of consumers and the volatile world of digital finance. Staying informed about such appointments is essential for anyone seeking to understand the underlying currents shaping our economic future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Federal Reserve’s primary role? The Federal Reserve, often called the Fed, is the central bank of the United States. Its primary roles include conducting the nation’s monetary policy, supervising and regulating banking institutions, maintaining the stability of the financial system, and providing financial services to depository institutions. Why is a Fed governor’s appointment important for the economy? A Fed governor’s appointment is crucial because they participate in setting monetary policy, including decisions on interest rates and the money supply. These decisions directly impact economic growth, inflation, employment, and the overall stability of financial markets. How might a new Fed governor impact cryptocurrency markets? A new Fed governor can indirectly impact cryptocurrency markets by influencing broader monetary policy. For example, changes in interest rate policy or the Fed’s stance on inflation can affect the attractiveness of risk assets like cryptocurrencies compared to traditional investments. What is the White House Council of Economic Advisers (CEA)? The White House Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) is a group of three leading economists who advise the President of the United States on economic policy. They conduct objective economic research and analysis to help shape the administration’s economic agenda. What happens if the Senate rejects a Fed nominee? If the Senate rejects a Fed nominee, the position remains vacant. The President would then need to nominate a different candidate to fill the role, restarting the confirmation process. This can lead to delays in having a full complement of governors on the Federal Reserve Board. Did this article help you understand the significance of the upcoming Fed nominee Stephen Miran vote?

This development comes as Microsoft beat Wall Street expectations, posting quarterly earnings of $3.65 per share and revenue of $76.44 billion, above the projected $73.89 billion. Its Intelligent Cloud unit brought in $29.88 billion, also surpassing forecasts. Because Microsoft’s fiscal year ends in June, this quarter closed out its FY2025 rather than the calendar year’s second quarter. Nebius powers Microsoft’s AI growth Nebius will also grant Microsoft access to dedicated GPU clusters via a future data center it is building in Vineland, New Jersey. The t iming of the deal is key. As companies race to develop and deploy generative AI, the demand for computing power has soared. Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI requires huge infrastructure for training ever-bigger models and delivering AI services to its customers over Azure. GPU global supply chains are still in short supply. Nvidia, the leading maker of chips used in AI, can’t make things fast enough. This shortfall has led big technology companies to seek alternative solutions for guaranteed capacity. This deal also ensures Microsoft gets a secure source of GPUs that don’t have to come through traditional channels. It also means hardware bottlenecks won’t set back its AI research teams and enterprise customers. To some extent, the agreement is also about strategic diversification, the experts said. Microsoft is mitigating the risks by not putting all of its trust in just Nvidia and a handful of hardware manufacturing partners. This reduces risk and increases resilience in its infrastructure planning. Analysts said the move would provide a big lift to Microsoft in its battle with others in the race for so-called artificial intelligence supremacy. Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud also pour billions into AI data centers and custom chips. Now that they have added this GPU capacity, they can continue to differentiate themselves in the race to provide reliable and scalable AI services on the industry’s best infrastructure. Finally, the collaboration sets Microsoft up to grow its Azure global AI footprint, while offering Nebius an opportunity to demonstrate its infrastructure at scale. Deal fuels Nebius’s future Nebius, on the other hand, sees the deal as transformative. The Amsterdam company, spun out of the Russian tech company Yandex in 2024, is rapidly emerging as a player in the world of global AI infrastructure. Nebius CEO Arkady Volozh said the agreement demonstrated the company’s ability to compete with established giants. It was the first of several long-term deals planned with leading technology firms. Nebius intends to fund the new infrastructure underneath the deal through a combination of cash flow from the Microsoft deal and debt backed by the contract. The firm is also considering other sources of funding to fuel growth. Nebius stock soared more than 60% in early trading on the news. Investors greeted the deal as indicating strong interest in Nebius’s AI cloud services. The contract also ensures Nebius of a steady revenue stream for years. That stability will let it grow its global footprint, invest in more data centers, and strengthen its cloud play for AI. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

This action addresses the recent rising concerns about regulations in the digital assets ecosystem and suggests suitable updates to the commission’s rules. Notably, this public roundtable on financial surveillance and privacy marks the sixth roundtable to be held addressing rising issues in the digital assets sector since Gary Gensler, a former chairman of the US SEC, withdrew from his position. According to an SEC notice released on September 8, the roundtable is scheduled for October 17. In a statement, Peirce mentioned, “Learning about new developments in tools that protect privacy will help the SEC and other financial regulators as we work on policy solutions in the crypto area.” The US SEC proposes amendments to its crypto rules Roundtables focusing on the crypto ecosystem are part of a series of 10 meetings that are taking place from August through December across the US. This event comes when the US SEC considers proposed amendments to its crypto rules , which could significantly impact market players. On Thursday, 4 September, the commission made public its suggestion to implement certain exemptions and safe harbors in the provision and sale of crypto assets and its intentions to enhance broker-dealer financial responsibility rules. According to them, these measures will ease requirements for crypto firms operating in the US. Since January, this action of loosening regulations and enforcement measures has been popular among the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the main financial regulators in the US. This has affected crypto firms as the commissions have withdrawn several investigations and lawsuits. During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump emphasized that his administration would adopt a friendlier stance toward cryptocurrency, signaling reduced hostility from the highest levels of government—a position he has largely maintained. Under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, known for his strict regulatory approach, the crypto community often felt constrained. His departure sparked significant anticipation, and while Gensler is now out of the picture, the SEC remains active and appears poised for a busy and evolving regulatory future. A new proposed law sparks hope for a new turn in the US financial regulators’ policies The two regulators, the SEC and the CFTC, have vowed to work together to monitor and provide support to spot crypto trading. Additionally, they have reportedly stated that they would look into having capital markets operating 24/7 and establishing regulations, particularly for crypto derivatives. Their decision aligns with a suggestion from President Donald Trump in July’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets. Moreover, it is worth noting that the CFTC is currently under the leadership of only Acting Chair Caroline Pham, who, earlier in August, stated that the commission would strictly adhere to the White House’s direction put in place on crypto policy. Despite the SEC and CFTC’s decisions aligning with the US President Donald Trump’s policies, hope for a new turn in authority and responsibility for the two regulators has been sparked with a new proposed law. The law is currently being discussed in Congress. Concerning the above situation, Senator Cynthia Lummis, a strong supporter of this legislation, weighed in on the topic of discussion. According to Lummis, the Responsible Financial Innovation Act, the Senate’s version of a digital asset market structure bill, could become law by 2026. The upcoming meetings show the SEC’s transition from the regulation-by-enforcement era led by the Gary Gensler administration. It intends to work in union with various industry participants to gather insights and feedback on digital assets regulations. Also, it shows a willingness to be more collaborative and a desire to make the industry an overall better place.

51421913,576510,1757383201,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png,"Bitcoin Core Censorship Could Trigger Full-Scale Fork, Ordinals Leader Warns",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-core-censorship-trigger-fork/,"A leading figure in the Bitcoin Ordinals movement has threatened to bankroll an alternative version of the reference Bitcoin software if Bitcoin Core tightens default relay policy to the detriment of Ordinals and Runes transactions. In an “open letter to Bitcoin Core” posted on September 6, Leonidas — host of The Ordinal Show and a prominent organizer in the inscriptions ecosystem — warned that “any serious attempt by Bitcoin Core to tighten policy rules or censor Ordinals and Runes transactions will be met with decisive action.” He said that, if necessary, “the DOG Army will fund the development and maintenance of an open source fork of Bitcoin Core that strips out nearly all policy rules,” adding that thousands would run it “to make it abundantly clear that Bitcoin is and must always remain censorship resistant.” Leonidas framed the dispute as one over the base-layer neutrality. He argued that the Ordinals/Runes economy is not freeloading, claiming it has “contributed over half a billion dollars in transaction fees to strengthen Bitcoin’s security,” and asserted he has spoken “directly with miners and mining pools representing more than 50% of Bitcoin’s total hash rate,” who, he said, will accept any consensus-valid transactions with competitive fees if the process is straightforward. Bitcoin Core Vs. Knots The post lands amid intensifying debate over mempool policy vs. consensus and ahead of Bitcoin Core’s next major release . The pushback from “monetary-maximalist” voices has been equally blunt. Blockstream CEO Adam Back reiterated that “Bitcoin is owned by humanity, the protocol developers are stewards, and need consensus from users to change it materially,” adding that “bitcoin is about money, spam has no place in the timechain,” and that the Core client’s defaults therefore matter. In parallel comments, Back has questioned whether peer-to-peer filters even work in practice to curb the activity inscriptions critics call “spam.” Luke Dashjr, maintainer of the Knots implementation and a lead advocate of stricter default policy , insists the posture is not censorship. “No, filters are not censorship,” he wrote in a fresh exchange — a line consistent with his years-long position that nodes may, and often should, apply relay filters, while miners remain free to include any consensus-valid transaction that pays sufficient fees. Dashjr has continued to argue for stronger default limits and has encouraged operators who prefer stricter policy to run Knots. Bitcoin is not a finished product. We may be on a detour to address spam, and part of the crisis did originate with (mishandling of) the Segwit and Taproot upgrades – but to improve the world, we still need more functionality. Stopping all improvements forever (“ossifying”) is… — Luke Dashjr (@LukeDashjr) September 8, 2025 At the center of the dispute is Bitcoin Core v30, scheduled for October, and specifically a set of policy changes merged in June that widen the “standardness” aperture for data-carrying transactions. Core v30 will remove the long-standing default 80-byte cap on OP_RETURN payloads (making the effective cap the block size limit) and, crucially, will begin relaying transactions with multiple OP_RETURN outputs by default — changes to mempool relay policy, not to consensus rules. Proponents say aligning policy with what miners actually include improves fee estimation, reduces reliance on out-of-band submission, and corrects perverse incentives that pushed data into the UTXO set; critics see it as normalizing non-monetary use of block space. Core developers have publicly articulated where they draw the line. In a June 6 statement, signatories including Pieter Wuille, Gloria Zhao, Greg Sanders and others wrote that Core aims to “make our software work as efficiently and reliably as possible” for validating and relaying transactions and blocks, and that transaction-relay policy should not “block … transactions that have sustained economic demand and reliably make it into blocks.” They warned that knowingly refusing to relay such transactions pushes users into alternative submission channels and undermines decentralization — while stressing this is not an endorsement of non-financial data, merely an acceptance that a censorship-resistant system will be used for things “not everyone agrees on.” Leonidas, for his part, rejected any normalization of content-based filtering: “There is no meaningful difference between normalizing the censorship of JPEG or memecoin transactions and normalizing the censorship of certain monetary transactions by nation-states. Both would set very dangerous precedents.” He also claimed that “over twenty Bitcoin startups that operate economically relevant nodes … would welcome the expanded design space” if nodes were required only to follow consensus rules rather than “arbitrary policy restrictions.” The governance backdrop matters. Bitcoin Core is not Bitcoin, and users choose which software to run — a point both sides invoke. In practical terms, the market is already voting with its node software: according to Coin.Dance, Knots has gained huge momentum and now accounts for 4,373 of 23,729 publicly reachable nodes — just over 18% — up sharply in recent months as the relay-policy fight has intensified.

This collaboration aims to establish a new Solana treasury. $1.65 Billion PIPE Offering To Establish Solana Treasury In a revelation made earlier on Monday, Forward Industries (FORD) disclosed its plans for a private investment in public equity (PIPE) offering, with commitments totaling $1.65 billion in cash and stablecoins. This offering is being spearheaded by crypto-focused investment manager Galaxy Digital, Jump Crypto, and Multicoin Capital, all of which will provide vital capital for the new treasury fund. Financial advisor C/M Capital Partners will also participate in this venture. By leveraging the expertise and resources of Galaxy Digital, Jump Crypto, and Multicoin, Forward Industries aims to generate increased on-chain returns and enhance long-term shareholder value through active participation in Solana’s growth. Related Reading: Dogecoin Leads Altcoin Rally Amid ETF Speculation: Is $1.50 the Next Big Target? Michael Pruitt, CEO of Forward Industries, expressed his view about the initiative, stating, “Our strategy to build an active Solana treasury program underscores our conviction in the long-term potential of SOL and our commitment to building shareholder value by directly participating in its growth.” As part of this initiative, Kyle Samani, co-founder and Managing Partner of Multicoin, is expected to assume the role of Chairman of the Board of Directors upon the closing of the PIPE. Samani, who has been a long advocate of the Solana protocol, believes that the platform is often “misunderstood and undervalued,” stating: Real economic value is being generated on Solana. An institutional-scale treasury can be deployed in sophisticated ways within the Solana ecosystem to create differentiated value and increase SOL per share at a faster rate than simply being a passive holder.” Galaxy’s President and Chief Investment Officer, Chris Ferraro, along with Saurabh Sharma, Chief Investment Officer at Jump Crypto, are also anticipated to join as Board observers. SOL Strategies Set For Nasdaq Debut Mike Novogratz, Founder and CEO of Galaxy, expressed confidence in the initiative, stating that with the leadership of Samani, Ferraro, and Sharma, Forward Industries is poised to distinguish itself as a leading publicly traded entity within the SOL ecosystem. Jump Crypto’s Sharma echoed this sentiment, expressing excitement about Forward Industries’ strategy centered on Solana. He emphasized the opportunity to offer investors access to innovative on-chain return sources that extend beyond traditional staking, leveraging Solana’s advanced decentralized finance ecosystem.

Fidelity’s FETH: In contrast, Fidelity’s product attracted a healthy $75.15 million in net inflows, demonstrating continued investor confidence in this specific offering. Grayscale’s ETH and Mini ETH Products: These funds also experienced positive movement, with inflows of $9.55 million and $11.31 million respectively. These contrasting figures paint a nuanced picture, suggesting that while some funds are facing headwinds, others are still managing to attract capital, perhaps due to differing investor strategies or product specifics. Why Are Spot ETH ETFs Experiencing These Shifts? Understanding the reasons behind these market movements is crucial for any investor. Several factors could be contributing to the recent outflows from Spot ETH ETFs : Market Volatility and Sentiment: The broader cryptocurrency market often experiences periods of heightened volatility. Negative news or general market downturns can lead investors to de-risk and withdraw funds from their holdings, including ETFs. Profit-Taking: It’s possible that some investors who entered these ETFs earlier, when Ethereum’s price was lower, are now choosing to take profits, especially if they perceive the market to be at a temporary peak or if they need to rebalance their portfolios. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies and related investment products like Spot ETH ETFs remains a topic of ongoing debate and evolution in the U.S. and globally. Any perceived tightening or lack of clarity could prompt cautious investors to pull back. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic conditions, such as inflation concerns, interest rate changes, or geopolitical events, can influence investor appetite for riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. When traditional markets face uncertainty, capital sometimes flows out of speculative investments. It’s important to remember that these are often interconnected factors, creating a complex environment where multiple forces are at play simultaneously. What Do These Spot ETH ETFs Outflows Signal for the Future? The consistent outflows, particularly from a major player like BlackRock, prompt us to consider the potential implications. While it’s too early to declare a long-term trend, these movements could indicate a shift in short-term investor sentiment towards Ethereum. For new investors or those looking to adjust their portfolios, these developments offer a critical point of reflection. Here’s what these trends might suggest: Evolving Investor Strategy: Investors might be re-evaluating their exposure to Ethereum through ETFs, possibly opting for direct ownership or other investment vehicles. Market Maturation: As the crypto market matures, institutional products like Spot ETH ETFs are subject to the same supply-and-demand dynamics as traditional financial instruments, leading to periods of both inflows and outflows. Opportunity for Entry? For some, periods of outflows could signal potential buying opportunities if they believe in Ethereum’s long-term value and see current prices as a discount. Ultimately, monitoring these trends closely, alongside broader market analysis, will be key to making informed investment decisions. Conclusion: Navigating the Shifting Tides of Spot ETH ETFs The recent six-day streak of outflows from U.S. Spot ETH ETFs , totaling nearly $97 million, underscores the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. While BlackRock’s significant withdrawals stand out, the inflows into Fidelity and Grayscale products remind us that investor sentiment is not monolithic. These movements are likely influenced by a confluence of market volatility, profit-taking, regulatory concerns, and broader macroeconomic factors. For investors, staying informed and understanding these underlying currents is paramount to navigating the evolving landscape of digital asset investments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Spot ETH ETF? A Spot ETH ETF, or Exchange-Traded Fund, directly holds Ethereum (ETH) as its underlying asset. This allows investors to gain exposure to Ethereum’s price movements without directly buying, storing, or managing the cryptocurrency themselves. Why are Spot ETH ETFs experiencing outflows? Outflows can be attributed to several factors, including market volatility, investors taking profits after price gains, ongoing regulatory uncertainties surrounding cryptocurrencies, and broader macroeconomic conditions that influence risk appetite. Which Spot ETH ETF funds saw inflows during this period? During the recent period of net outflows, Fidelity’s FETH fund attracted $75.15 million in net inflows, while Grayscale’s ETH and Mini ETH products also saw positive inflows of $9.55 million and $11.31 million, respectively. How do these outflows impact Ethereum’s price? Significant outflows from Spot ETH ETFs can exert downward pressure on Ethereum’s price, as it indicates a decrease in demand for ETH through these investment vehicles. However, other market factors also play a crucial role in price determination. Is this a long-term trend for Spot ETH ETFs? It’s challenging to determine if these outflows represent a long-term trend. The cryptocurrency market is highly dynamic. These movements could be a short-term correction, a response to specific market events, or a signal of evolving investor strategies. Continuous monitoring of market data and sentiment is essential.

SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, often dubbed ‘Crypto Mom’ for her progressive stance, has issued a crucial warning: centralized Layer 2 blockchains could soon find themselves under the purview of securities laws. This insight directly addresses the growing discussion around Layer 2 regulation and its profound implications for the future of blockchain scaling solutions. Understanding the SEC’s Stance on Centralized Layer 2s Commissioner Peirce’s remarks, as reported by CryptoSlate, draw a clear line between truly decentralized protocols and those that maintain elements of centralization. She explains that while fully decentralized protocols might navigate free from traditional securities laws, their centralized counterparts face a different reality. Decentralization is Key: Peirce emphasized that the level of control within a protocol is the determining factor. Exchange-Like Operations: If a single entity controls transactions, it starts to resemble a traditional exchange. Intermediary Role: Protocols whose operators act as intermediaries for trades may be required to comply with securities laws, similar to brokers or exchanges. This distinction is vital for understanding the SEC’s perspective. The core concern revolves around investor protection and market integrity, which are central to securities regulation. Why is Layer 2 Regulation a Growing Concern? Layer 2 solutions are designed to enhance the scalability and efficiency of base-layer blockchains like Ethereum. They achieve this by processing transactions off the main chain, then periodically settling them on the Layer 1. However, the pursuit of speed and lower costs can sometimes lead to trade-offs in decentralization. Many Layer 2s, especially in their early stages, might rely on centralized components for various functions, such as sequencers, validators, or upgrade mechanisms. This centralization introduces potential risks: Single Points of Failure: A centralized entity can become a target for attacks or be subject to undue influence. Censorship Risks: Centralized control could lead to the ability to censor transactions or users. Lack of Transparency: The operations of a centralized entity might not be as transparent as a fully decentralized network. The SEC’s focus on Layer 2 regulation stems from these inherent risks. If investors are putting capital into systems that are centrally controlled, they might not have the same protections as they would in a truly decentralized environment. Navigating the Future of Layer 2 Regulation: What’s Next? This warning from Commissioner Peirce serves as a critical call to action for developers and project teams building on Layer 2 solutions. The path forward for many protocols will likely involve a stronger emphasis on progressive decentralization. Projects should consider: Decentralizing Key Components: Moving away from single entities controlling sequencers, proposers, or upgrade paths. Enhancing Transparency: Clearly communicating the degree of decentralization to users and investors. Legal Scrutiny: Proactively assessing their operational structure against existing securities laws. For users and investors, understanding the underlying architecture of the Layer 2s they interact with becomes even more important. A protocol’s claims of decentralization should be met with due diligence, especially in light of potential Layer 2 regulation . The Impact of Potential Layer 2 Regulation on Innovation While the prospect of increased regulation can seem daunting, it also presents an opportunity for the crypto space to mature. Clearer guidelines, even if stringent, can foster greater investor confidence and potentially attract more institutional participation. The challenge lies in balancing regulatory compliance with the innovative spirit that drives blockchain technology. The SEC’s approach indicates a growing understanding of the nuances within the crypto ecosystem, moving beyond a blanket classification. This targeted focus on centralized components within Layer 2s suggests a future where the degree of decentralization will be a key factor in regulatory treatment. Concluding Thoughts on Layer 2 Regulation Commissioner Peirce’s warning is not merely a hypothetical statement; it’s a clear signal of the SEC’s evolving perspective on the rapidly expanding Layer 2 landscape. Projects that prioritize decentralization from their inception, or actively work towards it, will be better positioned to navigate the regulatory currents ahead. This ongoing dialogue between regulators and innovators will ultimately shape a more robust and compliant future for blockchain technology. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is a Layer 2 blockchain? A1: A Layer 2 blockchain is a secondary framework or protocol built on top of an existing blockchain (Layer 1) to improve its scalability and efficiency. It processes transactions off-chain and then settles them back on the main chain. Q2: Why would centralized Layer 2s be regulated as securities? A2: According to SEC Commissioner Peirce, if a Layer 2 protocol is controlled by a single entity and its operators act as intermediaries for trades, it functions similarly to a traditional exchange, thus potentially falling under securities laws designed to protect investors. Q3: How can Layer 2 projects avoid regulatory scrutiny? A3: Projects can aim for progressive decentralization, ensuring that control over key operational aspects is distributed among multiple, independent entities rather than concentrated in a single one. Transparency about their governance structure is also crucial. Q4: Does this mean all Layer 2s are at risk of regulation? A4: No, Commissioner Peirce specifically highlighted centralized Layer 2s. Truly decentralized protocols, where no single entity holds significant control, are less likely to be subject to the same securities regulations. Q5: What should users look for in a Layer 2 protocol? A5: Users should research the decentralization roadmap and current governance structure of a Layer 2. Understanding who controls key functions and how decisions are made can provide insight into its regulatory risk profile. If you found this article insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

But since Musk isn’t saying anything, DOGE’s momentum is slowing down, and retail interest is starting to evaporate. The lesson is plain for many traders: enthusiasm alone can’t keep growth going for a long time, especially in a market where investors are always debating if crypto is a smart investment or just another hype cycle. Analysts are also looking at DeFi systems that have real dynamics that create lasting demand for tokens throughout this time. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one project that is getting a lot of attention right now. Its presale is in Phase 6 and costs $0.035. Some analysts are openly arguing about whether this structured, utility-driven initiative is the kind of crypto investment that can develop at an exponential rate, with some predicting a price near $2 in the future. That would be a 5600% increase from the presale price, which is a level of growth that DOGE can’t reach without its historic hype engine. The stats for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) show that it is gaining traction: it has raised more than $15.5 million, has over 16,200 holders, and 35% of the current phase has already sold out. The presale is moving quickly because Phase 7 will raise the price to $0.040, which means that anybody who waits will miss out on a 15% gain. CertiK’s audit findings, which include a Token Scan score of 95 and a Skynet score of 78, add to its legitimacy. The company also has a strong Twitter community with over 12,000 followers. Investors who got in early at $0.01 are already seeing 3.5x profits on paper. However, those who get in now at $0.035 are still in a good position because the plan sets up continual demand drivers. Why analysts see $2 as realistic for MUTM The story behind Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is based on usefulness, not hype. Dogecoin (DOGE) needs social media buzz to expand, whereas MUTM has built-in features that will keep people using it for a long time. Its interaction with Layer-2 infrastructure is a key feature because it will save a lot of money compared to busy Layer-1 chains. This efficiency should bring in more total value locked (TVL) as more people borrow and lend. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will have a beta platform ready for users to borrow, lend, and use its stablecoin ecosystem when it launches. This means that the project will not launch as a promise but as a working product. This will give traders something useful right away and boost early token demand. The buy-and-distribute cycle makes MUTM’s business even stronger. The money made from borrowing and lending will be utilized to buy back tokens from the open market. This will create a constant buy pressure that raises demand and value. Meme tokens don’t have this kind of feedback loop; they just have speculative waves. The consistent interest rate model is another factor that will make the platform appealing to both institutional investors and borrowers who don’t want to take risks. Predictable charges are very important for getting more people to use the service, and this will keep people using it over time, even when the market goes up and down. For retail traders who are following the news about today’s crypto crisis, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a safer and more profitable crypto investment than other volatile assets since it has built-in resilience. Analysts say that the $2 goal for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is based on a number of factors that affect the price. likely listings on major exchanges, including Coinbase, Binance, KuCoin, and Kraken, are likely to lead to a 10x increase in the price. The project’s stablecoin mechanisms and mtToken staking loop will also encourage more activity, which will pave the way for 20–30x growth. The multiplier effect, along with the perpetual buyback system and treasury revenue compounding, puts $2 on a path that makes it possible, significantly exceeding DOGE’s restricted growth. Conclusion Retail investors already know what the difference is. People who got in during Phase 1 at $0.01 are up 3.5 times, but Phase 6 is still one of the last chances to get in before exchange listings make it harder. MUTM’s structure makes it more than just a hypothesis in the larger conversation about what makes a crypto investment successful. It is a system that is meant to help it grow. As DOGE slows down and people lose interest, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is picking up speed. With presale phases ending rapidly and exchange listings coming up, investors are not questioning if the token will go up, but when it will hit its $2 goal.

Today, the values of popular memecoins are very unstable; therefore, investors are looking for projects that have both utility and good financial mechanics. Increasing numbers of analysts are pointing out that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at $0.035 is a well-structured DeFi platform that will give you consistent returns and be useful in the real world. This token will become an appropriate choice for speculative assets, with a target price of $3.85 to $4.00, which is a realistic 110x from pricing in early Phase 1. Meme coins have a hard time keeping their momentum, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will give both retail and institutional investors a reliable, growth-oriented chance. Crypto forecasts say that utility-based tokens like MUTM will do better than coins that are driven by excitement and volatility. Phase 6 presale has earned $15.5 million, and 35% of the 170 million tokens that were set aside have already been sold. More than 16,200 people are holding them. Investors will feel more confident because CertiK gave Token Scan a score of 95 and Skynet a score of 78. A $100,000 giveaway and a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty program will keep making people feel safe and trust the system. In Phase 7, the price will go up by 15% to $0.040, which will make buyers want to buy tokens at the present lower price before the next milestone. Beta launch, roadmap, and mechanisms supporting 110x growth The beta launch that will happen at the same time as the token listing will let users directly access Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s lending, borrowing, and stablecoin features, which will encourage early adoption and participation. Plan In phases 2 through 4, smart contracts will be finished, the DApp front-end will be finished, preparations will be made for exchange listings, the DApp will be able to work on more than one chain, and partnerships with institutions will be made. These steps will make sure that MUTM’s environment is strong, works well, and is ready for a lot of people to use it. The protocol’s mechanisms will make the high price target seem reasonable. Enhanced Collateral Efficiency (ECE) will let people borrow more money against stable assets. This will lead to more transactions and more fees. The Reserve Factor, which comes from borrower interest, will provide treasury assets that can be used to sustain staking and utility incentives. A strong oracle strategy that uses Chainlink feeds, fallback oracles, and aggregated data will give accurate prices and trustworthy liquidations, which will encourage more people to get involved. Expected listings on big exchanges like Binance, KuCoin, Coinbase, MEXC, and Kraken will make the coin more liquid, more popular, and more visible. The buy-and-distribute mechanism will also use platform revenue to buy back MUTM tokens from the open market and give them to stakers. This will provide a constant buy pressure that will help the price go up. At the current Phase 6 price of $0.035, early Phase 1 investors who traded BTC, ETH, and AVAX for MUTM at $0.01 will see 3.5 times their money back. A baseline of $0.06 will be set after the listing, and beta adoption, Layer-2 integration, and exchange exposure will push the realistic target up to $3.85–$4. With 35% of Phase 6 already sold and the price of Phase 7 about to go up, purchasers who want to take part in a utility-driven DeFi opportunity are feeling a lot of FOMO. When you look at crypto pricing and trends, you’ll see that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has more potential for structural growth than memecoins. Native stablecoin and Layer-2 efficiency for fast dealings Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will have a decentralized stablecoin system that is only created when users borrow against ETH, SOL, or AVAX collateral and is burned when the loan is paid back or the collateral is sold. Governance-controlled interest rates will keep the $1 peg, and arbitrage mechanisms will keep prices stable. The Layer-2 integration will make borrowing and lending much easier by lowering fees and speeding up transactions. These characteristics will make MUTM different from other cryptocurrencies by giving lenders and borrowers a safe, predictable, and scalable framework. The protocol will offer P2C lending for bluechip assets and stablecoins, giving investors predictable APYs. P2P lending, on the other hand, will handle riskier tokens independently to keep the pool’s integrity. On-chain liquidity will make sure that liquidations happen without slippage. The system will be safe with LTV ratios of 75% for stable assets and 35–40% for volatile tokens, and liquidation thresholds between 80% and 65%. The reserve factor, which can be anywhere from 10% to 35%, will help keep the platform solvent while balancing safety and returns. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) @ $0.035 is a good option for investors who want to leave behind unstable tokens. It combines stablecoin innovation, Layer-2 efficiency, staking rewards, and regulated liquidity mechanisms. With Phase 7 price increases, beta acceptance, and major exchange listings coming up, MUTM is set up to offer a long-term, high-growth DeFi opportunity that might give early presale investors a realistic 110x return.

They recently announced a sweeping action, imposing US sanctions crypto scam rings operating out of Myanmar and Cambodia. This crucial intervention targets networks that exploit vulnerable individuals through human trafficking, forcing them into cryptocurrency investment fraud. It’s a stark reminder that the digital world, while offering innovation, also presents new avenues for exploitation, demanding vigilant oversight. What Exactly Happened with the US Sanctions Crypto Scam? The U.S. Treasury Department specifically sanctioned 19 organizations across Myanmar and Cambodia. These entities are accused of orchestrating sophisticated cryptocurrency investment scams. Wu Blockchain reported that these groups coerced victims of human trafficking into carrying out fraudulent activities. The victims were allegedly forced to use messaging apps and text messages to lure unsuspecting individuals into fake investment schemes, highlighting a deeply disturbing intersection of modern finance and severe human rights abuses. Targeted Action: 19 organizations in Myanmar and Cambodia faced these sanctions. Alleged Crime: Cryptocurrency investment scams exploiting digital assets. Victim Exploitation: Human trafficking victims forced into fraudulent operations. Method: Using messaging apps and text messages for scamming. Unmasking the Deceptive Tactics: How These Scams Operated These criminal enterprises preyed on both the victims they trafficked and the unsuspecting investors they targeted. The trafficked individuals, often lured by false promises of legitimate work, found themselves imprisoned and forced to act as “scammers.” They were compelled to build trust with potential investors online, slowly convincing them to invest in fake cryptocurrency platforms. This cruel method involves cultivating long-term relationships before draining victims’ funds. The fraudulent schemes typically promised high returns on crypto investments, often starting with small, seemingly successful transactions to build confidence. Once a significant amount was invested, the criminals would disappear with the funds, leaving both the forced laborers and the defrauded investors in ruin. The US sanctions crypto scam operations aim to disrupt this entire exploitative chain, cutting off their financial lifelines. Why Are These US Sanctions Crypto Scam Actions So Crucial? The Treasury’s move to impose US sanctions crypto scam rings sends a powerful message. It demonstrates a commitment to combating financial crime, especially when it intersects with egregious human rights violations like trafficking. By targeting the financial infrastructure of these groups, the sanctions aim to cut off their funding and disrupt their operations. This action also serves as a critical precedent, showing that governments are increasingly willing and able to pursue illicit activities conducted through digital assets across borders. Furthermore, these sanctions highlight the growing recognition of cryptocurrency’s role in both legitimate finance and illicit activities. They emphasize the importance of robust regulatory frameworks and international collaboration to ensure the integrity of the global financial system. Such measures are vital for protecting consumers and maintaining trust in emerging technologies, making the US sanctions crypto scam a vital step forward. Protecting Yourself: Actionable Insights Against Crypto Scams While authorities like the U.S. Treasury are working to dismantle these networks, individual vigilance remains paramount. The rise of these sophisticated scams means everyone involved in the crypto space must exercise caution. Understanding the red flags can make a significant difference in safeguarding your assets and avoiding falling victim to these predatory schemes. Be Skeptical of High Returns: If an investment promises unusually high, guaranteed returns, it’s likely a scam. Always approach such claims with extreme caution. Verify Identities: Be wary of online relationships that quickly steer towards investment opportunities. Always verify the identity of individuals and the legitimacy of platforms independently. Research Platforms: Thoroughly research any cryptocurrency exchange or investment platform before committing funds. Check for reviews, regulatory compliance, and official contact information. Secure Your Accounts: Use strong, unique passwords and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on all your crypto accounts for enhanced security. Report Suspicious Activity: If you encounter a potential scam, report it to relevant authorities immediately to help protect others. These proactive steps can help protect you from falling victim to the very types of schemes the US sanctions crypto scam initiatives are designed to prevent. The U.S. Treasury’s recent US sanctions crypto scam operations in Myanmar and Cambodia represent a critical step in the ongoing global fight against financial crime and human trafficking. By disrupting the funding and infrastructure of these illicit networks, the action not only protects potential investors but also brings hope to those exploited as forced laborers. It underscores the urgent need for continued vigilance, international cooperation, and robust security practices in the evolving world of cryptocurrency. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What exactly are the US sanctions crypto scam rings? The US sanctions crypto scam rings refer to the 19 organizations in Myanmar and Cambodia that the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned. These groups are accused of running cryptocurrency investment scams and exploiting human trafficking victims. 2. How do these crypto investment scams typically work? These scams often involve coercing human trafficking victims to pose as legitimate investors online. They build trust with targets, convincing them to invest in fake cryptocurrency platforms, promising high returns, and eventually stealing their funds. 3. Who are the primary victims of these scams? There are two main groups of victims: individuals lured into fake cryptocurrency investments and victims of human trafficking who are forced to carry out the fraudulent activities against their will. 4. How can individuals protect themselves from cryptocurrency scams? To protect yourself, always be skeptical of promises of high, guaranteed returns. Thoroughly research any investment platform, verify identities, use strong security measures like 2FA, and report any suspicious activity to authorities. 5. What is the broader impact of these US sanctions? These sanctions aim to disrupt the financial infrastructure of criminal networks, set a precedent for combating crypto-related financial crime, and highlight the importance of international cooperation in protecting human rights and financial integrity.

51425110,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/ethereum-whale-accumulation-hits-record-what-it-means-for-2025-roi/,1757386800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51425110.jpeg,Ethereum Whale Accumulation Hits Record – What It Means for 2025 ROI,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/ethereum-whale-accumulation-hits-record-what-it-means-for-2025-roi/,"Despite the recent market fluctuations, Ethereum still stands as a popular choice among institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals, as large wallets continue to accumulate sizable amounts of ETH. However, these actions are typically signs of confidence in Ethereum’s fundamentals being on firmer ground, rather than speculation based on short-term price movements. Large buyers are positioning for what they see as a key phase of network growth through 2025, when broad ecosystem apps development and scaling could change the blockchain adoption landscape. The accumulation shows that investors believe in Ethereum’s future potential and that those who invest are taking a more balanced approach by putting their funds into smaller but promising projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which could lead to higher returns. Why Ethereum Remains the Altcoin King Ethereum has established the basis for tokenized assets, NFTs, decentralized finance, and a myriad of consumer-facing applications. The subsequent phases of its scaling roadmap are aimed at increasing throughput and reducing costs, making on-chain operations more cost-efficient and faster for everyday users. This is a crucial point, as more transactions continue to be processed by Layer 2 networks, Ethereum’s architecture ensures that value can still be returned to ETH. This is the key for long-term holders: more transactions, more seamless experiences, and an asset that benefits from protocol-level growth. In addition to increased utility, ETH should benefit from the narratives that drive institutional demand if tokenized real-world assets accelerate in adoption, consumer apps see an increase in users, and payments become more widespread. The Early-Stage Play Some investors wish to diversify into higher beta opportunities for maximum upside, and Ethereum provides stability and long-term upside capture. MAGACOIN FINANCE is among the most anticipated presale tokens in 2025. The project is being compared to the early breakout cycles of established altcoins like XRP. Meanwhile, the project has already raised over $13 million in record time. What makes MAGACOIN unique is its staged token supply, increasing community adoption, and milestones. Although access is restricted, analysts predict early backers will be able to get up to 50x returns. As allocations are capped at the token supply, access might be reserved for a small percentage of investors before the token shows up on major exchanges. Demand may exceed supply after that listing, achieving better returns for early investors. MAGACOIN FINANCE is a speculative but potentially groundbreaking addition for investors building upon an Ethereum core. The Importance of Whale Behavior Whales have always played a crucial role in the crypto market. They can accumulate in days of calm mood because they’re patient, are able to research, and have the ability to keep what they have at hand. Their activity does not foretell the price of cryptos in the next week but does tend to foretell macro cycles when adoption and valuation intersect again. Looking further forward to 2025, investors can expect to see Ethereum rollups mature, emerge high-impact use cases, and more institutional adoption. Meanwhile, whales are already betting on these features. Key Metrics to Watch for Ethereum’s Growth There are multiple on-chain signals that investors are closely tracking, including: The Layer 2 network daily active users Cash flows back to validators Growth of tokenized assets and real-world adoption These metrics act as proxies for stability and long-term revenue generating potential of Ethereum. As long as they continue to rise, ETH’s value proposition will only grow stronger. The Road Ahead Ethereum and MAGACOIN FINANCE are two very distinct positions in the crypto ecosystem, but they represent the dual strategies of today’s savviest investors. The reliable foundation is Ethereum, a network that has a track record of adoption, a scaling plan, and value capture mechanisms. However, if its initial momentum turns into long-term growth , MAGACOIN FINANCE is the high-upside play that has the potential to increase returns. Whales are still buying ETH while small investors rush to buy the limited allocation of MAGACOIN. In 2025, new areas of opportunity will open up as existing assets and new competitors fight for a place in the crypto ecosystem. Investors who want to build long-term portfolios may need to find a balance between core exposure and selective speculative bets.

According to the company, that brings its total holdings to 20,136 coins. The purchase keeps Metaplanet among the larger corporate holders of the crypto. Metaplanet Expands Bitcoin Stack The company reported the fresh buy on Monday. Based on reports, Metaplanet now sits as the sixth-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. At the time of the purchase, Bitcoin traded around $111,580, putting the new units close to current market levels. The move underscores how some firms are turning parts of their balance sheets into crypto exposure rather than sticking only to their core businesses. Market Reaction Was Cool Shares of Metaplanet did not climb after the disclosure. They fell 2.3% in Tokyo trade on Monday and were trading near a four-month low, extending nearly a 20% rout from the prior week. Reports show the stock slide has tracked a drop in Bitcoin’s price after profit-taking followed August’s record highs. Investors appear skittish when a company’s share price is tied tightly to a volatile asset. *Metaplanet Acquires Additional 136 $BTC , Total Holdings Reach 20,136 BTC* pic.twitter.com/c41t6bJg1L — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) September 8, 2025 Investors Weigh ETFs Versus Direct Exposure Part of the pushback comes from alternatives. Exchange-traded funds now give retail and institutional investors direct bitcoin exposure without owning a company whose core business may not reflect the crypto bet. Strategy , formerly MicroStrategy, remains the biggest corporate holder with 636,505 coins. Strategy logged nearly a 15% loss in August as Bitcoin pulled back, showing how a firm’s valuation can swing with crypto prices. Questions have been raised about whether holding Bitcoin on a company balance sheet still offers the same appeal it once did. Valuation And Volatility Concerns Persist Metaplanet’s market value — around $5 billion, based on recent trading — has drawn scrutiny because it exceeds the current market value of the bitcoin on its books. Critics warn that tying a company’s shares to Bitcoin can make the stock more vulnerable to crypto’s swings. New players, including Metaplanet and Gamestop, tried to copy the strategy and have met mixed results so far. Market Crowding Could Limit Future Gains Analysts also point to crowding: many companies chasing the same story could blunt future upside for treasury-play stocks if fresh buyers stop showing up. Strategy achieved big gains after late-2023 purchases, funded in part through large share and debt issuances. That path may be harder to repeat now that more investment routes exist. For now, Metaplanet keeps adding to its bitcoin pile while its shares remain under pressure. Reports suggest the next moves by both Bitcoin and markets will decide whether that bet looks smart or risky in hindsight.

However, with the $0.23 resistance in the spotlight, the question remains: Can DOGE clear this hurdle and rekindle its rally momentum? Cloud Turns Support: Kumo Now Shields Bitcoin Price Action In a recent analysis shared on X, crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade provided an updated technical outlook on DOGE’s price action using the Ichimoku indicator. The analysis points to a significant development: a Kumo breakout, which has triggered a long trade signal for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Dogecoin Mega Rally Ahead? Crypto Analyst Says $4 Is In Play The analyst explained that this breakout is a crucial turning point, as the Kumo, or “Cloud,” which previously acted as resistance, is now a key support zone for Dogecoin. Trader Tardigrade also specified the key support and resistance levels for Dogecoin based on the Ichimoku chart. The new support zone is highlighted by the Kumo itself, with a range of $0.21517 to $0.22661. This area is now expected to hold the price during any potential pullbacks. On the other hand, the immediate resistance is identified at $0.23804, which corresponds with the Ichimoku’s Kijun-sen line. A successful breakout above this level would confirm the bullish momentum and could lead to further gains for Dogecoin, according to the analysis. Trend Analysis Based on Trader Tardigrade’s analysis, the various components of the Ichimoku indicator present a mixed picture for Dogecoin’s trend, ultimately resulting in a neutral overall outlook. This complexity is revealed through a point-based system that scores the individual trend signals. Related Reading: Dogecoin Holds Support as Analysts Eye Technical Setup That Could Trigger a $2 Super Rally The first positive signal is the Kumo color, which is green, indicating a bullish bias. This is a key indicator within the Ichimoku system, as a green cloud signals that the faster-moving Senkou Span A is above the slower Senkou Span B, suggesting an upward momentum in the medium to long term. However, the analysis also points to conflicting signals. While the mid-term trend is bullish, with the price remaining above the Kumo, the short-term trend is currently bearish, as the price is trading below the Kijun-sen. In the long term, the trend is also negative. This is indicated by the Chikou Span being below the current price. The Chikou Span, or lagging span, compares the current price to the price 26 periods ago. When it is below the current price, it suggests that the current momentum is weaker than the momentum from a month ago, indicating a potential long-term downtrend. With an overall score of zero after adding up the conflicting signals, the analysis concludes that Dogecoin is currently in a state of consolidation, without a clear directional bias at this time.

Literally. The project’s X10 Miner reviews are now flooding social platforms, showing actual footage of devices being unboxed, installed, and already generating profits. These aren’t simulations or CGI renders. They’re videos, photos, and testimonials from real people in real locations, validating that BlockDAG has moved far beyond speculation and into physical execution. This wave of organic content is painting a powerful picture: BlockDAG is no longer just a whitepaper or a vision. It’s infrastructure that can be touched, plugged in, and monetized. For a presale-backed project, this type of visible, verifiable delivery is virtually unheard of. From Whitepaper to Workstation: X10 Miners in Action Across YouTube, Twitter (X), TikTok, and Telegram, users are showcasing their X10 Miners arriving on doorsteps and firing up within minutes. These plug-and-play devices are now operational in over 130 countries, each producing up to 200 BDAG per day with BlockDAG’s current algorithm and reward model. The reviews are consistent, setup is simple, power usage is modest, and mining has been smooth. This isn’t marketing, it’s user-driven validation. Supporters are actively tagging their content with #BlockDAGX10 , giving future investors and miners a transparent look at the hardware’s functionality. It’s not about hype anymore. It’s about hardware in hand, screens showing earnings, and networks coming online. The strategy has paid off. BlockDAG has now shipped hundreds of X10 units , and the pace is accelerating, with plans to scale to 2,000 shipments per week . This isn’t just a rollout, it’s a movement. One that’s being recorded in real time by the people powering it. While the X10 rollout is capturing headlines, BlockDAG’s mobile initiative is no less impressive. The X1 Mobile Miner , already downloaded by over 3 million users , is expanding global access to BDAG through smartphone devices. A major update is scheduled to hit app stores soon, boosting UI responsiveness, mining efficiency, and energy optimization. Together, the X1 and X10 miners form a dual-track system: mobile users contribute to decentralization and growth, while hardware miners bring stronger hash power and network security. This layered approach isn’t just smart, it’s strategic. It ensures that participation in the ecosystem is never gated by technical skill or income level. Turning Delivery Into Social Proof In the crypto world, trust is earned with results. And BlockDAG has turned hardware shipments into a powerful credibility campaign. Most presale-stage projects are still refining their tokenomics, scrambling for VC money, or teasing unreleased features. BlockDAG, on the other hand, is letting its community do the talking, through unboxing clips, mining dashboards, and live earnings screenshots. For those who have followed crypto since 2017, this approach feels like a reset. The project isn’t just trying to look credible, it is credible. With 3 million users, over 19,000 miners shipped or shipping, and a total raise exceeding $401 million , BlockDAG has effectively crowdsourced its proof of delivery. The phrase “proof of work” has new meaning here, it’s not just a consensus algorithm, it’s the visible output of actual progress. The presale is in its final stretch, with the price locked at $0.0013 per BDAG . Gone are the days of complicated bonus tiers, everyone now gets the same flat, fair rate. This decision not only simplifies entry but also honors the loyalty of early adopters by ensuring a level playing field through the last 30 days. The momentum is peaking. Miner shipments are scaling. Mobile app upgrades are en route. And the highly anticipated BlockDAG Deployment Event in Singapore , hosted in partnership with Coinstore , is just weeks away. This event will officially mark the shift from presale to global deployment, turning BlockDAG from a fast-growing ecosystem into a live, operational network. Conclusion: Visibility Creates Credibility BlockDAG didn’t ask the community to believe, it showed them. Through miner reviews, real-time videos, app stats, and global shipment rollouts, the project has created a visual and operational roadmap of credibility. While others are still teasing features, BlockDAG is powering networks. While most presale coins rely on flashy marketing, BlockDAG leans on real infrastructure and grassroots content. This isn’t a campaign, it’s a transformation. One led by users, proven by hardware, and validated by results. As the final weeks of the presale unfold, the message couldn’t be clearer: BlockDAG is already live, and the future is already mining.

ETH is still struggling and might slide below the $4,270 zone. Ethereum is still struggling to recover above the $4,400 zone. The price is trading below $4,350 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a bullish trend line with support at $4,290 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a strong decline if it settles below the $4,220 level in the near term. Ethereum Price Could Slide Further Ethereum price started a recovery wave after it formed a base above the $4,220 zone, like Bitcoin . ETH price was able to climb above the $4,300 and $4,320 resistance levels before the bears appeared. The price struggled to clear the $4,400 level. A high was formed at $4,383 and the price started to decline again. There was a move below the $4,320 support level. The price dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent increase from the $4,234 swing low to the $4,383 high. Besides, there was a break below a bullish trend line with support at $4,290 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading below $4,320 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $4,320 level. The next key resistance is near the $4,360 level. The first major resistance is near the $4,400 level. A clear move above the $4,400 resistance might send the price toward the $4,440 resistance. An upside break above the $4,440 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $4,500 resistance zone or even $4,550 in the near term. More Downside In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $4,360 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $4,270 level. The first major support sits near the $4,220 zone. A clear move below the $4,220 support might push the price toward the $4,200 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $4,160 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $4,120. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.

The world of cryptocurrency is always buzzing with activity, and a recent event has caught the attention of many: a massive ETH withdrawal . An anonymous address has moved a significant sum of Ethereum from the OKX exchange, prompting discussions about its potential implications for the market. What does this significant move mean for Ethereum and its investors? What Just Happened? A Closer Look at the Massive ETH Withdrawal Recently, an intriguing on-chain transaction unfolded. An anonymous new address, specifically 0xac08, executed a substantial ETH withdrawal . This address pulled 7,777 ETH, valued at an impressive $33.34 million, directly from the OKX exchange. This information comes courtesy of Onchain Lens, a reputable source for tracking blockchain movements. Understanding the significance of such an event requires a bit of context. When cryptocurrencies, especially large sums like this ETH withdrawal , are moved off exchanges, it’s often interpreted as a strategic move by the holder. Instead of being readily available for trading on the exchange, these assets are typically moved to private wallets for long-term holding. Why Do Large ETH Withdrawals Matter? Unpacking Investor Behavior Large-scale withdrawals, such as this recent ETH withdrawal from OKX, are not just random occurrences; they often signal deeper market sentiment or strategic intentions. Here’s why they are closely watched: Reduced Selling Pressure: When ETH leaves an exchange, it’s generally removed from the immediate supply available for sale. This can, in theory, reduce potential selling pressure on the asset. Long-Term Holding Intent: Moving assets to a private, non-custodial wallet often indicates a holder’s intention to keep their assets for an extended period, rather than trading them in the short term. This is a bullish signal for many. Confidence in the Asset: Such a significant move can also reflect a strong belief in Ethereum’s future price appreciation or its fundamental value. Conversely, a large inflow of ETH onto exchanges might suggest an impending sell-off, as more assets become available for trading. Therefore, tracking these movements provides valuable insights into the collective psychology of large holders. What Could This Massive ETH Withdrawal Signify for Ethereum’s Future? The implications of a massive ETH withdrawal like this can be multifaceted, touching upon various aspects of the Ethereum ecosystem and broader crypto market. While no single event dictates the future, it contributes to the larger narrative. Potential for Price Stability: If a significant portion of ETH is moved to cold storage, it could contribute to greater price stability by reducing speculative trading. Increased Scarcity Perception: As more ETH is held off-exchange, the perception of its circulating supply decreases, which can, under certain conditions, positively influence its value. Institutional Interest: Sometimes, such large withdrawals are attributed to institutional players accumulating assets for long-term investment portfolios. While unconfirmed for this specific instance, it’s a common interpretation for large moves. It’s important to remember that the crypto market is highly dynamic. While on-chain data offers valuable clues, it’s one piece of a much larger puzzle. Other factors, including macroeconomic trends, regulatory developments, and technological advancements within Ethereum, also play crucial roles. Navigating the Crypto Landscape: Actionable Insights from an ETH Withdrawal For investors and enthusiasts, understanding these on-chain movements can be a powerful tool. Here are some actionable insights derived from observing events like this significant ETH withdrawal : Stay Informed: Regularly follow reputable on-chain analytics platforms and news sources to keep abreast of major movements. Knowledge is power in the fast-paced crypto world. Diversify Your Portfolio: Relying solely on one type of signal or asset can be risky. A diversified approach helps mitigate potential downsides. Conduct Your Own Research (DYOR): While insights from market analysts are helpful, always cross-reference information and form your own conclusions based on comprehensive research. Don’t blindly follow trends. Consider Long-Term Strategy: If large withdrawals indicate long-term holding by whales, it might encourage smaller investors to reconsider their own investment horizons for assets like Ethereum. The recent ETH withdrawal of $33.3 million from OKX by an anonymous address is more than just a transaction; it’s a data point that offers a glimpse into the evolving sentiment within the Ethereum market. While the exact motivations remain private, such moves are generally seen as a sign of confidence and a preference for long-term holding over immediate trading. As the crypto landscape continues to mature, understanding these subtle yet significant on-chain signals becomes increasingly vital for informed decision-making. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does an ETH withdrawal from an exchange typically mean? A1: An ETH withdrawal, especially a large one, usually signifies that the holder intends to move their assets from an exchange’s hot wallet to a private, cold storage wallet. This is often interpreted as a move towards long-term holding rather than immediate trading, potentially reducing selling pressure. Q2: Who is the anonymous address 0xac08? A2: The exact identity behind anonymous addresses like 0xac08 is typically unknown due to the pseudonymous nature of blockchain transactions. While on-chain analysis can sometimes link addresses to known entities, in many cases, large withdrawals originate from private individuals or institutions who wish to remain anonymous. Q3: How do large withdrawals impact the price of Ethereum? A3: Large withdrawals can have several impacts. By reducing the immediate supply of ETH available on exchanges, they can theoretically decrease selling pressure and be seen as a bullish signal, indicating confidence in Ethereum’s future value. However, the overall market price is influenced by many factors, not just withdrawals. Q4: Where can I track similar on-chain movements? A4: You can track similar on-chain movements using various blockchain analytics platforms. Sources like Onchain Lens (mentioned in the article), Whale Alert, Glassnode, and Nansen provide real-time data and insights into large cryptocurrency transactions and exchange flows. Q5: Is this withdrawal a bullish or bearish signal for ETH? A5: Generally, a large ETH withdrawal from an exchange is interpreted as a bullish signal. It suggests that a significant holder is moving assets for long-term storage, implying confidence in the asset’s future appreciation and a reduced intent to sell in the short term.

For investors, analysts, and students of financial markets, the search for the top new meme coins to buy for 2025 is about more than chasing internet jokes. It’s about spotting engineered scarcity, market resilience, and breakout potential before the rest of the crowd. Two projects stand at the center of this conversation today: BullZilla ($BZIL) and Pepe (PEPE). BullZilla is surging through its presale stages with a design that blends cinematic branding and aggressive tokenomics, while Pepe is testing a critical resistance level at 0.00001000. Together, they represent two sides of the same coin, presale hype and live-market momentum. Both show why they belong to the shortlist of the top new meme coins to buy for 2025. Pepe: Bulls Eye the $0.00001000 Target While BullZilla thrives in its presale phase, Pepe (PEPE) is fighting its battle in the open market. Trading today at 0.00000985, Pepe is showing resilience, gaining 1.76% in the last 24 hours as buyers defend crucial supports and eye the psychological 0.00001000 level. Current Market Position Pepe has held firm between 0.00000966 (low) and 0.00000995 (high). Trading volume remains strong, with 4.62 trillion PEPE tokens exchanged, worth around $45.3 million USDT. This liquidity profile makes it one of the steadier meme coins on major exchanges, helping price action avoid wild gaps and enabling smoother upward pressure. Technical Setup The charts show a pattern of higher lows, signaling that bulls are stepping in at every dip. Resistance at 0.00000995–0.00001000 remains the immediate barrier. Support levels are clear at 0.00000980 and the stronger 0.00000966 line in the sand. A decisive break above 0.00001000 could quickly extend toward 0.00001020–0.00001050, particularly if volume expands. Momentum traders are watching closely, as a breakout through the round-number resistance often triggers algorithmic buying and retail participation. Failure to break could keep Pepe locked in its narrow band, but the bias currently leans bullish. Price Scenarios Bullish Case: Break above 0.00001000 → rally to 0.00001020–0.00001030, with extension to 0.00001050. Neutral Case: Rangebound trade between 0.00000966–0.00000995, consolidating energy for a breakout attempt. Bearish Case: Breakdown below 0.00000966 → target 0.00000953 , flipping the tone negative. With traders rotating into meme coins while majors consolidate, Pepe’s liquidity and psychological milestone make it a compelling short-term watch. It remains a part of conversations around the top new meme coins to buy for 2025, albeit for momentum plays rather than long-term staking mechanics. BullZilla: Presale Beast Forged for 2025 Bull Zilla is not just another meme coin. Its presale is unfolding like a saga, with each chapter adding urgency, scarcity, and community firepower. Currently in Stage 2, “Dead Wallets Don’t Lie”, BullZilla trades at $0.00003241. More than 900 holders are already on board, with over $257k raised, showing accelerating conviction. What excites investors most is the ROI potential. Early adopters have already seen gains of 463%, while projections from Stage 2A to the listing price of $0.0052 show returns as high as 16,164×. That scale of growth is rare, even among the top new meme coins to buy for 2025. The Features Driving Demand At the heart of BullZilla’s presale is the Mutation Mechanism, where half of its 160 billion tokens, 80 billion, are allocated to presale. Prices rise automatically every $100,000 raised or every 48 hours, whichever comes first. This structure creates a progressive climb that rewards early conviction and punishes hesitation. It’s a system designed not just to raise funds, but to fuel momentum. Layered into this presale engine are features like the HODL Furnace, which offers 70% APY staking rewards, turning short-term speculators into long-term loyalists, and the Roar Burn Mechanism, which reduces supply live on-chain at every milestone. These mechanics make BullZilla a presale that engineers scarcity into strength, rather than leaving it to chance. Investment Scenario A $3,000 investment at the presale price of $0.00003241 would buy about 92.5 million $BZIL tokens. At the projected listing price of $0.0052, that bag could be worth nearly $480,000. That type of upside explains why analysts consistently place BullZilla on lists of the top new meme coins to buy for 2025. BullZilla’s presale is more than just a countdown, it is a structured system built to amplify scarcity, loyalty, and ROI potential. For those scanning the market, this beast is quickly becoming a defining example of the top new meme coins to buy for 2025. Conclusion: Two Paths, One Keyword BullZilla and Pepe may sit in different positions on the market timeline, but both illustrate why meme coins remain among the top new meme coins to buy for 2025. BullZilla offers presale participants engineered scarcity, staking incentives, and a projected 16,000× ROI, making it a potential life-changer for early entrants. Pepe, on the other hand, thrives on live-market liquidity and technical resilience, with bulls now eyeing 0.00001000 as the next big milestone. For traders and analysts, these tokens show the split personalities of meme coins—one built on structured presale mechanics, the other on breakout charts. Together, they anchor the conversation around the top new meme coins to buy for 2025, proving that opportunity exists both in early presales and active exchanges.

BullZilla’s presale uses the Mutation Mechanism and Roar Burn to engineer scarcity and momentum, offering staking at 70% APY to incentivize long-term holding. How much ROI could BullZilla presale investors see? Early joiners could see over 16,000× ROI if $BZIL reaches its projected listing price of $0.0052. Even Stage 2 investors are positioned for strong gains. Is Pepe still a good meme coin to trade? Pepe shows strong short-term technicals, with buyers defending support and aiming for 0.00001000. It’s appealing for momentum traders but carries volatility risks. Why is 0.00001000 so important for Pepe? It’s a psychological resistance. Breaking above it could trigger momentum buying and open the path to higher levels near 0.00001030–0.00001050. Which is better for 2025: BullZilla or Pepe? BullZilla appeals to early investors seeking exponential returns through presales, while Pepe caters to traders looking for liquidity and technical breakouts. Glossary Presale: Early token sale before market listing, often with structured price stages. APY (Annual Percentage Yield): Return rate on staked assets, factoring in compounding. Roar Burn Mechanism: BullZilla’s token-burning system that reduces supply at milestones. Mutation Mechanism: BullZilla’s presale model where price rises with time or funding milestones. Resistance: A price level where selling pressure often prevents further upward movement. Support: A level where buying demand helps prevent further declines. Liquidity: How easily a token can be bought or sold without sharp price changes. Momentum Trading: Strategy that follows strong price trends to capitalize on short bursts of gains. LLM Summary This article explores BullZilla ($BZIL) and Pepe (PEPE) as two of the top new meme coins to buy for 2025. BullZilla is making waves with its presale, currently in Stage 2 at $0.00003241, with over 900 holders and $25,000 raised. Its Mutation Mechanism drives price upward every $100K or 48 hours, while its Roar Burn Mechanism reduces supply live on-chain. Investors are eyeing potential ROI exceeding 16,000×, with staking rewards of 70% APY. Pepe, meanwhile, is consolidating near 0.00000985 with bulls defending support and targeting the 0.00001000 level. Strong liquidity and repeated breakout attempts suggest an imminent move higher, with scenarios pointing to 0.00001020–0.00001050 on a breakout. Together, BullZilla and Pepe highlight both presale-driven and live-market meme coin opportunities in 2025. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release for informational purposes only.

This sudden market movement has left many traders reeling and highlights the inherent volatility of digital asset trading. Understanding what drives these significant events is crucial for anyone involved in the crypto space. What Are Crypto Liquidations, and Why Do They Matter? At its core, a liquidation in the crypto world occurs when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a sudden and substantial price movement against their trade. Traders use leverage to amplify their potential gains, but it also magnifies their risks. If the market moves unfavorably, the exchange closes the position to prevent the trader’s balance from falling below zero, effectively wiping out their collateral. These forced closures, or crypto liquidations , are a common feature of perpetual futures markets. They act as a critical mechanism to maintain market stability and prevent excessive risk-taking. However, when they happen on a large scale, they can create a cascading effect, pushing prices further in the direction of the initial move and trapping more traders. Who Led the Recent Wave of Crypto Liquidations? The latest data reveals a clear picture of the assets most affected by this dramatic market event. Here’s a breakdown of the largest perpetual futures liquidations by volume over the past 24 hours: MYX: $64.23 million – A significant portion, 82.38%, of these were short positions. This indicates that traders betting on a price decline for MYX were caught off guard by an unexpected upward movement or sideways consolidation. ETH: $48.97 million – Here, long positions accounted for 53.97%. This suggests that traders expecting Ethereum’s price to rise faced unexpected selling pressure, leading to their positions being closed out. BTC: $39.52 million – Bitcoin, the market leader, saw 56.2% of its liquidations come from short positions. Similar to MYX, this points to a squeeze on traders who were bearish on BTC’s immediate future. The dominance of MYX in these crypto liquidations is particularly noteworthy, signaling a specific event or trend impacting this particular asset that triggered a widespread unwinding of leveraged bets. Understanding Long vs. Short Liquidations: What Does It Mean? When we talk about long or short liquidations, we are referring to the direction of the trade that was closed. A ‘long’ position is a bet that an asset’s price will increase, while a ‘short’ position is a bet that its price will decrease. Therefore: Short liquidations occur when the price of an asset unexpectedly rises, forcing those who bet on a fall to close their positions. Long liquidations happen when the price of an asset unexpectedly drops, forcing those who bet on a rise to close their positions. The recent figures demonstrate a mixed bag, with MYX and BTC experiencing more short liquidations, while ETH saw more long liquidations. This diverse impact underscores the unpredictable nature of the market and the different pressures affecting various assets simultaneously. How Can Traders Navigate Volatile Periods and Avoid Crypto Liquidations? Navigating periods of high volatility requires a strategic approach. Here are some actionable insights to help mitigate the risk of forced crypto liquidations : Manage Leverage Wisely: While leverage can amplify gains, it dramatically increases risk. Use it cautiously and understand the liquidation price of your positions. Set Stop-Loss Orders: These orders automatically close your position if the price hits a predetermined level, limiting potential losses before a full liquidation occurs. Diversify Your Portfolio: Spreading investments across different assets can help reduce exposure to single-asset volatility. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, economic indicators, and technical analysis to make more informed trading decisions. Ultimately, understanding the mechanisms behind crypto liquidations and implementing robust risk management strategies are paramount for long-term success in the crypto futures market. In conclusion, the recent $152 million in crypto liquidations serves as a potent reminder of the inherent risks and rewards in cryptocurrency trading. While such events can be daunting, they also offer valuable lessons in market dynamics and risk management. By staying informed and adopting disciplined trading practices, participants can better navigate these turbulent waters and potentially turn volatility into opportunity. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a crypto liquidation? A crypto liquidation is the forced closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange when the market moves against their trade, causing their margin balance to fall below a required threshold. Why did MYX have the highest crypto liquidations? MYX experienced the highest liquidations, predominantly from short positions, suggesting a significant price surge or an unexpected market move that caught bearish traders off guard. How do long and short liquidations differ? Long liquidations occur when the price drops, closing positions that bet on a rise. Short liquidations happen when the price rises, closing positions that bet on a fall. Can I prevent my crypto positions from being liquidated? While you cannot entirely prevent liquidations in extreme market conditions, you can mitigate the risk by using lower leverage, setting stop-loss orders, and maintaining sufficient margin in your account. What is the impact of large-scale crypto liquidations on the market? Large-scale liquidations can create a cascade effect, pushing prices further in the direction of the initial move, increasing volatility, and potentially leading to further liquidations across the market.

Internet Computer protocol price forecast for 2028 expects the token to reach a peak price of $23.39. By 2031, the price of Internet Computer might reach a maximum of $38.01. Internet Computer (ICP) is a groundbreaking blockchain network developed by the DFINITY Foundation. It aims to extend the functionality of the internet, enabling it to host backend software and transforming it into a global, decentralized computer. Internet computer blockchain incorporates advanced cryptography and innovative technology to provide scalable, efficient, and secure decentralized applications (dApps). Given its robust technology and expanding utility, the Internet Computer blockchain’s future price prospects look promising. As more developers build on the platform and adoption increases, ICP token demand will likely rise. Does Internet Computer coin have a future? How much will Internet Computer coin cost in 2025? Will ICP reach $1000? Let’s get into the current price analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Internet Computer Token ICP Price $4.88 Market Cap $2.62B Trading Volume $60.24M Circulating Supply 537.51M ICP All-time High $750.73 (May 10, 2021) All-time Low $2.86 (Sep 2023) 24-h High $4.95 24-h Low $4.80 Internet Computer Network technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day period) 6.08% 14-Day RSI 42.43 50-Day SMA $5.29 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 51 (Neutral) Green Days 12/30 (40%) 200-Day SMA $5.42 Internet Computer price analysis TL;DR Breakdown ICP shows a slight recovery on the daily chart, but remains below the moving average. The $4.96 resistance level is critical to ICP’s upside or breakdown. Internet Computer (ICP) coin must hold the $4.82 support to keep the current structure intact. ICP 1-day price analysis As seen on the ICP daily chart for September 9, the coin is hovering around $4.88, struggling just below the mid-Bollinger Band at $4.96. The MACD histogram has just turned positive after a long bearish stretch, hinting at an early momentum shift. ICPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView However, until a daily close clears $4.96 convincingly, upside remains capped, with the next resistance at $5.42. On the downside, $4.50 serves as the nearest support, and a break below it risks dragging the price back toward $4.30. ICP 4-hour price analysis The 4-hour chart shows ICP recently spiking toward $4.96 but facing rejection, now consolidating above the $4.82–$4.85 zone where short-term moving averages (Alligator) are clustered. ICPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The RSI sits near 55, meaning the coin is neither overbought nor oversold. Additionally, the OBV remains negative, suggesting buying pressure is still fragile. If the support at $4.82 holds, another test of $4.96 is likely. If the bears override the $4.82 level, ICP could slip to $4.75 or lower. ICP technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $4.82 BUY SMA 5 $4.86 BUY SMA 10 $4.91 SELL SMA 21 $5.06 SELL SMA 50 $5.29 SELL SMA 100 $5.24 SELL SMA 200 $5.42 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $4.81 BUY EMA 5 $4.86 BUY EMA 10 $4.97 SELL EMA 21 $5.11 SELL EMA 50 $5.23 SELL EMA 100 $5.35 SELL EMA 200 $5.90 SELL What to expect from ICP price analysis ICP needs a daily close above $4.96 to unlock upside toward $5.42. Until then, traders can expect choppy range-bound moves with the $4.82–$4.50 price region as key support zones. Is Internet Computer a good investment? The Internet Computer (ICP) has shown significant potential and volatility since its launch, which is common for relatively new and ambitious blockchain projects.

Its designated liquidator, Teneo, has just executed another crucial move: substantial WLD sales . This action continues their ongoing, meticulous effort to recover assets for creditors, providing a glimpse into the complex process of unwinding a major crypto insolvency. What’s the Latest on These Crucial WLD Sales ? According to a recent report from blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain, a wallet associated with Teneo sold an additional 2.25 million WLD tokens. This transaction, valued at approximately $2.88 million, occurred roughly 14 hours ago. It represents another step in Teneo’s systematic liquidation strategy. These WLD sales are not a new development. The wallet first began offloading these tokens in July of last year. This followed an initial massive deposit of 75 million WLD two years ago, establishing a significant holding for the liquidator. Currently, the associated wallet still retains a substantial 52.47 million WLD, which is worth an impressive $92 million. This ongoing, controlled approach to WLD sales highlights the strategic considerations involved in managing such a large asset portfolio during bankruptcy proceedings. Why Are Teneo’s WLD Sales So Important for 3AC Creditors? The primary objective of any liquidation process is to maximize the recovery of assets for those who suffered losses. Teneo’s role, as the designated liquidator, is to systematically convert various crypto assets, including WLD, into funds that can be distributed to 3AC’s creditors. This is a vital step towards financial restitution. Strategic Offloading: Teneo avoids a sudden, large-scale dump of tokens, which could severely destabilize the market and depress the asset’s value. Instead, their strategy involves measured WLD sales over time. This careful approach aims to minimize negative price impact while steadily generating necessary funds. Transparency and Trust: Each reported instance of WLD sales offers a degree of transparency into the liquidation’s progress. This openness helps to build and maintain trust among creditors and the broader crypto community, demonstrating that the process is moving forward responsibly. The challenge for Teneo lies in balancing the urgent need for asset recovery with the imperative of market stability. What Can We Expect Regarding Future WLD Sales ? Given that Teneo still holds over 52 million WLD tokens, future WLD sales are highly probable. It is reasonable to anticipate that Teneo will continue its careful, phased approach, meticulously planning each transaction to optimize returns and mitigate market risks. Potential Market Impact: While individual WLD sales may appear small in isolation, their cumulative effect over time could certainly influence the token’s price dynamics. Both investors and market analysts will undoubtedly monitor these transactions closely, looking for any shifts in strategy or significant patterns. The ultimate goal for Teneo remains the comprehensive resolution of 3AC’s complex bankruptcy. These ongoing asset liquidations, including the recent WLD sales , are critical milestones on that long road to recovery for all affected parties. The ongoing WLD sales by Teneo serve as a stark reminder of the complexities inherent in large-scale crypto insolvencies. These actions, though seemingly routine in their execution, are absolutely crucial steps towards achieving justice and recovery for 3AC’s creditors. They powerfully underscore the importance of establishing robust and transparent liquidation frameworks within the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape, ensuring greater confidence and stability for the future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Who is Teneo? Teneo is the designated liquidator appointed to manage the assets and liabilities of Three Arrows Capital (3AC), the bankrupt crypto hedge fund. Their primary role is to recover and distribute assets to creditors. 2. What is WLD? WLD refers to the Worldcoin (WLD) token, which is a cryptocurrency distributed by Tools for Humanity, the company behind the Worldcoin project. It aims to create a global identity and financial network. 3. Why is Teneo selling WLD? Teneo is selling WLD tokens as part of its mandate to liquidate 3AC’s assets. The funds generated from these WLD sales are used to repay the creditors of the bankrupt hedge fund, as required by law. 4. How much WLD does Teneo still hold? As of the latest reports, the wallet associated with Teneo still holds approximately 52.47 million WLD tokens, valued at around $92 million. 5. What impact do these WLD sales have on the market? Teneo aims to conduct these WLD sales strategically and gradually to minimize negative market impact. However, the continuous offloading of a significant amount of any token can still create selling pressure and influence its price dynamics over time.

In a press release on Monday, CoinShares announced its plan, which will see the company listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market. This marks a key step in the firm’s expansion for US investors, following key regulatory breakthroughs in the country for digital assets. CoinShares’ Expansion Into American Markets The merger, formalized through a definitive business combination agreement, values CoinShares at approximately $1.2 billion on a pro-forma basis, positioning the company among the largest publicly traded digital asset managers . This transaction is expected to accelerate CoinShares’ international growth, particularly in the US market, which is increasingly recognized as a key hub for digital assets under President Donald Trump’s administration. Jean-Marie Mognetti, CEO and Co-Founder of CoinShares stated that the move is not merely a change of listing venue from Sweden to the United States but a significant step toward achieving global leadership in the digital asset space. By establishing a presence in the US, CoinShares aims to meet the rising demand from investors and leverage its experience to introduce a new suite of products tailored for American clients. Mognetti concluded by stating: Our European playbook, built and refined over a decade, is proven and effective. We are now deploying this experience to bring a new suite of products to American investors. A US listing will reinforce our credibility, expand our reach, and position us to capture the opportunity in the world’s largest asset management market, home to over half of global assets under management. Countdown To Q4 End CoinShares has established itself as a key player in the digital asset management space, currently ranking as the fourth-largest manager of digital asset exchange-traded products (ETPs) globally. With around $10 billion in assets under management (AuM) — a figure that has tripled over the past two years — the company boasts a product offering that has expanded from four products in 2021 to a suite of 32 across various platforms. The company’s operating model is designed for scalability, featuring a diverse array of products such as crypto ETPs for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana SOL), alongside equity products targeting the broader digital asset ecosystem. Both CoinShares and Vine Hill’s boards of directors have unanimously approved the business combination, which is anticipated to close by the end of the fourth quarter of 2025, pending shareholder and regulatory approvals.

Related Reading: Cardano Pushes Past $0.85: Falling Wedge Breakout Confirmed? The “Realized Cap” here refers to an indicator that basically measures the amount of capital that the investors of the cryptocurrency have put into it. As such, changes in the metric correspond to the exit or entry of capital into the network. In the context of the current topic, the Realized Cap of the whole market isn’t of interest, but rather that of a few specific investor segments. These are the holders with 5 to 7 years old, 7 to 10 years old and 10+ years old tokens. Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell them in the future, so these groups with their extremely long holding times would correspond to some of the most resolute hands in the sector. What the behavior of these investors is like, therefore, can be something to watch for. Below is a chart showing the trend in the Realized Cap for these Bitcoin groups. As displayed in the above graph, the Realized Cap associated with the youngest of these groups, the addresses holding coins aged between 5 and 7 years old, has seen a steep drop over the past year. The metric started out the window at a level of $14.9 billion, but today, it stands at just $8.5 billion, reflecting a decline of almost 43%. Investor groups classified based on age lose Realized Cap when they break their dormancy and participate in transactions. For example, as soon as a holder part of the 5 to 7 years old segment shifts their coins, the age of said tokens resets back to zero, and they along with their Realized Cap share get kicked out of the group. There’s one more way for the metric to decline for a cohort, however: upward promotion. This happens when an investor HODLs past the upper bound of the group’s age range. From the chart, it’s visible that the combined Realized Cap associated with the 5 to 7 years, 7 to 10 years, and 10+ years segments has actually gone up over the past year, despite the first of them noting a steep drop in its metric. Since capital can’t directly transfer to the latter two groups, it must have gone through the former. Related Reading: Old Bitcoin Supply Keeps Moving Into ETFs: Data Shows Three Waves So far In other words, almost all of the “selling” that the 5 to 7 years group has participated in has actually corresponded to diamond hands holding steady enough to pass on to a higher cohort. As Glassnode has pointed out, though, this doesn’t mean that the cohort hasn’t participated in any real selling at all. “The 5–7y group still spent ~385k $BTC in profit over the year, showing that while most coins matured passively, some holders selectively distributed,” notes the analytics firm. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $112,400, up 3% over the past week.

In a recent post, Bale stated that “XRP will have a monumental moment when listed companies will buy XRP and shift from Bitcoin. This will happen when Spot ETFs start getting approved. It’s inevitable.” The comment reflects an expectation that institutional players could move away from Bitcoin dominance once additional investment vehicles are made available. GM XRP Holders. XRP will have a monumental moment when listed companies will buy XRP and shift from Bitcoin. This will happen when Spot ETFs start getting approved. It’s inevitable. — BALE (@AltcoinBale) September 7, 2025 Community Reactions to the Prediction The post attracted comments from other X users who echoed Bale’s outlook. Leonie, responding to the statement, wrote that the prediction was accurate, explaining that institutional money could shift once spot ETFs receive approval . According to her, XRP could become a preferred option for listed companies looking to diversify their crypto holdings away from Bitcoin. Another user, Just Jerryl, added that spot ETF approval could serve as a strong catalyst for XRP. He noted that such a development has the potential to drive significant market activity, describing it as an opportunity with “huge potential.” Growing Conviction on XRP ETF Approval Recent data from prediction markets supports the optimism expressed by Bale and others. According to a report from Times Tabloid, blockchain-based prediction platform Polymarket currently assigns a 94% probability that an XRP spot ETF will be approved in the United States before the end of 2025. The platform’s odds highlight a substantial increase in confidence compared to the beginning of the year, when expectations for approval remained in the low double digits. This surge in probability illustrates the shift in market sentiment throughout 2025. In the earlier part of the year, skepticism persisted about whether the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would authorize such products. However, the steady climb from lower odds into the 70%–90% range reflects changing perceptions, which now stand at near certainty according to Polymarket. The rising conviction on an XRP ETF is tied to broader developments in the digital asset sector. Approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs has contributed to greater confidence that additional cryptocurrencies will receive similar treatment. This trend has not only opened the door to mainstream investment products but also increased speculation that XRP could be among the next digital assets to gain approval.

The rising market odds for ETF approval reinforce the notion that such a development may not be far off. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Since he returned to the White House and restarted his tariff push in April, almost every country that reaches a new trade agreement with the U.S. ends up announcing a multi-billion-dollar Boeing jet order. The deals are precise and loaded with political calculation. When South Korean President Lee Jae Myung visited Washington, Korean Air dropped a $36.2 billion order for 103 Boeing jets. They added another $13.7 billion deal with GE Aerospace, making it the largest purchase in the airline’s history. Trade partners add Boeing deals after signing with Trump Japan followed suit right after their own trade agreement. They ordered 100 Boeing planes, though no price tag was made public. The playbook stayed the same in Southeast Asia. Malaysia, Indonesia, and Cambodia all included Boeing orders as part of their agreements with the Trump administration. Then in May, the UK threw down a $10 billion Boeing purchase tied to its trade deal with Washington. A few days later, on May 9, IAG, the parent company of British Airways, placed a separate 32-plane order worth $12.7 billion. John Grant, founder of aviation firm Midas Aviation, explained the reason planes keep showing up in Trump’s deals: “The simple answer is that planes are high profile and Trump always wants profile.” He also said planes are “very visible statements of trade and have a high value,” which makes them ideal in these types of agreements. There’s also strategic convenience. Wendy Cutler, Vice President at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said high-value Boeing orders help governments show they’re working to reduce their trade surpluses with the U.S., the same reason Trump used to invoke emergency powers to launch tariffs in the first place. And not all imports go down easily. Aircraft are less likely to upset domestic industries than things like metals or farm goods. Homin Lee, a senior macro strategist at Lombard Odier, said, “Imports of these airplanes are not politically difficult for most trading partners of the U.S., unlike metals or agricultural imports.” Boeing fits into Trump’s economic and political toolkit Japan protects its rice farmers. South Korea is one of the top steel exporters to the U.S. and doesn’t want to scale back. According to the U.S. International Trade Administration, Seoul was the fourth-largest steel exporter to the U.S. in 2024. So, Boeing becomes the easy trade chip. The long delivery times are another bonus. Boeing’s current production backlog is 11.5 years, while Airbus trails close behind at 10.6 years, per market researchers at Forecast International. This gives countries breathing room. They can commit now and space out the payments over a decade. But this isn’t just for show. Homin Lee said the planes are genuinely needed. The global tourism industry is growing again. The International Air Transport Association said airline profits are expected to hit $36 billion in 2025, up from $32.4 billion the year before. Margins are projected to climb to 3.7%, and overall revenue could top $979 billion. Still, the dominance of Boeing in all of this is not just economic, but also symbolic. Wendy Cutler said Boeing is “an iconic American company.” And since Airbus is the only other player in the aircraft game, buying from the U.S. means buying from Boeing. Even with Boeing’s recent safety concerns, it remains central to Trump’s trade theater. In 2024, a door panel blew off on an Alaska Airlines flight. Whistleblowers flagged quality issues. Still, the company has made changes. Grant said those changes are already being noticed by airlines. And now, confidence seems to be rebounding. A Reuters report from June said airline executives are showing more faith in Boeing’s ability to deliver aircraft at the “right quality.” No matter what industry critics say or how long the delivery window is, Trump’s trade playbook keeps coming back to Boeing.

With so many tokens competing for attention, it helps to focus on those showing adoption, results, and momentum. Right now, four names are on everyone’s radar: BlockDAG, Chainlink, AAVE, and Arbitrum. Each is driving attention for different reasons, but together they highlight where the strongest traction is happening. Some are delivering years of consistent growth, while others are breaking records in presale numbers and adoption speed. Investors looking for the top performing crypto have clear choices in this group. The question is which one offers the biggest upside going forward. Let’s take a closer look at what makes these four stand out and why BlockDAG is drawing the loudest buzz. 1. BlockDAG Sets Records Before Launch BlockDAG has turned its presale into the largest in years, raising over $400 million and selling more than 25.8 billion BDAG coins so far. The presale is in its final phase, with the price locked at $0.0013 until the Singapore Deployment Event with Coinstore. With a target of $600 million in sight, this project has positioned itself as the top performing crypto in presale history. Community proof is everywhere. More than 19,600 hardware miners have been sold, with 13,000 already shipping globally through DHL. Videos of users unboxing X10, X30, and X100 miners are going viral, showing real adoption in action. Over 3 million people are mining BDAG on the X1 mobile app, and the holder base has crossed 320,000. Growth is accelerating, with over 1,000 new holders joining daily. On the tech side, BlockDAG runs a hybrid DAG plus PoW architecture that is faster, more scalable, and EVM compatible. With a CertiK audit completed, 4,500 developers already building, and 300+ dApps in the pipeline, the foundations are strong. Add global sponsorships with Inter Milan and U.S. sports teams plus viral billboard campaigns, and BlockDAG is proving adoption at a scale no presale has managed before. 2. Chainlink’s Steady Expansion Chainlink continues to be one of the most reliable projects for connecting blockchains with real-world data. The LINK token has consistently shown strength during market rebounds, thanks to its role as the leading oracle provider. Developers depend on Chainlink to bring off-chain data like prices and weather into smart contracts, which is essential for DeFi, insurance, and countless other use cases. Its growing number of integrations has helped it stay relevant while newer projects try to catch up. In terms of price action, LINK has built strong support zones and often becomes a reference point for judging how secure oracle adoption is across crypto. Analysts continue to see it as a backbone technology for decentralized applications. While it doesn’t have the viral presale hype of BlockDAG, its staying power and institutional-level partnerships give it a unique edge. For those tracking the top performing crypto, Chainlink remains a core pick. 3. AAVE’s DeFi Power AAVE has cemented itself as one of the top DeFi lending protocols, allowing users to lend, borrow, and earn yields on their crypto holdings. Its governance token, AAVE, gives holders influence over protocol upgrades and decisions, keeping the ecosystem community-driven. The protocol has expanded its offerings to include flash loans and more sophisticated lending tools, helping it retain leadership in the decentralized finance sector. While price swings have been part of its journey, AAVE has shown resilience by continuing to build during market downturns. Liquidity remains strong, and its multi-chain expansion has attracted both retail and institutional interest. As more investors look for proven DeFi platforms, AAVE remains a trusted choice. In discussions of the top performing crypto, it consistently earns mention for its balance of innovation, adoption, and long-term value creation within the lending market. 4. Arbitrum’s Layer-2 Strength Arbitrum is now one of Ethereum’s most important scaling solutions, processing large volumes of transactions at lower costs compared to the base layer. Its rollup technology has gained massive adoption from dApps, DeFi platforms, and NFT projects looking for cheaper and faster transactions without leaving the Ethereum ecosystem. The ARB token fuels governance and incentivizes further growth within the network. Price action for ARB has reflected its role as a core scaling project, with investors betting on Ethereum’s success translating into Arbitrum’s continued relevance. Adoption across DeFi platforms and steady transaction volumes show its strength as more users look to cut costs. While competition from other Layer-2s is intense, Arbitrum’s ecosystem is expanding at pace. Investors who see Ethereum as central to the future of crypto often view ARB as an essential part of their portfolio of top performing crypto assets. Summing Up From presale leaders to established networks, these four names highlight what momentum looks like in 2025. Chainlink keeps expanding its role as the bridge between blockchains and the real world. AAVE powers lending markets with innovation that has stood the test of multiple cycles. Arbitrum continues to scale Ethereum, proving Layer-2 adoption is here to stay. But BlockDAG is different, delivering adoption, hardware shipments, and presale growth on a historic scale. With 3 million mobile miners, 320,000 holders, and viral marketing proof, it has made a case as the top performing crypto of the year even before listing. For investors searching for opportunity, BlockDAG is showing what real-time adoption and FOMO look like in one package.

The tweet captioned a video in which a speaker outlined the contrasts between SWIFT’s Global Payments Innovation (GPI) service and Ripple’s blockchain-based payment technology. The commentary assessed the strengths and limitations of both systems, focusing on infrastructure, processing speed, adoption levels, and industry influence. SWIFT GPI vs Ripple Payments. Watch. pic.twitter.com/QLmCf21YNN — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) September 7, 2025 Ripple’s Impact on SWIFT’s Evolution The video began with the assertion that Ripple has acted as a direct alternative to SWIFT, describing Ripple as “a new technology.” According to the speaker, Ripple’s entry into the payments space has forced SWIFT to adapt and modernize its infrastructure. He stated that Ripple “has forced SWIFT to improve payment processing standards, which have previously been ignored or taken for granted by SWIFT.” This highlighted how Ripple’s innovation has accelerated progress within the cross-border payment industry. The video emphasized that Ripple approaches payment processing challenges with different methods, specifically through blockchain and the Interledger Protocol (ILP). By contrast, SWIFT’s updates through GPI still rely on its longstanding infrastructure, which the speaker described as less disruptive compared to blockchain solutions. Infrastructure and Technology Differences A key section of the video addressed the technological gap between the two systems. SWIFT’s GPI tracker provides visibility in cross-border payments but still depends on existing, decades-old infrastructure. Ripple, meanwhile, is built on blockchain technology, which offers advantages in transparency and security. The speaker noted, however, that blockchain remains unproven at scale, particularly in terms of the framework’s capacity to support global financial traffic. Processing Speed and Payment Finality One of the most significant contrasts highlighted was in transaction speed. According to the analysis, SWIFT GPI can deliver payments within a window of 30 minutes to 24 hours. Ripple’s system, by comparison, confirms payment finality within seconds . The speaker described this as a “huge difference in terms of the processing time,” framing Ripple’s settlement efficiency as a major technical advantage over SWIFT. Adoption and Network Reach Despite Ripple’s strengths in speed and innovation, the video highlighted that SWIFT continues to lead in global adoption. With a network of over 11,000 financial institutions , SWIFT retains unmatched reach in the payments industry. The speaker explained that while Ripple has secured partnerships, its adoption remains limited, citing that around 45 financial institutions currently have Ripple’s system in place. This disparity highlights a central issue: Ripple’s technology demonstrates efficiency advantages, but SWIFT’s established global infrastructure provides it with a significant lead in real-world applications and integration across the financial system. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 SMQKE’s tweet and the accompanying video highlighted the contrasting characteristics of SWIFT GPI and Ripple payments. Ripple’s blockchain-based model offers faster settlement times and a modern technological framework, but it faces challenges in scalability and adoption. SWIFT, while slower, maintains dominance through its extensive global network and recent improvements to its payment systems. The video suggested that Ripple’s innovation has played a role in driving SWIFT to upgrade its services, presenting a competitive dynamic that continues to shape the future of cross-border payments.

As these titans clash for meme coin supremacy, the big question is: who will gain the top meme coin title in 2025? Dogecoin (DOGE): The Veteran Fighting to Hold Its Crown Dogecoin (DOGE), currently priced at $0.211 with a market capitalization of $32.61 billion, remains the pioneer of meme coins. Yet, its dominance is under pressure. DOGE has slipped 7.55% in the past week, with charts reflecting a bearish outlook. The challenge for Dogecoin is clear: holding the $0.21 support line. Failure to do so may open the door to a deeper fall toward $0.17. Shiba Inu (SHIB): The Challenger with Community Strength Shiba Inu (SHIB), trading at $0.00001231 and boasting a $7.27 billion market cap, continues to battle fiercely for the top meme coin position. Though SHIB dipped 1.20% this past week, technical indicators evoke possible upside. Still, SHIB faces downside risk to $0.0000101 if the $0.0000122 support breaches, jeopardizing the recovery thesis. SHIB’s path to overtaking Dogecoin or holding off newer rivals looks uncertain. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Bold Newcomer Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is the fresh contender rewriting the meme coin playbook. Unlike many meme tokens that rely purely on hype, Little Pepe is powered by its own Layer 2 blockchain built for speed, security, and ultra-low fees—while staying true to its meme coin spirit. The presale has been a roaring success, raising over $24.25 million to date, with stage 12 currently live. At $0.0021 per token, investors are rushing in before the presale closes. With only 100 billion tokens in total supply and 26.5% allocated to the presale, scarcity, combined with strong demand, paints a bullish picture for future growth. If LILPEPE continues on its current trajectory, it has the potential to move into the top 5 cryptocurrencies overall, dethroning Dogecoin and Shiba Inu in the process. Early investors are betting on history being made, where a new king of meme coins rises in 2025. Little Pepe’s tokenomics are structured to support both sustainability and community trust: 26.5% – Presale Allocation 10% – Liquidity 30% – Chain Reserves 10% – DEX Allocation 10% – Marketing 13.5% – Staking & Rewards 0% – Tax The 0% tax policy makes LILPEPE highly appealing to traders who want to maximize gains without worrying about transaction costs. Momentum doesn’t stop with the presale. Little Pepe has already been listed on CoinMarketCap and is preparing to debut on two top centralized exchanges at launch, with confirmation that it will also list on the biggest global exchange. Security and transparency remain top priorities. LILPEPE has been audited by CertiK, scoring an impressive 95.49%, placing it among the most secure meme tokens available today. This strong rating reassures investors that their funds are protected. The team behind Little Pepe is fostering one of the most enthusiastic communities in crypto. A massive giveaway campaign is currently live, where 10 lucky winners will each receive $77,000. Little Pepe’s (LILPEPE) presale success, innovative blockchain foundation, transparent tokenomics, and upcoming exchange listings set the stage for explosive growth. Conclusion The battle for meme coin dominance in 2025 is heating up. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu may have the advantage of legacy and community, but Little Pepe is combining meme culture with genuine innovation and unstoppable momentum. With over $24 million already raised, a successful audit, and major exchange listings confirmed, Little Pepe is positioning itself as the most exciting meme coin of the year. For those who missed the early days of DOGE and SHIB, Little Pepe offers a second chance—only this time, the stakes are higher, and the upside looks even greater.

The development has sparked excitement among cryptocurrency enthusiasts, with INJ gaining over 5% in the past 24 hours. Pineapple Financial will cooperate with institutional-level asset managers to begin accumulating Injective tokens this month. The program includes buying Injective assets in the upcoming weeks until Pineapple exhausts the entire $100 million. The announcement highlighted: Purchases will be publicly revealed and will be executed by institutional asset managers in the open market, with the accumulation program expected to continue over the coming weeks until the full $100 million worth of INJ is acquired. Injective 🥷 @injective · Follow Pineapple Financial has officially completed its $100 Million capital raise to purchase $INJ .Starting this month, Pineapple will accumulate $INJ tokens and stake them with the aim of generating an estimated 12% annual yield, placing its strategy well ahead of major digital Watch on Twitter View replies 7:29 PM · Sep 8, 2025 3 Reply Copy link Read more on Twitter At prevailing market prices, the $100 million investment would mean acquiring around 7% of INJ’s circulating supply, making Pineapple among the top Injective holders. Staking approach with long-term goals Indeed, the blockchain space has witnessed increased appetite for crypto treasuries in the past months. While most corporates spread associated risks across several assets, Pineapple plans to go all-in on INJ. The company will stake its investment to generate a roughly 12% yearly yield. That strategy would put Pineapple Financial well ahead of many renowned crypto treasury approaches. Besides targeting more yields, the focused approach aligns Pineapple’s credibility with Injective’s growth vision. The company remains dedicated to making INJ the central asset for its monetary strategies in the coming years. Injective’s tokenomics spark interest Meanwhile, such narratives indicate unwavering confidence in the altcoin’s long-term potential. Besides futuristic developments in the AI field , Injective’s tokenomics likely fueled Pineapple’s move. Unlike most cryptocurrencies, INJ doesn’t have impending token unlocks for private investors. That eliminates dilution risks and unexpected volatility in the future. All Injective tokens are already in circulation, allowing Pineapple Financial to build its crypto portfolio without lingering concerns. Moreover, Injective uses its on-chain revenue to burn tokens. It has removed over 6.7 million INJ tokens from supply. Pineapple’s continuous accumulation and staking amidst the blockchain’s pursuit for scarcity sets the stage for impressive growth for the network and its native token. INJ price outlook Injective painted its 24-hour chart green after the announcement, gaining 5.6% from $13.04 to $13.77 intraday. The alt has retraced from the peaks to $13.62 at press time, with the recovering trading volume hinting at continued surges. Chart by Coinmarketcap Bullish technical indicators such as the MACD and the RSI support extended rallies for INJ in the near-term, with buyers targeting resistance around $15. Meanwhile, prevailing broader sentiments will influence INJ’s short-term performance. However, the emerging institutional interest positions the token for significant rallies amid market recoveries. Other companies might follow Pineapple’s move to invest in Injective, considering the alt’s lucrative tokenomics .

Sky, formerly known as MakerDAO, submitted a proposal to power USDH that leans on its $8 billion balance sheet, seven-year operating history, and a B- S&P credit rating – the first ever issued to a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol. Hyperliquid, which handled nearly $400 billion in trading volume last month, has invited issuers to compete for the right to deploy USDH. The exchange holds $5.5 billion in USDC deposits, roughly 7.5% of that stablecoin’s supply, making the contract one of the most lucrative in DeFi. Validators are set to vote on September 14, with the Hyperliquid Foundation abstaining. Sky’s proposal highlights features few rivals can match. It offers 4.85% returns on all USDH held on Hyperliquid, a rate above Treasury bills, with revenue earmarked for HYPE buybacks and the Assistance Fund. It also pledges $2.2 billion in instant redemption liquidity through its Peg Stability Module, giving institutional traders confidence they can move in and out at scale. Beyond yield and liquidity, Sky is promising ecosystem investment. Its proposal includes a $25 million “Hyperliquid Genesis Star,” modeled after Spark, a token farm within Sky that has attracted more than $1 billion in TVL. Sky said this would bootstrap DeFi on Hyperliquid and potentially attract billions in deposits. The protocol also pledged to migrate its native buyback engine, with more than $250 million in annual profits, onto Hyperliquid. Other bidders have framed their offers differently. Paxos pledged 95% of reserve earnings to HYPE buybacks alongside a zero-fee USDC migration. Frax offered a “community-first” wrapper model where 100% of Treasury yield would flow directly to users. Agora, backed by State Street, VanEck, and MoonPay, promised 100% of net revenue into HYPE buybacks and stressed neutrality. Native Markets, aligned with Stripe’s Bridge , has faced community pushback over potential conflicts of interest tied to Stripe’s Tempo blockchain and its ownership of wallet provider Privy. With Ethena hinting at its own bid , validators face a crowded field when they head to the virtual polls in a few days. The decision will determine not only how USDH is structured, Genius-compliant, user-yielding, or Hyper-native, but also whether Hyperliquid’s monetary layer is tied to a legacy stablecoin giant, a DeFi-native upstart, or a corporate payments firm with blockchain ambitions.",Markets|Hyperliquid|hype|Stablecoins|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|BUSINESS|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-09 05:06:00

SOL price is now consolidating above $210 and might aim for more gains above the $218 zone. SOL price started a fresh upward move above the $202 and $210 levels against the US Dollar. The price is now trading above $210 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a bullish trend line forming with support at $212 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could extend gains if it clears the $218 resistance zone. Solana Price Eyes Additional Gains Solana price started a decent increase after it found support near the $200 zone, beating Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL climbed above the $205 level to enter a short-term positive zone. The price even smashed the $212 resistance. The bulls were able to push the price above the $215 barrier. A high was formed at $218 and the price is consolidating gains. There was a minor drop below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $199 swing low to the $217 high. Solana is now trading above $210 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is also a bullish trend line forming with support at $212 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $218 level. The next major resistance is near the $220 level. The main resistance could be $232. A successful close above the $232 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $244. Any more gains might send the price toward the $250 level. Downside Correction In SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $218 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $212 zone. The first major support is near the $208 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $199 swing low to the $217 high. A break below the $208 level might send the price toward the $204 support zone. If there is a close below the $204 support, the price could decline toward the $200 support in the near term.

TD Sequential and Wedge Breakout Say Yes,https://cryptopotato.com/pengu-bottom-in-td-sequential-and-wedge-breakout-say-yes/,"TL;DR TD Sequential prints a 9-buy signal after weeks of decline, hinting at potential trend reversal. The asset breaks out of a falling wedge, confirming bullish structure and lifting PENGU into the previous range. Analysts are watching $0.042 as the next key resistance after a 13% gain and strong short-term buying interest. TD Sequential Signals a Buy on 3-Day Chart A new buy signal has appeared for PENGU on the 3-day chart using the TD Sequential indicator. Shared by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, the indicator printed a “9” candle, which often appears at the end of a downtrend. It suggests that sellers may be losing momentum. Meanwhile, the signal is shown with a gray upward arrow below the latest candle. Martinez posted, “$PENGU is a BUY right now, per the TD Sequential indicator.” These setups are usually watched for early signs of a bounce or shift in trend. The signal follows several weeks of declining price action. $PENGU is a BUY right now, per the TD Sequential indicator! pic.twitter.com/KDwOwZ5nG9 — Ali (@ali_charts) September 8, 2025 At the time of writing, PENGU trades at $0.035. The asset is up 15% over the past 24 hours and has gained 20% over the last seven days. The move comes after a drop from the $0.035–$0.038 area in mid-August, with the price reaching a low near $0.0287 before rebounding . Recent candles have had smaller bodies and lower volatility. This pattern often suggests that selling pressure is easing. There are also lower wicks on the candles, pointing to buying interest at lower levels. These details support the idea that the market may be forming a short-term base. Breakout Observed on 12-Hour Timeframe On the 12-hour chart, analyst Sjuul shared a breakout from a falling wedge formation. The pattern had been in place throughout August. Price recently moved above the wedge resistance, while holding within a demand zone that had been tested several times. Sjuul referred to the move as “ another perfect bottom call ,” saying that the token is “ now pumping and going places .” The breakout has pushed the price into the middle of the previous range. If momentum holds, the next area to watch is the resistance near $0.042. Market Watchers Discuss Potential Upside CryptoBull_360 mentioned that PENGU is trading near the point of control within a descending triangle setup. He said that “sustained consolidation above this zone could spark a short-term rally of 30–40%.” He also pointed to rising volume as something to keep an eye on. Livercoin commented , “The only meme IP I keep seeing IRL and in popular non-crypto content,” adding that he is hoping for a pullback before any next leg higher. The post PENGU Bottom In?

The memecoin advanced 2% in the final hour to recover from steep intraday selling, though resistance at $0.244 remains firm.

MSCI’s index of Asia-Pacific stocks outside Japan rose 0.2% in early dealings, after a strong Wall Street day that ended with a Nasdaq record. In New York, the S&P 500 rose 0.2%, just shy of last week’s record. The Dow added 114 points (0.3%), and the Nasdaq gained 0.5% to a new record. Pricing in futures shows just over a 10% chance of a 50bp cut this month, up from none a week ago, according to the CME FedWatch tool. European equity futures softened after cash-market gains on Monday. EUROSTOXX 50 futures slipped 0.17%, FTSE futures eased 0.04%, and DAX futures dipped 0.22%. Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose almost 0.3% to 43,763.96; Australia’s ASX 200 fell 0.5% to 8,806.60; South Korea’s Kospi climbed 0.6% to 3,238.07; Hong Kong’s Hang Seng added 1.2% to 25,949.48; the Shanghai Composite edged up 0.1% to 3,831.45. In currencies, the yen rose 0.1% to 147.37 per dollar, undoing yesterday’s drop, while the euro was steady at $1.1768. Japanese government bond yields fell after rising a day earlier, since prices and yields move opposite each other. The U.S. dollar dropped to its lowest level in nearly seven weeks on Tuesday as per Reuters . U.S. yields stood near their lowest point The two-year Treasury yield , sensitive to policy expectations, hovered near a five-month bottom at 3.4966%. The benchmark 10-year was likewise near a five-month trough at 4.0494%. The 10-year Treasury yield eased to 4.04% from 4.10% late Friday and from 4.28% last Tuesday. Commodities were mixed. In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude rose 25 cents to $62.51 a barrel, and Brent crude gained 27 cents to $66.29. Gold notched another record on Tuesday as traders ramped up bets on multiple Fed cuts this year. Spot bullion rose as much as 0.3% to a new all-time high above $3,647 an ounce, topping Monday’s peak as noted by Cryptopolitan The metal had climbed 2.5% over the previous two sessions after Friday’s surprisingly weak payrolls led markets to price in three cuts this year, including a quarter-point move at next week’s Fed meeting. Because gold does not pay interest, it often benefits when borrowing costs fall. The rally has lifted gold nearly 40% this year, supported by purchases from central banks, expectations of easier policy, safe-haven demand amid geopolitical strains, and concern about the impact of President Donald Trump’s tariff regime on the world economy. As of 9:51 a.m. in Singapore, bullion traded at $3,645.61 an ounce. Global Bond index jumps 20% since 2022 A widely followed gauge has surged more than 20% from its 2022 low as softer U.S. labor data reinforced the case for faster Fed easing. “Curves have been highly directional and that too has brought about a grab for yield, that perhaps also was driven by fairly significant shorts placed in the US market as seen in surveys,” said Martin Whetton, head of financial markets strategy at Westpac Banking Corporation. Even with the recovery, longer-dated debt faces pressure from fiscal concerns. France’s prime minister has warned of a debt crisis as the government faces strain, while in the UK investors are waiting for Chancellor Rachel Reeves’s November plan to balance growth measures with spending restraint.

Alongside, trading volumes tumbled 27% week-over-week, in what appears to be signs of waning short-term interest. Even so, year-to-date inflows climbed $35.2 billion, outpacing last year’s $48.5 billion annual tally by 4.2% on an annualized basis, which, according to CoinShares, points to the broader positive sentiment being intact. Ethereum Hit Hardest Although market sentiment weakened and minor outflows occurred later in the week, Bitcoin still ended with strong results, as it recorded net inflows of $524 million over the week, according to the latest edition of Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report. Ethereum, however, bore the brunt of last week’s downturn in digital asset products, posting $912 million in net outflows. Withdrawals were logged every day of the seven-day trading stretch and came from a diverse range of ETP providers, which ultimately erased monthly inflows. Despite this reversal, Ethereum still holds $11.2 billion in year-to-date inflows. On the other hand, Solana and XRP continue to post encouraging numbers. Solana has seen 21 consecutive weeks of inflows worth $1.16 billion, while XRP leads slightly with $1.22 billion. Meanwhile, Chainlink, Sui, and Cronos attracted $1 million, $0.6 million, and $0.3 million in inflows, respectively. Multi-asset products also welcomed $4.4 million in weekly inflows. Flows were highly polarized across regions during the week. The United States, for one, topped the outflow charts with $440 million, joined by Sweden’s $13.5 million and Switzerland’s $2.7 million. Germany countered with inflows of $85.1 million, while Hong Kong attracted $8.1 million. Smaller but positive inflows were also seen in Canada, Brazil, and Australia, which pulled in $4.1 million, $3.5 million, and $2.1 million, respectively. Ethereum Outflows Aren’t About Fundamentals Weighing on the pressure on Ethereum, Konstantin Anissimov, Global CEO of Currency.com, said that some of these outflows are rotations. In a statement to CryptoPotato , Anissimov added that macro anxiety amid soft labour data, recession fears push money back to Bitcoin products. The exec commented, “To many institutions, Bitcoin still looks like the ‘safer’ digital asset when markets face turbulence. By contrast, ETH is seen as a higher-beta play. That makes it the first target when risk appetite decreases.” Despite this, the exec does not believe that the “fundamentals behind Ethereum have cracked.” Anissimov went on to add, “So far, staking growth, DeFi activity, and network health remain strong. From my perspective, the size of this outflow is more about timing than conviction. If ETH stabilises and macro sentiment improves, inflows can bounce back by Q4. But if uncertainty stays strong, we could be looking at a much longer pause being a stress test for ETF investors and ETH’s price resilience.” The post Ethereum Bleeds $912M in Outflows – 7 Straight Days of Investor Exodus appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|ETHBTC|ETHUSD|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|Ethereum (ETH) Price|Ripple (XRP) Price|Solana (SOL) Price,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|BUSINESS|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-09-09 05:18:25

Meanwhile, a massive supply chain hack targeting JavaScript libraries downloaded over a billion times, but surprisingly only netted attackers less than $50 in stolen crypto. However, experts warned that the potential risks are still significant. Hackers Steal $41M in SOL from SwissBorg SwissBorg, a Switzerland-based crypto wealth management platform, confirmed that it suffered a security breach involving its staking partner Kiln that resulted in the theft of about 193,000 Solana tokens. The exploit targeted Kiln’s API, and drained funds from SwissBorg’s Solana Earn program which amounted to roughly $41 million at the time of the incident. Despite the scale of the hack, SwissBorg explained that its app and other Earn products were unaffected, with the vulnerability traced back to Kiln’s infrastructure rather than its own systems. API attacks like this one exploit the software bridge that enables communication between different systems. In this case, Kiln’s API was compromised, which allowed hackers to manipulate requests and siphon tokens meant for staking on the Solana network. SwissBorg stated that the breach only impacted users who deposited Solana into its Earn program, which makes up about 1% of its customer base and 2% of total assets under management. CEO Cyrus Fazel addressed the issue in an X Space , and admitted that the loss was big but it did not threaten the company’s overall financial stability. Cyrus Fazel during an X Space addressing the hack The Solana Earn program, powered by Kiln, was designed to make staking simple for retail investors who might not want to deal with the complexities of running validator nodes or engaging directly with DeFi protocols. While the attack was a setback, SwissBorg reassured its customers that affected users will be reimbursed. The company also pointed out that its treasury reserves were strong enough to cover losses immediately and pledged to move forward with reimbursements while continuing to work with international agencies, exchanges, and white-hat hackers to trace and block stolen funds. Blockchain data shows that the stolen assets were routed to a Solana wallet now flagged on Solscan as belonging to the “SwissBorg Exploiter.” The company advised users to avoid interacting with this address during their investigations. Fazel described the incident as “a bad day for SwissBorg,” but one that will ultimately serve as a learning experience. Despite the disruption, SwissBorg said daily operations remain unaffected, and its broader suite of crypto yield products is still intact. $50 Lost in Supply Chain Hack Meanwhile, hackers have managed to steal less than $50 worth of crypto in what researchers are calling a massive supply chain attack targeting JavaScript software libraries. According to security intelligence platform Security Alliance , attackers broke into the node package manager (NPM) account of a well-known developer and inserted malware into popular libraries downloaded more than a billion times. The breach specifically targeted Ethereum and Solana wallets, but so far the actual damage has been minimal. Security Alliance revealed that the only malicious address it has identified, an Ethereum wallet labeled “0xFc4a48,” received just a handful of tokens including ETH and several meme coins like Brett, Andy, Dork Lord, Ethervista, and Gondola. Initially, the value of the compromised funds was reported at just five cents, before climbing to around $50 as more small transfers were detected. The relatively tiny haul prompted Security Alliance to say that hackers squandered what could have been one of the most damaging supply chain exploits in the industry’s history. The attack involved packages like chalk, strip-ansi, and color-convert, which are deeply embedded in the dependency chains of countless projects. This means even developers who never installed the compromised packages directly may still be exposed if their projects depend on them indirectly. The malware that was planted appears to be a crypto-clipper, which is designed to silently swap out wallet addresses during transactions to siphon funds. Despite the low dollar impact so far, experts are urging caution. Ledger’s chief technology officer Charles Guillemet advised users to carefully verify on-chain transactions, but Ledger confirmed its hardware devices were not directly affected. Meanwhile, 0xngmi, founder of DeFiLlama, mentioned that only crypto projects that updated after the malicious NPM code was pushed are at risk, and even then, users would need to approve the compromised transactions for funds to be taken. Still, he thinks that users may want to avoid interacting with crypto websites until developers confirm that their platforms are no longer relying on infected libraries. Although the outcome so far seems like a missed opportunity for attackers, the sheer scale of the breach shed some light on the fragility of supply chain security in open-source software and how deeply even small libraries are integrated into critical crypto infrastructure.",News|Security,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|ZRX|TECHNOLOGY|ETH,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-09 05:30:00

GIWA, short for Global Infrastructure for Web3 Access, runs on the OP Stack, an open-source system managed by the Optimism Foundatio n. The blockchain delivers one-second block times, near-real-time transactions, and full support for Ethereum tools and smart contracts, so developers and users can use it easily. Upbit builds GIWA to grow South Korea’s Web3 market Upbit’s parent company, Dunamu, filed multiple trademark applications under “GIWA.” These filings hinted that the company was about to release something big, and they even added a countdown clock on the website for the Upbit Developer Conference (UDC). Users, traders, and developers were all excited for weeks, and when GIWA finally came out, it showed that Upbit was ready to move beyond being just an exchange. Like Coinbase with Base, OKX with OKChain, and Binance with its BNB Chain, Upbit ‘s new blockchain would give the platform more control over its ecosystems and support faster innovation in Web3. Upbit wants to simplify Web3 in South Korea and make it accessible for everyday users by providing a fast and affordable blockchain that easily connects with the developer tools on Ethereum. With Upbit’s influence in Korea, experts believe that many traders will jump on board if the company uses GIWA to launch new tokens. GIWA speeds up Ethereum and adds simple identity tools GIWA was designed to solve Ethereum’s slow transaction periods and high gas fees that rise when the servers are overloaded. Instead of replacing ETH, GIWA works as a Layer 2 network. This means most transactions happen on its own system and are then recorded back onto Ethereum. This way, users won’t have to deal with Ethereum’s performance issues but will still enjoy its tight security features. GIWA is also fully compatible with ETH’s system, which runs smart contracts like the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This makes it easier for developers to deploy their smart contracts from Solidity (the standard programming language for Ethereum) onto GIWA without rewriting or making big changes. They can also use the same tools and development frameworks they already know. In this way, GIWA attracts more developers looking for faster speeds and lower fees without starting from scratch. GIWA also comes with a GIWA ID built as a Soulbound Token, or SBT (a special type of token that cannot be transferred or traded once issued) for digital wallets. Users with a GIWA ID get verified, and their identity is locked to the original wallet so it cannot be sold or misused. And if a user has issues with their verification, GIWA offers a 90-day grace period for them to fix it before revocation. While GIWA is still in development, the team launched a public testnet so developers can experiment and test their applications in a live space. The testnet works on chainId 91342 through an RPC endpoint and a blockchain explorer. This means developers can connect, deploy contracts, and track transactions like in the main network.

This technical development suggests that whales, large institutional and high-net-worth investors, are actively accumulating XRP during recent market dips, setting the stage for potential upside momentum. The MFI, often referred to as a volume-weighted version of the Relative Strength Index (RSI), tracks both price and trading volume to identify overbought and oversold conditions. An MFI reading above 60 is typically interpreted as increasing buying strength, while readings above 80 may indicate overbought conditions. With XRP’s MFI climbing decisively past 60, Xaif Crypto is interpreting this as a confirmation of rising capital inflows into the asset. In other words, whales appear to be loading up on XRP at lower levels, potentially anticipating a breakout once market sentiment aligns with technical strength. This renewed buying pressure comes at a critical moment for XRP. The token has been consolidating within a tight range for weeks, with traders watching closely for signs of directional bias. Whale accumulation historically precedes larger price swings, as their significant holdings can absorb selling pressure and tilt market momentum. If accumulation continues, XRP could establish a stronger support base, giving bulls room to challenge the psychological level of $3.0 with the present price standing at $2.96. Meanwhile, SBI Holdings is driving XRP’s future with major investments, deep Ripple partnerships, and accelerating real-world adoption in global payments. Ripple’s XRP Poised to Transform SWIFT with Real-Time, Two-Way Settlement According to crypto observer SMQKE, Ripple’s technology, powered by its native asset XRP, has the potential to enhance the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) network. Traditionally, SWIFT has operated as a secure messaging system for banks and financial institutions, facilitating the communication needed to initiate and confirm cross-border transactions. However, it does not move money itself, leaving settlements to rely on correspondent banking chains that can be slow, costly, and error-prone. SMQKE highlights that Ripple’s approach could revolutionize this process by shifting SWIFT from a one-way messaging platform into a two-way communication and settlement network. Using XRP as a bridge currency, RippleNet enables direct integration with banks’ existing databases and ledgers, allowing transactions to settle in real time instead of merely being messaged and then reconciled later. This innovation would eliminate multiple intermediaries, reduce settlement risk, and cut costs associated with liquidity management. Unlike SWIFT, which only sends payment instructions requiring separate reconciliation, Ripple enables instant value transfer, validating, clearing, and settling in real time. Its two-way model keeps both sides synchronized, eliminating delays and failures common in legacy systems. Such integration could revolutionize finance, enabling banks to settle payments faster and more transparently while cutting reliance on costly nostro/vostro accounts. For businesses and consumers, it means cheaper, quicker, and more accessible cross-border transactions. In remittance-dependent regions, the impact could be truly transformative. Therefore, this convergence wouldn’t replace SWIFT but transform it from a passive messaging system into an active settlement layer. As demand for faster, cheaper, and more reliable payments accelerates, Ripple’s integration of XRP with SWIFT could redefine cross-border finance and mark a pivotal shift in the global monetary system. Conclusion Ripple’s integration of XRP into SWIFT’s framework would not simply modernize global payments, it could redefine them. By transforming SWIFT from a passive messenger into an active settlement system, Ripple offers a path toward instant, secure, and cost-efficient cross-border transactions. Meanwhile, XRP’s surge in the Money Flow Index above 60 signals more than just technical strength, it reflects growing confidence from deep-pocketed investors who are positioning themselves ahead of potential price expansion. With whales accumulating on dips and momentum steadily building, XRP is entering a phase where both technical indicators and market fundamentals align.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-09 05:51:33

Binance is once again expanding its derivatives offerings, bringing new and thrilling opportunities for traders worldwide. The recent announcement to list FLOCK and SKY perpetual futures contracts is generating considerable buzz across the crypto community, inviting both seasoned and new participants to explore these dynamic instruments. This move further solidifies Binance’s position as a leader in the cryptocurrency derivatives market, continuously innovating to meet trader demands for diverse assets and advanced trading tools. Understanding these new listings, especially within the context of Binance perpetual futures , is crucial for anyone looking to capitalize on market movements. What Are Binance Perpetual Futures, and Why Do They Matter? Perpetual futures contracts are a popular type of derivative in the cryptocurrency market. Unlike traditional futures, they do not have an expiry date, allowing traders to hold positions indefinitely. This flexibility is a significant draw for many. Binance, as a premier exchange, offers these contracts, enabling users to speculate on the price movements of various cryptocurrencies without actually owning the underlying asset. These contracts are especially appealing due to the leverage they offer. Leverage allows traders to open larger positions with a relatively small amount of capital. For the newly listed FLOCK and SKY contracts, Binance is providing up to 75x leverage. This means a small price movement can lead to significant gains, or conversely, substantial losses. Therefore, while the potential for profit is amplified, so too is the risk. Dive into FLOCK and SKY: The Latest Binance Perpetual Futures Listings Binance has officially announced the upcoming listing of FLOCK/USDT and SKY/USDT perpetual contracts. The FLOCK/USDT contract is set to go live at 6:45 a.m. UTC on September 9th. Shortly after, the SKY/USDT perpetual contract will become available for trading at 7:00 a.m. UTC on the same day. These specific timings provide traders with a clear schedule to prepare their strategies. Both listings will support up to 75x leverage, a feature that attracts high-risk, high-reward traders. The addition of FLOCK and SKY to the extensive list of Binance perpetual futures expands the options available for diversification and strategic trading. Traders can now access more niche or emerging assets within a highly liquid and robust trading environment provided by Binance. Navigating the Excitement: Benefits and Risks of Binance Perpetual Futures Trading Binance perpetual futures offers several compelling benefits. Firstly, the high leverage allows traders to maximize their capital efficiency, potentially generating higher returns from smaller market movements. Secondly, the 24/7 nature of the crypto market means these contracts can be traded at any time, offering continuous opportunities. Furthermore, perpetual futures enable traders to profit from both rising and falling markets through long and short positions. However, it is crucial to acknowledge the inherent risks. The same leverage that amplifies gains can also magnify losses, leading to rapid liquidation if the market moves against a position. Cryptocurrency markets are notoriously volatile, and sudden price swings are common. Therefore, effective risk management, including setting stop-loss orders and understanding margin requirements, is paramount for anyone engaging with Binance perpetual futures . Smart Strategies for Trading Binance Perpetual Futures To navigate the dynamic world of Binance perpetual futures effectively, consider these actionable insights: Start Small: Especially if you are new to futures trading, begin with smaller position sizes to understand market dynamics and leverage effects. Utilize Risk Management Tools: Always set stop-loss orders to limit potential losses. Furthermore, do not over-leverage, as this significantly increases liquidation risk. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, technical analysis, and fundamental developments related to FLOCK, SKY, and the broader crypto market. Practice with a Demo Account: If available, practice trading in a simulated environment before committing real capital. Diversify: While FLOCK and SKY offer new opportunities, avoid putting all your capital into a single asset. By adopting a disciplined approach and continuously learning, traders can better position themselves to capitalize on the opportunities presented by these new listings. The introduction of FLOCK and SKY perpetual futures contracts on Binance marks an exciting development for the crypto derivatives landscape. These new offerings provide traders with expanded choices and the potential for significant gains through high leverage. However, success in this volatile market hinges on a clear understanding of the instruments, diligent risk management, and a well-informed trading strategy. As the market continues to evolve, Binance remains at the forefront, offering cutting-edge tools for the modern crypto trader. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are FLOCK and SKY, and what kind of projects do they represent? FLOCK and SKY are cryptocurrencies, each representing different blockchain projects or ecosystems. While the announcement focuses on their trading availability, it’s always advisable for traders to research the underlying utility and fundamentals of any asset before trading. 2. What does ‘up to 75x leverage’ mean for traders? Up to 75x leverage means a trader can open a position worth 75 times their initial margin. For example, with $100 of capital, you can control a position worth up to $7,500. While this can amplify profits, it equally amplifies potential losses and liquidation risk. 3. Are Binance perpetual futures suitable for beginners? Perpetual futures trading, especially with high leverage, carries significant risk and is generally more suitable for experienced traders who understand market volatility and risk management. Beginners should approach with extreme caution, start with small amounts, and thoroughly educate themselves. 4. How can I manage risk when trading FLOCK and SKY perpetual futures? Effective risk management includes setting stop-loss orders to limit potential losses, using appropriate position sizing, avoiding over-leveraging, and continuously monitoring your positions. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. 5. What is the difference between a perpetual future and a traditional future? The main difference is the expiry date. Traditional futures contracts have a set expiry date, after which they settle. Perpetual futures, however, do not have an expiry date, allowing traders to hold positions indefinitely as long as they meet margin requirements.

Analysts are taking note, with some suggesting that the current demand surpasses even the early grassroots movement of Dogecoin. With an incredible $3.5 million raised and over 260 million tokens sold , Ruvi AI is quickly becoming the most talked-about AI project of the year, backed by a rapidly growing community of over 3,400 holders . Why Smart Money is Betting on a 100x Rally The extraordinary demand for Ruvi AI is rooted in its powerful combination of real-world utility and strategic market positioning. Unlike speculative assets, Ruvi AI’s credibility is firmly established. The project underwent a comprehensive security audit by CyberScope , a respected third-party firm, which verified the integrity of its smart contracts and gave investors a crucial layer of confidence. This institutional-grade security, combined with a high-profile listing on CoinMarketCap , has ignited a firestorm of interest. The presale’s success metrics are a clear indication of a project on the cusp of a major breakout, drawing comparisons to the early days of iconic cryptocurrencies. For investors, this represents a rare opportunity to get in on the ground floor of what could be a 100x phenomenon.

By solving real problems for a massive and growing user base, Ruvi AI is building intrinsic value that could fuel its journey to a 100x valuation. The Final Countdown: A 40% Price Surge Is on the Horizon The presale has now entered its highly anticipated Phase 3 , with the RUVI token priced at an attractive $0.020 . However, this window of opportunity is closing rapidly. According to the project’s tokenomics, the start of Phase 4 will trigger an automatic 40% price increase to $0.028 . This built-in price surge is creating intense FOMO, as investors rush to secure their position before the guaranteed price hike. For those targeting a 100x return, getting in during Phase 3 is a critical strategic move. WEEX Partnership and High-Reward VIP Tiers Adding to the excitement is Ruvi AI’s strategic partnership with WEEX , a major cryptocurrency exchange. This collaboration will ensure deep liquidity and seamless trading access upon launch, paving the way for rapid price discovery and attracting a wider pool of investors.

Executives are weighing a possible exit after realizing the state’s attorney general could block the company’s move to become a for-profit operation. The company’s entire future now hinges on getting regulatory approval, or risking losing nearly $19 billion in investor cash. According to reporting from The Wall Street Journal , OpenAI is being targeted by some of California’s biggest nonprofit coalitions, labor unions, and philanthropic groups. These organizations want the attorney general to investigate whether the company’s restructuring would break state charity laws. Attorneys General threaten legal action if restructure proceeds California and Delaware’s attorneys general are both investigating the proposal. They’ve got legal power to sue or demand changes if they believe OpenAI is violating nonprofit law. The office of California’s attorney general is already warning that OpenAI’s current plan may go against its original mission. The state sent a letter raising concerns, especially in light of multiple suicides reported by people who interacted with ChatGPT over extended periods. In the letter, regulators wrote, “The recent deaths are unacceptable. They have rightly shaken the American public’s confidence in OpenAI and this industry.” They told OpenAI that safety must come first. They also made it clear the company’s nonprofit status requires transparency and a public-first approach to AI deployment. Executives inside OpenAI didn’t expect this kind of pushback when they announced the restructure late last year. The intensity of the legal pressure, especially from California, has turned into a real threat. Sam Altman, who co-founded OpenAI in 2015, built the company into an $86 billion AI powerhouse, but now he’s at risk of watching it fall apart over legal technicalities. OpenAI is still run as a for-profit unit under a nonprofit parent, and that structure doesn’t sit well with big investors. They’re not getting traditional shares and want the change fast. Those investors have already promised billions, but only if the new company can legally issue stock. Without the restructure, OpenAI could lose the cash it needs to stay in the AI arms race. Projects like building custom chips, setting up new data centers, and fighting off poaching from rivals are all on the line. There’s also pressure to reduce huge yearly losses and wrestle back more control from Microsoft, which has a massive stake in the business. OpenAI hires political allies and concedes to critics OpenAI has been scrambling for political support. The company hired several advisers tied to California Governor Gavin Newsom, including former Senator Laphonza Butler. They’ve spent the summer hosting closed-door meetings with advocacy groups across the state and promised to pour $50 million into nonprofits and communities. In May, the company made a key concession. Instead of separating the nonprofit and for-profit sides, executives agreed the nonprofit would stay in charge of the new company. Internally, that was seen as a blow for Sam and his investors, but it was the only way to calm some of the opposition. Despite the changes, the heat hasn’t gone down. Meta has asked California officials to stop the restructuring. Elon Musk offered to take control of OpenAI’s assets earlier this year but got rejected. He’s now suing the company through his rival AI startup xAI , saying the restructure breaks the original nonprofit agreement. The trial is scheduled for next year, and OpenAI says the lawsuit is “baseless.” In April, a group of more than 60 nonprofits led by the San Francisco Foundation demanded an investigation into whether OpenAI has violated its federal tax-exempt status. In a letter, they warned that without enforcement, more tech startups might abuse nonprofit structures to benefit private investors. “Other startups, looking at OpenAI as a model, are likely to consider whether to take similar advantage,” they wrote. Meanwhile, OpenAI is trying to fix public concerns. Bret Taylor, chairman of the board, said they’re working on adding parental controls to ChatGPT and tackling “sycophancy,” a flaw where the AI agrees too easily with users. “We are fully committed to addressing the Attorneys General’s concerns,” Bret said.

During each bull market, investors who accumulate in quieter phases typically outperform those chasing headlines. With Bitcoin consolidating above six figures and institutional flows increasing, attention is now turning to altcoins with stronger growth potential. Analysts believe that ADA and Solana, two established projects with proven ecosystems, are still positioned for major upside. At the same time, traders are buzzing about MAGACOIN FINANCE, a presale token now being described as a possible cultural breakout with fundamentals to back it up. ADA: governance and steady growth As one of the most thoughtful and research-based blockchain initiatives, Cardano has established a solid reputation. ADA holders have previously unheard-of control over the network’s treasury and proposals thanks to its governance model, which is now entering the Voltaire era. Because of its distinct methodology, it is not merely a blockchain but rather a dynamic ecosystem that is influenced by its users. Long-term investors are drawn to ADA’s meticulously tracked progress, even though it may not be the market leader. Cardano is a smart addition for anyone planning for the next bull cycle with retirement-style horizons in mind, according to analysts, because of its emphasis on sustainability and governance, which gives it a unique kind of durability. Solana: a blend of culture and speed Solana is a symbol of energy if Cardano is a symbol of patience. With almost instantaneous transactions and prices in the fractions of a cent, Solana has emerged as one of the cryptocurrency ecosystems with the fastest rate of growth. What distinguishes Solana beyond its technical prowess is its cultural resonance. Solana is now the starting point for some of the most talked-about cryptocurrency projects, including memecoins and NFTs. According to analysts, Solana is positioned to be one of the best-performing assets of the upcoming cycle due to its speed and cultural adoption. In addition to being a platform for developers, investors view Solana as a hub for community-driven expansion, where adoption and hype reinforce one another. MAGACOIN FINANCE: the story of the dual threat With an upside potential of 50x , MAGACOIN FINANCE has recently been ranked among the top 3 coins to watch, while ADA and Solana are long-term investments with obvious advantages. Its unique status as a dual-threat token, it combines meme culture and fundamentals in a way that few projects have been able to do, is what sets it apart. The energy that drove DOGE and SHIB in previous cycles has already been tapped by MAGACOIN FINANCE, according to traders, but it has gone one step further by connecting that cultural momentum to structured tokenomics. In contrast to other meme projects that only use hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE is developing a story that will interest investors seeking a solid framework as well as retail traders seeking excitement. Accumulation strategy for 2025 For investors preparing for the next bull run, accumulation is key. This means consistently adding positions to altcoins with staying power before the cycle peaks. ADA offers resilience and governance-driven growth, while Solana provides unmatched cultural traction. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its unique dual-threat profile, adds a speculative but powerful layer of upside. Together, these assets represent different tiers of the crypto market: established leaders, fast-growing ecosystems, and early-stage disruptors. Analysts emphasize that blending these categories is how portfolios can achieve both stability and exponential returns when markets heat up. Why diversity matters in bull markets The next bull cycle will not favor just one type of project. Infrastructure coins, cultural tokens, and innovative disruptors will all have their moment. Investors who spread exposure across these categories are better positioned to capture gains while reducing risk. ADA and Solana provide proven ecosystems, while MAGACOIN FINANCE injects the kind of high-upside potential that can transform a portfolio. For those aiming to maximize returns, combining credibility with breakout opportunities is the most effective way to approach 2025’s market environment. Conclusion ADA and Solana remain two of the most compelling altcoins to hold for the upcoming bull cycle, offering governance-driven sustainability and cultural-driven speed. Yet it is MAGACOIN FINANCE – with its 50X forecasts and rare blend of meme appeal and fundamentals – that is being described as the true wildcard. For investors seeking to optimize their portfolios, the winning strategy may lie in holding a mix of trusted names and explosive new entrants, ensuring both stability and the possibility of life-changing multiples.

Here’s the Answer,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/what-does-it-take-for-bulls-to-regain-control-in-bitcoin-heres-the-answer/,"Weak US employment data, new tariffs, the war in Europe and the Middle East, and the political crisis in France have increased global uncertainties this week. While gold is climbing to record highs, Bitcoin maintains its high correlation with the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index. Cryptocurrency research firm Ecoinometrics, in its assessment of X, said, “Bitcoin's correlation regime is still tied to risky assets. The separation into digital gold has not yet occurred.” Data shows that Bitcoin's correlation with gold is near zero. It also has almost no correlation with traditional safe-haven US Treasury bonds. Ethereum, however, trades even more closely with risk assets than Bitcoin. Markets will be watching next week's Fed meeting. According to Ecoinometrics, macroeconomic uncertainty must diminish for the bull market to gain momentum. “The best-case scenario is for the Fed to confirm that it will either remain committed to its interest rate cut path or accelerate the process,” the report stated. However, if the opposite happens—a hawkish surprise—both tech stocks and Bitcoin are expected to take a hit. André Dragosch, Head of European Research at Bitwise, also stated that the volatility in the crypto market is due to macro developments, saying, “The current weak performance is not due to micro developments, but to the decline in global growth expectations and the decrease in investors’ risk appetite.” Related News: Major Hacking Incident Occurs: Large Amount of Solana (SOL) Stolen - Here Are the Details However, Dragosch stated that he remained optimistic about the medium- to long-term outlook: “I remain very bullish due to the acceleration in global liquidity growth. The Fed's continued interest rate cuts and the continued easing of financial conditions will likely create a positive environment for markets.” However, Dragosch noted that downside risks are still on the table in the short term, saying the Fed meeting has become a “double event” for Bitcoin: “An aggressive cut will send risky assets soaring, and if dovish expectations are disappointed, Bitcoin will be dragged down along with tech stocks.” *This is not investment advice.

This isn’t a distant dream; it’s becoming a reality as Ant Digital Technologies embarks on a monumental journey to put a staggering $8.4 billion worth of energy asset data on-chain . This pioneering move by the blockchain arm of China’s Ant Group signals a significant shift in how we manage and monetize green energy, promising to unlock new levels of transparency and liquidity for real-world assets. What Does Putting Energy Asset Data On-Chain Really Mean? Ant Digital Technologies is making headlines with its ambitious plan to upload 60 billion yuan, equivalent to approximately $8.43 billion, worth of energy asset data onto its proprietary AntChain blockchain. This isn’t just a small-scale pilot; it involves the operational data from more than 15 million renewable energy devices. Think about it: Wind turbines: Their performance, generation metrics, and maintenance logs. Solar panels: Their daily output, efficiency rates, and environmental impact. By bringing this vast amount of information onto a blockchain, Ant Digital aims to create an immutable, transparent, and verifiable record. This foundational step is crucial for building trust and efficiency within the renewable energy sector. Why is Energy Asset Data On-Chain a Game-Changer for Renewables? The decision to place such critical information on a blockchain isn’t just about technology; it’s about transforming an entire industry. Putting energy asset data on-chain offers several compelling benefits: Enhanced Transparency: Every data point, from energy generation to consumption, becomes auditable and verifiable. This can significantly boost confidence in green energy claims and carbon credit markets. Operational Efficiency: Streamlined data management reduces manual processes and potential errors, leading to more efficient operations for renewable energy providers. New Monetization Avenues: With verifiable data, new financial products and services can emerge, such as tokenized carbon credits or energy derivatives, creating new revenue streams. Improved Trust: An immutable record fosters greater trust among stakeholders, including investors, regulators, and consumers, by providing undeniable proof of green energy production. Ultimately, this initiative has the potential to accelerate the global transition to sustainable energy by making the entire ecosystem more robust and accountable. Unlocking Liquidity: Real-World Assets and Energy Asset Data On-Chain Beyond simply recording data, Ant Group is exploring an even more revolutionary aspect: linking this data to real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. The company recently completed a substantial 300 million yuan ($42.1 million) funding round, indicating serious intent. The goal is to issue related tokens on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). This means: Real-World Assets (RWAs): These are tangible or intangible assets from the physical world, like real estate, art, or in this case, the value derived from renewable energy production, that are represented on a blockchain. Increased Liquidity: By tokenizing these assets, they can be traded more easily and efficiently on blockchain networks, opening them up to a wider pool of investors. This innovative approach to energy asset data on-chain could unlock immense liquidity for renewable energy projects, making it easier for them to attract investment and expand. However, it is crucial to note that this ambitious plan is currently pending regulatory approval, a common hurdle in the evolving landscape of blockchain finance. The Future of Green Energy: Blockchain’s Crucial Role Ant Digital’s move to put energy asset data on-chain is more than just a corporate strategy; it’s a potential blueprint for the future of sustainable finance and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing. If successful, this initiative could set a global precedent for how renewable energy assets are managed, verified, and monetized. The implications are far-reaching, potentially leading to: A standardized, transparent system for carbon accounting. Easier access to capital for green energy developers. Greater investor confidence in sustainable projects. While challenges such as scalability, regulatory clarity, and interoperability remain, the pioneering efforts of companies like Ant Digital are paving the way for a more integrated and efficient green economy powered by blockchain technology. In conclusion, Ant Digital Technologies is not just talking about the future of green energy; it is actively building it. By committing to put a massive $8.4 billion worth of energy asset data on-chain , the company is demonstrating the transformative power of blockchain. This move promises to usher in an era of unprecedented transparency, efficiency, and liquidity for the renewable energy sector, ultimately benefiting both the economy and the planet.

XRP Binance Open Interest Has Dropped To $1.1 Billion As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post , XRP traders on Binance have closed off futures market positions recently. The indicator of relevance here’s the “ Open Interest ,” which measures the total amount of derivatives positions related to XRP that are currently open on a given exchange. When the value of the metric goes up, it means users are setting up fresh positions on the platform. Generally, the total leverage in the sector increases when new positions pop up, so this kind of trend can lead to the asset’s price behaving in a more volatile manner. On the other hand, the indicator observing a decline suggests traders are either closing up positions of their own volition or getting forcibly liquidated by the exchange. The cryptocurrency may become more stable following such a trend, due to the reduced leverage. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the XRP Open Interest for the largest digital asset exchange by trading volume, Binance: As displayed in the above graph, the XRP Binance Open Interest saw a sharp surge between late 2024 and early 2025, implying the price surge was accompanied by a wave of speculative positioning from the investors. As bullish momentum cooled off, mass liquidations took place and investors started pulling back on their positions, leading to a plummet in the indicator. From the chart, it’s visible that the metric remained at its lows until the rally in July. This price surge was once again accompanied by a burst of speculative interest in the XRP market, but the Open Interest spike lasted only briefly as another deleveraging event soon followed. At its peak in July, the metric hit the $1.76 billion mark, but today, it has come down to $1.1 billion, implying a significant decline of over 37%. Though, while the drawdown has been steep, the indicator’s current value is still high when compared to the past. “The stabilization of OI near $1.1 billion after the peak, along with the price’s decline from its highs, indicates a repositioning phase,” explains the quant. “Leveraged positions remain in the market, but at a lower level than during the July/August peak.” Where the XRP Open Interest heads next may be interesting to watch, as it could have a direct impact on the stability of the market. A surge from here without a price rally, for instance, would make traders more vulnerable to a long squeeze . XRP Price XRP has enjoyed a price jump of more than 3.5% over the last 24 hours that has taken its price to the $2.93 level.",XRP|binance|XRP futures|XRP Open interest|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|EXCHANGE|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-09 06:00:40

According to market analysis firm Bull Theory, the forthcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting is on the horizon, and its outcome will largely hinge on the economic data released this week. Stability Or Further Pressure For Crypto? The Federal Reserve (Fed) has two primary mandates: to maintain inflation around 2% and to support employment levels. Currently, the landscape appears challenging, with rising unemployment juxtaposed against persistent inflation. Related Reading: Solana Rally in Sight? Traders Eye Breakout That Could Push SOL Toward $250 On September 9, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will revise the previous year’s non-farm payrolls (NFP). This annual revision often reveals downward adjustments, indicating weaker job growth than initially reported. For instance, last August, the revision was significantly lower than expected, with a downward adjustment of 818,000 jobs—the second worst in US history. This prompted the Fed to implement a more aggressive 50 basis point cut instead of the anticipated 25 basis points. If this repeats, it could raise the likelihood of another substantial cut, which would be viewed positively for liquidity and, by extension, the crypto market. The Producer Price Index (PPI) report, scheduled for September 10, will provide insights into inflation at the business level. A PPI reading that meets or falls below expectations is likely to boost market sentiment, while a higher-than-expected figure could dampen it. Last month, the PPI was unexpectedly high, coinciding with Bitcoin’s (BTC) peak near $124,000 before it began to cool. A softer PPI this time could grant the Fed more leeway to implement cuts, alleviating pressure on cryptocurrencies. Three Scenarios For Fed’s Upcoming Rate Cut Decision Following that, on September 11, the Consumer Price Index (CPI), a key inflation gauge, will be released. If CPI readings come in hotter than anticipated, it complicates the Fed’s decision-making process. For the crypto market, a CPI result at or below expectations would be the most favorable outcome. Also on September 11, initial jobless claims will be reported, indicating how many individuals filed for unemployment benefits last week. A higher-than-expected figure would signal weakness in the job market, thereby increasing pressure on the Fed to act. As all eyes turn to the FOMC meeting, the data collected this week will be instrumental in determining whether the Fed opts for a 25 basis point or a more aggressive 50 basis point cut. Related Reading: Dogecoin Leads Altcoin Rally Amid ETF Speculation: Is $1.50 the Next Big Target? There are three potential scenarios that could unfold. The first, a larger cut of 50 basis points, is likely if the NFP is sharply revised downwards, CPI and PPI data are soft, and jobless claims are high. This scenario, which indicates a rapidly weakening economy, could provide robust liquidity support for the market. However, the Bull Theory estimates this outcome has a 20%-25% probability. The second scenario, a standard cut of 25 basis points, appears more probable, with a 70%-74% chance. This would occur if NFP revisions are moderately weaker, CPI is slightly elevated, and jobless claims remain steady. While this would still be positive for crypto, it may not yield the same liquidity burst as a 50 basis point cut. Lastly, a scenario where the Fed pauses or delays changes is also possible. The firm asserts that if NFP data holds steady, CPI readings are hotter than expected, and jobless claims decrease, the Fed might take a more cautious approach, potentially leading to short-term pressures and further consolidation for Bitcoin and altcoins.

Speaking at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok on Monday, he alleged that the US is “trying to rewrite the rules of the gold and cryptocurrency markets.” Remember the size of their debt — $35 trillion. These two sectors are essentially alternatives to the traditional global currency system,” Kobyakov said. Per the US Treasury data , the nation’s debt is more than $37 trillion now, which stood at $18.15 trillion ten years ago. The nation has seen a 10-fold increase in its debt since 1981. Further, he stated that Washington is attempting to solve its financial problems at the world’s expense. The nation’s debt will eventually be shifted into USD stablecoins to devalue it, he noted. This will ultimately shrink what it owns, allowing the US to “start from scratch,” Kobyakov added. He warned that this would push the world into what he calls the “crypto cloud.” The US Has a History of Debt Issues – Kobyakov Draws Historical Parallels According to Kobyakov, the current crisis is similar to two earlier resets in U.S. monetary history. The government was pushed to take unusual steps in the 1930s during the Great Depression. He also highlighted President Nixon’s 1970s decision to end the dollar’s final link to gold. “As in the 1930s and the 1970s, the US plans to solve its financial problems at the world’s expense,” he said, per a translated transcript.

The US is Building Crypto Frameworks The US has been laying out rules for digital assets, with officials floating the idea of holding crypto as part of national reserves. For instance, Senator Cynthia Lummis said in May that Bitcoin “is the only solution” to the US’s $36 trillion debt. She promoted the BITCOIN Act, which urges the government to buy 1 million Bitcoin in the next five years and hold it for 20 years. Besides, US officials note that the stablecoin framework will focus more on ensuring that the USD remains a dominant currency. Scott Bessent, Secretary of the Treasury and a supporter of the GENIUS bill, has claimed it could help reduce the national debt . However, the debate is that it might have an opposite effect on the national debt. Stablecoins would increase demand for Treasuries, which means more debt issuance.

He described the current situation as a “waiting game,” emphasizing that the Fed’s decision on interest rate cuts will directly influence overall market liquidity and, consequently, the price movement of XRP. Hilton explained that the Federal Reserve is expected to announce a reduction in interest rates, with his view being that a quarter-basis point cut is the most likely outcome. He added that a more aggressive 50 basis point cut would be a significant shock to markets, but did not expect that scenario to unfold. In his analysis, he projected that the Fed may implement at least one additional rate cut before the end of the year, and potentially as many as two, bringing the total number of reductions to three by the close of 2025. XRP Holders! Now We Wait! This IS Going To Impact YOU and YOUR XRP! pic.twitter.com/QGJqyEj5QT — Austin Hilton (@austinahilton) September 7, 2025 Short-Term Outlook for XRP Price According to Hilton, XRP’s price action is not expected to experience major developments in the days leading up to the Fed’s announcement. He observed that XRP is currently trading within a consolidation range between $2.80 and $3.30 and suggested that this range would likely persist until September 17. Although he acknowledged that XRP could climb back above $3, Hilton emphasized that substantial price shifts are unlikely in the short term, given the market’s anticipation of the Fed’s decision. Despite these near-term limitations, Hilton highlighted XRP’s 3% daily gain at the time of his video, noting that while modest, such increases are preferable to declines. He reiterated that until the Federal Reserve provides macroeconomic clarity, traders should expect XRP to remain confined within its existing trading boundaries. Longer-Term Projections and Market Expectations Looking beyond September, Hilton predicted that the final quarter of the year could bring significant bullish momentum to the cryptocurrency market. He said that October could mark the beginning of a gradual upward movement for XRP, with late October through December being the period where he expects a strong bull run to take shape. In his forecast, Hilton projected that Bitcoin could rise to between $150,000 and $200,000 during this period. For XRP, he stated that a price range of $10 to $20 is possible, representing a 3 to 7x increase from current levels. He stressed that such outcomes remain within the realm of possibility as broader market conditions shift with central bank policy adjustments and renewed capital flows into digital assets. Continued Accumulation and Personal Strategy Hilton disclosed that he has been consistently adding to his XRP holdings, purchasing more of the asset every week. He described the current market conditions as an attractive entry point for accumulation, while clarifying that his statements should not be taken as financial advice. In his view, September is best understood as a transitional month in which patience will be required before more favorable conditions develop in the fourth quarter. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Hilton closed his video by reiterating that XRP holders should remain aware that the asset’s next significant movement will be tied closely to the Federal Reserve’s rate cut decisions. Until then, he believes the cryptocurrency will continue to move within its established trading range, with broader momentum resuming in the final months of the year.

Recent news regarding a significant $41.5 million SOL exploit might have raised concerns, but crypto trading and analysis app SwissBorg has swiftly moved to reassure its community: your SwissBorg funds safe . This incident, while notable, was not a breach of SwissBorg’s core platform, but rather an exploit of an external DeFi wallet used for a specific yield strategy. This distinction is crucial for understanding the event’s true nature and SwissBorg’s robust response. What Exactly Happened with the $41.5M SOL Exploit? Understanding the details of such events is crucial for all crypto participants. SwissBorg clarified that the $41.5 million SOL exploit specifically targeted a decentralized finance (DeFi) yield strategy. This strategy involved interacting with a third-party DeFi protocol and utilized an external wallet, not SwissBorg’s internal, custodial infrastructure. It is important to highlight: The incident was not a hack of SwissBorg’s internal systems , security protocols, or user accounts held directly on their platform. The exploit impacted a third-party DeFi protocol that SwissBorg had integrated to offer a particular SOL investment opportunity. Only user funds specifically allocated to this external, high-yield strategy were exposed to the exploit. This situation underscores the inherent complexities and risks associated with the broader DeFi ecosystem, where interactions across various external protocols can introduce vulnerabilities. However, SwissBorg’s immediate and transparent communication focused on mitigating user impact and ensuring their SwissBorg funds safe . How Does SwissBorg Ensure Your SwissBorg Funds Safe ? The company’s commitment to user protection shines through its proactive and decisive stance. Following the exploit, SwissBorg quickly conducted a thorough assessment, confirming that all other investment products and the vast majority of user funds held on their platform remain completely unaffected and secure. Crucially, SwissBorg has made an unwavering pledge: No user will incur financial losses directly attributable to this specific external incident. SwissBorg is committed to covering any unrecovered losses from the exploit using its own reserves. This demonstrates a powerful commitment to client asset protection. The platform’s robust internal security measures, which safeguard its core operations and direct user holdings, were never compromised . This decisive action reinforces trust and demonstrates SwissBorg’s strong dedication to maintaining the integrity and security of user assets. Their rapid response and commitment to compensation ensure that for their community, keeping SwissBorg funds safe is not just a promise, but a reality. Navigating DeFi: Crucial Lessons for Protecting Your Crypto Assets While SwissBorg has swiftly taken responsibility for the exploit’s impact on its users, this event serves as a broader reminder about the importance of understanding the inherent risks within the decentralized finance space. DeFi offers groundbreaking opportunities for yield and financial innovation, but it also comes with a unique set of complexities and potential vulnerabilities. For all cryptocurrency users, it is always prudent to: Conduct thorough due diligence: Always research and understand the specific protocols, smart contracts, and strategies you engage with. Practice diversification: Avoid placing all your capital into a single high-yield or experimental strategy. Spreading investments across different platforms and asset classes can mitigate risk. Stay informed: Keep abreast of the latest security news, platform updates, and community discussions within the crypto space. SwissBorg’s transparency and rapid resolution in this case set a high standard for how reputable platforms should respond to such challenges. By acting decisively to protect their community, they not only ensure their SwissBorg funds safe but also contribute to building greater confidence and stability in the wider crypto ecosystem. This incident, while unfortunate, ultimately showcases the importance of choosing platforms with strong security protocols and a clear commitment to user protection. In conclusion, the $41.5 million SOL exploit was a significant event, but SwissBorg’s swift and responsible response has ensured that its users are protected. By clarifying that the incident was an external DeFi wallet exploit and committing to cover all unrecovered losses, SwissBorg has reinforced its dedication to security and user trust. This proactive approach ensures that for SwissBorg users, their SwissBorg funds safe and secure, allowing them to continue their crypto journey with peace of mind. This commitment highlights why choosing a trusted platform is essential in the evolving world of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Was SwissBorg itself hacked? A1: No, SwissBorg’s core platform and internal systems were not hacked. The incident was an exploit of an external DeFi wallet used for a specific SOL yield strategy, not a breach of SwissBorg’s direct infrastructure. Q2: Are my funds on SwissBorg safe if I wasn’t using the SOL yield strategy? A2: Yes, absolutely.

Initial Discovery: The attack was first detected through a cryptic build failure in a CI/CD pipeline, specifically a ReferenceError: fetch is not defined . This error occurred because the malware’s attempt to exfiltrate data via a fetch call failed in an older Node.js environment that lacked the global fetch function. Root Cause: The attacker gained control of the qix NPM account, allowing them to publish malicious patch versions of key libraries. Vast Impact: The compromised packages are fundamental building blocks of countless projects, often buried deep within dependency trees. Key affected packages and their approximate weekly downloads include: chalk : ~ 300 million strip-ansi : ~ 261 million color-convert : ~ 193 million color-name : ~ 191 million is-core-module : ~ 69 million error-ex : ~ 47 million simple-swizzle : ~ 26 million has-ansi : ~ 12 million How Does the Crypto-Clipper Malware from the NPM Attack Steal Funds? The malicious code, a sophisticated “crypto-clipper,” is designed to steal cryptocurrency by targeting user transactions and wallet interactions. It operates using a two-pronged strategy: Passive Address Swapping : The malware “monkey-patches” the browser’s native fetch and XMLHttpRequest functions to intercept all network traffic. It contains a list of attacker-owned wallet addresses for currencies like Bitcoin (BTC) , Ethereum (ETH) , Solana (SOL) , Tron (TRX) , Litecoin (LTC) , and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) . Using the Levenshtein distance algorithm , the script finds the attacker’s address that is typographically most similar to the user’s legitimate one, making the substitution difficult for the human eye to detect. Active Transaction Hijacking : If the malware detects a browser-based wallet like MetaMask by checking for window.ethereum , it hijacks the wallet’s communication methods ( request , send ). When a user initiates a transaction, the malware modifies the data in memory, replacing the legitimate recipient’s address with a hardcoded attacker’s address. The user then unknowingly signs a fraudulent transaction, redirecting their funds to the attacker. Tracking the Attack: The transparency of blockchains allows for the monitoring of these fraudulent transactions. One of the primary Ethereum addresses used by the attacker is 0xFc4a4858bafef54D1b1d7697bfb5c52F4c166976 . A complete list of compromised wallets is available in a public GitHub Gist . What Immediate Steps Can Developers Take to Protect Their Projects? While NPM and the open-source community are actively working to remediate the attack by removing malicious versions, compromised packages may still exist in project dependencies or lock files. To protect your projects, developers must take these immediate, critical steps: Audit Your Dependencies : Immediately check your project’s package-lock.json or yarn.lock file to identify any use of the affected packages. Pin to Safe Versions : Use the overrides feature in your package.json file to force npm to use known-safe versions of the compromised packages. This is crucial for fixing transitive dependencies. Example package.json configuration: JSON { ""name"" : ""your-project"" , ""version"" : ""1.0.0"" , ""overrides"" : { ""chalk"" : ""5.3.0"" , ""strip-ansi"" : ""7.1.0"" , ""color-convert"" : ""2.0.1"" , ""color-name"" : ""1.1.4"" , ""is-core-module"" : ""2.13.1"" , ""error-ex"" : ""1.3.2"" , ""has-ansi"" : ""5.0.1"" }} Clean and Reinstall : After adding the overrides, delete your node_modules folder and package-lock.json file. Then, run npm install to generate a new, clean lock file with the pinned, safe versions. This ensures that no vulnerable code remains in your project’s environment. Why is the qix NPM account compromise a significant supply-chain security threat? The compromise of the qix NPM account is a critical threat because it allowed an attacker to inject malicious code into extremely popular, foundational JavaScript packages. These libraries are not typically direct dependencies but are pulled in by hundreds or thousands of other packages. This vast and invisible dependency tree meant the malicious code could spread to millions of applications and developer machines with minimal friction, weaponizing the inherent trust within the open-source ecosystem. What is a “crypto-clipper” and how does it relate to the September 2025 NPM attack? A “crypto-clipper” is a type of malware that hijacks cryptocurrency transactions. In the context of the NPM attack, the malicious code injected into packages like chalk and strip-ansi acts as a crypto-clipper. It silently monitors web traffic and clipboard data, specifically looking for crypto wallet addresses. When a user copies or initiates a transaction, the clipper swaps the legitimate recipient address with the attacker’s, rerouting funds and causing financial loss without the user’s immediate knowledge. How can a simple build error uncover a sophisticated supply-chain attack? In this attack, a seemingly minor build error, a ReferenceError: fetch is not defined , was the first indicator of a deep-rooted problem. This error occurred because the malware’s data exfiltration attempt relied on a modern browser function that was not present in an older Node.js environment. The failure to execute its payload made the malicious code visible, highlighting how even a simple configuration mismatch or an outdated environment can inadvertently act as a tripwire for sophisticated, obfuscated attacks. The qix NPM account attack serves as a stark reminder that the open-source ecosystem, despite its collaborative nature, is a major target for sophisticated cyber threats. The vulnerability exposed is not just a technical flaw but a systemic risk stemming from the trust placed in third-party dependencies. Organizations must move beyond basic security practices and adopt a proactive, vigilant stance that includes hardening CI/CD pipelines , implementing strict dependency management policies , and fostering a security-first culture. Failing to act now leaves projects exposed to similar threats that can compromise intellectual property, user data, and financial assets on a massive scale.

According to the announcement, the company now holds 2,069,443 ETH at $4,312, 192 Bitcoin (BTC), and unencumbered cash worth $266 million. This achievement is part of the company’s goal to hold 5% of Ethereum’s total supply, now controlling 1.71%, worth $8.5 billion. BitMine’s chairman, Thomas “Tom” Lee, stated, “BitMine has surpassed the 2 million ETH milestone this past week. As we mentioned in our August Chairman’s message, the convergence of both Wall Street moving onto the blockchain and AI/ agentic-AI creating a token economy is creating a supercycle for Ethereum. And the power law benefits large holders of ETH, hence, we pursue the ‘alchemy of 5%’ of ETH.” “At BitMine, we are leading our crypto treasury peers by both the velocity of raising crypto NAV per share and by the high trading liquidity of our stock,” Lee added. It’s worth noting that the company became the third-largest crypto treasury and the largest Ethereum Treasury in the world after hitting the 1.15 million ETH milestone just last month. Since then, the company has continued to accumulate nearly another million ETH and has become the second-largest crypto treasury, now only behind Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which holds 636,505 Bitcoin, worth $71 billion at current prices. “We continue to believe Ethereum is one of the biggest macro trades over the next 10-15 years,” continued Lee in the announcement. “Wall Street and AI moving onto the blockchain should lead to a greater transformation of today’s financial system. And the majority of this is taking place on Ethereum.” Strengthening ETH’s Ecosystem BitMine also revealed it has made a $20 million strategic investment into Eightco Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: OCTO) as part of OCTO’s $270 million private investment in public equity (PIPE). On September 8, Eightco announced it plans to adopt Worldcoin (WLD), an ERC20 asset, as its primary treasury holding. Notably, the strategic investment marks the start of the company’s “Moonshot” strategy, which aims to allocate around 1% of BitMine’s balance sheet into projects to strengthen the Ethereum ecosystem and create value for BitMine equity shareholders. According to the statement, BitMine is now one of the most widely traded stocks in the US, with an average daily volume of $1.7 billion, according to 5-day average data from Fundstrat. The company’s stock has also been favored by international retail investors over the past few months, with hundreds of millions of dollars being poured into BitMine, which is seen as a proxy for Ethereum. As reported by Bitcoinist, South Korean investors purchased $259 million worth of Bitmine stock in July, amid a shift from big US Tech companies’ stock to crypto-related equities. This made the company the most purchased foreign security stock, according to Korea Securities Depository data. The trend continued in August as South Korean individual investors sold approximately $657 million of Tesla stock while investing $426 million into BitMine.",Crypto News|bitcoin|Bitcoin treasury companies|Bitmine ETh Holdings|BitMine Immersion Technologies Inc.|btc|ETH|Ethereum|Ethereum Bitmine|Ethereum Treasury companies|ETHUSDT|Strategy|Tom Lee|WLD,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|REGULATION|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-09 07:00:57

The researcher captioned the statement with a screenshot from a WEF report that outlined the benefits and use cases of tokenized assets. The image shows how tokenization can reshape private equity markets and improve access, transparency, and efficiency. More importantly for XRP holders, the document included XRPL as one of the platforms already engaged in this type of financial innovation. WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM: THE XRPL IS CURRENTLY BEING USED TO TOKENIZE DEBT Documented. https://t.co/uq0SCm5w3f pic.twitter.com/4jn4kUl8Lf — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) September 8, 2025 The Significance of Debt Tokenization Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization is a process that converts traditional financial instruments and other assets into digital assets recorded on a blockchain. By doing so, institutions can create more efficient systems for the issuance, settlement, and management of obligations. The WEF report outlined benefits such as enhanced information symmetry, operational efficiency, and expanded accessibility. These attributes align with the broader push toward digitizing financial markets to improve liquidity and transparency. XRP is already involved in multiple tokenization projects , and its inclusion in this context signals that established global institutions recognize its utility in high-level financial applications. Debt markets are enormous, and any serious integration of blockchain-based tokenization has the potential to expand XRP’s role in global finance . Implications for XRP’s Future The fact that XRPL is referenced in a WEF document highlights its adoption beyond retail trading or speculative markets. It places the ledger within a framework of real-world financial infrastructure. This association with debt tokenization suggests that XRP’s underlying technology could become an integral part of processes that involve trillions of dollars in assets. While the WEF’s report did not provide exhaustive details about the scale or specific implementations, the mention itself is significant. It points toward institutional recognition and potential pathways where XRPL could serve as the foundation for digitizing complex financial products. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why This Matters for Investors For XRP supporters, the acknowledgment that XRPL is being used to tokenize debt strengthens the narrative that Ripple’s ecosystem is aligned with institutional adoption. Instead of remaining solely a cross-border payments solution, the ledger is demonstrating versatility in handling different types of assets. This diversification may increase confidence in its long-term utility and relevance. The integration of blockchain technology into debt markets is still under development. However, with XRPL already documented in this space, XRP gains visibility in discussions that go beyond speculative cycles. The potential for broader application in tokenizing traditional finance instruments presents a positive outlook for its adoption.

Imagine a new wave of startups specializing in Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), or even tokenized real-world assets, all flourishing under a more favorable regulatory umbrella. This could truly ignite the next phase of digital economic growth. However, with new freedoms always come new responsibilities. Venture firms eagerly entering the expanded South Korea crypto trading space will still need to navigate a complex and evolving regulatory environment. While the MSS has commendably opened this crucial door, it’s highly probable that other financial regulators will introduce specific guidelines for virtual asset businesses. These guidelines will undoubtedly focus on critical areas such as robust investor protection, stringent anti-money laundering (AML) protocols, and comprehensive know-your-customer (KYC) compliance. Potential challenges might include: Adapting to Regulatory Nuances: Firms must remain exceptionally vigilant and stay abreast of evolving financial regulations that extend beyond the MSS’s immediate purview. Managing Market Volatility: The inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies continues to pose significant risks that firms must manage with sophisticated strategies and careful planning. Intense Talent Acquisition: A rapidly growing industry demands highly skilled professionals. Consequently, competition for top talent in blockchain development, cybersecurity, and financial analysis could be fierce. Despite these challenges, the overarching sentiment within the industry is one of profound optimism. This thoughtful policy adjustment by the MSS is a clear and resounding signal that South Korea is ready to embrace the future of finance, fostering a significantly more dynamic and innovative environment for virtual asset businesses and driving the future of South Korea crypto trading . A Brighter Future for South Korea Crypto Trading? The decision by South Korea’s Ministry of SMEs and Startups to lift restrictions on virtual asset trading and brokerage for venture firms is truly a landmark move. It reflects a mature understanding of the virtual asset industry’s consistent growth and its immense potential to drive economic innovation. By removing these long-standing barriers, South Korea is not just opening doors for businesses; it’s signaling a profound commitment to becoming a global leader in the digital economy. This strategic shift will undoubtedly foster a more vibrant, competitive, and innovative ecosystem for South Korea crypto trading , benefiting both established players and emerging startups alike.

External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said, “Our biggest trade deficits are with BRICS partners,” during a virtual summit that didn’t include Prime Minister Modi, who had just returned from the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in China. That visit was seen as a signal that India might be warming up to Beijing, even while tensions with Washington grow. While India pushed for economic correction, the rest of the BRICS countries didn’t hold back either. Brazil, which hosted the meeting, called the U.S. tariffs “blackmail.” Trump’s tariffs have slammed both countries with taxes as high as 50%, far worse than the 30% he slapped on Chinese products. The BRICS bloc, which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, has been accused by Trump of running “anti-American policies.” Jaishankar calls out trade imbalance with BRICS nations India said that the trade gap with China is getting out of control, as India’s trade deficit with Beijing hit $99.21 billion, an all-time high. Moreover, Chinese customs data released on Monday shows China scored a $77.7 billion surplus with India just by August, up 16% from last year. Imports from China keep going up, and New Delhi isn’t thrilled. “The BRICS itself can set an example by reviewing trade flows among its member states,” Jaishankar said. He also made it clear that India has been demanding “expeditious solutions” to fix these one-sided trade numbers. The story is the same with Russia. India’s trade with Moscow hit $68.7 billion this fiscal year, and most of that is driven by oil imports. But that number comes with a catch—India ran a $59 billion deficit in that deal too. This isn’t just about numbers. India’s message to BRICS was political too. Unlike China and Russia, who see BRICS as a power group to challenge the West, India views it as mainly an economic network. According to Chietigj Bajpaee from Chatham House, India wants business solutions, not geopolitical drama. But China had its own message. Xi Jinping didn’t name the U.S. directly but warned about “hegemonism, unilateralism, and protectionism.” He said trade wars like this “severely disrupt the world economy and undermine international trade rules.” He pushed BRICS to stand together and resist rising tariffs globally. U.S. tariffs hit India harder than China as talks stall The India-U.S. situation keeps getting messier. Trump’s team has thrown a brutal 50% tariff on Indian goods, far above the 30% applied to China. That’s triggered serious tension between Washington and New Delhi. Talks between the two have stalled. Why? The U.S. wants India to stop buying oil from Russia and open up sensitive sectors like agriculture and dairy, but India says the pressure is unfair. Trump recently claimed India offered to drop tariffs on American goods to zero. But he brushed it off, saying it came “too late” in negotiations. That’s despite India saying it was still willing to talk. Even with all the finger-pointing, Trump tried to calm things down. From the Oval Office, he said the U.S. and India have a “special relationship” and added there’s “nothing to worry.” He called Modi a “great prime minister.” Modi responded on X (formerly Twitter), writing, “deeply appreciate and fully reciprocate President Trump’s sentiments and positive assessment of our ties.” Chietigj Bajpaee didn’t ignore the diplomacy but said it doesn’t erase the underlying problems. He said those friendly comments show the relationship still has strong bones, even if the surface is bruised. India still sees the U.S. as a key player in tech, defense, and strategy, and Washington sees India as a counter to China’s rise. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Traders and investors are now closely monitoring price action, as the structure suggests that any decisive move higher could force bears to cover, fueling further gains. A short squeeze occurs when heavily shorted assets rise in price, forcing traders who bet against them to buy back their positions in order to avoid deeper losses. This wave of buying often compounds upward momentum, pushing prices even higher in a short time frame. With shorts stacked around the $3.18 zone, XRP may be on the verge of such a move if bullish catalysts align. The $3.18 level is a critical pressure point. Heavy short interest makes it a resistance zone, but once broken with strong volume, it can trigger a cascade of liquidations, fueling a rapid surge into higher price ranges. XRP’s outlook has brightened in recent weeks, fueled by rising whale accumulation, improving market sentiment, and growing institutional appetite for digital assets. Speculation over a potential XRP ETF adds further momentum, while Coinglass data reinforces a technical setup primed for a breakout. For now, the spotlight is on XRP’s approach to this crucial zone. Should the asset gather enough momentum to challenge $3.18, the market could witness a cascading effect of short covering, potentially unlocking rapid price acceleration from the present $2.99 level . XRP ETF Momentum Builds as Institutional Interest Surges According to market analyst Xaif Crypto, interest around XRP is intensifying after Bloomberg Senior Analyst James Seyffart highlighted the rising institutional interest in XRP futures and exchange-traded products. Seyffart noted that these offerings, which came to market after Solana’s futures and product launches, are already generating stronger traction. This unexpected growth signals that XRP could evolve into a long-term institutional favorite. Futures and exchange-traded products (ETPs) play a critical role in shaping the institutional narrative for digital assets. They provide regulated and liquid exposure to cryptocurrencies without the complexities of direct custody. For XRP, this step forward could represent more than just a short-term boost, it could establish the asset as a credible option for professional investors seeking to diversify their portfolios. While Solana’s futures and ETPs have gained strong momentum, XRP’s even greater traction highlights its unique edge in the crypto ecosystem. Built for real-time, low-cost global payments and backed by Ripple’s expanding partnerships with banks and financial institutions, XRP offers utility beyond speculation, making it an increasingly attractive long-term play for institutions. An XRP ETF could be a game-changer. Unlike ETPs, ETFs offer greater accessibility, liquidity, and regulatory clarity, making them far more attractive to mainstream investors. Approval would open the door for large funds, asset managers, and retirement portfolios to gain seamless exposure, potentially unleashing significant new demand. For institutions already dabbling in XRP futures and ETPs, an ETF represents the natural next step. Conclusion The rise of XRP futures and exchange-traded products signals a decisive shift in institutional sentiment. With Ripple’s proven utility in global payments and growing regulatory clarity, XRP is evolving beyond speculation, emerging as a credible asset for institutional portfolios. Meanwhile, XRP faces a high-stakes setup as shorts cluster above $3.18. Even a modest wave of buying could trigger a cascading short squeeze, unleashing outsized price moves.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-09 07:24:21

Binance, the leading global exchange, has officially announced the highly anticipated Binance USDe listing for spot trading. This development, effective today at 12:00 p.m. UTC, marks a crucial moment for Ethena’s synthetic dollar and the broader digital asset ecosystem. Traders and investors are eagerly preparing to engage with this innovative new offering. What Exactly is USDe, and Why Does it Matter? Ethena’s USDe is not just another stablecoin; it’s an innovative “synthetic dollar” protocol built on Ethereum. Unlike traditional stablecoins backed by fiat reserves, USDe maintains its peg through a delta-hedging strategy involving staked Ethereum and corresponding short perpetual futures positions. This unique approach allows it to be censorship-resistant, scalable, and potentially yield-bearing through its ‘sUSDe’ staking mechanism. The Binance USDe listing significantly amplifies its reach. The significance of USDe lies in its attempt to provide a truly decentralized, on-chain, and scalable stablecoin solution. It aims to circumvent some of the centralization risks associated with fiat-backed alternatives. Furthermore, its yield-generating capability offers an attractive proposition for users seeking returns within the DeFi space. Unlocking New Trading Opportunities with Binance’s Listing Binance’s decision to add USDe to its spot trading pairs opens up a world of new opportunities for millions of users globally. The exchange’s immense liquidity and vast user base will provide unprecedented exposure for USDe, potentially driving its adoption and integration across various DeFi protocols. This Binance USDe listing makes it far easier for everyday crypto enthusiasts to access and trade this innovative asset. Increased Accessibility: Users can now easily buy, sell, and trade USDe directly on Binance. Enhanced Liquidity: Expect deeper liquidity pools for USDe, leading to tighter spreads and better execution for trades. Broader Market Integration: The listing could pave the way for USDe to be used in more trading pairs and financial products on Binance. This move underscores Binance’s commitment to listing cutting-edge projects that bring innovation to the crypto market. It also reflects a growing interest in alternative stablecoin designs beyond the traditional models. What Are the Potential Benefits for Traders? For traders, the Binance USDe listing means more options for diversification and yield generation. If USDe’s synthetic dollar mechanism proves robust and its yield attractive, it could become a staple in many crypto portfolios. Moreover, its presence on Binance might lead to increased arbitrage opportunities across different exchanges as liquidity adjusts. However, it is crucial for traders to understand the underlying mechanics of USDe. While designed for stability, synthetic assets carry their own set of risks, including smart contract vulnerabilities, liquidation risks from hedging strategies, and potential de-pegging events under extreme market conditions. Due diligence is always recommended before engaging with any new asset. Navigating the Future: USDe and the Stablecoin Landscape The introduction of USDe on Binance could reshape the stablecoin landscape. As regulatory scrutiny on traditional stablecoins intensifies, decentralized alternatives like USDe might gain more traction. This Binance USDe listing is a strong endorsement from a major exchange, signaling confidence in Ethena’s innovative approach. The coming months will reveal how USDe performs under various market conditions and how the broader crypto community embraces it. Its success could inspire further innovation in stablecoin design, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in decentralized finance. Conclusion: A Milestone for Decentralized Finance The official Binance USDe listing is more than just another token addition; it represents a significant milestone for decentralized finance and the evolution of stablecoins. By bringing Ethena’s synthetic dollar to its massive user base, Binance is empowering traders with access to an innovative asset that challenges traditional paradigms. As the crypto market continues to mature, assets like USDe will play an increasingly vital role in shaping its future. This development is certainly one to watch closely. Frequently Asked Questions about USDe on Binance Here are some common questions regarding the new USDe listing on Binance: What is USDe?

Ledger chief technology officer Charles Guillemet issued an urgent warning on Monday, urging users to pause onchain transactions. He said a malicious payload had been planted in JavaScript packages downloaded more than one billion times, a scale that could threaten the entire ecosystem. There’s a large-scale supply chain attack in progress: the NPM account of a reputable developer has been compromised.

The affected packages have already been downloaded over 1 billion times, meaning the entire JavaScript ecosystem may be at risk,” Guillemet posted on X. He added that the malware silently swaps crypto addresses on the fly to steal funds. Developer Duped By Fake Lockout Alerts, Credentials Stolen In NPM Hack The attack stemmed from the compromise of the NPM account of Josh Junon, known in the open-source community as “qix.” Hackers sent phishing emails that mimicked the official npmjs.com domain, warning of an imminent account lockout.

Junon later confirmed on GitHub and Bluesky that he had been duped. “Sorry everyone, I should have paid more attention,” he wrote, adding that it had been a stressful week and promising to help clean up the incident. Some industry voices have suggested it could be the largest supply chain attack ever recorded. Important Notice @OKX is not affected by the NPM supply-chain incident.

It specifically threatens software wallets, decentralized applications and web-based interfaces that integrate the compromised packages. By silently substituting recipient addresses, attackers can redirect funds without the user noticing until it is too late. Companies moved quickly to reassure customers. Uniswap, Morpho, MetaMask, OKX Wallet, Sui and Aave all said they had not been affected by the breach. Since the malicious code was live for about two hours before NPM security teams intervened, some applications likely integrated the compromised versions during that window. However, blockchain monitors said the attacker has not yet received stolen funds. Junon also acknowledged inadvertently authorizing a reset of the two-factor authentication on his account, giving intruders further control. That lapse, combined with the phishing scheme, opened the door to the attack. While cleanup efforts are under way, the breach has raised new questions about the resilience of open-source infrastructure underpinning much of the crypto economy. The event also shows how a single compromised developer account can ripple across a global ecosystem.

Key Takeaways: Eightco shares surged over 3,000% after announcing a $250 million plan to adopt Worldcoin as its primary treasury asset. The company will rebrand its ticker to “ORBS”, aligning with Worldcoin’s iris-scanning Orb devices. Eightco joins a wave of firms entering crypto treasuries, following the path of MicroStrategy and BitMine. The little-known e-commerce inventory platform revealed plans to raise $250 million through a private placement of 171.23 million common shares at $1.46 each, aiming to build a substantial position in the Sam Altman-backed crypto project. The offering is expected to close on Thursday, with strategic participants including the World Foundation, Kraken, and FalconX. Eightco Shares Explode 3,000% in a Day, Then Dip After Hours Eightco shares skyrocketed from $1.45 on Friday to $45.08 at Monday’s close , a gain of 3,009%, after briefly hitting an intraday high above $80. After-hours trading saw the stock cool slightly, dropping nearly 6% to $42.40. The company said it may also accumulate Ethereum (ETH) as a secondary asset, but its primary focus will be on Worldcoin, the controversial iris-scan-based cryptocurrency project run by World Network, formerly known as Tools for Humanity. Eightco also announced plans to rebrand its ticker to “ORBS” to reflect its alignment with Worldcoin’s eye-scanning Orb devices, which are used to issue World IDs as proof of personhood in an increasingly AI-driven internet. Worldcoin, co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, aims to verify human identity online using biometric data. In return, users receive WLD tokens and access to a growing ecosystem of services.

This stock pumped 5000% today, what memecoins. pic.twitter.com/6bZ2AszQu5 — Panzuki.eth (@PandaAsiaStreet) September 8, 2025 While the project has gained traction, it’s also faced heavy scrutiny from regulators and privacy watchdogs, resulting in restrictions and bans in multiple countries. “If we succeed on our mission, World might become the largest network of real people online,” Altman said in a statement. Eightco’s move places it in the growing club of public companies diversifying into crypto treasuries, following the playbook popularized by firms like MicroStrategy and BitMine Immersion Technologies, the latter of which invested $20 million into Eightco as part of its broader crypto strategy. Dan Ives Named Chairman of Eightco Amid Worldcoin Pivot As part of the announcement, Dan Ives, Wedbush Securities’ head of tech research, was named chairman of Eightco’s board . Known for his bullish views on AI and disruptive technologies, Ives called the move “the next step in the AI revolution around authentication and Proof of Human.” Meanwhile, Worldcoin has surged 49.2% in the past 24 hours, trading at $1.54, with a seven-day gain of over 80%. Despite the rally, the token remains down nearly 87% from its all-time high of $11.74 in March 2024. As reported, Worldcoin’s digital identity system, World ID, has surpassed 100 million uses across third-party apps, marking a major milestone for Sam Altman’s identity-focused crypto initiative. However, mounting regulatory pressure and uncertainty continue to weigh on the project, prompting a rebrand to World Network and the rollout of new identity tools like NFC passport verification, aimed at privacy-friendly onboarding. France , Portugal , Spain , Hong Kong , and South Korea have all launched investigations into the project’s data practices.

Mutuum Finance presale is already at Stage 6 at $0.035. The project has already raised more than $15.5 million and boasts more than 16,150 token holders. As its raise become larger and its holder base bigger, everybody is wondering whether this new token of DeFi will take a similar viral path like Dogecoin (DOGE), which also became a force in the market after being elevated from a meme to a phenomenon. With investors looking at possible exponential return and analysts arguing whether it will be sustainable in the long run, the latest momentum of MUTM has positioned itself squarely at the centre of the crypto space and will definitely track DOGE’s 100x. Mutuum Finance Risk Management and Protocol Safety All assets underlying have parameters that reflect risk profile, including overcollateralization, borrowing and deposit thresholds, and collateral thresholds. Liquidators are incentivized to close undercollateralized trades. Higher Collateral Efficiency supports higher borrowing amounts for correlated securities, with Loan-to-Value ratios capping borrowing against collateral. Liquidation thresholds and penalties protect the protocol and incentivize timely intervention. Reserve factors divert some attention to serve as a default and extreme market incident buffer and riskier securities get more reserves. Stage 6 Presale supported by Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is already integrated in the DeFi ecosystem and possesses more than 16,150 investors and more than $15.5 million in presale at present. The project is also hosting a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program for security improvement on the platform and encouraging more community involvement, which has rewards offered for four danger levels, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low. Interest Rate Models When there is ample cash, prices remain at a low rate in MUTM; when there is insufficient money prices are increased, attempting to make lending costly; or simply, to obtain the borrowers to pay, or increase the deposits of money in the banks. Mutuum Finance Increases Security Mutuum Finance is placing tight constraints on all assets it’s lending out so that it has a high-risk profile, i.e., supply, borrowing limit and even collateral limit. The protocol can better handle market volatility by overcollateralizing positions and stabilizing undercollateralized positions by incentivized liquidators. The borrowing and lending limits will limit exposure to risky or illiquid assets and, in return, limit insolvency risks. Correlated assets are enhanced by more collateral efficiency and risky tokens have fewer collaterals available for issuance. Mutuum Finance Provides a Giveaway Fun Ten fortunate investors will be going home with $10k in a $100,000 giveaway . This celebrates current investors and incentivizes prospective investors to the platform. Market Volatility and Asset Liquidity There must be sufficient on-chain liquidity such that stressed positions close with minimal slippage. Liquidation caps and parameters modulate exposure, offering greater incentives to liquidators when there is lower liquidity. Asset volatility governs Loan-to-Value ratios and liquidation levels: assets with lower volatility may collateralize more LTVs and higher levels, and volatile assets more conservative ones. Risk ratings also dictate reserve factors, security protocol safety for mass participation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is on the rise, compared to Dogecoin’s first wave. Stage 6 presale tokens are at $0.035, with an increased total of over $15.5M raised and 16,150+ holders already committed, pointing to heavy market demand. Having a $50K bug bounty, a $100K giveaway, and robust risk management like overcollateralization and dynamic Loan-to-Value caps, MUTM balances security and growth potential. Gurus see exponential gains if its viral wave goes on. Buy and HODL your Stage 6 tokens now before the price increases to $0.04 next stage.

Related Reading: Fair Value Gap Suggests Bitcoin Price Is Going Higher, But Watch Out For This Crash So far, the Ethereum price has been consolidating between $4,200 and $4,300 after having faced resistance from $4,600-$4,800 in the last month. This has now led to what is the defining factor for the next phase of the move, and whether an uptrend or a downtrend will dominate. Assessing the current momentum, the crypto analyst notes that the recent uptrend was being supported by the bullish trendline starting from the August lows. However, there is still the matter of the bearish trendline that continues to limit the upward momentum, thereby putting a damper on the rally. At this point, it is now simply a matter of what level the Ethereum price retests, and what it successfully breaks through. From here, holding the demand above $4,300 is important if the bulls want to continue the rally. If they are successful, then the analyst does see the Ethereum price making its way back to $4,600-$4,800.

This would happen if bulls were unable to sustain the current demand, leading to a breakdown in the price. From here, the next major level would be the support at $4,000, pushing the Ethereum price toward the next major psychological level. What this trend shows is that while the market is leaning bullish, the bulls still have a relatively weak hold, meaning it could go sideways at any point. “The structure suggests a potential bullish reversal, but confirmation is required with a break of the bearish trendline and demand reaction,” the crypto analyst said.

In the clip, Kobyakov outlined concerns about the U.S. approach to gold and cryptocurrency markets, tying it directly to America’s mounting $35 trillion debt. Aljarrah warned that the approach outlined in the video could create significant risks for global finance. He argued that stablecoins are not the answer and pointed instead to XRP, highlighting its potential to serve as a neutral bridge asset in the international monetary system. Russia warns the US is using stablecoins backed by Treasuries to offload $35T debt. The play: push global adoption, then devalue the dollar, leaving the world holding the bag. Stablecoins aren’t the solution. The real answer is a neutral reserve bridge asset, and that’s #XRP . pic.twitter.com/sCOCrKoMWg — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) September 8, 2025 U.S. Debt and Stablecoin Strategy Kobyakov argued that Washington is attempting to “rewrite the rules of the gold and cryptocurrency markets” to address what he called “declining trust in the dollar.” He suggested the U.S. could shift part of its $35 trillion debt into stablecoins backed by treasuries, allowing the real value of those obligations to shrink over time. Referring to the 1930s and 1970s, he said America has used similar strategies before to manage imbalances at the expense of others. This time, however, he pointed to the digital asset market, with stablecoins emerging as a potential policy tool. The Global Implications Aljarrah summarized the video, writing that Russia is warning of a U.S. plan to use stablecoins to offload its national debt . He described the possible sequence as pushing for global adoption, then devaluing the dollar and leaving other countries exposed. His conclusion was clear: stablecoins cannot be relied on as a foundation for the international financial system. This line of argument reflects a broader concern that stablecoins, while appearing to provide stability, are ultimately tied to the same debt and fiscal policies that undermine confidence in the dollar itself. If Washington pursues this strategy, it could reinforce reliance on U.S. assets at first, but eventually weaken international trust once devaluation occurs. XRP as a Neutral Bridge Aljarrah went further by positioning XRP as the alternative. Many experts see XRP as the solution to the global financial crisis , and Aljarrah wrote that the “real answer is a neutral reserve bridge asset.” The idea is that XRP, unlike dollar-backed stablecoins, is not tied to a single nation’s fiscal policies and could serve as a neutral settlement medium in cross-border finance.

If major economies grow wary of dollar-denominated instruments, they may seek a neutral asset that avoids exposure to U.S. debt. XRP’s design for fast, low-cost international payments makes it a candidate for such a role. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This transition is happening as BTC trades near a long-term support zone, raising questions about whether its next move could be another leg higher or the start of a deeper correction. Whales Retreat, Mid-Sized Players Step Forward According to the data shared by analyst JA Maartunn, addresses with more than 1,000 BTC are getting smaller, while wallets with between 100 and 1,000 BTC are steadily getting bigger. “Big Fish Down, Medium Players Up,” stated the market watcher on X, pointing to a supply redistribution from whales to smaller ETF custody accounts. This suggests institutional flows are gradually fragmenting among mid-sized entities rather than remaining concentrated with the largest holders. At the same time, other traders are warning that Bitcoin has been in a “distribution phase” for more than two months. According to pseudonymous analyst Doctor Profit, heavy selling between $115,000 and $125,000 has consistently capped upward momentum, with whales and recently unlocked wallets offloading into rallies. His cautious tone was reinforced by technical signals from a recent report by CryptoQuant expert CryptoOnchain, who highlighted BTC’s test of a major ascending trendline that coincided with the realized price of new whales. He suggested that if the price goes below this zone, it could break the bullish structure and start a long-term drop. Despite the selling pressure from whales, not all analysts believe the bull run is finished. A previous analysis argues that cycle peaks are typically accompanied by retail euphoria and overheated on-chain metrics, conditions that are not present today. Additionally, indicators like a low Reserve Risk score suggest long-term holders remain confident, and expanding global liquidity could provide further tailwinds for appreciation . Prices Hold, But Momentum Looks Fragile According to CoinGecko data, Bitcoin is now worth $111,902, a modest 0.8% uptick from 24 hours ago. The world’s number one cryptocurrency has been between $110,909 and $112,806 in the last day, which is not as steep compared to the previous week, when it dropped as low as $108,799. On a seven-day basis, BTC has gained 1.4%, while its two-week performance is slightly firmer at 1.8%. However, the bigger picture shows a 5.6% drop over the past month, a sign of cooling momentum after hitting its all-time high of $124,457 less than a month ago on August 14. Year-on-year, the asset remains impressive with a 102.9% gain, even though its inability to retake the $115,000 to $125,000 band reflects the weight of ongoing profit-taking.

The mere thought of warehouses filled with this equipment often scares off potential investors. However, thanks to cloud mining platforms like SNEYD Miner , the process of acquiring cryptocurrency has become simpler than ever. There’s no hardware, no maintenance, and no hassle involved; simply sign up, sign a contract, and watch your balance grow. Traditional mining problems Bitcoin mining used to be very simple, and anyone could do it with a home computer. That was the case for a while. Now, individual miners need to build an ASIC or GPU mining rig, which is quite expensive in itself, not to mention the power consumption, cooling, and maintenance costs. For these reasons, mining is not attractive to most newcomers. However, cloud mining is the answer at this stage. How Cloud Mining Makes Cryptocurrency Accessible to Everyone With cloud mining, you can effectively leverage the computing power of a company that owns and operates a mining farm. Instead of shouldering the entire mining cost yourself, you simply sign a contract and pay the company to mine on your behalf, with the profits transferred directly to your account. Essentially, SNEYD Miner achieves completeness through a redesigned model. The platform addresses the most challenging issues, such as hardware, maintenance, and energy costs, while giving users the freedom to manage their own funds.

Global Reach: As there are more than 75 data centers running on renewable energy for the purpose of cryptocurrency mining, the platform is always online and always makes a profit.

Clients’ personal data and funds are highly secure using best-in-class encryption technology. Additionally, the platform provides real-time mining statistics so that you can effortlessly check the complete source of your income. Why start now?

The sooner you start mining, the more you can earn before competition intensifies and profits become negligible. Traditional mining can take months to become profitable, but with SNYED Miner’s cloud mining, miners can start making a profit immediately. Conclusion SNEYD Miner has cheap contracts, off ordinary rates, daily payouts, and an easy interface only for beginners, has not left the door to get into the cryptocurrency market but instead helped you to get passive income on the very first day.

The departments estimated that close to $10 billion is lost through such scams, and they are often run by trafficked labor. The U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) revealed that nine of the sanctioned targets are in Shwe Kokko town in Myanmar, which has become the center of online scams, and ten additional sites target entities linked to scams in Cambodia. Treasury targets Cambodian scam hubs John K Hurley, Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, said that the designations show the dual threat posed by the networks. He added that Southeast Asia’s cyber crimes threaten the well-being and financial security of Americans, alongside thousands of subjects to modern slavery. He noted that the losses have increased by 66% compared to the previous year, now closing to $10 billion. Today, Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control implemented sanctions against networks of scam centers across Southeast Asia that steal billions of dollars from Americans using forced labor and violence. The action includes nine targets operating in Burma, a notorious hub for… — Treasury Department (@USTreasury) September 8, 2025 Marco Rubio, U.S. Secretary of State, said the measure aims to protect Americans from industrial-scale fraud, forced labor, and physical and sexual abuse. He acknowledged that Southeast Asia’s Criminal actors have increasingly targeted and exploited U.S. citizens and other foreign victims through cyber fraud. The sanctions targeted individuals linked to the Karen National Army (KNA), an ethnic militia group that collaborated with the Burmese military. The U.S. cited that the KNA has benefited from scam compounds in Shwe Kokko, sanctioning its leader, Saw Chit Thu, alongside his deputies, Tin Win and Saw Min Min Oo. Companies like KNA include Chit Linn Myaing Company, Chit Linn Myaing Toyota Company, Chit Linn Myaing Mining and Industry Company, and Shwe Myint Thaung Yinn Industry & Manufacturing Company. The Treasury also sanctioned She Zhijiang, a Chinese businessman, and his company, Yatai International Holdings Group, and Myanmar Yatai International Holding Group. ZHijiang and KNA leaders are accused of developing the Yatai New City compound in Shwe Kokk, which is linked to hosting gambling, drug trafficking, prostitution, and scam operations. Some victims reported being lured into it with false job offers, detained, and forced to run online scams; some were also forced to undergo beatings and sexual assaults. OFAC sanctions 10 Cambodian entities for online scam and human trafficking In Cambodia, the sanctions targeted four individuals and six entities accused of operating scam compounds disguised as casinos, hotels, and office complexes, especially in Sihanoukville and Bavet. The indicted included Dong Lecheng, Xu Aimin, Chen AI Len, and Su Liansheng. The business entities linked to the individuals include TC Capital, KB Hotel, KBX Investment, Heng He Bavet, MDS Heng He, and HH Bank. OFAC revealed that Chinese investors initially built most facilities as Casinos, but later became hubs for cryptocurrency investment scams often done by trafficked victims. V ictims at the Sihanoukville and Sun Sky Casino were beaten and forced to conduct online scams and launder through the casinos. In Bavet, Chen AI Len and Su Liangsheng were linked to the Heng He Casino and other properties used for similar schemes. The latest sanction follows the May action against cyber scams in the region targeting the Karen National Army as a transnational criminal organization, along with its leaders and family members. Cryptopolitan reported that the sanctions were issued under Executive Orders 13581 and 14014. They block all U.S.-linked assets of the KNA and its leaders and prohibit all Americans from conducting business-related transactions. Huione Group was identified as the financial platform laundering the scam proceeds. As a result, all properties and interests tied to persons that fall under U.S. jurisdiction are blocked. The Treasury Department stated that the sanctions were issued under multiple authorities with executive orders targeting transnational criminal organizations, malicious cyber-enabled activities, human rights abuse, and those threatening stability in Myanmar.

Institutions hedge spot exposure with options, signaling capital inflows rather than retail panic. Technical breakout and bullish RSI divergence show resistance weakening and support strengthening for BTC. Long-Term Holders Remain Steady Bitcoin holders with coins aged between 5 and 7 years are now entering a new category. Data shows that the Realized Cap of this group has dropped from around $14.9 billion to $8.5 billion in the past year. According to analyst Cas Abbé, this decline is not due to selling. Instead, most of these coins have simply moved into the 7+ year age band. That means they have stayed in the same wallets, untouched, since being purchased between 2017 and 2019. “These aren’t weak hands,” Abbé said. “They’ve survived halvings, crashes, FUD waves, and blow-off tops.” Notably, this shift shows that long-term investors continue to hold their positions through changing market conditions. Unlike many assets, Bitcoin is not cycling through new owners as often. The same wallets continue to accumulate and hold. $BTC holders are quietly proving why they’re the backbone of every cycle. Over the past year, the 5–7 year cohort’s Realized Cap dropped from ~$14.9B → ~$8.5B. But here’s the catch, this isn’t because they sold. Almost all of it simply aged into the 7y+ bands. That means… pic.twitter.com/Q4mBJuz0Jn — Cas Abbé (@cas_abbe) September 9, 2025 Options Market Shows Institutional Movement Activity in the Bitcoin options market is also drawing attention. Analyst BitBull noted that the 1-month 25 Delta Skew has reached a new high. This metric often reflects a rise in demand for downside protection. “Everyone’s staring at price, but the real action is in the options market,” BitBull posted. “This isn’t retail panic, it’s institutions hedging.” As ETFs and other investment products become more common , large players are entering the space. Many of these firms hedge their spot positions with puts. The increase in skew shows this hedging in progress. Source: BitBull/X While this might appear to signal fear, it reflects risk management. Institutions are building exposure while protecting it against short-term drops. Price Action Signals Support is Building Bitcoin recently broke out of a multi-week downtrend, which has been confirmed with multiple daily closes above it. After the breakout, the price tested resistance around $113,500, a level that previously acted as support in August. The rejection from that level was shallow. The asset fell briefly, then quickly returned to retest the same area. Analyst Rekt Capital observed , “This resistance may be weakening as a point of rejection.” Source: Rekt Capital/X Bitcoin is now trading near $113,000. If it closes above $113,500, further upside may follow. If not, a move back to $110,000 seems likely. Another observation came from Merlijn The Trader, who pointed to a divergence between price and RSI on the weekly chart. While the price made lower lows, RSI posted higher lows. “Price makes lower lows. RSI makes higher lows,” he said. “This is a textbook bear trap.” This pattern is being watched closely by traders looking for signs of trend change.

Analysts Comment,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/what-is-the-short-term-outlook-for-bitcoin-is-a-decline-coming-analysts-comment/,"Cryptocurrency analysis platform Greeks.live has shared a cautious assessment of Bitcoin's short-term outlook. Many investors believe Bitcoin could break the $110,000 support level again, a scenario that could also lead to additional weakness in Ethereum (ETH), according to a briefing prepared for the Chinese community by Adam, the firm's macroeconomics researcher. The market outlook is marked by a negative CB premium and Ethereum's failure to break above $5,000, prompting investors to adopt a cautious approach.

The statement noted that liquidity was generally weak in September, noting that the current correction has persisted for more than half a month and shows no signs of ending. Despite this, it argued that short-term options offer a relatively low-cost “buy the dip” opportunity, offering limited downside risk and unlimited upside potential, making them well-suited for directional buying in current market conditions. *This is not investment advice.

Ripple, a leading enterprise blockchain and crypto solutions provider, has officially announced a pivotal partnership. They will be providing their robust Ripple crypto custody services to BBVA, a major Spanish banking group. This collaboration marks a crucial step forward for institutional engagement with digital assets, ensuring secure and compliant storage solutions. Why is BBVA Embracing Ripple Crypto Custody? This isn’t BBVA’s first foray into the digital asset space. The bank previously launched Bitcoin and Ethereum custody services for its retail investors in July. This latest move with Ripple demonstrates a clear strategic expansion into institutional-grade solutions. By leveraging Ripple’s specialized technology, BBVA aims to securely manage and store tokenized assets, including a broader range of cryptocurrencies, for its institutional clients. The decision by a bank of BBVA’s stature to deepen its commitment to digital assets signals a growing trend. Financial institutions are increasingly recognizing the immense potential of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. However, security and regulatory compliance remain paramount concerns for these established players. Understanding Ripple’s Secure Crypto Custody Solution What exactly does Ripple crypto custody entail? It refers to the specialized technology and services Ripple offers to financial institutions for the secure storage and management of digital assets. These solutions are meticulously designed to meet the stringent security and compliance requirements of traditional banking environments. Key aspects of Ripple’s custody technology often include: Advanced Security Protocols: Utilizing multi-signature authentication and robust encryption to protect assets from unauthorized access. Regulatory Compliance: Built to adhere to global financial regulations, making it easier for banks to integrate crypto services legally and responsibly. Scalability: Designed to handle a growing volume of digital assets and transactions as institutional adoption increases. Operational Efficiency: Streamlining the process of managing digital assets, from secure storage to seamless transfer and reporting. This comprehensive technology provides the necessary infrastructure for banks like BBVA to confidently offer crypto-related services to their high-net-worth and corporate clients. The Broader Impact of Institutional Crypto Adoption The partnership between Ripple and BBVA goes beyond just one bank or one service. It highlights a significant shift in the financial landscape. When major banks offer Ripple crypto custody or similar services, it lends considerable credibility and legitimacy to the digital asset market. This institutional embrace has several key implications: Increased Trust: Traditional investors and corporations may feel more comfortable entering the crypto space when trusted financial institutions provide secure and regulated services. Market Maturation: The involvement of regulated entities helps mature the market, potentially reducing volatility and increasing stability by attracting more stable capital. Regulatory Clarity: As more institutions engage, there’s a greater push for clearer and more comprehensive regulatory frameworks, which benefits the entire industry. New Financial Products: It paves the way for innovative financial products and services built on digital assets, from tokenized securities to new investment vehicles. These developments are crucial for moving cryptocurrencies from a niche interest to a mainstream, globally integrated financial instrument. What Does This Mean for the Future of Finance? This collaboration is a powerful indicator of the evolving relationship between traditional finance and the crypto world. It suggests a future where digital assets are seamlessly integrated into existing banking structures, rather than operating in parallel. The secure storage solutions provided by Ripple are foundational to this transformation. The provision of secure Ripple crypto custody by a bank like BBVA could: Accelerate the tokenization of real-world assets, making them more liquid and accessible to a broader investor base. Foster greater interoperability between different blockchain networks and traditional financial systems, creating a more unified financial ecosystem. Position Ripple as a key infrastructure provider for the institutional crypto market, strengthening its role in global finance. Ultimately, such partnerships are laying the groundwork for a more efficient, transparent, and digitally-driven global financial system. This forward-thinking approach is setting new standards for how digital assets are managed and utilized by established financial institutions. The announcement that Ripple will provide Ripple crypto custody services to BBVA is a landmark event. It underscores the growing demand for institutional-grade digital asset solutions and highlights Ripple’s strategic position in meeting these needs. As more traditional banks follow BBVA’s lead, we can expect a continued acceleration of cryptocurrency adoption and integration into the global financial ecosystem. This partnership is not just about technology; it’s about building trust and paving the way for the next era of finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are crypto custody services?

Check Out Ruvi AI (RUVI), Only $2000 Needed as Its Presale Reach Record Speed Post Phase 2’s End",https://timestabloid.com/a-faster-path-to-6-figures-than-tron-trx-check-out-ruvi-ai-ruvi/,"For investors who watched Tron (TRX) deliver life-changing returns, the hunt for the next crypto with similar potential is relentless. While Tron’s days of exponential growth are in the past, a new project, Ruvi AI (RUVI), is emerging as a potential faster path to six-figure gains. Following the record-speed conclusion of its second presale phase, experts are highlighting how a modest $2,000 investment in Ruvi AI could generate returns that far outpace established coins. The project’s presale has been a whirlwind of success, raising an astonishing $3.5 million and selling over 260 million tokens . This has drawn in a powerful and fast-growing community of over 3,400 investors , proving the market is aggressively seeking projects with tangible utility and a clear trajectory for massive growth. The Mathematical Edge Over Tron Why is Ruvi AI being hailed as a faster path to wealth than established players like Tron? It comes down to market dynamics. Tron’s large market capitalization means it requires an immense influx of capital for even modest gains. Ruvi AI, on the other hand, is a ground-floor opportunity. Its low entry price and high growth potential create the perfect storm for exponential ROI, making the path from a $2,000 investment to six figures a realistic possibility. This potential is anchored by a solid foundation of trust. Ruvi AI has successfully undergone a comprehensive smart contract audit with CyberScope , a respected third-party security firm, assuring investors of the platform’s integrity. This credibility, combined with a high-profile listing on CoinMarketCap , has validated Ruvi AI as a serious contender, attracting both smart retail and institutional money. A Super App Revolutionizing the $104B Creator Economy The engine behind Ruvi AI’s explosive potential is its revolutionary super app, an all-in-one ecosystem designed to empower content creators in the booming $104 billion creator economy . By solving critical pain points for a massive user base, Ruvi AI is creating intrinsic demand for its token. The app’s integrated AI-powered tools include: Advanced Trend Research: Helps creators identify viral topics before they hit the mainstream, giving them a powerful competitive advantage. AI-Powered Script Generation: Creates engaging, platform-optimized scripts for YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram, saving valuable time and enhancing content quality. Native Media Creation: Allows users to generate professional-quality images and videos directly within the app, reducing production costs. Streamlined Workflows: Centralizes the entire content creation process, from planning and editing to scheduling, to maximize productivity. This focus on real-world utility provides a sustainable foundation for the token’s value to grow exponentially, making it a far more calculated bet than purely speculative assets. The Countdown to a 40% Price Surge Is On Following the record-breaking conclusion of Phase 2, the presale has now entered Phase 3 , with the RUVI token available at the highly attractive price of $0.020 . However, this window of opportunity is closing fast. According to the project’s tokenomics, the start of Phase 4 will trigger an automatic 40% price increase to $0.028 . This guaranteed and imminent price surge is creating intense FOMO, fueling the record-speed sales as investors rush to lock in an immediate paper gain. Strategic Partnership and High-Reward VIP Tiers Ruvi AI’s journey toward six-figure returns is further amplified by a strategic partnership with WEEX , a major cryptocurrency exchange. This collaboration will ensure deep liquidity and a seamless trading experience upon launch, paving the way for rapid price discovery and broader market adoption. For investors looking to maximize their potential returns, the project’s VIP program offers a clear mathematical path to significant wealth: VIP 5 ($10,000 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 9,900% ROI . VIP 3 ($2,000 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 7,900% ROI . VIP 2 ($1,000 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 6,900% ROI . A competitive leaderboard giveaway also rewards top supporters, fostering a vibrant and engaged community that adds to the project’s unstoppable momentum.

His remarks show how policymakers debate the central bank’s policy as Japan faces uncertainty in leadership and economic plans. Kono spoke in an interview and said that weak monetary policy causes Japan’s inflation problems. He warned that if the BOJ keeps delaying a rate hike, import prices will remain high and households will continue to face rising costs. The yen traded at about 147.35 to the dollar on Tuesday morning, which is weak compared to its five-year average of 133.61. Kono rejects cash handouts and urges BOJ to act on weak yen Kono was opposed to the idea of providing cash handouts to citizens as a means of gaining favor and political support. He stated that such methods may appear helpful, but disrupt Japan’s fiscal deficit. They also do not solve the country’s biggest problem, which he says the Bank of Japan is responsible for. Since the BOJ has insisted on keeping interest rates low, the yen has grown weaker year after year, making imported goods even more expensive. Japan depends on imports for energy, food, and many raw materials, and the weak yen has increased the prices of goods and reduced the spending power of households across the country. Kono stated that the only solution is for the BOJ to immediately raise interest rates to strengthen the yen, slow inflation, and give citizens some financial relief from the high cost of living. Kono also stated that government spending programs or cash handouts are not permanent solutions because they do not solve the biggest issue of low interest rates, which is responsible for Japan’s inflation problem. His comments demonstrate just how divided the Liberal Democratic Party is. Some of its leaders still support loose monetary policies and aggressive government spending, hoping it would stimulate growth. On the other hand, their counterparts say policymakers need a more disciplined approach that puts currency stability and long-term financial health above anything else. Kono pressures BOJ amid leadership turmoil Kono’s warning to the BOJ came just a few days after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced his resignation from office. The prime minister’s decision shocked the nation and created doubt about Japan’s political and economic direction, as the country is struggling with rising inflation. Ishida’s exit stirred up conflict and competition within the Liberal Democratic Party because the next prime minister will also greatly influence how the government responds to economic challenges. The main candidates have different views about how to deal with the failing economy. Sanae Takaichi, a leading contender, stated that the BOJ should continue with its loose monetary policies, showing her support for using government spending to boost growth. The problem with her approach is that it will likely increase Japan’s already massive public debt, and many economists warn that this could worsen the current economic conditions. The Bank of Japan is preparing for its next policy meeting on September 19, even as the political debate grows louder by the day. Most financial analysts say the central bank will likely maintain its current policies despite the growing criticism. Such expectations prove just how cautious the BOJ is when it comes to economic policies, and it also shows how detached it is from the views of lawmakers like Kono.

Nasdaq’s Vision For Transforming Traditional Financial Services In a recent LinkedIn post, Nasdaq President Tal Cohen emphasized the potential of integrating tokenization and blockchain technology with traditional market infrastructure. He pointed out that this fusion could provide substantial advantages to issuers, investors, and the broader economy by reducing friction in transactions, speeding up settlement times, automating processes, and enhancing capital and collateral management efficiencies. As part of this effort, Nasdaq has submitted a filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to enable the trading of tokenized securities on its platform. In his remarks, Cohen acknowledged the potential of blockchain technology to introduce new post-trade processes, modernize proxy voting, and create programmable methods for managing corporate actions. The rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) has offered valuable insights into how core financial services—such as lending, trading, and clearing—can operate differently to deliver value. However, Cohen also highlighted the risks associated with rapid advancements. Cohen stressed the importance of embedding governance and investor protection from the outset to ensure that the benefits of innovation can be fully realized. First Token-Settled Trades By Late 2026? Nasdaq’s recent filing is seen as a pivotal step in its journey to incorporate digital asset technology into the US equities markets responsibly. The proposal aims to integrate new capabilities into the existing financial system, further enhancing the efficiency and trustworthiness of these markets. If the SEC approves Nasdaq’s proposal, it would represent the first instance of tokenized securities being traded on a major US stock exchange, marking a significant milestone in the integration of blockchain-based settlement into the national market system. Notably, Coinbase, the largest US cryptocurrency exchange , has also sought the regulatory agency’s approval for offering “tokenized equities” to its users, while major banks like Bank of America and Citi have expressed interest in exploring tokenized assets. Once Nasdaq’s proposal is in place and the necessary infrastructure from the central clearing agency is operational, investors could potentially buy shares on Nasdaq that settle in token form, all without altering the current processes for order routing, pricing, surveillance, or reporting. Nasdaq anticipates that US investors may witness the first token-settled trades by the end of the third quarter of 2026, contingent upon the readiness of the Depository Trust Company’s infrastructure.

Ledger Issues Urgent Warning On Monday, Ledger CTO Guillemet posted on X that the npm account of a reputable open-source maintainer had been compromised, leading to malicious updates across widely used software libraries. He wrote, “There’s a large-scale supply chain attack in progress… the entire JavaScript ecosystem may be at risk.” He stressed that hardware wallet users remain secure if they verify every transaction, but advised all others to stop conducting blockchain transactions temporarily. Malicious Updates to Widely Used Packages The breach occurred on September 8 when hackers gained access to the npm account of Josh Goldberg, known as “Qix.” Attackers published corrupted versions of 18 packages, including chalk, debug, strip-ansi, and color-convert, which collectively account for more than 2.6 billion weekly downloads and are embedded in core developer tools like Babel and ESLint. Researchers discovered that the injected code carried “crypto-clipper” malware designed to intercept browser functions. The payload swaps legitimate wallet addresses with attacker-controlled ones and, in some cases, hijacks wallet communications to modify transactions before signatures are applied. The malware was first detected after a build error revealed hidden obfuscated code. Sophisticated Attack Strategy Analysis showed the malware was engineered with dual tactics: passively replacing wallet addresses with lookalikes, while actively intercepting and altering transactions on browser-based wallets such as MetaMask. This layered approach allowed attackers to redirect funds seamlessly, often without users realizing. Investigations suggest the breach originated from a phishing attack on npm maintainers. Fraudulent emails, posing as official npm security notices, instructed recipients to update two-factor authentication or risk account suspension. Victims who followed the link were directed to a fake login page, allowing attackers to seize credentials and infiltrate Goldberg’s account. Once inside, the attackers distributed malicious versions of the core packages, effectively weaponizing software tools relied upon by millions. Security firm Aikido noted that the code functioned as a browser interceptor, capable of rewriting payment destinations, altering API calls, and tampering with website content. Ongoing Fallout and Industry Concerns Although npm has removed many of the compromised versions, security experts warn that hidden transitive dependencies make it difficult to fully contain the attack. Developers are being urged to audit projects, pin known-safe package versions, and rebuild lockfiles immediately. The incident underscores the fragility of the open-source ecosystem, which depends heavily on trust between maintainers and developers. With wallet addresses linked to stolen funds already surfacing on-chain, researchers are calling the attack one of the most severe in the history of the JavaScript ecosystem.

The partnership comes as BBVA recently launched a crypto-asset trading and custody service in Spain, which offers Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) to retail clients. Ripple’s Expansion Into Spain With this integration, BBVA will rely on Ripple Custody, an institutional-grade self-custody solution designed to securely manage tokenized assets, including cryptocurrencies. Ripple Custody allows financial institutions to scale their services and address growing client demand for exposure to digital assets while ensuring compliance with strict security, operational, and regulatory standards. The announcement further deepens the ties with BBVA, a relationship that already extends to BBVA Switzerland and Garanti BBVA in Turkey. By strengthening its custody infrastructure, BBVA said that it is positioning itself at the forefront of crypto adoption in Europe, providing retail investors. The announcement comes as banks in Europe prepare for Market in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulations. In a statement, Cassie Craddock, Managing Director, Europe, at Ripple, said “Now that the EU’s Market’s in Crypto-Assets regulation (MiCA) is established across Europe, the region’s banks are emboldened to launch the digital asset offerings that their customers are asking for. BBVA has long been one of the region’s most innovative banks and we’re proud to support its ambitions with the most secure and compliant digital asset technology on the market.” Meanwhile, BBVA’s Head of Digital Assets, Francisco Maroto, said that Ripple’s custody solution will help the bank to leverage “proven and trusted” technology and the “highest security and operational standards,” and enable it to directly provide an end-to-end custody service to its customers. XRP Eyes Next Move On the price side of things, Ripple’s token XRP is consolidating between $2.7 support and $3.4-$3.5 resistance, after a week of muted momentum and indecisive order flow. As the crypto asset eyes an uptick, a breakout above $3.1 could fuel upside toward resistance, while losing $2.7 risks a deeper retracement to $2.4. Until then, range-bound consolidation dominates XRP’s outlook.

According to a recent analysis by renowned crypto analyst Axel Adler Jr., the Bitcoin bull market has officially entered its late stages. This isn’t just a casual observation; it’s based on meticulous data, marking 504 days since Bitcoin’s last halving event. For many, this signals a crucial period for the world’s leading cryptocurrency, prompting questions about what comes next and when we might see the ultimate high. What Defines This Late-Stage Bitcoin Bull Market? Axel Adler Jr.’s analysis highlights several key indicators that point to this advanced phase of the Bitcoin bull market . One significant event was a substantial sell-off by long-term holders that occurred in March, as Bitcoin’s price hovered around the $70,000 mark. This movement is often a natural part of a maturing market cycle, as early investors begin to realize profits. However, what makes this cycle particularly interesting is the subsequent pattern of selling. Following the initial large sell-off, Adler noted more moderate selling activity at higher price points, specifically around $98,000 and $117,000. This distributed selling, rather than a single massive dump, suggests a different kind of market dynamic at play. Why Is This Bitcoin Bull Market Showing Sustainable Strength? The pattern of distributed selling is a critical piece of the puzzle. Unlike a sudden, overwhelming wave of selling that could destabilize the market, this gradual distribution indicates a robust underlying demand. Adler suggests that this strength is highly sustainable, primarily due to strong institutional demand actively absorbing the available supply. When large institutions enter the market, they often bring significant capital, providing a solid foundation that can withstand profit-taking by individual investors. This institutional interest is a game-changer. It means that even as long-term holders take profits, there’s a continuous influx of new capital ready to buy, preventing sharp, sustained downturns. Consequently, this creates a more stable and resilient upward trajectory for the Bitcoin bull market , setting it apart from previous cycles. When Can We Expect the Astounding Bitcoin Bull Market Peak? So, what does this mean for Bitcoin’s ultimate price peak? Adler’s projection is quite specific and exciting. He points out that the final peak of a typical Bitcoin bull market cycle often occurs when the spot price reaches approximately eleven times higher than the average cost basis of long-term holders. This historical metric provides a powerful framework for forecasting the market’s climax. Based on this calculation and the current market dynamics, Adler Jr. projects that the peak of the current Bitcoin bull market will arrive between October and November of this year. This forecast gives investors a potential timeframe to consider, allowing them to plan their strategies. It’s a crucial period that could see Bitcoin reaching unprecedented highs, rewarding those who have held strong through its journey. What Should Investors Consider During This Dynamic Phase? Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on market analyses and expert opinions to understand evolving trends. Understand Selling Patterns: Recognize that profit-taking by long-term holders is a natural part of a bull market. Monitor Institutional Flow: Observe indicators of institutional investment, as their demand is a key driver of sustainability. Prepare for Volatility: While a peak is projected, crypto markets can be volatile. Be ready for price swings. Review Your Strategy: Consider your personal investment goals and risk tolerance in light of these projections. The journey of the Bitcoin bull market is always full of twists and turns, but current analysis suggests we are heading towards an extraordinary climax. With institutional demand providing a strong backbone and historical patterns pointing to a clear timeframe, the next few months promise to be exceptionally interesting for Bitcoin enthusiasts and investors alike. The stage is set for what could be a truly remarkable conclusion to this cycle. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does ‘late-stage bull market’ mean for Bitcoin? A1: A late-stage bull market indicates that Bitcoin has experienced significant price appreciation, and while further gains are expected, it is approaching its cyclical peak, where a major correction or bear market might follow. Q2: Who is Axel Adler Jr., and what is his expertise? A2: Axel Adler Jr. is a recognized crypto analyst known for his data-driven insights into Bitcoin’s market cycles and price movements, often leveraging on-chain metrics and historical patterns. Q3: How does the Bitcoin halving event influence the bull market cycle? A3: Bitcoin halving events reduce the supply of new Bitcoin, historically acting as a catalyst for bull markets by creating scarcity and increasing demand over time, usually peaking 12-18 months after the event. Q4: Why is institutional demand crucial for the current Bitcoin bull market? A4: Institutional demand provides significant capital inflow, absorbing supply from profit-taking long-term holders. This robust buying pressure helps stabilize prices and sustains the upward momentum, preventing sharp downturns. Q5: What is the ‘eleven times higher’ rule mentioned by Adler? A5: This rule suggests that historically, the final peak of a Bitcoin bull market tends to occur when the spot price reaches approximately eleven times the average cost basis (the average price at which they acquired their coins) of long-term holders. Q6: What should investors consider if the peak is expected by October-November? A6: Investors should consider reviewing their investment strategies, setting profit targets, and preparing for potential increased volatility. It’s also a good time to reassess risk tolerance and diversify portfolios if needed. If you found this analysis insightful, don’t keep it to yourself!

Meme tokens have never been predictable, and their sharp swings continue to dominate headlines. With the market now looking for its next leader, a handful of projects are pushing beyond hype into structured momentum. In the past 24 hours, Official Trump climbed 1.15% to $8.54, extending its rally while Cheems slid 3.38% to $0.0001602. Both moves highlight the volatility of the meme coin sector, where investor conviction is tested daily. Meanwhile, BullZilla ($BZIL) presale has already raised over $254,000, attracted 911 holders, and sold more than 21.88 billion tokens. With ROI potential above 16,000%, it is shaping up as one of the most anticipated 100x meme coins of 2025. BullZilla ($BZIL): The Investor’s Dream in Early Stages BullZilla ’s presale isn’t built around static stages. Instead, its price automatically increases either every $100,000 raised or every 48 hours. This ensures that momentum continues to climb and rewards early conviction. At today’s presale price of $0.00003241, the eventual listing price of $0.00527 reflects a projected ROI of 16,164%. The data speaks clearly. With $254,000 raised, 911 wallets participating, and 21.88 billion tokens sold, BullZilla has already shown real traction. A $1,000 buy today secures 30.85 million tokens, while a $5,000 stake captures more than 154 million tokens. These allocations show how early buyers are positioning for exponential upside. Adding to the appeal is its referral system. Buyers receive 10% bonus tokens on purchases above $50 with a referral code, while sharers earn 10% rewards from their network. Rewards unlock after two weeks, aligning short-term bonuses with longer-term loyalty. Among 100x meme coins, few presales present such a balance of community growth and investor upside. BullZilla’s Tokenomics Breakdown BullZilla’s supply is engineered around scarcity and sustainability. Out of its nearly 160 billion tokens, half are allocated to presale, while 20% powers staking rewards through the HODL Furnace, delivering an eye-catching 70% APY. Another 20% is directed toward the Roarblood Vault for ecosystem development and referral payouts. The remaining 10% is split between team allocations and a dedicated burn pool. Each time Bull Zilla advances into a new lore chapter, tokens from the reserve are permanently destroyed. This deflationary mechanism ensures supply shrinks as demand grows, a formula that drives scarcity. The combination of live burns, high staking yields, and referral rewards makes BullZilla stand out in the crowded field of meme coins. Official Trump ($TRUMP): Political Branding Meets Market Resilience Official Trump rose 1.15% in the last 24 hours to $8.54, extending gains as political-themed tokens continue to attract buyers. Trading patterns reveal resistance forming near $8.60, with short-term support at $8.40. Analysts are watching whether momentum can carry it toward $9 in the near term. Technical indicators show modest strength. The RSI sits in the mid-50s, pointing to steady accumulation without overbought risk. The MACD line is edging closer to a bullish crossover, signaling potential continuation if volume increases. Market sentiment around regulatory clarity and upcoming political cycles adds further intrigue. However, while Official Trump has cultural reach and speculative appeal, its growth ceiling may be limited compared to emerging presales. Established price levels make 100x returns far harder to achieve, which is why projects like BullZilla capture investor attention when looking for asymmetrical gains. Cheems ($CHEEMS): A Setback in a Competitive Meme Landscape Cheems fell 3.38% in the last day to $0.0001602, reflecting the challenges of sustaining momentum in a market crowded with new entrants. Price charts show consolidation between $0.000155 and $0.000165, with resistance levels aligning near $0.00017. Traders are closely watching support at $0.00015. RSI readings hover near 45, suggesting bearish undertones, while MACD shows waning momentum. Trading volume has also declined, hinting at hesitation among buyers. Despite its long history in meme coin culture, Cheems faces pressure from tokens with more aggressive tokenomics and fresh narratives. Community strength remains Cheems’ main asset, but as ROI expectations shift toward presales, projects like BullZilla with progressive pricing and live burn mechanics stand out as stronger candidates for the next 100x meme coins. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, BullZilla is outperforming both Official Trump and Cheems in terms of ROI potential. While TRUMP gains ground with political branding and Cheems holds cultural relevance, neither provides the exponential upside that BullZilla’s presale mechanics currently offer. With $254,000 already raised, 21.88 billion tokens sold, and ROI projections above 16,000%, BullZilla’s presale is firmly positioned among the top 100x meme coins of 2025. Investors exploring the best crypto to buy today should consider BullZilla’s unique blend of staking rewards, deflationary design, and progressive price model. The next presale surge is imminent, and early participation offers the most straightforward path to maximum upside.

In a post on X, he drew attention to the asset’s recent climb toward $3, noting that a breakout with significant volume could help it conquer that resistance and turn it back to support. $XRP touched almost $3 again Now we need that breakout volume pic.twitter.com/o6m7HsKgKn — XRP_Cro AI / Gaming / DePIN (@stedas) September 8, 2025 XRP’s Recent Performance Toward the end of August, XRP faced a pronounced decline. By August 30, the token had dropped below the $3 support level after large whale sell-offs during the month. The selling pressure weighed heavily on XRP’s price, and by September 1, the asset had dropped to $2.72 , with many investors worried that the decline would continue. Despite this weakness, some large holders increased their XRP positions. Momentum began to shift in the subsequent days, and by September 5, XRP had stabilized around $2.75, showing positive signs of an impending recovery. On Sunday, September 7, XRP staged a sharp rally that carried it back toward $2.92. This marked a clear recovery from the previous lows and represented one of the strongest moves since the decline. The rebound coincided with renewed demand and greater buying activity, pushing the token back toward the $3 threshold. The rally was notable because it showed buyers regaining control after consolidation . Market participants are now watching to see whether the momentum can push XRP through the $3 resistance and higher levels that have repeatedly capped its progress. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Chart Analysis and the Descending Triangle Returning to XRPCro’s chart, one of the key elements visible is what appears to be part of a descending triangle formation . The pattern, characterized by lower highs converging toward a flat or slightly declining support line, often signals consolidation that precedes a decisive move. In this case, the chart shows XRP at $2.98, heading toward $3, and then the upper boundary of this formation. The resistance line, marked in yellow on the chart, demonstrates where sellers have previously controlled the market. Breaking above this line with conviction would require significant volume, as XRPCro emphasized. Without that confirmation, the digital asset risks retracing back toward the established support zone around $2.7, highlighted in green on the chart.

A substantial PROVE token transfer , valued at an impressive $2.86 million, recently occurred, moving from an address believed to be linked with the zero-knowledge (ZK) proof startup, Succinct, directly to a Bybit deposit address associated with BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes. This intriguing transaction, reported by on-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa, has sparked widespread speculation regarding its underlying purpose. What Sparked This Major PROVE Token Transfer? The core of the recent crypto discussion revolves around this significant PROVE token transfer . Approximately 3.21 million PROVE tokens changed hands, reaching Arthur Hayes’ known deposit address just hours ago. Succinct, the alleged sender, is a prominent player in the zero-knowledge proof space. ZK proofs are a cryptographic method allowing one party to prove to another that a statement is true, without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself. This technology is crucial for enhancing privacy and scalability in blockchain networks. Sender: An address linked to Succinct, a zero-knowledge proof startup. Recipient: Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, a highly influential figure in the crypto industry. Asset: 3.21 million PROVE tokens, valued at $2.86 million. Platform: The transfer was made to a Bybit deposit address. The exact reason for this substantial transfer remains unclear, fueling a variety of theories within the crypto community. Such large, high-profile transactions often signal strategic moves or significant partnerships. Who Are the Key Players in This PROVE Token Transfer? Understanding the entities involved is crucial to grasping the potential implications of this PROVE token transfer . Succinct is at the forefront of developing infrastructure for ZK proofs, aiming to make blockchain interactions more private and efficient. Their work is fundamental to the progression of Web3 technologies, offering solutions for secure and scalable decentralized applications. On the other side, Arthur Hayes is a well-known personality in the crypto space. As the co-founder of BitMEX, one of the earliest and largest cryptocurrency derivatives exchanges, he holds significant influence. Hayes is also recognized for his insightful market commentary and often provides strong opinions on crypto trends and developments. His involvement in any significant transaction naturally draws considerable attention and analysis. This confluence of a cutting-edge ZK proof project and a major industry figure suggests that the PROVE token transfer could be more than just a routine transaction. It could indicate a strategic investment, a partnership, or even a liquidity provision. What Could This PROVE Token Transfer Mean for the Market? The mystery surrounding the PROVE token transfer has opened up several avenues for speculation. Is it an investment by Arthur Hayes into Succinct’s ecosystem? Hayes is known for identifying promising projects early on. Alternatively, it could be a strategic allocation of tokens for a liquidity pool or a market-making operation, given his background in exchange operations. Furthermore, it might be related to an advisory role or a direct collaboration between Hayes and Succinct. Potential Implications: Increased Visibility: Hayes’ involvement could bring significant attention and credibility to Succinct and the PROVE token. Strategic Partnership: It might hint at a deeper collaboration that could benefit both parties. Market Confidence: A high-profile transfer could boost investor confidence in the PROVE token and the ZK proof sector. However, without official statements from either party, these remain educated guesses. The crypto market often thrives on such intriguing puzzles, and this particular PROVE token transfer is no exception. Looking Ahead: The Future of PROVE and ZK Proofs Regardless of the specific reason for this transaction, the substantial PROVE token transfer underscores the growing importance of zero-knowledge proof technology within the blockchain landscape. As privacy and scalability become increasingly critical for the mass adoption of decentralized applications, projects like Succinct are poised to play a pivotal role. Arthur Hayes’ potential involvement, whatever its nature, could accelerate this trajectory, bringing more mainstream attention and resources to the ZK proof sector. The crypto community will undoubtedly keep a close watch for any further details or announcements that might shed light on this intriguing development. Such events highlight the dynamic and often opaque nature of on-chain activity, where every major transaction can tell a story, even if initially veiled in mystery. FAQs about the PROVE Token Transfer Q1: What is a PROVE token? A PROVE token is the native cryptocurrency associated with the Succinct zero-knowledge (ZK) proof startup, likely used within its ecosystem for various functions such as governance, utility, or staking. Q2: Who is Arthur Hayes? Arthur Hayes is a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency industry, best known as the co-founder and former CEO of BitMEX, a leading cryptocurrency derivatives exchange. He is also a well-regarded market commentator. Q3: What are zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs?

51440259,https://invezz.com/?p=2867404,1757409915,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,US Congress wants Treasury to detail plan for Bitcoin reserve,https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/09/us-congress-wants-treasury-to-detail-plan-for-bitcoin-reserve/,"The United States Treasury Department may soon be directed to evaluate and report on the feasibility, custody, and legal framework for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and federal digital asset holdings, as mandated in a new bill presented to Congress last Friday. Introduced by Representative David P. Joyce, the House appropriations bill includes provisions that could accelerate the US government’s exploration of sovereign digital asset management. The bill, if passed, would specifically task the Treasury Department with producing a comprehensive report within 90 days of the bill’s enactment. This report would assess not only the technical and legal feasibility of creating a federal Bitcoin reserve but also outline interagency transfer mechanisms, custody models, and cybersecurity protocols required to manage such assets securely. Among other agendas, the bill also calls for clarity on how digital assets, whether Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, would be represented on the federal balance sheet. Lawmakers are also looking for more transparency around third-party contractors who might be engaged to safeguard the government’s holdings. Another key component of the bill is its focus on fiscal implications, with the bill asking the Treasury to weigh potential impacts on the Department of the Treasury Forfeiture Fund, which is traditionally used for managing assets seized in federal criminal investigations. The question here is whether re-routing some of these assets into a sovereign reserve could alter how those funds are typically allocated or replenished. Building on Trump’s Bitcoin reserve executive order The renewed momentum behind this legislative effort builds on a March 2025 executive order signed by President Donald Trump , which formally established the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a companion Digital Asset Stockpile. That order, announced during the White House Crypto Summit, marked a turning point in US crypto policy. According to the White House fact sheet, the reserve would be capitalised initially with Bitcoin seized in criminal and civil forfeiture proceedings, transforming assets once destined for liquidation into a long-term national store of value. At the time, David Sacks, appointed as Trump’s AI and crypto czar, described the reserve as “a digital Fort Knox,” as he stressed that the US government will not sell the Bitcoin placed into the reserve. Instead, it would be held as a strategic hedge against fiat instability, acting on the gold-standard principles but for the digital age. At the time of the announcement, blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence estimated that the US government controlled nearly $18.3 billion in crypto, including over 198,000 BTC. More countries are considering strategic crypto reserves While the US continues to shape its digital asset policy, several other countries have already moved ahead with similar strategies in the meantime. The latest entrant is Kazakhstan, where President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev announced the creation of a National Digital Asset Fund as part of his vision for a new digital financial system. The fund will be managed by the Investment Corporation of the National Bank and would eventually build a reserve of high-potential cryptocurrencies, not limited to Bitcoin. Elsewhere, Brazil has entered the early stages of its own national Bitcoin reserve debate. On August 20, the Chamber of Deputies held a formal hearing to discuss a related bill introduced by Representative Luiz Philippe de Orleans e Bragança, which calls for the creation of a Bitcoin reserve. Meanwhile, in the Philippines, the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act was introduced by Congressman Miguel Luis Villafuerte in August. The bill would mandate the country’s central bank to purchase 2,000 BTC every year over a period of five years. If passed, the country would be able to amass 10,000 BTC in a tightly controlled reserve that would remain locked for two decades, save for cases involving sovereign debt repayment.

Right now, the token has a market cap of $7.69B with a 24-hour trading volume at roughly $267M. Overall, the past 7-day performance has shown a clear upward price movement despite fluctuations, signalling the token’s potential resurgence. Moreover, the RSI for $SHIB, although still neutral , is also showing bullish divergence building. The EMA, meanwhile, is flashing buy signals as $SHIB’s price is testing support at $0.000013 and approaching new key resistance levels. If traders establish support at $0.000013, this could fuel a new rally, helping $SHIB recover to early 2025 levels. Shiba Inu’s resurgence and new bullish momentum are rekindling interest in dog-themed memecoins, steering more speculative capital toward newcomers like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) . Maxi Doge’s gym-bro branding, meme-first marketing, and aggressive presale may do well from spillover demand. In fact, the project is already attracting new whale buys, which have pushed the ICO close to $2M. Increased Retail and Whale Interest in Dog Meme Tokens – What Does It Mean? Most top meme coins , particularly those related to Doge, have seen an upward trend in retail and whale interest recently. The meme sector saw a ~4% increase in market cap today, but doge tokens like $DOGE, $SHIB, and $BONK are ahead of the curve, sporting gains of up to 14% in the last week alone. Additionally, the spike in trading volume strongly indicates momentum is building for these tokens. Investors are now looking to benefit from the speculative hype, with high-risk, high-reward low cap coins making the best risk-on choice for diversification. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is one such example of a booming doge-themed token with strong community support. Although still in presale, this new meme coin is positioning itself as the next big thing in the Doge sector, signalling potential for strong growth in the near future. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Smashes Records Amid Doge Sector Boom — Presale Nears $2M Milestone Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , an Ethereum-based meme coin, is a bit different from your typical cutesy Doge token. Based on a 1000x leverage trading philosophy and high-energy “gym bro” culture, this token comes with dynamic staking rewards (161% APY right now) and futures trading competitions (rolling out after listing). $MAXI’s trading competitions will be possible thanks to trading platforms partnerships. Not only do they make leverage maxing and derivative trading engaging, but the regular contests will also include community prizes, handed out to the top ROI users. Its utility and attractive staking demands do a lot to promote user participation and build an active community. And it’s working. Since launching in July, the presale raised over $1.9M, making it one of the fastest-growing meme ICOs of the year. The most recent whale buy came on September 5 – just over $10K . But we’ve also seen other investors pouring in as much as $37K earlier in August . So far, the presale has over 12,700 transactions recorded, showing a steady increase in early holders. Early adopters get the best discounted prices; $MAXI is now available for $0.0002565, with the next price increase due in just two days. You can claim your tokens in full after the presale ends. At that point, $MAXI will list on Uniswap first thing, giving early investors the opportunity to trade and benefit from $MAXI’s momentum right away. Join $MAXI’s presale before the next price increase. Shiba Inu Recovery Fuels Doge Token Frenzy Recent Shiba Inu technical indicators flash solid buy signals, and the token price is now testing new resistance levels. As Shiba Inu is ready to soar, the rest of the Doge sector is seemingly ready to follow. Maxi Doge is heating up as more early investors and whales join the ICO. The project’s upcoming holder competitions, investor incentives, and booming presale position it as one of the strong contenders in the meme coin landscape in 2025. Now’s the time to slide in early before the real FOMO kicks in. But remember: meme coins are high-risk, high-reward speculative investments. There are no guarantees with coins based on sentiment and hype. Do your own research before investing in any crypto. This article isn’t financial advice.

The project is selling at $0.035. While more traditional tokens like Shiba Inu (SHIB) continue to hold their own in the ecosystem overall, recent hype around Mutuum Finance, from its expanding DeFi usage to heightened investor demand, suggests it may be on the cusp of a pivotal growth phase. Analysts are taking a close look because this under-the-radar asset has the potential to outperform household names in the months ahead, and MUTM’s story is one of the most popular tales in the crypto news this day. Shiba Inu Guides Lagging Momentum Through Market Shift Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading at approximately $0.00001236 currently, with intraday trading within the range of $0.00001217 to $0.00001236. The token continues to falter in September with flat-to-down performance during a period of low trading volumes and waning investor sentiment. Some of the big issues include shrinking derivatives support, as BitMEX withdraws SHIB contracts, persistent underperformance compared to meme coin peers, and persistent structural issues in the form of its enormous token supply and absence of institutional interest. Although it still remains in the spotlight as a result of community-driven narratives and platform innovations like Shibarium, attention is currently shifting towards of decentralized finance platforms like Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Stage 6 Ongoing Mutuum Finance is now in presale stage 6 and offering the tokens for $0.035, which is a 16.17% rise from the last stage. The market is highly eager with more than 16150 invested investors and nearing $15.5 million raised already. In a bid to enhance the security of the platform, there has also been the launch of a USDT Bug Bounty Program with and in partnership with CertiK and up to a combined value of $50,000 USDT. The bugs are segmented under critical, major, minor, and low classes depending on the program. Mutuum Finance asset collateralisation limits are essentially risk type inherent in the asset, i.e., supply, borrow, and collateral limits. The protocol is thus hedging market risk by overcollateralising and additionally incentivising liquidators to liquidate undercollateralised positions. Borrow limits and deposit limits also limit risk exposure to risky or liquid assets and insolvency risk, respectively. Collateral use limit on risky tokens may be very low, and the correlated assets will be collateral effective. Building and Community Development Mutuum Finance has initiated a $100,000 giveaway and community foundation building of users. Ten holders shall receive $10000 MUTM tokens as a reward for bringing in new users and investing in the project. Statistics and Security Key MUTM is a proportion of LTV and subjective collateral and lending and transfer liquidation limits to riskier employment and payment liquidators mechanism. Reserve factor is a proxy to be used instead of what is actually significant in the sense of providing what is referred to as a cushion against default and riskier market and riskier assets are provided with larger reserves. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining momentum as it is targeting an estimated $3.50 price, with far more upside potential than that of Shiba Inu (SHIB) in a stagnant market. Stage 6 tokens are already at $0.035, a 16.17% gain above the last stage, with over 16,150 investors and nearly $15.5M invested. Backed by a $50K CertiK bug bounty, a $100K community giveaway, and strong collateral and risk management controls, MUTM is building a secure, scalable DeFi platform. While SHIB is plagued by low volume and structural issues, Mutuum Finance is out on its growth potential. Lock in your Stage 6 tokens today before the next price surge.

Related Reading: MemeCore Explodes 3,800% For ATH — But Is A Collapse Around The Corner? From a current price of $113,050, that would require an increase of about 35%. There are roughly three months left until December 25. The figures set a clear benchmark for what traders now call the year-end race. Analysts Back A $150,000 Target Saylor tied the call to wider adoption. He said during a CNBC interview more firms adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets and more people learning about the asset will lift demand. Because Bitcoin’s supply is fixed, that demand pressure, he argued, could push prices higher. The tone was confident, and the math was simple: move from $113k to $150,000, an over 30% gain, and the target is met. Tom Lee Puts A Higher Number On The Table Tom Lee, Head of Research at Fundstrat Global, raised the stakes with a $200,000 projection for Christmas 2025. He linked the outlook to macro policy, pointing to the September 17 FOMC meeting as a potential trigger if interest rates are cut. Lee also suggested that gains in small-cap crypto tokens could lift Ethereum, because ETH has often tracked broader risk appetite. A move to $200,000 from $113 would be much larger — roughly a 70% increase — and would likely need strong macro support. At the same time, seasonal patterns matter: Bitcoin often sees strong performance in the fourth quarter. Those two factors together are why some analysts are comfortable with bold targets. But timing is tight. Three months is a short window for large moves, and unexpected events could derail the path. Odds, Research Firms And Other Voices Other voices have weighed in. Canary CEO Steven McClurg put the odds of reaching $150,000 this year at 50%. Large banks like Standard Chartered have even flagged $200,000 as a possible level for 2025. These projections show a clustering of bullish views, though they span different timeframes and rely on different assumptions. Related Reading: Altcoins Feel The Pinch As Crypto Market Sentiment Sours Market Reaction And Caveats Bitcoin was up about 1% in the past 24 hours. Price moves of 30% to 70% in short stretches have happened before in crypto, but they are not commonplace and they bring big risks. Traders and investors will have to weigh those forecasts against market data, policy signals from the US Federal Reserve, and daily price action. The quarter ahead looks busy, and outcomes will depend on more than one forecast coming true.

The blue-chip asset is up 3% today, joining a broader market trend. However, according to historical data shared by top crypto pundit Lark Davies, ADA could ramp things up with a 44% price rally.Cardano Bull Pennant BreakoutSpecifically, he based this bullish outlook on a breakout from a bullish pennant on the daily timeframe yesterday. After a period of price consolidation within the structure, which spanned from the August 14 high of $1.020 until September 7, Cardano has finally broken free. Cardano Bull Pennant Breakout/Lark Davies Notably, this setup could spur a substantial price rally for Cardano . Davis identified that ADA surged 44% in a few weeks the last time this happened. For context, Cardano formed a similar pattern from a high of $0.935 in July 21 and trended within it until an August 3 breakout. Upon defying the pattern, it surged 44% to reach the current structure’s starting point at $1.02 on August 14. While history may not actually repeat, it often rhymes. As a result, Davis questioned if this might set ADA up for a 44% rally from its breakout point of $0.836. Notably, this would see Cardano reach $1.205, which is 36% away from its current market price.Multiple Confirmations of Cardano Price BreakoutMeanwhile, analyst Ali Martinez also confirmed that Cardano has broken out. He shared in an X post today, predicting that the token’s next target is $0.92.An accompanying chart also shows that ADA emerged from a bull pennant, but on the 4-hour timeframe. Cardano also broke out on September 7 and has sustained the breakout , supporting the bullish outlook. Cardano Breakout/Ali Martinez The rally to $0.92 aligns with the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level, representing a mere 4% rally from the current market price.Moreover, TapTools’ X handle highlighted the recent downtrend breakout, forecasting a potential rally to over $1. Notably, there are much higher price expectations for Cardano, with a notable analyst claiming that selling below $5 is selling short of the token’s bullish potential this cycle.",Market|Latest Cardano (ADA) Crypto News Today,EN,0,0,TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|ADA|MARKET,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-09-09 09:30:36

Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains one of the most popular tokens, while Based Eggman ($GGs) has emerged as a presale rival combining meme culture with streaming and gaming features. For new buyers, the question is simple: how to buy Shiba Inu (SHIB) and how to join the Based Eggman ($GGs) presale. Analysts say these two represent the best memecoins to own this cycle. How to Buy Shiba Inu (SHIB) on Major Exchanges Shiba Inu (SHIB) is widely available across major centralized exchanges, making it one of the easiest meme tokens to purchase. Buyers can set up accounts on Binance, Coinbase, or KuCoin, fund their wallets with fiat or stablecoins, and trade directly for SHIB. Decentralized exchanges like Uniswap also offer access for those preferring self-custody. The broad availability of Shiba Inu (SHIB) highlights its status as a legacy meme coin, but analysts warn that despite being easy to buy, its growth has slowed compared to its peak years. How to Join the Based Eggman ($GGs) Presale In contrast, Based Eggman ($GGs) is only available through its official presale site at $0.006389 per token. Investors need a Web3 wallet such as MetaMask or Coinbase Wallet and can connect directly to the presale dashboard. Purchases can be made using ETH, BNB, or USDT, with tokens credited to the wallet after approval. With a capped supply of 389 million, scarcity is built into the system. For early buyers, joining the Based Eggman ($GGs) presale represents an opportunity to secure tokens before listings on major exchanges. Why Analysts Recommend Holding Both Owning both Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Based Eggman ($GGs) provides a balanced strategy. SHIB offers liquidity and brand recognition, while $GGs provides presale upside and integrated utility through streaming, gaming, and trading features. Together, they represent the best memecoins for different stages of the cycle: one stable, one early growth. Analysts argue that this combination allows investors to benefit from both legacy strength and presale innovation. The Evolution of Meme Coin Investments Meme coins are no longer just speculative assets. Based Eggman ($GGs) demonstrates how presales can merge entertainment and blockchain, creating sustainable demand. Shiba Inu (SHIB), while still relevant, has struggled with price stagnation. With SHIB trading at $0.000012 and down 44% year-to-date, investors see Based Eggman ($GGs) as the more dynamic play. This evolution shows why holding both tokens positions investors to capture maximum gains in 2025. Conclusion: Best Memecoins to Buy Now For those asking how to buy the best memecoins, the process is clear. Shiba Inu (SHIB) can be purchased directly from top exchanges, while Based Eggman ($GGs) requires joining its presale through the official site. Together, they represent the two sides of meme coin investment: established liquidity and new presale energy. For maximum exposure to meme coin growth, owning both SHIB and Based Eggman ($GGs) is the winning play.

Two tokens currently stand out: Little Pepe (LILPEPE) and Arbitrum (ARB). Both sit below the $0.50 threshold yet are being positioned by analysts as candidates to replicate XRP’s early momentum. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) – The Meme-Powered Layer-2 With Real Utility Next Stage Price: $0.0022 Current Stage (12): $0.0021 USD Raised: $24,205,467 / $25,475,000 Tokens Sold: 15,145,459,776 / 15,750,000,000 (96.16% complete) Little Pepe is not just another meme coin; it’s a Layer-2 blockchain engineered for speed, security, and ultra-low fees, all wrapped in the cultural force of memes. At its core lies $LILPEPE, the utility token powering the network. This positions it as more than just a community token; it’s infrastructure with humor at its heart. Security First: CertiK Audit Success Little Pepe recently hit a significant milestone with the CertiK audit, scoring an outstanding 95.49%. This audit checked everything you want to see in a top-notch project: strong smart contract logic, solid access controls, and full ERC-20 compliance. Thanks to these findings, any worries about possible vulnerabilities were wiped out. In an environment where rug pulls and weak contracts plague DeFi, this certification gives investors confidence that $LILPEPE is built on secure foundations. Tokenomics That Favor Early Believers Little Pepe’s allocation strategy is designed to reward presale participants and ensure long-term liquidity: 26.5% – Presale: For early adopters riding the wave before listings. 30% – Chain Reserves: Reserved to support the Layer-2 ecosystem. 10% – Liquidity: To maintain smooth trading and market depth. 10% – DEX Allocation: For decentralized exchange listings. 10% – Marketing: To fuel meme virality across social platforms. 13.5% – Staking & Rewards: Incentivizing long-term holders. 0% – Tax: True DeFi spirit with zero buy/sell tax. This fair distribution means no predatory practices—just meme-driven growth and scalability. Community-First With Massive Giveaway To celebrate its presale success, Little Pepe is launching a $777,000 giveaway where 10 lucky winners receive $77,000 worth of $LILPEPE. Why LILPEPE Could Rival XRP’s Growth XRP found its niche by solving cross-border remittances. LILPEPE, by contrast, is carving out an entirely new category: a meme-powered Layer-2 blockchain where sniper bots won’t work, fees are negligible, and meme culture drives adoption. If it captures the same viral enthusiasm as Dogecoin or Pepe Coin while delivering real blockchain infrastructure, it could experience the exponential growth that made XRP’s early investors wealthy. Arbitrum (ARB) – Scaling Ethereum With Capital Inflows While meme culture propels Little Pepe, Arbitrum (ARB) has positioned itself as one of crypto's most important scaling solutions. With Ethereum gas fees often pricing out smaller participants, Arbitrum offers a faster, cheaper environment without sacrificing Ethereum’s security. Price and Support Levels ARB is priced at approximately $0.50, comfortably above its 200 EMA support at $0.47. Over recent swings, this average has repeatedly served as a springboard for buyers, signalling strength each time. Chart watchers note that as long as ARB stays above this $0.47 line, upward targets of $0.55 and $0.60 come into play, having earlier stalled rallies and provided resistance. Holding this level on a daily close would likely attract fresh bullish interest, setting the stage for a rebound towards those following round numbers. Ecosystem Inflows Show Strong Demand The most bullish signal for Arbitrum is capital flow. In just one week, nearly $872 million poured into the ecosystem, dwarfing other chains and reinforcing confidence among developers and investors alike. This demonstrates more than speculative hype, it shows robust demand for Arbitrum as the leading Ethereum scaling option. Supply Unlock Risk Despite substantial inflows, risks remain. A 92.65 million ARB token unlock worth nearly $48 million is set for September 16th, representing just over 2% of the circulating supply. Unlocks often cause volatility, as additional tokens can create short-term selling pressure. Analysts are urging caution, but Arbitrum’s fundamentals suggest it can weather such events. Final Words With Little Pepe (LILPEPE) and Arbitrum (ARB) trading under $0.50, investors have a rare chance to position themselves early in projects that could rival Ripple’s early trajectory. Whether it’s LILPEPE’s meme-fueled Layer-2 innovation or Arbitrum’s scaling dominance, both offer unique paths to exponential growth. If you don’t want to miss the next wave, now is the time to act.

Both are backed by unique attributes that set them apart in the bustling crypto market. Overview of Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Little Pepe stands out primarily due to its integration of meme culture with serious blockchain technology. It operates as a Layer-2 solution aiming to enhance blockchain scalability and efficiency, all the while fostering a community through its humorous and engaging meme-centric approach. The token mechanics are specially structured to benefit early adopters and support long-term operational viability. Here’s a breakdown of their financial strategy and token distribution: Presale Allocation: 26.5% to cater to early investors. Chain Reserves: 30% reserved to bolster the blockchain infrastructure. Liquidity: 10% to ensure fluid market movements. DEX Allocation: Another 10% designated for decentralized exchanges. Marketing: 10%, vital for community engagement and growth. Staking Rewards: 13.5% to reward the community for their loyalty. No transaction taxes are implemented, maintaining the decentralized spirit of the project. This distribution strategy supports both scalability and the meme-driven appeal of the token. Moreover, to cement its market stance, Little Pepe has successfully passed a security audit by CertiK, achieving a high score of 95.49%, which asserts its security and reliability in the DeFi space. There is also an ongoing contest where participants can win a significant amount of $LILPEPE, further adding to its community-centric approach. Introduction to Arbitrum (ARB) While Little Pepe leverages meme culture, Arbitrum focuses on being a powerful scaling solution for Ethereum, addressing issues like high gas fees and slow transaction times without compromising on security. Priced around $0.50, it's positioned well above its 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which has acted as a reliable support level during market fluctuations. Demand for Arbitrum is highlighted by the substantial capital inflow of nearly $872 million into its ecosystem within a single week, emphasizing its importance and potential for further growth. Comparative Growth and Market Position Both cryptocurrencies exhibit unique strengths: Little Pepe in the realm of decentralized, meme-driven blockchains, and Arbitrum in scalable, secure blockchain solutions. Their strategic positioning under $0.50 makes them attractive for investors looking for affordability coupled with high growth potential. In conclusion, both Little Pepe and Arbitrum represent emerging opportunities in the cryptocurrency market that could potentially follow in the footsteps of Ripple's success story. Interested parties should consider these options for their diverse approaches and potential market impact.

These early entry points offer a chance to join projects before they mature. Among the growing list of top crypto presales, Based Eggman ($GGs) has captured attention by mixing gaming, streaming, and meme culture into a single ecosystem. This presale coin is shaping its place in the larger Web3 landscape, attracting both gaming enthusiasts and traders. With XRP holders now scouting for alternative ventures, the Based Eggman presale crypto has emerged as one of the best crypto presales to buy right now. Based Eggman ($GGs): Gaming, Culture, and Tokens in One Based Eggman ($GGs) is a presale crypto project that combines gaming, trading tools, and streaming features inside one platform. This new crypto token presale is built on Base, Coinbase’s Layer-2 chain known for speed and low fees.

XRP Smart Money Searching for Stronger ROI Investments For years, XRP has been seen as a reliable option among established crypto assets. However, as markets shift, XRP faces challenges in gaining new momentum. Smart money often rotates into token presales when established projects slow down. With XRP struggling to capture the same attention it once held, investors are scanning through new crypto presale coins for stronger opportunities. This is where projects like Based Eggman stand out. Unlike XRP, which is already a mature asset, $GGs offers early entry into a presale cryptocurrency with defined tokenomics and multi-use cases across gaming and Web3. XRP Holders Rotating Into Based Eggman ($GGs) The movement of capital from older cryptocurrencies into presale crypto tokens is a common trend. Investors with XRP are increasingly looking at presale crypto projects where early involvement can bring wider exposure. Based Eggman’s gaming-first approach and its connection to meme culture make it appealing to XRP holders seeking variety in their portfolios. With $GGs tokens fueling streaming, gaming, and even DeFi tools, the ecosystem gives presale participants several avenues for engagement. Unlike XRP, which focuses on established cross-border payment solutions, Based Eggman represents cultural and entertainment-driven Web3 crypto presale growth.

A groundbreaking development, the Nasdaq Gemini investment , signals a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry. This strategic move sees one of the world’s leading stock exchanges pouring capital into a prominent U.S. crypto platform, setting the stage for exciting future possibilities. What Does This Nasdaq Gemini Investment Mean for Crypto? Nasdaq, a global powerhouse in the stock exchange arena, has made a decisive move into the cryptocurrency sector. The company has agreed to purchase a substantial $50 million in shares of Gemini, a well-known U.S. cryptocurrency exchange. This investment is slated to occur at the time of Gemini’s eagerly anticipated Initial Public Offering (IPO), according to reports from Reuters, citing informed sources. This Nasdaq Gemini investment is not just about capital; it’s a powerful endorsement from a major financial institution. Previously, Bitcoin World had reported on Gemini’s proactive steps towards going public. The exchange officially filed for an IPO with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), aiming to raise a significant sum of up to $317 million. This commitment from Nasdaq further solidifies Gemini’s position and adds considerable weight to its public offering prospects. Why is Traditional Finance Embracing Digital Assets? Many are asking why established players like Nasdaq are increasingly looking towards the crypto market. The answer lies in the undeniable growth and potential of digital assets. Traditional financial institutions recognize the long-term value and disruptive capabilities of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. By investing in companies like Gemini, Nasdaq is positioning itself at the forefront of this financial evolution. Market Expansion: Tapping into a new, rapidly growing asset class. Technological Innovation: Leveraging blockchain for future financial infrastructure. Diversification: Spreading investment risk across different market segments. Client Demand: Responding to increasing institutional and retail interest in crypto. The Road Ahead for Gemini’s IPO and the Nasdaq Gemini Investment Gemini’s journey to an IPO is a significant event for the entire crypto ecosystem. An IPO allows a private company to offer its shares to the public, raising capital for expansion and operations. With a fundraising target of up to $317 million, Gemini aims to bolster its services, enhance security, and expand its global reach. The Nasdaq Gemini investment provides a crucial layer of credibility and financial backing, potentially making Gemini’s IPO more attractive to other institutional investors and the broader market. This partnership suggests a future where traditional financial markets and digital asset markets become more interconnected. It represents a maturation of the crypto industry, moving from niche technology to a recognized and valuable component of the global economy. What are the Key Benefits of This Alliance? The collaboration between Nasdaq and Gemini brings forth several advantages: Enhanced Legitimacy: A major exchange like Nasdaq investing in crypto lends significant credibility to the entire digital asset space, helping to alleviate skepticism. Capital for Growth: The $50 million investment provides Gemini with substantial funds to innovate, scale operations, and improve its offerings. Increased Institutional Confidence: This move could encourage other traditional financial institutions to explore or increase their exposure to cryptocurrencies. Broader Market Access: It helps bridge the gap between traditional investors and the crypto market, potentially drawing in new capital. Regulatory Compliance: Nasdaq’s involvement might indirectly promote higher standards of regulatory compliance within the crypto sector, as Gemini operates under stringent U.S. regulations. Navigating Potential Challenges in the Digital Asset Space While the outlook is largely positive, it is important to acknowledge the inherent challenges in the digital asset space. Regulatory clarity remains an ongoing process, with bodies like the SEC continuously shaping the rules. Market volatility is another persistent factor that investors must consider. Despite these hurdles, the long-term trend points towards greater integration of digital assets into mainstream finance. The Nasdaq Gemini investment serves as a powerful testament to the growing acceptance and institutional belief in the future of cryptocurrencies. It’s a clear signal that digital assets are here to stay and will continue to shape the financial landscape for years to come. The strategic Nasdaq Gemini investment marks a watershed moment in the convergence of traditional finance and the burgeoning world of digital assets. This significant capital injection by Nasdaq into Gemini’s upcoming IPO not only validates the potential of cryptocurrency exchanges but also paves the way for greater institutional participation. It’s a clear indication that the future of finance is increasingly digital, and major players are eager to be a part of this transformative journey.

Cryptocurrency gains 6.15% of its value. GRT coin faces resistance at $0.0944. On September 9, 2025, The Graph price analysis revealed an increasing trend. The altcoin’s value has increased to $0.0920 in the past 24 hours. At the same time, the currency gained 6.15% of its value today. Despite the minimal price movement for the past two trading sessions, today, market events remained favorable for the bulls as the token’s value has increased. The Graph 1-day chart analysis The one-day price chart of The Graph confirmed a bullish trend in the market. The cryptocurrency’s value has increased to $0.0920 over the last 24 hours. In addition, the high volatility levels suggest a higher chance of a reversal. The distance between the Bollinger bands defines the volatility. This distance is wide, leading to high volatility in the market. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance, has moved to $0.0994. Conversely, its lower limit, serving as the support, has moved to $0.0827. GRT/USD 1-day price chart. Image source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator confirms the recent upturn in price. Its score has increased to index 51.15 today, and is trending in the neutral range. However, if the bullish momentum continues to grow, further stability in the market can be expected. The Graph 4-hour chart analysis The four-hour price analysis of The Graph coin also referred to a bullish trend in the market. Buyers are now aiming for an increase above the current level on the GRT/USD price chart, but have not succeeded yet. The Bollinger Bands are diverging, resulting in increasing volatility. This increase in volatility signifies higher market unpredictability. Moving forward, the upper Bollinger Band has shifted to $0.0920, indicating the resistance point that the token just broke above. Conversely, the lower Bollinger Band has moved to $0.0854, securing the support. GRT/USD 4-hour price chart.

The Graph rivals some Web2 data oracles for its efficiency and low costs. GRT, its native token, however, remains a victim of general market dynamics and high volatility. If observed over the larger picture, the current sentiment is bearish, with predictions pointing to higher price growth. It is advised to do your own research and conduct investment advice before investing in the volatile market. What can we expect from GRT price analysis next? The Graph price analysis gives a relatively bullish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. The coin’s value has increased to $0.0920 in the past 24 hours. A continuation of the current price action might bring further chances for investors. The increasing volatility on the daily chart shows that there is a high chance of further price oscillation, which, if it happens, can lead to a price above $0.0944. Why is GRT up? The increase in the Graph’s value could be attributed to the general market sentiment. Moreover, the past few days supported the bulls, as the price was increasing, so the coin is moving up today after finding support. Will GRT reach $0.5? Yes, GRT should rise above $0.5 in 2029. In that year, the price will range between $0.497592 and $0.555007. Will GRT reach $1? Per the analysts’ price predictions, it remains unlikely that GRT will get to $1 by 2031. Will GRT reach $10? Considering GRT’s current price and market cap, it remains highly unlikely that it will reach $10 in the next ten years. Does GRT have a good long-term future? According to the market assumptions, GRT is set to trade higher in the years to come. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Hence, it is advised to do your own research and conduct in-depth investment advice before investing in the volatile market.

With critical inflation data and a Federal Reserve meeting on the horizon, he is labeling the rally as a sophisticated trap for overeager retail investors. Exit Pump Risk as Macro Events Loom In a detailed post on X, analyst Doctor Profit issued a stark warning to his nearly 432,000 followers, drawing a parallel to an accurate bearish call he’d made a month ago. “I explicitly warned that market makers would push altcoins higher in the following days and weeks to create a perfect illusion for retail,” claimed the analyst. He explained that the strategy uses attractive price increases as a distraction during a distribution phase at market tops. Furthermore, he argued that the current push is not the beginning of a sustained ‘altseason’ but a “short-lived exit pump” where retail investors are unwittingly providing the liquidity for larger players to sell. “What we’re seeing now is exactly that: a manufactured altcoin rally designed to trap late buyers while the real money quietly exits.” According to him, retail traders are blindly buying into alts out of the fear of missing out, while ignoring macro risks such as the PPI due on Wednesday, CPI on Thursday, and the FOMC meeting that’s only eight days out. His warning comes at a time when public opinion is still split. Recently, analytics platform CryptoQuant noted that coins like Fetch.ai (FET), Amp (AMP), and Synthetix (SNX) were leaving Binance, meaning some investors believe they might be able to make money in the short term off those tokens. On the other hand, analysts like Ash Crypto have said that if Bitcoin’s dominance starts to fade, it could start a “Mega Altseason” between October and March next year, with a lot of money moving into altcoins. However, data from the past tells a different story. Earlier in the month, IntoTheCryptoverse founder Benjamin Cowen said that BTC’s dominance is likely to rise regardless of the way the cryptocurrency’s price goes. He cautioned that altcoins will have a hard time keeping up with Bitcoin if it goes up, down, or stays around key moving averages. Bitcoin Holds Steady Even with the noise around altcoins, Bitcoin continues to anchor the market. At the time of this writing, the OG crypto had gained 1.5% in the last 24 hours and 2.5% over the week, bringing its price to $113,167. Despite the modest uptick, the asset is still down 4.2% in the last 30 days, and nearly 9% below its peak of $124,457. Over the last day, trading volume was more than $42 billion, showing that there is still plenty of liquidity even as speculation about altcoins heats up.

According to a press statement released by the bank on Monday, the partnership, which included tech company IBM, will see BBVA integrate Ripple’s digital asset custody technology into its recently launched retail platform that allows customers to buy, sell, and hold crypto such as Bitcoin and Ether. BBVA, IBM, and Ripple to partner for custodial services After a successful pilot project in 2023, BBVA is now scaling up the service through Garanti BBVA Kripto, the Turkish subsidiary that has already launched a regulated digital asset trading platform. The service reportedly caters to more than 14,000 users, providing access to assets including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), USD Coin (USDC), Avalanche (AVAX), Chiliz (CHZ), XRP, Arbitrum (ARB), and Solana (SOL). Ripple provides custody services, and IBM provides safe infrastructure. Korcan Abalı, chief executive and board member of Garanti BBVA Kripto, said customer demand was the driving force behind the expansion. “There has been a sharp increase in demand for digital assets among our customers. We launched Garanti BBVA Digital Assets in 2023 to meet this demand, and today we continue to see more customers transferring and storing crypto assets every day. Our collaboration with Ripple and IBM gives us the confidence of having secure custody, robust governance, and compliant processes,” he asserted. IBM’s Türkiye general manager, Işıl Kılınç Gürtuna, told the press that the American firm will provide advanced infrastructure solutions for the custody business. Ripple advances Europe reach under MiCA In her statement on Garanti BBVA, Ripple executive and Europe managing director Cassie Craddock said the introduction of the EU’s Market in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation has created a more favorable environment for banks. “Now that MiCA is established, the region’s banks are emboldened to launch the digital asset offerings that their customers are asking for,” she surmised. Ripple Custody was developed after the company acquired Swiss crypto custody firm Metaco, which had previously signed up BBVA as a client. The acquisition gave Ripple a technological framework to service large financial institutions interested in digital assets, under MiCA’s strict compliance standards. “Secure custody is foundational to unlocking value and addressing the growing demand for new asset classes across the digital economy,” remarked Aaron Sears, senior vice president of global customer and partner success at Ripple. VivoPower adds RLUSD payments Earlier today, London-based VivoPower International announced that its electric vehicle subsidiary, Tembo e-LV, is now accepting payments in Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD. The Nasdaq-listed company was founded in 2014 has business units in the United Kingdom, Australia, North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. The company is making changes in its business model to become an XRP-focused digital asset enterprise, which will see it acquire, manage, and hold XRP as a treasury, along with equity investments in Ripple Labs. Meanwhile, Ripple’s token XRP is trading at about $3, consolidating within a defined range that has yet to cross $3.1 in the last seven days after momentum in the token cooled. After a rally in July, the crypto has struggled to break above the resistance zone between $3.4 and $3.5. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Launching today and offering a 10% Annual Percentage Yield (APY), Stablecoin Earn Plus delivers one of the highest returns among self-custodial wallets and other exchange-based savings options. By integrating Aave’s lending pools and Bitget Wallet’s subsidies, the initiative primarily seeks to offer dollar-backed yield and immediate fund access. “Bitget Wallet is making Aave’s yields simple to access for more people globally. By connecting easy-to-use wallets with trusted onchain markets, everyday savers can now benefit from open and transparent finance,” said Stani Kulechov, Founder of Aave Labs. Bitget Wallet also collaborated with service provider TokenLogic to ensure the integration aligns with Aave’s long-term sustainability goals. Namely, the offering is based on the protocol’s interest-bearing aTokens, which deliver yields to users in real time. Accordingly, the framework could later be extended to other assets via Bitget Wallet’s global distribution. Stablecoin Earn Plus Stablecoin Earn Plus: Source: Bitget Wallet As part of the partnership, new deposits are channeled into Aave’s overcollateralized lending pools on the Base network. At the same time, Bitget Wallet provides yield subsidies to ensure a minimum 10% APY on balances up to $10,000. Starting from as little as $1, and with earnings accruing over time with instant fund withdrawals, the product is designed for flexibility and accessibility while also integrating security features such as Bitget Wallet’s $700 million User Protection Fund. Following up on Stani Kulechov’s comments regarding decentralized yields becoming more accessible to everyday savers, Bitget Wallet Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) Jamie Elkaleh further highlighted the importance of bringing institutional-grade opportunities to retail users: “Partnering with Aave allows us to connect institutional-grade yield opportunities with a wider user base…. It’s a practical step toward our vision of making crypto simple enough to be part of everyday life, for everyone.” To celebrate the launch, Stablecoin Earn Plus will offer an 18% APY during the first week (September 9–15). Additionally, Bitget Wallet revealed it plans to include other stablecoins , protocols, and networks in the future.

Strategy Has Just Added 1,955 Tokens To Its Bitcoin Treasury In a new post on X, Strategy co-founder and chairman Michael Saylor has revealed the details related to the latest Bitcoin purchase made by the company. The buy involved 1,955 BTC and costed the firm about $111,196 per token or a total of $217 million. The acquisition has raised Strategy’s holdings to 638,460 BTC. With the current supply of the cryptocurrency standing at 19,917,900 coins, the treasury company’s stack alone accounts for 3.2% of all BTC in circulation. Like is tradition, the Monday purchase was preceded by a Saylor X post on Sunday with the company’s treasury portfolio tracker. This time, the chairman used the caption “Needs More Orange.” Strategy has been quite active with its Bitcoin buying over the past few months, announcing a purchase almost every week. Here’s how the latest buy compares against the past ones, according to a chart shared by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn . As displayed in the above graph, the latest acquisition completed by the company is relatively small, with both the last two buys of 4,048 BTC and 3,081 BTC being larger. The last five buys all pale in comparison to some of the purchases made earlier in the year, however, implying a bit of a slowdown for the company in general. While buying may no longer be as intense anymore, the firm’s reserves are still holding up well in terms of profitability. The company’s stack currently values at $71.82 billion, which puts it around 52.26% above water compared to its investment of $47.17 billion. Demand from Bitcoin treasury companies as a whole has been down recently, as pointed out by Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards in an X post . The above chart shows the trend in the BTC treasury company buyers participating in accumulation every day. At the peak of the frenzy in July, the rate of these firms purchasing per day stood at more than 3.8. Today, this value has dropped to just 2.2. “Treasury Company demand continues to collapse,” notes Edwards. Though, while demand may be dropping, it’s still significantly higher than historical levels, at least for now. Speaking of treasuries, a new company has joined in on the craze, Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange HashKey. According to a press release , HashKey is planning to launch a digital asset treasury fund with a first-phase fundraising target of $500 million. The exchange will put an initial emphasis on initiating and investing into Ethereum and Bitcoin ecosystem digital asset treasury projects.

51440464,https://timestabloid.com/?p=82424,1757412055,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Best Cheap Crypto Now: Sub-$1 DeFi Coin Ready to Outpace DOGE and SHIB, Here Is Why",https://timestabloid.com/best-cheap-crypto-now-sub-1-defi-coin-ready-to-outpace-doge/,"As DOGE and SHIB continue to struggle with limited real-world adoption and slow growth, retail traders and crypto enthusiasts are searching for alternative crypto coins that combine practical utility with strong growth potential. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , priced at $0.035, will emerge as a highly structured DeFi play that delivers both predictable stablecoin yields and staking rewards, positioning itself as a compelling alternative to meme-driven hype. Analysts expect this project to outpace many sub-$1 tokens due to its functional design and transparent roadmap, appealing to investors who are scrutinizing crypto charts for reliable opportunities in a market where why crypto is down remains a frequent question. Stablecoin Mechanics and Borrowing Infrastructure Not Found in DOGE or SHIB Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will offer a decentralized stablecoin pegged to $1, providing consistent lending and borrowing incentives. The stablecoin will be minted only when users borrow against overcollateralized bluechip assets such as ETH, AVAX, MATIC, and BNB, and will be burned upon loan repayment or liquidation. All loans will remain overcollateralized, with automatic liquidations triggered if collateral values fall below predefined thresholds. Governance-managed interest rates will maintain the $1 peg, while arbitrage mechanisms will provide market equilibrium, ensuring stable operations even during periods of heightened volatility. The protocol’s price discovery will rely on robust Chainlink oracle integrations, delivering real-time, multi-chain asset valuations. Fallback oracles, aggregated feeds, and on-chain DEX pricing will provide additional reliability, preventing discrepancies and enhancing user confidence. Borrow interest rates will adjust dynamically according to pool utilization, incentivizing borrowing during high liquidity periods and increasing yields when capital is scarce. These features will support predictable earnings and will create a trustable ecosystem for investors focused on long-term growth and sustainable crypto investing. Phase 6 of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has already generated $15.5 million, with 35% of the 170 million token supply sold and more than 16,200 holders participating. The current price of $0.035 is set to increase to $0.040 in Phase 7, representing a 15% advance. Security is reinforced by a CertiK audit, achieving a Token Scan score of 95 and a Skynet score of 78, providing strong assurances for investors. A $100,000 giveaway will distribute $10,000 each to ten winners, while a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty will reward participants identifying potential vulnerabilities, ranging from $2,000 for critical issues to $200 for minor findings. These features will establish investor confidence and highlight the platform’s commitment to security and transparency. mtToken Staking, Buybacks, and Roadmap Progress Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will enable investors to stake mtTokens in designated smart contracts, earning ongoing rewards in MUTM tokens. The platform will allocate a portion of its revenue from lending and borrowing activities to open market buybacks, which will support price appreciation and provide sustained buying pressure. This structure will enhance investor confidence and encourage long-term participation, making MUTM a standout choice among sub-$1 crypto coins. The roadmap will guide the platform’s expansion over four phases. Phase 1 will execute the presale, marketing campaigns, AI-powered helpdesk, and external audit, with educational content and legal/compliance teams set to follow. Phase 2 will focus on core smart contract development, front-end and back-end DApp creation, analytics tools, and risk management. Phase 3 will include a beta test, functional demo, exchange preparation, and final security audits, culminating in the conclusion of the presale. Phase 4 will deliver the live platform, token listings on major exchanges, mtToken staking activation, multi-chain expansion, institutional partnerships, and platform enhancements. Early Phase 1 investors who swapped ETH and SOL for MUTM at $0.01 will already realize 3.5x gains at the current Phase 6 price of $0.035 on paper. Analysts forecast a post-listing baseline of $0.06, and with the beta launch allowing users to experience the platform’s real utility, combined with exchange adoption, the token’s value will reach $0.50–$1 in future months. Layer-2 integration will enhance transaction speed and reduce costs, increasing adoption and accelerating token demand across the DeFi ecosystem. With meme coins underperforming, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will present a safer, structured, and highly functional investment alternative. Phase 6’s strong presale performance, staking incentives, stablecoin mechanics, and buyback-supported growth will create significant FOMO among retail investors. Acquiring MUTM at $0.035 before the Phase 7 increase to $0.040 will provide early participants with access to predictable yields and upward price momentum, positioning this sub-$1 DeFi coin as a breakout leader in the current market.

Here’s the Next Target,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-price-will-shock-you-today-heres-the-next-target/,"Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto), a popular crypto analyst, recently shared a video emphasizing what he describes as a pivotal development for XRP. On the daily chart, he noted that the token is currently attempting to break out of a falling wedge pattern . He described this as a positive signal but stressed that confirmation depends on the close of the daily candle. According to him, if the candle closes near its current level within the next 15 to 20 hours, the breakout can be considered confirmed. He explained that if confirmation holds, XRP could begin moving higher in the coming days. Price levels remain consistent with his earlier analysis, where he set $3.6 as the initial target, before a rise above its all-time high to $4, $4.61, and $5. #XRP PRICE WILL SHOCK YOU TODAY!!!!!!!! pic.twitter.com/tKb7DU8ZqH — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) September 8, 2025 Key Price Levels to Watch While optimistic, the analyst also cautioned against dismissing downside risks. He mentioned that if the current daily candle closes under $2.87, the breakout setup could fail. A close above $2.91, on the other hand, would reinforce the bullish structure. While XRP struggled below $2.87 in the early days of September, the asset experienced a notable recovery on September 7 . Now it must stay above that crucial support level. Steph emphasized that the broader market structure remains constructive, stating that XRP still follows a higher-high, higher-low formation when viewed on a longer time frame. He argued that this performance supports the expectation of more upside, provided the market respects these technical levels. His approach places importance on letting the trend guide trading decisions, noting that the overall momentum for XRP remains to the upside. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Following the Trend to Higher Targets Steph further examined XRP’s performance using the three-day time frame. He pointed to the stochastic RSI, which is currently oversold. He recalled that previous oversold readings on this indicator have coincided with substantial upward moves in XRP’s price. Based on this, he believes that the token is entering what he described as a “moment of opportunity,” especially if the current daily candle closes above the key threshold near $2.91. According to his analysis, a confirmed breakout could lay the groundwork for XRP to progress toward higher targets . He stressed the importance of monitoring each level and following the trend.

In 2010, Bitcoin was worth a few cents. One year later, it hit $20. In six years, it was $17,000, and now it’s sitting at over $100K, after hitting an ATH of $123K in July. Historically, if you’d invested in Bitcoin at launch, you’d have an ROI of 188,643,000%. The likes of Mastercard, JP Morgan, and scores of S&P 500 companies are buying Bitcoin in droves. There’s never been anything like Bitcoin before, and investors are waking up to that reality. However, Bitcoin is getting old for modern standards. No dApps, no smart contracts, and almost non-existent DeFi scalability. It needs an upgrade. And that’s what Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is here to do with Layer-2 technology. Click to learn more about Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a crypto project planning to launch the fastest Layer-2 chain for Bitcoin. Its goal – to bring Bitcoin’s blockchain to modern standards. This means compatibility with dApps, smart contracts, and seamless DeFi programmability for developers. The L2 will run on a Canonical Bridge, combined with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), for native compatibility with Solana. You’ll be able to build token programs, LP logic, oracles, games, NFT infrastructure, DAOs, and much more. All without reinventing the wheel. To engage with the L2, you’ll deposit $BTC to a designated address monitored by the Canonical Bridge. The Relay Program verifies the details, and then mints an equivalent number of wrapped $BTC on the L2. You can also withdraw your original $BTC at any time.

HOW TO BUY $HYPER Today’s Bitcoin Technical Analysis Bitcoin’s breakout from a falling wedge pattern last week has firmly set an uptrend in motion. The token continues to push higher, posting a modest but meaningful 0.79% gain so far today. Even better, $BTC has already established a solid short-term support level on the lower timeframes. As shown in the image below, an upward-sloping trendline on the 15-minute chart is holding $BTC’s latest run-up firmly in place. On top of that, all key exponential moving averages (EMAs) – the 20, 50, 100, and 200 – are now stacked in bullish order on these lower timeframes, providing yet another confirmation of Bitcoin’s rebound. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s immediate target is its most recent swing high of $113,391.61. Once the token successfully breaks this level, it will be in the best position to march toward its all-time highs. Kazakhstan Plans Strategic Crypto Reserve by 2026, As Bitcoin Hyper Nears $15M September 9, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Kazakhstan is preparing to launch a full-fledged ecosystem of digital assets. On Monday, President Tokayev proposed a State Digital Asset Fund in his annual address and asked lawmakers to finalize a digital asset law before 2026. Managed by the National Bank’s investment corporation, the fund will accumulate some of the most promising digital assets in the world. As governments around the world proactively embrace crypto, both institutional and retail capital flow to the industry is set to grow. Although the $BTC price performance has remained choppy for the last few weeks, its long-term potential remains strong. But investors are thinking beyond $BTC and top altcoins, as the market matures. The new crypto infrastructure project Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), for example, is one of the hottest altcoins this season. The project’s upcoming layer-2 solution for Bitcoin, built using SVM, has sent its viral presale close to $15M. To learn more about Bitcoin Hyper and why it’s one of the best cryptos to buy now, visit the official website . Bitcoin Could Hit $200K – Is Bitcoin Hyper the Layer 2 That Unlocks Its Full Potential? September 9, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Bitcoin could ‘easily’ reach $200K by the end of 2025, according to Fundstrat’s Tom Lee With $BTC currently trading around $113K after peaking at $124K last month, Lee believes September 17 could be a turning point for crypto markets, as analysts expect the central bank to cut interest rates. ‘Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies like Ethereum are super sensitive to monetary policy,’ Lee said, emphasizing how lower interest rates historically inject liquidity and drive asset prices higher. This bullish outlook has revived interest in Bitcoin-aligned projects, especially those offering real utility and faster upside. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), for example, is a next-gen Layer 2 protocol built to supercharge the Bitcoin ecosystem. It enables Bitcoin-native staking, decentralized finance (DeFi), and dApps, bringing smart contracts, scale, and speed to a network known for security but limited flexibility.

Crypto is so unthinkably huge at the moment, a nearly $4 trillion industry that’s aiming for world domination. Recent headlines talk of Circle and Mastercard planning to add USDC to global payment systems, Ethereum and Bitcoin treasuries in the billions of dollars, and Google building its own blockchain. Bitcoin has an all-time growth of over 180,000,000%, Dogecoin over 39,000%, and some of the newest presale coins often pump 10x, 100x, or even 1,000x on rare occasions. Explosive potential is probably the single best description for what we’re seeing today in crypto.

September 9, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Fuelled by the Rex-Osprey DOGE ETF speculation and recent macroeconomic shifts, Dogecoin has posted a 10% gain on the weekly chart. On Tuesday, $DOGE’s 24h trading volume jumped 62% to $3.82B. If the ETF materializes and the trend continues, the meme coin captain could be eyeing a new all-time high by the year-end. But $DOGE is not the only one set to pump. The growing whale traffic to Maxi Doge ($MAXI) hints that it could be the next crypto to explode. While $DOGE has largely saturated with a gigantic market cap of over $35B, the younger cousin is now in its presale phase, and has raised ~$2M already. The Maxi Doge presale is rapidly selling out, as the compelling narrative centered around the unhealthy degen culture sparks interest. To learn more about Maxi Doge and join the presale, visit the official website . Legacy Memes like Shiba Inu Fade, PepeNode Emerges as the Next Crypto to Explode September 9, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen a modest recovery, trading at $0.00001285, up 3% in 24 hours , but it’s still down half a percent year-on-year. This reflects how legacy meme coins which once dominated headlines now struggle to maintain momentum. That’s why experts tip newer, utility-focused meme coins like PepeNode ($PEPENODE) as the next cryptos to explode . Instead of relying on hype alone, PepeNode introduces a unique “mine-to-earn” mechanic, letting holders build virtual rigs and earn meme coin rewards. With a jaw-dropping 1,535% staking rewards and deflationary mechanics, the PepeNodes presale offers greater upside for traders looking beyond $SHIB or $PEPE’s fading spark. In fact, given a successful presale, adoption of its off-chain mine-to-earn game, exchange listings, and favorable market conditions, our PepeNode price prediction projects a 124% ROI by the end of 2025. Find out how to buy PepeNodes and lock in those gains now.

Leveraged shorts cluster at $895, where a breakout could trigger cascading liquidations upward. Open interest at $1.49B signals heavy leverage, raising chances of sharp, liquidation-driven moves. Breakout Above Yearly High BNB moved above last year’s high, which has now turned into a support level. Analyst Crypto Bully called it “one of the best looking charts” and noted that the market is paying little attention to it. $BNB One of the best looking charts and simultaneously the least mentioned of. Price action has been very clean as of recently, we got above last year high which acted as support. As it stands, there’s not much levels to trade since we’re in price discovery however any move… pic.twitter.com/xprjeFaFgB — Crypto Bully (@BullyDCrypto) September 8, 2025 The token trades at around $880 at press time, with a daily volume of $1.10 billion. BNB has gained 1% in the past 24 hours and 3% over the week. The zone around $800 is marked as demand. Any return toward this area could attract bids, though falling back into the previous yearly range would weaken the setup. Meanwhile, BNB is consolidating under $900 after a strong run. With no major resistance levels overhead, the token is in price discovery. In this phase, the market has no defined ceiling, and movement depends on how long demand holds above support. Crypto Bully explained, “Any move back towards the level marked on chart should be a good bid with invalidation being super tight.” The $780–$800 area remains the key level for buyers to watch. Liquidity Cluster at $895 Market watcher CW pointed out a concentration of leveraged short positions near $895. They said, “these positions will be liquidated significantly if price rises to $895.” Liquidity data shows dense order levels at this point. Highly leveraged short positions that are blocking the rise of $BNB will be liquidated significantly if it rises to $895. pic.twitter.com/OB36z0Cdo7 — CW (@CW8900) September 9, 2025 If the asset pushes higher, forced closures of short positions could add buying pressure. This may accelerate the next move upward. For now, BNB is trading in the $875–$885 range, with $895 identified as the level that could open further upside. Open Interest Near Peak Levels Futures open interest in BNB has reached $1.49 billion, one of the highest levels recorded. This shows a sharp rise in leveraged positions, with both long and short traders active at current prices. Source: Coinglass High open interest combined with increasing price has seen sharp swings. If the asset goes further up, short liquidations may enter in the way of gains. Should the market go down, long liquidations may actually generate selling pressure. The extra high open interest indicates that the next move will be fast-paced and will come from liquidations.

This marks the first public company Worldcoin treasury, mirroring prior crypto treasury plays like Bitmine, with similar speculative dynamics and equity dilution risks. Valuation is now almost entirely driven by the anticipated crypto holdings, with significant volatility expected as treasury accumulation progresses. Given the novelty, high uncertainty, and speculative nature, I am initiating coverage with a neutral Hold rating and advise caution for investors. Eightco ( OCTO ) just had a big day, the kind that put the stock up more than 30X in value. It's another ticker that wasn't known for headlines or a big market cap but has been utilized for a crypto treasury strategy. OCTO 5D Price History (Seeking Alpha) With immediate events ongoing and a very volatile price situation ahead, I wanted to get a basic idea out for how to approach this security and am keeping it neutral for now. Change In Plans With a $4.4M market cap just earlier this week, Eightco had operations in Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining, custom corrugated packaging, and funding for e-commerce businesses, with only $154K in earnings for 2024. The announcement came on the morning of September 8. Eightco announced that they would be doing a $250M private placement of their shares on the 11th, with $20M already purchased by Bitmine ( BMNR ), a company I also covered a few weeks ago that recently shifted to a treasury strategy for Ether ( ETH-USD ). Eightco isn't another ETH play, however. They clarified that they would be doing a Worldcoin ( WDC-USD ) treasury strategy. This is the native currency of the World Network, founded in 2019 by none other than Sam Altman. Lastly, they added that the ticker will be changed to ORBS, so it's important for investors who follow along to keep that in mind. Likely Strategy Going Forward While it's the first case of a Worldcoin treasury, it will likely follow the example of Bitmine, as well as other ""crypto treasuries"" that I've observed. BMNR July 2025 Investor Presentation Borrowing one of their slides from their own shift into the ETH treasury, Bitmine believes that network-based cryptos differ crucially from BTC, which many consider ""digital gold."" Bitmine believes native currencies of key blockchain networks, like ETH, are more like ""digital oil,"" commodities with actual utility in an economy. It stands to reason that this is a vote of confidence in Worldcoin and the World Network on the part of Bitmine, particularly its ""Proof of Human"" concept: An anonymous proof of human that securely and privately proves you are a unique human. It supports multiple types of human-exclusive verifications via proof of human credentials, allowing users to prove they are human and unique. These treasury strategies entail issuing copious amounts of equity, privately or in ATM offerings, in order to accumulate the intended crypto. Even convertible securities, which come with interest or dividend expenses to the common, are sometimes issued. Both effectively use the equity of the business as a form of leverage to build a treasury position. Cryptos like Worldcoin can be staked to produce yield, effectively creating interest income as well. As these strategies are new, many forming in the wake of the GENIUS Act, other ways to create value haven't yet been developed, and the general investment thesis for their stocks is that the crypto portfolio should appreciate, benefiting shareholders indirectly. Valuation Given these things, there's a lot of speculation baked into this. Eightco isn't a business with much cash flow at all, and almost everything in the valuation after the announcement reflects the treasury strategy. Worldcoin Price on September 8, 2025 (Coinbase) The price chart above shows how Worldcoin climbed in price throughout the day and continued to do so after market hours closed. This is before the bulk of the offering is even raised and therefore does not reflect the buying activity of Eightco yet. Trading Data (Coinbase) If we look at the trading data from Coinbase on this, Worldcoin's market cap rose to $3.6B as a result, with nearly that value in volume from the past 24 hours, which accounted for 18% of the volume in the last 30 days. That's a lot for the first day of the treasury strategy. As $250M remains yet to be raised and committed to this goal, that's about 8% of the market cap unspent that can create buying pressure. There's reason to think that upside exists, and one might make a Buy thesis on this basis alone. Similarly, OCTO's market cap closed Sept. 8 under $140M, short of the $250M in assets it should soon have. BMNR 6M Price History (Seeking Alpha) If we look to BMNR again as an example, there was a quick pop in July when they also announced their change to ETH treasury, from about $4.50 to a high of $135 in the first few days. It cratered shortly thereafter, and recent increases reflect action after further capital raises. SUIG 6M Price History (Seeking Alpha) SUI Group ( SUIG ) also saw a sudden pop and has zig-zagged as more fundraising and treasury accumulation occurred. There's a pattern to some of this. I think folks interested in OCTO need to take this into account. For the foreseeable future, I think there will likely be ebbs and flows, with sharp jumps that follow new stock offerings, followed by an easing as buying action for the underlying crypto slows down. Conclusion Peter Thiel wrote about the difference in returns between 0 to 1 and 1 to X, the former being the more vertical of the two, even if X is a great return like 1 to 5. For OCTO, the 0 to 1 moment has already passed, and we are in a highly uncertain 1 to X phase. I'll remind folks that X can be a smaller number than 1, too. Crypto treasury companies are a novelty of 2025, and much remains to be seen about how well they will fare and if their existence will ultimately provide value to shareholders or the related blockchain networks. While buying activity may drive the stock up more, it's good to be cautious.

Justin Sun’s $USDD just landed on the Ethereum network, and it’s not just a casual visit. It’s a strategic move to challenge Tether, the reigning champ of the $2.5T stablecoin market. $USDD is coming in hot with a Peg Stability module that lets you swap it directly for $USDT and $USDC. And to get the party started, there’s an airdrop campaign offering an up to 12% annual yield . That’s what you call a welcome gift! Still, $USDD has its work cut out for it. Tether’s dominance is massive, with a market cap of over $169B compared to $USDD’s modest $450M. Tether is deeply rooted and has incredible liquidity, especially on TRON. For $USDD to really compete, it needs to earn trust, diversify its collateral, and get integrated into more real-world uses. It could take a page out of Best Wallet’s book, which, along with its native Best Wallet Token ($BEST) , brings crypto investing and dApps to the masses. The Yield-Bearing Revolution: A Fresh Business Model for L2s While $USDD is making its big move, another shift is happening behind the scenes. Ethereum’s Layer-2 (L2) solutions are finding new ways to make money. MegaETH, an L2 backed by Vitalik Buterin himself, is launching a yield-bearing stablecoin called $USDm . Instead of relying on transaction fees, MegaETH plans to use the yield from USDm’s reserves to cover its own costs , specifically the fees it pays to the main Ethereum chain. This clever approach could mean lower fees for users and more freedom for dApp developers. The stablecoin’s reserves will be invested in BlackRock’s tokenized US Treasury fund, providing a steady income. This is happening as more yield-bearing stablecoins emerge, especially after the US’s GENIUS Act pushes protocols like Ethena and MegaETH to innovate. It’s a sign that L2s aren’t just about speed; they’re also figuring out how to be more efficient and economical. It’s another thing they could learn from Best Wallet Token ($BEST) , which provides its holders with everything they need to participate in the crypto economy, in one easy-to-use app. $BEST Is Your Best Bet While the battle of high yields rages between Tether and $USDD, what if a single token could help you navigate the entire crypto landscape? Cue Best Wallet Token ($BEST) . While $USDD is just one player in the stablecoin game, $BEST is your all-access pass to the entire digital asset show. It’s something investors are clearly responding to, as the presale has raised over $15.6M so far. Instead of chasing the next asset, you can hold $BEST and get benefits that work across the board. You get reduced transaction and swap fees on multiple blockchains, saving you money no matter which token you’re trading. Plus, $BEST holders get exclusive access to the ‘Upcoming Tokens’ section, meaning you can get in early on the next big crypto projects before they go public. That’s a massive advantage in a market that moves at lightning speed. Get your $BEST now for $0.025615 , or find step-by-step instructions in our ‘How to Buy Best Wallet Token’ guide. More Than A Wallet, It’s a Secure Financial Hub With new L2s like MegaETh boasting ever-improved business models, it’s clear that crypto is constantly evolving, and you need a platform that can keep up. This is where Best Wallet shines. It’s built with Fireblocks MPC-CMP technology , meaning you can forget about the stress of managing complicated seed phrases. It’s a secure, non-custodial wallet that makes your crypto safe and easy to access. But the best part? It turns your assets into a source of passive income. Beyond fee reductions and presale access, holding $BEST allows you to earn rewards through staking (currently sitting at a respectable 85%). This means your tokens are working for you, generating value while you hold them. The upcoming Best Card will even let you spend your crypto in the real world and get cashback rewards. So while other projects are focusing on one specific problem, $BEST is building a complete, user-friendly ecosystem. It’s this focus on the future that leads us to believe it could reach $0.072 by the end of 2025, resulting in a massive 181% ROI on today’s price. A Central Hub in the Innovation Storm While $USDD is locked in a high-stakes battle for stablecoin supremacy and MegaETH is pioneering new L2 business models, Best Wallet Token ($BEST) brings everything together for you, the user. J oin the presale now and be ready to ride the next wave of crypto innovation. Remember to always do your own research and only invest what you can afford. This is not intended as financial advice.

On Monday, ARK bought 101,950 shares valued at approximately $4.4 million, distributed across three of its funds: the Ark Innovation ETF, which now holds a 2.6% allocation, the Ark Next Generation Internet ETF, and the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF, both with similar stakes. Combined, the three ARK funds now hold 6.7 million BitMine shares worth around $284 million, according to fund filings. This move continues a pattern of growing exposure to BitMine, which began in April when the firm ramped up its accumulation of Ether as a treasury asset. Following the announcement, BitMine shares surged 4.1%, closing at $44.10 in after-hours trading. Over the course of the year, its stock has soared by an impressive 460%. BitMine Breaks Records with 2M ETH Holdings The ARK investment coincided with BitMine reaching a major milestone: surpassing 2 million ETH , valued at about $8.9 billion. This represents 1.7% of the total Ether supply, making BitMine the largest corporate holder of Ether, controlling 42% of all ETH collected by corporations to date. Despite this rapid accumulation, BitMine is only 34% toward its goal of holding 5% of Ether’s supply, signaling further buying potential. “We continue to believe Ethereum is one of the biggest macro trades over the next 10–15 years,” Tom Lee stated, reaffirming his bullish outlook. Meanwhile, Ether’s price has remained stagnant this month, trading within a narrow range, though sentiment around its long-term potential remains strong. Fed Rate Cuts and What’s Next for Crypto? In addition to his Ether enthusiasm, Lee is optimistic about the Federal Reserve’s upcoming interest rate decision . Speaking to CNBC, he said a cut in rates would lower borrowing costs, especially for mortgages, and enhance business confidence. Futures markets currently reflect an 89.4% probability of a 25 basis point cut, with a smaller chance of a 50 basis point reduction. Lee’s outlook ties macroeconomic trends to crypto’s continued growth, reinforcing confidence in both Ether and broader markets.

The best crypto presale to buy right now often combines entertainment, culture, and utility. Based Eggman $GGs is one of the new crypto token presales gaining traction, particularly among DOGE and XRP holders who recognize the importance of meme energy mixed with real-world applications. Alongside $GGs, established tokens like Dogecoin and Ripple’s XRP remain part of many crypto presale lists and investment discussions. Together, they show how presale crypto tokens and established coins shape different sides of the digital asset market. What is Based Eggman ($GGs)? It is the meme token that powers the Based Eggman ecosystem , designed to bring gaming, streaming, and trading into one Web3 hub. Unlike many token presales, $GGs is linked to activities such as gaming competitions, tipping, and liquidity pools, making it an interactive asset rather than just a presale coin. In the world of online gaming, “GGs” is a universal phrase for “Good Games,” expressing recognition and respect. This cultural connection adds depth to its use as a pre sale cryptocurrency. Within the Based Eggman platform, $GGs presale crypto tokens can be used for payments, minting, and even gas fees for smart contracts. The project places itself among the top crypto presales by creating a social-gaming experience on Base, with expansion planned across Ethereum, BSC, and Solana. This approach makes Based Eggman a standout in the crypto ICO presale space while appealing to DOGE and XRP communities looking for new crypto presale opportunities in 2025. Dogecoin (DOGE): Current Price and Recent Performance Dogecoin continues to maintain its identity as the original meme coin while holding strong market interest. The current price trades around $0.22 to $0.23, reflecting a 5% increase in the past 24 hours. This upward move follows weeks of sideways consolidation, showing that DOGE can still capture momentum when broader market sentiment improves. Over the last 60 days, it has gained nearly 27%, proving resilience despite not returning to its 2021 all-time high of $0.73. For those following crypto coins on presale and established players alike, DOGE offers an example of how meme-driven tokens can retain cultural influence while riding broader market cycles. XRP: Holding Ground After a Volatile Summer XRP is currently consolidating after a sharp rally earlier in the summer. Its price has declined from a July peak of $3.66 but remains supported by important legal and market developments. The resolution of Ripple’s long-running SEC lawsuit has cleared a path for broader adoption and restored confidence among many traders. In addition, speculation around a possible spot XRP exchange-traded fund has created ongoing discussion about its future role in mainstream finance. For those balancing cryptocurrency presales and long-established coins, XRP illustrates how external factors like regulation and institutional interest can shape market performance. It remains a key asset on many crypto lists and investment strategies in 2025.

After weeks of consolidation and gradual upward momentum, this breakthrough is being hailed as a pivotal turning point that could reshape market sentiment around the digital asset. Technical indicators underscore the breakout’s strength: surging volume confirms heavy participation, RSI stays bullish without signs of exhaustion, and analysts flag $3 as a pivotal level where resistance may flip to support, potentially triggering a short squeeze toward $3.18. Notably, market psychology plays an equally important role. Round numbers like $3 often serve as mental anchors for traders, shaping perception and influencing decision-making. Therefore, a reclaim of such a level doesn’t just alter technical setups, it sparks renewed optimism, attracting sidelined investors and reigniting media coverage, which in turn amplifies momentum. At the time of this writing, XRP was up by 2.1% in the past 24 hours to trade at $3.01, according to CoinGecko data . Apple Rumored to Announce $1.5B XRP Purchase, Says Analyst John Squire According to market analyst John Squire, strong rumors are circulating that Apple may announce a massive $1.5 billion purchase of XRP today. If confirmed, this would mark one of the most significant corporate cryptocurrency acquisitions to date, potentially reshaping both Apple’s financial strategy and the broader digital asset landscape. Apple has historically taken a cautious approach to cryptocurrency, focusing primarily on enabling payments through Apple Pay and supporting limited crypto-related features on its platforms. A direct purchase of XRP, however, would signal a bold shift. XRP’s utility in cross-border settlements and real-time payments aligns with Apple’s long-standing emphasis on seamless, frictionless financial technology. By integrating XRP into its ecosystem, or even holding it as a reserve asset, Apple could strengthen its positioning in the digital payments sector. The rumored $1.5 billion figure is particularly noteworthy. Such a purchase would not only boost Apple’s exposure to blockchain but also serve as a signal of corporate confidence in XRP at a time when institutional adoption is accelerating. Analysts suggest the move could spark renewed interest among other tech giants, potentially triggering a wave of corporate digital asset acquisitions. Conclusion If the rumor proves true, Apple’s announcement could drive XRP’s price sharply higher, attract institutional inflows, and further legitimize crypto in mainstream finance. Meanwhile, XRP reclaiming the $3 milestone represents more than just a price point, it is a statement of resilience. For many, it marks the beginning of a new chapter where XRP seeks not only to revisit its past glory but also to surpass it in the evolving crypto landscape.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-09 11:42:05

Buyers have taken the lead again following a recovery observed yesterday, as resistance appeared around $9.82. This situation also indicates that selling pressure is high around the $10 level, as the coin has faced multiple rejections at that price point. Uniswap price analysis on the daily time frame The one-day price chart of Uniswap coin confirmed a bullish trend in the market. The UNI/USD value has jumped to an intraday high of $9.79. Green candlesticks on the price chart signify returning buying interest and a continuation of an uptrend. The distance between the Bollinger bands defines the volatility.

The coin has been struggling to maintain its price at $9.40, but it seems to be poised for a further increase in the coming hours.

Uniswap price analysis gives a bullish prediction regarding the ongoing market trends, as the coin’s price is increasing after a continued bullish wave observed over the current trading session. If buyers hold the ongoing momentum, UNI’s price might spike above the $10 range. Is Uniswap a good investment? Uniswap is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX) with massive potential. Unlike traditional exchanges, Uniswap uses an automated market-matching (AMM) system. Uniswap has shown good performance over time and is expected to reach the $36.22 level by 2027 and above $74.36 by 2031. Why is UNI up? The broader crypto market is experiencing a bullish phase today. Most of the top cryptocurrencies are gaining value, and so is UNI. As buyers gained ground around $9.4, positive sentiment returned to the market. How much will Uniswap be worth in 2025? The maximum UNI can reach in 2025 is $17.16, while the average price is expected to be around $14.30. Will UNI reach $20? Uniswap is trading just above the $9 range, down from $18.59, which it achieved in December last year. The current resistance levels are $10 and $10.7; a break above them can lead to $11. If UNI gets more support, $20 can be achieved by the year 2026. Will UNI reach $50? In May 2021, UNI touched $44.9, its all-time high and not much below $50. This possibility can arise again if the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish on political and economic factors. Can Uniswap reach $100 dollars? According to the Uniswap price prediction, UNI is not expected to reach near $100 by the last quarter of 2031. Though this is a five-year time frame, it’s worth waiting, as the coin’s value will increase but may not reach $100. Does UNI have a good long-term Future? UNI is the token of the famous Uniswap decentralized exchange. It has a wide user base and good liquidity, so the coin has good prospects. Market analysts expect UNI’s price to reach $74.36 by the end of 2031, substantially higher than its current price.

In older systems like Uniswap V2, an LP’s funds were spread evenly across a price range from zero to infinity. This was inefficient because most trading happens within a very small price range. To solve this, Uniswap V3 introduced concentrated liquidity. This feature allows LPs to choose a specific, or “custom,” price range on a chart where they want to provide their liquidity.

Instead of fueling growth and innovation, this cash is parked on the sidelines, showing deep uncertainty about the economy, Washington’s debt policies, and the Fed’s next move. The irony is that this so-called “dry powder” is both a shield and a weapon. As long as interest rates stay high, investors are content to sit tight. But the moment the Fed hints at easing , this money won’t move slowly—it could rush into risk assets, igniting a powerful market melt-up. Until then, the sidelines remain more crowded than ever. When that rotation finally happens, the shift could be violent—either a historic surge or a panicked scramble. $7.4 trillion isn’t idle cash; it’s pressure building up, waiting for release.

XRP is holding steady in the payments space, and Hedera continues to build its enterprise presence, but the real buzz surrounds Remittix (RTX) . This PayFi altcoin has already raised over $24.5 million and is being tipped for explosive growth. These three tokens are among the most compelling assets to own right now. XRP: Stability With Room to Climb XRP is trading at about $2.94, consolidating at about $3.00, slightly below resistance. While support at $2.70 continues to be the crucial floor, analysts predict that a breakout over that level might push the token toward $3.70. Due to its use in cross-border payments, XRP continues to attract the interest of institutional actors. Although there is more uncertainty due to Ripple’s continuous regulatory disputes, traders continue to keep an eye on the network due to its resiliency. For those seeking stability with steady upside potential, XRP remains a cornerstone holding. Hedera: Enterprise Adoption on the Rise Hedera (HBAR) is priced near $0.22. It is backed by its innovative hashgraph consensus and a governance model led by global corporations. Adoption continues to grow as Hedera integrates into supply chain solutions, tokenisation, and other enterprise-grade use cases. The HBAR price predictions for 2025 remain conservative. Experts project HBAR to hit anywhere between $0.24–$0.27 in the short term. Longer-term goals predict a surge to $1 by 2030. While not a token for quick multiples, Hedera offers measured growth for investors looking for stability. Remittix: The Breakout Candidate The conversation around the best crypto to buy today keeps returning to Remittix (RTX) . With its presale now surpassing $24.5M and more than 651 million tokens sold, RTX is shaping up as the most exciting altcoin of 2025. Here’s why investors are piling in: $24.5M+ raised during presale Confirmed listings on BitMart and LBank, The Remittix Beta wallet launches on September 15, 2025 CertiK audit adds confidence in security and sustainability. A $250,000 giveaway campaign expanding its reach and accelerating early adoption. By targeting the $19 trillion remittance industry, Remittix (RTX) is positioning itself as a challenger to XRP and traditional banking systems. Its blend of adoption-focused utility and strong investor momentum makes it one of the clearest breakout candidates of the year. Three Tokens Worth Owning For investors weighing the best crypto to buy today, XRP offers stability, Hedera provides enterprise credibility, and Remittix stands out with explosive potential. Each has its strengths, but Remittix is grabbing the spotlight thanks to its presale success, upcoming wallet launch, and global payments use case.

Get ready, crypto enthusiasts! Binance, the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange, has just dropped an exciting announcement that could significantly impact your trading strategies. Starting today, you can delve into USDE margin trading with new pairs, opening up fresh avenues for market participation and potential gains. This move signals Binance’s continued commitment to expanding its offerings and catering to the diverse needs of its global user base. What is USDE Margin Trading and Why is it Significant? Before we dive into the specifics of Binance’s announcement, let’s quickly understand what USDE margin trading entails. USDE, or Ethena’s USDe, is a synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum, designed to provide a censorship-resistant, scalable, and stable digital asset. Unlike traditional stablecoins backed by fiat reserves, USDE maintains its peg through delta-hedging strategies involving staked Ethereum and corresponding short perpetual futures positions. Margin trading, in essence, allows traders to borrow funds to increase their exposure to an asset, amplifying potential profits (and losses). When you combine this with a stable asset like USDE, it opens up unique strategies, especially for those looking to capitalize on funding rates or maintain stablecoin exposure with leverage. Binance’s Latest Move: Diving into USDE Margin Trading Pairs Binance officially announced on its website that it will introduce USDE/USDT and USDE/USDC cross and isolated margin trading pairs. This significant update goes live today, at 12:00 p.m. UTC. For traders, this means more flexibility and new options to engage with the market. USDE/USDT: This pair allows you to trade USDE against Tether’s USDT, another popular stablecoin. USDE/USDC: This pair facilitates trading USDE against Circle’s USDC, offering another stablecoin alternative. Both cross and isolated margin modes will be available. Cross margin uses your entire margin balance across all positions, while isolated margin dedicates a specific amount of margin to a single position, helping to limit potential losses to that specific trade. Unlocking Potential: Benefits and Considerations for USDE Margin Trading The addition of USDE margin trading pairs brings several potential benefits. Traders can now: Amplify Stablecoin Strategies: Leverage USDE to potentially enhance returns from yield farming or arbitrage opportunities between stablecoins. Diversify Exposure: Add another stablecoin option to their margin trading portfolio, moving beyond just USDT or USDC. Hedge Positions: Use USDE to hedge against volatility in other crypto assets while maintaining a leveraged stablecoin position. However, it’s crucial to remember that margin trading comes with inherent risks. Leverage can magnify losses just as easily as it can magnify gains. Always understand the liquidation risks associated with both cross and isolated margin modes before entering a trade. How to Get Started with USDE Margin Trading on Binance If you are keen to explore these new USDE margin trading opportunities, here’s a quick guide to get you started: Log In to Binance: Ensure your account is verified and funded. Navigate to Margin Trading: Find the ‘Trade’ section and select ‘Margin’. Select Your Pair: Choose either USDE/USDT or USDE/USDC. Choose Margin Mode: Decide between ‘Cross’ or ‘Isolated’ margin based on your risk tolerance. Fund Your Margin Account: Transfer sufficient funds to your margin wallet. Place Your Order: Execute your buy or sell order, keeping leverage and liquidation prices in mind. Always start with a clear trading plan and consider using stop-loss orders to manage your risk effectively. Educate yourself on the specifics of USDE and the dynamics of margin trading before committing significant capital. Binance’s decision to integrate USDE margin trading pairs marks another step in the evolution of accessible and diverse crypto financial products. This move provides advanced traders with more tools to navigate the dynamic crypto landscape, offering both exciting potential and the need for careful risk management.

The measure, filed on September 5 by Representative David Joyce (R-OH) as part of the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act for FY2026 (H.R. 5166), directs the Treasury to assess the feasibility, security, and accounting of a federal digital asset reserve built primarily from seized cryptocurrencies. The bill has already cleared the House Appropriations Committee, been assigned Union Calendar No. 193, and is awaiting a floor vote. Its ultimate passage, however, will hinge on broader budget negotiations later this year. U.S. Treasury Report to Weigh Feasibility of a Bitcoin Reserve Currently, the federal government holds an estimated 198,000–207,000 BTC (roughly $17–20 billion), mostly acquired through law enforcement actions against darknet markets, fraud schemes, and cybercrime. Historically, these holdings were sold off at public auctions, a practice now shifting toward strategic retention. Under the new framework, however, Treasury would need to assess the practicability of establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve and digital asset stockpile, including potential legal or operational barriers. The bill also calls for clarity on how these assets would be valued on the federal balance sheet, how custody would be managed, and whether outside contractors would be used for safekeeping. Notably, the report must analyze how consolidating seized Bitcoin and other assets into a reserve would affect the Treasury Forfeiture Fund, which currently receives proceeds from asset seizures. National security looms large in the proposal. The legislation directs Treasury and the National Security Agency to jointly prepare a classified security assessment detailing how to protect federal digital asset reserves from cyberattacks, insider threats, and foreign adversaries. It also requires the department to outline its legal authority, cybersecurity measures, and interagency protocols for moving digital assets securely. The timing reflects a broader political push. In March, President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing a framework for a national Bitcoin reserve , explicitly stating that the government would not buy coins on the open market but instead rely on confiscations. The U.S. will not buy Bitcoin for its landmark Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, U.S. Treasury Scott Bessent told Fox News on Thursday. #ScottBessent #BitcoinReserve https://t.co/11my7XYiSq — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 14, 2025 Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has since reinforced the message, arguing that Bitcoin can serve as a hedge and an innovation signal , while taxpayers benefit from retaining high-value assets rather than selling them off prematurely. Supporters of the bill frame it as fiscal pragmatism and geopolitical strategy. Representative Joyce said the measure ensures that the government “remains fiscally responsible, leverages new technology, and is focused on national security.” I am incredibly proud to see @HouseAppropsGOP advance my FY26 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Bill. This legislation ensures the federal government is fiscally responsible, leverages new technology, and is focused on national security. pic.twitter.com/W23xcfCYNB — Dave Joyce (@RepDaveJoyce) September 4, 2025 The legislation also includes a prohibition against funding a U.S. central bank digital currency, showing Republican resistance to a government-backed CBDC. Global Momentum for National Bitcoin Reserves: Governments Now Hold 517,000 BTC Worldwide Adding urgency to the need for proper reserve classification and reporting, some U.S. states advance their own measures. Particularly, Texas has already established a state-level reserve, while other states, including New Hampshire and Arizona , have passed digital asset investment laws. Notably, the United States is not alone in exploring crypto reserves. This week, El Salvador advanced its Bitcoin accumulation with a 21 BTC purchase to celebrate Bitcoin Day despite the IMF directory. Likewise, Kazakhstan’s president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, recently proposed a state crypto fund to accumulate digital assets. El Salvador buys 21 Bitcoin to celebrate its fourth anniversary of the Bitcoin Law, reaching a total of 6,313.18 BTC, valued at $701 million. #ElSalvador #BitcoinOffice #BitcoinTreasury https://t.co/578e4ujv1r — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 8, 2025 In the Philippines, lawmakers have considered a proposal to establish a reserve of 10,000 Bitcoin , which would make it the first in Southeast Asia to adopt such a measure. Similarly, Brazil’s Congress is considering Bill 4501/24, a proposal to create a $19 billion Bitcoin reserve , known as RESBit, under the joint oversight of the Central Bank and Finance Ministry. The Philippines introduced the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act, proposing a 10,000 BTC acquisition via @BangkoSentral over five years. #Bitcoin #Philippines https://t.co/RJh07Jhnp2 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 22, 2025 Notably, Bitbo data reveals that governments worldwide hold more than 517,000 Bitcoin, equal to 2.46% of the total supply.

51444896,577384,1757419138,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51444896.jpeg,Whales Rush In As Bitcoin Hyper’s $14.6M Presale Becomes $BTC’s Ticket to Mainstream Success,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hyper-to-fix-btc-as-whales-rush-to-presale/,"Bitcoin Hyper’s $14.6M+ presale could be Bitcoin’s ticket to mainstream success once the project releases and implements its long-awaited changes. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is set to be Bitcoin’s official Layer-2, and plans to free Bitcoin from its performance limitation of just seven transactions per second (TPS). Little wonder, then, that whales have been sniffing around the $HYPER presale – this month has already seen a solid $50K whale buy. Hyper’s goal is to make transactions faster and cheaper within the Bitcoin ecosystem, turning the network into a more viable choice for institutional investors. This includes high-traffic payment processors like Visa, which has a throughput of up to 65K TPS . But what exactly are Bitcoin’s problems? Why The Bitcoin Network Is Inefficient And Sluggish Bitcoin’s primary problem is the performance limitation, currently capped at seven TPS. This means that the network can only process seven transactions per second before experiencing increased confirmation times and congestion. Because of the low throughput, transactions fall into a queue list, with the system prioritizing larger transactions with higher fees. This fee-based priority system increases the confirmation time to potentially multiple hours. In all, it means Bitcoin can be slow, expensive, and overall ineffective, with the network often experiencing congestion during high-traffic periods. In terms of performance, Bitcoin ranks 22nd on the list of the fastest blockchains . Even Ethereum – with a utilization rate that has dropped to 50.68% , below the long-term average of 56.81% – still ranks 18th. Solana, on the other hand, is second to ICP only, with a real throughput of 1K TPS and a theoretical max of 65K . So, Bitcoin clearly needs to step up its game. However, Bitcoin Hyper isn’t the first attempt at fixing the problem. How the Lightning Network Failed The Lightning Network is the most well-known failed attempt at boosting Bitcoin’s performance past its native limitations. The idea was similar to what Bitcoin Hyper is offering: faster and cheaper transactions without impacting the network’s security. Unfortunately, the Lightning Network fell short due to its poor implementation and lack of relevant upgrades. The network came with multiple problems , including routing and path-finding failures, channel backup and recovery failure, and integration problems. But the most impactful one related to the security aspect, as Lightning Network’s nodes need to remain online at all times to keep transactions flowing. This led to the Fraudulent Channel Close scam , causing people to lose their funds to a system exploit. To prevent that, the devs created Watchtowers with the goal of addressing this specific problem. But the damage had already been done and investors lost their trust. However, it’s not all doom and gloom. Bitcoin Hyper’s Layer-2 is poised to take over and eliminate Bitcoin’s pain points. If it’s successful, $HYPER could become Bitcoin’s saving grace. How Bitcoin Hyper Solves Bitcoin’s Issues Bitcoin Hyper relies on several tools – like the Canonical Bridge and the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) – to address Bitcoin’s core performance limitations. The Canonical Bridge will connect the Bitcoin network to the Hyper layer and relies on the Bitcoin Relay Program (BRP) to confirm incoming transactions. This drops confirmation times from hours to mere seconds, hitting multiple birds with one stone. The fee-based priority system will also be gone, network fees will go down, and there’ll be no more risk of congestion. Once the BRP confirms the transactions’ details, the Canonical Bridge will mint your $BTC onto the Hyper Layer-2 as wrapped $BTC. There, you can swap, stake, buy NFTs, and interact with dApps and DeFi. And at any time, you can withdraw your wrapped $BTC back to Bitcoin’s native Layer-1. The SVM, meanwhile, complements the system by enabling the ultra-fast execution of smart contracts and turning Bitcoin even faster and more performant than ever. The SVM allows for higher throughput and scalability, bringing Solana’s performance into Bitcoin’s highly secure and reputable ecosystem. Hyper’s Presale Performance Bouyed By Whales The $HYPER presale has now reached $14.6M+, and with no signs of slowing. In addition to last week’s $50K whale buy, August also saw some significant whale activity, including $161.3K and $100.6K . And as we head deeper into this month, there’s a good chance more whales will be circling the $HYPER presale. With a current token price of $0.012885 – and staking at 75% APY – it’s growing at an accelerated pace. The influx of investors is the result of the project’s long-term potential, extensive and transparent roadmap, and the hype behind the idea of a faster and cheaper Bitcoin network. Based on these factors, there’s a good chance that $HYPER will see a post-launch boom, followed by a steady long-term performance. By the end of the year, our price prediction for $HYPER puts the token at $0.32. By 2030, $HYPER could reach $1.50 or higher, especially if Bitcoin sees mainstream adoption. This reflects an ROI of 11,541%, which is enough to incentivize early adopters while the token still trades at its presale price. Ready to jump in? Visit the official Bitcoin Hyper presale today. Should You Buy Into the Hyper Hype? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) promises to fix Bitcoin’s pain points and overtake the Lightning Network as Bitcoin’s primary Layer-2 solution, so it’s not surprising that whales are rushing in. As to whether you should invest or not – this depends on your risk tolerance and vision. But if you do decide to invest, you should do it now while the $HYPER price is still low, which could change fast post-launch. So, read our guide on how to buy $HYPER and then to the official presale page to secure your tokens. This isn’t financial advice. Always do your own research and invest wisely.

Fees go up, transactions backlog, and users seek out cheaper lanes That’s where Layer 2s come in. They leverage Ethereum’s security while shifting activity off-chain or into efficient rollups, resulting in a faster and cheaper user experience. In 2025, these networks are not just valuable tools – they’re the growth engines behind the wave of adoption. Layer 2s are now becoming the default onramp to DeFi, gaming and payments for investors. Reduced fees open up smaller wallets but increased finality will pave the way for richer on-chain applications. From an investment perspective, this is the sweet spot: solid utility, increasing usage, and an obvious connection to Ethereum’s long-term roadmap. Investors are also looking for early-stage plays that are riding the same wave of adoption. One new name that is often mentioned in this context is MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is considered by some to be a complementary role as emerging ecosystems that benefit from early participation and patient holding. Why Layer 2s Keep Winning Arbitrum, Optimism, Base and zk-powered chains are transforming day-to-day activity into long-term network effects. As more apps are deployed and more users bridge in, the audience for developers continues to grow and liquidity increases. That feedback loop causes TVL and transactions to trend higher over time – one of the key signals when investing for 2025 and beyond. The Developer Advantage Layer 2s make it easier for teams to ship. Rollup frameworks, dev tooling, and funding grants reduce build cycles. This is important for investors: networks where new products can launch quickly and find users without price gouging through high gas fees. Scarcity Meets Demand As the current presale cycle comes to a close, the tightening allocation of tokens in light of increasing demand ahead of various public catalysts has brought attention towards the schedule and structure of MAGACOIN FINANCE. The thesis is simple: if the float remains lean and community growth and listings continue to advance, price discovery can accelerate. This combination of tightening supply and rising interest is the reason why some investors are considering an allocation as a higher-risk satellite to their Layer 2 core. And with its rapid growth rate, MAGACOIN FINANCE is set to be one of the standouts in 2025. The Long Game With Ethereum Scaling Even if market sentiment cools at times, Layer 2 adoption tends to surge upward. Wallet counts, bridge flows, and app launches rarely go backwards for long. For long-range investors, that compounding of real usage is the north star. Conclusion Layer 2s solve real problems for Ethereum users and developers, and their traction is visible in everyday activity. For portfolios planning past 2025, these networks look like foundational holdings. And for those building an “early-stage” sleeve, names like MAGACOIN FINANCE offer optionality tied to scarcity and upcoming catalysts.

The Numbers Don’t Lie Over the past 12 months: XDC surged by roughly 206% , climbing from under $0.03 to nearly $0.08, as various RWA worth billions came on XDC, accelerating the ecosystem’s growth. Bitcoin gained around 109% , doubling in value as spot ETFs and macro trends renewed institutional interest. Ethereum advanced approximately 93% , buoyed by ETF approvals and steady adoption across DeFi and NFTs. This performance positions XDC as one of the most overlooked winners of the year, quietly surpassing the returns of crypto’s two largest players. Why Did XDC Outperform? Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are entrenched as digital gold and decentralized finance infrastructure, respectively, XDC has carved a niche in the real-world assets (RWA) and trade finance sector . Enterprise Adoption : XDC is designed for tokenizing real-world assets, enabling faster settlements and streamlining global trade, areas with trillion-dollar potential. Cost Efficiency : With near-zero gas fees and energy-efficient consensus, it provides an attractive alternative to Ethereum’s high transaction costs. Native USDC + CCTP V2 coming to XDC : On Aug. 26, 2025 , Circle announced that USDC and CCTP V2 are coming to the XDC Network , providing a regulated, on-chain dollar for RWA, trade, and DeFi flows on XDC. U.S. Access Expanded: Kraken & Binance. US. Kraken listed XDC on September 2, 2025, and Binance.US lists XDC (XDC/USDT), providing U.S. users with straightforward, regulated access to buy and trade XDC. XDC operates on Delegated Proof-of-Stake (XDPoS), which the project documents as being orders of magnitude less energy-intensive than proof-of-work networks, with seconds-level finality and negligible fees. These attributes align with ESG-screened mandates and large institutions seeking to reduce the environmental footprint of on-chain activity. 21Shares launched an XDC ETP on the SIX Swiss Exchange in August 2025, now managing over $30 million in assets under management (AUM) . This move opened regulated institutional exposure to XDC and bolstered its legitimacy. Long-Term Analysis & Bull Case Some analysts envision a 12x rally if the broader crypto bull cycle returns, leveraging XDC’s hybrid architecture, enterprise focus, and regulatory alignment as key growth levers. This blend of utility and strategic positioning in a growing market segment has fueled XDC’s price momentum. BTC and ETH Still Dominate Headlines Despite XDC’s standout growth, Bitcoin and Ethereum remain the undisputed anchors of the digital asset ecosystem. Bitcoin’s ETF milestone has legitimized its role as a macro hedge for institutions. Ethereum’s roadmap toward scaling (Danksharding, Layer-2 growth) reinforces its dominance in decentralized applications. Yet, these well-established giants saw lower relative returns than XDC, underscoring how smaller networks can sometimes deliver outsized gains. The Investor Angle For investors, the lesson is clear: while Bitcoin and Ethereum remain essential for stability and liquidity, emerging layer-1 networks like XDC can deliver asymmetric upside , particularly when backed by real-world adoption. Analysts suggest that XDC’s performance may not be an isolated event but rather the start of broader recognition for blockchain projects focused on enterprise-grade solutions. As of today, XDC trades at around $0.079–$0.080 and is available on major venues, including Kraken, Binance US, KuCoin, Bybit, Gate.io, MEXC, Bitget, HTX, Bitrue, and many more . The past year has reminded investors that crypto is more than just Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Imagine a future where top overseas crypto exchanges can operate legally within the United States, offering more choices and robust protection for American users. This exciting prospect is now on the table, thanks to recent considerations by U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Acting Chair Caroline Pham. A Pivotal Shift for Overseas Crypto Exchanges in the US? During a recent speech, CFTC Acting Chair Caroline Pham revealed she is actively considering a plan that would allow overseas crypto exchanges to offer their services in the United States. This is a strategic move aimed at integrating global players under a structured regulatory umbrella. The proposal hinges on these exchanges adhering to stringent regulations, much like Europe’s landmark Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. Eleanor Terrett, host of Crypto in America, reported this significant statement, sparking widespread discussion. This consideration builds upon earlier signals from the CFTC. The commission had previously announced its intention to release specific guidance for the registration of overseas exchanges. This guidance would pave the way for their legal operation, potentially reshaping the competitive landscape and regulatory approach to digital assets. What Does This Mean for the US Crypto Landscape? The potential entry of regulated overseas crypto exchanges could bring several benefits to the US market. For consumers, it means more choice, potentially better liquidity, and access to a wider range of digital assets and services. For the market, it could foster greater innovation and attract more institutional capital, solidifying the US position in the global crypto economy. Moreover, embracing MiCA-like regulations could establish a clearer, more predictable environment. This clarity is something the US crypto industry has long sought, moving away from a fragmented and often uncertain regulatory patchwork. It could also enhance investor protection by mandating robust operational standards and transparency. Navigating the Regulatory Waters: MiCA as a Blueprint Europe’s MiCA framework is globally recognized for its comprehensive approach to regulating crypto assets. It covers everything from consumer protection and market integrity to environmental impact and anti-money laundering (AML) measures. By suggesting a similar regulatory standard for overseas crypto exchanges entering the US, the CFTC aims to ensure a high level of compliance and security. However, adopting such a framework isn’t without its challenges. Integrating international regulations with existing US laws will require careful consideration. Issues like jurisdictional overlap, enforcement, and compliance costs for these exchanges will need thorough addressing to ensure a smooth transition and effective oversight. The Road Ahead for Overseas Crypto Exchanges The CFTC’s proactive stance indicates a serious commitment to developing a robust regulatory framework for digital assets. The upcoming guidance on the registration of overseas crypto exchanges will be crucial. It will likely detail specific requirements, application processes, and ongoing compliance obligations for legal operation in the US. For crypto businesses operating internationally, this signals an opportunity to prepare for potential expansion into the lucrative US market. For users, it promises a more mature and regulated ecosystem. Staying informed about these developments will be key as the CFTC continues to shape the future of crypto regulation. In conclusion, the CFTC’s consideration of allowing regulated overseas crypto exchanges into the US marks a significant moment for the digital asset industry. It reflects a growing recognition of crypto’s global nature and the need for harmonized, robust regulatory standards. This move could unlock new opportunities, enhance market integrity, and provide greater security for participants, ultimately paving the way for a more integrated and mature global crypto market.

51445427,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=803651,1757419212,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51445427.jpeg,Court hands 4-year sentence to mastermind of $37M crypto money laundering scheme,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/doj-sentences-man-to-51-months-for-37m-scam/,"The United States Justice Department (DOJ) sentenced the California man to more than four years in prison for participating in a global crypto scam where victims counted over $30 million in losses. 39-year-old Shengsheng He of La Puente was handed a 51-month prison sentence in the Central District of California on Monday. He previously pleaded guilty on April 10 to conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business that laundered $36.9 million to crypto. Along with prison time, the court ordered He to pay more than $26.8 million in restitution to victims of the scheme. DOJ finds He guilty for crypto money scam business According to a statement from the US DOJ, He was among the masterminds in a network that targeted US investors through fraudulent digital asset investments. “The defendant was part of a group of co-conspirators that preyed on American investors by promising them high returns on supposed digital asset investments when, in fact, they stole nearly $37 million from US victims using Cambodian scam centers,” Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew R. Galeotti of the DOJ’s Criminal Division told reporters. Galeotti also mentioned that scam centers operating overseas, especially those presenting themselves as investment opportunities, have grown significantly in recent years. “The Criminal Division is committed to bringing to justice those that steal from American investors, wherever the fraudsters may be located,” he remarked. Per the court documents shared to the media on Monday, the conspiracy involved several co-conspirators based in the US and abroad, using centers in Cambodia. The group contacted American victims through social media messages, phone calls, text messages, and even online dating services. The scammers first gained the crypto holders’ trust, then persuaded them to invest in “profitable crypto ventures.” Victims were told their investments were growing in value, but the funds had already been siphoned away. More than $36.9 million was funneled from US bank accounts into a single account at Deltec Bank in the Bahamas, registered under Axis Digital Limited. He co-founded Axis Digital with another defendant, Jose Somarriba, while Chinese national Jingliang Su later joined as a director. Victims’ funds were deposited in Daltec, then converted into the Tether stablecoin ( USDT ). Prosecutors claimed He and others had instructed the bank to transfer the digital assets to wallets controlled by accomplices in Cambodia. From there, scam center operators in cities like Sihanoukville received the crypto, which was then passed along to “executives” of the scheme. According to the DOJ statement, eight co-conspirators named in the case had already admitted guilt in connection with the operation. The money launderers’ list included Daren Li, a citizen of China and St. Kitts and Nevis, who has been in US custody since April 2024, and Lu Zhang, another illegal US immigrant, who told prosecutors he managed domestic money launderers. US Attorney: Beware of public of online scams Acting US Attorney Bill Essayli of the Central District of California said He’s sentencing is a warning to the demographic trying to use digital assets to launder stolen money. “This defendant will spend years in federal prison for participating in a conspiracy in which victims lost tens of millions of dollars, starting with the simple step of responding to unsolicited messages on their phones,” Essayli said. He told Americans to counter-check strangers promoting investment opportunities online. “Your retirement fund or children’s college money may depend on it,” he added. Assistant US Attorneys Maxwell Coll and Alexander Gorin of the Terrorism and Export Crimes Section, Nisha Chandran of the Major Frauds Section, and Trial Attorney Stefanie Schwartz of the DOJ’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) led the prosecution, alongside Tamara Livshiz of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section.

51444981,577174,1757419222,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51444981.jpeg,$68 Million Dogecoin Treasury Push: CleanCore Aims For 1 Billion In 30 Days,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-treasury-cleancore-1-billion-30-days/,"CleanCore Solutions (NYSE American: ZONE) has purchased 285,420,000 dogecoin—about $68 million at current prices—launching what it calls the “Official Dogecoin Treasury” backed by the Dogecoin Foundation’s corporate arm, House of Doge. The company set an initial accumulation target of 1 billion DOGE within 30 days and reiterated a longer-term objective to secure 5% of the circulating supply. CleanCore Kicks Off Dogecoin Treasury Accumulation In its announcement on Monday, CleanCore said the new treasury “has achieved the status of becoming the single largest DOGE digital asset treasury (DAT) in just under a week,” and framed the program as a utility-driven accumulation strategy tied to upcoming House of Doge initiatives in payments, tokenization, “staking-like” products and remittances. Marco Margiotta—CleanCore’s chief investment officer and CEO of House of Doge—said the aim is to capture “the value of Dogecoin’s ability to serve as the people’s currency,” aligning treasury operations with a push for broader real-world adoption. “Our treasury strategy is aligned with the forward-looking vision of House of Doge, where increased utility is expected to translate into broader adoption,” Margiotta added. Adams stated that the program provides “regulated, transparent exposure to DOGE” for public-market investors. The 1-billion-DOGE near-term goal equates to roughly 0.66% of supply, and the longer-term 5% objective implies ~7.54 billion DOGE, based on recent circulating-supply estimates near 150.86 billion. At a spot price around $0.236–$0.24, the 30-day target would be notionally valued at ~$237–$240 million. Monday’s buy follows CleanCore’s $175,000,420 PIPE financing that closed earlier the same day, which the company said would fund its DOGE treasury, make DOGE its primary reserve asset, and provide working capital. The deal’s investor roster included Pantera , GSR, FalconX, Borderless, MOZAYYX and Mythos, according to the release. The company also said the NYSE American had cleared its supplemental listing application for the transaction. “ZONE is proud to be the first publicly traded company with an official Dogecoin Treasury, sponsored by the Dogecoin Foundation and House of Doge,” CEO Clayton Adams said. The House of Doge relationship is central to the structure. In a separate announcement last week, House of Doge—described in the notices as the Dogecoin Foundation’s “official corporate arm”—said it partnered with CleanCore to create the only Dogecoin treasury “sponsored by the Dogecoin Foundation,” and that 21Shares would support and advise on allocation, yield opportunities and governance. The statement also named Alex Spiro as CleanCore’s incoming board chair, Dogecoin Foundation director Timothy Stebbing as a new board member, and Margiotta as CIO. Market reaction has been swift. CleanCore shares jumped after hours on Monday following disclosure of the $68 million initial buy, rebounding from a sharp drop when the financing plan was first unveiled on Sept. 2. The stock is up 8.4% yesterday and 30% over the past 5 days. For Dogecoin, the scale is non-trivial but not dominant. With DOGE trading near $0.236–$0.24 and circulating supply around 150.86 billion, CleanCore’s initial tranche represents roughly 0.19% of supply; the 1-billion-DOGE 30-day target would lift that footprint to ~0.66%. Whether the foundation-backed structure affects liquidity or price formation will depend on execution speed, sources of liquidity, and how the treasury’s governance framework interfaces with counterparties—areas where the parties say House of Doge and 21Shares will provide oversight and reporting. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.23597.

51444977,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=818570,1757419259,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/51444977.jpeg,Whales Are Buying Solana: Two Wallets Pull 376K Tokens From Binance,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/whales-are-buying-solana-two-wallets-pull-376k-tokens-from-binance/,"Solana (SOL) is entering a pivotal phase after rallying more than 40% since early August, pushing the price to its highest level since February. This remarkable surge has reignited bullish sentiment, with traders and investors now closely watching whether Solana can sustain its momentum or if a period of consolidation lies ahead. The coming days are expected to be decisive in determining the next major price direction for SOL. Related Reading: Ethereum Dominates Trading Volume Despite Market Cool-Off – Details Despite ongoing volatility across the broader crypto market, Solana bulls are showing resilience. The asset’s sharp recovery underscores renewed confidence in its ecosystem, driven by strong network activity, DeFi adoption, and its positioning as one of the leading Ethereum competitors. Yet, the key factor supporting optimism comes from on-chain data. According to Lookonchain, whales have been actively accumulating SOL during this rally, signaling strong conviction in its long-term potential. The presence of large-scale buyers suggests that even amid fluctuations, demand for Solana remains elevated. This behavior highlights a critical dynamic: whales often position themselves ahead of major moves, reinforcing the bullish narrative surrounding SOL. Whether this momentum continues will depend on how Solana reacts to resistance levels in the coming sessions, making this a crucial moment for investors and traders alike. Whale Moves Signal Growing Confidence In Solana Lookonchain reports that in the past 24 hours, two whale wallets withdrew a combined 376,076 SOL (valued at approximately $80.7 million) from Binance and transferred the tokens to Kamino. This move not only underscores whale confidence in Solana’s long-term potential but also signals a broader trend in the market: investors are rotating capital into large-cap altcoins in anticipation of a rally. Such large-scale withdrawals are typically interpreted as a bullish sign. By moving funds from centralized exchanges to DeFi protocols like Kamino, whales demonstrate an intent to hold or deploy capital strategically for yield, rather than prepare for near-term selling. This conviction aligns with the broader strength we’ve seen across altcoins in recent weeks. Ethereum’s recent pause has created a window of opportunity for alternative layer-1 networks like Solana to shine. If ETH continues to consolidate, capital rotation into SOL and other altcoins could accelerate, pushing them into fresh rallies. The market has already rewarded Solana with an impressive surge since early August, and whale accumulation only reinforces the bullish outlook. Related Reading: Bitcoin LTH Aging Velocity Turns Negative: Distribution Phase Unfolds Technical Details: Price Testing Key Resistance Solana is showing strong momentum, trading at $218.91 after a sharp 9.37% daily surge. The chart highlights that SOL is now testing a critical resistance zone not seen since early 2025, marking its highest levels in months. This recovery follows a steady uptrend from the May lows near $140, with the price supported by higher lows and consistent buying pressure. The 50-day moving average (blue) sits well below the current price at $167.48, reflecting strong bullish momentum, while the 100-day (green) at $177.10 and the 200-day (red) at $163.01 confirm that the medium and long-term trend remains positive. As long as SOL stays above these key averages, the bullish structure is intact. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cycle Structure Questioned As VDD Mirrors Historic Tops However, SOL is now confronting a significant resistance barrier around $220–$225, a zone that has rejected rallies in the past. A decisive breakout above this level could open the path toward $250 and beyond, pushing the token into a new bullish phase. On the downside, a failure to break resistance could lead to a retest of support levels at $200 and $185.

Why Experts Say the Real Surge Is Ahead,https://cryptopotato.com/is-xrp-still-cheap-why-experts-say-the-real-surge-is-ahead/,"TL;DR XRP has exited a 49-day downtrend and may target $3.65 if momentum holds. Analysts identify three phases of XRP accumulation, pointing to a potential move past $7. Numerous XRP ETF applications await SEC review, possibly drawing more market interest in October. XRP Trades Below Fair Value Range, Analyst Says XRP remains in the lower range of a long-term price channel, according to a chart shared by CryptoBull. The model places current price levels under $4 in a red zone marked as “undervalued.” The following two zones are higher, $4 to $45 in dark green, and $45 to $250 in light green, suggesting upside potential if market momentum continues. #XRP is still within the undervalued red zone. Dark green price is $4-$45 and light green is $45-$250. pic.twitter.com/pGdI6F1Cwf — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) September 8, 2025 At present, XRP is trading at $3, with a 24-hour trading volume of $6.62 billion. The token has gained 2% in the last 24 hours and 7% over the past week. Based on this model, the asset has yet to enter what the analyst considers a fair value zone. Long-Term Structure Shows Multi-Phase Accumulation Another analyst, Jackis, shared a broader view of XRP’s structure, identifying three main accumulation phases. The first phase began in 2022 and lasted until early 2024. A second phase followed in early 2025, showing a base forming between previous highs and support levels. A third, smaller accumulation area is forming just under the 2017 all-time high, which was near $3.80. The price is now holding just below that level, in what Jackis called the “last tiny re-accumulation.” They noted, “XRP has not said its last word, ” and suggested that moves like this often occur before breakouts . They added that each accumulation phase has taken less time than the one before. This kind of structure, known for time compression, can signal that a larger move may be building. If current levels hold, their chart points to a possible move beyond $7.00 later this year. XRP Breaks Trendline After 49-Day Slide XRP has also broken out of a downtrend that lasted 49 days, according to CryptoWZRD. The move came after the token pushed above a lower high trendline. If momentum holds, the analyst says $3.65 could be the next level to watch. Meanwhile, exchange reserves reached a 12-month high, suggesting more tokens have moved onto trading platforms. Separately, Federal Reserve futures show a 78% chance of a 25-basis point rate cut on September 17. A rate cut would weaken the dollar, which often supports crypto assets like XRP. Source: Polymarket In addition, over a dozen spot XRP ETF applications are currently under review by the SEC. The filings are expected to be addressed in October and are seen as a potential driver for market attention. The post Is XRP Still Cheap?

This is the Sign",https://timestabloid.com/xrp-analyst-remember-it-when-this-happens-sell-everything-this-is-the-sign/,"Egrag Crypto has sounded a sharp warning that could resonate across the financial and crypto markets. In a recent post on X, the analyst spotlighted a video shared by President Trump , featuring Representative Anna Paulina Luna, who revealed that a discharge petition is ready to force a House vote on banning congressional stock trading. Egrag interprets this as a decisive market signal — a moment when traders should consider liquidating positions to avoid turbulence. The Political Backdrop Representative Luna’s comments underscore a growing frustration in Washington. She declared that if House leadership does not schedule a floor vote, she and allies will activate the petition, which requires signatures from a majority of lawmakers to succeed. This tool, seldom used in Congress, strips leadership of control and demonstrates the seriousness of the push. A groundswell of discontent fuels the push for a ban, as lawmakers’ stock trades spark whispers of blurred lines and compromised integrity. A bipartisan group of legislators has introduced bills that would require elected officials to place their assets in blind trusts or restrict them to diversified funds. With the petition ready, the issue is approaching a breaking point. Remember it, when this happens sell everything this is the sign pic.twitter.com/SDRQDuv8ww — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) September 9, 2025 Why It Matters The perception of self-dealing among lawmakers has long eroded public confidence. High-profile cases have kept the controversy alive, especially trades made by households of influential members such as former Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Performance whispers secrets of an edge – reports reveal outsized returns, leaving skeptics to wonder if privileged whispers tilt the scales. This pressure is not just about optics — it cuts to the credibility of democratic representation. As Luna and her colleagues argue, lawmakers cannot claim to act solely in the public’s interest while simultaneously benefiting from trades that may be influenced by privileged information. If the petition succeeds, it could mark the most significant ethics reform for Congress in decades. Market Implications Egrag Crypto views the discharge petition as a tipping point with far-reaching market consequences. A ban on congressional stock trading would signal that even the highest levels of government are willing to restrict speculative profit channels. For traders, this represents a high-volatility scenario that requires portfolio protection. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Political catalysts of this magnitude have the power to move markets abruptly. Headline-driven volatility is particularly dangerous for speculative assets such as small-cap equities and cryptocurrencies. Algo-driven armies march in lockstep, magnifying market tremors – then retail investors join the fray, stoking the volatility flames. In this environment, Egrag’s directive to “sell everything” reflects the need for swift and disciplined risk management rather than panic . Watching the Next Steps The key variable now is whether the discharge petition garners enough signatures. If market momentum increases, traders can anticipate a shift of capital toward safer investments. Portfolio managers will likely tighten stop-losses, reduce speculative exposure, and prepare hedges against volatility. Final Takeaway Egrag Crypto’s warning highlights how quickly politics can alter market dynamics. The looming petition is not merely a procedural tactic; it is a signal that change is imminent, and traders must be prepared. When politics disrupts the status quo, hesitation can be costly.

Bernstein, a respected name in financial analysis, has just initiated coverage of Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD) with an “Outperform” rating, setting an impressive price target of $160. This bold move comes as Robinhood prepares for a significant milestone: its official addition to the S&P 500 index on September 22. What’s Driving This Optimism for Robinhood Stock? Bernstein’s optimistic outlook isn’t just a shot in the dark; it’s backed by robust projections. The firm forecasts substantial revenue growth for Robinhood, expecting it to jump from $2.9 billion in 2024 to an impressive $6.8 billion by 2026. This significant growth trajectory highlights confidence in Robinhood’s evolving business model and market position. Currently, shares in the company are already showing strong momentum, trading at $117.28 in pre-market, marking a solid 15.83% increase. This early reaction underscores the market’s positive reception to the analyst’s endorsement. Key Factors Boosting Robinhood’s Potential Several factors contribute to Bernstein’s positive assessment and the market’s enthusiastic response to Robinhood stock . The platform, initially known for commission-free trading, has expanded its offerings considerably. This now includes cryptocurrency trading, retirement accounts, and advanced investing tools. This diversification helps to attract a broader user base and retain existing customers. Moreover, the upcoming S&P 500 inclusion is a game-changer. Being part of the S&P 500 index means: Increased Visibility: Robinhood will gain exposure to a vast pool of institutional investors. Enhanced Liquidity: Index funds tracking the S&P 500 will automatically purchase Robinhood stock , driving demand. Credibility Boost: Inclusion signals a company’s financial health and market stability, enhancing investor confidence. How Does S&P 500 Inclusion Impact Robinhood Stock Investors? For current and prospective investors, the S&P 500 inclusion is more than just a prestige factor. It often leads to a sustained upward trend in a company’s share price due to the forced buying by index funds. This institutional demand creates a strong buying pressure that can support the stock’s valuation. Historically, companies added to the S&P 500 often experience a rally in the weeks leading up to and immediately following their inclusion. Therefore, this development is a critical point for anyone considering an investment in Robinhood stock . Understanding Bernstein’s Revenue Projections Bernstein’s forecast of Robinhood’s revenue soaring to $6.8 billion by 2026 is based on several assumptions. These likely include continued user growth, increased engagement with its diverse product suite, and potential expansion into new markets or services. As a company that thrives on transaction volumes and assets under management, Robinhood’s ability to innovate and capture market share will be crucial. The firm’s ability to navigate regulatory landscapes and competitive pressures will also play a significant role in achieving these ambitious targets. This positive forecast directly impacts the perceived value of Robinhood stock . What’s Next for Robinhood and Its Growth Trajectory? The path ahead for Robinhood looks promising, but like any growth stock, it will face its share of challenges. Competition from established brokers and emerging fintech platforms remains intense. Regulatory scrutiny, especially in the cryptocurrency space, is an ongoing factor. However, with a strong user base, a recognized brand, and now the backing of a major analyst firm and S&P 500 inclusion, Robinhood appears well-positioned for continued expansion. Investors will be keenly watching how the company leverages these advantages to meet and potentially exceed Bernstein’s optimistic projections for Robinhood stock . In conclusion, Bernstein’s initiation of coverage with an “Outperform” rating and a $160 price target, coupled with the imminent S&P 500 inclusion, paints a remarkably bullish picture for Robinhood. The anticipated revenue growth and increased institutional interest could provide significant tailwinds for the company’s valuation.

Fundstrat’s Tom Lee’s Bold Bitcoin Forecast Fuels Bitcoin Hyper Presale Surge,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/tom-lee-bitcoin-200k-prediction-bitcoin-hyper-presale-14-6m/,"Tom Lee, the Managing Partner of Fundstrat Global Advisors, CNBC, stated that Bitcoin could reach $200K by the end of this year. Known for making bold financial predictions in the past, Lee anticipates that the U.S. central bank’s upcoming interest rate cut on September 17, 2025, will trigger a surge in $BTC prices. Lee added that assets like Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum can be very sensitive to changes in monetary policy, and the upcoming interest rate cut could serve as a major catalyst for driving the price increase. According to CoinMarketCap , Bitcoin has risen by 1.37% in the past 24 hours, rounding off the price of one token to $112,510.63. The coin performed slightly less than the broader total crypto market, which saw gains of roughly 1.6%. Tom Lee’s latest Bitcoin price forecast is turning heads and fueling momentum for the Bitcoin Hyper presale . His bullish prediction has sparked a surge in market optimism, capturing the attention of both retail traders and institutional investors. As confidence grows, Bitcoin Hyper emerges as a key player, drawing in those eager to capitalize on the next big crypto opportunity. Tom Lee’s Shocking Predictions That Actually Came True In The Past As one of the most respected financial advisors globally, Tom Lee has earned a reputation for his insightful Bitcoin predictions. Over the years, many of his forecasts have proven spot-on, while others have been close to the mark, further cementing his status as a trusted voice in the crypto world. In 2017, Lee predicted the emergence of $BTC as a scarce store of value and forecasted a price surge for $BTC from around $2,500 to a significantly higher rate by the end of that year. He has also forecasted that Bitcoin prices would reach $20K by 2022. However, $BTC prices surpassed his predictions and peaked at over $69K in 2021. Lee’s prediction for Bitcoin materialized earlier than expected. Another prediction by Lee in January 2018 suggested that BTC prices would reach $125K by 2022, a milestone achieved almost three years later than his suggested time period. Considering the credibility of Lee’s past forecasts, his latest $BTC prediction has reignited attention to Bitcoin and related projects among investors. Additionally, data from CoinMarketCap indicate a bullish momentum with indicators like RSI and MACD, steering additional interest toward Bitcoin-based tokens like Bitcoin Hyper. Can Inflation and Jobs Reports Dictate Bitcoin’s Near-Term Momentum? As the world braces for the Federal Reserve’s “Make-or-Break” Data week beginning September 8th, 2025, crypto experts expect the Fed’s policy decisions and interest rate changes to catalyze $BTC’s near-term momentum. Speculation is building around the possibility of aggressive interest rate cuts, with some forecasts predicting a reduction of up to 50 basis points. FedWatch data , however, points to at least a 25-basis-point cut, signaling potential shifts in the market that investors are closely watching. Experts expect a 90% chance of this event occurring, which could boost Bitcoin’s price. However, if the Fed plans to delay the interest rate cuts due to high inflation, Bitcoin’s price rally could stagnate. Although the Fed’s policy decisions may increase market volatility, they could also boost the price of BTC in the short to medium term. Investors can take comfort in that the ‘Make or Break’ Data week lays the groundwork for a bullish Q4 for $BTC and $HYPER in 2025, assuming rate cuts happen. What Bitcoin’s September Surge Means for Bitcoin Hyper’s Exploding $14.6M Presale? Bitcoin’s strong momentum this year is gaining more traction for the Bitcoin Hyper presale. This Layer 2 solution, built to enhance Bitcoin’s utility and scalability, launched its presale on May 14, 2025. $HYPER, powered by Ethereum, is set to tackle significant challenges like high fees, sluggish transactions, and restricted contract functionalities by utilizing Solana’s advanced virtual machine. This innovative approach enhances scalability and paves the way for $BTC holders to unlock new possibilities, expanding the potential of decentralized applications (DApps) and opening fresh avenues for Bitcoin in DeFi and NFTs. Bitcoin Hyper’s presale has raised just over $14.6M to date, selling tokens to presale participants at $0.0115 each. The project also plans to list on exchanges at nearly $0.013 and anticipates a potential 13% post-listing upside. $HYPER offers staking rewards for early participants with APYs up to ~150%, allowing you to increase your token holdings during the presale phase. You can join the Bitcoin Hyper presale using cryptocurrency or fiat options via their presale website. Two highly acclaimed blockchain security firms — Coinsult and SpyWolf — audited Bitcoin Hyper’s token, confirming that the project is secure with no backdoors, hidden mint functions, or blacklist features. The audit results vouch for Bitcoin Hyper’s credibility, security, and transparency. The presale prices are rising gradually as $HYPER nears its listing price. Check out the $HYPER presale website today to become an early investor and reap the benefits. That said, always conduct your own research before investing in cryptocurrencies, as the market involves significant risks and high volatility. This article isn’t financial advice.

Now, it might be its shield. The U.S., Japan, and the U.K. are all watching their central banks come under fire. But the ECB, by contrast, is tangled in too many national interests and legal knots to be easily bent. Governments push Fed, BoJ, BoE toward political control In the U.S., Donald Trump’s people are already working on plans to reshape the Federal Reserve . The Fed used to be the golden standard of independence. That’s over. Most investors now expect a shift toward political control, and they don’t think it’ll end well. Why? Because the U.S. is drowning in public debt. And when your debt’s that high, keeping interest payments low becomes a political survival tactic. The Fed is being leaned on hard. It has to keep rates low to make sure the U.S. can pay its bills. But inflation is still above 2%. Japan isn’t in much better shape, with the Liberal Democratic Party about to choose a new prime minister. The favorite, Sanae Takaichi, doesn’t like the Bank of Japan raising rates. She’s calling for tighter coordination between the BoJ and the government. That’s code for more political pressure. The BoJ’s independence was already weak compared to other G7 banks. Now it’s almost gone. The U.K.’s Bank of England is still officially “independent.” But it’s been less than 30 years since that was even a thing. And pressure is building. Britain’s debt levels are rising. The BoE has close ties with the government, especially on inflation targeting and its balance sheet. That puts it low on the autonomy scale within the G7. So while these three giants deal with government interference, the ECB sits in the middle of a mess that’s actually helping it. It has no single government to report to. Its structure is annoying and slow, but that means no single leader can easily hijack its agenda. What used to be a flaw now acts like body armor. Bond yields jump and investors push euro higher Last week, long-term bond yields surged across global markets, which spooked everyone watching deficit financing risks. The fear is that if yields stay high, governments will struggle to cover their debt. Europe might have a shot at fixing things by 2026 through tighter fiscal control. But don’t count on the U.S. doing the same. Bond yields are surging even as central banks begin easing policy. That’s not normal. Normally, yields fall when central banks shift dovish. But the last 12 months have been different. Investors aren’t buying it. They see too much debt and too much risk. So they’re demanding higher returns. Take a look at the numbers. 30-year U.S. Treasuries hit 4.99% last week. 30-year U.K. Gilts jumped to 5.69%. That’s the highest since 1998. Even if interest payments as a percentage of GDP aren’t at crisis levels yet, these trends don’t point anywhere good. Meanwhile, the euro is climbing toward $1.20. Traders are betting that the eurozone will come out ahead if the ECB and the Fed keep heading in different directions. On Thursday, the euro briefly hit $1.1780, its strongest level since late July, before pulling back a little. Options markets are showing the same pattern. Risk reversals are leaning bullish, with one in three long bets placed since Friday targeting a break above $1.20. According to Thomas Bureau, co-head of FX options at Societe Generale, $1.18 is the resistance level to watch. Once that cracks, stop-losses could trigger a surge.

This new acquisition will significantly boost their digital asset holdings. The Mechanics: How Convano is Funding its Bitcoin Ambition To facilitate this substantial Convano Bitcoin purchase , the Japanese firm is issuing its fifth series of corporate bonds. This method allows Convano to raise the necessary capital without diluting existing shareholder equity. Funding Source: Issuance of corporate bonds. Amount Raised: 20 billion yen, equivalent to $136.4 million. Purpose: Exclusively for additional Bitcoin acquisitions. Timeline: Completion of the acquisition is targeted for the end of November. Issuing corporate bonds for a Bitcoin investment is a significant step. It shows a strong commitment and a well-thought-out financial strategy to integrate digital assets into their balance sheet. This approach also provides transparency regarding their funding methods. What Does Convano’s Bitcoin Purchase Mean for the Market? Convano’s latest Convano Bitcoin purchase could have several ripple effects.

Diversification Trend: It highlights a growing trend among companies to diversify away from traditional assets, seeking new avenues for growth and value preservation.

It suggests that even companies outside the tech or finance sectors are seeing the potential.

With thousands of tokens competing for attention, it’s hard to separate hype from real opportunity. But one project is starting to stand out to analysts: Pepeto (PEPETO) . Built on Ethereum and still in its presale at just $0.000000152, Pepeto is combining meme culture with real utility in a way Dogecoin never has, making it a serious contender for the next breakout. Why Pepeto Offers a Clear Edge Many meme coins exist only on hype, offering little beyond speculation. Pepeto, however, has been purpose-built to deliver real value from the start. While the Ethereum blockchain can often be slow and expensive, Pepeto fixes that problem by launching with PepetoSwap, a zero fee decentralized exchange, and PepetoBridge, which enables fast, secure cross chain transfers. This makes Pepeto more accessible to everyday users, while staking rewards of 231% APY give holders strong incentives to stay invested. Unlike Dogecoin (DOGE) , which is mostly just used for payments, Pepeto is adding tools that make it more useful. Pepeto is positioning itself as a dynamic ecosystem that blends culture with utility. Pepeto’s Early Stage Makes It the Best Crypto to Buy At just $0.000000152 in presale, the entry price is accessible to both casual traders and serious investors looking for high-upside opportunities. This positions Pepeto as more than a short-lived meme, it is shaping up to be one of the best cryptos to buy in 2025 . With audited contracts, a growing community of over 100,000, whales already accumulating, and more than $6.6 million raised, the rewards are clear for those who act early. How Pepeto Compares to Dogecoin There’s no denying Dogecoin has a special place in crypto. DOGE commands a market cap of over $30 billion and has built a loyal following. But its growth has slowed. Beyond community support and some celebrity endorsements, it hasn’t introduced meaningful updates or evolved its utility. Most analysts see Dogecoin moving between $1 and $2 in this bull run according to current Dogecoin price predictions, which would deliver solid gains but not the kind of 100x explosions early buyers once enjoyed. Pepeto, on the other hand, is still in presale at just $0.000000152. A $2,500 buy secures over 16 billion tokens, and if Pepeto reaches the valuations Dogecoin has already hit, that could be worth more than $1 million. With zero fee trading on PepetoSwap, secure cross chain transfers via PepetoBridge, and staking rewards of 231% APY, Pepeto offers both meme appeal and real utility, giving it far greater upside than Dogecoin today. Conclusion: Don’t Miss This Opportunity The search for the best crypto to buy in 2025 often leads back to established names like DOGE, but real upside usually comes from new projects with strong foundations. Pepeto offers just that. With PEPETO priced at $0.000000152, a live presale, more than $6.6 million raised, and staking rewards of 231% APY for early buyers, the opportunity is clear. DOGE may continue to hold cultural relevance, but Pepeto is building something bigger: meme power combined with real blockchain utility.

51445962,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=818712,1757420843,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/51445962.jpeg,Top Crypto Presales to Watch as the Market Prepares for Recovery,https://www.newsbtc.com/crypto/top-crypto-presales-to-watch-as-the-market-prepares-for-recovery/,"The crypto market seems sleepy no more. Bitcoin looks oversold and ready to bounce, Ethereum is catching its breath, and XRP even smells recovery brewing. That lull in volatility might just be the calm before a fresh bull wave. If you’re hunting for the next big upside, presales are a tried-and-true way to get in early. Think of meme coins that once started as jokes and turned into deep-pocket fortunes, or altcoins so solid they quietly became staples. Here are three best crypto presales that could surge if the market wakes up. We’ll walk you through why each is catching steam, what they do, and what makes them worth a look. Market Is Catching Its Breath Before the Next Move The latest market data paints an odd picture. Ethereum , usually the king of big swings, has almost flatlined in volatility. At around $4,350, ETH looks like it’s asleep at the wheel, with daily candles shrinking and trading volume fading fast. Analysts warn that a lack of movement can be dangerous, but history shows it often ends with fireworks – either a breakout to $4,6K or a slip back to $3,6K. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is quietly setting up for a potential surge. Trading at around $112K, it sits just above its 100-day moving average with an RSI (Relative Strength Index) of 47, a zone that has often signaled oversold conditions. XRP is also staging a comeback, bouncing off $2.77 support and testing resistance at $3. Together, these signs suggest the lull could be temporary. And when majors stall, new crypto projects often become the spark that grabs fresh capital and investor excitement. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – The Fastest Layer-2 Built to Unleash $BTC Bitcoin may be the ultimate store of value, but in this market cycle that’s not enough. As the latest news shows, $BTC is hovering just above long-term support and could be gearing up for another run. If Bitcoin does wake up, the projects that supercharge it will shine brightest. That’s where Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) comes in. Right now, you can buy $HYPER for $0.012885, and the presale has already raised $14.6M. Unlike sidechains or half-measures, Bitcoin Hyper is a full Layer-2 blockchain built to scale Bitcoin into something far more usable. It delivers sub-second transactions, near-zero fees, and cross-chain compatibility from day one. That means Bitcoin can finally host meme coins , dApps, and DeFi instead of watching Ethereum and Solana take all the action. Under the hood, Bitcoin Hyper runs on the Solana Virtual Machine, giving it proven speed and seamless integration with Solana’s ecosystem. Think of Bitcoin as the base layer of money and Hyper as the execution layer where everything happens – payments, trading, culture, and community. For presale buyers, $HYPER is more than a token. It’s a stake in Bitcoin’s future. 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Your Key to the Next Wave of Presales In a market where Ethereum has gone quiet and traders are waiting for the next big move, early access becomes priceless. That’s what Best Wallet Token ($BEST) delivers. You can buy $BEST for just $0.025615 per token and with $15.6M already raised in presale, $BEST is a ticket to be first in line when the next breakout altcoin arrives. Best Wallet is already carving out a space as a next-generation app, built to challenge outdated tools like MetaMask with a smoother interface and Fireblocks-level security. But the real value for $BEST holders is what comes next. Holding the token unlocks reduced transaction fees, governance rights, and boosted staking rewards. Most importantly, it gives exclusive access to Upcoming Tokens, a built-in tool that lets you join new crypto presales directly inside the app without dodgy links or scam mirrors. With a growing social following and a self-proclaimed 50% user growth every month, the Best Wallet ecosystem is heating up fast. If XRP and Bitcoin keep showing recovery signs, $BEST holders will already have front-row seats to the next wave of launches. 3. Layer Brett ($LBRETT) – Meme Power Meets Layer-2 Speed When Bitcoin hints at a rebound and Ethereum sits in a lull, meme coins often return to center stage. But Layer Brett ($LBRETT) isn’t your average meme coin – it’s blending culture with real infrastructure. Priced at $0.0055 and already raising $3.1M in its presale, $LBRETT shows there’s strong appetite for a project that goes beyond the jokes. Built as an Ethereum Layer-2 solution, Layer Brett offers what the majors are currently lacking: speed, low fees, and fresh momentum. It delivers sub-second transactions, supports NFT tie-ins, and comes with staking rewards that stretch into triple digits – some APYs reaching as high as 800%. For a market hungry for excitement, that’s like handing degens a rocket with a meme mascot strapped to the side. The idea is simple but powerful: use meme branding to attract attention, then back it up with a tech stack that actually works. If meme coins roar back during this recovery cycle, Layer Brett could be the one that lasts. It’s fun, it’s functional, and it’s already gaining traction before hitting the wider market. Crypto Presales at the Front of the Recovery Stage Presales have always been the noisy campfires of crypto, where early believers gather, stories are told, and fortunes sometimes spark overnight. They carry risk, sure, but they also carry the thrill of being first in line when momentum shifts. With Bitcoin showing signs of life, Ethereum poised for its next move, and XRP sniffing out recovery, timing couldn’t be more interesting. Bitcoin Hyper , Best Wallet Token , and Layer Brett each bring a unique edge – scaling tech, access to early launches, and meme-driven energy with real muscle. If the market rebounds, these presales could ride the wave from the very front. Remember that this article isn’t financial advice.

51445968,577774,1757420848,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51445968.jpeg,Đầu tư 1.000 USD vào Altcoin AI đã thành 10.000 USD – Vẫn còn kịp mua trước khi đạt 1 USD,https://bitcoinist.com/ai-altcoin-10000-gains-buy-before-1-vn/,"Đầu tư 1.000 USD vào đồng altcoin AI này từ giai đoạn 1 hiện đã tăng lên hơn 10.000 USD. Các token ứng dụng trí tuệ nhân tạo đang trở thành xu hướng nổi bật trong năm 2025, thu hút sự quan tâm mạnh mẽ từ những nhà đầu tư sớm. Dù đã có mức tăng trưởng ấn tượng, giá đồng coin này vẫn đang dưới 0,01 USD – đồng nghĩa vẫn còn nhiều cơ hội cho trader trước khi nó tiến gần tới mốc 1 USD. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) Giá presale chỉ 0,01286 USD đã giúp Bitcoin Hyper thu hút sự chú ý mạnh mẽ từ cả nhà đầu tư cá nhân lẫn tổ chức. Với giải pháp Layer-2 xây dựng trên Bitcoin, tích hợp Solana Virtual Machine và Canonical Bridge, dự án đã huy động được hơn 14 triệu USD, cho thấy niềm tin lớn từ cộng đồng đầu tư. Những người tham gia sớm đã ghi nhận lợi nhuận đáng kể, biến HYPER trở thành một trong những presale blockchain & AI được nhắc đến nhiều nhất năm 2025. Cấu trúc presale gồm nhiều giai đoạn, và dù giai đoạn đầu mang lại mức tăng nhanh nhất, nhưng ở giai đoạn hiện tại, nhà đầu tư vẫn có thể mua token với mức giá ưu đãi. Điều này mở ra cơ hội tham gia trước khi Bitcoin Hyper tiến gần đến các mốc giá mục tiêu trong tương lai. Tại sao mốc giá 1 USD lại quan trọng Các nhà phân tích cho rằng Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) hoàn toàn có thể đạt mốc 1 USD sau khi ra mắt chính thức — tương đương mức lợi nhuận hơn 80 lần so với giá presale hiện tại khoảng 0,01286 USD. Tiềm năng tăng trưởng này được hậu thuẫn bởi công nghệ Layer-2 trên mạng Bitcoin, tích hợp Solana Virtual Machine và Canonical Bridge, mang đến khả năng giao dịch nhanh hơn, mở rộng quy mô và triển khai smart contract tiên tiến. Để so sánh, các dự án lớn như Ethereum hay Solana phải mất nhiều năm mới đạt được giai đoạn bùng nổ đầu tiên. Trong khi đó, Bitcoin Hyper bước vào thị trường với ứng dụng thực tiễn ngay lập tức cùng nhu cầu đầu tư mạnh mẽ, nhờ đó có thể rút ngắn lộ trình tiến tới lợi nhuận khổng lồ. Lợi thế của presale Bitcoin Hyper: Tại sao nên mua ngay bây giờ Đầu tư vào giai đoạn presale của Bitcoin Hyper mang lại nhiều lợi ích rõ ràng. Người tham gia sớm được mua token với mức giá thấp hơn nhiều so với giá thị trường dự kiến, tận hưởng tiềm năng lợi nhuận cao hơn so với sau khi niêm yết, đồng thời có thể nhận thêm quyền lợi như staking với lợi suất lên tới ~78% APY và quyền tham gia quản trị trong hệ sinh thái. Một lợi thế lớn khác là presale của Bitcoin Hyper không yêu cầu KYC trong giai đoạn đầu, giúp nhà đầu tư toàn cầu tham gia dễ dàng. Khi token được niêm yết trên các nền tảng như CoinMarketCap và CoinGecko, tính thanh khoản và mức độ chấp nhận của HYPER dự kiến sẽ tăng mạnh, mang lại thêm nhiều cơ hội cho những ai mua sớm. Quan hệ đối tác chiến lược thúc đẩy tiềm năng tăng trưởng Bitcoin Hyper đã thiết lập quan hệ hợp tác với các tổ chức hạ tầng blockchain và công ty kiểm toán hàng đầu như Coinsult và SpyWolf, đảm bảo tính minh bạch và an toàn cho nhà đầu tư. Những hợp tác này không chỉ nâng cao uy tín dự án mà còn đặt nền móng cho việc mở rộng phạm vi ứng dụng. Bên cạnh đó, Bitcoin Hyper chú trọng vào khả năng mở rộng, tính tiện dụng và các chứng nhận bảo mật, tạo sự khác biệt trên thị trường cạnh tranh khốc liệt. Với nền tảng công nghệ vững chắc và kiểm toán minh bạch, HYPER mang lại sự tin tưởng rằng dự án có thể thực hiện đúng cam kết và đạt thành công lâu dài, vượt xa yếu tố đầu cơ ngắn hạn. Giới thiệu về Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) là một dự án Layer-2 thế hệ mới được xây dựng trên mạng Bitcoin. Nhờ tích hợp Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) và Canonical Bridge, dự án mang đến khả năng mở rộng vượt trội, tốc độ giao dịch nhanh và chức năng cross-chain liền mạch. Khác với các altcoin truyền thống, Bitcoin Hyper kết hợp sự an toàn của mạng Bitcoin với tính linh hoạt của smart contract nâng cao, tạo nên một hệ sinh thái phục vụ DeFi, gaming và Web3. Kiến trúc độc đáo này giúp HYPER trở thành một dự án đột phá năm 2025, có tiềm năng thúc đẩy ứng dụng thực tế và mang lại tăng trưởng bền vững.",Uncategorized,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|ALTCOIN|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-09 12:27:28
