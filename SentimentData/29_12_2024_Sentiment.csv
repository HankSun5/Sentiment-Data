Reportedly, AI is draining the country’s electricity like a high-tech vampire. As data centers multiply, guzzling more power than entire cities, millions of homes are getting hit with distorted power flows that wreak havoc on their appliances and jack up fire risks. “Bad harmonics” is the name of this nightmare. Normally, electricity flows smoothly, like ocean waves. But when AI-fueled data centers crank up their demands, those waves turn chaotic, destabilizing everything downstream. Think of it as a speaker blaring music so loudly it fries itself. That’s what’s happening to America’s power grid. Refrigerators start rattling, air conditioners overheat, and sparks can fly—literally. Whisker Labs, a company tracking power quality with one million sensors across U.S. homes, has reportedly uncovered a grim reality. The closer a home is to a data center, the worse the distortions. More than half of the homes with the worst power quality issues sit within 20 miles of a data center. That’s 3.7 million Americans caught in the crossfire of the AI boom. Data centers are turning the grid into a ticking time bomb Experts have been sounding the alarm about the impact of data centers for years, but AI has put this problem on steroids. These facilities are popping up like mushrooms, each demanding as much electricity as 10,000 homes. But the grid wasn’t built for this kind of pressure. The AI frenzy has turned Northern Virginia into ground zero. Dubbed “data center alley,” the region now holds 3,000 megawatts of data center capacity—double that of Beijing, its closest competitor. The power demands are so massive that Dominion Energy, the utility serving much of the area, is scrambling to build a new transmission line just to keep the lights on. In Prince William County, sensors installed in homes within seven miles of data centers showed alarming distortion levels. The report says nearly 6% of these homes reported power quality so bad it risks frying appliances. Some readings spiked as high as 12.9%, way beyond the 8% threshold where equipment starts failing. Meanwhile, York County, 80 miles from the nearest major data center, reported steady, low distortion levels. The connection is undeniable. AI is pushing America to the brink America’s grid was already hanging by a thread before AI came into the picture. Decades of underinvestment in infrastructure mean the system is aging and fragile. Now, electricity demand is set to spike by 16% over the next five years, with AI-driven data centers driving most of the growth. This isn’t just a city problem either. Even rural areas near data centers are seeing distorted power flows. A Bloomberg analysis showed that homes close to data centers had way worse power quality, even if they were in low-density areas. Bad harmonics also lead to billions of dollars in equipment failures, repairs, and lost productivity. It’s a slow bleed that’s adding up fast. Utilities like Dominion Energy and Exelon’s Commonwealth Edison are trying to downplay the issue. Dominion claims its systems are within industry standards, while ComEd outright disputes Whisker Labs’ findings. But here’s the problem, utilities often rely on outdated measurement tools that miss the granular, home-level data captured by Whisker Labs. So while utilities say everything is fine, residents are dealing with flickering lights, blown-out appliances, and rising repair bills.

Over the past few days, DOGE has experienced a significant drop, but recent consolidation, continuous accumulation by whales, and a shift in market sentiment might be driving potential upside momentum. Can Dogecoin (DOGE) Break $0.36? Key Levels to Watch Amid market uncertainty and ongoing consolidation, DOGE has formed a descending triangle pattern on the four-hour timeframe and is poised for a breakout. DOGE Price Prediction According to expert technical analysis, if the meme coin breaches this pattern and closes a candle above the $0.327 mark on the same timeframe, there is a strong possibility it could surge by 11% to reach $0.36 in the near future. Source: Trading View However, this speculation is based on a short timeframe and could appear in the coming days. On the daily timeframe, DOGE appears to be consolidating within a tight range below the crucial support level of $0.36. Based on recent price action, if DOGE breaks out of this narrow zone and closes a daily candle above the $0.36 mark, there is a strong possibility it could surge by 30% to reach $0.465 in the coming days. Source: Trading View Whales Accumulate 90 Million DOGE Amid this ongoing consolidation, whales have demonstrated strong interest and confidence in the meme coin. According to a prominent crypto expert’s post on X (formerly Twitter), whales have purchased a significant 90 million DOGE tokens. This substantial accumulation by whales has the potential to create buying pressure and drive further upside momentum.

Personal data security firm Leakd says it’s discovered five terabytes of screenshots online containing five million unique credit card and debit card numbers, as well as financial records and personal information. According to Leakd’s security team, the exposed data stash specifically contains users’ full names, billing addresses, email addresses, phone numbers and credit card details. While the firm says the entity behind the large data leak continues to remain anonymous, it notes that many of the screenshots bear the logo of Braniacshop, a “definitely questionable” website, according to Scam Detector . Leakd also says that the party responsible may have launched a deliberate data-harvesting campaign after discovering many instances involving “too-good-to-be-true” promotional offers. “The leaked screenshots often featured instances of users entering personal and financial details into seemingly innocent promotional forms. These offers, promising rewards like a free iPhone 14 or heavily discounted items, were just traps. With prices as low as $3, they often hid deceptive disclaimers about trial periods and auto-renewal charges.” Source: Leakd.com Leakd estimates that the potential financial value of the looted data trove could be worth north of $85 million. The firm says users who think their data may have been exposed can take several steps to protect themselves including monitoring financial accounts for suspicious activity, setting up fraud alerts and freezing credit to stop scammers from opening fraudulent accounts.

On the social media platform X, Glassnode examines the Realized Cap metric, which records the price at which each coin was last moved and aims to gauge how many holders are in profit or at a loss. The firm points out the monthly percent change in realized cap for each of the three assets. “This metric acts as an indicator of the rate and direction of capital inflows or outflows for these assets. During the recent market downtrend, the monthly rate of change in Realized Cap for SOL has plunged below both BTC and ETH. This indicates a faster decline in momentum for Solana compared to the other two assets. Current monthly Realized Cap Change (%/30D): • BTC: +10.87% • ETH: +5.43% • SOL: +2.19%.” Source: Glassnode/X But Glassnode noted earlier this week that Solana has maintained a positive net capital inflow since early September 2023, with only minor periods of outflow. “This sustained influx of liquidity has assisted in stimulating growth and price appreciation, achieving a remarkable peak inflow of $776 million of new capital per day.” SOL is trading at $186.12 at time of writing.

As the XRP price starts on this trajectory, the WallitIQ (WLTQ) Ripple rival’s staggering leap from $0.0243 to $100 further fuels the race for dominance. With its groundwork laid, the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale presents the next wave of opportunities for proactive investors. The XRP Price Eyes $1,000, But WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) $100 Target Attracts Investors The XRP price is making headlines in an impending revolution in the crypto landscape. According to an insider with strong connections to the XRP price, this altcoin is on an extraordinary path toward a $1,000 valuation in this market cycle. The insider pointed out that the landmark court victory against the SEC earlier this year has set a remarkable pace for the XRP price, establishing momentum like never before. With regulatory clarity affirming its status, the XRP price emerged as a beacon of legitimacy in a market that craves trust. Moreover, the insider’s roadmap reveals that expanding partnerships with major financial institutions is the cornerstone of this ambitious trajectory of the XRP price. According to the insider, the XRP price’s recent integration with the European Central Bank’s digital euro project signals the XRP price rising role as the backbone of global payment infrastructure. However, the fame of the Ripple rival, WallitIQ (WLTQ), has risen over this insider’s lofty projection. For a token valued at $0.0243, a rally to $100 will deliver over a 400,000% rally — a move that will make thousands of investors crypto millionaires. With a total supply of 1 billion tokens, many investors believe WallitIQ (WLTQ) can realistically reach $100, leading to a total market capitalization of $100 billion. In contrast, the insider’s roadmap indicates that the XRP price could attain a staggering $57 trillion market cap upon hitting $1,000. This assumption would be faulty, as a valuation that size is larger than the entire cryptocurrency market. Moreover, investors are keen on the Ripple rival WallitIQ (WLTQ) because 20% of its tokenomics is allocated to rewarding early adopters and active investors. The previous presale stage sold out quickly, and the current stage is now over 90% sold out within just a few days, raising more than $3 million. Investors who have eyes on this Ripple rival have set their sights on a fortune that only decisive action will deliver. As such, they are investing in the WallitIQ (WLTQ) Ripple rival now as the surefire path to financial freedom. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) Innovative Edge In The Crypto Market Any token targeting a 400,000% increase must have expansive innovation to back its ascent. One of WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) extraordinary features is its AI smart suggestions. This tool empowers investors to maximize profitability through strategic portfolio rebalancing and insights into optimal trading times. Similarly, the provision of learning materials helps investors find the documentation needed to learn the intricacies of DeFi. With this knowledge, investors continue to refine their strategies to stay relevant in the market. Furthermore, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has bolstered investor confidence by completing a smart contract audit with SolidProof , a leading auditing firm, confirming that WallitIQ (WLTQ) is free from vulnerabilities to malicious attacks. Conclusion The insider’s roadmap paints a promising picture for the XRP price, positioning it to reach $1,000 in this market cycle. However, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is investors’ preferred investment path. As a Ripple rival, this AI coin is poised to thrive amid growing interest in the AI sector. To be part of this wealth creation, investors must realize that they must beat time and thousands of other investors looking to buy WallitIQ (WLTQ) Ripple rival token. In the race, fortune favors only the swift and decisive who buy WallitIQ (WLTQ) now at $0.0243 .

33767162,[object Object],1735419639,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Dogecoin Price Reaches An RSI Of 59 After Dropping To $0.31, Here’s What Happened The Last Time",https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-price-rsi-of-59-0-31/,"The Dogecoin price has continued its decline over the past two weeks into the last 24 hours. Particularly, Dogecoin has yet to start a notable momentum above the $0.30 threshold, although it has largely held up above $0.31 . Amidst this price decline, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator has relayed a similar decline, which was noted on social media platform X by crypto analyst KrissPax. He points to Dogecoin’s RSI reaching 59, a level associated with bullish potential in the current market cycle. Dogecoin RSI At 59: Historical Context According to crypto analyst KrissPax on social media platform X , Dogecoin’s RSI at 59 is a key technical signal. Notably, the technical analysis is based on the Dogecoin weekly timeframe chart. According to the chart, Dogecoin’s weekly RSI has been in a downward trajectory since early December, following a peak above 90. During this time, the meme coin was under extreme buying pressure, leading to overbought conditions. From here, Dogecoin experienced a sharp decline in the RSI triggered by intense selling pressure from holders , which caused Dogecoin’s price to drop significantly. The correction pushed the RSI below the 70 and 60 levels, reinforcing bearish sentiment during this period. Interestingly, Dogecoin’s weekly RSI has now stabilized at 59 and has been holding around this level since December 16. While this stabilization might suggest a temporary pause in selling pressure, it could also signify something more significant for Dogecoin’s price trajectory. Historical data shared by KrissPax underscores this possibility. The last time Dogecoin’s weekly RSI hovered at 59 was on October 29, when the meme coin was priced at approximately $0.15. What followed was a remarkable rally. Dogecoin’s price surged over the subsequent weeks, culminating in a peak of $0.475. Bullish Breakout Potential Amid Bearish Sentiment Dogecoin’s weekly RSI at 59 suggests that Dogecoin could be gearing up for another surge in the coming weeks. As KrissPax speculated, this suggests that the Dogecoin price could break out from here up to $0.6.However, the unpredictable nature of the crypto market also points to the possibility of a retracement after hitting this peak to cause a retest around $0.45 before resuming its upward trajectory. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.316, and a rally to $0.60 would mark an impressive 90% increase from the current price. Interestingly, Dogecoin has shown resilience at $0.31, bouncing back from this level multiple times over the past 24 hours. However, it has yet to display the strong upward momentum needed to initiate an upward move. If Dogecoin struggles to surpass $0.316, it risks experiencing another short-term decline. In terms of support, $0.31 and $0.30 are the two major levels to keep an eye on. Resistance levels are around $0.33, $0.35, and $0.40.",Altcoin News|Dogecoin|Analyst|crypto|Crypto Analyst|crypto news|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|SEI|JUP|BSV|WLD|APE|HNT|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2024-12-28 21:00:39

While BTC and the altcoin market continue to struggle, Solana memecoin Husky Inu (HINU) generated over $680,000 in its presale. Bitcoin Loses Steam Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) recently reached a high of 60.1% but has declined to around 50%. While a decline in BTC’s dominance was expected, a surge in altcoins was also expected. The past time has, however, revealed that the crypto market at large is losing steam, but top altcoins are stepping up to claim their share of the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin Dominance measures BTC's relative share or dominance in the overall crypto sector. This measure represents the percentage of Bitcoin’s total market cap compared to the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies combined. Bitcoin currently trades for $94,916 – representing a weekly loss of over 2.6%. Dogecoin (DOGE): The OG Memecoin Dogecoin (DOGE), the top memecoin by market cap, exploded after Donald Trump’s victory over Kamala Harris in the US presidential election. DOGE ranks as the 7th largest crypto with a market cap exceeding $47.4 billion, and further gains are expected in the coming months. DOGE quickly rose through the ranks to become a household name in the crypto industry, owing its success to a strong community spurred by the involvement and endorsement of Elon Musk. The tech mogul is the world’s richest man, CEO of Tesla, and owner of social media platform X (formerly Twitter). Musk joined the Trump campaign, playing an integral role in the president-elect’s victory, and his involvement with the party could see DOGE run to new heights as the Trump administration comes into power. DOGE’s value stepped into overdrive after Donald Trump released a statement naming Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy as the leads of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. According to Trump, DOGE will pave the way for his administration to “dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditure, and restructure Federal Agencies – Essential to the “Save America” Movement.” Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) is one of the top-selling memecoins with a market cap exceeding $13 billion. The decentralized community-led token and its reputation as the “Dogecoin Killer” has yielded impressive rewards in the past year, gaining over 108%. SHIB is also a proud member of the Solana network and is Husky Inu’s best friend. The memecoin quickly rose to fame in the crypto industry and has since become a household name. SHIB, launched in 2020, is currently the 14th largest crypto by market cap and the second biggest memecoin after Dogecoin (DOGE). This decentralized, community-led project and its native token, SHIB, quickly gained the attention of its dedicated community of investors thanks to its charm and support from industry giants such as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Husky Inu (HINU) Likely to Benefit on Timing Market onlookers and crypto enthusiasts reacted positively to the end of Gary Gensler’s brutal and belligerent regime. Under Gensler, several large crypto firms and prominent industry figures faced regulatory scrutiny and enforcement action, which drove many to seek refuge off US shores. Donald Trump won the hearts of a large part of the industry with a promise to make the US the world’s crypto capital, and the relief brought by this promise is reflected in current market behaviour. The renewed optimism toward digital assets will likely benefit new projects as investors regain trust and confidence in the industry. Husky Inu (HINU), the latest memecoin sensation from the Solana network, will surely reap the rewards of industry news. Husky Inu recently launched the presale of its native token, HINU , with tremendous success, and the two are on a mission to conquer the memecoin industry through a robust and supportive community with innovative features and enhanced rewards. Since going live, the presale has generated over $686,000, with numbers expected to rise rapidly as the crypto market explodes. Husky Inu is working on some exciting things, including an Earn App and a Decentralized Exchange. The Earn App will reward users with HINU tokens for engaging with the project, and the Decentralized Exchange will facilitate decentralized trading to improve utility and value for HINU holders. Husky Inu boasts several unique features that set it apart from traditional investment opportunities, including a capped token supply, a deflationary mechanism, speedy transactions, and charity voting. Join the HINU presale now to enjoy the immense potential of the burgeoning crypto sector.

The leading crypto asset price has been unstable for the past two weeks, trading sideways. Currently, it is trading at around $95,114, showing a 1.16% drop in just 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap data. Analytics firms are taking notice, with some even predicting a crash might be on the horizon. Bitcoin’s Path Stirs Market Worries Analysts like IT Tech from Cryptoquant have recently pointed out that certain market indicators suggest a shift might be coming soon. One key indicator is Bitcoin’s spot exchange reserves, which had declined for a while but recently increased. In a short time, 20,000 BTC were moved onto exchanges, meaning investors may be getting ready to trade or sell their Bitcoin. This movement can create selling pressure, which could lead to a drop in Bitcoin’s price. Bitcoin’s reserves on exchanges are not just rising; the overall flow of Bitcoin into exchanges has also increased. Recently, 15,800 BTC entered exchanges, reversing the trend of more Bitcoin being withdrawn than deposited. This shift is called a positive netflow, often showing investors preparing to trade or sell their Bitcoin. When reserves go up, and netflows turn positive, investors might plan to take profits or expect Bitcoin’s price to drop soon. These combined signals hint at a possible change in the market. Bitcoin Whales and Retail Traders Shows Caution Alike Bitcoin’s recent market trends do not just reflect the actions of retail traders. Bitcoin whale holders are also making moves . Over the past week, the amount of Bitcoin these whales sent to exchanges increased significantly, with the exchange netflow rising from -0.04% to 0.27%. This means more of their Bitcoin is being moved onto exchanges. This trend often signals upcoming selling and a shift toward bearish sentiment. What’s Next for Bitcoin? Bitcoin’s NVT (Network Value to Transaction) ratio is a key indicator to track the asset’s price trajectory. This has recently jumped to a noticeable 1010.02. The NVT ratio measures the relationship between Bitcoin’s market cap and its daily transaction volume. A spike in the NVT ratio means Bitcoin’s price is rising faster than network usage. This often signals a price correction ahead as the market realigns. With these signs of caution, Bitcoin’s short-term outlook is uncertain. If reserves keep rising and netflows remain positive, the market could see more volatility and selling pressure, possibly lowering Bitcoin’s price. Support levels are crucial. If Bitcoin drops below $92,700, it could fall to $86,000. Market sentiment is changing, and a correction may be near. Investors are advised to watch closely for potential volatility ahead.

38240455,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634362,1735420504,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38240455.jpeg,Will the U.S. adopt Bitcoin as a strategic asset for real?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/will-u-s-adopt-bitcoin-as-a-strategic-asset/,"As the debate over Bitcoin’s role in global finance intensifies, questions emerge on whether the United States would adopt it as a strategic asset. Others believe that Bitcoin will eventually replace traditional reserve systems, but according to Ki Young Ju, the U.S. is far from embracing such a shift given its economic dominance and reliance on the dollar. Recently, the idea of the United States adopting Bitcoin as a strategic asset has come forward, but not everybody agrees that it will happen soon. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju joined the discussion on the U.S. introducing Bitcoin into its financial plan. Ju said gold has often been presented as a solution whenever the United States felt threatened by a loss of global economic dominance. The gold price has risen as uncertainty has surrounded the U.S. economy, and the debate about going back to the gold standard never really subsided. In the 1990s, Peter Schiff argued that gold is the “true form of money,” and today, Bitcoin advocates claim that Bitcoin can replace all other forms of money. These advocates see Bitcoin as a way to achieve financial freedom and global economic stability. Despite some calls to bring back the gold standard, no effort has succeeded in doing so in the United States. Instead, the U.S. has always found other ways to handle crises and keep growing. Bitcoin is taking the place gold once held in people’s minds. According to Ki Young Ju, the future of finance is unlikely to see Bitcoin as an important player in the immediate future, though it may one day become a strategic asset for the U.S. In other words, serious consideration by the U.S. as a reserve asset will depend on a real threat to its global economic supremacy. U.S. dollar’s dominance in global trade Despite the changing global economy, the U.S. stands strong, and the dollar remains the first choice of international trade. Though, at the same time, it is possible that the U.S. may be using Bitcoin as a sort of backup for the dollar or to gain economic benefit, Ju points out that the reasons behind such a step would likely be very far from what Bitcoin supporters could imagine. Ju’s skepticism towards the U.S. adopting Bitcoin as a strategic asset is mainly because the country still relies on the dollar. With capital flowing to the U.S. from anywhere worldwide, money is still pouring into dollar accounts. This is even as Bitcoin and other so-called cryptocurrencies rise to unparalleled heights, and many folks see the dollar as at least a better store of value than all of that stuff. Examples are countries such as South Korea, which for years have been opting to store U.S. dollars instead of Bitcoin or gold as their currencies, the Korean won, continue to decline. This proves that at least the U.S. dollar will remain a reserve currency for the future. However, there are emerging voices across the U.S. calling for a course change in its monetary policy, and even President-elect Donald Trump has been quoted as supporting Bitcoin, with public statements made valuing the virtual currency during his presidential run. As Ju points out, things could change, especially with bigger policy issues ahead. The U.S. might still buy Bitcoin to strengthen its economy or manage risks. However, Ju believes it’s unlikely that the U.S. will treat Bitcoin as a core reserve asset, as some Bitcoin supporters hope. Instead, he would be far more concerned with the diversification of schemes rather than considering Bitcoin a core base of the financial systems of the government. Ju’s analysis holds true for the fact that most governments have yet to adopt Bitcoin. While nations like El Salvador and Bhutan have adopted Bitcoin within their respective economies, nations like Japan could not consider Bitcoin to be added as a national reserve. Instead, Japan has strengthened its economy by using more traditional approaches than risking its exploration with Bitcoin. This is because it cannot take a risk with the volatility of Bitcoin and the uncertainty it carries as to its long-term value as a stable asset. Companies lead Bitcoin adoption On the other hand, private companies have been much faster in adapting to the idea of Bitcoin in their financial strategy. Big firms such as MicroStrategy, MARA Holdings, and RIOT Platforms continue to buy Bitcoin steadily. These companies buy Bitcoin to hedge against inflation and to diversify their investments. These firms have steadily accumulated substantial Bitcoin holdings, reflecting a growing shift in how institutional investors perceive and value cryptocurrency as a key asset. Companies such as Metaplanet, for instance, recently bought more than 600 Bitcoin, adding to their reserves, now at almost 1,800 BTC. This is why more people in private firms may embrace it, but the U.S. government is more hesitant. The U.S. may look into a reserve of Bitcoin in the long run. Still, it will remain one of the assets that the individual investors and companies would hold onto rather than a vital component of the U.S. government’s financial plan. Though the surge in popularity and adoption of Bitcoin is undeniable, it appears that the U.S. will not immediately make Bitcoin a strategic asset. The dollar remains dominant and the U.S. holds a strong position in the global economy, making it hard to argue for an immediate shift towards Bitcoin as a reserve asset. However, as the maturing of the cryptocurrency market and more institutions and private firms invest in Bitcoin, the U.S. government might reassess its position. For now, Bitcoin is a niche asset and not a mainstream reserve currency for the U.S. Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",Bitcoin News & Insights|BTC|USA,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-28 21:15:04

As 2025 approaches, these cryptos are at the forefront, transforming decentralized finance, smart contracts, and cross-border payments. But choosing from thousands of options can be daunting. It requires a smart approach to decide which cryptos to add to one's portfolio, regardless of one's familiarity with the cryptocurrency sphere. This guide highlights the top altcoins to consider by 2025, including Stellar (XLM), BlockDAG (BDAG), Chainlink (LINK), Avalanche (AVAX), and Ripple (XRP). So, let’s explore the key reasons these cryptos are the best choices. BlockDAG: World’s Most Advanced Blockchain Crypto BlockDAG (BDAG) leads the list as a pioneering layer-1 blockchain project, with its successful presale, which has already amassed over $173 million, making it one of the most-discussed new crypto projects. Currently, in its 26th batch, BlockDAG’s native coin BDAG is priced at $0.0234, offering early participants a 2240% ROI. Market experts suggest the coin could rise to $1 by 2025. Crypto enthusiasts are currently snapping up BDAG coins, taking advantage of its substantial BDAG400 bonus, starting at 250%. BlockDAG’s innovative structure uses Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology, enabling faster transactions, unmatched scalability, and lower costs than traditional blockchains. BlockDAG also offers an efficient, secure system for its miners that lowers energy use without compromising security. With a range of mining rigs from the X1 mobile app to the more advanced X10, X30, and X100, BlockDAG supports eco-friendly mining for both experienced and new miners. By filling the gaps left by current crypto solutions, BlockDAG proves to be a prime choice for both miners and buyers, offering promising returns and standout functionality, making it the top altcoin to buy now. Stellar (XLM): Streamlining Global Payments Stellar (XLM) continues to expand its blockchain ecosystem through partnerships with Paxos and Etherfuse. Known for quick transactions, low fees, multi-currency support, and a decentralized exchange, Stellar is set to improve cross-border payments. Currently priced around $0.3881, XLM is gaining traction among the top altcoins to buy now. Experts foresee a potential price rise in 2025 as Stellar’s network becomes known for efficient and accessible financial solutions, confirming its place among the top altcoins to consider for 2025. Chainlink (LINK): Secure Oracle Integration Chainlink is advancing by teaming up with entities such as Banco Inter and Microsoft to boost trade finance. Its latest venture into the zkSync ecosystem with a cross-chain interoperability protocol underscores its dedication to advancing technology, even during slow market periods. Key features of Chainlink include decentralized oracles, secure data feeds, and hybrid smart contracts that connect blockchain technology with practical, real-world data applications. These innovations position LINK as among the top altcoins crypto for 2025. Currently, LINK is priced at about $24.82, and it is anticipated to experience further growth in 2025 due to its increasing usage. Avalanche (AVAX): Rapid & Low-Cost Transactions Avalanche has seen significant developments with its latest updates, like the Avalanche9000 mainnet upgrade that cut fees by more than 90% and secured $250 million for its Layer-1 improvement. Its main attributes are high throughput, low latency, customizable subnets, and compatibility with Ethereum. Priced around $40.95 now, AVAX may witness growth in 2025 as its growing ecosystem and collaborations continue to boost its presence in DeFi and business applications, making it a considerable option among the top altcoins for 2025. Ripple (XRP): Fast Financial Bridging XRP has experienced variability in a fluctuating market, with a current price of around $2.29. Recent updates show a potential positive shift in regulatory perspective with the likely resolution of the SEC lawsuit, enhancing confidence in the crypto. XRP is characterized by quick transactions, low costs, and a distinctive consensus algorithm on the decentralized XRP Ledger. Its capability for handling scalability and cross-border payments via RippleNet makes XRP a preferred choice for global financial bodies. It is projected to see steady growth in 2025, marking it as one of the top altcoins to buy now . Summing Up the Top Altcoins for 2025 While Stellar, Chainlink, Avalanche, and Ripple all show strong potential, BlockDAG sets itself apart with its innovative technology and focus on environmental sustainability. Its blockchain technology facilitates swift transactions and addresses ongoing issues like scalability and energy efficiency. With its presale already garnering over $173 million and aiming for a $600 million goal, BlockDAG is establishing itself as the leading pick for those seeking the top altcoin for 2025.

With Hyperliquid, Solana, and Rollblock as some of the top options, those early retirement plans could turn into reality. HYPE showcases potential in decentralized finance, SOL continues to lead with its high-speed blockchain, and the new crypto RBLK is maxing out on a niche in web3 applications. This article explores why these projects could be pivotal for achieving life-changing returns in 2025. Rollblock Offers More Than 150 Profit Opportunities Rollblock merges blockchain technology with online gaming, creating a decentralized ecosystem powered by the RBLK token. The platform offers users access to games and a transparent rewards system. By leveraging blockchain’s speed and security, Rollblockensures seamless transactions and eliminates traditional barriers in online gambling. A weekly revenue-sharing model also sets Rollblock further apart. Users who stake RBLK earn a share of the platform’s weekly earnings, directly linking participation to financial returns. This model encourages user involvement and provides a consistent stream of rewards. Notably, Rollblock enhances its utility through staking bonuses of up to 30% APY and cashback rewards. To maintain token value, Rollblock integrates deflationary mechanisms such as buybacks and burns, reducing the circulating supply of RBLK over time. This approach balances demand and supply, driving long-term value appreciation. With over 150 games in its arsenal, Rollblock can easily capitalize on the hype of the iGaming industry. HYPE Hits 1,050% Price Increase in Just 25 Days Hyperliquid (HYPE) broke records in 2024 with a 1,050% price increase just 25 days after its listing on CoinMarketCap. Just like its price, HYPE’s trading volume and user adoption keep hitting new highs. Analysts are yet to figure out its price ceiling as HYPE’s price is forecasted to rise by 240% by January 25, 2025. HYPE’s unique mechanism for pooling liquidity across decentralized exchanges gives it a significant edge in the DeFi market. Its integration of AI-driven market-making and automated yield strategies enhances efficiency for traders and liquidity providers. With over $8.2 billion in market cap, HYPE could enter the top 20 cryptocurrencies in early 2025. Analysts Predict SOL Breakout Above $221 Solana (SOL) is not left out of the record-breaking. This year, SOL outperformed its biggest competitor, ETH, in on-chain activities and percentage increase in capital. With Solana’s layer-2 blockchain Sonic airdropping to select users, SOL is forecasted to retest the resistance at $198 and even cross $221 by January end. Moreover, SOL’s staking rewards and developer-friendly infrastructure continue to attract institutional and retail interest alike. With speculations of a Solana ETF approval in 2025, analysts see the potential for SOL to break its previous all-time high, making it a key asset to watch. Conclusion While SOL and HYPE have the potential to skyrocket in 2025, Rollblock provides better returns on investment as a new crypto. Through its ongoing presale, RBLK is valued at a generous rate of $0.044 each.

Although price action says otherwise, this confidence is highlighted through various predictions from crypto analysts on social media and on TradingView, which cuts across various cryptocurrencies. Amidst the price decline and market optimism, the Crypto Market Fear and Greed Index continues to point to greed, which leans toward the idea of a momentary dip before a broader recovery. Bitcoin Price Crash Stalls Bullish Momentum The crypto industry has largely exhibited bullish momentum throughout 2024, with many cryptocurrencies reaching new multi-year highs. This momentum was led by Bitcoin, which broke through its 2021 all-time high of $69,000 in the middle of 2024 to eventually break above the $100,000 psychological level for the first time on December 5. Related Reading: Historical Data Shows What To Expect From Ethereum Price In Q1 2025 – It’s Very Bullish However, Bitcoin’s price action since crossing over the six-digit price threshold has been mostly full of corrections. Although it peaked at $108,135 on December 17, the past 12 days or so have been highlighted by price declines. Notably, Bitcoin has corrected as low as $92,600 in the past seven days, essentially leading to a cascade of declines among other cryptocurrencies and stalling the bullish momentum. Bitcoin’s descent has surprised many crypto traders, considering its strong rally in recent months. Analysts attribute this correction to profit-taking by a few long-term holders and a temporary slowdown in market activity. Crypto Market Sentiment Stays In Greed Despite recent price declines, HODLing trends suggest that the cryptocurrency market remains on track to sustain its rally into 2025. This sentiment is reflected in the Fear and Greed Index, which continues to hover in the greed zone, signaling confidence among investors. The index is derived from a combination of key metrics, including market volatility, trading volume, social media sentiment, Bitcoin dominance, Google search trends, and surveys. Each component is carefully weighted to gauge the market’s psychological state. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Retests Support Line After Crash Below $95,000, Here’s The Next Target At the time of writing, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index, according to alternative.me, is at a reading of 72, which is in the Greed threshold. This relays investor confidence across the various market indicators and suggests that traders perceive the dip as a buying opportunity rather than a cause for panic. This greed sentiment is relayed through a few buying trends across notable cryptocurrencies. For example, on-chain data from crypto analytics company Santiment shows that Dogecoin whales have bought over 90 million DOGE tokens in the past 48 hours. With this in mind, analysts are optimistic about a broader market recovery in the coming weeks. Technical indicators point to a rebound led by Bitcoin if it can continue to hold above support levels around $92,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $94,400 and is down by 12.8% since it reached $108,135 on December 17. According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, such corrections (between 20% and 30%) are the best thing to always happen to Bitcoin in every bull cycle.

Homosexual Pepe (HOMOPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homosexual Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homosexual Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Homosexual Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homosexual Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homosexual Pepe by entering its contract address – 92xPeBxtanptFH9AYsRtwRMq7cWWw9GHfxaspwpNvCTP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-28 21:46:46
38241539,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634381,1735422636,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38241539.jpeg,US Treasury to hit new debt ceiling before Trump’s inauguration as the crisis worsens,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/us-treasury-to-hit-new-debt-ceiling-before-trumps-inauguration-as-the-crisis-worsens/,"The United States is staring down the barrel of another financial crisis, with the Treasury Department confirming it will hit a new debt ceiling just days before Donald Trump returns to the White House. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen sent a warning to Congress, saying the debt limit will reset to match the current $36 trillion in national debt on January 2, 2025. A small $54 billion reduction in federal trust fund securities will provide a sliver of breathing room, but that will disappear fast. By mid-January, the Treasury will be forced to use “extraordinary measures” to keep the government’s lights on. Yellen’s message was that lawmakers must act to raise or eliminate the debt ceiling, or the U.S. will face financial disaster. “I respectfully urge Congress to act to protect the full faith and credit of the United States,” she wrote. But with a politically divided Capitol and tensions rising, the solution is far from clear. Interest payments are swallowing the budget If the growing national debt was a fire, interest payments would be the gasoline. In the past year alone, the U.S. spent $1.15 trillion on interest payments alone. To put it plainly, that’s more than the country spent on defense and healthcare combined—by $300 billion. Interest costs have doubled in just three years, and they’re climbing fast. At this rate, interest payments will overtake Social Security as the government’s biggest expense in the next three years. The Treasury is now America’s biggest borrower, but even it can’t keep up with the Federal Reserve’s relentless high rates. Without congressional action, the U.S. will hit its borrowing cap by January 14 to 23. After that, the government won’t be able to issue new debt, leaving it incapable of paying its bills. Federal programs like Social Security, Medicare, and even military operations could face massive funding cuts. Trump calls for a radical fix Trump broke with Republican tradition by backing the idea of eliminating the debt ceiling altogether. In his words: “The Democrats have said they want to get rid of it. If they want to get rid of it, I would lead the charge.” Trump pushed for Congress to include a debt ceiling provision in its end-of-year funding bill, threatening primary challenges against Republicans who opposed him. But despite his influence, 170 Republicans defied him, leaving the debt ceiling fight for his incoming administration. The divide in Washington is as sharp as ever. Democrats argue that the debt ceiling is an outdated tool that only creates unnecessary crises. Republicans, on the other hand, see it as a bargaining chip to rein in government spending. Trump has blurred the lines, creating new tensions within his own party. The economic fallout The timing couldn’t be worse. The U.S. economy is already grappling with rising inflation, high interest rates, and slowing growth. GDP is projected to grow by 2.7% this year, but that’s expected to drop to 1.7% by 2026. Consumer spending, the backbone of the economy, has slowed to a crawl. In October, spending rose by just 0.1% month-over-month, a drop from the stronger gains earlier this year. Unemployment is creeping up too, now sitting at 4.25%. Companies are cutting back on hiring, and wage growth is slowing. The labor force participation rate is declining, leaving more Americans out of work or underemployed. Even consumer confidence is tanking. The Consumer Confidence Index fell by 8.1 points in December, signaling that Americans are increasingly pessimistic about the economy. Inflation, while stabilizing at around 2.3%, is still eating into household savings. Personal income rose by just 0.3% in November, and the savings rate is now at a meager 4.4%.

Recent Tron (TRX) news underscores breakthroughs in AI technology, while Sui market analysis indicates a promising future for sustained growth. Moreover, the partnership between BlockDAG Network and Inter Milan aims to broaden its already extensive community of over 170,000 holders by integrating blockchain with global sports platforms. These developments highlight varied strategies and underline the significant impact of visibility and adoption in propelling the crypto sector forward. From Tron’s initiatives in streamlining process creation to the broadening applications of Sui and the notable milestones achieved by BlockDAG’s presale, each project sheds light on critical aspects of the blockchain environment. For those keen on the market dynamics, BlockDAG (BDAG) stands out as a primary crypto coin to monitor closely into 2025. Tron News: Launch of AI-Driven Features The latest Tron news reveals the introduction of its inaugural AI agent on the Sun Pump platform, a pivotal development that allows for the automated generation and real-time modification of process parameters. This update, along with Tron’s collaboration with Bitget, a top cryptocurrency exchange, marks an essential phase in expanding its network’s ecosystem. This integration with AI technology is designed to simplify process creation and elevate user experiences, enhancing both usability and reliability through unique identifiers for each process. Following these updates, TRX has seen a significant uptick in its market value, reaffirming its current relevance and potential growth. Sui Market Analysis: Poised to Challenge Top Contenders Recent Sui market analysis points to the potential of this blockchain to soon contend with major cryptocurrency players. Despite fluctuations in price, Sui has shown considerable growth this past year, with its total value locked significantly increasing since September. The use of the Move programming language is a key factor simplifying development on the Sui platform. The analysis of Sui’s market also highlights robust fundamentals, including escalating adoption rates and strategic partnerships, such as those with USDC and Revolut. Despite the volatile price trends, many in the trading community view Sui as possibly undervalued. Given its strong developer support and expanding practical applications, forecasts suggest Sui is on track for considerable expansion in the upcoming year. BlockDAG’s Alliance with Inter Milan Elevates Global Crypto Visibility The collaboration between BlockDAG and the iconic Italian soccer team Inter Milan has made BlockDAG a highly anticipated crypto coin to watch . This partnership has greatly increased visibility, introducing BlockDAG’s advanced blockchain technology and its potential for substantial growth to millions of soccer enthusiasts globally. Analysts anticipate that this collaboration will boost the ongoing presale of BlockDAG, which has already achieved significant outcomes. The network has successfully raised over $173 million and distributed over 17.5 billion coins to date. Presently, during presale Batch 26, the price of BDAG is at $0.0234. Early participants have realized a ROI of 2240%, underscoring the project’s promising future. BlockDAG’s utilization of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology facilitates quick, scalable, and secure transactions, distinguishing it as a frontrunner in blockchain technology. The network’s versatility extends across DeFi, gaming, and NFT sectors, providing a broad platform for developers and traders. This multimillion-dollar agreement with Inter Milan provides unique, blockchain-enhanced engagement opportunities for fans and additional benefits for BDAG holders, enhancing the appeal and success of the presale. This partnership merges cutting-edge blockchain technology with a globally renowned sports brand, enhancing overall adoption and interest among traders. In the upcoming weeks, it is anticipated to increase BlockDAG’s community of 170,000 holders, further cementing its position in the crypto presale market. Key Crypto Coins to Monitor: A Year-End Review As the year draws to a close, Tron (TRX) news, Sui market analysis, and BlockDAG’s strategic alliances emphasize the advanced power of blockchain, marking them as the top crypto coins to watch currently. Tron’s enhancements in AI technology have streamlined process creation, improving user experiences and indicating continuous advancements within the network. Sui market analysis highlights its consistent growth and extended collaborations, showcasing its strong potential within the blockchain arena. Moreover, BlockDAG’s partnership with Inter Milan not only magnifies its presale achievements and global presence but also integrates BlockDAG into the lives of millions of soccer fans, expanding its reach and influence.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $16.21 by the end of 2027. By 2030, WIF’s price may surge to $23.65. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance, and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to a crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins expected to hit the market soon. Having closed in on the $5 mark on March 31, 2024, and also recaptured $4 post-U.S. elections in November, can WIF reach $10 soon? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $1.908 Market cap $1,904,301,106.83 Trading volume $235,805,446.55 Circulating supply 998,844,741.24 WIF All-time high $4.85 on March 31, 2024 All-time low $0.0677 on January 8, 2024 24-hour high $1.96 24-hour low $1.80 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Prediction $6.42 (232.15%) Volatility (30-day Variation) 20.80% 50-day SMA $2.97 14-Day RSI 33.01 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 72 (Greed) Green days 12/30 (40%) 200-Day SMA $2.31 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis: Will WIF recapture $2 soon? TL;DR Breakdown WIF’s price analysis shows consolidation with tightening Bollinger Bands in the short time. Dogwifhat (WIF) resistance is present at around $1.977. WIF’s support level is present at $1.777. The Dogwifhat price analysis for December 28 shows a slight recovery from intense bear pressure. Despite the 4% gain in the past few hours, the possibility of further downsides still looms. WIF shows signs of recovery, with a 0.86% gain in 7 days. However, the 30-day price dynamics show a 37.788% price drop. Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart: WIF shows slight recovery but remains below SMA The 1-day price analysis for WIF shows a slight recovery, with the price currently at $1.908, up 4.43%. While the increase is notable, the token remains below the key $1.950 SMA, suggesting the broader trend is still under pressure. WIF shows slight recovery but remains below SMA The RSI at 33.99 signals oversold conditions, indicating that the price may see additional upward momentum as buyers step in. The MACD remains bearish, with the histogram showing limited improvement. Combining these indicators suggests that the current upward movement may be limited unless stronger buying momentum develops. If WIF can break above $1.950, it could signal a stronger recovery, potentially pushing toward $2.00. Conversely, failure to maintain the current momentum may lead to a retest of support around $1.800. Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart: Indicators point to short-term bullish strength, but bears still maintain control The 4-hour price analysis for Dogwifhat (WIF) indicates mild consolidation. The Bollinger Bands show narrowing, with the upper band at $1.977 and the lower band at $1.777, signaling reduced volatility and potential for a breakout. WIF indicators point to short-term bullish strength, but bears still maintain control The price is trading slightly above the basis line at $1.877, indicating some short-term bullish strength. However, the Balance of Power (BoP) at -0.33 reflects that sellers are still maintaining a degree of control in the market. If WIF can break above the $1.977 resistance level, it could trigger a more decisive upward move. On the downside, a dip below $1.877 could push the price toward the lower Bollinger Band at $1.777, where stronger support is expected. Dogwifhat technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 2.35 SELL SMA 5 2.27 SELL SMA 10 2.18 SELL SMA 21 2.63 SELL SMA 50 2.97 SELL SMA 100 2.65 SELL SMA 200 2.31 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 2.26 SELL EMA 5 2.42 SELL EMA 10 2.66 SELL EMA 21 2.89 SELL EMA 50 2.91 SELL EMA 100 2.71 SELL EMA 200 2.47 SELL What to expect from WIF price analysis? If WIF breaks above $1.977, we could see a stronger recovery toward $2.00 or higher. However, failure to hold the $1.877 support could lead to a deeper pullback toward $1.777, aligning with bearish trends on the daily chart. Is Dogwifhat a good investment? Dogwifhat has experienced notable price fluctuations, particularly with a substantial increase in value in March, July, and October/November of 2024. While analysts hold diverse opinions on the future of this meme coin, the prevailing sentiment is optimistic. Projections indicate that by 2030, the price could rise to between $15 and $20. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank and several others. Why is $WIF down? After rebounding at $4.0013 due to price corrections, WIF is currently trading between $1.80 and $1.96. The current decline suggests that WIF is experiencing bearish momentum. Will WIF reach $10? Having touched $4.67 in November 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Analyst predictions suggest the token could surpass $10 as soon as 2026. Will WIF reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and would require exceptional growth, widespread adoption, and wild market speculation. Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $7 by 2025 and $20 by 2030. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

In its Anti-Scam Refund Initiative end-of-year report, the company outlined how it deployed cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies to transform digital asset security from reactive measures to proactive defense strategies. Anti-Scam Initiative According to the report , on average, the company processed about 80 successful fund recoveries monthly, totaling to about $9 million of stolen funds returned to victims in 2024. Additionally, it revealed that it made over 30,000 phone calls to warn potential targets of likely scams, with at least 15,000 alerts issued daily to platform users. The initiative’s efforts resulted in no less than 47,000 malicious addresses being blacklisted and, as of November, more than $129 million in annual funds prevented from being swindled. The key to Binance’s approach to stopping bad actors from stealing from its user base is a system that combines technological surveillance and human-centered support. In it, machine learning algorithms analyze complex transaction patterns in real-time, identifying potential criminal activities at super-fast speeds. It also employs AI-powered behavioral profiling to distinguish between legitimate user activity and potential illegal undertakings. The firm reported that it developed more than 50 specialized models and implemented 14 major upgrades to outmaneuver the fraudsters’ increasingly sophisticated tactics. Its Anti-Scam Refund Initiative operates through four pillars: proactive protection, 24-hour safety mechanisms, rapid response recovery, and support for silent victims. The one-day safety net allows users a cooling period for suspicious transactions, with funds moved to flagged accounts frozen to provide an opportunity for investigations and potential intervention. Binance’s Wins Over Crypto Thieves Since the beginning of the year, CryptoPotato has reported several incidents in which Binance’s intervention helped cryptocurrency users recover stolen funds. For instance, in October, the company aided Delhi police in taking down a digital asset scam ring in the city and recovering up to 100,000 USDT. Earlier in September, the exchange’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) helped authorities in the same country crack a scheme in which user funds amounting to $47.6 million were stolen from an online gaming platform and siphoned into several digital wallets. In August, the company announced that its risk management system had prevented more than $2.4 billion in losses from potential swindlers in the first half of 2024. About $1.1 billion of this was attributed to suspected criminal withdrawals, with another $73 million previously frozen due to external hacks.

Investments will focus on Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions, blockchain infrastructure, AI blockchain, DeFi, Web3, privacy, and tokenization. Robert Lay, the head of PitchBook, shared his expectations for crypto projects venture capital funding in 2025 in a recent interview with CNBC’s Crypto World . Although the year 2024 has been challenging, with a decrease in funding due to various reasons, such as the collapse of major players and higher interest rates, Lay remains optimistic about the industry’s future. Reflecting on 2024, Lay said the year started strong with good funding, especially after approving a Bitcoin ETF. That renewed positive sentiment brought venture capital back into the space. However, crypto investment momentum slowed as the year progressed. “Bitcoin kind of staggered a little bit, and there wasn’t a lot of activity, especially through the summer,” Lay said, adding that the 2024 venture capital amount will come in between $11 billion and $12 billion as projected, a 10 to 20 percent surge above the 2023 mark but still far less than what the world had hoped for going forward. Crypto VC funding expected to grow in 2025 Lay turns his focus to 2025 and is optimistic because the fundamentals are strong for this crypto market. Bitcoin had already touched all-time high numbers, and a more liberalizing regulatory environment was popping out of the woodwork. He also indicated that interest rates, although high , are likely to fall and thus further improve the investors’ outlook. “We’re expecting next year to be much stronger,” he stated, p redicting that VC funding for crypto could rise to $18 billion or more in 2025, representing an increase compared to 2024. Although this figure would still fall short of the nearly $30 billion invested in 2021 and 2022, it signals a clear rebound in interest and investment. The generalist investors have been relatively absent in recent years. Lay mentions that this group is back, and large financial institutions have a major role to play in this shift, along with close coordination with regulators to establish a more stable and credible environment for crypto. As the involvement from these institutions builds , the levels of trust within crypto should increase, resulting in additional dollars transferred into the ecosystem. When questioned on which areas crypto VC funding might focus on during 2025, Lay mentioned that, unlike during the last cycle, much attention was paid toward infrastructure and speculative sectors, including NFTs and Web3. Focus on r eal-world apps predicted to rise In contrast, during the following cycle, things may tilt toward applications. Lay noted that we expect to see more investments at the application layer. This means the focus will shift from infrastructure to real-world, user-friendly applications. S uch applications could be in industries where crypto infrastructure decentralizes traditional systems, such as mobility or energy data. Lay stressed that what’s lacking is more user-friendly platforms that allow people to get into crypto without having a deep understanding of the underlying technology. He compares it to the early internet days when infrastructure like AWS was set up, but the real value came when companies like Uber and Airbnb built on it. “In crypto, the real value will come from the applications, not just the infrastructure,” he said, pointing out the potential for real-world use and growth. A project that received major attention in 2024 is the development of Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions, which may help scale Bitcoin and make it more useful for everyday applications. Although there was much excitement early in the year, that progress has slowed, and technical challenges have hindered the development of scalable solutions. The development has been slower than anticipated, and whether Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions will come up to the mark is yet to be seen. Better regulations expected in 2025 When asked about the role of regulation in shaping the future of crypto, Lay acknowledged that though the regulatory environment remains a major concern, the situation has improved from previous years. He believed that if no new legislation is approved in the United States for 2025, that is enough , just having less restrictive rules from the legislator side . If more detailed legislation, such as a bill on stablecoin, enters into force, that will be a tremendous lift to the industry. “If Congress does nothing, I think that’s already a benefit compared to the last two years,” Lay concluded.

A chart shared by the analyst on X illustrates XRP’s current consolidation phase. It shows a bullish pattern that often precedes a breakout. The chart captures XRP trading in a descending triangle pattern following its substantial rally in November that sent it to its highest level since 2018. CryptoBull suggests that “the longer the consolidation, the stronger the move up,” implying that the asset’s price could surge soon. This aligns with the historical behavior of cryptocurrencies, where extended consolidation phases often result in explosive moves. The chart also showed how two brief consolidation periods helped XRP reach this peak of $2.86, and the extended consolidation following that could lead to a much larger price increase. #XRP will go up soon. The longer the consolidation, the stronger the move up pic.twitter.com/OcClBNdqrL — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) December 26, 2024 Potential Targets for XRP CryptoBull has been optimistic about XRP’s trajectory in the past. In a recent analysis, he projected that XRP could reach a new all-time high within two weeks . That analysis also emphasized that the ongoing consolidation phase is critical, serving as a foundation for the asset’s next upward move. CryptoBull noted that the digital asset has reached its bottom for the current run, and showed a similar consolidation triangle that would cause the surge in under two weeks. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Further, CryptoBull has outlined a potential path for XRP to hit $6 . He argues that XRP is completing a correctional pattern, which could set the stage for a sharp price increase. The analyst has previously pointed to XRP’s ability to sustain support levels during market volatility as evidence of its long-term bullish potential. Key Technical Levels and XRP’s Future Based on the shared chart, XRP’s immediate resistance lies near the $2.9 mark, with significant support at the $2 level. A breakout above the triangle’s resistance line could validate CryptoBull’s predictions, potentially driving the price to new heights. CryptoBull’s analysis has sparked interest among XRP investors and traders. His confidence in XRP’s performance is rooted in technical analysis and historical market trends, and many other analysts support the bullish outlook for the digital asset’s immediate future. The digital asset is trading at $2.17, after a minor increase of under 1% in the past 24 hours. However, it might not be here for long, as one analyst recently reiterated a target of $27 with a detailed path to this lofty target.

Prince Elon (ELONPRIN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONPRIN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Prince Elon can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Prince Elon could become the next viral memecoin. Prince Elon launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Prince Elon on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Prince Elon by entering its contract address – 7rAsmWGTtPFY9RFnhd9biard7PrWtw5ZigowwfmaXUQ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONPRIN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-28 22:58:00

Table of Contents Dogecoin’s recent price swings leave investors unsure about its performance in 2025 Cardano mimics 2020 trend that suggests it might surge to $6 Conclusion Irrespective of the industry, the goal of any investment is to make a profit. This is why crypto investors are constantly looking out for the next big altcoin that will yield massive profits. While Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano (ADA) are household names, a new contender, WallitIQ (WLTQ) , is dominating the market because it promises greater returns. Moreover, HSBC analysts believe it will stand out at the start of 2025 by hitting an impressive $10.

This token is rewriting the rules of crypto investing because it uses artificial intelligence to help traders maximize their profit. So, those who are still on the sidelines risk missing the biggest crypto opportunity of the decade. One of the features driving WallitIQ’ s upcoming rise is how it helps people manage their digital assets. This token allows traders to trade over 1,000 cryptocurrencies from the comfort of their wallets. Also, it offers unmatched staking rewards. Users can earn a whopping 180% APY by simply staking their token. HSBC analysts laud WallitIQ as an effortless opportunity to make a juicy passive income. Token holders have governance rights to make their contribution or suggestions towards the platform’s future. The crypto market is already buzzing about WallitIQ’s potential. So, it is no surprise that its presale crossed the million-dollar milestone within days. With other perks like unlimited referral bonuses, community rewards, and ultra-low swap rates, crypto whales are pouring millions into the presale. WallitIQ is selling at $0.0243, and HSBC analysts have predicted it will skyrocket to $10 come January. A major contribution to these projections is that WallitIQ has proven to be a safe and trustworthy platform by completing its smart contracts audit with SolidProof. In other words, WallitIQ helps investors make huge profits and protects their interests while at it. WallitIQ’s presale is currently selling out at lightning speed, and today could be the last chance to grab the token at the low price of $0.0243. Do not let this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity pass by. With WallitIQ, the future of crypto is indeed here, but the big question is — how many will be a part of it? Dogecoin’s recent price swings leave investors unsure about its performance in 2025 Dogecoin has kept many investors on their toes because of its wild price swings. Currently, experts, including HSBC analysts, are uncertain about Dogecoin’s future in 2025. Even Dogecoin’s creator, Billy Markus, was asked about Dogecoin’s potential of an end-of-the-year peak, and his playful response was a “no idea” GIF. This perfectly captures the state of the Dogecoin’s market. Cardano mimics 2020 trend that suggests it might surge to $6 Cardano has captured the attention of crypto enthusiasts as its current price movements seem to mirror its 2020 bull rally pattern. Cardano is currently trading at $0.88 and battling to hold above a key support level of $0.76, a make-or-break point for a Cardano bullish momentum. Additionally, there are comments that Cardano has the potential to surge to $6. Cardano’s 38% increase in Total Value Locked (TVL) and upcoming upgrades like the Plomin hard fork, set to happen in January, are the basis for this sentiment. Conclusion Sometimes, declaring a crypto winner may prove difficult; however, that is not the case with WallitIQ . Although Dogecoin and Cardano have a level of optimism surrounding them, WallitIQ is in a league of its own. HSBC analysts’ prediction of an astronomical rise from $0.0243 to $10 by January 1 is proof of this token’s worth. With WallitIQ’s presale closing soon, this could be the last chance to act fast. Do not hesitate on the biggest crypto opportunity ever. Interested investors should act fast to buy the token now so they can count their fortune in the new year.

Despite multiple upward movements, Bitcoin struggled to break past the $100,000 resistance with its price performance in December continuing to deviate from earlier bullish predictions. Amidst this development, market analysts continue to roll out projections on Bitcoin’s potential price move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Surge: Are Traders Preparing For A Major Market Shift? Is Bitcoin Price Top In? In an X post on December 27, crypto technical analysis handle More Crypto Online shared an interesting prediction on Bitcoin in its current corrective state. Using the Elliott Wave Theory, these market analysts have drafted two opposing forecasts on the BTC market named the yellow and white scenarios. For context, the Elliott Wave Theory is a form of technical analysis that hinges on the belief that the financial market moves in repetitive fractal patterns called waves that can be used to predict future price movements. With Bitcoin presently in a corrective structure i.e. moving against the bullish market trend, the white scenario states Bitcoin has completed a B-wave in which it recorded a local price top on December 26th. Currently, the premier cryptocurrency is moving in a C-wave headed to a potential price target in the mid to low $80,000 price zone. The original support zone to counter this bearish movement is around $95,068 – $96,670. However, as Bitcoin establishes new lows, these resistance regions will be recalibrated. On the other hand, the yellow scenario shows that the B-wave, which is concluded in the white scenario, is still developing as part of a larger corrective structure with no price top yet recorded. However, for this yellow scenario to become valid, BTC needs to break above $96,673 signaling that an upward movement is still ongoing. Therefore, as long as this price zone remains unbroken, the white scenario remains the dominant outlook for the Bitcoin market. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Bull Run Over? What This Legendary Metric Says BTC Price Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $94,790, marking a 1.04% decline over the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, daily trading volume has risen by 10.35%, reaching $52.24 billion. After a week of near-balanced gains and losses, the leading cryptocurrency has dropped 2.00%, with its monthly performance also slipping into negative territory. For market bulls, moving above $96,600 remains the immediate task based on the Elliott Wave theory, however, a major opposition awaits at $100,000 which has proved an effective resistance in recent times. Generally, optimism continues to remain high in the Bitcoin market, especially with the inauguration of US President-elect Donald Trump fast approaching which is expected to herald in a new era of pro-crypto policies.

But what if there’s a superior option to enhance your shopping rewards? Enter the world of Web3Bay’s 3BAY tokens, a groundbreaking reward system poised to revolutionize e-commerce. These tokens surpass traditional gift cards by offering enhanced value, greater flexibility, and more growth opportunities, positioning them as the smarter choice for discerning shoppers today. The live Web3Bay presale presents an early opportunity for participants to secure tokens that provide much more than simple discounts. These tokens allow entry into a decentralized marketplace, offer exclusive advantages, and even grant a stake in the platform’s future, marking the dawn of a new e-commerce era. The Superior Benefits of 3BAY Tokens Enhanced Financial Value Unlike Amazon gift cards that restrict spending to one platform, 3BAY tokens bring unmatched flexibility. These blockchain-enabled tokens can be utilized across Web3Bay’s decentralized marketplace or exchanged on various trading platforms, opening up substantial financial prospects for holders. While gift cards become useless post-use, 3BAY tokens maintain and can even increase in value over time, transforming them from mere rewards into significant assets. Furthermore, Web3Bay’s decentralized structure allows 3BAY tokens to adapt with ongoing innovations in blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi), providing opportunities that go far beyond what traditional gift cards can offer. Unrivaled Discounts and Rewards Web3Bay’s 3BAY tokens are crafted to elevate the shopping experience. Token holders enjoy a 5% discount on every purchase and gain rewards for their participation and engagement with the platform. These benefits accumulate, creating a continual value cycle that Amazon gift cards cannot match. For example, those who take part early in the Web3Bay presale have a unique chance to acquire tokens at a significantly lower price than their eventual final value. As the token price increases by 15% at each presale stage, early buyers experience substantial growth potential. Ownership and Influence in the Platform Web3Bay’s 3BAY tokens extend beyond mere transactional advantages. Token holders play a crucial role in governing the platform, as they can vote on key decisions and shape the direction of the marketplace. This participation ensures that Web3Bay evolves in ways that benefit its community, a stark contrast to Amazon gift cards, which provide no influence over the retailer’s strategies or offerings. Additionally, as Web3Bay transitions into a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), token holders will gain even greater control over the platform’s trajectory, solidifying their position as pivotal stakeholders in the Web3 revolution. Seize the Moment: Join the Web3Bay Presale Now Web3Bay’s presale is a prime opportunity to get 3BAY tokens at a ground-floor price. Launched on December 10, 2024, the presale is laid out over 28 stages, with initial token prices at only $0.003, climbing to $0.1959 in the final stage.

The latest move makes El Salvador the sixth country to hold over 6,000 BTC. The country in Central America bought one Bitcoin on December 29, bringing the country’s total to 6000.77 Bitcoin, which translates to $569.3 million, as shown by the National Bitcoin Office of El Salvador’s portfolio tracker . After the purchase, the country’s Bitcoin investment rose to 108.02%. The Nayib Bukele portfolio tracker further indicates that El Salvador acquired the digital assets at an average purchase price of $45,450 per Bitcoin. The country made its first Bitcoin purchase on September 6, 2021, when it bought 200 Bitcoins. It officially became the first country to declare Bitcoin a legal tender by then. The latest purchase solidifies crypto’s status as a treasury asset for President Nayib Bukele’s country. El Salvador accelerates Bitcoin purchases despite IMF warnings El Salvador ranks sixth among the countries that hold Bitcoin. According to BitBo’s Bitcoin Treasuries data, it falls behind the United States, China, the United Kingdom, Ukraine, and Bhutan. Although the country always buys a Bitcoin per day, it bought $1 million worth one day after striking a $1.4 billion deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and again on December 22, despite the IMF requesting it row back some of its Bitcoin activity. The purchases are in line with El Salvador’s National Bitcoin Office Director Stacy Herbert’s statement on X on December 19, in which he indicated that the country would continue to buy Bitcoin at an accelerated pace. Bitcoin has led to financial freedom in the Central America’s country El Salvador is proud of the achievements associated with Bitcoin since it undertook the mission of stacking digital assets. It recently showcased those achievements in a meeting between Vice President Félix Ulloa Jr. and Zhang Yanhui, the Ambassador of the People’s Republic of China. During the meeting, the Vice President stated that Bitcoin made their country a symbol of financial freedom. He further clarified that the country’s Bitcoin reserve currently exceeds 6,217 BTC, valued at over $500 million.

These groups argue that the IRS has exceeded its legal authority by categorizing DeFi platforms as brokers, sparking backlash across the crypto sector. The IRS recently expanded the definition of ""broker"" to include decentralized exchanges and front-end platforms, requiring them to report all crypto transactions and user details. These rules, set to take effect in 2027, aim to improve transparency in digital asset trading. However, critics argue that the agency’s interpretation goes beyond the scope of its statutory powers and violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) . The advocacy groups claim these regulations create excessive compliance burdens, particularly for software developers building DeFi trading interfaces. They warn this could stifle innovation and push emerging technologies offshore. Marisa Coppel, Head of Legal at the Blockchain Association, stated that the IRS’s move infringes on privacy rights and unfairly targets decentralized technologies. The broader crypto community has also voiced strong opposition. Bill Hughes, a lawyer at Consensys , criticized the timing of the rule's release during the holiday season, suggesting it was a tactic to minimize public resistance. Miles Jennings, General Counsel at a16z Crypto, called the regulation a heavy-handed approach designed to restrict DeFi growth. Additionally, Alexander Grieve, Vice President of Government Affairs at Paradigm, urged Congress to reconsider and potentially block the regulation. Lawmakers, including French Hill and Patrick McHenry, have expressed their disapproval, calling the rule an overstep by the Treasury. Hill described it as a poorly crafted policy finalized in the closing days of the current administration. The lawsuit underscores growing tension between regulators and the crypto industry, highlighting concerns about innovation, privacy, and the future of decentralized finance in the United States .",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-28 23:13:02

With both short-term and long-term projections for 2025, Altura is positioned as a standout project in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency and gaming industries. What is Altura? Altura is a blockchain-based platform that empowers game developers to create and manage in-game items as NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). Unlike traditional gaming assets that are locked within specific games, Altura enables true ownership, allowing players to trade, sell, and use their items across multiple games. This innovation creates a seamless and engaging gaming experience. What makes Altura stand out is its ease of use and efficiency. The platform is designed for developers and gamers alike, making it a preferred choice for integrating blockchain technology into gaming ecosystems. Why Altura is Bullish • Integrating AI: Altura uses artificial intelligence to predict gaming trends, enhance user interactions, and streamline the development process. This integration makes Altura’s platform smarter and more adaptable to the fast-paced gaming industry.• A Hundred-Billion-Dollar Industry: The global gaming market, along with AI, is worth hundreds of billions of dollars and is expected to grow into trillions. By targeting this industry with cutting-edge technology, Altura has positioned itself in one of the most lucrative markets.• NFT Adoption in Gaming: NFTs are becoming increasingly popular in gaming, offering players real ownership of their digital assets. Altura’s focus on gaming NFTs aligns perfectly with this trend, making it a preferred platform for developers and gamers.• Strategic Partnerships: Altura recently partnered with Immutable, integrating advanced tools like Immutable Passport and Checkout to enhance game development and player experiences. This collaboration highlights Altura’s commitment to innovation and growth in the Web3 gaming space.• Supporting Developers: Altura launched a $1 million Web3 Gaming Grant Fund to support game studios and developers. This fund allocates $50,000 each month, fostering creativity and innovation in blockchain gaming.• Potential Exchange Listings: Altura has significant potential to be listed on top-tier exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. With Binance’s 220+ million users and Coinbase’s 100+ million users, such listings could provide immense exposure and liquidity, further boosting Altura’s value. Short-Term Price Prediction for Altura ($ALU) Altura’s price chart shows a falling wedge pattern, a classic bullish signal. The immediate target is $0.20, but with the growing bullish sentiment around its technology and market positioning, the price could exceed $0.50 by Q1 2025. If the altcoin season kicks off in January 2025, Altura’s momentum could gain even more traction. This period often sees rapid market-wide growth, and Altura is well-positioned to capitalize on it. Market Cap and Long-Term Targets for 2025 Altura’s long-term potential is reflected in three clear projections: • Base Target: Altura’s price reaching a $1.5 billion market cap, approximately $1.52 per ALU, is the lowest expected target. This could happen even in a slow or unfavorable market. The project’s solid foundation and consistent innovation mean that Altura can grow despite challenging conditions.• Bullish Target: A $3 billion market cap, translating to about $3.03 per ALU, is highly realistic. This outcome is supported by the growing excitement around AI and gaming and favorable market trends. Altura’s focus on blockchain gaming and NFT adoption positions it perfectly to achieve this target, especially with a potential altcoin season driving momentum.• Ultimate Ambition Target: Altura could achieve a market cap between $5 billion and $10 billion, equating to $5.05 to $10.10 per ALU. This would likely occur during a cryptocurrency super cycle, where Ethereum surpasses $15,000 and Bitcoin trades above $240,000. Such market dynamics, combined with Altura’s positioning in the thriving AI and gaming sectors, could drive unprecedented growth for the project. Conclusion The Bullish Target of $3 billion market cap is very achievable due to the fact that we are still early in the cryptocurrency market. Many leading altcoins, such as Ethereum, are still trading below their previous all-time highs. This suggests that the altcoin season hasn’t even started yet. As a result, reaching a $3 billion market cap for Altura would be a realistic milestone, representing an impressive 3000% increase in value. Why Altura’s Future is Bright Altura stands at the intersection of three powerful trends: gaming, blockchain, and AI. The gaming industry’s rapid expansion, combined with Altura’s innovative use of NFTs and AI, positions it as a key player in this space. With increasing interest from developers, gamers, and investors, Altura is set to achieve remarkable milestones in the coming years. Final Thoughts Altura ($ALU) is a project with immense potential and real-world applications. Whether it’s through short-term growth driven by market patterns or long-term success fueled by its strategic focus, Altura is a cryptocurrency worth watching. With partnerships like Immutable and initiatives like the Web3 Gaming Grant Fund, Altura is setting itself up for success. As we approach 2025, keep an eye on this innovative project—it could be a game-changer in your portfolio. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Meanwhile, Stellar’s technical analysis shows a 29% decline this month, suggesting a continuing downward trend. In the midst of these developments, anticipation around BlockDAG (BDAG) grows following an AMA announcing its 2025 plans to launch on premier exchanges. This news has spiked BDAG demand, with its presale now exceeding $173 million. The journey toward a $600 million presale target appears more feasible, with analysts predicting a BDAG price of $1 by 2025. Let’s delve into how these digital currencies are positioning themselves as the best cryptos to buy now. Stellar’s Outlook: Prolonged Bearish Trends Ahead Stellar’s recent technical analysis indicates a significant 29% fall over the last month. The appearance of a ‘death cross’ could mean the bearish phase isn’t over yet, although a surge in buying might suggest an upcoming reversal. Currently, Stellar finds support at $0.31 and faces resistance at $0.40. The technical charts, including the Directional Movement Index (DMI), point to a strengthening bearish force with an ADX over 25, signaling a strong trend. However, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) index has risen to 0.19, reflecting notable purchasing activity. Should this buying momentum continue, Stellar could potentially breach its current constraints and ascend further. Chainlink’s Pricing Path: Poised for a $32 Breakthrough Despite recent hurdles, Chainlink holds firm support at $21, potentially setting the stage for a push toward the $32 resistance level. A significant amount of LINK has transitioned from exchanges to private storage, hinting at a decrease in sell-off pressure. If Chainlink maintains this foundational support, it may witness an upward trajectory. Growing optimism for Chainlink’s price is evident, with commentary from analyst @Bitcoin_Buddah on X suggesting, “Trump’s World Liberty is actively acquiring LINK, and IMO, Chainlink will spearhead the Altcoin movement in 2025.” Stability is crucial for Chainlink; a fall below support might lower its price further. BlockDAG’s 2025 Exchange Debut Unveiled in the Latest AMA BlockDAG recently stole the spotlight in its December 2024 AMA by announcing substantial development goals. The headline news is BlockDAG’s preparations for major listings in 2025. This AMA shared insights into ongoing discussions with several prominent exchanges, noting a more organized approach to onboarding than before. Aiming to launch on approximately 10 exchanges, this plan positions BlockDAG for swift international growth, boosting its global visibility and making it a top contender as the best crypto to buy now . The buzz from this news has significantly boosted demand for BDAG, prompting a rush for early participation. As the crypto presale surpasses $173 million with prices climbing, daily contributions of over $5 million from major participants indicate a $600 million presale target could soon be a reality. For those eyeing substantial gains, time is of the essence. BDAG’s price is presently $0.0234 in the quickly depleting presale batch 26, with a significant price increase anticipated for the upcoming batch. Adding to the excitement, analysts project that BDAG might reach $1 by the end of 2025. Early participants in BDAG have seen a 2240% ROI, and the projected $1 price points to a possible 4200% ROI for those in batch 26. In brief, entering now might lead to greater gains than delaying and facing higher costs later. The Bottom Line With the Chainlink price steady at $21 and the potential to rise to $32, it presents itself as a robust choice. Meanwhile, the Stellar (XLM) technical analysis after a recent decline suggests a potential upturn if buying intensifies, offering a cautious yet hopeful outlook for market watchers. BlockDAG sets itself apart with its bold plans for 2025 exchange listings. These planned listings are expected to increase global accessibility to BDAG, thereby ramping up demand. With the presale already beyond $173 million and a projected price of $1 by 2025, BlockDAG ranks as one of the best cryptos to buy now.

You’ve just heard of a quirky new token, Turbo (TURBO), hitting Coinbase and skyrocketing in value. You think about investing but hold back. Fast forward a few weeks, and it’s all over crypto news: early adopters are laughing their way to the bank. Now, you’re left wondering, “What if?” Here’s the kicker: history is offering you a redo with BTFD Coin (BTFD) —a presale sensation that’s already raised over $4.5 million and sold 59 billion coins to 6,700+ holders. With a limited festive discount rolling back prices to Stage 7, this could be your chance to make up for missing TURBO’s rocket ride. The question is, are you ready to seize this best new meme coin presale with 50% bonus coins? BTFD Coin: Buy the Festive Dip and Lead the Bulls! The BTFD Coin presale is not just another crypto sale—it’s a movement for those who believe in grabbing opportunities during market chaos. Aptly named after the infamous “ Buy the Dip ” mantra, this token is designed for fearless investors. Launched at $0.000004 per coin, the presale price is now rolled back to Stage 7 ($0.000013), offering an 837% potential ROI when listed at $0.0006 after the presale. But BTFD isn’t just about hype. The project flaunts impressive features, including: A P2E Game: Beta version live since Stage 10. Play, level up, and earn once rewards launch. 90% APY Staking: Staking rewards started on December 2, making it one of the juiciest options for long-term holders. Referral Program: Earn 10% of every referral and climb the leaderboard for exclusive rewards. Community-Driven Power: Led by the “Bulls Squad,” BTFD unites crypto enthusiasts for collective growth. Take this example: If you invest $10,000 at the current presale price ($0.000064), you’d bag 156,250,000 BTFD tokens. Once listed at $0.0006, your stash would be worth a jaw-dropping $93,750. That’s nearly 9x your investment! How to Join the BTFD Presale: Go to the BTFD Presale Page . Connect Your Wallet: Choose MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or another supported wallet. Apply the Code: Enter this “BIG50” code for a festive bonus. Enter Purchase Details: Decide how much BTFD you want. Confirm and Buy: Complete your transaction. With its current momentum, BTFD could dominate the 2025 meme coin space. Don’t wait—secure your dip before January 5, 2025. Turbo (TURBO): The Meme Coin That Got Away Launched as a bold experiment in 2023, Turbo (TURBO) started as a community-driven meme coin with no initial funding. Its meteoric rise was turbocharged when Coinbase listed it, sending the price soaring to $0.00997 at its peak. Despite slight retracements, TURBO still stands as one of the most promising meme coins of recent times. Here’s a quick recap of TURBO’s journey: Initial Hype: The community rallied behind TURBO’s underdog story, pushing its market cap into the hundreds of millions within months. Key Milestones: TURBO got a major boost with its Coinbase listing, increasing liquidity and visibility. Market Performance: Currently priced at ~$0.0089, TURBO remains a high-volatility asset that demands careful timing. Missed TURBO’s early days? You’re not alone. Many hesitated, thinking it was just another meme coin. But those who trusted the process reaped huge rewards, proving that early adoption is key in crypto. While TURBO still holds potential, the question remains: is it worth chasing an asset that’s already made its big leap? Why 2024’s Economic Lessons Make BTFD a Must-Buy If history teaches us anything, it’s that crises breed opportunities. The 1973–74 crash saw markets drop nearly 50%, but savvy investors like Warren Buffett thrived by buying undervalued assets. The same principle applies to meme coins like BTFD. Today, market dips aren’t signs of doom—they’re launchpads. BTFD’s Stage 7 rollback price is the ultimate dip-buying opportunity . Add in the 90% staking APY and P2E game rewards, and you’re looking at a project with both short-term gains and long-term potential. Conclusion: Don’t Let This Best New Meme Coin Presale Slip Away You might’ve missed Turbo’s early rally, but BTFD Coin is here to offer you a second chance at riding the meme coin wave. With its innovative features, strong community, and a presale discount that screams value, BTFD is poised to make headlines in 2025. Don’t sit this one out—head to the BTFD Presale Page , use the code “ BIG50, ” and secure your share before January 5, 2025. This isn’t just another meme coin. It’s a movement.

Trump Cyborg (TRUMPCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCYB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Cyborg launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Cyborg on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Cyborg by entering its contract address – 9yaNQ89EaQ2nEDczZpuTZfDwfiYCxbwSYC4JeiWLDE57 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCYB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-29 00:24:00

This development comes after a strong price surge, followed by a period of consolidation that mirrors the shape of a flag. Such patterns are typically interpreted as continuation signals, hinting that the recent upward momentum could resume if key conditions are met. Currently trading within this flag’s boundaries, XRP appears to be gathering strength for its next big move. A successful breakout would likely validate the bullish scenario, positioning the altcoin for significant gains and sparking renewed optimism in the market. Conversely, a breakdown below the lower boundary could undermine hopes, paving the way for a possible retracement. Analyzing The Bullish Flag: A Closer Look At XRP’s Pattern The bullish flag pattern is a reliable continuation signal in technical analysis, suggesting further upside potential. For XRP, this pattern has gained attention as it indicates the cryptocurrency may be preparing for its next upward move. Related Reading: XRP Price Takes a 5% Hit: Is More Downside Ahead? XRP’s price initially surges, creating a “flagpole” driven by strong positive momentum and high volume. Following this is a consolidation phase where the price moves within a narrow range, typically downward or sideways. This consolidation represents a temporary pause in the uptrend, allowing the market to digest gains. It demonstrates resilience, suggesting that selling pressure is manageable and the bullish trend could resume. Furthermore, the formation is validated when the price breaks out above the upper boundary of the flag, resuming its prior upward trajectory. Such a breakout would signal renewed buying interest and the potential to test higher price levels. Key indicators to watch include increased trading volume during the breakout as this confirms market participation and bullish conviction. Additionally, XRP must sustain its momentum above the resistance level to avoid the risk of a false breakout. Key Resistance And Support Levels: Navigating The Breakout Potential If XRP’s price breaks out above the upper boundary of the bullish flag pattern, it could signal the continuation of the uptrend and open the door for a move toward higher price levels, with the next major resistance zone near $2.90. A successful breakout above this level would reinforce the upside trend, possibly leading to new price highs.

A decisive break below this level could signal a shift in market sentiment, potentially leading to further downside movement. Such a breach would suggest that the bullish momentum has faltered, and the next support zone might be tested, which may trigger additional selling pressure.

The Bitcoin price performance is also impacting the crypto market, but most experienced investors argue that this is a momentary phase. Interestingly, an engineer believes that the biggest Bitcoin bull run is coming soon, considering the M2 marker. Understanding the Biggest Bitcoin Bull Run Phase In a recent tweet, a popular crypto analyst & engineer, Ted Boydston, presented an interesting BTC price analysis, predicting the upcoming Bitcoin bull run phase. According to Ted’s analysis , the price oscillator on the M2 has recently formed, which provides buy and sell signals. As the M2 money stock analyses the liquid cash circulation, including physical cash (M1), checking deposits, and other near money instruments like saving, money markets, etc, it is a key economic indicator that influences all the financial markets, including the crypto market. The engineer’s prediction also focuses on the same, as he talks about the Bitcoin price movements and the global liquidity trends. More importantly, the oscillator derived from the PPO of M2 sits at the lower panel. As a result, it flashed the buy signal and entered the green zone. More importantly, historical reports confirm that such signals often head to major money printing and Bitcoin’s manic phase. Eventually, this leads to the famous Bitcoin bull run. During this time, investors often witness increased price volatility and rapid price appreciation. Although this signal works pretty well, there was one exception in 2016. It failed to flash a signal back then, as the Bitcoin halving event primarily drove the BTC price rally. Interestingly, the investor’s expectations are still consistent to witness Bitcoin regaining support and surging past the current ATH of $108.2k. Expert Bitcoin Price Predictions & Forecasts Until recently, the biggest target for BTC price was $100k, but that has been achieved, so now the eyes are on what’s more coming. Many crypto analysts have claimed to see Bitcoin price at $150k or even $1M, but the most understandable one is that Bitcoin might reach $225k per Boydston’s analysis. Boydston talks about the manic phase bull market, wherein each BTC cycle, a top is formed at around 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level. If the same data is put in the current cycle, the BTC price target is $225K with the Bitcoin bull run. Another crypto analyst has come with a similar outlook and predicted that Bitcoin price could reach $225k in June 2025. More importantly, he also predicted a major altcoin season beginning after that. Such similar outlooks increased the probability of that happening for real. One other outlook focuses on Tether’s dominance, which is in a tough spot with its decreasing circulating supply with Europe’s Tether Ban. Final Thoughts Ted Boydston’s analysts’ Bitcoin price prediction has presented a new image of the possible bull market for this cryptocurrency. As the M2 has flashed a buy signal, this has hinted that Bitcoin’s manic phase will begin soon. Interestingly, another crypto analyst has added the timelines to that as the Bitcoin bull run could result in the BTC price hitting $225k in June 2025 before handing over the bulls to the altcoins. This might make hundreds of investors’ dreams come true. However, careful investment and strategic planning are a must, as many factors could hinder this path. More importantly, running the technical analysis and making smart decisions are the keys to returns, not the internet analysts’ prediction, as they vary from time to time and from person to person.

On Dec. 29, El Salvador acquired an additional 1 BTC, bringing its total holdings to 6,000.77 Bitcoin, valued at $569.3 million, according to the National Bitcoin Office’s portfolio tracker. This latest purchase reflects a gain of 108.02% on its Bitcoin investment, with an average acquisition price of $45,450 per BTC, as per the Nayib Bukele portfolio tracker. The country made its first Bitcoin purchase of 200 BTC on Sept. 6, 2021, coinciding with its historic decision to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. El Salvador Among Top Bitcoin-Holding Nations With 6,000.77 BTC, El Salvador ranks sixth in Bitcoin holdings among nation-states, following the United States, China, the United Kingdom, Ukraine, and Bhutan, according to BitBo’s Bitcoin Treasuries data. Although El Salvador typically acquires one Bitcoin daily, it made significant purchases on Dec. 22 and one day after striking a $1.4 billion agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This occurred despite the IMF urging the country to scale back its Bitcoin activities. Stacy Herbert, Director of El Salvador’s National Bitcoin Office, suggested in a Dec. 19 post on X that the country might accelerate its Bitcoin acquisitions. A Bitcoin Office spokesperson confirmed to Cointelegraph that El Salvador has no plans to sell its holdings, emphasizing that “Bitcoin continues to be our main strategy.” Chivo Wallet to Be Phased Out However, Herbert noted that El Salvador’s Chivo wallet will “be sold or wound down,” with private-sector Bitcoin wallets expected to take over the role.

Ali Martinez tells his 104,600 followers on the social media platform X that the Tom DeMark (TD) Sequential Indicator presented a bullish signal for DOGE. “The TD Sequential presents a buy signal on the Dogecoin DOGE four-hour chart, anticipating a price rebound!” Source: Ali Martinez/X Traders use the TD Sequential Indicator to predict potential trend reversals for tokens based on the closing prices of their 13 previous bars or candles. Martinez also notes that Dogecoin whales bought more than 90 million DOGE in the past two days. Source: Ali Martinez/X DOGE is trading at $0.314 at time of writing, a fractional decrease in the past 24 hours. Looking at Bitcoin ( BTC ), Martinez warns that traders should be worried if the top-ranked crypto asset by market cap drops below a certain price level. “You don’t want BTC to dip below $92,730 – it’s essentially free-fall territory if that level breaks.” Source: Ali Martinez/X Martinez suggests that below $92,730, the next on-chain support for BTC hovers at around $69,000 based on Glassnode’s UTXO ( Unspent Transaction Output ) Realized Price Distribution, a metric that shows the amount of Bitcoin that last moved within a specific price bucket. But while Martinez is sounding the alarm about a potential pullback for BTC, he notes that a 20-30% correction represents “the most bullish thing that could happen to Bitcoin.” Source: Ali Martinez/X Bitcoin is trading at $94,671 at time of writing.

While the Dogecoin price is exhibiting impressive growth prospects in this bull run, the meme coin faces limited upside, leaving Dogecoin whales to pursue massive returns on their investment elsewhere. Read on to see why ETFSwap (ETFS) is the perfect pick for Dogecoin-like gains towards 2025. Dogecoin Whales Are Targeting New Coins With Potential For Huge Profits Dogecoin whales are recognized as major market movers after hitting huge profits from early DOGE investments. Moreover, the Dogecoin price has impressed over the past few weeks, delivering decent gains to investors who caught the bullish trend early. However, experts believe the Dogecoin price provides limited upside due to its $50 billion market cap. As of this writing, the Dogecoin price is at $0.3343, having gained over 250% in the past year. Most Dogecoin holders at this stage of the market cycle are targeting a return to its $0.73 all-time high and potentially a surge to $1. Although Dogecoin whales have the size to make the most of this potential price surge, it makes sense to pursue other opportunities promising huge returns with a small investment. ETFSwap (ETFS) is in the price range that will make early investors millionaires at the peak of the bull run. Thus, the new DeFi token might set up early investors as the next generation of Dogecoin whales. ETFSwap (ETFS) Predicted For 45,000% Returns In Massive Breakout Pump ETFSwap (ETFS) is set for a rally that could deliver the biggest gains for the 2025 bull market. This new cheap DeFi token is attracting institutional and retail investors alike who see the prospects of its unique solution. At the same time, recent market trends show growing traction from Dogecoin whales as ETFSwap (ETFS) sees some heavy purchases. ETFSwap (ETFS) had a massive presale a few months back, and the Uniswap launch has featured major traction from investors capitalizing on its prospect for short and long-term gains. ETFSwap (ETFS) is a new platform that will deliver the ETF market on-chain , allowing investors to buy tokenized ETFs backed by actual securities from traditional markets. Also, the tokenized ETFs will feature assets from various industries , including healthcare, energy, engineering, and more. This gives users the option to easily diversify and convert between ETFs much easier than with centralized platforms. Additionally, ETFSwap (ETFS) will partner with regulated investment banks that trade both cryptocurrencies and securities. This enables cross-compatibility between ETFs and cryptocurrencies, creating a platform for easy crypto-to-ETF conversion. Furthermore, the new ETFSwap (ETFS) platform promises unique features , including faster ETF settlements, lower transaction costs, staking for passive rewards, and many more. Staking the native ETFS token will deliver up to 87% APR, and this cheap DeFi token is still incredibly cheap on Uniswap. As you consider adding the DeFi token to your portfolio, it’s pertinent to note that it’s listed on CoinMarketCap , and the ETFSwap (ETFS) team has passed a KYC audit by SolidProof . Conclusion Dogecoin whales are diversifying their DOGE holdings into ETFSwap (ETFS) to target huge market returns in the coming months. The new ETF platform is poised as the obvious option for investors looking to diversify into the ETF market. At the same time, its unique on-chain features will entice TradFi users to pursue more profits on the token. ETFSwap (ETFS) is a revolutionary project, and investing in the DeFi token while it’s still cheap on Uniswap could be highly profitable.

Homosexual Pepe (HOMOPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homosexual Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homosexual Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Homosexual Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homosexual Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homosexual Pepe by entering its contract address – 92xPeBxtanptFH9AYsRtwRMq7cWWw9GHfxaspwpNvCTP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOPEPE.

With the altcoin’s price now hovering around the $36 price zone, recent market predictions have highlighted a critical market condition needed to avoid a complete collapse of AVAX’s bullish structure. Related Reading: AVAX Price Inches Closer To $50 – Will Bulls Deliver A Breakout? AVAX Bulls Must Defend $35.30 For Total Price Recovery On December 27, digital asset analysis platform More Crypto Online shared an insightful commentary on the AVAX market via the X platform. With the aid of the Elliott Wave Theory, the market experts forecasted a yellow scenario which is typically a bullish projection. For context, the yellow scenario indicates an asset is in a corrective phase specifically within the B-wave of an A-B-C correction i.e a three-wave pattern that occurs during a price correction of which B is usually an upward movement that aligns with the ongoing market trend before transitioning to a final downward C-wave. A yellow scenario suggests the B-wave is still forming and could push higher, provided an asset’s price holds above certain levels. In terms of the AVAX market, analysts at More Crypto Online state the asset price must remain above $31.69 to keep the yellow scenario valid. However, to strengthen the case of this yellow scenario, market bulls must ensure AVAX’s price does not break below $35.3 as a dissent below this price region could potentiate a further decline to $31.69. The analyst warns that any price fall below this lower threshold would invalidate the yellow scenario resulting in a downward C-wave. Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) 25% Surge Fueled By New Initiatives To Support Developers AVAX Price Overview At the time of writing, AVAX trades at $36.74 following a decline of 2.12% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the altcoin’s daily trading volume is down by 6.40% and valued at $448.45 million. On larger time charts, AVAX is in greater losses of 11.65% in 7 days and 14.81% in 30 days, demonstrating a consistent decline in recent weeks. In making any headway, AVAX will first need to confront a major resistance at the $42 price zone, the subversion of which could open the pathway for a potential rally to $55. With the crypto bull run predicted to fully take off in early 2025, this altcoin remains an investor’s favorite following its price performance in the 2021 bull cycle during which it gained by over 4,400 to establish its current all-time high of $144.96. With a market cap of $14.92, AVAX continues to rank as the 11th largest asset in the cryptocurrency market.

Hedera Hashgraph is attracting institutional interest with its groundbreaking ETF filing, enhancing market liquidity. Meanwhile, Cardano has witnessed a remarkable 76% increase in value within a week, thanks to strategic alliances and significant activity from major investors. Yet, Web3Bay is reshaping the e-commerce sector by offering a fully decentralized platform that cuts out expensive middlemen. Its initial token offering starts at just $0.003 each, with projections showing a potential return of 6430%, highlighting it as a particularly promising investment. Web3Bay successfully combines blockchain’s capabilities with practical applications, making it the preferred option for progressive investors. Significant Advancements in Hedera Hashgraph Recently, Hedera Hashgraph has seen considerable developments, especially with Canary Capital filing for the first-ever HBAR ETF. This initiative is set to facilitate regulated access to Hedera’s tokens, potentially attracting more institutional investors and enhancing liquidity in the market. Following this development, the price of HBAR increased by nearly 20%, a reflection of the positive response from investors. Additionally, the inclusion of HBAR in Robinhood Markets’ crypto offerings has made it more accessible to traders in the U.S., further boosting its market presence. Cardano Experiences Strong Growth Cardano has shown impressive growth, with a 76% price increase noted last week. This surge is largely driven by significant buying from large-scale investors and is supported by the platform’s strategic partnerships and government projects. Although current technical indicators suggest Cardano might be overbought, potentially leading to short-term price adjustments, the continuous development and strategic efforts maintain its momentum and reinforce its position as a leading blockchain platform. Why Web3Bay’s Early Adopters Are Set for Phenomenal Growth Web3Bay is at the forefront of the e-commerce decentralization movement. Unlike traditional platforms that depend on banks and other financial intermediaries, Web3Bay eliminates these actors entirely. This blockchain-based marketplace allows users to conduct transactions directly, which significantly lowers costs and enhances both security and transparency. Moreover, Web3Bay’s 3BAY token is designed to support scalable network growth. It seamlessly integrates with major Layer-1 blockchains, ensuring that transaction processing remains fast and secure even as user activity increases. For those looking to invest early, Web3Bay’s presale offers an enticing entry point. The tokens are initially priced at just $0.003, with the price set to increase by 15% in each of the 28 stages, culminating at $0.1959 per token. This structured approach not only provides early backers with a potential ROI of 6430% but also positions them at the forefront of what could be a game-changing shift in e-commerce. Wrapping Up While Hedera and Cardano showcase the potential of blockchain for broader institutional acceptance and network expansion, Web3Bay is leading the way with actionable innovations. It transforms e-commerce by providing greater user control, transparency, and reduced fees.

Cardano (ADA) & Tron (TRX) Price Predictions Stay Positive,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdags-new-mystery-bonuses-begin-at-250-cardano-ada-tron-trx-price-predictions-stay-positive/,"As 2025 approaches, the crypto industry is growing, with notable projects advancing steadily. This week, the Cardano (ADA) price climbed to $0.937 despite less network activity, suggesting a guarded hope for its future performance. Simultaneously, the forecast for Tron remains positive, with TRX priced at $0.2573 and experts expecting a rise to $2 by 2030. On the other hand, in current presales, BlockDAG (BDAG) stands out as one of the best cryptos to buy now. Its BDAG400 bonus initially gives a 250% reward on the first purchase and offers more bonuses for subsequent buys. With a price projection of $1 by 2025, BlockDAG presents a unique chance for early participants to earn significant rewards. Cardano (ADA) Price Increases Despite Reduced Network Use This week saw the Cardano (ADA) price rebound sharply to $0.937, recovering impressively from recent lows. However, current statistics indicate possible hurdles ahead for the network. The transaction fees have fallen to a three-year low at 0.25 ADA on Wednesday, a drop from a peak of 0.615 ADA earlier in the year. This fee reduction, typically associated with lower network use, aligns with a notable decrease in daily active and new addresses, each down by over 35%. While the recovery in Cardano (ADA) price is encouraging, these indicators suggest a cautious outlook as overall network trends continue to evolve. Tron Price Prediction: Optimism for $0.5 by 2027 The outlook for Tron in the near term remains bullish, with TRX recently valued at $0.2573. Analysts predict continued growth, estimating a rise to $0.332 soon and targeting between $0.6718 and $0.8074 by 2027. By 2030, TRX is expected to exceed $2, indicating strong long-term growth prospects. Recent analyses show positive signals, such as a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 53.89, which points to solid market trust. Moreover, Tron’s recent partnership with Chainlink’s SCALE program, as revealed by founder Justin Sun last November, highlights its increasing practicality. These elements together strengthen the positive forecast for Tron’s price. BDAG Buyers Reap Big with BlockDAG’s Exclusive BDAG400 Bonus! BlockDAG introduces the BDAG400 bonus, presenting a great chance for early buyers to become part of this year’s biggest presale crypto . By applying the BDAG400 code during checkout, buyers gain a 250% bonus on their first purchase, effectively converting a purchase of 1,000 BDAG coins into 3,500 coins! The continuous purchases trigger even larger bonuses: a 270% bonus on the second buy, while the third, fourth, and fifth purchases contain bonus surprises in “mystery boxes.” This setup motivates continuous engagement, with each additional purchase unveiling further rewards. This bonus system includes a total of five rewards—two revealed initially and three as surprises—delivering substantial rewards for ongoing participants. However, this is a time-sensitive offer to acquire more of this exciting layer 1 coin through these bonuses. BlockDAG’s presale has witnessed remarkable success, with the coin’s value skyrocketing by 2240% from its starting price of $0.001. Those who joined early have reaped considerable rewards, solidifying BlockDAG’s position as one of the best cryptos to buy now. Market analysts project that BDAG might reach $1 by 2025, marking a significant opportunity for those looking to capitalize on its upward trajectory. Since its presale began, BlockDAG has raised over $173 million and sold 17.5 billion coins. Priced currently at $0.0234, the ongoing presale offers perfect timing for those looking for the best crypto to buy now. Yet, as the presale nears its $600 million goal, the window for early participation is closing rapidly. Wrapping Up These three coins showcase the diverse opportunities available in the crypto market. The Cardano (ADA) price remains robust with its recent increase, though a decline in network activity raises some concerns about its future. Tron is also making strides, with Tron price prediction indicating considerable growth to $2 by 2030, supported by its growing utility and positive market sentiment. Yet, for those considering the best crypto to buy now, BlockDAG stands out as a top pick. Its record-breaking presale success and promising future prospects position it as a prime candidate for significant returns. With a price prediction of $1 by 2025, the BDAG400 bonus system provides a unique opportunity for purchasers to substantially increase their BDAG holdings. For those aiming for remarkable returns, now is the time to engage, as this chance is fleeting.

While Bitcoin and Ethereum have long been the go-to choices for crypto enthusiasts, there’s a new player in town making some serious noise: Qubetics. As more investors search for alternative investment options to traditional assets, these digital assets are gaining traction. But what makes these coins different from each other? And why should you consider them now? Qubetics (TICS), Ethereum (ETH), and Kaspa (KAS) represent distinct aspects of the crypto ecosystem. Ethereum, the long-time giant of the smart contract world, has continued to thrive by fulfilling the demand for decentralised applications (dApps) and DeFi protocols. Kaspa, on the other hand, is quickly making a name for itself with its ultra-fast transaction speeds and scalability, appealing to investors looking for cutting-edge technology. And then there’s Qubetics, currently in its 13th presale stage, offering exciting potential and opportunities for early-stage investors who want to get in on the ground floor. Let’s break it down. Qubetics: The Fresh Gem with Unbeatable ROI Potential When looking for the best cryptos to invest in this weekend, Qubetics (TICS) should be on your radar. With its innovative AI-driven blockchain tools, Qubetics is poised to revolutionise how we think about blockchain development. The Qubetics presale is currently in its 13th stage, having raised over $8 million by selling more than 382 million $TICS tokens to over 12,200 holders. The $TICS token is priced at just $0.0342 in the 13th stage, but hold on – this price is set to surge by 10% come the weekend. The growth of Qubetics is undeniable, and the potential returns are jaw-dropping. Analysts predict that $TICS will be valued at $0.25 by the end of the presale, offering investors a staggering 630% return on investment (ROI). But it doesn’t stop there – once the presale wraps up and the project moves into its mainnet launch phase, the price of $TICS could skyrocket to as high as $5, offering an ROI of 14,503%. That’s enough to make even the most seasoned investors sit up and pay attention. Now, let’s talk about QubeQode Development Interface. This AI-powered IDE is a game-changer for blockchain development. Imagine being able to easily create and deploy smart contracts without having to be a coding expert. QubeQode simplifies the entire process, making blockchain accessible for businesses, professionals, and individuals alike. Whether you’re a developer looking for an intuitive platform to launch your next project or a business owner seeking to implement blockchain into your operations, QubeQode offers the perfect toolkit. For example, a small business wanting to incorporate blockchain into its supply chain can use QubeQode to develop smart contracts for automated payments and tracking. Or think about how developers building decentralized applications can drastically cut down development time with QubeQode’s easy-to-use interface. The possibilities are endless, and the demand for solutions like this is growing as businesses move towards adopting Web3 technologies. So, if you’re eyeing the best cryptos to invest in this weekend, Qubetics is a clear frontrunner with its revolutionary tools and impressive presale performance. Ethereum: The King of Smart Contracts Ethereum (ETH) has long held its position as one of the best cryptos to invest in this weekend, and for good reason. As the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum continues to be the backbone of decentralised applications (dApps) and the decentralised finance (DeFi) sector. Over the years, Ethereum has demonstrated its dominance in the market by consistently pushing the boundaries of blockchain technology and offering new, innovative solutions for investors and developers alike. The Ethereum network is most famous for its smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements that run on the blockchain without the need for intermediaries. This feature has made Ethereum the go-to platform for launching dApps, powering DeFi projects, and enabling the creation of NFTs. As of late 2024, Ethereum is also progressing with its shift to Ethereum 2.0, which promises to improve scalability, reduce energy consumption, and enhance network security. This upgrade could further cement Ethereum’s position as a dominant force in the crypto space. Ethereum’s position as a store of value and an investment vehicle has also been reinforced by its growing presence in institutional and retail markets. Investors have flocked to Ethereum not only for its technological advancements but also as a hedge against inflation and traditional market volatility. Ethereum’s flexibility, transparency, and security make it a reliable asset for diversifying an investment portfolio. If you’re looking for a strong and proven cryptocurrency that’s shown resilience over time, Ethereum continues to be one of the best cryptos to invest in this weekend. Kaspa: Speed, Scalability, and the Future of Blockchain If you’re searching for something fresh and innovative, Kaspa (KAS) is a name you need to know. Kaspa offers an entirely different take on blockchain technology, focusing on speed and scalability, which are two major challenges that traditional blockchains, including Ethereum, often struggle with. By using the DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) structure, Kaspa enables near-instant transaction finality and the ability to process tens of thousands of transactions per second. This makes Kaspa a highly attractive option for investors seeking fast, low-cost transactions in a decentralised network. The Kaspa network is gaining traction, especially as blockchain adoption increases, and it offers several advantages over legacy blockchain systems. Its ability to handle high throughput with minimal delays is particularly appealing for use cases in industries like financial services, gaming, and decentralized exchanges (DEXs), where speed is crucial. Additionally, the Kaspa team is committed to continuous development, with frequent network upgrades that enhance the overall user experience and scalability. While Kaspa’s market position is still emerging compared to Ethereum’s, the growth potential is massive. With its unique features and focus on solving the scalability issues that have plagued other blockchains, Kaspa is becoming an increasingly popular choice for those looking to diversify their cryptocurrency investments. For anyone who believes that speed and scalability will be the driving forces of the next generation of blockchain technologies, Kaspa is one of the best cryptos to invest in this weekend. Conclusion: The Future is Now – Take Action As the crypto market evolves, investors are presented with exciting opportunities, whether you’re looking for the stability of Ethereum, the speed of Kaspa, or the groundbreaking potential of Qubetics. These projects represent the future of finance and blockchain technology, each with its unique strengths and opportunities. If you’re looking for the best cryptos to invest in this weekend, Qubetics stands out with its strong presale performance and promising returns. The Qubetics presale has been a game-changer, with over $7 million raised and more than 355 million $TICS tokens sold to over 10,600 holders. Ethereum remains a rock-solid option for those seeking a proven store of value in the crypto space, while Kaspa offers a cutting-edge alternative for those who want speed and scalability in their investments. All three projects are pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in blockchain technology, and each of them has the potential to deliver impressive returns in the years to come. So, what are you waiting for? Don’t miss out on these incredible opportunities. Whether you choose to invest in Qubetics, Ethereum, or Kaspa, the time to act is now.

The crypto world is full of projects offering varying degrees of opportunity, but some have truly stood out for their long-term potential, solid community backing, and strong market presence. Solana and Ethereum have proven themselves as heavyweights in the blockchain space, and today, we’re going to explore why they’re still among the best cryptos to join now. But there’s a new contender on the block making waves – Qubetics (TICS) , which has already raised millions during its presale and is gearing up for a major launch. In this article, we’re going to dive into the strengths and market impact of Qubetics, Solana, and Ethereum, and why all of them represent exciting opportunities for crypto investors. Let’s start with Qubetics. This innovative platform is making a name for itself with a focus on blockchain development tools, including the game-changing QubeQode IDE. It’s still in its presale phase, but it’s already proven that its potential is massive. With over $8 million raised and more than 12,200 token holders, the $TICS token is poised for major gains as it approaches its final presale stages. Investors are already buzzing about its 630%+ potential ROI at presale’s end and a projected 14,500% ROI post-launch. Let’s take a closer look at Qubetics and why it’s one of the best cryptos to join now. Qubetics: The Future of Blockchain Development and Investment Qubetics is taking the blockchain world by storm, offering investors a unique opportunity to get in early on what many believe is a game-changing platform. Right now, the Qubetics presale is in its 13th stage, and it’s already raked in over $8 million, selling more than 382 million $TICS tokens to over 12,200 holders. The presale’s success is evident, with the token currently priced at $0.037, but it won’t stay there for long. The price is set to surge by 10% when the presale hits its next stage. For anyone looking for the best cryptos to join now , Qubetics represents a golden opportunity to secure massive returns before the price skyrockets. Analysts are buzzing about Qubetics’ potential for insane ROI. Some predict $TICS could hit $0.25 by the end of the presale, offering investors an eye-watering 630% return. Post-presale, experts are suggesting even bigger price leaps, with the $TICS token potentially hitting $1 (2820% ROI) or even $5 (14,503% ROI). And that’s not all. If $TICS continues its upward momentum after the mainnet launch, it could reach $15, offering a jaw-dropping 43,711% return on investment. But Qubetics isn’t just about incredible ROI. The platform’s cutting-edge technology is designed to address some of the major pain points in blockchain development, and this is where Qubetics truly shines. The QubeQode Development Interface is set to revolutionize the way developers, businesses, and professionals create smart contracts and dApps. Imagine being able to build complex blockchain applications without needing to be a coding expert. With QubeQode, that’s now possible. For businesses, QubeQode streamlines the entire blockchain development process . Whether you’re a startup or a well-established company, creating and deploying blockchain solutions can be costly and time-consuming. QubeQode makes it easier and more affordable than ever before to build decentralized applications, tokenise assets, and interact with the blockchain. For example, an e-commerce business could use QubeQode to integrate cryptocurrency payments without needing a full-time blockchain developer. With its intuitive interface and powerful features, QubeQode makes blockchain accessible to a whole new audience. Qubetics’ focus on accessibility, security, and scalability means it’s perfectly poised to capture the growing demand for Web3 technologies. Whether you’re an individual developer or part of a larger enterprise, Qubetics offers the tools you need to bring your blockchain vision to life. And with the $TICS token holding so much potential, now is the time to invest before the price inevitably rises. Solana: A High-Speed Blockchain with a Track Record of Success Solana has proven itself as one of the most reliable and efficient blockchain platforms in the crypto space. Known for its high-speed transactions and scalability, Solana has positioned itself as a top choice for developers and investors alike. Over the years, Solana has made a name for itself as one of the best cryptos to join now, thanks to its strong performance and growing adoption. What makes Solana stand out is its ability to handle thousands of transactions per second without compromising on security or decentralisation. With its innovative Proof-of-History (PoH) consensus mechanism, Solana has become one of the fastest blockchains on the market, processing over 65,000 transactions per second at its peak. This level of scalability is what has attracted both developers and institutional investors, who are keen on using Solana’s infrastructure to build decentralised applications (dApps) and facilitate high-frequency transactions. Solana’s impressive performance over the years has made it a strong alternative to Ethereum, which is known for its slower transaction speeds and higher fees. Solana has been able to attract major projects, including DeFi platforms, NFT marketplaces, and even large financial institutions. With its low transaction fees and speed, Solana has become a favourite among those looking for a blockchain that can handle high throughput without breaking the bank. For investors, Solana represents a unique opportunity. Its market position as a leading blockchain for decentralized finance (DeFi) and other dApp-based services has made it one of the most sought-after projects in the space. Analysts are optimistic about Solana’s future, with predictions suggesting that the token could see significant growth in the coming years. With its current price hovering around $218, many are confident that Solana will continue to play a central role in the blockchain ecosystem, making it one of the best cryptos to join now for long-term growth. Ethereum: The King of Smart Contracts and Decentralised Applications Ethereum remains one of the most well-known and established blockchain platforms in the world. It has cemented its position as the go-to platform for decentralised applications (dApps) and smart contracts, with thousands of developers building on its network. Ethereum has been a key driver of blockchain adoption, and it continues to be one of the best cryptos to join now due to its ongoing developments and major upgrades. Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) with Ethereum 2.0 was a pivotal moment in its history. The upgrade aims to make the network more scalable, secure, and energy-efficient, addressing some of the issues that have plagued Ethereum in the past. With the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, the network is now able to process more transactions per second while reducing its environmental impact. This has made Ethereum even more attractive to developers and investors who are looking for a blockchain that can support large-scale applications while also being more sustainable. Over the years, Ethereum has become synonymous with smart contracts and DeFi. It has served as the foundation for countless dApps, from NFT platforms to decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Ethereum has also become the leading platform for issuing new tokens, with the ERC-20 standard allowing developers to create their digital assets with ease. This has led to a massive influx of projects built on Ethereum, contributing to its strong market position. For investors, Ethereum represents a solid bet in the world of blockchain technology. With the ongoing developments in the Ethereum ecosystem, many analysts predict that Ethereum’s price could continue to rise, making it a strong contender for anyone looking for the best cryptos to join now. Conclusion: The Best Cryptos to Join Now Whether you’re looking for a high-potential presale like Qubetics, a fast, scalable blockchain like Solana, or a tried-and-tested smart contract platform like Ethereum, these three projects represent the best cryptos to join now for anyone looking to get into the crypto space. With their strong market positions, innovative technologies, and massive growth potential, these projects are set to play a key role in shaping the future of cryptocurrency. The Qubetics presale offers an incredible opportunity to get in early before it becomes a major player in the blockchain world. Solana and Ethereum have already proven themselves as solid investments, and they continue to show strong growth potential for the future. Are you ready to take the plunge and be part of the next big thing in crypto? The best time to invest is now, and with projects like Qubetics, Solana, and Ethereum leading the charge, the future of blockchain looks brighter than ever.

These low-cost tokens allow investors to build substantial positions and increase the chances of turning small investments into major returns if the projects succeed. Below, we highlight a few affordable cryptocurrencies that stand out for their growth potential and long-term value. Lightchain AI (LCAI) Integrating AI for Limitless Utility What Sets It Apart Lightchain AI (LCAI) revolutionizes how we view blockchain by adding a much-needed layer of real-world utility artificial intelligence (AI) integration. At a presale price of around $0.003, LCAI offers an ultra-low entry point and the chance for extraordinary returns. Key Features Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) Developers can build AI-powered decentralized applications (dApps), opening doors to predictive analytics in finance, automated supply chain management, and intelligent healthcare solutions. Proof of Intelligence (PoI) Instead of just validating transactions, LCAI’s nodes perform valuable AI computations, ensuring the network constantly generates tangible value. Transparent AI Framework This framework ensures that all AI decision-making processes within the platform are open and auditable, fostering trust among users and developers. Decentralized Governance Integration Lightchain AI combines decentralized governance with AI, enabling smarter, community-driven decision-making. Scalability and Efficiency The platform’s architecture is designed for high scalability, allowing it to handle a large number of transactions and AI computations efficiently, making it suitable for various industries. Privacy and Security Lightchain AI emphasizes data privacy and security, ensuring that AI computations and data handling comply with stringent privacy standards, which is crucial for sectors like healthcare and finance. Growth Potential If LCAI executes its roadmap and AI adoption continues to accelerate globally, early-stage investors could see their small initial investments multiply dramatically. Manta Network (MANTA) Privacy Solutions at Accessible Prices In the DeFi world, keeping info safe is getting more and more important. Manta Network is special because it gives tools that focus on safety for trading, lending and other money tasks, letting users guard their ͏data and plans. With its price now under a dollar MANTA is good choice for people who think safe options will have a big role in DeFi’s future. MANTA is ready for growth because of many reasons. Privacy is coming up as an important thing, mostly since more big players are joining the crypto and DeFi fields, which will likely raise the need for privacy solutions. Also MANTA’s low cost makes it easy for new investors to get in, letting them create large holdings without needing to put in much money at first. Casper (CSPR) Enterprise-Ready on a Budget Casper (CSPR) stands out by targeting enterprises looking for professional-grade blockchain solutions. It is specifically designed for scalability, upgradeability, and energy efficiency, making it an attractive option for businesses incorporating blockchain into their operations. While it may not have the flashiness of AI integration or advanced privacy features, its focus on enterprise adoption offers significant long-term growth potential. As more companies adopt Casper’s technology, the demand for CSPR tokens could steadily increase, making early investments at lower prices potentially very rewarding. How Lightchain AI (LCAI) Beats All And Could Multiply Your Investment Many Times Lightchain AI (LCAI) is an emerging cryptocurrency that integrates artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, offering innovative solutions like the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM). These advancements enhance scalability, security, and efficiency, positioning LCAI as a strong contender in the crypto market. Currently in its presale phase, LCAI tokens are available at $0.003, presenting a unique opportunity for early investors. Analysts project that LCAI could reach $0.50 by 2025, indicating a potential return of over 150 times the initial investment. LCAI’s focus on decentralized AI solutions addresses real-world challenges across various industries, including healthcare, finance, and supply chain management. This broad applicability enhances its growth potential and appeal to a diverse investor base. Investors should conduct thorough research and consider the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrency investments before participating. Invest Early, Invest Smart The cryptocurrency market is constantly evolving, with new projects and innovations emerging regularly. As an investor, it’s important to stay informed and consider potential growth opportunities in addition to established players like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Projects like Lightchain AI presale a million-dollar gain opportunity so early investment at a low price should be considered carefully. Invest in Lightchain AI (LCAI) now to secure your spot and take advantage of this promising project’s growth potential. Don’t miss out on the chance to turn a small investment into significant returns!

Ju explained that store-of-value assets like gold and Bitcoin tend to rise in price when investors feel US economic dominance is under threat. However, he noted that confidence in the US economy and the dollar remains strong, with many investors continuing to view the dollar as a safe haven currency. This perception of strength, Ju argued, makes it unlikely that the Trump administration would adopt a Bitcoin strategic reserve. Instead, Trump may prioritize policies that reinforce the dominance of the US dollar. Ju stated: “Even before his inauguration, Trump consistently warned other world leaders of the power gap between the US and other nations. This rhetoric, combined with increased capital inflows to the dollar, could renew confidence in its supremacy.” He added, “Around me, many Koreans are choosing US dollars as a safe haven over gold or Bitcoin, particularly as the Korean won weakens.” This trend is mirrored in emerging economies, where individuals increasingly use US dollar stablecoins to store value. Stablecoins Boost US Dollar Dominance Paxos CEO Charles Cascarilla recently told Cointelegraph at the Bitcoin MENA conference that stablecoins will be central to the blockchain economy. According to him, dollar-pegged stablecoins enhance the utility of the dollar by combining fiat currency stability with the speed and global reach of blockchain technology. In countries like Turkey, where inflation hit 67% in March 2024, stablecoins have become vital. Turkey leads the world in stablecoin purchases as a percentage of GDP. Similarly, a 2023 Chainalysis report revealed that over 50% of digital assets sent to countries like Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico were stablecoins.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-29 03:03:00

Prince Elon (ELONPRIN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONPRIN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.

The stories of people who turned a few hundred dollars into life-changing wealth haunt every crypto enthusiast who joined too late. One such recent example is Turbo (TURBO), a meme coin that started as a joke but ended up delivering staggering returns. If you missed the Turbo train, don’t worry. History is offering a second chance in the form of BTFD Coin’s top crypto presale . Meme coins have carved out a niche in the crypto world, delivering massive gains to savvy investors who get in early. Now, BTFD Coin is set to redefine this trend with its unique offerings: a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, a 90% staking APY, and an innovative referral programme. Add to this its festive price rollback to Stage 7 rates, and it’s clear that BTFD Coin is a chance no investor should ignore. BTFD Coin: Your Chance to Seize the Dip For those unfamiliar, BTFD represents “ Buy The Dip ,” a rallying cry for crypto enthusiasts looking to profit from market downturns. BTFD Coin’s presale began at $0.000004 per token and has already scampered to Stage 13, priced at $0.000014—an 837.5% ROI for early adopters. But here’s the kicker: for a limited time, investors can grab BTFD tokens with a 50% bonus by using the code BIG50. Features Setting BTFD Apart: Play-to-Earn Game: The beta version of BTFD’s P2E game went live in Stage 10, allowing users to engage with the ecosystem while preparing for future rewards. 90% APY on Staking: Staking went live on December 2, offering investors a secure way to grow their holdings. Referral Programme: Earn 10% of raised funds in BTFD tokens by promoting the presale, with additional rewards for leaderboard positions. Bulls Squad Community: A vibrant community fostering collaboration and market insights. Imagine this: investing $5,000 in Stage 12 at $0.000013 per coin would yield approximately 78.125 million tokens. When BTFD lists at $0.0006 post-presale, your $5,000 could balloon to $46,875—an ROI of nearly 837.5%. BTFD’s unique roadmap ensures sustained interest and utility. Its tokenomics, including locked liquidity and community rewards, provide stability while incentivising long-term holding. With over $4.6 million raised and 60 billion coins sold, this is shaping up to be one of the year’s hottest presales . Turbo (TURBO): The Meme Coin You Missed Turbo, a meme coin launched in 2024, has captivated investors with its quirky branding and rapid adoption. Initially priced at fractions of a cent, Turbo soared to $0.00997 following its Coinbase listing. Investors who spotted the opportunity early walked away with massive gains, while latecomers were left wishing they had acted sooner. Turbo’s rise is a testament to the power of community-driven projects. Its unique marketing campaigns and high-profile exchange listings propelled it to meme coin stardom. However, like many meme coins, Turbo remains highly volatile. After reaching its peak, its value dipped to $0.0089, reflecting the speculative nature of the market. For those who missed out on Turbo’s early stages, the regret is palpable. But there’s no need to dwell on the past. The lessons learned from Turbo’s success can be applied to BTFD Coin, which is currently in its presale phase and poised for a significant post-launch rally. Why BTFD Stands Out While Turbo dazzled with its rapid price appreciation, BTFD offers a more robust value proposition. Turbo’s appeal was primarily driven by hype and community support, whereas BTFD combines meme coin charm with tangible utility. BTFD’s P2E game and high APY staking programme provide real-world benefits, making it more than just a speculative asset. Moreover, the ongoing presale allows investors to enter at a discounted price, maximising potential returns. Analysts predict BTFD’s listing price of $0.0006 could deliver exponential gains, making it a compelling alternative for those who missed Turbo’s meteoric rise. Join the BTFD Presale Before It’s Too Late! Seizing this opportunity is as simple as following these steps: Visit the BTFD Coin Presale Page . Connect your wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet). Put the bonus code BIG50 . Specify the amount of BTFD you wish to purchase. Confirm the transaction and secure your bonus tokens. With the presale ending soon, there’s no time to waste. Early investors have already reaped significant rewards, and the next wave of gains could be yours. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Your Second Chance If you’ve ever regretted not investing in a promising project like Turbo during its early stages, consider this your wake-up call. BTFD Coin’s top crypto presale is a golden opportunity to secure tokens at a discounted price and ride the wave of its post-launch success. With its P2E game, staking rewards, and community-driven growth, BTFD Coin is more than a meme—it’s a movement. Act now to claim your share of the future. Use the code BIG50 to get the bonus and seize the dip before it’s too late. The bulls are charging, and you don’t want to be left in the dust.

A crypto analyst has identified a new Cup and Handle pattern, suggesting that the top meme coin is likely headed for more pain, with a potential crash below $0.2. Chart Pattern To Trigger Dogecoin Price Crash A TradingView analyst known as ‘Cryptechcapital’ has shared a chart representing an Elliott Wave analysis of Dogecoin’s price movements on a long-term weekly time frame. While the analyst has provided a detailed report on Dogecoin’s present Elliott Wave structure, he has identified the formation of a textbook Cup and Handle pattern. Related Reading: Historical Data Shows What To Expect From Ethereum Price In Q1 2025 – It’s Very Bullish A Cup and Handle pattern is a technical indicator that signals a period of consolidation before a breakout. While it is typically considered a bullish signal that extends an uptrend, the crypto analyst has noted that its appearance in Dogecoin‘s chart points to a significant price correction to new lows. The analyst’s Dogecoin price chart outlines a 5-wave impulse structure from 1 to 5. Dogecoin is currently at Wave 4, a correction wave, where prices retrace and move sideways for a prolonged period. The handle of the Cup and Handle pattern also corresponds with Wave 4 of Dogecoin’s 5-wave structure. In the immediate term, the TradingVolume analyst has predicted a significant Dogecoin price crash once it completes Wave 4. He suggested that if the Cup and Handle pattern holds, Dogecoin may experience downward pressure over the next week. The analyst also added that the broader cryptocurrency market might face similar bearish headwinds, particularly with the rising market volatility and Bitcoin’s declining price. While the exact levels of the analyst’s projected decline are not specified, Wave 4 corrections are usually known to retrace significant portions of the previous Wave 3 gains. This means that if Dogecoin experiences a price decline during Wave 4, a potential dip below $0.2 could be possible. Dogecoin Crash First, Recovery Next? While Cryptechcapital has predicted a significant price crash for Dogecoin, he also asserts that this anticipated correction could pave the way for a powerful rebound. The TradingView analyst revealed that after the completion of Wave 4, Dogecoin is expected to enter Wave 5, signaling the end of its bearish phase and the beginning of a potential price rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Retests Support Line After Crash Below $95,000, Here’s The Next Target As mentioned above, the Cup and Handle pattern often signals the final consolidation phase before a price breakout. The TradingView analyst has predicted that Dogecoin could undergo a severe price crash before triggering a price recovery to the coveted $1 mark. The analyst’s price chart also highlights that if Dogecoin achieves a local high instead of continuing its projected correction, the Cup and Handle pattern will be invalidated. This development would require a new forecast for Dogecoin’s price trajectory.

The opportunity became especially apparent after Tether’s decision to discontinue its EURt stablecoin. For years, Tether Holdings has led the charge of stablecoins reshaping the global finance space. However, as traditional finance increasingly opens up to the crypto space, banks are also making the move to test the stablecoin issuance waters. Bloomberg reported that these banks will be looking to fill the chasm created as Tether Holdings discontinues its EURt stablecoin. Tether launched the EURt stablecoin in 2016. However, unlike the firm’s leading product USDT, the EURt failed to meet expectations and struggled to gain traction after its launch. Its market capitalization declined to an almost irrelevant figure of $37M compared to USDT’s market cap of over $138B. Tether Holdings announced in November that it will discontinue the EURt stablecoin in accordance with the new Market in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations in Europe. All aboard the stablecoin train Tether’s $10B in net profits has proven to be a major incentive for traditional banks, who are wasting no time in making their moves. Societe Generale-Forge (SG-Forge) has already launched a Euro-backed stablecoin ( EURCV ) and opened the product to retail investors. Oddo BHF , BBVA , and Revolut are exploring releasing their versions of euro-denominated stablecoins. AllUnity also plans to issue another euro-based stablecoin next year. MiCA has provided a clear regulatory framework for stablecoins and crypto assets in the EU, making it easy for companies and banks to issue their stablecoins. This clarity also created an allowance for competition in the stablecoin market, especially as Tether continues to drag its feet with meeting all the standards of the new European regulation. Jean-Marc Stenger, CEO of SG-FORGE, confirmed that multiple banks are in discussions to use its stablecoin technology either through partnerships or white-label deals. Banks in the US are lagging behind as there is no legislation in place that allows for the issuance of stablecoins. They are however expected to swarm the market once the legislation is passed. The global surge of stablecoins Traditional banks aren’t the only companies riding the stablecoin wave. Visa launched a tokenization network to ease the issuance of stablecoins. BBVA is among the banks piloting Visa’s technology, and it’s in discussions with many other banks as well. Cuy Sheffield, the head of crypto at Visa, confirmed in an interview with Bloomberg that they have received offers from banks in Singapore, Brazil and Hong Kong. “We are actively engaged with a number of banks across the world at various stages of the process,” he said. Standard Chartered partnered with Animoca Brands Ltd. and Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd., and was selected as one of the first issuers of HKD-denominated stablecoins in an experimental program. JPMorgan Chase has been exploring deposit tokens which are similar to stablecoins but are tied to bank accounts. The deposit tokens have limitations that can be offset by the use of stablecoins, allowing banks to leverage blockchain technology to overcome some of the inherent challenges in traditional banking systems. However, the use of stablecoins comes with its own set of challenges for banks. A European Central Bank analysis showed that converting retail deposits into stablecoin reserves could weaken liquidity coverage ratios, compromising banks’ ability to meet short-term obligations during turbulent periods. US regulators would also need to clarify what counts as acceptable reserves and whether stablecoin deposits will be insured to avoid user panic. The rise of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) is also an issue as it threatens bank-issued stablecoins for wholesale payments and other use cases. Even with these hurdles, Tether is sitting on a $10B gold mine, and banks seem to believe the stablecoin headache is a problem worth having.

Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-29 04:42:00

The climate of the broad market has been sluggish in the festive period, with the two largest assets Bitcoin and Ethereum struggling to make a mark. With the Toncoin price now approaching the $6 mark, it appears that the altcoin is now fully in its recovery phase. According to a pseudonymous analyst, a recent on-chain phenomenon suggests that the price rally for TON is only just beginning. What Happened Last Time TON Staking TVL Ratio Was At A Low Level? In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, an analyst with the pseudonym Joaowedson discussed the dynamics between the staking TVL ratio and Toncoin price. According to the analyst, there is a correlation between the amount locked on TON and price movements. Related Reading: Historical Data Shows What To Expect From Ethereum Price In Q1 2025 – It’s Very Bullish The Quicktake analyst highlighted a trend whereby investors withdraw their assets in order to explore trading opportunities whenever there is a price increase. This phenomenon has also been observed in the TON ecosystem, with the TVL metric dropping in recent weeks. Joaowedson noted that the staking TVL ratio has reached new lows, coinciding with what appears to be a bottom for the price of Toncoin. Ultimately, this suggests that the odds of an increase in the Toncoin price are higher. While the idea of reduced interest in staking leading to price growth seems counterintuitive, it can be justified by the increase in liquidity available for trading. The Quicktake analyst explained: When investors withdraw funds from staking, they often transfer them to exchanges for quick trades. This movement increases demand for the token, driving prices higher. From a historical perspective, a similar situation occurred in March 2024 when the staking TVL ratio shrunk significantly as the TON price soared to new highs. “Interestingly, as interest in staking diminished, funds started migrating to centralized exchanges (CEX) and decentralized exchanges (DEX) like Ston.FI and Dedust, boosting the TVL in those categories,” Joaowedson added. With investors more willing to make their assets available for trading, there is a higher likelihood of price increases due to growing demand. If this holds true, the Toncoin price could return to around its recent highs. Toncoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the Toncoin price stands at around $5.78, reflecting a 0.5% decline in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the value of TON is up by more than 6% on the weekly timeframe.

From playful tokens to serious players, these coins are dominating conversations. With the rise of innovative features and creative communities, meme coins are no longer just a joke; they’re now serious contenders in the investment game. For anyone looking to ride the wave of crypto hype, meme coins are worth a look. But how do you choose the best meme coins for exponential returns in a market so crowded? Enter BTFD Coin (BTFD), a trailblazer in the meme coin ecosystem that’s redefining the genre. With its electrifying presale, innovative staking rewards, and a Play-to-Earn game that’s turning heads, BTFD is creating excitement like never before. Moreover, with its BIG50 code offering 50% extra $BTFD coins, it’s the meme coin to watch. But BTFD isn’t alone in this space. Let’s dive into the five hottest meme coins that are grabbing headlines and could make you rethink your investment strategy. 1. BTFD Coin (BTFD): Redefining the Meme Coin Revolution When it comes to meme coins that pack a punch, BTFD Coin is leading the charge. With its presale breaking records and a community that’s rallying around its bold vision, BTFD Coin is one of the best meme coins for exponential returns this year. Let’s break it down. BTFD Coin is more than just a catchy acronym. It stands for “Buy The Dip,” a rallying cry for crypto enthusiasts who know the value of seizing opportunities during market downturns. Its presale launched at a humble $0.000004 per coin, but it’s now in Stage 13 at $0.00013, with over $4.6 million raised and more than 60 billion coins sold to over 7,000 holders. And with a listing price set at $0.0006, there’s massive potential for growth. One of BTFD’s standout features is its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, which made its beta version live during Stage 10 of the presale. While the beta version doesn’t offer rewards yet, it’s a sneak peek at what’s to come. The game, combined with a robust 90% APY staking programme and an exclusive Referral Programme, has created a buzz that’s hard to ignore. Let’s not forget the Bulls Squad, a dedicated community driving engagement and spreading the word about this powerhouse coin. Why did this coin make it to this list? BTFD Coin’s presale success, unique features, and the promise of exponential returns put it at the top of the list. If you’re looking to jump in, visit the presale page, connect your wallet, enter the bonus code BIG50, and grab 50% extra $BTFD coins before the deal expires on January 5th. 2. Book of Meme (BOME): The Literary Wonder of Meme Coins In a sea of meme coins, Book of Meme (BOME) stands out with its narrative-driven approach. Instead of just riding trends, BOME has built an entire ecosystem around storytelling, blending humour with community-driven lore. It’s a unique twist that’s resonating with a growing fanbase. BOME has launched a series of collectible NFTs tied to chapters of its fictional universe. These aren’t just digital trinkets; they’re integral to the coin’s ecosystem, offering holders perks like staking bonuses and early access to exclusive content. The team behind BOME is also rolling out an educational campaign, teaching newcomers about crypto through bite-sized memes. Think of it as a crash course in decentralised finance with a side of laughter. BOME’s value proposition lies in its strong focus on community. By fostering a sense of belonging through storytelling and interactive content, it’s creating a sticky user base. Investors aren’t just buying tokens; they’re becoming part of a larger narrative, which is why BOME’s popularity is skyrocketing. Why did this coin make it to this list? Book of Meme offers a unique blend of creativity and functionality, making it more than just another meme coin. It’s capturing imaginations while offering real-world utility, a rare combo that promises exponential returns. 3. Shiba Inu (SHIB): The OG That Keeps Surprising No list of the best meme coins for exponential returns is complete without Shiba Inu. It’s the granddaddy of modern meme coins, having carved out a niche that few others can match. What started as a joke has become a robust ecosystem, complete with its own decentralised exchange (ShibaSwap), an NFT collection, and even plans for a metaverse. Shiba Inu’s strength lies in its ability to pivot and adapt. While its early days were all about riding the Dogecoin hype, it’s now focusing on creating value for its holders. ShibaSwap, for example, allows users to stake their SHIB tokens, earn rewards, and participate in governance. The recent launch of Shibarium, a Layer 2 blockchain, aims to reduce transaction fees and improve scalability—key factors for long-term growth. The SHIB Army, as its community is affectionately called, plays a huge role in its success. This is a group of die-hard fans who’ve taken it upon themselves to promote, educate, and build on Shiba Inu’s ecosystem. Their commitment is a testament to the power of community in crypto. Why did this coin make it to this list? Shiba Inu’s proven track record, innovative projects, and dedicated community make it a no-brainer for anyone seeking exponential returns in the meme coin market. 4. Neiro (NEIRO): The Futuristic Meme Coin Neiro is shaking things up with its AI-driven features. It’s the first meme coin to integrate artificial intelligence into its core operations, promising a future where meme coins aren’t just for laughs but also for smart investments. At its heart, Neiro uses AI algorithms to predict market trends and provide holders with actionable insights. This isn’t just pie-in-the-sky tech; early adopters have reported significant gains by leveraging these insights. Neiro is also exploring partnerships with blockchain gaming companies, aiming to create an ecosystem where its token is the default currency for in-game transactions. What’s particularly exciting about Neiro is its focus on sustainability. Unlike many meme coins that rely on hype, Neiro is building a foundation for long-term growth. Its developers are transparent, its roadmap is ambitious but realistic, and its community is growing organically—no bots, just real people. Why did this coin make it to this list? Neiro’s innovative use of AI, focus on sustainability, and potential for exponential returns make it a standout in the meme coin universe. 5. Bonk (BONK): Solana’s Meme Coin Darling Bonk is Solana’s answer to Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. It’s the first meme coin on the Solana blockchain, and it’s making waves with its lightning-fast transactions and ultra-low fees. If you’ve ever been frustrated by Ethereum’s high gas fees, Bonk might just be your ticket to meme coin heaven. What sets Bonk apart is its community-first approach. The coin was airdropped to thousands of Solana users, creating an instant buzz and a broad holder base. This strategy has not only increased its adoption but also strengthened its community. Bonk’s developers are also committed to building tools and resources for creators, adding utility to what’s traditionally been a hype-driven market. Bonk’s roadmap includes plans for decentralised applications (dApps) and a unique staking mechanism that rewards long-term holders. While it’s still early days, the coin’s performance so far suggests it’s got staying power. Why did this coin make it to this list? Bonk’s innovative use of the Solana blockchain, combined with its community-first ethos, makes it a strong contender for exponential returns in 2024 and beyond. Why Buying the Dip Matters If history has taught us anything, it’s that economic downturns are ripe with opportunities. Take 1973, for instance. The global economy took a massive hit, yet those who invested wisely during the crash came out on top. The same logic applies today. In a market that’s anything but stable, buying the dip—or investing during bearish trends—can set you up for monumental gains. That’s where BTFD Coin comes in. Designed for those who see opportunity in chaos, it’s the perfect meme coin for these turbulent times. With its presale blazing past expectations and features like high-yield staking, P2E gaming, and an engaging Referral Programme, BTFD is built for investors who know the value of acting now. Conclusion The meme coin universe is buzzing with energy, creativity, and innovation, making it an irresistible space for crypto enthusiasts seeking exponential returns. Whether it’s BTFD Coin redefining presales with its insane features, Book of Meme pushing decentralisation boundaries, Shiba Inu proving the staying power of community-driven projects, Neiro tapping into AI-powered potential, or Bonk keeping Solana alive and kicking with fun, these coins showcase the best of what’s possible in the meme coin ecosystem.

While both HBAR and LINK prices are set to benefit greatly, the new AI-driven GambleFi protocol Rollblock (RBLK) is predicted to beat the two altcoins effortlessly. Let’s dig into why analysts tout RBLK as the best crypto investment of 2025 that could deliver staggering yields north of 50x. Rollblock (RBLK) is set to disrupt online casino markets with AI This Ethereum-based gambling protocol is turning the massive gambling empire on its head with a blockchain-powered, AI-driven GambleFi ecosystem. The iGaming juggernaut employs AI technology to support advanced betting strategies and copy-betting player initiatives, giving more competitive odds to players than other casino platforms. Furthermore, all gaming activity is posted on-chain, offering full transparency to players’ bets and transactions. Thus, no one can alter bets, injecting credibility into the infamous gambling industry. Things get even more alluring on the investment side. The iGaming platform pays weekly dividends to investors from a share of its profits, with RBLK token holders staking their coins earning up to 30% APY! Disrupting even a tiny share of the $540 billion casino market will be sufficient to make Rollblock a multibillion iGaming protocol on Ethereum, pushing the RBLK market cap to billions. That will spark a parabolic price action for the RBLK token, with analysts predicting it could surge 880% in presale and potentially blast past 50x on the launch! Hedera price up over 100% monthly Hedera price (HBAR) is on the fly. HBAR was up 106% month-to-date, pushing its yearly gains past 221%. That spectacular performance comes amid Hedera’s partnership with tech giant Nvidia and blockchain oracle Chainklink to power the development of enterprise AI applications and ensure secure data feeds and tokenization of real-world assets. These new developments are expected to enhance the platform’s appeal for developers and institutions, driving broader adoption of the Hedera network. As of press time, HBAR was trading with a slight pullback in the $0.28 zone. CoinCodex data shows it might surge over 196% to hit $0.86 by August 2025, making HBAR an attractive crypto investment . Chainlink (LINK) could surpass its ATH in 2025 Chainlink is the largest data oracle that feeds secure and reliable data to DeFi applications running smart contracts. Its recent partnership with Hedera underscores its vital role within the blockchain ecosystem, positioning LINK as a top crypto investment for value-oriented investors. In its recent upshot, LINK hit $30 before pulling back in the past weeks to hover in the $23 zone. At the current price, LINK was only up 29% monthly, bringing its year-to-date returns to 52%. Given its solid fundamentals, analysts believe LINK could be undervalued, and the altcoin is expected to push upward in 2025. LINK ‘s community sentiment was 89% bullish, and CoinCodex data reveals it could hit $85 by May 2025, pulling a 260% yield. Which is the best crypto investment: HBAR, LINK, or RBLK? HBAR and LINK are already established crypto assets and their large market caps limit their upside potential. However, RBLK is a new crypto gem that analysts believe is greatly undervalued at the $0.044 price, and analysts believe it’s one of the best crypto investment s.

38254792,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=667895,1735452036,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/38254792.jpeg,Doji Formation On Bitcoin Chart Suggests BTC Could See 2 Months Of Upside In The New Year,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/doji-formation-on-bitcoin-chart-suggests-btc-could-see-2-months-of-upside-in-the-new-year/,"The Bitcoin price looks set to enjoy a bullish reversal in January next year, having maintained a tepid price action to close out this year. This bullish outlook for the flagship crypto came as crypto analyst Tony Severino revealed a potential Doji formation, which suggested that BTC could enjoy this uptrend in the new year. Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘Head and Shoulders’ Setup Raises Fears Of $80,000 Price Drop – Details Doji Formation Could Lead To New Year Bitcoin Price Rally In an X post, Severino suggested that a Doji formation could lead to a Bitcoin price rally in the first two months of the new year. The analyst mentioned that he suspects BTC will end December with the Doji and then January shows a strong continuation for the flagship crypto. His accompanying chart showed that this strong continuation could extend into February. The crypto analyst explained that a Doji represents a pause in the market due to indecision from buyers and sellers. He added that the following candlestick shows market participants the decision the market has made through strong continuation or a reversal. In this case, Severino expects that the following candlestick will show a strong continuation for the Bitcoin price. Severino noted that a similar Doji at similar subwaves each resulted in two more months of upside before a local top was in for the Bitcoin price. Therefore, the crypto could enjoy two months of upside between January and February 2025 if history repeats itself. From a fundamental perspective, Donald Trump’s inauguration is one factor that could spark this strong continuation. The BTC price rallied above $100,000 after Trump’s victory in the November US presidential elections. As such, the flagship crypto could continue this rally as Trump becomes the first pro-crypto US president. Moreover, the US president-elect may create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve when he takes office, which would provide more bullish momentum for BTC. BTC Needs To Hold Above $92,730 In an X post, crypto analyst Ali Martinez remarked that the Bitcoin price needs to avoid dipping below $92,730, as if that level breaks, it will be in free-fall territory. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that Bitcoin could drop to the $70,000 range if it breaks this $92,730 price level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Surge: Are Traders Preparing For A Major Market Shift? However, in another X post, Martinez suggested that such a Bitcoin price drop might not necessarily be bad. This came as he stated that a 20% to 30% price correction is the most bullish thing that could happen to Bitcoin. Meanwhile, Martinez stated that the invalidation levels for his bearish Bitcoin outlook are a sustained close above $97,300 and a daily close above $100,000. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $94,400, down almost 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Despite soaring market optimism in light of investors expecting a bullish Q4, top cryptocurrency prices have encountered volatility. Nevertheless, meme coin Shiba Inu has retained a bullish stance, witnessing remarkable community developments. Here’s a brief collection of some of the top crypto market updates reported by CoinGape Media over the past week. Bitcoin & Top Crypto Remain Turbulent BTC price closes the week at the $94K level, a mark indicating that the coin reversed recent gains. However, long-term prospects for the asset are still bullish as market participants reflect a buy-the-dip sentiment. Despite a volatile action, American company KULR announced that it purchased $21M worth of BTC, sparking market optimism. However, Bitcoin ETFs have seen slight outflows this week, sparking an uncertain investor sentiment. It’s noteworthy that Japan has rejected a Bitcoin National reserve proposal amid the recent volatile trend, sparking market speculations. Nevertheless, Robert Kiyosaki has given a bold prediction for BTC price, proclaiming it to hit $350K by 2025. Although recent market trends reflect volatility, market watchers remain optimistic about future movements in the wake of the abovementioned news. On the other hand, CoinGape reported that despite the turbulence in the broader sector, even Altcoins are seeing remarkable gains ahead. Notably, popular market expert Titan of Crypto hinted towards a bullish path ahead for the crypto market. In addition, renowned crypto expert Michael van de Poppe also remained bullish on the altcoin market’s future. Overall, market watchers are eagerly awaiting a market recovery in the coming days, with the bull run expected to continue in 2025. Shiba Inu Sees Remarkable Community Advancements Meanwhile, the renowned dog-themed meme crypto SHIB has seen remarkable community developments. Shiba Inu lead developer Shytoshi Kusama confirmed the TREAT token launch earlier this week. Simultaneously, the community also witnessed ‘SHIB: The Metaverse’ launch this week. In addition, Shibarium addresses crossed the 2 million mark, adding to market optimism surrounding the meme coin. Also, the SHIB burn saga has continued reducing the token’s circulating supply, paving a bullish path for future movements.

Homosexual Pepe (HOMOPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homosexual Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homosexual Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Homosexual Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homosexual Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homosexual Pepe by entering its contract address – 92xPeBxtanptFH9AYsRtwRMq7cWWw9GHfxaspwpNvCTP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-29 06:05:00
