Reportedly, AI is draining the country’s electricity like a high-tech vampire. As data centers multiply, guzzling more power than entire cities, millions of homes are getting hit with distorted power flows that wreak havoc on their appliances and jack up fire risks. “Bad harmonics” is the name of this nightmare. Normally, electricity flows smoothly, like ocean waves. But when AI-fueled data centers crank up their demands, those waves turn chaotic, destabilizing everything downstream. Think of it as a speaker blaring music so loudly it fries itself. That’s what’s happening to America’s power grid. Refrigerators start rattling, air conditioners overheat, and sparks can fly—literally. Whisker Labs, a company tracking power quality with one million sensors across U.S. homes, has reportedly uncovered a grim reality. The closer a home is to a data center, the worse the distortions. More than half of the homes with the worst power quality issues sit within 20 miles of a data center. That’s 3.7 million Americans caught in the crossfire of the AI boom. Data centers are turning the grid into a ticking time bomb Experts have been sounding the alarm about the impact of data centers for years, but AI has put this problem on steroids. These facilities are popping up like mushrooms, each demanding as much electricity as 10,000 homes. But the grid wasn’t built for this kind of pressure. The AI frenzy has turned Northern Virginia into ground zero. Dubbed “data center alley,” the region now holds 3,000 megawatts of data center capacity—double that of Beijing, its closest competitor. The power demands are so massive that Dominion Energy, the utility serving much of the area, is scrambling to build a new transmission line just to keep the lights on. In Prince William County, sensors installed in homes within seven miles of data centers showed alarming distortion levels. The report says nearly 6% of these homes reported power quality so bad it risks frying appliances. Some readings spiked as high as 12.9%, way beyond the 8% threshold where equipment starts failing. Meanwhile, York County, 80 miles from the nearest major data center, reported steady, low distortion levels. The connection is undeniable. AI is pushing America to the brink America’s grid was already hanging by a thread before AI came into the picture. Decades of underinvestment in infrastructure mean the system is aging and fragile. Now, electricity demand is set to spike by 16% over the next five years, with AI-driven data centers driving most of the growth. This isn’t just a city problem either. Even rural areas near data centers are seeing distorted power flows. A Bloomberg analysis showed that homes close to data centers had way worse power quality, even if they were in low-density areas. Bad harmonics also lead to billions of dollars in equipment failures, repairs, and lost productivity. It’s a slow bleed that’s adding up fast. Utilities like Dominion Energy and Exelon’s Commonwealth Edison are trying to downplay the issue. Dominion claims its systems are within industry standards, while ComEd outright disputes Whisker Labs’ findings. But here’s the problem, utilities often rely on outdated measurement tools that miss the granular, home-level data captured by Whisker Labs. So while utilities say everything is fine, residents are dealing with flickering lights, blown-out appliances, and rising repair bills.

Over the past few days, DOGE has experienced a significant drop, but recent consolidation, continuous accumulation by whales, and a shift in market sentiment might be driving potential upside momentum. Can Dogecoin (DOGE) Break $0.36? Key Levels to Watch Amid market uncertainty and ongoing consolidation, DOGE has formed a descending triangle pattern on the four-hour timeframe and is poised for a breakout. DOGE Price Prediction According to expert technical analysis, if the meme coin breaches this pattern and closes a candle above the $0.327 mark on the same timeframe, there is a strong possibility it could surge by 11% to reach $0.36 in the near future. Source: Trading View However, this speculation is based on a short timeframe and could appear in the coming days. On the daily timeframe, DOGE appears to be consolidating within a tight range below the crucial support level of $0.36. Based on recent price action, if DOGE breaks out of this narrow zone and closes a daily candle above the $0.36 mark, there is a strong possibility it could surge by 30% to reach $0.465 in the coming days. Source: Trading View Whales Accumulate 90 Million DOGE Amid this ongoing consolidation, whales have demonstrated strong interest and confidence in the meme coin. According to a prominent crypto expert’s post on X (formerly Twitter), whales have purchased a significant 90 million DOGE tokens. This substantial accumulation by whales has the potential to create buying pressure and drive further upside momentum.

Personal data security firm Leakd says it’s discovered five terabytes of screenshots online containing five million unique credit card and debit card numbers, as well as financial records and personal information. According to Leakd’s security team, the exposed data stash specifically contains users’ full names, billing addresses, email addresses, phone numbers and credit card details. While the firm says the entity behind the large data leak continues to remain anonymous, it notes that many of the screenshots bear the logo of Braniacshop, a “definitely questionable” website, according to Scam Detector . Leakd also says that the party responsible may have launched a deliberate data-harvesting campaign after discovering many instances involving “too-good-to-be-true” promotional offers. “The leaked screenshots often featured instances of users entering personal and financial details into seemingly innocent promotional forms. These offers, promising rewards like a free iPhone 14 or heavily discounted items, were just traps. With prices as low as $3, they often hid deceptive disclaimers about trial periods and auto-renewal charges.” Source: Leakd.com Leakd estimates that the potential financial value of the looted data trove could be worth north of $85 million. The firm says users who think their data may have been exposed can take several steps to protect themselves including monitoring financial accounts for suspicious activity, setting up fraud alerts and freezing credit to stop scammers from opening fraudulent accounts.

On the social media platform X, Glassnode examines the Realized Cap metric, which records the price at which each coin was last moved and aims to gauge how many holders are in profit or at a loss. The firm points out the monthly percent change in realized cap for each of the three assets. “This metric acts as an indicator of the rate and direction of capital inflows or outflows for these assets. During the recent market downtrend, the monthly rate of change in Realized Cap for SOL has plunged below both BTC and ETH. This indicates a faster decline in momentum for Solana compared to the other two assets. Current monthly Realized Cap Change (%/30D): • BTC: +10.87% • ETH: +5.43% • SOL: +2.19%.” Source: Glassnode/X But Glassnode noted earlier this week that Solana has maintained a positive net capital inflow since early September 2023, with only minor periods of outflow. “This sustained influx of liquidity has assisted in stimulating growth and price appreciation, achieving a remarkable peak inflow of $776 million of new capital per day.” SOL is trading at $186.12 at time of writing.

As the XRP price starts on this trajectory, the WallitIQ (WLTQ) Ripple rival’s staggering leap from $0.0243 to $100 further fuels the race for dominance. With its groundwork laid, the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale presents the next wave of opportunities for proactive investors. The XRP Price Eyes $1,000, But WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) $100 Target Attracts Investors The XRP price is making headlines in an impending revolution in the crypto landscape. According to an insider with strong connections to the XRP price, this altcoin is on an extraordinary path toward a $1,000 valuation in this market cycle. The insider pointed out that the landmark court victory against the SEC earlier this year has set a remarkable pace for the XRP price, establishing momentum like never before. With regulatory clarity affirming its status, the XRP price emerged as a beacon of legitimacy in a market that craves trust. Moreover, the insider’s roadmap reveals that expanding partnerships with major financial institutions is the cornerstone of this ambitious trajectory of the XRP price. According to the insider, the XRP price’s recent integration with the European Central Bank’s digital euro project signals the XRP price rising role as the backbone of global payment infrastructure. However, the fame of the Ripple rival, WallitIQ (WLTQ), has risen over this insider’s lofty projection. For a token valued at $0.0243, a rally to $100 will deliver over a 400,000% rally — a move that will make thousands of investors crypto millionaires. With a total supply of 1 billion tokens, many investors believe WallitIQ (WLTQ) can realistically reach $100, leading to a total market capitalization of $100 billion. In contrast, the insider’s roadmap indicates that the XRP price could attain a staggering $57 trillion market cap upon hitting $1,000. This assumption would be faulty, as a valuation that size is larger than the entire cryptocurrency market. Moreover, investors are keen on the Ripple rival WallitIQ (WLTQ) because 20% of its tokenomics is allocated to rewarding early adopters and active investors. The previous presale stage sold out quickly, and the current stage is now over 90% sold out within just a few days, raising more than $3 million. Investors who have eyes on this Ripple rival have set their sights on a fortune that only decisive action will deliver. As such, they are investing in the WallitIQ (WLTQ) Ripple rival now as the surefire path to financial freedom. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) Innovative Edge In The Crypto Market Any token targeting a 400,000% increase must have expansive innovation to back its ascent. One of WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) extraordinary features is its AI smart suggestions. This tool empowers investors to maximize profitability through strategic portfolio rebalancing and insights into optimal trading times. Similarly, the provision of learning materials helps investors find the documentation needed to learn the intricacies of DeFi. With this knowledge, investors continue to refine their strategies to stay relevant in the market. Furthermore, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has bolstered investor confidence by completing a smart contract audit with SolidProof , a leading auditing firm, confirming that WallitIQ (WLTQ) is free from vulnerabilities to malicious attacks. Conclusion The insider’s roadmap paints a promising picture for the XRP price, positioning it to reach $1,000 in this market cycle. However, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is investors’ preferred investment path. As a Ripple rival, this AI coin is poised to thrive amid growing interest in the AI sector. To be part of this wealth creation, investors must realize that they must beat time and thousands of other investors looking to buy WallitIQ (WLTQ) Ripple rival token. In the race, fortune favors only the swift and decisive who buy WallitIQ (WLTQ) now at $0.0243 .

While BTC and the altcoin market continue to struggle, Solana memecoin Husky Inu (HINU) generated over $680,000 in its presale. Bitcoin Loses Steam Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) recently reached a high of 60.1% but has declined to around 50%. While a decline in BTC’s dominance was expected, a surge in altcoins was also expected. The past time has, however, revealed that the crypto market at large is losing steam, but top altcoins are stepping up to claim their share of the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin Dominance measures BTC's relative share or dominance in the overall crypto sector. This measure represents the percentage of Bitcoin’s total market cap compared to the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies combined. Bitcoin currently trades for $94,916 – representing a weekly loss of over 2.6%. Dogecoin (DOGE): The OG Memecoin Dogecoin (DOGE), the top memecoin by market cap, exploded after Donald Trump’s victory over Kamala Harris in the US presidential election. DOGE ranks as the 7th largest crypto with a market cap exceeding $47.4 billion, and further gains are expected in the coming months. DOGE quickly rose through the ranks to become a household name in the crypto industry, owing its success to a strong community spurred by the involvement and endorsement of Elon Musk. The tech mogul is the world’s richest man, CEO of Tesla, and owner of social media platform X (formerly Twitter). Musk joined the Trump campaign, playing an integral role in the president-elect’s victory, and his involvement with the party could see DOGE run to new heights as the Trump administration comes into power. DOGE’s value stepped into overdrive after Donald Trump released a statement naming Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy as the leads of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. According to Trump, DOGE will pave the way for his administration to “dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditure, and restructure Federal Agencies – Essential to the “Save America” Movement.” Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) is one of the top-selling memecoins with a market cap exceeding $13 billion. The decentralized community-led token and its reputation as the “Dogecoin Killer” has yielded impressive rewards in the past year, gaining over 108%. SHIB is also a proud member of the Solana network and is Husky Inu’s best friend. The memecoin quickly rose to fame in the crypto industry and has since become a household name. SHIB, launched in 2020, is currently the 14th largest crypto by market cap and the second biggest memecoin after Dogecoin (DOGE). This decentralized, community-led project and its native token, SHIB, quickly gained the attention of its dedicated community of investors thanks to its charm and support from industry giants such as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Husky Inu (HINU) Likely to Benefit on Timing Market onlookers and crypto enthusiasts reacted positively to the end of Gary Gensler’s brutal and belligerent regime. Under Gensler, several large crypto firms and prominent industry figures faced regulatory scrutiny and enforcement action, which drove many to seek refuge off US shores. Donald Trump won the hearts of a large part of the industry with a promise to make the US the world’s crypto capital, and the relief brought by this promise is reflected in current market behaviour. The renewed optimism toward digital assets will likely benefit new projects as investors regain trust and confidence in the industry. Husky Inu (HINU), the latest memecoin sensation from the Solana network, will surely reap the rewards of industry news. Husky Inu recently launched the presale of its native token, HINU , with tremendous success, and the two are on a mission to conquer the memecoin industry through a robust and supportive community with innovative features and enhanced rewards. Since going live, the presale has generated over $686,000, with numbers expected to rise rapidly as the crypto market explodes. Husky Inu is working on some exciting things, including an Earn App and a Decentralized Exchange. The Earn App will reward users with HINU tokens for engaging with the project, and the Decentralized Exchange will facilitate decentralized trading to improve utility and value for HINU holders. Husky Inu boasts several unique features that set it apart from traditional investment opportunities, including a capped token supply, a deflationary mechanism, speedy transactions, and charity voting. Join the HINU presale now to enjoy the immense potential of the burgeoning crypto sector.

The leading crypto asset price has been unstable for the past two weeks, trading sideways. Currently, it is trading at around $95,114, showing a 1.16% drop in just 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap data. Analytics firms are taking notice, with some even predicting a crash might be on the horizon. Bitcoin’s Path Stirs Market Worries Analysts like IT Tech from Cryptoquant have recently pointed out that certain market indicators suggest a shift might be coming soon. One key indicator is Bitcoin’s spot exchange reserves, which had declined for a while but recently increased. In a short time, 20,000 BTC were moved onto exchanges, meaning investors may be getting ready to trade or sell their Bitcoin. This movement can create selling pressure, which could lead to a drop in Bitcoin’s price. Bitcoin’s reserves on exchanges are not just rising; the overall flow of Bitcoin into exchanges has also increased. Recently, 15,800 BTC entered exchanges, reversing the trend of more Bitcoin being withdrawn than deposited. This shift is called a positive netflow, often showing investors preparing to trade or sell their Bitcoin. When reserves go up, and netflows turn positive, investors might plan to take profits or expect Bitcoin’s price to drop soon. These combined signals hint at a possible change in the market. Bitcoin Whales and Retail Traders Shows Caution Alike Bitcoin’s recent market trends do not just reflect the actions of retail traders. Bitcoin whale holders are also making moves . Over the past week, the amount of Bitcoin these whales sent to exchanges increased significantly, with the exchange netflow rising from -0.04% to 0.27%. This means more of their Bitcoin is being moved onto exchanges. This trend often signals upcoming selling and a shift toward bearish sentiment. What’s Next for Bitcoin? Bitcoin’s NVT (Network Value to Transaction) ratio is a key indicator to track the asset’s price trajectory. This has recently jumped to a noticeable 1010.02. The NVT ratio measures the relationship between Bitcoin’s market cap and its daily transaction volume. A spike in the NVT ratio means Bitcoin’s price is rising faster than network usage. This often signals a price correction ahead as the market realigns. With these signs of caution, Bitcoin’s short-term outlook is uncertain. If reserves keep rising and netflows remain positive, the market could see more volatility and selling pressure, possibly lowering Bitcoin’s price. Support levels are crucial. If Bitcoin drops below $92,700, it could fall to $86,000. Market sentiment is changing, and a correction may be near. Investors are advised to watch closely for potential volatility ahead.

Others believe that Bitcoin will eventually replace traditional reserve systems, but according to Ki Young Ju, the U.S. is far from embracing such a shift given its economic dominance and reliance on the dollar. Recently, the idea of the United States adopting Bitcoin as a strategic asset has come forward, but not everybody agrees that it will happen soon. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju joined the discussion on the U.S. introducing Bitcoin into its financial plan. Ju said gold has often been presented as a solution whenever the United States felt threatened by a loss of global economic dominance. The gold price has risen as uncertainty has surrounded the U.S. economy, and the debate about going back to the gold standard never really subsided. In the 1990s, Peter Schiff argued that gold is the “true form of money,” and today, Bitcoin advocates claim that Bitcoin can replace all other forms of money. These advocates see Bitcoin as a way to achieve financial freedom and global economic stability. Despite some calls to bring back the gold standard, no effort has succeeded in doing so in the United States. Instead, the U.S. has always found other ways to handle crises and keep growing. Bitcoin is taking the place gold once held in people’s minds. According to Ki Young Ju, the future of finance is unlikely to see Bitcoin as an important player in the immediate future, though it may one day become a strategic asset for the U.S. In other words, serious consideration by the U.S. as a reserve asset will depend on a real threat to its global economic supremacy. U.S. dollar’s dominance in global trade Despite the changing global economy, the U.S. stands strong, and the dollar remains the first choice of international trade. Though, at the same time, it is possible that the U.S. may be using Bitcoin as a sort of backup for the dollar or to gain economic benefit, Ju points out that the reasons behind such a step would likely be very far from what Bitcoin supporters could imagine. Ju’s skepticism towards the U.S. adopting Bitcoin as a strategic asset is mainly because the country still relies on the dollar. With capital flowing to the U.S. from anywhere worldwide, money is still pouring into dollar accounts. This is even as Bitcoin and other so-called cryptocurrencies rise to unparalleled heights, and many folks see the dollar as at least a better store of value than all of that stuff. Examples are countries such as South Korea, which for years have been opting to store U.S. dollars instead of Bitcoin or gold as their currencies, the Korean won, continue to decline. This proves that at least the U.S. dollar will remain a reserve currency for the future. However, there are emerging voices across the U.S. calling for a course change in its monetary policy, and even President-elect Donald Trump has been quoted as supporting Bitcoin, with public statements made valuing the virtual currency during his presidential run. As Ju points out, things could change, especially with bigger policy issues ahead. The U.S. might still buy Bitcoin to strengthen its economy or manage risks. However, Ju believes it’s unlikely that the U.S. will treat Bitcoin as a core reserve asset, as some Bitcoin supporters hope. Instead, he would be far more concerned with the diversification of schemes rather than considering Bitcoin a core base of the financial systems of the government. Ju’s analysis holds true for the fact that most governments have yet to adopt Bitcoin. While nations like El Salvador and Bhutan have adopted Bitcoin within their respective economies, nations like Japan could not consider Bitcoin to be added as a national reserve. Instead, Japan has strengthened its economy by using more traditional approaches than risking its exploration with Bitcoin. This is because it cannot take a risk with the volatility of Bitcoin and the uncertainty it carries as to its long-term value as a stable asset. Companies lead Bitcoin adoption On the other hand, private companies have been much faster in adapting to the idea of Bitcoin in their financial strategy. Big firms such as MicroStrategy, MARA Holdings, and RIOT Platforms continue to buy Bitcoin steadily. These companies buy Bitcoin to hedge against inflation and to diversify their investments. These firms have steadily accumulated substantial Bitcoin holdings, reflecting a growing shift in how institutional investors perceive and value cryptocurrency as a key asset. Companies such as Metaplanet, for instance, recently bought more than 600 Bitcoin, adding to their reserves, now at almost 1,800 BTC. This is why more people in private firms may embrace it, but the U.S. government is more hesitant. The U.S. may look into a reserve of Bitcoin in the long run. Still, it will remain one of the assets that the individual investors and companies would hold onto rather than a vital component of the U.S. government’s financial plan. Though the surge in popularity and adoption of Bitcoin is undeniable, it appears that the U.S. will not immediately make Bitcoin a strategic asset. The dollar remains dominant and the U.S. holds a strong position in the global economy, making it hard to argue for an immediate shift towards Bitcoin as a reserve asset. However, as the maturing of the cryptocurrency market and more institutions and private firms invest in Bitcoin, the U.S. government might reassess its position. For now, Bitcoin is a niche asset and not a mainstream reserve currency for the U.S. Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",Bitcoin News & Insights|BTC|USA,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-28 21:15:04

As 2025 approaches, these cryptos are at the forefront, transforming decentralized finance, smart contracts, and cross-border payments. But choosing from thousands of options can be daunting. It requires a smart approach to decide which cryptos to add to one's portfolio, regardless of one's familiarity with the cryptocurrency sphere. This guide highlights the top altcoins to consider by 2025, including Stellar (XLM), BlockDAG (BDAG), Chainlink (LINK), Avalanche (AVAX), and Ripple (XRP). So, let’s explore the key reasons these cryptos are the best choices. BlockDAG: World’s Most Advanced Blockchain Crypto BlockDAG (BDAG) leads the list as a pioneering layer-1 blockchain project, with its successful presale, which has already amassed over $173 million, making it one of the most-discussed new crypto projects. Currently, in its 26th batch, BlockDAG’s native coin BDAG is priced at $0.0234, offering early participants a 2240% ROI. Market experts suggest the coin could rise to $1 by 2025. Crypto enthusiasts are currently snapping up BDAG coins, taking advantage of its substantial BDAG400 bonus, starting at 250%. BlockDAG’s innovative structure uses Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology, enabling faster transactions, unmatched scalability, and lower costs than traditional blockchains. BlockDAG also offers an efficient, secure system for its miners that lowers energy use without compromising security. With a range of mining rigs from the X1 mobile app to the more advanced X10, X30, and X100, BlockDAG supports eco-friendly mining for both experienced and new miners. By filling the gaps left by current crypto solutions, BlockDAG proves to be a prime choice for both miners and buyers, offering promising returns and standout functionality, making it the top altcoin to buy now. Stellar (XLM): Streamlining Global Payments Stellar (XLM) continues to expand its blockchain ecosystem through partnerships with Paxos and Etherfuse. Known for quick transactions, low fees, multi-currency support, and a decentralized exchange, Stellar is set to improve cross-border payments. Currently priced around $0.3881, XLM is gaining traction among the top altcoins to buy now. Experts foresee a potential price rise in 2025 as Stellar’s network becomes known for efficient and accessible financial solutions, confirming its place among the top altcoins to consider for 2025. Chainlink (LINK): Secure Oracle Integration Chainlink is advancing by teaming up with entities such as Banco Inter and Microsoft to boost trade finance. Its latest venture into the zkSync ecosystem with a cross-chain interoperability protocol underscores its dedication to advancing technology, even during slow market periods. Key features of Chainlink include decentralized oracles, secure data feeds, and hybrid smart contracts that connect blockchain technology with practical, real-world data applications. These innovations position LINK as among the top altcoins crypto for 2025. Currently, LINK is priced at about $24.82, and it is anticipated to experience further growth in 2025 due to its increasing usage. Avalanche (AVAX): Rapid & Low-Cost Transactions Avalanche has seen significant developments with its latest updates, like the Avalanche9000 mainnet upgrade that cut fees by more than 90% and secured $250 million for its Layer-1 improvement. Its main attributes are high throughput, low latency, customizable subnets, and compatibility with Ethereum. Priced around $40.95 now, AVAX may witness growth in 2025 as its growing ecosystem and collaborations continue to boost its presence in DeFi and business applications, making it a considerable option among the top altcoins for 2025. Ripple (XRP): Fast Financial Bridging XRP has experienced variability in a fluctuating market, with a current price of around $2.29. Recent updates show a potential positive shift in regulatory perspective with the likely resolution of the SEC lawsuit, enhancing confidence in the crypto. XRP is characterized by quick transactions, low costs, and a distinctive consensus algorithm on the decentralized XRP Ledger. Its capability for handling scalability and cross-border payments via RippleNet makes XRP a preferred choice for global financial bodies. It is projected to see steady growth in 2025, marking it as one of the top altcoins to buy now . Summing Up the Top Altcoins for 2025 While Stellar, Chainlink, Avalanche, and Ripple all show strong potential, BlockDAG sets itself apart with its innovative technology and focus on environmental sustainability. Its blockchain technology facilitates swift transactions and addresses ongoing issues like scalability and energy efficiency. With its presale already garnering over $173 million and aiming for a $600 million goal, BlockDAG is establishing itself as the leading pick for those seeking the top altcoin for 2025.

With Hyperliquid, Solana, and Rollblock as some of the top options, those early retirement plans could turn into reality. HYPE showcases potential in decentralized finance, SOL continues to lead with its high-speed blockchain, and the new crypto RBLK is maxing out on a niche in web3 applications. This article explores why these projects could be pivotal for achieving life-changing returns in 2025. Rollblock Offers More Than 150 Profit Opportunities Rollblock merges blockchain technology with online gaming, creating a decentralized ecosystem powered by the RBLK token. The platform offers users access to games and a transparent rewards system. By leveraging blockchain’s speed and security, Rollblockensures seamless transactions and eliminates traditional barriers in online gambling. A weekly revenue-sharing model also sets Rollblock further apart. Users who stake RBLK earn a share of the platform’s weekly earnings, directly linking participation to financial returns. This model encourages user involvement and provides a consistent stream of rewards. Notably, Rollblock enhances its utility through staking bonuses of up to 30% APY and cashback rewards. To maintain token value, Rollblock integrates deflationary mechanisms such as buybacks and burns, reducing the circulating supply of RBLK over time. This approach balances demand and supply, driving long-term value appreciation. With over 150 games in its arsenal, Rollblock can easily capitalize on the hype of the iGaming industry. HYPE Hits 1,050% Price Increase in Just 25 Days Hyperliquid (HYPE) broke records in 2024 with a 1,050% price increase just 25 days after its listing on CoinMarketCap. Just like its price, HYPE’s trading volume and user adoption keep hitting new highs. Analysts are yet to figure out its price ceiling as HYPE’s price is forecasted to rise by 240% by January 25, 2025. HYPE’s unique mechanism for pooling liquidity across decentralized exchanges gives it a significant edge in the DeFi market. Its integration of AI-driven market-making and automated yield strategies enhances efficiency for traders and liquidity providers. With over $8.2 billion in market cap, HYPE could enter the top 20 cryptocurrencies in early 2025. Analysts Predict SOL Breakout Above $221 Solana (SOL) is not left out of the record-breaking. This year, SOL outperformed its biggest competitor, ETH, in on-chain activities and percentage increase in capital. With Solana’s layer-2 blockchain Sonic airdropping to select users, SOL is forecasted to retest the resistance at $198 and even cross $221 by January end. Moreover, SOL’s staking rewards and developer-friendly infrastructure continue to attract institutional and retail interest alike. With speculations of a Solana ETF approval in 2025, analysts see the potential for SOL to break its previous all-time high, making it a key asset to watch. Conclusion While SOL and HYPE have the potential to skyrocket in 2025, Rollblock provides better returns on investment as a new crypto. Through its ongoing presale, RBLK is valued at a generous rate of $0.044 each.

38240725,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=667904,1735421437,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,"Crypto Market Remains Greedy Despite Bitcoin Price Crash To $94,000, Is A Recovery Coming?",https://www.newsbtc.com/crypto/crypto-market-bitcoin-price/,"You could argue that the cryptocurrency market maintains its confidence despite the Bitcoin price experiencing a significant drop to $94,000. Although price action says otherwise, this confidence is highlighted through various predictions from crypto analysts on social media and on TradingView, which cuts across various cryptocurrencies. Amidst the price decline and market optimism, the Crypto Market Fear and Greed Index continues to point to greed, which leans toward the idea of a momentary dip before a broader recovery. Bitcoin Price Crash Stalls Bullish Momentum The crypto industry has largely exhibited bullish momentum throughout 2024, with many cryptocurrencies reaching new multi-year highs. This momentum was led by Bitcoin, which broke through its 2021 all-time high of $69,000 in the middle of 2024 to eventually break above the $100,000 psychological level for the first time on December 5. Related Reading: Historical Data Shows What To Expect From Ethereum Price In Q1 2025 – It’s Very Bullish However, Bitcoin’s price action since crossing over the six-digit price threshold has been mostly full of corrections. Although it peaked at $108,135 on December 17, the past 12 days or so have been highlighted by price declines. Notably, Bitcoin has corrected as low as $92,600 in the past seven days, essentially leading to a cascade of declines among other cryptocurrencies and stalling the bullish momentum. Bitcoin’s descent has surprised many crypto traders, considering its strong rally in recent months. Analysts attribute this correction to profit-taking by a few long-term holders and a temporary slowdown in market activity. Crypto Market Sentiment Stays In Greed Despite recent price declines, HODLing trends suggest that the cryptocurrency market remains on track to sustain its rally into 2025. This sentiment is reflected in the Fear and Greed Index, which continues to hover in the greed zone, signaling confidence among investors. The index is derived from a combination of key metrics, including market volatility, trading volume, social media sentiment, Bitcoin dominance, Google search trends, and surveys. Each component is carefully weighted to gauge the market’s psychological state. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Retests Support Line After Crash Below $95,000, Here’s The Next Target At the time of writing, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index, according to alternative.me, is at a reading of 72, which is in the Greed threshold. This relays investor confidence across the various market indicators and suggests that traders perceive the dip as a buying opportunity rather than a cause for panic. This greed sentiment is relayed through a few buying trends across notable cryptocurrencies. For example, on-chain data from crypto analytics company Santiment shows that Dogecoin whales have bought over 90 million DOGE tokens in the past 48 hours. With this in mind, analysts are optimistic about a broader market recovery in the coming weeks. Technical indicators point to a rebound led by Bitcoin if it can continue to hold above support levels around $92,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $94,400 and is down by 12.8% since it reached $108,135 on December 17. According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, such corrections (between 20% and 30%) are the best thing to always happen to Bitcoin in every bull cycle.

Homosexual Pepe (HOMOPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homosexual Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homosexual Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Homosexual Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homosexual Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homosexual Pepe by entering its contract address – 92xPeBxtanptFH9AYsRtwRMq7cWWw9GHfxaspwpNvCTP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-28 21:46:46
38241539,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=634381,1735422636,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38241539.jpeg,US Treasury to hit new debt ceiling before Trump’s inauguration as the crisis worsens,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/us-treasury-to-hit-new-debt-ceiling-before-trumps-inauguration-as-the-crisis-worsens/,"The United States is staring down the barrel of another financial crisis, with the Treasury Department confirming it will hit a new debt ceiling just days before Donald Trump returns to the White House. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen sent a warning to Congress, saying the debt limit will reset to match the current $36 trillion in national debt on January 2, 2025. A small $54 billion reduction in federal trust fund securities will provide a sliver of breathing room, but that will disappear fast. By mid-January, the Treasury will be forced to use “extraordinary measures” to keep the government’s lights on. Yellen’s message was that lawmakers must act to raise or eliminate the debt ceiling, or the U.S. will face financial disaster. “I respectfully urge Congress to act to protect the full faith and credit of the United States,” she wrote. But with a politically divided Capitol and tensions rising, the solution is far from clear. Interest payments are swallowing the budget If the growing national debt was a fire, interest payments would be the gasoline. In the past year alone, the U.S. spent $1.15 trillion on interest payments alone. To put it plainly, that’s more than the country spent on defense and healthcare combined—by $300 billion. Interest costs have doubled in just three years, and they’re climbing fast. At this rate, interest payments will overtake Social Security as the government’s biggest expense in the next three years. The Treasury is now America’s biggest borrower, but even it can’t keep up with the Federal Reserve’s relentless high rates. Without congressional action, the U.S. will hit its borrowing cap by January 14 to 23. After that, the government won’t be able to issue new debt, leaving it incapable of paying its bills. Federal programs like Social Security, Medicare, and even military operations could face massive funding cuts. Trump calls for a radical fix Trump broke with Republican tradition by backing the idea of eliminating the debt ceiling altogether. In his words: “The Democrats have said they want to get rid of it. If they want to get rid of it, I would lead the charge.” Trump pushed for Congress to include a debt ceiling provision in its end-of-year funding bill, threatening primary challenges against Republicans who opposed him. But despite his influence, 170 Republicans defied him, leaving the debt ceiling fight for his incoming administration. The divide in Washington is as sharp as ever. Democrats argue that the debt ceiling is an outdated tool that only creates unnecessary crises. Republicans, on the other hand, see it as a bargaining chip to rein in government spending. Trump has blurred the lines, creating new tensions within his own party. The economic fallout The timing couldn’t be worse. The U.S. economy is already grappling with rising inflation, high interest rates, and slowing growth. GDP is projected to grow by 2.7% this year, but that’s expected to drop to 1.7% by 2026. Consumer spending, the backbone of the economy, has slowed to a crawl. In October, spending rose by just 0.1% month-over-month, a drop from the stronger gains earlier this year. Unemployment is creeping up too, now sitting at 4.25%. Companies are cutting back on hiring, and wage growth is slowing. The labor force participation rate is declining, leaving more Americans out of work or underemployed. Even consumer confidence is tanking. The Consumer Confidence Index fell by 8.1 points in December, signaling that Americans are increasingly pessimistic about the economy. Inflation, while stabilizing at around 2.3%, is still eating into household savings. Personal income rose by just 0.3% in November, and the savings rate is now at a meager 4.4%.

Recent Tron (TRX) news underscores breakthroughs in AI technology, while Sui market analysis indicates a promising future for sustained growth. Moreover, the partnership between BlockDAG Network and Inter Milan aims to broaden its already extensive community of over 170,000 holders by integrating blockchain with global sports platforms. These developments highlight varied strategies and underline the significant impact of visibility and adoption in propelling the crypto sector forward. From Tron’s initiatives in streamlining process creation to the broadening applications of Sui and the notable milestones achieved by BlockDAG’s presale, each project sheds light on critical aspects of the blockchain environment. For those keen on the market dynamics, BlockDAG (BDAG) stands out as a primary crypto coin to monitor closely into 2025. Tron News: Launch of AI-Driven Features The latest Tron news reveals the introduction of its inaugural AI agent on the Sun Pump platform, a pivotal development that allows for the automated generation and real-time modification of process parameters. This update, along with Tron’s collaboration with Bitget, a top cryptocurrency exchange, marks an essential phase in expanding its network’s ecosystem. This integration with AI technology is designed to simplify process creation and elevate user experiences, enhancing both usability and reliability through unique identifiers for each process. Following these updates, TRX has seen a significant uptick in its market value, reaffirming its current relevance and potential growth. Sui Market Analysis: Poised to Challenge Top Contenders Recent Sui market analysis points to the potential of this blockchain to soon contend with major cryptocurrency players. Despite fluctuations in price, Sui has shown considerable growth this past year, with its total value locked significantly increasing since September. The use of the Move programming language is a key factor simplifying development on the Sui platform. The analysis of Sui’s market also highlights robust fundamentals, including escalating adoption rates and strategic partnerships, such as those with USDC and Revolut. Despite the volatile price trends, many in the trading community view Sui as possibly undervalued. Given its strong developer support and expanding practical applications, forecasts suggest Sui is on track for considerable expansion in the upcoming year. BlockDAG’s Alliance with Inter Milan Elevates Global Crypto Visibility The collaboration between BlockDAG and the iconic Italian soccer team Inter Milan has made BlockDAG a highly anticipated crypto coin to watch . This partnership has greatly increased visibility, introducing BlockDAG’s advanced blockchain technology and its potential for substantial growth to millions of soccer enthusiasts globally. Analysts anticipate that this collaboration will boost the ongoing presale of BlockDAG, which has already achieved significant outcomes. The network has successfully raised over $173 million and distributed over 17.5 billion coins to date. Presently, during presale Batch 26, the price of BDAG is at $0.0234. Early participants have realized a ROI of 2240%, underscoring the project’s promising future. BlockDAG’s utilization of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology facilitates quick, scalable, and secure transactions, distinguishing it as a frontrunner in blockchain technology. The network’s versatility extends across DeFi, gaming, and NFT sectors, providing a broad platform for developers and traders. This multimillion-dollar agreement with Inter Milan provides unique, blockchain-enhanced engagement opportunities for fans and additional benefits for BDAG holders, enhancing the appeal and success of the presale. This partnership merges cutting-edge blockchain technology with a globally renowned sports brand, enhancing overall adoption and interest among traders. In the upcoming weeks, it is anticipated to increase BlockDAG’s community of 170,000 holders, further cementing its position in the crypto presale market. Key Crypto Coins to Monitor: A Year-End Review As the year draws to a close, Tron (TRX) news, Sui market analysis, and BlockDAG’s strategic alliances emphasize the advanced power of blockchain, marking them as the top crypto coins to watch currently. Tron’s enhancements in AI technology have streamlined process creation, improving user experiences and indicating continuous advancements within the network. Sui market analysis highlights its consistent growth and extended collaborations, showcasing its strong potential within the blockchain arena. Moreover, BlockDAG’s partnership with Inter Milan not only magnifies its presale achievements and global presence but also integrates BlockDAG into the lives of millions of soccer fans, expanding its reach and influence.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $16.21 by the end of 2027. By 2030, WIF’s price may surge to $23.65. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance, and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to a crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins expected to hit the market soon. Having closed in on the $5 mark on March 31, 2024, and also recaptured $4 post-U.S. elections in November, can WIF reach $10 soon? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $1.908 Market cap $1,904,301,106.83 Trading volume $235,805,446.55 Circulating supply 998,844,741.24 WIF All-time high $4.85 on March 31, 2024 All-time low $0.0677 on January 8, 2024 24-hour high $1.96 24-hour low $1.80 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Prediction $6.42 (232.15%) Volatility (30-day Variation) 20.80% 50-day SMA $2.97 14-Day RSI 33.01 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 72 (Greed) Green days 12/30 (40%) 200-Day SMA $2.31 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis: Will WIF recapture $2 soon? TL;DR Breakdown WIF’s price analysis shows consolidation with tightening Bollinger Bands in the short time. Dogwifhat (WIF) resistance is present at around $1.977. WIF’s support level is present at $1.777. The Dogwifhat price analysis for December 28 shows a slight recovery from intense bear pressure. Despite the 4% gain in the past few hours, the possibility of further downsides still looms. WIF shows signs of recovery, with a 0.86% gain in 7 days. However, the 30-day price dynamics show a 37.788% price drop. Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart: WIF shows slight recovery but remains below SMA The 1-day price analysis for WIF shows a slight recovery, with the price currently at $1.908, up 4.43%. While the increase is notable, the token remains below the key $1.950 SMA, suggesting the broader trend is still under pressure. WIF shows slight recovery but remains below SMA The RSI at 33.99 signals oversold conditions, indicating that the price may see additional upward momentum as buyers step in. The MACD remains bearish, with the histogram showing limited improvement. Combining these indicators suggests that the current upward movement may be limited unless stronger buying momentum develops. If WIF can break above $1.950, it could signal a stronger recovery, potentially pushing toward $2.00. Conversely, failure to maintain the current momentum may lead to a retest of support around $1.800. Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart: Indicators point to short-term bullish strength, but bears still maintain control The 4-hour price analysis for Dogwifhat (WIF) indicates mild consolidation. The Bollinger Bands show narrowing, with the upper band at $1.977 and the lower band at $1.777, signaling reduced volatility and potential for a breakout. WIF indicators point to short-term bullish strength, but bears still maintain control The price is trading slightly above the basis line at $1.877, indicating some short-term bullish strength. However, the Balance of Power (BoP) at -0.33 reflects that sellers are still maintaining a degree of control in the market. If WIF can break above the $1.977 resistance level, it could trigger a more decisive upward move. On the downside, a dip below $1.877 could push the price toward the lower Bollinger Band at $1.777, where stronger support is expected. Dogwifhat technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 2.35 SELL SMA 5 2.27 SELL SMA 10 2.18 SELL SMA 21 2.63 SELL SMA 50 2.97 SELL SMA 100 2.65 SELL SMA 200 2.31 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 2.26 SELL EMA 5 2.42 SELL EMA 10 2.66 SELL EMA 21 2.89 SELL EMA 50 2.91 SELL EMA 100 2.71 SELL EMA 200 2.47 SELL What to expect from WIF price analysis? If WIF breaks above $1.977, we could see a stronger recovery toward $2.00 or higher. However, failure to hold the $1.877 support could lead to a deeper pullback toward $1.777, aligning with bearish trends on the daily chart. Is Dogwifhat a good investment? Dogwifhat has experienced notable price fluctuations, particularly with a substantial increase in value in March, July, and October/November of 2024. While analysts hold diverse opinions on the future of this meme coin, the prevailing sentiment is optimistic. Projections indicate that by 2030, the price could rise to between $15 and $20. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank and several others. Why is $WIF down? After rebounding at $4.0013 due to price corrections, WIF is currently trading between $1.80 and $1.96. The current decline suggests that WIF is experiencing bearish momentum. Will WIF reach $10? Having touched $4.67 in November 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Analyst predictions suggest the token could surpass $10 as soon as 2026. Will WIF reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and would require exceptional growth, widespread adoption, and wild market speculation. Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $7 by 2025 and $20 by 2030. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

In its Anti-Scam Refund Initiative end-of-year report, the company outlined how it deployed cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies to transform digital asset security from reactive measures to proactive defense strategies. Anti-Scam Initiative According to the report , on average, the company processed about 80 successful fund recoveries monthly, totaling to about $9 million of stolen funds returned to victims in 2024. Additionally, it revealed that it made over 30,000 phone calls to warn potential targets of likely scams, with at least 15,000 alerts issued daily to platform users. The initiative’s efforts resulted in no less than 47,000 malicious addresses being blacklisted and, as of November, more than $129 million in annual funds prevented from being swindled. The key to Binance’s approach to stopping bad actors from stealing from its user base is a system that combines technological surveillance and human-centered support. In it, machine learning algorithms analyze complex transaction patterns in real-time, identifying potential criminal activities at super-fast speeds. It also employs AI-powered behavioral profiling to distinguish between legitimate user activity and potential illegal undertakings. The firm reported that it developed more than 50 specialized models and implemented 14 major upgrades to outmaneuver the fraudsters’ increasingly sophisticated tactics. Its Anti-Scam Refund Initiative operates through four pillars: proactive protection, 24-hour safety mechanisms, rapid response recovery, and support for silent victims. The one-day safety net allows users a cooling period for suspicious transactions, with funds moved to flagged accounts frozen to provide an opportunity for investigations and potential intervention. Binance’s Wins Over Crypto Thieves Since the beginning of the year, CryptoPotato has reported several incidents in which Binance’s intervention helped cryptocurrency users recover stolen funds. For instance, in October, the company aided Delhi police in taking down a digital asset scam ring in the city and recovering up to 100,000 USDT. Earlier in September, the exchange’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) helped authorities in the same country crack a scheme in which user funds amounting to $47.6 million were stolen from an online gaming platform and siphoned into several digital wallets. In August, the company announced that its risk management system had prevented more than $2.4 billion in losses from potential swindlers in the first half of 2024. About $1.1 billion of this was attributed to suspected criminal withdrawals, with another $73 million previously frozen due to external hacks.

Investments will focus on Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions, blockchain infrastructure, AI blockchain, DeFi, Web3, privacy, and tokenization. Robert Lay, the head of PitchBook, shared his expectations for crypto projects venture capital funding in 2025 in a recent interview with CNBC’s Crypto World . Although the year 2024 has been challenging, with a decrease in funding due to various reasons, such as the collapse of major players and higher interest rates, Lay remains optimistic about the industry’s future. Reflecting on 2024, Lay said the year started strong with good funding, especially after approving a Bitcoin ETF. That renewed positive sentiment brought venture capital back into the space. However, crypto investment momentum slowed as the year progressed. “Bitcoin kind of staggered a little bit, and there wasn’t a lot of activity, especially through the summer,” Lay said, adding that the 2024 venture capital amount will come in between $11 billion and $12 billion as projected, a 10 to 20 percent surge above the 2023 mark but still far less than what the world had hoped for going forward. Crypto VC funding expected to grow in 2025 Lay turns his focus to 2025 and is optimistic because the fundamentals are strong for this crypto market. Bitcoin had already touched all-time high numbers, and a more liberalizing regulatory environment was popping out of the woodwork. He also indicated that interest rates, although high , are likely to fall and thus further improve the investors’ outlook. “We’re expecting next year to be much stronger,” he stated, p redicting that VC funding for crypto could rise to $18 billion or more in 2025, representing an increase compared to 2024. Although this figure would still fall short of the nearly $30 billion invested in 2021 and 2022, it signals a clear rebound in interest and investment. The generalist investors have been relatively absent in recent years. Lay mentions that this group is back, and large financial institutions have a major role to play in this shift, along with close coordination with regulators to establish a more stable and credible environment for crypto. As the involvement from these institutions builds , the levels of trust within crypto should increase, resulting in additional dollars transferred into the ecosystem. When questioned on which areas crypto VC funding might focus on during 2025, Lay mentioned that, unlike during the last cycle, much attention was paid toward infrastructure and speculative sectors, including NFTs and Web3. Focus on r eal-world apps predicted to rise In contrast, during the following cycle, things may tilt toward applications. Lay noted that we expect to see more investments at the application layer. This means the focus will shift from infrastructure to real-world, user-friendly applications. S uch applications could be in industries where crypto infrastructure decentralizes traditional systems, such as mobility or energy data. Lay stressed that what’s lacking is more user-friendly platforms that allow people to get into crypto without having a deep understanding of the underlying technology. He compares it to the early internet days when infrastructure like AWS was set up, but the real value came when companies like Uber and Airbnb built on it. “In crypto, the real value will come from the applications, not just the infrastructure,” he said, pointing out the potential for real-world use and growth. A project that received major attention in 2024 is the development of Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions, which may help scale Bitcoin and make it more useful for everyday applications. Although there was much excitement early in the year, that progress has slowed, and technical challenges have hindered the development of scalable solutions. The development has been slower than anticipated, and whether Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions will come up to the mark is yet to be seen. Better regulations expected in 2025 When asked about the role of regulation in shaping the future of crypto, Lay acknowledged that though the regulatory environment remains a major concern, the situation has improved from previous years. He believed that if no new legislation is approved in the United States for 2025, that is enough , just having less restrictive rules from the legislator side . If more detailed legislation, such as a bill on stablecoin, enters into force, that will be a tremendous lift to the industry. “If Congress does nothing, I think that’s already a benefit compared to the last two years,” Lay concluded.

A chart shared by the analyst on X illustrates XRP’s current consolidation phase. It shows a bullish pattern that often precedes a breakout. The chart captures XRP trading in a descending triangle pattern following its substantial rally in November that sent it to its highest level since 2018. CryptoBull suggests that “the longer the consolidation, the stronger the move up,” implying that the asset’s price could surge soon. This aligns with the historical behavior of cryptocurrencies, where extended consolidation phases often result in explosive moves. The chart also showed how two brief consolidation periods helped XRP reach this peak of $2.86, and the extended consolidation following that could lead to a much larger price increase. #XRP will go up soon. The longer the consolidation, the stronger the move up pic.twitter.com/OcClBNdqrL — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) December 26, 2024 Potential Targets for XRP CryptoBull has been optimistic about XRP’s trajectory in the past. In a recent analysis, he projected that XRP could reach a new all-time high within two weeks . That analysis also emphasized that the ongoing consolidation phase is critical, serving as a foundation for the asset’s next upward move. CryptoBull noted that the digital asset has reached its bottom for the current run, and showed a similar consolidation triangle that would cause the surge in under two weeks. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Further, CryptoBull has outlined a potential path for XRP to hit $6 . He argues that XRP is completing a correctional pattern, which could set the stage for a sharp price increase. The analyst has previously pointed to XRP’s ability to sustain support levels during market volatility as evidence of its long-term bullish potential. Key Technical Levels and XRP’s Future Based on the shared chart, XRP’s immediate resistance lies near the $2.9 mark, with significant support at the $2 level. A breakout above the triangle’s resistance line could validate CryptoBull’s predictions, potentially driving the price to new heights. CryptoBull’s analysis has sparked interest among XRP investors and traders. His confidence in XRP’s performance is rooted in technical analysis and historical market trends, and many other analysts support the bullish outlook for the digital asset’s immediate future. The digital asset is trading at $2.17, after a minor increase of under 1% in the past 24 hours. However, it might not be here for long, as one analyst recently reiterated a target of $27 with a detailed path to this lofty target.

Prince Elon (ELONPRIN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONPRIN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Prince Elon can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Prince Elon could become the next viral memecoin. Prince Elon launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Prince Elon on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Prince Elon by entering its contract address – 7rAsmWGTtPFY9RFnhd9biard7PrWtw5ZigowwfmaXUQ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONPRIN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-28 22:58:00

Table of Contents Dogecoin’s recent price swings leave investors unsure about its performance in 2025 Cardano mimics 2020 trend that suggests it might surge to $6 Conclusion Irrespective of the industry, the goal of any investment is to make a profit. This is why crypto investors are constantly looking out for the next big altcoin that will yield massive profits. While Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano (ADA) are household names, a new contender, WallitIQ (WLTQ) , is dominating the market because it promises greater returns. Moreover, HSBC analysts believe it will stand out at the start of 2025 by hitting an impressive $10. You might also like: Bank of America manager says ADA not done, WallitIQ set for 77,000% breakout Here Is Why HSBC Analysts Are Confident WallitIQ Will Outpace Other Altcoins and Reach $10 in January 2025 WallitIQ is the undisputed king of this bull run, as HSBC analysts say it is poised to rise from $0.0243 to $10 by January 1st, 2025. This token is rewriting the rules of crypto investing because it uses artificial intelligence to help traders maximize their profit. So, those who are still on the sidelines risk missing the biggest crypto opportunity of the decade. One of the features driving WallitIQ’ s upcoming rise is how it helps people manage their digital assets. This token allows traders to trade over 1,000 cryptocurrencies from the comfort of their wallets. Also, it offers unmatched staking rewards. Users can earn a whopping 180% APY by simply staking their token. HSBC analysts laud WallitIQ as an effortless opportunity to make a juicy passive income. Token holders have governance rights to make their contribution or suggestions towards the platform’s future. The crypto market is already buzzing about WallitIQ’s potential. So, it is no surprise that its presale crossed the million-dollar milestone within days. With other perks like unlimited referral bonuses, community rewards, and ultra-low swap rates, crypto whales are pouring millions into the presale. WallitIQ is selling at $0.0243, and HSBC analysts have predicted it will skyrocket to $10 come January. A major contribution to these projections is that WallitIQ has proven to be a safe and trustworthy platform by completing its smart contracts audit with SolidProof. In other words, WallitIQ helps investors make huge profits and protects their interests while at it. WallitIQ’s presale is currently selling out at lightning speed, and today could be the last chance to grab the token at the low price of $0.0243. Do not let this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity pass by. With WallitIQ, the future of crypto is indeed here, but the big question is — how many will be a part of it? Dogecoin’s recent price swings leave investors unsure about its performance in 2025 Dogecoin has kept many investors on their toes because of its wild price swings. Currently, experts, including HSBC analysts, are uncertain about Dogecoin’s future in 2025. Even Dogecoin’s creator, Billy Markus, was asked about Dogecoin’s potential of an end-of-the-year peak, and his playful response was a “no idea” GIF. This perfectly captures the state of the Dogecoin’s market. Cardano mimics 2020 trend that suggests it might surge to $6 Cardano has captured the attention of crypto enthusiasts as its current price movements seem to mirror its 2020 bull rally pattern. Cardano is currently trading at $0.88 and battling to hold above a key support level of $0.76, a make-or-break point for a Cardano bullish momentum. Additionally, there are comments that Cardano has the potential to surge to $6. Cardano’s 38% increase in Total Value Locked (TVL) and upcoming upgrades like the Plomin hard fork, set to happen in January, are the basis for this sentiment. Conclusion Sometimes, declaring a crypto winner may prove difficult; however, that is not the case with WallitIQ . Although Dogecoin and Cardano have a level of optimism surrounding them, WallitIQ is in a league of its own. HSBC analysts’ prediction of an astronomical rise from $0.0243 to $10 by January 1 is proof of this token’s worth. With WallitIQ’s presale closing soon, this could be the last chance to act fast. Do not hesitate on the biggest crypto opportunity ever. Interested investors should act fast to buy the token now so they can count their fortune in the new year.

Despite multiple upward movements, Bitcoin struggled to break past the $100,000 resistance with its price performance in December continuing to deviate from earlier bullish predictions. Amidst this development, market analysts continue to roll out projections on Bitcoin’s potential price move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Surge: Are Traders Preparing For A Major Market Shift? Is Bitcoin Price Top In? In an X post on December 27, crypto technical analysis handle More Crypto Online shared an interesting prediction on Bitcoin in its current corrective state. Using the Elliott Wave Theory, these market analysts have drafted two opposing forecasts on the BTC market named the yellow and white scenarios. For context, the Elliott Wave Theory is a form of technical analysis that hinges on the belief that the financial market moves in repetitive fractal patterns called waves that can be used to predict future price movements. With Bitcoin presently in a corrective structure i.e. moving against the bullish market trend, the white scenario states Bitcoin has completed a B-wave in which it recorded a local price top on December 26th. Currently, the premier cryptocurrency is moving in a C-wave headed to a potential price target in the mid to low $80,000 price zone. The original support zone to counter this bearish movement is around $95,068 – $96,670. However, as Bitcoin establishes new lows, these resistance regions will be recalibrated. On the other hand, the yellow scenario shows that the B-wave, which is concluded in the white scenario, is still developing as part of a larger corrective structure with no price top yet recorded. However, for this yellow scenario to become valid, BTC needs to break above $96,673 signaling that an upward movement is still ongoing. Therefore, as long as this price zone remains unbroken, the white scenario remains the dominant outlook for the Bitcoin market. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Bull Run Over? What This Legendary Metric Says BTC Price Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $94,790, marking a 1.04% decline over the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, daily trading volume has risen by 10.35%, reaching $52.24 billion. After a week of near-balanced gains and losses, the leading cryptocurrency has dropped 2.00%, with its monthly performance also slipping into negative territory. For market bulls, moving above $96,600 remains the immediate task based on the Elliott Wave theory, however, a major opposition awaits at $100,000 which has proved an effective resistance in recent times. Generally, optimism continues to remain high in the Bitcoin market, especially with the inauguration of US President-elect Donald Trump fast approaching which is expected to herald in a new era of pro-crypto policies.

But what if there’s a superior option to enhance your shopping rewards? Enter the world of Web3Bay’s 3BAY tokens, a groundbreaking reward system poised to revolutionize e-commerce. These tokens surpass traditional gift cards by offering enhanced value, greater flexibility, and more growth opportunities, positioning them as the smarter choice for discerning shoppers today. The live Web3Bay presale presents an early opportunity for participants to secure tokens that provide much more than simple discounts. These tokens allow entry into a decentralized marketplace, offer exclusive advantages, and even grant a stake in the platform’s future, marking the dawn of a new e-commerce era.

These blockchain-enabled tokens can be utilized across Web3Bay’s decentralized marketplace or exchanged on various trading platforms, opening up substantial financial prospects for holders.

Furthermore, Web3Bay’s decentralized structure allows 3BAY tokens to adapt with ongoing innovations in blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi), providing opportunities that go far beyond what traditional gift cards can offer. Unrivaled Discounts and Rewards Web3Bay’s 3BAY tokens are crafted to elevate the shopping experience. Token holders enjoy a 5% discount on every purchase and gain rewards for their participation and engagement with the platform. These benefits accumulate, creating a continual value cycle that Amazon gift cards cannot match. For example, those who take part early in the Web3Bay presale have a unique chance to acquire tokens at a significantly lower price than their eventual final value. As the token price increases by 15% at each presale stage, early buyers experience substantial growth potential. Ownership and Influence in the Platform Web3Bay’s 3BAY tokens extend beyond mere transactional advantages. Token holders play a crucial role in governing the platform, as they can vote on key decisions and shape the direction of the marketplace. This participation ensures that Web3Bay evolves in ways that benefit its community, a stark contrast to Amazon gift cards, which provide no influence over the retailer’s strategies or offerings. Additionally, as Web3Bay transitions into a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), token holders will gain even greater control over the platform’s trajectory, solidifying their position as pivotal stakeholders in the Web3 revolution. Seize the Moment: Join the Web3Bay Presale Now Web3Bay’s presale is a prime opportunity to get 3BAY tokens at a ground-floor price.

With a vast total of 5 billion tokens, 40% of which are designated for the presale, early buyers can capture unmatched value. Unlike Amazon gift cards, which lose their practical value once used, 3BAY tokens represent a growing investment in the evolving e-commerce landscape. As Web3Bay expands, the value of these tokens is anticipated to rise, providing both immediate benefits and long-term growth potential.

The latest move makes El Salvador the sixth country to hold over 6,000 BTC. The country in Central America bought one Bitcoin on December 29, bringing the country’s total to 6000.77 Bitcoin, which translates to $569.3 million, as shown by the National Bitcoin Office of El Salvador’s portfolio tracker . After the purchase, the country’s Bitcoin investment rose to 108.02%. The Nayib Bukele portfolio tracker further indicates that El Salvador acquired the digital assets at an average purchase price of $45,450 per Bitcoin. The country made its first Bitcoin purchase on September 6, 2021, when it bought 200 Bitcoins. It officially became the first country to declare Bitcoin a legal tender by then. The latest purchase solidifies crypto’s status as a treasury asset for President Nayib Bukele’s country. El Salvador accelerates Bitcoin purchases despite IMF warnings El Salvador ranks sixth among the countries that hold Bitcoin. According to BitBo’s Bitcoin Treasuries data, it falls behind the United States, China, the United Kingdom, Ukraine, and Bhutan. Although the country always buys a Bitcoin per day, it bought $1 million worth one day after striking a $1.4 billion deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and again on December 22, despite the IMF requesting it row back some of its Bitcoin activity. The purchases are in line with El Salvador’s National Bitcoin Office Director Stacy Herbert’s statement on X on December 19, in which he indicated that the country would continue to buy Bitcoin at an accelerated pace. Bitcoin has led to financial freedom in the Central America’s country El Salvador is proud of the achievements associated with Bitcoin since it undertook the mission of stacking digital assets. It recently showcased those achievements in a meeting between Vice President Félix Ulloa Jr. and Zhang Yanhui, the Ambassador of the People’s Republic of China.

These groups argue that the IRS has exceeded its legal authority by categorizing DeFi platforms as brokers, sparking backlash across the crypto sector. The IRS recently expanded the definition of ""broker"" to include decentralized exchanges and front-end platforms, requiring them to report all crypto transactions and user details. These rules, set to take effect in 2027, aim to improve transparency in digital asset trading. However, critics argue that the agency’s interpretation goes beyond the scope of its statutory powers and violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) . The advocacy groups claim these regulations create excessive compliance burdens, particularly for software developers building DeFi trading interfaces. They warn this could stifle innovation and push emerging technologies offshore. Marisa Coppel, Head of Legal at the Blockchain Association, stated that the IRS’s move infringes on privacy rights and unfairly targets decentralized technologies. The broader crypto community has also voiced strong opposition. Bill Hughes, a lawyer at Consensys , criticized the timing of the rule's release during the holiday season, suggesting it was a tactic to minimize public resistance. Miles Jennings, General Counsel at a16z Crypto, called the regulation a heavy-handed approach designed to restrict DeFi growth. Additionally, Alexander Grieve, Vice President of Government Affairs at Paradigm, urged Congress to reconsider and potentially block the regulation. Lawmakers, including French Hill and Patrick McHenry, have expressed their disapproval, calling the rule an overstep by the Treasury. Hill described it as a poorly crafted policy finalized in the closing days of the current administration. The lawsuit underscores growing tension between regulators and the crypto industry, highlighting concerns about innovation, privacy, and the future of decentralized finance in the United States .",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-28 23:13:02

With both short-term and long-term projections for 2025, Altura is positioned as a standout project in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency and gaming industries. What is Altura? Altura is a blockchain-based platform that empowers game developers to create and manage in-game items as NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). Unlike traditional gaming assets that are locked within specific games, Altura enables true ownership, allowing players to trade, sell, and use their items across multiple games. This innovation creates a seamless and engaging gaming experience. What makes Altura stand out is its ease of use and efficiency. The platform is designed for developers and gamers alike, making it a preferred choice for integrating blockchain technology into gaming ecosystems. Why Altura is Bullish • Integrating AI: Altura uses artificial intelligence to predict gaming trends, enhance user interactions, and streamline the development process. This integration makes Altura’s platform smarter and more adaptable to the fast-paced gaming industry.• A Hundred-Billion-Dollar Industry: The global gaming market, along with AI, is worth hundreds of billions of dollars and is expected to grow into trillions. By targeting this industry with cutting-edge technology, Altura has positioned itself in one of the most lucrative markets.• NFT Adoption in Gaming: NFTs are becoming increasingly popular in gaming, offering players real ownership of their digital assets. Altura’s focus on gaming NFTs aligns perfectly with this trend, making it a preferred platform for developers and gamers.• Strategic Partnerships: Altura recently partnered with Immutable, integrating advanced tools like Immutable Passport and Checkout to enhance game development and player experiences. This collaboration highlights Altura’s commitment to innovation and growth in the Web3 gaming space.• Supporting Developers: Altura launched a $1 million Web3 Gaming Grant Fund to support game studios and developers. This fund allocates $50,000 each month, fostering creativity and innovation in blockchain gaming.• Potential Exchange Listings: Altura has significant potential to be listed on top-tier exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. With Binance’s 220+ million users and Coinbase’s 100+ million users, such listings could provide immense exposure and liquidity, further boosting Altura’s value. Short-Term Price Prediction for Altura ($ALU) Altura’s price chart shows a falling wedge pattern, a classic bullish signal. The immediate target is $0.20, but with the growing bullish sentiment around its technology and market positioning, the price could exceed $0.50 by Q1 2025. If the altcoin season kicks off in January 2025, Altura’s momentum could gain even more traction. This period often sees rapid market-wide growth, and Altura is well-positioned to capitalize on it. Market Cap and Long-Term Targets for 2025 Altura’s long-term potential is reflected in three clear projections: • Base Target: Altura’s price reaching a $1.5 billion market cap, approximately $1.52 per ALU, is the lowest expected target. This could happen even in a slow or unfavorable market. The project’s solid foundation and consistent innovation mean that Altura can grow despite challenging conditions.• Bullish Target: A $3 billion market cap, translating to about $3.03 per ALU, is highly realistic. This outcome is supported by the growing excitement around AI and gaming and favorable market trends. Altura’s focus on blockchain gaming and NFT adoption positions it perfectly to achieve this target, especially with a potential altcoin season driving momentum.• Ultimate Ambition Target: Altura could achieve a market cap between $5 billion and $10 billion, equating to $5.05 to $10.10 per ALU. This would likely occur during a cryptocurrency super cycle, where Ethereum surpasses $15,000 and Bitcoin trades above $240,000. Such market dynamics, combined with Altura’s positioning in the thriving AI and gaming sectors, could drive unprecedented growth for the project. Conclusion The Bullish Target of $3 billion market cap is very achievable due to the fact that we are still early in the cryptocurrency market. Many leading altcoins, such as Ethereum, are still trading below their previous all-time highs. This suggests that the altcoin season hasn’t even started yet. As a result, reaching a $3 billion market cap for Altura would be a realistic milestone, representing an impressive 3000% increase in value. Why Altura’s Future is Bright Altura stands at the intersection of three powerful trends: gaming, blockchain, and AI. The gaming industry’s rapid expansion, combined with Altura’s innovative use of NFTs and AI, positions it as a key player in this space. With increasing interest from developers, gamers, and investors, Altura is set to achieve remarkable milestones in the coming years. Final Thoughts Altura ($ALU) is a project with immense potential and real-world applications. Whether it’s through short-term growth driven by market patterns or long-term success fueled by its strategic focus, Altura is a cryptocurrency worth watching. With partnerships like Immutable and initiatives like the Web3 Gaming Grant Fund, Altura is setting itself up for success. As we approach 2025, keep an eye on this innovative project—it could be a game-changer in your portfolio. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Meanwhile, Stellar’s technical analysis shows a 29% decline this month, suggesting a continuing downward trend. In the midst of these developments, anticipation around BlockDAG (BDAG) grows following an AMA announcing its 2025 plans to launch on premier exchanges. This news has spiked BDAG demand, with its presale now exceeding $173 million. The journey toward a $600 million presale target appears more feasible, with analysts predicting a BDAG price of $1 by 2025. Let’s delve into how these digital currencies are positioning themselves as the best cryptos to buy now. Stellar’s Outlook: Prolonged Bearish Trends Ahead Stellar’s recent technical analysis indicates a significant 29% fall over the last month. The appearance of a ‘death cross’ could mean the bearish phase isn’t over yet, although a surge in buying might suggest an upcoming reversal. Currently, Stellar finds support at $0.31 and faces resistance at $0.40. The technical charts, including the Directional Movement Index (DMI), point to a strengthening bearish force with an ADX over 25, signaling a strong trend. However, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) index has risen to 0.19, reflecting notable purchasing activity. Should this buying momentum continue, Stellar could potentially breach its current constraints and ascend further. Chainlink’s Pricing Path: Poised for a $32 Breakthrough Despite recent hurdles, Chainlink holds firm support at $21, potentially setting the stage for a push toward the $32 resistance level. A significant amount of LINK has transitioned from exchanges to private storage, hinting at a decrease in sell-off pressure. If Chainlink maintains this foundational support, it may witness an upward trajectory. Growing optimism for Chainlink’s price is evident, with commentary from analyst @Bitcoin_Buddah on X suggesting, “Trump’s World Liberty is actively acquiring LINK, and IMO, Chainlink will spearhead the Altcoin movement in 2025.” Stability is crucial for Chainlink; a fall below support might lower its price further. BlockDAG’s 2025 Exchange Debut Unveiled in the Latest AMA BlockDAG recently stole the spotlight in its December 2024 AMA by announcing substantial development goals. The headline news is BlockDAG’s preparations for major listings in 2025. This AMA shared insights into ongoing discussions with several prominent exchanges, noting a more organized approach to onboarding than before. Aiming to launch on approximately 10 exchanges, this plan positions BlockDAG for swift international growth, boosting its global visibility and making it a top contender as the best crypto to buy now . The buzz from this news has significantly boosted demand for BDAG, prompting a rush for early participation. As the crypto presale surpasses $173 million with prices climbing, daily contributions of over $5 million from major participants indicate a $600 million presale target could soon be a reality. For those eyeing substantial gains, time is of the essence. BDAG’s price is presently $0.0234 in the quickly depleting presale batch 26, with a significant price increase anticipated for the upcoming batch. Adding to the excitement, analysts project that BDAG might reach $1 by the end of 2025. Early participants in BDAG have seen a 2240% ROI, and the projected $1 price points to a possible 4200% ROI for those in batch 26. In brief, entering now might lead to greater gains than delaying and facing higher costs later. The Bottom Line With the Chainlink price steady at $21 and the potential to rise to $32, it presents itself as a robust choice. Meanwhile, the Stellar (XLM) technical analysis after a recent decline suggests a potential upturn if buying intensifies, offering a cautious yet hopeful outlook for market watchers. BlockDAG sets itself apart with its bold plans for 2025 exchange listings. These planned listings are expected to increase global accessibility to BDAG, thereby ramping up demand. With the presale already beyond $173 million and a projected price of $1 by 2025, BlockDAG ranks as one of the best cryptos to buy now.

You’ve just heard of a quirky new token, Turbo (TURBO), hitting Coinbase and skyrocketing in value. You think about investing but hold back. Fast forward a few weeks, and it’s all over crypto news: early adopters are laughing their way to the bank. Now, you’re left wondering, “What if?” Here’s the kicker: history is offering you a redo with BTFD Coin (BTFD) —a presale sensation that’s already raised over $4.5 million and sold 59 billion coins to 6,700+ holders. With a limited festive discount rolling back prices to Stage 7, this could be your chance to make up for missing TURBO’s rocket ride. The question is, are you ready to seize this best new meme coin presale with 50% bonus coins? BTFD Coin: Buy the Festive Dip and Lead the Bulls! The BTFD Coin presale is not just another crypto sale—it’s a movement for those who believe in grabbing opportunities during market chaos. Aptly named after the infamous “ Buy the Dip ” mantra, this token is designed for fearless investors. Launched at $0.000004 per coin, the presale price is now rolled back to Stage 7 ($0.000013), offering an 837% potential ROI when listed at $0.0006 after the presale. But BTFD isn’t just about hype. The project flaunts impressive features, including: A P2E Game: Beta version live since Stage 10. Play, level up, and earn once rewards launch. 90% APY Staking: Staking rewards started on December 2, making it one of the juiciest options for long-term holders. Referral Program: Earn 10% of every referral and climb the leaderboard for exclusive rewards. Community-Driven Power: Led by the “Bulls Squad,” BTFD unites crypto enthusiasts for collective growth. Take this example: If you invest $10,000 at the current presale price ($0.000064), you’d bag 156,250,000 BTFD tokens. Once listed at $0.0006, your stash would be worth a jaw-dropping $93,750. That’s nearly 9x your investment! How to Join the BTFD Presale: Go to the BTFD Presale Page . Connect Your Wallet: Choose MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or another supported wallet. Apply the Code: Enter this “BIG50” code for a festive bonus. Enter Purchase Details: Decide how much BTFD you want. Confirm and Buy: Complete your transaction. With its current momentum, BTFD could dominate the 2025 meme coin space. Don’t wait—secure your dip before January 5, 2025. Turbo (TURBO): The Meme Coin That Got Away Launched as a bold experiment in 2023, Turbo (TURBO) started as a community-driven meme coin with no initial funding. Its meteoric rise was turbocharged when Coinbase listed it, sending the price soaring to $0.00997 at its peak. Despite slight retracements, TURBO still stands as one of the most promising meme coins of recent times. Here’s a quick recap of TURBO’s journey: Initial Hype: The community rallied behind TURBO’s underdog story, pushing its market cap into the hundreds of millions within months. Key Milestones: TURBO got a major boost with its Coinbase listing, increasing liquidity and visibility. Market Performance: Currently priced at ~$0.0089, TURBO remains a high-volatility asset that demands careful timing. Missed TURBO’s early days? You’re not alone. Many hesitated, thinking it was just another meme coin. But those who trusted the process reaped huge rewards, proving that early adoption is key in crypto. While TURBO still holds potential, the question remains: is it worth chasing an asset that’s already made its big leap? Why 2024’s Economic Lessons Make BTFD a Must-Buy If history teaches us anything, it’s that crises breed opportunities. The 1973–74 crash saw markets drop nearly 50%, but savvy investors like Warren Buffett thrived by buying undervalued assets. The same principle applies to meme coins like BTFD. Today, market dips aren’t signs of doom—they’re launchpads. BTFD’s Stage 7 rollback price is the ultimate dip-buying opportunity . Add in the 90% staking APY and P2E game rewards, and you’re looking at a project with both short-term gains and long-term potential. Conclusion: Don’t Let This Best New Meme Coin Presale Slip Away You might’ve missed Turbo’s early rally, but BTFD Coin is here to offer you a second chance at riding the meme coin wave. With its innovative features, strong community, and a presale discount that screams value, BTFD is poised to make headlines in 2025. Don’t sit this one out—head to the BTFD Presale Page , use the code “ BIG50, ” and secure your share before January 5, 2025. This isn’t just another meme coin. It’s a movement.

Trump Cyborg (TRUMPCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCYB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Cyborg launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Cyborg on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Cyborg by entering its contract address – 9yaNQ89EaQ2nEDczZpuTZfDwfiYCxbwSYC4JeiWLDE57 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCYB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-29 00:24:00

This development comes after a strong price surge, followed by a period of consolidation that mirrors the shape of a flag. Such patterns are typically interpreted as continuation signals, hinting that the recent upward momentum could resume if key conditions are met. Currently trading within this flag’s boundaries, XRP appears to be gathering strength for its next big move. A successful breakout would likely validate the bullish scenario, positioning the altcoin for significant gains and sparking renewed optimism in the market. Conversely, a breakdown below the lower boundary could undermine hopes, paving the way for a possible retracement. Analyzing The Bullish Flag: A Closer Look At XRP’s Pattern The bullish flag pattern is a reliable continuation signal in technical analysis, suggesting further upside potential. For XRP, this pattern has gained attention as it indicates the cryptocurrency may be preparing for its next upward move. Related Reading: XRP Price Takes a 5% Hit: Is More Downside Ahead? XRP’s price initially surges, creating a “flagpole” driven by strong positive momentum and high volume. Following this is a consolidation phase where the price moves within a narrow range, typically downward or sideways. This consolidation represents a temporary pause in the uptrend, allowing the market to digest gains. It demonstrates resilience, suggesting that selling pressure is manageable and the bullish trend could resume. Furthermore, the formation is validated when the price breaks out above the upper boundary of the flag, resuming its prior upward trajectory. Such a breakout would signal renewed buying interest and the potential to test higher price levels. Key indicators to watch include increased trading volume during the breakout as this confirms market participation and bullish conviction. Additionally, XRP must sustain its momentum above the resistance level to avoid the risk of a false breakout. Key Resistance And Support Levels: Navigating The Breakout Potential If XRP’s price breaks out above the upper boundary of the bullish flag pattern, it could signal the continuation of the uptrend and open the door for a move toward higher price levels, with the next major resistance zone near $2.90. A successful breakout above this level would reinforce the upside trend, possibly leading to new price highs. Related Reading: XRP Consolidation Could End Once It Clears $2.60 – Top Analyst Expects $4 Soon However, if XRP breaks below the lower boundary of the flag, the immediate support to watch is $1.90. A decisive break below this level could signal a shift in market sentiment, potentially leading to further downside movement. Such a breach would suggest that the bullish momentum has faltered, and the next support zone might be tested, which may trigger additional selling pressure.

Interestingly, an engineer believes that the biggest Bitcoin bull run is coming soon, considering the M2 marker. Understanding the Biggest Bitcoin Bull Run Phase In a recent tweet, a popular crypto analyst & engineer, Ted Boydston, presented an interesting BTC price analysis, predicting the upcoming Bitcoin bull run phase. According to Ted’s analysis , the price oscillator on the M2 has recently formed, which provides buy and sell signals. As the M2 money stock analyses the liquid cash circulation, including physical cash (M1), checking deposits, and other near money instruments like saving, money markets, etc, it is a key economic indicator that influences all the financial markets, including the crypto market. The engineer’s prediction also focuses on the same, as he talks about the Bitcoin price movements and the global liquidity trends. More importantly, the oscillator derived from the PPO of M2 sits at the lower panel. As a result, it flashed the buy signal and entered the green zone. More importantly, historical reports confirm that such signals often head to major money printing and Bitcoin’s manic phase. Eventually, this leads to the famous Bitcoin bull run. During this time, investors often witness increased price volatility and rapid price appreciation. Although this signal works pretty well, there was one exception in 2016. It failed to flash a signal back then, as the Bitcoin halving event primarily drove the BTC price rally. Interestingly, the investor’s expectations are still consistent to witness Bitcoin regaining support and surging past the current ATH of $108.2k. Expert Bitcoin Price Predictions & Forecasts Until recently, the biggest target for BTC price was $100k, but that has been achieved, so now the eyes are on what’s more coming. Many crypto analysts have claimed to see Bitcoin price at $150k or even $1M, but the most understandable one is that Bitcoin might reach $225k per Boydston’s analysis. Boydston talks about the manic phase bull market, wherein each BTC cycle, a top is formed at around 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level. If the same data is put in the current cycle, the BTC price target is $225K with the Bitcoin bull run. Another crypto analyst has come with a similar outlook and predicted that Bitcoin price could reach $225k in June 2025. More importantly, he also predicted a major altcoin season beginning after that. Such similar outlooks increased the probability of that happening for real. One other outlook focuses on Tether’s dominance, which is in a tough spot with its decreasing circulating supply with Europe’s Tether Ban. Final Thoughts Ted Boydston’s analysts’ Bitcoin price prediction has presented a new image of the possible bull market for this cryptocurrency. As the M2 has flashed a buy signal, this has hinted that Bitcoin’s manic phase will begin soon. Interestingly, another crypto analyst has added the timelines to that as the Bitcoin bull run could result in the BTC price hitting $225k in June 2025 before handing over the bulls to the altcoins. This might make hundreds of investors’ dreams come true. However, careful investment and strategic planning are a must, as many factors could hinder this path. More importantly, running the technical analysis and making smart decisions are the keys to returns, not the internet analysts’ prediction, as they vary from time to time and from person to person.

On Dec. 29, El Salvador acquired an additional 1 BTC, bringing its total holdings to 6,000.77 Bitcoin, valued at $569.3 million, according to the National Bitcoin Office’s portfolio tracker. This latest purchase reflects a gain of 108.02% on its Bitcoin investment, with an average acquisition price of $45,450 per BTC, as per the Nayib Bukele portfolio tracker. The country made its first Bitcoin purchase of 200 BTC on Sept. 6, 2021, coinciding with its historic decision to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. El Salvador Among Top Bitcoin-Holding Nations With 6,000.77 BTC, El Salvador ranks sixth in Bitcoin holdings among nation-states, following the United States, China, the United Kingdom, Ukraine, and Bhutan, according to BitBo’s Bitcoin Treasuries data. Although El Salvador typically acquires one Bitcoin daily, it made significant purchases on Dec. 22 and one day after striking a $1.4 billion agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This occurred despite the IMF urging the country to scale back its Bitcoin activities. Stacy Herbert, Director of El Salvador’s National Bitcoin Office, suggested in a Dec. 19 post on X that the country might accelerate its Bitcoin acquisitions. A Bitcoin Office spokesperson confirmed to Cointelegraph that El Salvador has no plans to sell its holdings, emphasizing that “Bitcoin continues to be our main strategy.” Chivo Wallet to Be Phased Out However, Herbert noted that El Salvador’s Chivo wallet will “be sold or wound down,” with private-sector Bitcoin wallets expected to take over the role. The IMF has yet to approve the $1.4 billion deal, which could conclude four years of negotiations complicated by Bukele’s Bitcoin policies, which the IMF has described as risky for the nation.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-29 00:32:46

Ali Martinez tells his 104,600 followers on the social media platform X that the Tom DeMark (TD) Sequential Indicator presented a bullish signal for DOGE. “The TD Sequential presents a buy signal on the Dogecoin DOGE four-hour chart, anticipating a price rebound!” Source: Ali Martinez/X Traders use the TD Sequential Indicator to predict potential trend reversals for tokens based on the closing prices of their 13 previous bars or candles. Martinez also notes that Dogecoin whales bought more than 90 million DOGE in the past two days. Source: Ali Martinez/X DOGE is trading at $0.314 at time of writing, a fractional decrease in the past 24 hours. Looking at Bitcoin ( BTC ), Martinez warns that traders should be worried if the top-ranked crypto asset by market cap drops below a certain price level. “You don’t want BTC to dip below $92,730 – it’s essentially free-fall territory if that level breaks.” Source: Ali Martinez/X Martinez suggests that below $92,730, the next on-chain support for BTC hovers at around $69,000 based on Glassnode’s UTXO ( Unspent Transaction Output ) Realized Price Distribution, a metric that shows the amount of Bitcoin that last moved within a specific price bucket. But while Martinez is sounding the alarm about a potential pullback for BTC, he notes that a 20-30% correction represents “the most bullish thing that could happen to Bitcoin.” Source: Ali Martinez/X Bitcoin is trading at $94,671 at time of writing.

While the Dogecoin price is exhibiting impressive growth prospects in this bull run, the meme coin faces limited upside, leaving Dogecoin whales to pursue massive returns on their investment elsewhere. Read on to see why ETFSwap (ETFS) is the perfect pick for Dogecoin-like gains towards 2025. Dogecoin Whales Are Targeting New Coins With Potential For Huge Profits Dogecoin whales are recognized as major market movers after hitting huge profits from early DOGE investments. Moreover, the Dogecoin price has impressed over the past few weeks, delivering decent gains to investors who caught the bullish trend early. However, experts believe the Dogecoin price provides limited upside due to its $50 billion market cap. As of this writing, the Dogecoin price is at $0.3343, having gained over 250% in the past year. Most Dogecoin holders at this stage of the market cycle are targeting a return to its $0.73 all-time high and potentially a surge to $1. Although Dogecoin whales have the size to make the most of this potential price surge, it makes sense to pursue other opportunities promising huge returns with a small investment. ETFSwap (ETFS) is in the price range that will make early investors millionaires at the peak of the bull run. Thus, the new DeFi token might set up early investors as the next generation of Dogecoin whales. ETFSwap (ETFS) Predicted For 45,000% Returns In Massive Breakout Pump ETFSwap (ETFS) is set for a rally that could deliver the biggest gains for the 2025 bull market. This new cheap DeFi token is attracting institutional and retail investors alike who see the prospects of its unique solution. At the same time, recent market trends show growing traction from Dogecoin whales as ETFSwap (ETFS) sees some heavy purchases. ETFSwap (ETFS) had a massive presale a few months back, and the Uniswap launch has featured major traction from investors capitalizing on its prospect for short and long-term gains. ETFSwap (ETFS) is a new platform that will deliver the ETF market on-chain , allowing investors to buy tokenized ETFs backed by actual securities from traditional markets. Also, the tokenized ETFs will feature assets from various industries , including healthcare, energy, engineering, and more. This gives users the option to easily diversify and convert between ETFs much easier than with centralized platforms. Additionally, ETFSwap (ETFS) will partner with regulated investment banks that trade both cryptocurrencies and securities. This enables cross-compatibility between ETFs and cryptocurrencies, creating a platform for easy crypto-to-ETF conversion. Furthermore, the new ETFSwap (ETFS) platform promises unique features , including faster ETF settlements, lower transaction costs, staking for passive rewards, and many more. Staking the native ETFS token will deliver up to 87% APR, and this cheap DeFi token is still incredibly cheap on Uniswap. As you consider adding the DeFi token to your portfolio, it’s pertinent to note that it’s listed on CoinMarketCap , and the ETFSwap (ETFS) team has passed a KYC audit by SolidProof . Conclusion Dogecoin whales are diversifying their DOGE holdings into ETFSwap (ETFS) to target huge market returns in the coming months. The new ETF platform is poised as the obvious option for investors looking to diversify into the ETF market. At the same time, its unique on-chain features will entice TradFi users to pursue more profits on the token. ETFSwap (ETFS) is a revolutionary project, and investing in the DeFi token while it’s still cheap on Uniswap could be highly profitable.

Homosexual Pepe (HOMOPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homosexual Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homosexual Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Homosexual Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homosexual Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homosexual Pepe by entering its contract address – 92xPeBxtanptFH9AYsRtwRMq7cWWw9GHfxaspwpNvCTP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-29 01:45:00

With the altcoin’s price now hovering around the $36 price zone, recent market predictions have highlighted a critical market condition needed to avoid a complete collapse of AVAX’s bullish structure. Related Reading: AVAX Price Inches Closer To $50 – Will Bulls Deliver A Breakout? AVAX Bulls Must Defend $35.30 For Total Price Recovery On December 27, digital asset analysis platform More Crypto Online shared an insightful commentary on the AVAX market via the X platform. With the aid of the Elliott Wave Theory, the market experts forecasted a yellow scenario which is typically a bullish projection. For context, the yellow scenario indicates an asset is in a corrective phase specifically within the B-wave of an A-B-C correction i.e a three-wave pattern that occurs during a price correction of which B is usually an upward movement that aligns with the ongoing market trend before transitioning to a final downward C-wave. A yellow scenario suggests the B-wave is still forming and could push higher, provided an asset’s price holds above certain levels. In terms of the AVAX market, analysts at More Crypto Online state the asset price must remain above $31.69 to keep the yellow scenario valid. However, to strengthen the case of this yellow scenario, market bulls must ensure AVAX’s price does not break below $35.3 as a dissent below this price region could potentiate a further decline to $31.69. The analyst warns that any price fall below this lower threshold would invalidate the yellow scenario resulting in a downward C-wave. Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) 25% Surge Fueled By New Initiatives To Support Developers AVAX Price Overview At the time of writing, AVAX trades at $36.74 following a decline of 2.12% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the altcoin’s daily trading volume is down by 6.40% and valued at $448.45 million. On larger time charts, AVAX is in greater losses of 11.65% in 7 days and 14.81% in 30 days, demonstrating a consistent decline in recent weeks. In making any headway, AVAX will first need to confront a major resistance at the $42 price zone, the subversion of which could open the pathway for a potential rally to $55. With the crypto bull run predicted to fully take off in early 2025, this altcoin remains an investor’s favorite following its price performance in the 2021 bull cycle during which it gained by over 4,400 to establish its current all-time high of $144.96. With a market cap of $14.92, AVAX continues to rank as the 11th largest asset in the cryptocurrency market.

Hedera Hashgraph is attracting institutional interest with its groundbreaking ETF filing, enhancing market liquidity. Meanwhile, Cardano has witnessed a remarkable 76% increase in value within a week, thanks to strategic alliances and significant activity from major investors. Yet, Web3Bay is reshaping the e-commerce sector by offering a fully decentralized platform that cuts out expensive middlemen. Its initial token offering starts at just $0.003 each, with projections showing a potential return of 6430%, highlighting it as a particularly promising investment. Web3Bay successfully combines blockchain’s capabilities with practical applications, making it the preferred option for progressive investors. Significant Advancements in Hedera Hashgraph Recently, Hedera Hashgraph has seen considerable developments, especially with Canary Capital filing for the first-ever HBAR ETF. This initiative is set to facilitate regulated access to Hedera’s tokens, potentially attracting more institutional investors and enhancing liquidity in the market. Following this development, the price of HBAR increased by nearly 20%, a reflection of the positive response from investors. Additionally, the inclusion of HBAR in Robinhood Markets’ crypto offerings has made it more accessible to traders in the U.S., further boosting its market presence. Cardano Experiences Strong Growth Cardano has shown impressive growth, with a 76% price increase noted last week. This surge is largely driven by significant buying from large-scale investors and is supported by the platform’s strategic partnerships and government projects. Although current technical indicators suggest Cardano might be overbought, potentially leading to short-term price adjustments, the continuous development and strategic efforts maintain its momentum and reinforce its position as a leading blockchain platform. Why Web3Bay’s Early Adopters Are Set for Phenomenal Growth Web3Bay is at the forefront of the e-commerce decentralization movement. Unlike traditional platforms that depend on banks and other financial intermediaries, Web3Bay eliminates these actors entirely. This blockchain-based marketplace allows users to conduct transactions directly, which significantly lowers costs and enhances both security and transparency. Moreover, Web3Bay’s 3BAY token is designed to support scalable network growth. It seamlessly integrates with major Layer-1 blockchains, ensuring that transaction processing remains fast and secure even as user activity increases. For those looking to invest early, Web3Bay’s presale offers an enticing entry point. The tokens are initially priced at just $0.003, with the price set to increase by 15% in each of the 28 stages, culminating at $0.1959 per token. This structured approach not only provides early backers with a potential ROI of 6430% but also positions them at the forefront of what could be a game-changing shift in e-commerce. Wrapping Up While Hedera and Cardano showcase the potential of blockchain for broader institutional acceptance and network expansion, Web3Bay is leading the way with actionable innovations. It transforms e-commerce by providing greater user control, transparency, and reduced fees. Its presale offers investors unmatched return prospects, highlighting its financial and technological promise.Investors looking to meld practical utility with significant returns will find Web3Bay to be the standout in a crowded market. Investing in Web3Bay now means more than just purchasing tokens; it’s about actively participating in the future of decentralized commerce.

Cardano (ADA) & Tron (TRX) Price Predictions Stay Positive,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdags-new-mystery-bonuses-begin-at-250-cardano-ada-tron-trx-price-predictions-stay-positive/,"As 2025 approaches, the crypto industry is growing, with notable projects advancing steadily. This week, the Cardano (ADA) price climbed to $0.937 despite less network activity, suggesting a guarded hope for its future performance. Simultaneously, the forecast for Tron remains positive, with TRX priced at $0.2573 and experts expecting a rise to $2 by 2030. On the other hand, in current presales, BlockDAG (BDAG) stands out as one of the best cryptos to buy now. Its BDAG400 bonus initially gives a 250% reward on the first purchase and offers more bonuses for subsequent buys. With a price projection of $1 by 2025, BlockDAG presents a unique chance for early participants to earn significant rewards. Cardano (ADA) Price Increases Despite Reduced Network Use This week saw the Cardano (ADA) price rebound sharply to $0.937, recovering impressively from recent lows. However, current statistics indicate possible hurdles ahead for the network. The transaction fees have fallen to a three-year low at 0.25 ADA on Wednesday, a drop from a peak of 0.615 ADA earlier in the year. This fee reduction, typically associated with lower network use, aligns with a notable decrease in daily active and new addresses, each down by over 35%. While the recovery in Cardano (ADA) price is encouraging, these indicators suggest a cautious outlook as overall network trends continue to evolve. Tron Price Prediction: Optimism for $0.5 by 2027 The outlook for Tron in the near term remains bullish, with TRX recently valued at $0.2573. Analysts predict continued growth, estimating a rise to $0.332 soon and targeting between $0.6718 and $0.8074 by 2027. By 2030, TRX is expected to exceed $2, indicating strong long-term growth prospects. Recent analyses show positive signals, such as a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 53.89, which points to solid market trust. Moreover, Tron’s recent partnership with Chainlink’s SCALE program, as revealed by founder Justin Sun last November, highlights its increasing practicality. These elements together strengthen the positive forecast for Tron’s price. BDAG Buyers Reap Big with BlockDAG’s Exclusive BDAG400 Bonus! BlockDAG introduces the BDAG400 bonus, presenting a great chance for early buyers to become part of this year’s biggest presale crypto . By applying the BDAG400 code during checkout, buyers gain a 250% bonus on their first purchase, effectively converting a purchase of 1,000 BDAG coins into 3,500 coins! The continuous purchases trigger even larger bonuses: a 270% bonus on the second buy, while the third, fourth, and fifth purchases contain bonus surprises in “mystery boxes.” This setup motivates continuous engagement, with each additional purchase unveiling further rewards. This bonus system includes a total of five rewards—two revealed initially and three as surprises—delivering substantial rewards for ongoing participants. However, this is a time-sensitive offer to acquire more of this exciting layer 1 coin through these bonuses.

While Bitcoin and Ethereum have long been the go-to choices for crypto enthusiasts, there’s a new player in town making some serious noise: Qubetics. As more investors search for alternative investment options to traditional assets, these digital assets are gaining traction. But what makes these coins different from each other? And why should you consider them now? Qubetics (TICS), Ethereum (ETH), and Kaspa (KAS) represent distinct aspects of the crypto ecosystem. Ethereum, the long-time giant of the smart contract world, has continued to thrive by fulfilling the demand for decentralised applications (dApps) and DeFi protocols. Kaspa, on the other hand, is quickly making a name for itself with its ultra-fast transaction speeds and scalability, appealing to investors looking for cutting-edge technology. And then there’s Qubetics, currently in its 13th presale stage, offering exciting potential and opportunities for early-stage investors who want to get in on the ground floor. Let’s break it down. Qubetics: The Fresh Gem with Unbeatable ROI Potential When looking for the best cryptos to invest in this weekend, Qubetics (TICS) should be on your radar. With its innovative AI-driven blockchain tools, Qubetics is poised to revolutionise how we think about blockchain development. The Qubetics presale is currently in its 13th stage, having raised over $8 million by selling more than 382 million $TICS tokens to over 12,200 holders. The $TICS token is priced at just $0.0342 in the 13th stage, but hold on – this price is set to surge by 10% come the weekend. The growth of Qubetics is undeniable, and the potential returns are jaw-dropping. Analysts predict that $TICS will be valued at $0.25 by the end of the presale, offering investors a staggering 630% return on investment (ROI). But it doesn’t stop there – once the presale wraps up and the project moves into its mainnet launch phase, the price of $TICS could skyrocket to as high as $5, offering an ROI of 14,503%. That’s enough to make even the most seasoned investors sit up and pay attention. Now, let’s talk about QubeQode Development Interface. This AI-powered IDE is a game-changer for blockchain development. Imagine being able to easily create and deploy smart contracts without having to be a coding expert. QubeQode simplifies the entire process, making blockchain accessible for businesses, professionals, and individuals alike. Whether you’re a developer looking for an intuitive platform to launch your next project or a business owner seeking to implement blockchain into your operations, QubeQode offers the perfect toolkit. For example, a small business wanting to incorporate blockchain into its supply chain can use QubeQode to develop smart contracts for automated payments and tracking. Or think about how developers building decentralized applications can drastically cut down development time with QubeQode’s easy-to-use interface. The possibilities are endless, and the demand for solutions like this is growing as businesses move towards adopting Web3 technologies. So, if you’re eyeing the best cryptos to invest in this weekend, Qubetics is a clear frontrunner with its revolutionary tools and impressive presale performance. Ethereum: The King of Smart Contracts Ethereum (ETH) has long held its position as one of the best cryptos to invest in this weekend, and for good reason. As the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum continues to be the backbone of decentralised applications (dApps) and the decentralised finance (DeFi) sector. Over the years, Ethereum has demonstrated its dominance in the market by consistently pushing the boundaries of blockchain technology and offering new, innovative solutions for investors and developers alike. The Ethereum network is most famous for its smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements that run on the blockchain without the need for intermediaries. This feature has made Ethereum the go-to platform for launching dApps, powering DeFi projects, and enabling the creation of NFTs. As of late 2024, Ethereum is also progressing with its shift to Ethereum 2.0, which promises to improve scalability, reduce energy consumption, and enhance network security. This upgrade could further cement Ethereum’s position as a dominant force in the crypto space. Ethereum’s position as a store of value and an investment vehicle has also been reinforced by its growing presence in institutional and retail markets. Investors have flocked to Ethereum not only for its technological advancements but also as a hedge against inflation and traditional market volatility. Ethereum’s flexibility, transparency, and security make it a reliable asset for diversifying an investment portfolio. If you’re looking for a strong and proven cryptocurrency that’s shown resilience over time, Ethereum continues to be one of the best cryptos to invest in this weekend. Kaspa: Speed, Scalability, and the Future of Blockchain If you’re searching for something fresh and innovative, Kaspa (KAS) is a name you need to know. Kaspa offers an entirely different take on blockchain technology, focusing on speed and scalability, which are two major challenges that traditional blockchains, including Ethereum, often struggle with. By using the DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) structure, Kaspa enables near-instant transaction finality and the ability to process tens of thousands of transactions per second. This makes Kaspa a highly attractive option for investors seeking fast, low-cost transactions in a decentralised network. The Kaspa network is gaining traction, especially as blockchain adoption increases, and it offers several advantages over legacy blockchain systems. Its ability to handle high throughput with minimal delays is particularly appealing for use cases in industries like financial services, gaming, and decentralized exchanges (DEXs), where speed is crucial. Additionally, the Kaspa team is committed to continuous development, with frequent network upgrades that enhance the overall user experience and scalability. While Kaspa’s market position is still emerging compared to Ethereum’s, the growth potential is massive. With its unique features and focus on solving the scalability issues that have plagued other blockchains, Kaspa is becoming an increasingly popular choice for those looking to diversify their cryptocurrency investments. For anyone who believes that speed and scalability will be the driving forces of the next generation of blockchain technologies, Kaspa is one of the best cryptos to invest in this weekend. Conclusion: The Future is Now – Take Action As the crypto market evolves, investors are presented with exciting opportunities, whether you’re looking for the stability of Ethereum, the speed of Kaspa, or the groundbreaking potential of Qubetics. These projects represent the future of finance and blockchain technology, each with its unique strengths and opportunities.

Solana and Ethereum have proven themselves as heavyweights in the blockchain space, and today, we’re going to explore why they’re still among the best cryptos to join now. But there’s a new contender on the block making waves – Qubetics (TICS) , which has already raised millions during its presale and is gearing up for a major launch. In this article, we’re going to dive into the strengths and market impact of Qubetics, Solana, and Ethereum, and why all of them represent exciting opportunities for crypto investors. Let’s start with Qubetics. This innovative platform is making a name for itself with a focus on blockchain development tools, including the game-changing QubeQode IDE. It’s still in its presale phase, but it’s already proven that its potential is massive. With over $8 million raised and more than 12,200 token holders, the $TICS token is poised for major gains as it approaches its final presale stages. Investors are already buzzing about its 630%+ potential ROI at presale’s end and a projected 14,500% ROI post-launch. Let’s take a closer look at Qubetics and why it’s one of the best cryptos to join now. Qubetics: The Future of Blockchain Development and Investment Qubetics is taking the blockchain world by storm, offering investors a unique opportunity to get in early on what many believe is a game-changing platform. Right now, the Qubetics presale is in its 13th stage, and it’s already raked in over $8 million, selling more than 382 million $TICS tokens to over 12,200 holders. The presale’s success is evident, with the token currently priced at $0.037, but it won’t stay there for long. The price is set to surge by 10% when the presale hits its next stage. For anyone looking for the best cryptos to join now , Qubetics represents a golden opportunity to secure massive returns before the price skyrockets. Analysts are buzzing about Qubetics’ potential for insane ROI. Some predict $TICS could hit $0.25 by the end of the presale, offering investors an eye-watering 630% return. Post-presale, experts are suggesting even bigger price leaps, with the $TICS token potentially hitting $1 (2820% ROI) or even $5 (14,503% ROI). And that’s not all. If $TICS continues its upward momentum after the mainnet launch, it could reach $15, offering a jaw-dropping 43,711% return on investment. But Qubetics isn’t just about incredible ROI. The platform’s cutting-edge technology is designed to address some of the major pain points in blockchain development, and this is where Qubetics truly shines. The QubeQode Development Interface is set to revolutionize the way developers, businesses, and professionals create smart contracts and dApps. Imagine being able to build complex blockchain applications without needing to be a coding expert. With QubeQode, that’s now possible. For businesses, QubeQode streamlines the entire blockchain development process . Whether you’re a startup or a well-established company, creating and deploying blockchain solutions can be costly and time-consuming.

Whether you’re an individual developer or part of a larger enterprise, Qubetics offers the tools you need to bring your blockchain vision to life. And with the $TICS token holding so much potential, now is the time to invest before the price inevitably rises. Solana: A High-Speed Blockchain with a Track Record of Success Solana has proven itself as one of the most reliable and efficient blockchain platforms in the crypto space. Known for its high-speed transactions and scalability, Solana has positioned itself as a top choice for developers and investors alike. Over the years, Solana has made a name for itself as one of the best cryptos to join now, thanks to its strong performance and growing adoption. What makes Solana stand out is its ability to handle thousands of transactions per second without compromising on security or decentralisation. With its innovative Proof-of-History (PoH) consensus mechanism, Solana has become one of the fastest blockchains on the market, processing over 65,000 transactions per second at its peak. This level of scalability is what has attracted both developers and institutional investors, who are keen on using Solana’s infrastructure to build decentralised applications (dApps) and facilitate high-frequency transactions. Solana’s impressive performance over the years has made it a strong alternative to Ethereum, which is known for its slower transaction speeds and higher fees. Solana has been able to attract major projects, including DeFi platforms, NFT marketplaces, and even large financial institutions. With its low transaction fees and speed, Solana has become a favourite among those looking for a blockchain that can handle high throughput without breaking the bank. For investors, Solana represents a unique opportunity. Its market position as a leading blockchain for decentralized finance (DeFi) and other dApp-based services has made it one of the most sought-after projects in the space. Analysts are optimistic about Solana’s future, with predictions suggesting that the token could see significant growth in the coming years. With its current price hovering around $218, many are confident that Solana will continue to play a central role in the blockchain ecosystem, making it one of the best cryptos to join now for long-term growth. Ethereum: The King of Smart Contracts and Decentralised Applications Ethereum remains one of the most well-known and established blockchain platforms in the world. It has cemented its position as the go-to platform for decentralised applications (dApps) and smart contracts, with thousands of developers building on its network. Ethereum has been a key driver of blockchain adoption, and it continues to be one of the best cryptos to join now due to its ongoing developments and major upgrades. Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) with Ethereum 2.0 was a pivotal moment in its history. The upgrade aims to make the network more scalable, secure, and energy-efficient, addressing some of the issues that have plagued Ethereum in the past. With the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, the network is now able to process more transactions per second while reducing its environmental impact. This has made Ethereum even more attractive to developers and investors who are looking for a blockchain that can support large-scale applications while also being more sustainable. Over the years, Ethereum has become synonymous with smart contracts and DeFi. It has served as the foundation for countless dApps, from NFT platforms to decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Ethereum has also become the leading platform for issuing new tokens, with the ERC-20 standard allowing developers to create their digital assets with ease. This has led to a massive influx of projects built on Ethereum, contributing to its strong market position. For investors, Ethereum represents a solid bet in the world of blockchain technology. With the ongoing developments in the Ethereum ecosystem, many analysts predict that Ethereum’s price could continue to rise, making it a strong contender for anyone looking for the best cryptos to join now.

Ju explained that store-of-value assets like gold and Bitcoin tend to rise in price when investors feel US economic dominance is under threat. However, he noted that confidence in the US economy and the dollar remains strong, with many investors continuing to view the dollar as a safe haven currency. This perception of strength, Ju argued, makes it unlikely that the Trump administration would adopt a Bitcoin strategic reserve. Instead, Trump may prioritize policies that reinforce the dominance of the US dollar. Ju stated: “Even before his inauguration, Trump consistently warned other world leaders of the power gap between the US and other nations. This rhetoric, combined with increased capital inflows to the dollar, could renew confidence in its supremacy.” He added, “Around me, many Koreans are choosing US dollars as a safe haven over gold or Bitcoin, particularly as the Korean won weakens.” This trend is mirrored in emerging economies, where individuals increasingly use US dollar stablecoins to store value. Stablecoins Boost US Dollar Dominance Paxos CEO Charles Cascarilla recently told Cointelegraph at the Bitcoin MENA conference that stablecoins will be central to the blockchain economy. According to him, dollar-pegged stablecoins enhance the utility of the dollar by combining fiat currency stability with the speed and global reach of blockchain technology. In countries like Turkey, where inflation hit 67% in March 2024, stablecoins have become vital. Turkey leads the world in stablecoin purchases as a percentage of GDP. Similarly, a 2023 Chainalysis report revealed that over 50% of digital assets sent to countries like Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico were stablecoins.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-29 03:03:00

Prince Elon (ELONPRIN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONPRIN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Prince Elon can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Prince Elon could become the next viral memecoin. Prince Elon launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Prince Elon on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Prince Elon by entering its contract address – 7rAsmWGTtPFY9RFnhd9biard7PrWtw5ZigowwfmaXUQ – in the receiving field.

The stories of people who turned a few hundred dollars into life-changing wealth haunt every crypto enthusiast who joined too late. One such recent example is Turbo (TURBO), a meme coin that started as a joke but ended up delivering staggering returns. If you missed the Turbo train, don’t worry. History is offering a second chance in the form of BTFD Coin’s top crypto presale . Meme coins have carved out a niche in the crypto world, delivering massive gains to savvy investors who get in early. Now, BTFD Coin is set to redefine this trend with its unique offerings: a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, a 90% staking APY, and an innovative referral programme. Add to this its festive price rollback to Stage 7 rates, and it’s clear that BTFD Coin is a chance no investor should ignore. BTFD Coin: Your Chance to Seize the Dip For those unfamiliar, BTFD represents “ Buy The Dip ,” a rallying cry for crypto enthusiasts looking to profit from market downturns. BTFD Coin’s presale began at $0.000004 per token and has already scampered to Stage 13, priced at $0.000014—an 837.5% ROI for early adopters. But here’s the kicker: for a limited time, investors can grab BTFD tokens with a 50% bonus by using the code BIG50. Features Setting BTFD Apart: Play-to-Earn Game: The beta version of BTFD’s P2E game went live in Stage 10, allowing users to engage with the ecosystem while preparing for future rewards. 90% APY on Staking: Staking went live on December 2, offering investors a secure way to grow their holdings. Referral Programme: Earn 10% of raised funds in BTFD tokens by promoting the presale, with additional rewards for leaderboard positions. Bulls Squad Community: A vibrant community fostering collaboration and market insights. Imagine this: investing $5,000 in Stage 12 at $0.000013 per coin would yield approximately 78.125 million tokens. When BTFD lists at $0.0006 post-presale, your $5,000 could balloon to $46,875—an ROI of nearly 837.5%. BTFD’s unique roadmap ensures sustained interest and utility. Its tokenomics, including locked liquidity and community rewards, provide stability while incentivising long-term holding. With over $4.6 million raised and 60 billion coins sold, this is shaping up to be one of the year’s hottest presales . Turbo (TURBO): The Meme Coin You Missed Turbo, a meme coin launched in 2024, has captivated investors with its quirky branding and rapid adoption. Initially priced at fractions of a cent, Turbo soared to $0.00997 following its Coinbase listing. Investors who spotted the opportunity early walked away with massive gains, while latecomers were left wishing they had acted sooner. Turbo’s rise is a testament to the power of community-driven projects. Its unique marketing campaigns and high-profile exchange listings propelled it to meme coin stardom. However, like many meme coins, Turbo remains highly volatile. After reaching its peak, its value dipped to $0.0089, reflecting the speculative nature of the market. For those who missed out on Turbo’s early stages, the regret is palpable. But there’s no need to dwell on the past. The lessons learned from Turbo’s success can be applied to BTFD Coin, which is currently in its presale phase and poised for a significant post-launch rally. Why BTFD Stands Out While Turbo dazzled with its rapid price appreciation, BTFD offers a more robust value proposition. Turbo’s appeal was primarily driven by hype and community support, whereas BTFD combines meme coin charm with tangible utility. BTFD’s P2E game and high APY staking programme provide real-world benefits, making it more than just a speculative asset. Moreover, the ongoing presale allows investors to enter at a discounted price, maximising potential returns. Analysts predict BTFD’s listing price of $0.0006 could deliver exponential gains, making it a compelling alternative for those who missed Turbo’s meteoric rise. Join the BTFD Presale Before It’s Too Late! Seizing this opportunity is as simple as following these steps: Visit the BTFD Coin Presale Page . Connect your wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet). Put the bonus code BIG50 . Specify the amount of BTFD you wish to purchase. Confirm the transaction and secure your bonus tokens. With the presale ending soon, there’s no time to waste. Early investors have already reaped significant rewards, and the next wave of gains could be yours. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Your Second Chance If you’ve ever regretted not investing in a promising project like Turbo during its early stages, consider this your wake-up call. BTFD Coin’s top crypto presale is a golden opportunity to secure tokens at a discounted price and ride the wave of its post-launch success. With its P2E game, staking rewards, and community-driven growth, BTFD Coin is more than a meme—it’s a movement. Act now to claim your share of the future. Use the code BIG50 to get the bonus and seize the dip before it’s too late. The bulls are charging, and you don’t want to be left in the dust.

A crypto analyst has identified a new Cup and Handle pattern, suggesting that the top meme coin is likely headed for more pain, with a potential crash below $0.2. Chart Pattern To Trigger Dogecoin Price Crash A TradingView analyst known as ‘Cryptechcapital’ has shared a chart representing an Elliott Wave analysis of Dogecoin’s price movements on a long-term weekly time frame. While the analyst has provided a detailed report on Dogecoin’s present Elliott Wave structure, he has identified the formation of a textbook Cup and Handle pattern. Related Reading: Historical Data Shows What To Expect From Ethereum Price In Q1 2025 – It’s Very Bullish A Cup and Handle pattern is a technical indicator that signals a period of consolidation before a breakout. While it is typically considered a bullish signal that extends an uptrend, the crypto analyst has noted that its appearance in Dogecoin‘s chart points to a significant price correction to new lows. The analyst’s Dogecoin price chart outlines a 5-wave impulse structure from 1 to 5. Dogecoin is currently at Wave 4, a correction wave, where prices retrace and move sideways for a prolonged period. The handle of the Cup and Handle pattern also corresponds with Wave 4 of Dogecoin’s 5-wave structure. In the immediate term, the TradingVolume analyst has predicted a significant Dogecoin price crash once it completes Wave 4. He suggested that if the Cup and Handle pattern holds, Dogecoin may experience downward pressure over the next week. The analyst also added that the broader cryptocurrency market might face similar bearish headwinds, particularly with the rising market volatility and Bitcoin’s declining price. While the exact levels of the analyst’s projected decline are not specified, Wave 4 corrections are usually known to retrace significant portions of the previous Wave 3 gains. This means that if Dogecoin experiences a price decline during Wave 4, a potential dip below $0.2 could be possible. Dogecoin Crash First, Recovery Next? While Cryptechcapital has predicted a significant price crash for Dogecoin, he also asserts that this anticipated correction could pave the way for a powerful rebound. The TradingView analyst revealed that after the completion of Wave 4, Dogecoin is expected to enter Wave 5, signaling the end of its bearish phase and the beginning of a potential price rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Retests Support Line After Crash Below $95,000, Here’s The Next Target As mentioned above, the Cup and Handle pattern often signals the final consolidation phase before a price breakout. The TradingView analyst has predicted that Dogecoin could undergo a severe price crash before triggering a price recovery to the coveted $1 mark. The analyst’s price chart also highlights that if Dogecoin achieves a local high instead of continuing its projected correction, the Cup and Handle pattern will be invalidated. This development would require a new forecast for Dogecoin’s price trajectory.

The opportunity became especially apparent after Tether’s decision to discontinue its EURt stablecoin. For years, Tether Holdings has led the charge of stablecoins reshaping the global finance space. However, as traditional finance increasingly opens up to the crypto space, banks are also making the move to test the stablecoin issuance waters. Bloomberg reported that these banks will be looking to fill the chasm created as Tether Holdings discontinues its EURt stablecoin. Tether launched the EURt stablecoin in 2016. However, unlike the firm’s leading product USDT, the EURt failed to meet expectations and struggled to gain traction after its launch. Its market capitalization declined to an almost irrelevant figure of $37M compared to USDT’s market cap of over $138B. Tether Holdings announced in November that it will discontinue the EURt stablecoin in accordance with the new Market in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations in Europe. All aboard the stablecoin train Tether’s $10B in net profits has proven to be a major incentive for traditional banks, who are wasting no time in making their moves. Societe Generale-Forge (SG-Forge) has already launched a Euro-backed stablecoin ( EURCV ) and opened the product to retail investors. Oddo BHF , BBVA , and Revolut are exploring releasing their versions of euro-denominated stablecoins. AllUnity also plans to issue another euro-based stablecoin next year. MiCA has provided a clear regulatory framework for stablecoins and crypto assets in the EU, making it easy for companies and banks to issue their stablecoins. This clarity also created an allowance for competition in the stablecoin market, especially as Tether continues to drag its feet with meeting all the standards of the new European regulation. Jean-Marc Stenger, CEO of SG-FORGE, confirmed that multiple banks are in discussions to use its stablecoin technology either through partnerships or white-label deals. Banks in the US are lagging behind as there is no legislation in place that allows for the issuance of stablecoins. They are however expected to swarm the market once the legislation is passed. The global surge of stablecoins Traditional banks aren’t the only companies riding the stablecoin wave. Visa launched a tokenization network to ease the issuance of stablecoins. BBVA is among the banks piloting Visa’s technology, and it’s in discussions with many other banks as well. Cuy Sheffield, the head of crypto at Visa, confirmed in an interview with Bloomberg that they have received offers from banks in Singapore, Brazil and Hong Kong. “We are actively engaged with a number of banks across the world at various stages of the process,” he said. Standard Chartered partnered with Animoca Brands Ltd. and Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd., and was selected as one of the first issuers of HKD-denominated stablecoins in an experimental program. JPMorgan Chase has been exploring deposit tokens which are similar to stablecoins but are tied to bank accounts. The deposit tokens have limitations that can be offset by the use of stablecoins, allowing banks to leverage blockchain technology to overcome some of the inherent challenges in traditional banking systems. However, the use of stablecoins comes with its own set of challenges for banks. A European Central Bank analysis showed that converting retail deposits into stablecoin reserves could weaken liquidity coverage ratios, compromising banks’ ability to meet short-term obligations during turbulent periods. US regulators would also need to clarify what counts as acceptable reserves and whether stablecoin deposits will be insured to avoid user panic. The rise of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) is also an issue as it threatens bank-issued stablecoins for wholesale payments and other use cases. Even with these hurdles, Tether is sitting on a $10B gold mine, and banks seem to believe the stablecoin headache is a problem worth having.

The climate of the broad market has been sluggish in the festive period, with the two largest assets Bitcoin and Ethereum struggling to make a mark. With the Toncoin price now approaching the $6 mark, it appears that the altcoin is now fully in its recovery phase. According to a pseudonymous analyst, a recent on-chain phenomenon suggests that the price rally for TON is only just beginning. What Happened Last Time TON Staking TVL Ratio Was At A Low Level? In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, an analyst with the pseudonym Joaowedson discussed the dynamics between the staking TVL ratio and Toncoin price. According to the analyst, there is a correlation between the amount locked on TON and price movements. Related Reading: Historical Data Shows What To Expect From Ethereum Price In Q1 2025 – It’s Very Bullish The Quicktake analyst highlighted a trend whereby investors withdraw their assets in order to explore trading opportunities whenever there is a price increase. This phenomenon has also been observed in the TON ecosystem, with the TVL metric dropping in recent weeks. Joaowedson noted that the staking TVL ratio has reached new lows, coinciding with what appears to be a bottom for the price of Toncoin. Ultimately, this suggests that the odds of an increase in the Toncoin price are higher. While the idea of reduced interest in staking leading to price growth seems counterintuitive, it can be justified by the increase in liquidity available for trading. The Quicktake analyst explained: When investors withdraw funds from staking, they often transfer them to exchanges for quick trades. This movement increases demand for the token, driving prices higher. From a historical perspective, a similar situation occurred in March 2024 when the staking TVL ratio shrunk significantly as the TON price soared to new highs. “Interestingly, as interest in staking diminished, funds started migrating to centralized exchanges (CEX) and decentralized exchanges (DEX) like Ston.FI and Dedust, boosting the TVL in those categories,” Joaowedson added. With investors more willing to make their assets available for trading, there is a higher likelihood of price increases due to growing demand.

From playful tokens to serious players, these coins are dominating conversations. With the rise of innovative features and creative communities, meme coins are no longer just a joke; they’re now serious contenders in the investment game. For anyone looking to ride the wave of crypto hype, meme coins are worth a look. But how do you choose the best meme coins for exponential returns in a market so crowded? Enter BTFD Coin (BTFD), a trailblazer in the meme coin ecosystem that’s redefining the genre. With its electrifying presale, innovative staking rewards, and a Play-to-Earn game that’s turning heads, BTFD is creating excitement like never before. Moreover, with its BIG50 code offering 50% extra $BTFD coins, it’s the meme coin to watch. But BTFD isn’t alone in this space. Let’s dive into the five hottest meme coins that are grabbing headlines and could make you rethink your investment strategy. 1. BTFD Coin (BTFD): Redefining the Meme Coin Revolution When it comes to meme coins that pack a punch, BTFD Coin is leading the charge. With its presale breaking records and a community that’s rallying around its bold vision, BTFD Coin is one of the best meme coins for exponential returns this year. Let’s break it down. BTFD Coin is more than just a catchy acronym. It stands for “Buy The Dip,” a rallying cry for crypto enthusiasts who know the value of seizing opportunities during market downturns. Its presale launched at a humble $0.000004 per coin, but it’s now in Stage 13 at $0.00013, with over $4.6 million raised and more than 60 billion coins sold to over 7,000 holders. And with a listing price set at $0.0006, there’s massive potential for growth. One of BTFD’s standout features is its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, which made its beta version live during Stage 10 of the presale. While the beta version doesn’t offer rewards yet, it’s a sneak peek at what’s to come. The game, combined with a robust 90% APY staking programme and an exclusive Referral Programme, has created a buzz that’s hard to ignore. Let’s not forget the Bulls Squad, a dedicated community driving engagement and spreading the word about this powerhouse coin. Why did this coin make it to this list? BTFD Coin’s presale success, unique features, and the promise of exponential returns put it at the top of the list. If you’re looking to jump in, visit the presale page, connect your wallet, enter the bonus code BIG50, and grab 50% extra $BTFD coins before the deal expires on January 5th. 2. Book of Meme (BOME): The Literary Wonder of Meme Coins In a sea of meme coins, Book of Meme (BOME) stands out with its narrative-driven approach. Instead of just riding trends, BOME has built an entire ecosystem around storytelling, blending humour with community-driven lore. It’s a unique twist that’s resonating with a growing fanbase. BOME has launched a series of collectible NFTs tied to chapters of its fictional universe. These aren’t just digital trinkets; they’re integral to the coin’s ecosystem, offering holders perks like staking bonuses and early access to exclusive content. The team behind BOME is also rolling out an educational campaign, teaching newcomers about crypto through bite-sized memes. Think of it as a crash course in decentralised finance with a side of laughter. BOME’s value proposition lies in its strong focus on community. By fostering a sense of belonging through storytelling and interactive content, it’s creating a sticky user base. Investors aren’t just buying tokens; they’re becoming part of a larger narrative, which is why BOME’s popularity is skyrocketing. Why did this coin make it to this list? Book of Meme offers a unique blend of creativity and functionality, making it more than just another meme coin. It’s capturing imaginations while offering real-world utility, a rare combo that promises exponential returns. 3. Shiba Inu (SHIB): The OG That Keeps Surprising No list of the best meme coins for exponential returns is complete without Shiba Inu. It’s the granddaddy of modern meme coins, having carved out a niche that few others can match. What started as a joke has become a robust ecosystem, complete with its own decentralised exchange (ShibaSwap), an NFT collection, and even plans for a metaverse. Shiba Inu’s strength lies in its ability to pivot and adapt. While its early days were all about riding the Dogecoin hype, it’s now focusing on creating value for its holders. ShibaSwap, for example, allows users to stake their SHIB tokens, earn rewards, and participate in governance. The recent launch of Shibarium, a Layer 2 blockchain, aims to reduce transaction fees and improve scalability—key factors for long-term growth. The SHIB Army, as its community is affectionately called, plays a huge role in its success. This is a group of die-hard fans who’ve taken it upon themselves to promote, educate, and build on Shiba Inu’s ecosystem. Their commitment is a testament to the power of community in crypto. Why did this coin make it to this list? Shiba Inu’s proven track record, innovative projects, and dedicated community make it a no-brainer for anyone seeking exponential returns in the meme coin market. 4. Neiro (NEIRO): The Futuristic Meme Coin Neiro is shaking things up with its AI-driven features. It’s the first meme coin to integrate artificial intelligence into its core operations, promising a future where meme coins aren’t just for laughs but also for smart investments. At its heart, Neiro uses AI algorithms to predict market trends and provide holders with actionable insights. This isn’t just pie-in-the-sky tech; early adopters have reported significant gains by leveraging these insights. Neiro is also exploring partnerships with blockchain gaming companies, aiming to create an ecosystem where its token is the default currency for in-game transactions. What’s particularly exciting about Neiro is its focus on sustainability. Unlike many meme coins that rely on hype, Neiro is building a foundation for long-term growth. Its developers are transparent, its roadmap is ambitious but realistic, and its community is growing organically—no bots, just real people. Why did this coin make it to this list? Neiro’s innovative use of AI, focus on sustainability, and potential for exponential returns make it a standout in the meme coin universe. 5. Bonk (BONK): Solana’s Meme Coin Darling Bonk is Solana’s answer to Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. It’s the first meme coin on the Solana blockchain, and it’s making waves with its lightning-fast transactions and ultra-low fees. If you’ve ever been frustrated by Ethereum’s high gas fees, Bonk might just be your ticket to meme coin heaven. What sets Bonk apart is its community-first approach. The coin was airdropped to thousands of Solana users, creating an instant buzz and a broad holder base. This strategy has not only increased its adoption but also strengthened its community. Bonk’s developers are also committed to building tools and resources for creators, adding utility to what’s traditionally been a hype-driven market. Bonk’s roadmap includes plans for decentralised applications (dApps) and a unique staking mechanism that rewards long-term holders. While it’s still early days, the coin’s performance so far suggests it’s got staying power. Why did this coin make it to this list? Bonk’s innovative use of the Solana blockchain, combined with its community-first ethos, makes it a strong contender for exponential returns in 2024 and beyond. Why Buying the Dip Matters If history has taught us anything, it’s that economic downturns are ripe with opportunities. Take 1973, for instance. The global economy took a massive hit, yet those who invested wisely during the crash came out on top. The same logic applies today. In a market that’s anything but stable, buying the dip—or investing during bearish trends—can set you up for monumental gains. That’s where BTFD Coin comes in. Designed for those who see opportunity in chaos, it’s the perfect meme coin for these turbulent times. With its presale blazing past expectations and features like high-yield staking, P2E gaming, and an engaging Referral Programme, BTFD is built for investors who know the value of acting now. Conclusion The meme coin universe is buzzing with energy, creativity, and innovation, making it an irresistible space for crypto enthusiasts seeking exponential returns. Whether it’s BTFD Coin redefining presales with its insane features, Book of Meme pushing decentralisation boundaries, Shiba Inu proving the staying power of community-driven projects, Neiro tapping into AI-powered potential, or Bonk keeping Solana alive and kicking with fun, these coins showcase the best of what’s possible in the meme coin ecosystem.

While both HBAR and LINK prices are set to benefit greatly, the new AI-driven GambleFi protocol Rollblock (RBLK) is predicted to beat the two altcoins effortlessly. Let’s dig into why analysts tout RBLK as the best crypto investment of 2025 that could deliver staggering yields north of 50x. Rollblock (RBLK) is set to disrupt online casino markets with AI This Ethereum-based gambling protocol is turning the massive gambling empire on its head with a blockchain-powered, AI-driven GambleFi ecosystem. The iGaming juggernaut employs AI technology to support advanced betting strategies and copy-betting player initiatives, giving more competitive odds to players than other casino platforms. Furthermore, all gaming activity is posted on-chain, offering full transparency to players’ bets and transactions. Thus, no one can alter bets, injecting credibility into the infamous gambling industry. Things get even more alluring on the investment side. The iGaming platform pays weekly dividends to investors from a share of its profits, with RBLK token holders staking their coins earning up to 30% APY! Disrupting even a tiny share of the $540 billion casino market will be sufficient to make Rollblock a multibillion iGaming protocol on Ethereum, pushing the RBLK market cap to billions. That will spark a parabolic price action for the RBLK token, with analysts predicting it could surge 880% in presale and potentially blast past 50x on the launch! Hedera price up over 100% monthly Hedera price (HBAR) is on the fly. HBAR was up 106% month-to-date, pushing its yearly gains past 221%. That spectacular performance comes amid Hedera’s partnership with tech giant Nvidia and blockchain oracle Chainklink to power the development of enterprise AI applications and ensure secure data feeds and tokenization of real-world assets. These new developments are expected to enhance the platform’s appeal for developers and institutions, driving broader adoption of the Hedera network. As of press time, HBAR was trading with a slight pullback in the $0.28 zone. CoinCodex data shows it might surge over 196% to hit $0.86 by August 2025, making HBAR an attractive crypto investment . Chainlink (LINK) could surpass its ATH in 2025 Chainlink is the largest data oracle that feeds secure and reliable data to DeFi applications running smart contracts. Its recent partnership with Hedera underscores its vital role within the blockchain ecosystem, positioning LINK as a top crypto investment for value-oriented investors. In its recent upshot, LINK hit $30 before pulling back in the past weeks to hover in the $23 zone. At the current price, LINK was only up 29% monthly, bringing its year-to-date returns to 52%. Given its solid fundamentals, analysts believe LINK could be undervalued, and the altcoin is expected to push upward in 2025. LINK ‘s community sentiment was 89% bullish, and CoinCodex data reveals it could hit $85 by May 2025, pulling a 260% yield. Which is the best crypto investment: HBAR, LINK, or RBLK? HBAR and LINK are already established crypto assets and their large market caps limit their upside potential. However, RBLK is a new crypto gem that analysts believe is greatly undervalued at the $0.044 price, and analysts believe it’s one of the best crypto investment s.

This bullish outlook for the flagship crypto came as crypto analyst Tony Severino revealed a potential Doji formation, which suggested that BTC could enjoy this uptrend in the new year. Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘Head and Shoulders’ Setup Raises Fears Of $80,000 Price Drop – Details Doji Formation Could Lead To New Year Bitcoin Price Rally In an X post, Severino suggested that a Doji formation could lead to a Bitcoin price rally in the first two months of the new year. The analyst mentioned that he suspects BTC will end December with the Doji and then January shows a strong continuation for the flagship crypto. His accompanying chart showed that this strong continuation could extend into February. The crypto analyst explained that a Doji represents a pause in the market due to indecision from buyers and sellers. He added that the following candlestick shows market participants the decision the market has made through strong continuation or a reversal. In this case, Severino expects that the following candlestick will show a strong continuation for the Bitcoin price. Severino noted that a similar Doji at similar subwaves each resulted in two more months of upside before a local top was in for the Bitcoin price. Therefore, the crypto could enjoy two months of upside between January and February 2025 if history repeats itself. From a fundamental perspective, Donald Trump’s inauguration is one factor that could spark this strong continuation. The BTC price rallied above $100,000 after Trump’s victory in the November US presidential elections. As such, the flagship crypto could continue this rally as Trump becomes the first pro-crypto US president. Moreover, the US president-elect may create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve when he takes office, which would provide more bullish momentum for BTC. BTC Needs To Hold Above $92,730 In an X post, crypto analyst Ali Martinez remarked that the Bitcoin price needs to avoid dipping below $92,730, as if that level breaks, it will be in free-fall territory. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that Bitcoin could drop to the $70,000 range if it breaks this $92,730 price level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Surge: Are Traders Preparing For A Major Market Shift? However, in another X post, Martinez suggested that such a Bitcoin price drop might not necessarily be bad. This came as he stated that a 20% to 30% price correction is the most bullish thing that could happen to Bitcoin. Meanwhile, Martinez stated that the invalidation levels for his bearish Bitcoin outlook are a sustained close above $97,300 and a daily close above $100,000. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $94,400, down almost 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Despite soaring market optimism in light of investors expecting a bullish Q4, top cryptocurrency prices have encountered volatility. Nevertheless, meme coin Shiba Inu has retained a bullish stance, witnessing remarkable community developments. Here’s a brief collection of some of the top crypto market updates reported by CoinGape Media over the past week. Bitcoin & Top Crypto Remain Turbulent BTC price closes the week at the $94K level, a mark indicating that the coin reversed recent gains. However, long-term prospects for the asset are still bullish as market participants reflect a buy-the-dip sentiment. Despite a volatile action, American company KULR announced that it purchased $21M worth of BTC, sparking market optimism. However, Bitcoin ETFs have seen slight outflows this week, sparking an uncertain investor sentiment. It’s noteworthy that Japan has rejected a Bitcoin National reserve proposal amid the recent volatile trend, sparking market speculations. Nevertheless, Robert Kiyosaki has given a bold prediction for BTC price, proclaiming it to hit $350K by 2025. Although recent market trends reflect volatility, market watchers remain optimistic about future movements in the wake of the abovementioned news. On the other hand, CoinGape reported that despite the turbulence in the broader sector, even Altcoins are seeing remarkable gains ahead. Notably, popular market expert Titan of Crypto hinted towards a bullish path ahead for the crypto market. In addition, renowned crypto expert Michael van de Poppe also remained bullish on the altcoin market’s future. Overall, market watchers are eagerly awaiting a market recovery in the coming days, with the bull run expected to continue in 2025. Shiba Inu Sees Remarkable Community Advancements Meanwhile, the renowned dog-themed meme crypto SHIB has seen remarkable community developments. Shiba Inu lead developer Shytoshi Kusama confirmed the TREAT token launch earlier this week. Simultaneously, the community also witnessed ‘SHIB: The Metaverse’ launch this week. In addition, Shibarium addresses crossed the 2 million mark, adding to market optimism surrounding the meme coin. Also, the SHIB burn saga has continued reducing the token’s circulating supply, paving a bullish path for future movements.

This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homosexual Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homosexual Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Homosexual Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homosexual Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homosexual Pepe by entering its contract address – 92xPeBxtanptFH9AYsRtwRMq7cWWw9GHfxaspwpNvCTP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-29 06:05:00

Here’s when and Top Price Targets,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-xrp-is-poised-to-continue-rally-heres-when-and-top-price-targets/,"XRP has entered a crucial phase in its price movement, as highlighted by an analysis posted on X by popular analyst Dark Defender (@DefendDark). The digital asset mimics a correction structure seen in a four-hour time frame, now reflected on the daily chart. If this structure holds, the correction is expected to conclude within the next ten days. Hi all. I hope you all are fine. XRP mimics the correction structure, similar to a 4-hour time frame. If true, the correction will be completed within ±10 Days on the daily structure. In Patreon, we have gone through the details and called this a Bull Flag on the Weekly Chart… pic.twitter.com/e3w7LPhWo6 — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) December 27, 2024 Dark Defender has classified the ongoing correction as part of a larger bullish setup. In early December, he identified this pattern as a bull flag. This formation, commonly associated with strong upward momentum, targets an initial price of $8.67 after completion. However, before aiming for this ambitious target, XRP must complete the current corrections on the daily chart. As of December 26, XRP found significant support at $2.13. At press time, the asset was still trading at that level. The analyst described this development as a positive sign for the token’s momentum. Trendlines and Fibonacci retracement levels currently align, providing traders with a clearer view of the market’s potential movements. Key Levels to Watch The analysis emphasizes the importance of specific support and resistance levels in guiding XRP’s trajectory. The critical support levels to monitor include $2.03, $2.11, $2.13, and $2.17. The digital asset formed this support after its recent rise above its 2021 peak of $1.96 in early December, and the support has formed an upward trendline under the digital asset’s price movements. Meanwhile, resistance levels are identified at $2.22, $2.42, and $2.69. The resistance forms a downward trendline to complete a symmetrical triangle on the digital asset’s price chart. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Breaking through the resistance at $2.69 is pivotal for XRP to move toward its long-term target. Conversely, maintaining support above $2.03 is essential to avoid a deeper retracement that could hinder bullish momentum. Can XRP Reach $8.67? The market outlook for XRP remains optimistic, provided it adheres to the outlined support and resistance thresholds. The daily correction phase appears necessary for the token to consolidate before advancing. XRP is expected to continue its bullish trajectory, with the daily correction phase as a temporary consolidation period. Another analyst recently predicted a rise to $8 for XRP, and if the outlined conditions are met, the asset is likely to aim for higher price targets soon.

It’s difficult to predict if this pattern will break to the upside or downside, but this type of consolidation is often a precursor to a major move in either direction. Currently, the price is staying within a defined range, and the market is trying to determine its next move. Sideways action may feel boring, but it’s a healthy market behavior, allowing the price to gather strength before pushing higher. As long as XRP holds above key support levels, especially the $2.04 price level, the bullish trend remains intact. A breakout above this consolidation phase could send XRP to test higher levels, with $3 being a potential next resistance level, and even higher towards the all-time highs. Price Levels to Watch $2.04 Support : This is a critical level for XRP. If the price holds above this level, the bullish scenario remains intact. A drop below $2.04 would invalidate the short-term bullish outlook and open the door for a bearish reversal. $3 Resistance : If the price moves higher, $3 will be an important resistance zone. A successful breakout above this level could pave the way for XRP to reach its all-time high. Bearish Scenario If XRP breaks below the $2.04 level, the bearish scenario becomes more likely. In this case, the price could move lower, targeting the support zone between $1.8 and $1.79. A sustained drop below $2.04 would suggest that the market is preparing for a larger correction, and further downside could follow. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.17 and is up by more than one percent in the last 24 hours.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-29 06:23:31

XRP Linear Regression Shows Time and Target Projections,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-to-27-5-xrp-linear-regression-shows-time-and-target-projections/,"A recent analysis by EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto), a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency space, has provided a detailed outlook into XRP’s future trajectory using a linear regression channel on a logarithmic scale. This method captures approximately 68% of price movements within a defined trend, offering valuable insights into market behavior. Linear regression is a powerful analytical tool that helps identify key price levels, reversal points, and overall market trends. It uses a central trendline alongside upper and lower bands to define potential overbought and oversold zones. Prices often revert to the mean over time, a phenomenon referred to as mean reversion, which makes this tool particularly useful in predicting price movements. #XRP Linear Regression: Time & Target Projections ($6.4, $8.5 or $13.7, $27.5 – March Or November 2025): Key Features of the Linear Regression Channel (Log Scale): Brief Overview: Linear Regression with (-/+1 Standard Deviation) creates a channel around the trendline that… pic.twitter.com/mzS0mOpHJO — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 27, 2024 XRP Milestones in 2025 EGRAG CRYPTO’s analysis projects significant milestones for XRP by 2025. By March, he expects the price to reach approximately $6.4, which aligns closely with the Fibonacci 1.618 retracement level on the lower scale he marked in green. Beyond this level, a potential breakout could push the price to $8.5, associated with the Fibonacci 1.272 retracement level on the higher scale marked in white. This level is close to the $8 target he recently predicted for the digital asset. These targets represent significant growth and are supported by historical price behavior within the regression channel. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The analyst also identified an intermediate price of $4.4 as an important milestone in this upward movement. This figure aligns with the Fibonacci 1.414 on the lower scale. While $4.4 is notable, EGRAG CRYPTO’s analysis suggests that XRP can exceed this level. He also discusses the possibility of a cycle blow-off top, where XRP could reach prices between $13.7 and $27.5. This range corresponds to Fibonacci levels 1.414 and 1.618 on the higher scale, indicating a peak in bullish activity. EGARAG CRYPTO identifies November 2025 as another critical time frame for these upper price levels, suggesting that XRP’s price action will be heavily influenced by broader market trends and sentiment during this period. EGRAG CRYPTO emphasizes that price action typically leads market narratives, highlighting the importance of analyzing technical indicators to anticipate potential developments. This forward-looking perspective shows the significance of using tools like linear regression and Fibonacci levels to understand market dynamics. In addition to EGRAG CRYPTO’s opinion, many prominent analysts have weighed in on XRP’s future, sharing bullish expectations for the digital asset.

Thorn noted that the government would instead maintain its Bitcoin reserves while discussions about a Bitcoin reserve policy continue. Exploring a Bitcoin Reserve Policy “There will be some movement within the departments and agencies to examine an expanded Bitcoin reserve policy,” Thorn said. Currently, the US government holds 183,850 BTC, valued at approximately $17.36 billion, spread across various known addresses, according to Spot on Chain. Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis has proposed the Bitcoin Act 2024, which, if enacted, would allow the US to include Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. This would involve purchasing 200,000 BTC annually for five years, accumulating 1 million Bitcoin to be held for at least 20 years. Nation-State Competition for Bitcoin Galaxy analyst “JW” predicted that up to five Nasdaq 100 companies and five nation-states might add Bitcoin to their balance sheets or sovereign wealth funds. He suggested that increased US involvement in Bitcoin could trigger a competitive rush among nations to mine or acquire Bitcoin. “Competition among nation states, particularly unaligned nations, those with large sovereign wealth funds, or even those adversarial to the United States, will drive the adoption of strategies to mine or otherwise acquire Bitcoin,” JW explained. Global Perspectives on Bitcoin Reserves On Dec. 26, Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba expressed uncertainty about the US and other countries adopting Bitcoin reserves, stating, “It is difficult for the government to express its views.” Meanwhile, former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao suggested that China might adopt a strategic Bitcoin reserve. At the Bitcoin MENA conference in Abu Dhabi on Dec. 9, Zhao said smaller countries would likely lead in adopting Bitcoin reserves, albeit at a gradual pace.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|RESEARCH|BNB,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-29 06:55:00

Meanwhile, the innovative Remittix (RTX) continues its meteoric rise, fueled by groundbreaking payment solutions and strong investor demand. Will WIF and BONK stray from their bearish tendencies, or is RTX going to be the next 100x altcoin in the crypto market? Read on to explore why these top altcoins are the focus of market excitement and which one might provide the most returns in 2025. Is Bonk (BONK) Poised for a Breakout? With an amazing 18% increase over the previous week, the Bonk coin is causing waves in the meme coin market . The weekly Bonk price chart shows, however, that this recovery happened inside a protracted consolidation phase between $0.000028 and $0.000035. The past month presented a bleak picture for Bonk holders despite this temporary rise; the Bonk price dropped by nearly 22% and tested the $0.000025 support level. Positive momentum started to show close to this important support zone, driving the Bonk coin back above $0.000030 and inspiring hope among holders. Although the Bonk price is still erratic, the community sentiment toward the memecoin has remained bullish. On November 20, Bonk reached an all-time high (ATH) of $0.000059; holders are now excitedly awaiting another ATH, possibly by January 2025. With Moving Averages showing a positive long-term trend on the Bonk price chart, the sell indications of the Momentum Oscillator advise caution. Can Dogwifhat (WIF) Bounce Back to ATH? The Dogwifhat price moved very little during the past week, rising by less than 1% as it consolidated between $2.28 and $1.78. Although there was little weekly movement throughout this time of massive consolidation, the prior month was notable for steep Dogwifhat price falls. The meme coin has plummeted around 40% in the past 30 days, according to the Dogwifhat price chart , which reflects a bearish trend. Notwithstanding these obstacles, public opinion of Dogwifhat (WIF) is still very positive; many predict a comeback and a possible all-time high (ATH) by Q1 2025. Although the Dogwifhat price is right now more than 60% below its ATH, its location on a significant bullish trendline on the annual chart makes it one of the promising altcoins to watch . As this meme coin tries to rebuild lost momentum, investors are closely monitoring it. Still, care is urged as on the Dogwifhat price chart both Oscillators and Moving Averages show bearish signals . Dogwifhat is an interesting prospect in the meme coin market for those ready to take a measured risk because of its great community support and the possibility for a major breakout in the near future.

Accompanied by a technical analysis chart, Amonyx draws attention to a confirmed golden cross, a bullish technical indicator often associated with long-term upward momentum in asset prices. #XRP GOLDEN CROSS CONFIRMED Are you mentally prepared? pic.twitter.com/BxgNHwoSWL — Amonyx (@amonbuy) December 27, 2024 Chart Patterns and Implications The attached chart reveals key historical patterns for XRP. It shows that the asset has formed multiple accumulation phases followed by breakouts. Notably, the all-time high of $3.84 in January 2018 was followed by a prolonged consolidation period that lasted several years. The price remained subdued in a wide range, struggling to break past significant resistance levels. The chart highlights two primary green-shaded zones representing extended periods of consolidation. Both instances culminated in sharp price movements when XRP successfully broke out of its range. The most recent breakout has helped XRP to surpass critical resistance levels and reach $2.86, the highest price since its 2018 all-time high. The asset is trading at $2.15, but these bullish signs suggest an imminent rise, potentially surpassing its 2024 peak of $2.86. Amonyx also points to the formation of a golden cross , a technical event when a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average. This indicator is traditionally interpreted as a sign of potential sustained bullish momentum. In this context, it reinforces optimism surrounding XRP’s trajectory.

Ripple’s legal challenges with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have long held XRP down. However, recent political changes could shift the regulatory sentiment. Gary Gensler, the current SEC Chair, has announced his resignation , effective January 20, 2025. President-elect Donald Trump’s nomination of Paul Atkins, a figure perceived as more favorable to crypto, has fueled speculation about regulatory relief for Ripple and similar entities. The sentiment within the crypto community is overwhelmingly bullish, as reflected in Amonyx’s enthusiastic post and the community’s reactions. The digital asset’s confirmed golden cross and recent breakout above the $2 level are significant events. These developments align with a broader narrative of optimism, and the asset could experience a massive rally sooner than many expect.

Prince Elon (ELONPRIN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONPRIN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Prince Elon can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Prince Elon could become the next viral memecoin. Prince Elon launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Prince Elon on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Prince Elon by entering its contract address – 7rAsmWGTtPFY9RFnhd9biard7PrWtw5ZigowwfmaXUQ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONPRIN.

This whale had accumulated a total of 23.45 million FTM tokens at a price of $0.618 approximately two years ago. However, the whale wallet may be waiting for the Fantom (FTM) tokens to be rebranded as Sonic (S) or it may sell.

The analyst predicted that the flagship crypto will reach $140,000 and revealed when this price surge could likely happen. When The Bitcoin Price Will Jump To $140,000 In an X post, Crypto Jelle predicted that the Bitcoin price could rally to $140,000 in the next three months. This came as the analyst highlighted a cup and handle pattern, which put BTC’s price target at this level. Crypto analyst Titan of Crypto also suggested that Bitcoin could rally to $140,000 in the next three months. In an X post , the analyst shared an accompanying chart, which he tagged as the ‘Bitcoin 2025 Roadmap.’ The accompanying chart showed that the Bitcoin price could reach $140,000 at the start of the new year. However, this price is unlikely to mark the top for Bitcoin, as it could still surge to $150,000. Other market experts have even provided a more bullish outlook for the flagship crypto. Engineer Ted Boydston predicted that BTC could hit $225,000, the biggest bull run for the flagship crypto. Meanwhile, renowned finance author Robert Kiyosaki predicted that the flagship crypto will hit $350,000 in 2025. While it remains to be seen if the flagship crypto could reach such heights, fundamentals such as Donald Trump’s inauguration support a bullish continuation. A Price Rebound Is Imminent In an X post, crypto analyst Ali Martinez stated that the Bitcoin price could be preparing for a rebound. The analyst mentioned that Bitcoin is showing a bullish divergence on the hourly chart against the Relative Strength Index (RSI). The analyst added that the percentage of Binance traders going long on BTC has increased from 53.12% to 64%. These traders are said to have a solid record of being right. Martinez further stated that the Bitcoin price needs to break above $94,800 to confirm this rebound. A break above this level could send BTC to $95,300 or even $96,000. On the flip side, the analyst warned that if Bitcoin drops below $93,600, the bull case is off the table as the flagship crypto could drop to $84,000 or even $70,000. However, the bullish case is looking more likely. In another X post, the analyst revealed that there was a spike in Bitcoin’s Taker Buy/Sell ratio on the top crypto exchange OKX. This indicates a surge in aggressive buying, which is a sign of upward momentum ahead.

The crypto analyst sees possible scenarios to fill the CME gaps. In one scenario, XForceGlobal suggests it could be filed through a deep wave or wave-4 correction, bringing Bitcoin down to the $77,000 to $80,000 level. In another scenario, XForceGlobal said it can be filled “at a later stage via the assumed 1-2 correction after we finally finish off this bull run’s impulse,” a scenario which might result in the BTC to plummet to $46,000.

Expect a market dump on Inauguration Day (January 20, 2025). This could be the perfect local top for a sell-off, likely leaving many newcomers in a panic,” the crypto analyst said. Egrag outlined two scenarios that might unfold from the current market condition, suggesting that in one scenario, Bitcoin could pump to $120,000 and later experience a dump to the CME GAP before “resuming the bull run in 2025.” In another possible scenario, the crypto analyst said that BTC could drop to the CME gap of $70,000 to $75,000 level before the resumption of the bull run.

The outcome of a breakout from this range will likely set the tone for its next significant market direction. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart Cardano has recently encountered a rejection at the $1.3 resistance level, triggering heightened volatility and a descending retracement phase. As a result, the price settled at the $0.75 support zone, which coincides with a significant prior yearly swing high and is laden with demand and buying interest. This support has halted further downside momentum, keeping ADA confined within the $0.75-$1.3 range. This consolidation phase suggests a build-up of market pressure, with the potential for a decisive breakout on either side. A bullish breakout above $1.3 would signal the initiation of a sustained uptrend, while a bearish breakdown below $0.75 could result in a significant liquidation cascade, pushing the price toward lower support levels. The 4-Hour Chart On the shorter timeframe, Cardano’s price action has been shaped by a descending wedge pattern, a formation that often indicates a potential bullish breakout if the upper boundary is breached. Currently, the asset is hovering around the wedge’s lower boundary, near the $0.75 support zone, where increased buying interest is evident. This area is further reinforced by the critical 0.5 ($0.82)-0.618 ($0.7) Fibonacci retracement levels, solidifying it as a formidable barrier against further selling pressure. In the mid-term, ADA is anticipated to continue consolidating within this wedge pattern while maintaining its position above these key Fibonacci levels. A bullish breakout from the wedge could pave the way for an advance toward the $1.3 resistance. Conversely, a bearish breakdown below the wedge’s lower boundary might trigger a deeper decline, with the $0.5 threshold emerging as the next significant support level.

The Travel Rule is part of the EU’s broader crypto regulation strategy and is designed to combat money laundering, the regulation mandates greater transparency in digital asset transfers by requiring cryptocurrency exchanges to collect detailed information about transactions. However, Crypto.com has preemptively implemented measures, prompting concerns about privacy and user rights. The Travel Rule will require users to disclose the names of the beneficiary parties and details about the origin of funds for both incoming and outgoing digital asset transfers. Although the regulation aims to protect against illicit activity, it disrupts the anonymity and decentralization that are fundamental to cryptocurrencies. Early Restrictions From Crypto.com Crypto.com recently introduced these compliance measures for XRP transactions, even before the Travel Rule’s official implementation date. According to screenshots shared on X by Edoardo Farina, creator of Alpha Lions Academy and prominent crypto personality, users must provide additional information about XRP deposits before their funds are credited. Farina expressed frustration on social media, stating, “Despite the ‘Travel Rule’ not taking effect until December 30, Crypto.com refused to credit my funds automatically.” Farina also questioned why such requirements were enforced for a transaction conducted within his home country on December 27, arguing that the Travel Rule specifically applies to cross-border transfers.

We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Broader Problems With Centralized Exchanges These developments follow recent controversies involving major exchanges. One prominent example is Coinbase, which recently faced criticism for account restrictions and limited customer support. As centralized exchanges tighten compliance measures, proponents of decentralization argue that non-custodial wallets and decentralized exchanges are more aligned with the original ethos of cryptocurrencies. Crypto.com’s early implementation of the Travel Rule illustrates a broader trend of increasing oversight in the crypto industry. While these changes are limited to the EU, they come at a time of shifting regulatory dynamics worldwide. In the U.S., the incoming administration led by Donald Trump is widely seen as pro-crypto, and analysts expect more favorable policies that could boost the industry’s growth . With the Travel Rule’s official enforcement just days away, the coming months will likely see further debates about the implications of such regulations for the future of digital finance. After years of struggling in the U.S., the crypto market will finally be free to shine, and the U.S. could become the crypto capital of the world as Trump promised.

This moment is pivotal in determining whether ADA can maintain its ground or face further declines. The broader cryptocurrency landscape mirrors this tension, with Bitcoin lingering just under the $95,000 mark and other major cryptocurrencies also experiencing downturns. ADA price hovered at $0.8748 today, marking a slight increase of 0.67% over the past day. The Cardano token saw its value fluctuate between a low of $0.8666 and a high of $0.8944 within the same period. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has lingered below the baseline, indicating a bearish trend might be settling in. Furthermore, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) stood at 43, reflecting a neutral momentum without leaning heavily towards overbought or oversold conditions. Cardano Price Chart: TradingView Is More Bearish Ahead for ADA Price? As bearish pressures intensify, there’s a chance Cardano could fall to lower support levels at $0.80, $0.70, or even $0.50, potentially signaling a robust market selloff and an opportunity for investors to buy the dip. Conversely, a bullish resurgence could propel the top altcoin price back above the $1.00 milestone. Recent data shows that Cardano price movements correlate with whale transactions exceeding $100,000. Notable spikes in such transactions have preceded significant price changes, emphasizing the impact large-scale investors have on ADA’s market dynamics. This trend underscores the importance of monitoring whale activity for predicting potential market shifts in the cryptocurrency landscape. Source- Santiment As ADA tests its resilience at critical lows, it’s time to strategize. Assessing market trends and whale activities may guide decisions, ensuring readiness to act as Cardano’s price landscape evolves.

In a new CNBC interview, Belshe says that despite the crypto industry already being bullish on the new pro-crypto administration arriving in Washington D.C., it’s possible that the new regulatory environment hasn’t been completely priced in yet. “I think the regulatory is somewhat priced in but in general we’ve seen that these news events don’t always price in until they’re actually here. So look, we have a new administration coming in, things look very promising, people are very excited, they’re very bullish. But it’s not here yet. So actually I think we’re going to continue to see the effects of that all through 2025. Remember that for the last two and a half years, we’ve had not just a regulatory environment that didn’t want to help you, we had a regulatory environment that was actively trying to kill you. So all of a sudden with that changing in the opposite direction, we’re going to continue to see good gains next year.” When asked about whether we will see more companies add Bitcoin ( BTC ) to their corporate treasuries, Belshe says “It’s absolutely going to happen.” According to the CEO, the biggest companies simply have too much cash lying around that is predictably getting debased by the increase in monetary supply – making BTC allocation a viable strategy. “We’re talking with multiple clients right now about doing that. It’s been a conversation for the last couple of years but frankly, the regulatory changes make it a lot easier. Having ETFs available makes it a lot easier. People don’t remember exactly how much balance sheet cash some of the top seven companies have. It’s hundreds of billions of dollars. So having some access to Bitcoin into that portfolio into that treasury management just makes sense. And remember it’s a hedge against whether the US can curtail inflation. And while we’re optimistic about what’s going to happen with the new administration over the next few years, America has not had a track record at all of being able to curtail spending. So if we’re going to continue to see monetary supply go up, Bitcoin is the perfect hedge against that.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $94,912.

Legendary chart trader Peter Brandt recently shared a bullish wedge pattern suggesting another leg up for XRP’s price to above $2.70. The average exchange rate in US dollars for XRP on Saturday, Dec. 28, was $2.19. So if this rally materializes, it would represent a 24% increase over Saturday’s price in potentially a matter of mere days or weeks. Here are two views of $XRPUSD a weekly chart and a daily chart Strong opinions, weakly held A chart is not an opinion and an opinion is not necessarily a position – this is a concept hard to understand by rookies pic.twitter.com/SvaT5hojLW — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 27, 2024 While this is not abnormal for crypto markets in general or for Ripple token prices in particular, these kinds of gains are significantly headier for investors’ finances than the typical performance of corporate equity shares— even for high-flying tech stocks like those on the Nasdaq. Another XRP watcher recently targeted a $4 all-time high Ripple price for the cross-border settlement token on the next big pump. That would represent an astounding 82% gain over the current price. Looking back, here’s how Ripple got here over the course of 2024: 1. Ripple Expert Touts XRPL’s DeFi Powers (Jan. 1) Ripple made some waves to start the year when XRPL developer Wietse Wind settled some misconceptions about the platform. The developer who started the XRP Ledger for decentralized finance using XRP tokens cleared up the confusion once and for all: With XRP Ledger, the native tokens can be used on a fully decentralized platform with smart contract issuance. That makes it more like Ethereum and Solana than many cryptocurrency investors are aware of even today. Wind also blasted through the FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) around regulatory threats to XRP’s economy with a recap of Ripple Labs’ decisive victories against the US Securities and Exchange Commission in the US District Court Southern District of New York. 2. XRP Ethereum Integrations Launch (Feb. 11) One of the key supports for continued, robust growth in XRP’s market valuation is its aggressive expansion into new business partnerships around the world and new integrations with support for XRP on other blockchain networks like Ethereum. In February, the CEO of Peersyst Technology, a Ripple Partner, announced a new Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) sidechain of the XRP Ledger would begin rewarding validator nodes with XRP tokens. That’s something nice for die-hard XRP Army types, who don’t have to sell the tokens to use them with Ethereum smart contracts. 3. XRP Expands in Korea and Japan (July 21) While fighting off SEC allegations of securities fraud in US court, Ripple Labs continued to advance its platform with several new overseas business partnerships this year. They will be key to growing the Ripple economy and seriously competing with SWIFT for daily payment share. In July, Ripple Labs achieved two new international expansions in the Asia-Pacific region— one in South Korea and another in Japan. In Korea, the nation’s only government-licensed VASP (virtual asset service provider), Infinite Block, announced new XRP Ledger support. The integration came mere days after Ripple Labs’ announced the creation of a new XRPL Japan and Korea Fund. 4. SEC Lawsuit Fine Cut From $2B to $150M (Aug. 8) On Aug. 8, US Judge Analisa Torres handed Ripple a resounding win in the US District Court Southern District of New York in Manhattan. The SEC was seeking a $2 billion disbursement or fine for Ripple Labs over allegations of selling XRP as an unregistered security. After the judge delivered the company three other landmark wins last year, both for Ripple Labs and for the blockchain sector in general, Torres struck a devastating blow to the government litigant in this case in August. Instead of the $2 billion the SEC sought, Torres ordered Ripple to pay a comparatively paltry $125 million. 5. Grayscale Launches XRP Trust (Sept. 12) In September, the XRP economy made a massive stride toward market adoption by regulated institutional players trading on Wall Street. Cryptocurrency asset management company Grayscale announced on Sept. 12 the creation of a new US-regulated XRP trust product. That’s similar to the Bitcoin ETFs and Ether ETFs (exchange-traded funds) that the SEC greenlit on Jan. 11 and May 23. The difference between an ETF and a trust, however, is that the former are open funds, and the latter are closed-ended. That means ETFs can issue new shares to meet demand, while trusts have a fixed number of shares from the outset. Trusts can also only be traded once per day at the end of the trading day in New York City. According to Grayscale data, the new XRP trust is set to close out 2024 with 300% gains for investors. 6. SEC Lawsuit Expedited Judgement For Ripple (Nov. 28) Ever since the SEC first sued Ripple Labs in Dec. 2020 for allegations of selling unregistered securities, Ripple has repeatedly prevailed against the US regulator in court. The judge over the case ruled in July 2023, for example, that secondary sales of XRP are not an investment contract and, therefore, it is not an unregistered security. Then, in Oct. 2023, the SEC dropped Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and founder Chris Larsen from their litigation, who were originally named as defendants in its multi-year lawsuit, leaving just Ripple Labs to fight in court. Finally, after getting its fine cut this August from $2 billion to $150 million, Ripple Labs won another battle on Nov. 28, when Judge Torres ruled to expedite the final judgment in the case. 7. XRP Flips BNB and Solana (Dec. 1- 2) XRP tokens traded on crypto exchanges have been racing two other altcoins neck-and-neck for the total market capitalization or market value of their economies. After flying up the price chart following Donald Trump’s reelection to the White House in November, XRP’s price managed to flip BNB (Binance Coin) in terms of total market cap on Dec. 1. Then it flipped SOL (Solana) on Dec. 2, ranking XRP the third largest cryptocurrency (excluding stablecoins) in the world, behind only Bitcoin and Ethereum. 8. XRP Notches 7-Year High Price (Dec. 2) In addition to flipping BNB and SOL tokens, XRP soared to a 7-year record high price on Dec. 2 of almost $3. That portends vigorous support for its market prices going forward as Bitcoin continues to track through its fourth quadrennial macro-market cycle based on its scheduled supply adjustments.

This rising DeFi coin is part of an ecosystem that stands out for its unique features. It offers no transaction taxes, letting users keep more profits. Its staking system rewards holders, creating passive income while encouraging long-term growth. These features are fueling demand among investors seeking big returns. The PropFi coin’s utility extends to funded accounts, where traders can access large capital pools without strict entry barriers. Could this be the best crypto to buy now in the bull market? >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Binance’s Partnership With Circle Triggers Bullish Forecasts For DeFi Coins Binance recently partnered with Circle to challenge Tether’s dominance in the market. Circle’s stablecoin $USDC will be integrated into Binance’s ecosystem. This partnership is expected to bring a lot of new liquidity to Binance’s ecosystem. It could also help BNB’s price reach $700 again soon. Some DeFi coin experts think this partnership will make the first quarter of 2025 very positive for BNB. Following this announcement, BNB’s price went up last month by 43.35% and is now trading for $690 . Experts see a special pattern called a symmetrical triangle, which usually means the future price movement could be bullish or bearish. If BNB breaks out of this pattern positively, it could reach $750. If BNB doesn’t break out, it could drop to $715. Amid this price uncertainty, experts expect DeFi coins like the new PropFi coin to overtake BNB. This is primarily due to the new PropFi platform’s staking rewards program, which gives users passive income for holding the tokens. Cardano Adds $41 Million in ADA Tokens to Circulation Amid Bull Market Resurgence Cardano recently increased its supply by $41 million worth of ADA . On December 16, 2024, $20 million worth of ADA entered the market. Another $21 million followed on December 20. This move caught the attention of Cardano traders, who are closely watching the DeFi coin price. Cardano’s updates have sparked interest among investors looking for the best crypto to buy. With new tokens entering circulation and its price under pressure, all eyes are on ADA’s next move. Recently, ADA dropped to $1.06 , a marginal 11.35% dip from last week. Concerning price predictions, some Cardano experts expect an uptrend for ADA because of the recent rise in its Total Value Unlocked (TVL). This could lead to the rise of the price of ADA to $1.50 amid the bull market. On the other hand, some Cardano analysts have a skeptical outlook for ADA because the crypto market has been slow recently. As such, ADA could drop to $.085 soon. This mixed ADA forecast has investors moving to this new PropFi platform, and this is due to its Trade2Earn feature. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE FXGuys Becomes the Top Choice for DeFi Coin Traders in the Bull Market ADA and BNB holders are flocking to FXGuys ($FXG) due to its PropFi coin. Moreover, with features like a Trade2Earn model, the Trader Funding Program, and zero taxes, FXGuys stands out as a top crypto trading platform this year. Many investors now see $FXG as the best crypto to buy. One key feature is the Trader Funding Program. FXGuys offers up to $500,000 in trading capital to $FXG holders who pass its challenge phase. This helps new and experienced traders boost their income while learning how to trade crypto. The FX Guys platform also rewards active traders with an 80/20 profit split in their favor. Combined with the Trade2Earn model, which pays traders $FXG tokens for every trade, these features make FXGuys popular. Even those still sharpening their trading skills can benefit from extra tokens and potential profits. Profitability is often the top goal for traders. FXGuys introduces a staking feature that offers up to a 20% in APY. Even if you lose on some trades, staking your tokens ensures you still earn. That’s one reason why many now consider $FXG a good crypto to buy for passive income. FXGuys’ no-tax policy is another major draw. Traditional platforms often charge fees, but FXGuys eliminates them, letting users maximize profits. This approach has helped solidify its reputation as one of the best platforms for growing investments. The FXGuys platform has also passed security audits from SolidProof and Soken, ensuring a secure experience for investors. As its PropFi coin gains traction, FXGuys is becoming a standout choice for traders seeking the best crypto to buy ahead of 2025. $FXG Emerges as the Best Crypto to Buy in the Bull Market: Grab This PropFi Coin Now! BNB and Cardano are catching attention as strong investment options during this bull market. Many investors consider these among the best cryptos to buy now. However, the new PropFi coin, $FXG, has quickly gained interest as an exciting alternative in the market. Experts are already calling $FXG the best new crypto to buy. Its public presale is moving fast, with investors eager to grab their share. Some believe that just $100 invested now could grow into $10,000 during this cycle.

The altcoins have recovered some ground from the Saturday correction, with ETH above $3,400 and DOGE aiming at $0.33. BTC Stalls at $95K Last week’s correction erased much of BTC’s price gains charted in December as the asset plummeted to $92,000 on December 21. It managed to bounce off immediately and headed toward $100,000 on a couple of occasions since then = on December 22 and 26 – but to no avail. Each attempt was met with a vicious rejection that pushed the cryptocurrency south by several grand. The last such movement came at the end of the business week, and BTC slumped toward $93,000. It defended that level and jumped to $94,000 yesterday and $95,000 now. This is somewhat expected given the declining trading volumes as of late, which could actually be a blessing in disguise for BTC and other assets if whales continue to make big purchases. For now, though, BTC’s market cap remains well below $1.9 trillion on CG, and its dominance over the alts has been reduced to 54%. Bitcoin/Price/Chart 29.12.2024. Source: TradingView SOL, SUI Recover Most altcoins suffered badly yesterday but have produced some minor increases over the past 24 hours. ETH has climbed above $3,400, XRP is close to $2.2, while BNB continues to defy the market sentiment with a 2.5% jump to $718. Dogecoin has added over 3% of value and stands close to $0.33, while SOL and SUI have gained 5-6%. As a result, SOL now trades above $195, while SUI is north of $4.25. Other notable gainers include HBAR, DOT, AAVE, APT, ICP, and PEPE. The total crypto market cap has recovered about $50 billion since yesterday and is close to $3.5 trillion on CG.

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $100K by the end of 2024 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2030, BTC might touch $270,593 following increased institutional adoption. Bitcoin is approaching a significant milestone, with the potential to hold above $100,000. This surge in value is partly attributed to the broader market response to Donald Trump’s election. Since the beginning of the year, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential of hitting the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Ticker BTC Price $95,221 Market Cap $1,238,914,422,643 Trading Volume $22,318,495,561 Circulating Supply 19,719,062 All-time High $103,900, December 5, 2024 All-time Low $0.04865, Jul 15, 2010 24-hour high $95,563 24-hour low $95.109 Bitcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $95,221 Price Prediction $ 108,001 (5.67%) Fear & Greed Index 84 (Extreme Greed) Sentiment Bullish Volatility 12.34% Green Days 17/30 (57%) 50-Day SMA $ 87,855 200-Day SMA $ 76,476 14-Day RSI 69.34 Bitcoin price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: BTC price analysis shows a consolidation around $95K. Resistance for BTC is at $99,453. Support for BTC/USD is at $92,228. The BTC price analysis for 29 December confirms that Bitcoin is facing increased battle among buyers and sellers. Currently, the BTC price is aiming for consolidation. BTC price analysis 1-day chart: Bitcoin price aims to hold above $100K Analyzing the daily Bitcoin price chart, we see that BTC’s price faces consolidation as it struggles to surge above $100K. In recent hours, the price of BTC faced multiple rejections to move above $96K. The 24-hour volume has surged to $760 million, raising interest in trading today. BTC is trading at $95,221, surging by over 2.5% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin shows volatility The RSI-14 trend line has surged from its previous level but trades below the buying region at 46, hinting that a bearish pressure is on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. BTC/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for an immediate correction The 4-hour Bitcoin price chart suggests that bulls are strengthening their position to hold the price above the EMA trend lines. Bulls are maintaining buying confidence as the BTC price aims for a retest of resistance. Bitcoin aims for immediate correction The BoP indicator trades in a bearish region at 0.52, showing that short-term sellers are taking a chance to accelerate a downward trend. However, the MACD trend line has formed green candles above the signal line and the indicator aims for a positive momentum, strengthening long-position holders’ confidence.

The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC’s price holds momentum above $99,453, it will fuel a bullish rally to $104,717. BTC/USD chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $92,228, beginning a bearish trend to $85,148. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin makes it a good investment option. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile prices. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Why is Bitcoin up today? Following Donald Trump’s victory in the elections, Bitcoin faced increasing buying activity. As a result, the BTC price broke through the $100K mark and formed a new ATH. Will BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price recently broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, forming a new ATH. The price is currently aiming to maintain its buying demand above $100K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 Million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC Robert Kiyosaki predicts Bitcoin may drop to $60,000 but views this as a buying opportunity, expecting it to stabilize around $250K by 2025. BITCOIN to CRASH Bitcoin is stalled short of $100k. That means BTC may crash to $60k. If and when that happens I will not sell. BTC will be having a sale. I will buy more. I predict Bitcoin will settle around $250 in 2025. At this stage of the BTC process… price is not… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) December 1, 2024 Bitcoin price prediction December 2024 November was a bullish month for Bitcoin, characterized by significant upswings. Will BTC price establish a new ATH in December? Bitcoin’s price might attempt to surge toward $100,000 from its recent low and be pushed further, at least $105,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation around $92K. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction December 2024 $92,000 $100,000 $105,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2024 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Bitcoin spot ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2024. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2024 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $110,000 in the highest and the low could be around $88,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction 2024 $88,000 $97,000 $105,000 Bitcoin Price Predictions 2025-2030 Year Minimum Price Average Price Maximum Price 2025 $95,000 $120,000 $160,000 2026 $115,000 $130,000 $185,000 2027 $140,491 $170,100 $216,738 2028 $164,063 $185,068 $244,142 2029 $195,629 $200,312 $255,321 2030 $225,903 $248,568 $270,593 Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 The Bitcoin Halving event’s impact is expected to last into 2025, potentially holding the Bitcoin price above the $100,000 mark. If the global economy strengthens and inflation stabilizes at 2%, interest rates could be reduced by 2025. Clearer crypto regulations could boost BTC investor confidence, leading to more buying demand amid scarcity due to halving. Following the halving event over the next 12-18 months, BTC price is expected to surge toward $160,000, with a minimum price of $95,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2026 Bitcoin might witness a slow growth after 2025’s halving surge, resulting in a surge in selling pressure. However, more financial products including a surge in ETF demand might hold BTC price within a bullish region. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2027 Based on detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491. The potential maximum price is estimated to be $216,738, with an average value of $170,100. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2028 By 2028, Bitcoin’s price is expected to reach a low of $164,063. Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year. Bitcoin Price Forecast 2029 Projections for 2029 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629. The price may peak at as much as $255,321, with an average throughout the year expected to be around $200,312. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2030 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $225,903 and potentially rise to a maximum of $270,593. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $248,568 throughout the year.

Cathie Wood of Ark Invest forecasts Bitcoin may hit $600,000 by 2030, with a potential rise to $1.5 million in her bull case scenario after Bitcoin ETFs approval. Bloomberg Intelligence’s Mike McGlone estimates Bitcoin will reach $100,000 by 2030, attributing the increase to rising demand and BTC scarcity. Robert Kiyosaki predicts Bitcoin price to touch $120,000 by the end of 2024. Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2024, Bitcoin might record a maximum price of $105,000, with a minimum price of $88,000 and an average price of $97,000. However, the future market potential for Bitcoin entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation and investor sentiment in long-term holding. We expect Bitcoin price to create a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin Historical Price Sentiment BTC Price History Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000 and remained volatile with October prices fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. Early 2024 saw Bitcoin rise above $45,000 in anticipation of multiple ETF approvals, despite a brief dip below $40,000 following the ETF approval. Bitcoin’s price surged in February 2024, breaking its previous all-time high from 2021 on March 5th, reaching over $70,000 by March 8th, and setting a new high of $73,750.07 on March 14th. However, in April, the BTC price dropped below $60K. Later in May, the price of bitcoin surged and knocked the $70K level. In the weeks of June and July, BTC price witnessed heavy fluctuations as it hovered within the range of $70K-$55K. In September, the price of BTC surged toward $66K following Fed’s interest rate cut decision. In October, the price of Bitcoin faced an Uptober rally, resulting in a push toward the significant $70K resistance level. In November, the price of BTC witnessed a robust surge following Donald Trump’s victory, nearing the $100K mark. In 2024, Bitcoin casino emerged as a modern and innovative platform for gaming enthusiasts, offering the benefits of anonymity, security, and fast transactions.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|UNI,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-29 08:39:40

His post on X began an intriguing discussion about the different role RLUSD plays, and why cryptocurrencies like XRP remain indispensable. Hope you have read the user terms for RLUSD! Hint: It’s extensive! And it’s crucial knowing the rules in beforehand since Ripple can freeze RLUSD. But it also shows why stablecoins won’t replace cryptocurrencies. pic.twitter.com/DhtcqTpZm4 — Anders (@X__Anderson) December 28, 2024 Limitations On RLUSD RLUSD has comprehensive terms of service. It outlines stringent restrictions on its use. According to the agreement, RLUSD cannot be used for transactions involving regulated products, such as marijuana, tobacco, or firearms, nor for adult content, pseudo-pharmaceuticals, or any high-risk businesses. Ripple broadly defines high-risk businesses, encompassing activities like gambling (e.g., poker or horse racing) unless explicitly licensed by the relevant jurisdictions. Ripple also retains the right to suspend or terminate a user’s RLUSD account if these terms are violated, which could lead to a freeze of funds. As Anders noted, this means users engaging in prohibited activities, such as buying drug paraphernalia or participating in online poker, risk having their RLUSD accounts frozen. While these restrictions align with regulatory compliance requirements and the policies of financial institutions, they illustrate a key limitation of stablecoins: their centralized oversight. RLUSD is notable, as it was approved by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). However, Ripple’s ability to freeze accounts and restrict usage contrasts sharply with the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies like XRP, which operate without centralized control. Decentralization Shows the Importance of Cryptocurrencies This regulatory environment is one of the reasons Anders argues stablecoins are not a replacement for cryptocurrencies. He clarified that his critique is aimed at those who believe Ripple and other entities will exclusively rely on stablecoins like RLUSD for transactions, relegating XRP to a mere “gas token.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Anders’ post shows that stablecoins, while useful for maintaining price stability, lack the censorship resistance and permissionless attributes of cryptocurrencies. “I’m trying to show why XRP and crypto are needed,” he explained. The discussion also highlights the distinct purposes of stablecoins and cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins such as RLUSD are designed for price stability, making them ideal for specific use cases. However, their reliance on centralized issuers and adherence to regulatory frameworks limit their utility in scenarios requiring financial sovereignty and unregulated transactions. In contrast, cryptocurrencies like XRP offer a decentralized alternative, allowing users to transact without the risk of account freezes or usage restrictions. This autonomy is critical in contexts where financial freedom and resistance to censorship are paramount. In a world where free speech is constantly threatened and unnecessarily stringent crypto regulation is becoming the norm, these decentralized assets can play a crucial role in giving autonomy and power to the people.

Trump Cyborg (TRUMPCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCYB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Cyborg launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Cyborg on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Cyborg by entering its contract address – 9yaNQ89EaQ2nEDczZpuTZfDwfiYCxbwSYC4JeiWLDE57 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCYB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-29 08:54:00

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Investors eye Rexas Finance as the next big crypto under $0.20, following Cardano and Ripple’s recent success. Table of Contents Cardano and Ripple’s case Rexas Finance: Big opportunity for the future A powerful, practically useful ecosystem Veracity and confirmed security Conclusion: Now’s the moment to act Investors in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrencies are constantly searching for the next great chance combining ingenuity, strong foundations, and the possibility for exponential rewards. Though well-known coins like Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP) have made news with their recent increases, Rexas Finance (RXS) has lately grown more and more important due to its amazing upside potential. Following Cardano and Ripple’s footsteps, Rexas Finance, presently selling at less than $0.20, seems to be the next cryptocurrency ready for amazing expansion. Strong security credentials, a utility-rich environment, and a very successful presale all help to make RXS’s argument as the best cryptocurrency to monitor in 2024 convincing. You might also like: Rexas Finance poised to be future of RWA tokenization: Fourth presale stage ends earlier than predicted Cardano and Ripple’s case Two outstanding examples of cryptocurrencies that have shown how strategically important benchmarks and market confidence may generate notable price swings are Cardano and Ripple. For instance, thanks in part to partial success in a lawsuit against the SEC and its 40% rise post-U.S election, ripple returned in 2024. This triumph not only cleared regulatory uncertainties but also attracted investor interest, hence raising the XRP value. Cardano’s dedication to technological innovation — especially improvements in its smart contract features — has helped it maintain steady development. Both coins have shown that as well as price rises, consistent performance and a well-defined plan may inspire investor confidence. However, as these cryptocurrencies develop, the possibility of large short-term gains reduces. Here’s where Rexas Finance excels. Rexas Finance: Big opportunity for the future Given its Stage 10 presale of just $0.15, Rexas Finance offers a special chance for investors looking for both quick gains and long-term value. Having sold approximately 375 million tokens, the presale has now generated an amazing $32,834,721, surpassing 99.43% of its aim. Early investors can get a three-fold return by the time of launch from the projected listing price of $0.20; the token price is expected to rise to $0.175 in the next stage. Rexas Finance gives those who lost out on the early development of Ripple or Cardano a second chance to enter the first floor of a viable company. Rexas Finance stands out mostly for its rich ecosystem, which is meant to address practical issues. Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization — a novel idea that closes the distance between conventional banking and blockchain technology — is the main emphasis of this ecosystem. By tokenizing assets, including real estate, commodities, and collectibles, Rexas Finance democratizes access to investment possibilities and lets people participate in markets once controlled by institutions. Fractionalizing ownership reduces entrance barriers, increasing high-value assets’ availability to a bigger audience.

This prolonged stagnation has sparked discussions about a potential correction or deeper retrace as the market awaits confirmation of Bitcoin’s next major move. Both analysts and investors are closely monitoring the situation, eager to discern whether the cryptocurrency will rally to new heights or succumb to selling pressure. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Bought Over 90 Million DOGE In 48H – Details Adding fuel to these concerns, renowned analyst Maartunn recently highlighted alarming on-chain activity. Over 8,000 BTC, aged between five and seven years, have moved on-chain, raising questions about long-term holders’ intentions. Historically, such movements have often preceded market shifts, with increased selling pressure signaling potential weakness. The activity from these seasoned wallets could reflect fading confidence or profit-taking, keeping Bitcoin subdued under the $100K threshold. While bulls and bears remain locked in a battle for dominance, this significant metric underscores the growing uncertainty. As Bitcoin’s trajectory hangs in the balance, market participants brace for clarity on whether this pivotal level will eventually transform into solid support—or mark the start of a downward correction. Smart Money Moving Bitcoin Since early December, Bitcoin has entered a prolonged consolidation phase, struggling to establish clear momentum in either direction. Recent on-chain data suggests that whale activity is playing a pivotal role in keeping the price suppressed. According to top analyst Maartunn, a familiar entity—an old Bitcoin whale—has resurfaced, making significant moves that could influence the market’s trajectory. Maartunn emphasizes that the movement of more than 8,000 BTC echoes a pattern seen just 10 days ago. At that time, the same whale reportedly shifted more than 72,000 BTC in total since the consolidation phase began. This whale, often referred to as “smart money,” has been active like never before, signaling strategic positioning rather than impulsive selling. The implications of this activity are profound. As long as this whale continues to offload BTC, the selling pressure could hold Bitcoin below key psychological levels, extending the current consolidation period for a few more weeks. However, this accumulation and redistribution phase could set the stage for a massive rally once the activity subsides.

BTC Above Key Demand Level Bitcoin is currently trading at $95,000 after managing to hold above the critical $92,000 support level. Despite bears maintaining control over the market in recent weeks, they have been unable to break through the key demand zones at $92,000 and $90,000. These levels have acted as a strong base, preventing further downside and signaling resilience among buyers. If Bitcoin continues to defend these crucial levels, it could pave the way for a swift challenge to its all-time high (ATH). Holding above $92,000 would reinforce bullish sentiment and attract renewed interest from traders and institutional investors eyeing the psychological $100,000 milestone. However, the path ahead is far from guaranteed. A failed attempt to reclaim $100,000 could signal exhaustion among buyers, potentially triggering a deeper correction. Such a scenario might see Bitcoin revisiting lower support zones as market participants reassess their strategies.

However, this billion-dollar collaboration has failed to impact the XRP price, which has been consolidating in a pattern. From the peak formed on 3 December, the XRP price has dropped 26%, suggesting a shift in market sentiments. In the post-Christmas rally, the market favored low-cap utility altcoins like DTX Exchange (DTX), a decentralized hybrid trading platform disrupting the trillion-dollar trading sector. Market experts predict DTX Exchange is potentially heading towards a blockbuster listing in the first quarter of 2025. XRP Price Forms Historic Pattern Amid Correction Despite the ongoing bull run and investors basking in gains, Ripple’s results are not so rosy amidst the market correction. Ripple has decreased 6.03% over the last week, although monthly gains still remain intact. The XRP price has formed a wedge formation which is usually a signal of continuity; nevertheless, some investors are griping about the negative conditions of the market. Courtesy: TradingView The XRP price has local resistance near the upper trendline of the wedge pattern, which has been tested twice since its formation. The lower trendline has continuously worked as support. XRP price is still trading above the 50-period moving average, which is positive because it signals the short-term price direction. The digital asset custody market is expected to grow over the years, and HSBC’s expanding involvement strengthens this outlook. Analysts believe this growing institutional support could drive XRP’s price to $5. By focusing on tokenized securities and custody solutions, Ripple (XRP) and HSBC are well-positioned to benefit from the rising institutional interest in digital assets. Bulls have not favored the XRP price in the short term despite important events such as the HSBC partnership and the recent launch of the RLUSD stablecoin. DTX Exchange (DTX): Pioneering In The Hybrid Technology The DTX Exchange (DTX) isn’t just another crypto project; DTX plots to overturn traditional trading through its hybrid exchange platform. DTX Exchange is building a unified trading experience through the best of both centralized and decentralized exchanges. DTX Exchange’s technical foundation relies on smart contracts. These self-executing agreements operate on the Ethereum blockchain, managing different functions of the platform seamlessly. By leveraging the proprietary VulcanX blockchain, DTX Exchange offers a smooth and efficient trading experience. This blockchain has achieved a remarkable 100,000 TPS in the testnet, surpassing major cryptos like Ripple. DTX also solves the problem of limited capital with its 1,000x leverage, which increases the exposure of a small trader, increasing his profit potential vastly. Security has always been a priority for the DTX team; the platform’s robust security framework ensures user safety from glitches or hacks. It guarantees that only authorized users can access their assets through multi-layer protection features like 2FA and biometric unlocking. The platform also features a non-custodial wallet that gives the user complete ownership. DTX Exchange has successfully conducted a remarkable token presale using innovative technology and a refreshing business approach. In the seventh stage, DTX is currently underpriced and valued at $0.14, giving buyers an opportunity for substantial long-term profits. As the market nears the end of the year, this DeFi platform is emerging as the next big thing. Join now!

Worldcoin is capturing the attention of investors and enthusiasts in equal measure. In the first week of May, Worldcoin’s token, WLD, saw a dramatic rise in its value, positioning it as one of the top-performing altcoins in the market. This surge coincides with heightened activity around artificial intelligence (AI) advancements, particularly those involving OpenAI, hinting at a significant correlation between WLD’s market movements and developments in AI technology. The buzz is partly attributed to speculative reports about potential collaborations and new ventures that could integrate more AI tools into cryptocurrency. Overview Cryptocurrency Worldcoin Token WLD Price $3.82 Market Cap $2.84B Trading Volume $845.50M Circulating Supply 742.26M WLD All-time High $11.82 Mar 09, 2024 All-time Low $0.9758 Sep 13, 2023 24-hour High $3.95 24-hour Low $3.76 Worldcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Prediction $ 12.52 (224.72%) Volatility 19.84% 50-Day SMA $ 2.30 14-Day RSI 73.04 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 72 (Greed) Green Days 18/30 (60%) Worldcoin price analysis: WLD maintains crucial support of $2.0 amid sell-off, eyes recovery Key takeaways : Worldcoin price analysis shows a downtrend, with resilience at the crucial $2.10 support WLD faces key resistance near $2.45 and potential higher targets at $3.00-$3.10. Support remains strong at $2.10, with risks of a drop to $2.00. Worldcoin (WLD) price analysis on December 29th reveals that the cryptocurrency navigated significant market pressure. Following a recent high of $3.85, the coin witnessed a sell-off, leading to a downward trajectory toward $2.12. Currently, WLD is trading near the $2.10 mark, showing a decline in momentum. The sell-off pressure has contributed to weaker buying interest, reflecting broader market uncertainty as the global cryptocurrency market shows signs of mixed sentiment. Despite the downturn, Worldcoin has demonstrated resilience at the $2.20 support zone. This level has been tested repeatedly, suggesting sustained buyer interest, even amid profit-taking activities. The broader crypto market remains volatile, with Bitcoin and Ethereum trading sideways, contributing to subdued activity in altcoins, including WLD. Traders are closely watching whether this support can hold or if WLD may consolidate further in the coming days. WLD/USD daily chart analysis: WLD tests critical support zone The WLD/USD daily chart reveals that the price is currently testing the lower boundary of the Bollinger Bands, positioned near $1.82. This zone represents a critical support level, as a breakdown could signal further bearish momentum. The Bollinger Bands are contracting, suggesting reduced volatility and indicating that a breakout or breakdown may be imminent. The midline of the Bollinger Bands, currently at $2.53, acts as immediate resistance, highlighting a range-bound trading environment. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), sitting at 40.57, suggests bearish pressure as it remains below the neutral 50 level. However, the RSI is nearing the oversold zone, which could attract buyers if the price declines. A reversal in the RSI would be a key signal for a potential bullish recovery. The lack of upward momentum in the RSI reflects weak buying interest, emphasizing the importance of monitoring this indicator for any signs of strengthening. WLD/USD daily chart analysis: WLD tests critical support zone WLD is at a critical juncture, testing support near $2.10 while remaining below its moving averages and resistance levels. A sustained move below the lower Bollinger Band boundary could open the door to further declines toward the $1.80 mark. Conversely, a bounce from this level, accompanied by increasing RSI and volume, could trigger a recovery toward the $2.50 resistance zone. Traders should closely monitor price action around the Bollinger Bands and RSI for directional cues in the coming sessions. 4-Hour chart analysis: WLD seeks momentum at crucial support of $2.20 The WLD/USD pair has displayed fluctuations over the period observed on the 4-hour chart, suggesting a somewhat volatile trading environment. The price has recently stabilized, with candlestick formations showing smaller bodies and less pronounced tails, indicating decreased volatility. This consolidation around the $2.20 mark might respond to both market correction after the previous decline and a period of uncertainty among traders. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), currently at 46.34, hovers near the neutral 50 mark, suggesting that the market is neither overbought nor oversold. This positioning of the RSI indicates a potential balance between buying and selling pressures. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows a more bullish signal, as the MACD line (blue) has crossed above the signal line (orange), and the histogram bars have turned green and are growing in height. This could imply an increasing bullish momentum soon, suggesting buyers gradually gain strength. 4-hour chart analysis: WLD seeks momentum at crucial support of $2.20 The technical setup suggests cautious optimism might be warranted. The positive divergence on the MACD and a stable RSI could lead to a bullish push if sustained buyer interest materializes. However, traders should watch for any changes in volume which could confirm or negate this outlook. The current price level might act as a pivot, with potential resistance near the $2.30 mark and support around $2.10. A breakout or breakdown from this range could dictate the trend direction in the coming days. The $2.00 support level, however, remains critical. This price zone, which acted as a consolidation point during WLD’s earlier rally, continues to attract buyers. Historical data also shows that WLD surged from $1.50 to $4 earlier this year, highlighting the coin’s potential for rapid upward movement when market conditions favor bullish sentiment. What to expect from Worldcoin price analysis As Worldcoin and other similar altcoins face the challenges of large-scale transfers and their impact on market prices, traders can expect WLD to face immediate resistance at $2.80. Surpassing this barrier may set the stage for approaching the psychological mark of $3.00. Conversely, the inability to maintain current levels could lead to a test of the $1.58 support, with further potential declines toward $1.50.

Investing in Worldcoin offers the opportunity to be part of a cryptocurrency project that leverages biometric verification and zero-knowledge proofs to enhance asset security and privacy. Its approach prevents impersonation and supports Universal Basic Income (UBI) distribution, potentially reducing economic inequality. The upcoming World Chain Layer 2 platform, backed by Ethereum’s security, promises efficient user onboarding and robust blockchain operations. These advancements position Worldcoin as a forward-thinking investment in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. Will Worldcoin recover? The current WLD’s price action shows volatility and a slight recovery, suggesting that the cryptocurrency may have the potential for recovery. However, future performance will depend on the crypto market conditions and investor sentiment. Will Worldcoin reach $10? According to long-term predictions, the Worldcoin price forecast expects WLD to reach $10 by 2030. Will Worldcoin reach $100? Worldcoin prediction to reach $100 is highly unlikely due to current market conditions, its present price levels, and the significant rise in market capitalization required. Such an increase would necessitate extraordinary growth and adoption. Does Worldcoin have an excellent long-term future? WLD coin is showing some recovery trend; the token may have a promising long-term future. Continued development, adoption, and favorable market trends will be crucial for its success.

In a recent interview, Giancarlo specifically highlighted the shift from traditional value storage to blockchain-based systems in financial institutions when explaining why Bitcoin’s appeal continues to grow. “We’ve reached a stage where we can move beyond storing information on the internet and store value,” Giancarlo said. “Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies represent protocols that enable this transition to the internet of value.” He said Bitcoin’s rarity is a key differentiator from fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, which continues to lose value due to increasing pressure. Giancarlo made comparisons by noting that while the average American home price has nearly doubled in five years, its value in Bitcoin has drastically decreased, demonstrating Bitcoin’s strength as an appreciating asset. Related News: Cardano (ADA) Founder Charles Hoskinson Talks About Ripple (XRP) Giancarlo also pointed to global adoption trends, noting that countries like El Salvador have benefited significantly from adopting Bitcoin. The country, which made Bitcoin its official currency in 2021, has seen the value of its reserves triple in just two years. With Bitcoin’s rise coinciding with expectations of a more positive crypto regulation in the U.S., Giancarlo believes the technology underlying cryptocurrencies will play a transformative role. “Banks went bankrupt, but the internet hasn’t gone bankrupt in 40 years,” Giancarlo said, adding that blockchain technology could make processes like property transfers instantaneous by eliminating middlemen. *This is not investment advice.

However, that isn’t the same thing as immediately dismissing it. Sometimes there are lower-risk investments, just as there are high-risk investments. Putting all your money into the stock of a startup, even if it does have a “revolutionary business model,” is a higher-risk investment. Sure, you might win big and be one of those savvy visionaries who got in on the ground floor. Statistics say, however, that you are likely going to stay on the ground floor and watch your investment crash. This is why we diversify, which allows us to be able to jump on these high-risk, high-reward deals, but only when a relatively small amount of the portfolio. Where does crypto land in this spectrum of risky investments? That is a difficult question because while many insane meme coins will spike and crash this week alone, that doesn’t represent the crypto market. The last few years have shown that even in spite of a few fads and rough patches, the market itself continues to grow in value and momentum. Nowhere is this clearer than with Bitcoin, the original token that started it all and becomes even more of a legend each year? Following the longer-term trend, Bitcoin’s story is beyond incredible. Will this pattern continue? It’s impossible to say, even if the long-term trend has been very good. What we have a better idea of is that Bitcoin will likely continue to be valuable in the market, and that is enough to create some opportunities. While people can choose to stake their Bitcoin and earn returns via staking rewards, the real question is whether or not they should double down and restake those returns, or cash out and diversify. There are cases to be made for both. A lot of it has to do with what exactly is staked and re-staked. If the staking is done on a general crypto platform with the normal set of features, the odds of a good return may be less than ideal. However, if the staking is tied to something value-added, something that can generate what is called a “positively reinforcing cycle,” it might be worth doing. Let’s discuss the basics of Bitcoin staking, the pros and cons, and the possibility that Bitcoin Validated Services (BVS), as designed by the SatLayer platform, might be able to generate the positively reinforcing cycle ideal for restakers. Restaking Pros and Cons Let’s first explain restaking at its most basic. An investor can stake their crypto to a particular platform, which then uses the frozen assets to build up stability in the platform and the token, while also helping to show the strength of support the platform has. The more assets staked on a platform, the more stable and secure that platform can be. The staked currency helps to generate returns that are then rewarded to the key members of the platform: the stakers, validators, and key participants who might supply a service. These rewards are crucial because they incentivize the actors to play their roles well and accomplish the goals of the platform. The incentives essentially motivate the ability to trust the players to perform with good intentions. When it goes well, everyone does their job well and everyone gets rewarded. The stakers who earn returns then have an important choice: do they cash out or double down, restaking their rewards into the same system in hopes of earning compound earnings? For a staker, there is no clear answer on whether or not it is best to either cash out or restake. They can review past performance gain some insight into the volatility of the token and reward themselves. They can look at what type of returns they might get by investing the returns on something different. Or they can better understand where the rewards are coming from and decide based on that. While the first two choices can offer some insight, it’s the third that offer the biggest understanding of what actions they should take. Simply put, restaking on a normal platform, unless it is incredibly stable, is a high risk. Instead of diversifying, the staker believes strongly that the current positive situation will only continue. However, this is mostly guesswork. But what if the assets being staked weren’t just stable, but were actively creating value? This could reduce the risk of restaking if the value-creating activities are beneficial and have a strong chance of building up the crypto economy. And this is where the idea of Bitcoin Validated Services (BVS) comes in. A BVS is a quickly evolving entity by which a platform can create (through smart contracts) attractive rewards for restakers who will provide support for the platform. They do this by taking a portion of their stake and delegating to an operator. The operators use the staked Bitcoin as collateral to create stability on the platform, and actively perform their duties to help manage the platform itself. They ensure the platform operates efficiently, and securely, and this attracts more users. Because the operators are incentivized to support the platform with their staked Bitcoin, the BVS ensures they are immediately secured in a way that native tokens can never provide. There is no more “security ramp-up” as a native token gains value. Those tokens mean security right away, which gives the platform a much better chance at success, and which means that the operators gain a generous reward. The reward is then turned around and restaked, increasing the overall return as long as Bitcoin continues to build. The “positively reinforced cycle” occurs at this point, and is what turns restaking into less of a gamble and more of an official tool for creating consistent wealth. Stakers want returns, so they delegate their stake to operators. Operators want returns, so they behave well and do their job, earning their and the stakers returns. The platforms benefit from the bolstered security and assets, growing and attracting a larger audience. The audience uses the platform and enjoys it, boosting growth and bringing the process full circle as it attracts new stakers. What Now? While restaking may normally be seen as a risky proposition, when positively reinforced cycles can be created, it’s quite a bit less guesswork to see that things are going well. There are no guarantees in life, but seeing the BVS at work shows that there is a bit of method to the madness. Building up a cycle that adds value at each step, and using a token that continues to grow in value worlds above its contemporaries, is potentially the best way to ensure that restaking rewards are brought back in for continued boosting, continuing this positive cycle for these bold restakers.

Issued on December 27, 2024, the rule mandates these platforms to comply with broker reporting requirements, a move that has sparked outcry across the crypto sector. Limited Options for DeFi Alex Thorn, head of research at Galaxy Digital, has identified three potential paths forward for DeFi platforms under this regulation. According to Thorn, these platforms can either comply and function as brokerages, block access for U.S. users, or adopt extreme decentralization by forgoing upgrades and revenue generation. Thorn emphasized that only highly decentralized platforms—those without front-end interfaces, non-upgradeable smart contracts, and no fee collection mechanisms—could potentially avoid the “broker” designation. “Said another way, extremely decentralized applications are not in a position to know and thus could not comply with broker reporting requirements,” he noted. Industry Pushback and Legal Action The announcement by IRS has ignited fierce opposition from the crypto industry, with executives and advocacy groups labeling the rule as overreach. Bill Hughes, an attorney for blockchain software firm Consensys, criticized the IRS for releasing the rule at the tail end of the year during the holiday season. “This rule has been ready to go for a while. They dump it…as if we wouldn’t notice or make an absolute ruckus over it,” Hughes stated. On the same day the rule was published, a coalition of crypto advocacy groups—including the Texas Blockchain Council, Blockchain Association, and DeFi Education Fund—filed a lawsuit against the IRS. The lawsuit alleges that the rule represents unconstitutional overreach by the Department of the Treasury and the IRS. Industry leaders have also called on Congress to step in and block the rule, arguing that it could stifle innovation and drive DeFi platforms away from U.S. markets. If implemented, the reporting requirements will take effect in 2027, giving platforms some time to adjust or push back. The controversy has reignited debates over the balance between regulatory compliance and innovation in the crypto space.

Despite this impressive achievement, the price of ADA has been steadily falling, causing concern among investors. At the same time, DTX Exchange is making significant strides in the crypto market, attracting attention with its innovative features. In this article, we will discuss the reasons behind ADA’s price decline, the rise of DTX Exchange, and what these developments mean for investors. Cardano’s Price Dip: A Prime Buy Opportunity Amid Market Caution Cardano (ADA) has been losing value steadily since early December, dropping to a low of $0.86 for the month. This decline has made ADA investors worried about the start of the new year. However, some signs show there might be a good chance to buy Cardano for those who think long-term. A Chance to Buy Cardano Cardano’s MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) ratio suggests it might be a good time to buy. Right now, the MVRV ratio is between -13% and -26%, which has been a good range for buying ADA in the past. When the MVRV ratio is in this range, the price of Cardano often goes up again, giving investors a chance to make a profit. Cardano’s Price Drop: Seizing the Buy Opportunity Amid Network Concerns Buying Cardano now could lead to good returns, especially since the cryptocurrency has bounced back in similar situations before. Even though people are cautious right now, the MVRV ratio shows that ADA might be priced lower than its true value, making it a smart choice for investors who plan to hold it for a while. Challenges for Cardano However, there are some problems. The Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio for Cardano is at its highest level in 22 months, which is a bad sign. A high NVT ratio means that the value of the network is much higher than the amount of activity happening on it. This shows that people are not using Cardano as much, and investors are less interested. This difference means that even though Cardano’s price is high, it’s not being used much in real life. Investors should think about this when deciding if Cardano will go up in the short term or grow in the long term. DTX Exchange: A Comprehensive Trading Platform In contrast to investing solely in Cardano, DTX Exchange offers a versatile platform for managing a wide range of assets. DTX Exchange is the first crypto-native platform to provide trading for stocks, forex, ETFs, and over 100,000 currency pairs. This means you don’t need to switch between different platforms to manage your investments—you can handle everything in one place with DTX Exchange. This comprehensive service is powered by the VulcanX blockchain, which is built to work seamlessly with traditional assets like stocks and forex. The VulcanX blockchain has already launched its testnet and is expected to handle over 100,000 transactions per second (TPS), ensuring fast and efficient trading. DTX Exchange: The Future of Mixed Trading Platforms Many utility tokens are mostly owned by big investment firms. When regular traders join the market, these large investors often sell their tokens, which makes the prices go down. Also, some projects release their tokens slowly, which can make your share smaller over time. But DTX Exchange is different. When DTX fully launches on platforms like Uniswap, Binance, and Bybit, its price is expected to be $0.20. Right now, it’s only $0.14. This means early buyers could see their investment grow by up to 80% when it lists. Those who joined in earlier rounds have already seen their investments increase by 500%. DTX Exchange has already raised over $10.7 million, and its presale stage 7 has just started with more than 300,000 wallet addresses participating.

Is It Set to Outshine XRP & Tron’s Crypto Dominance?,https://thecoinrise.com/web3bay-starts-at-just-0-003-is-it-set-to-outshine-xrp-trons-crypto-dominance/,"XRP, Tron, and Web3Bay are transforming the crypto world with their distinct advancements. XRP’s impressive 20% rise to $2 signals a positive market reaction to potential regulatory changes, highlighted by rumors of SEC Chairman Gensler’s impending resignation. Tron maintains its leadership with an impressive Q3 revenue of $577 million and a growing user base. Web3Bay , however, surpasses both with its innovative concept for decentralized e-commerce. Eliminating middlemen and granting users governance through 3BAY tokens, Web3Bay showcases the future of Web3 commerce. Its presale, promising an astounding 6430% ROI for early backers, establishes Web3Bay not just as a cryptocurrency player but as a pioneering ecosystem set to lead. XRP’s Remarkable Price Jump Amid Regulatory Changes XRP has recently seen a significant price jump, with a 20% increase positioning it around $2. This surge stems from speculation around SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s potential resignation, which could lead to a more favorable regulatory environment for XRP and the wider crypto market. This change in regulatory atmosphere has renewed interest in Ripple’s native token as a prime candidate for the next market upswing. Additionally, Robinhood has broadened its crypto offerings to include XRP, enhancing its market presence and attracting more retail investors. Ripple’s ongoing partnerships and its expanding application in cross-border payments further solidify XRP’s real-world utility. Rising on-chain activities within the XRP Ledger are also bolstering positive market sentiment. Analysts suggest that surpassing the $2.5 resistance could lead to further gains, potentially nearing the $3 threshold. Tron’s Exceptional Market Achievement & Growth Tron is currently experiencing robust market momentum, recently reaching a high of $0.1914, supported by increased trading volumes and a revival in investor interest following Bitcoin’s upturn. With over 271 million accounts and 50 million weekly transactions, Tron’s growing ecosystem underscores its escalating adoption and influence. Financially, Tron has exceeded other leading blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, with a record $577 million in Q3 2024 revenues. This highlights Tron’s ability to sustain income through its decentralized finance and application platforms, continually attracting developers and users. Analysts foresee further growth for TRX, with predictions suggesting it might soon approach $0.20. Why Web3Bay Might Be the Top Crypto Venture This Year Web3Bay is redefining e-commerce by shifting away from traditional intermediary-reliant frameworks to a user-empowered decentralized marketplace. This reformation not only saves money but also allows users to influence the platform’s direction through governance rights associated with 3BAY tokens. For early investors, Web3Bay’s presale presents an exciting opportunity, starting at just $0.003 per token. With a planned 28-stage price increase, culminating at $0.1959, early backers could see a return of 6430%, with some analysts forecasting up to a 40,000% ROI, positioning it as an attractive investment prior to 2025. Web3Bay is not just participating in the Web3 evolution; it is spearheading it. As blockchain becomes fundamental to various sectors, Web3Bay is ideally placed to capitalize on this shift. Investing in Web3Bay could be akin to investing in a future rival to giants like Amazon, but with the added advantage of influencing its development. Key Insights As XRP gains from prospective regulatory changes and Tron benefits from its ecosystem expansion and high revenues, Web3Bay leads by transforming e-commerce with blockchain technology. Unlike traditional models, Web3Bay offers users complete control over their data and transactions, removing expensive intermediaries. The 3BAY token goes beyond basic utility by providing governance rights, exclusive rewards, and a chance to shape the platform’s future. Its presale, starting at a mere $0.003 per token, opens up a potential ROI of 6430%, making it one of the most enticing opportunities in the crypto space.

With its innovative watch-to-earn protocol, Script Network aims to redefine how users engage with streaming platforms by incentivizing viewers with SCPT tokens. SCPT Price Analysis and Prediction As of December 27, 2024, SCPT is trading at $0.0087, reflecting a slight decrease of 2.34% over the past 24 hours. Despite this, the token has maintained steady growth since its mainnet launch in October 2024, driven by platform adoption and strategic initiatives. Notably, Script Network's recent 72 million token burn program is set to reduce supply significantly over the next two years. This move aims to enhance SCPT's scarcity and long-term value, aligning with the token's growing utility within the Script ecosystem. Analyst predictions for SCPT vary: CoinCodex forecasts a modest price increase to $0.0122 by early 2025. Bitnation projects a more bullish trajectory, estimating SCPT could reach $0.0235 by the end of 2024. With over 600,000 active users and live availability on 300 million devices, Script Network is positioning itself as a leader in Web3 entertainment, making SCPT a token to watch. PENGU Price Prediction PENGU, the native token of Pengu Finance, has also been drawing attention due to its innovative staking and gaming features. Currently priced at $0.032, PENGU has experienced a notable surge in interest, fueled by the growth of its NFT staking platform. Analysts predict moderate growth for PENGU: CoinCodex estimates a price of $0.039 by January 2025. Bitnation forecasts a year-end target of $0.045, citing the increasing adoption of Pengu's gaming ecosystem. MOVE Price Prediction MOVE, the governance token of MoveFi, a decentralized finance protocol for fitness enthusiasts, is gaining traction for its unique move-to-earn model. MOVE is trading at $0.015, showing steady adoption among fitness-conscious crypto users. Analyst predictions include: CoinCodex suggests a slight rise to $0.018 within the next month. Bitnation is more optimistic, projecting a price of $0.025 by the end of 2024. Final Thoughts With SCPT leading the charge in blockchain-based entertainment, alongside the growing potential of PENGU and MOVE in their respective niches, these tokens represent compelling opportunities for traders and investors alike. However, as always, the highly volatile nature of cryptocurrency markets necessitates careful research and risk assessment. For SCPT, the ongoing adoption of Script Network's ecosystem and its ambitious burn program could prove pivotal in shaping the token's future performance.

In a new CNBC interview, the Fundstrat co-founder and managing partner says the current macroeconomic backdrop will sustain stock market rallies next year. Lee also says he sees investors waiting on the wings to start piling into the S&P 500 in 2025. “I think there [are] a lot more tailwinds building for markets in 2025 than have existed in 2024 mainly because now we’re not worrying about the Fed worrying about inflation and bringing a halt to the economy. We have an election that’s behind us, and now we have a lot of cash on the sidelines and I think companies finally having more courage – what we call animal spirits – and a willingness to start to do mergers and other things like capital markets that help stocks next year.” In October, Lee said that $6 trillion worth of capital that’s been sitting on the sidelines could fuel further stock market surges. He also noted that recession fears have kept many investors from diving into the equity market. “It feels like investors are under-invested in stocks. I think there’s people who’ve dreaded 2024 thinking this is the year we slip into a recession, and instead, and we’re seeing it with earnings, companies have been really resilient.” As of Friday’s close, the S&P 500 traded at 5,970 points.

Homosexual Pepe (HOMOPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homosexual Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homosexual Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Homosexual Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homosexual Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homosexual Pepe by entering its contract address – 92xPeBxtanptFH9AYsRtwRMq7cWWw9GHfxaspwpNvCTP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-29 10:22:00

With several years of operation behind them, landmark wins against SEC regulators in US court, and even Wall Street ETFs for two of them, the crypto assets on this list are less risky for investors than ever before. That doesn’t mean buying these digital assets is without risk any more than buying stocks like Apple or Amazon is without risk. But gone are the days when educated investors must scratch their heads looking at the staggering reports about these currencies’ price gains and wonder if it could be real. They’re currently caught up in the bullish part of a multi-year boom and bust cycle. That means their exchange rates against the dollar have been rising for months and could continue to increase until all market demand has been exhausted. Then, prices are likely to correct again for the remainder of this market cycle. Four Big Cryptos That Beat Wall Street Below is each asset, with a note about how it beat returns from tech stocks in the Nasdaq Composite this year. For reference, the NASDAQ, a broad benchmark for the performance of US tech stocks, gained 33% for the year ending Thursday, Dec. 26. Meanwhile, the four cryptocurrencies featured here gained accordingly: Bitcoin: 126% Ethereum: 49% Solana: 75% Ripple: 247% Over its history, the Nasdaq has taken as long as ten years or more to return this kind of gains to the market value of its stocks. These crypto assets did it in just one year, and it’s by far not the first time they’ve performed this well in a year. 1. Bitcoin (BTC) Yearly Performance 2024: +126% Bitcoin is the original and first-in-class cryptocurrency. It invented the entire segment with its 2009 debut. On Thursday, the Bitcoin economy’s total market capitalization exceeded $1.9 trillion. For the year through Dec. 26, Bitcoin rose 126% over its average Jan. 1 price on crypto exchanges. It is the most traded and most liquid cryptocurrency, as well as the most established, with a hands-off approach by US regulators and several ETF (exchange-traded fund) products available on Wall Street for regulated investors to buy at less risk than using crypto exchanges or self-custody to purchase and secure. In addition to its ongoing unique value proposition, Bitcoin beat the Nasdaq this year for three more proximate reasons: The Wall Street ETF approval for Bitcoin by the SEC on Jan. 10 The four-year BTC supply halving on Apr. 20 The reelection of former President Donald Trump on Nov. 5 Bitcoin’s unique value proposition is its highly secure maintenance of a preciously scarce supply of unique, serialized digital notes on its network. Economists who understand how it works compare Bitcoin to digital gold, which you can send to anyone in the world as easy as it is to send an email. 2. Ethereum (ETH) Yearly Performance 2024: +49% Inspired by the ideas and design behind Bitcoin, Ethereum was the first blockchain smart contract platform to scale to a mass market of users. Smart contracts are like currency on Bitcoin’s network, but they can do more than basic accounting. The idea is powerful, and the possibilities are endless: Smart contracts or decentralized finance (DeFi) networks like Ethereum host programmable money. Imagine you could write a note on a $100 dollar bill that says the first person to meet the requirements on this note gets to have the $100 dollar bill. Furthermore, you could just leave that note posted on a cork board in an office park, and it wouldn’t go anywhere until someone actually did whatever the note requires (for example, leave a note in its place with the solution to a complex problem that would cost you more than $100 to solve yourself). This technology is still new, but it promises to revolutionize finance, law, accounting, insurance, and supply chain management in some way that is comparable to how the Internet revolutionized publishing and retail commerce. Ethereum beat the Nasdaq this year because of: The Wall Street ETF approval for Ether by the SEC on Jul. 22. The Federal Reserve’s pivot to cutting interest rates lower on Sept. 18 The reelection of former President Donald Trump on Nov. 5 Blockchain insights and analytics team CryptoQuant recently noted that key metrics for Ethereum presage a persistently bullish market outlook for ETH tokens for the time being. 3. Solana (SOL) Yearly Performance 2024: +75% Inspired by the success of Ethereum, Solana is another smart contract DeFi platform built with a second-mover advantage of greater network speed and lower fees. While Ether remains the leading DeFi cryptocurrency by market cap, Solana has made enormous strides to close the gap. It still has a ways to go, with some $90 billion in market capitalization Thursday compared to Ethereum’s $400 billion market cap. But cryptocurrency market watchers are eyeing these two closely to gauge the future of the blockchain economy and crypto exchange markets. Solana lagged Bitcoin for ROI growth this year over Jan. 1’s average crypto exchange price, but it bested Ethereum by a pretty margin. Furthermore, it clobbered one of the best years for growth in Nasdaq, with 33% gains for the year ending Thursday, Dec. 26. Solana beat the Nasdaq this year because of: High network throughput and low fees compared to DeFi competitors The Federal Reserve’s pivot to low interest rates and Trump’s reelection The outstanding success of Solana meme coins against its competitors Some of the top Solana memes that stood out this year include Bonk, Pudgy Penguins, Dogwifhat, Fartcoin, Popcat, Gigachad, Goatseus Maximus, and Baby Doge Coin. But beginning crypto investors who don’t know their way around memes are probably safer with the base layer SOL tokens. 4. Ripple (XRP) Yearly Performance 2024: +247% One of the earliest altcoins inspired by Bitcoin, Ripple’s XRP is a decentralized, automated platform for large cross-border payments between financial institutions. Ripple’s XRP tokens are the leading earner on this short list for the year because of pent-up demand as the market is hopeful for a resolution to the SEC lawsuit. The US Securities and Exchange Commission sued Ripple over allegations of selling unregistered securities (those being the XRP tokens for its decentralized payment network). Three US court rulings in Ripple’s favor last year and another this most recent November set the stage for XRP’s over-indexing performance among leading cryptos this year. Ripple beat the Nasdaq because of: Several decisive wins against the SEC in court and hype around potential resolution The Fed’s low rate pivot and Donald Trump’s reelection Ripple’s aggressive push for business partnerships around the world Recent technical analysis of XRP’s price indicates the bull run will continue as long as average exchange rates stay above this key support level.

The EU rule, Regulation (EU) 2023/1113, which is also known as the Travel Rule is expected to take effect across the continent from December 30. The Travel Rule was introduced as one of the broader strategies to check incidents of money laundering and keep industry participants safe. The regulation also promotes transparency by mandating crypto exchanges collect information from transactions. Users are expected to provide details such as the names of users involved in transfers and the origin and destination of funds. However, users were taken aback when a user cried out that Crypto.com had already begun enforcing the rule before the deadline. The development has also forced users to question privacy and user rights concerns. Crypto.com enforces Travel Rule restrictions early According to reports, Crypto.com kicked off the rule, at least regarding XRP transfers. Alpha Lions Academy CEO Edoardo Farina shared the development in an X post. The prominent crypto personality noted that users are now required to provide additional information regarding their transactions before XRP is credited to their account. NOT YOUR KEYS, NOT YOUR CRYPTO 🚨 Europe’s “Travel Rule” for crypto exchanges takes effect on December 30, 2024, but @cryptocom is already taking action. They’re now refusing to credit $XRP deposits unless you provide: 1️⃣ The beneficiary’s name 2️⃣ The origin of the funds pic.twitter.com/FT3tTaYFsG — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) December 27, 2024 Farina highlighted that the development is frustrating, noting that the rule was supposed to take effect on December 31. “Despite the ‘Travel Rule’ not taking effect until December 30, Crypto.com refused to credit my funds automatically,” Farina said. He also asked why the requirements were necessary since he carried out the transactions in his home country, noting that it was only mandatory for cross-border transactions. The crypto personality’s comments are in line with several practices of some centralized exchanges regarding rules and regulations. While some of them carry out enforcement prematurely, others overreach their enforcement. One instance came when the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) first initiated its lawsuit against Ripple and ordered platforms to delist the token. While some waited for users to sell their holdings for other tokens, others delisted the tokens ahead of schedule, leaving users out to dry. Broader criticisms face centralized exchanges Criticisms and controversies of this nature have trailed centralized exchanges in the broader crypto market. A recent one was Coinbase was criticized by the crypto community for blocking and restricting users’ accounts without prior warnings. Although the exchange reserved the right to carry out such actions without notice, the restrictions targeted most of their earliest users, prompting concerns. With centralized exchanges conforming to compliance measures set out by regulators, there has been an argument over their actions in relation to those of their decentralized counterparts. Users argue that decentralized exchange activities align with the ethos of what the crypto industry stands for, while others feel it provides the perfect breeding ground for illegal activities. Crypto.com’s early implementation of the EU’s Travel Rule also shows the increased oversight of regulators in the crypto industry. While the changes are only implemented in the EU, it is only a matter of time before they are implemented worldwide. With the official implementation days away, there will be debates arguing for and against enforcement. Meanwhile, the United States is set to enjoy a booming crypto industry, thanks to the emergence of Donald Trump as the president in its recent election. After years of struggling with regulatory issues, the crypto market in the United States is set to shine. Analysts already expect the United States to take the lead in the global crypto market, a move that Trump said he wants to facilitate.

Shiba Inu: Ethereum-based meme coin with expanding utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a meme coin inspired by Dogecoin but built on the Ethereum blockchain, enhancing its compatibility with Ethereum-based applications. Created anonymously in August 2020 by Ryoshi, SHIB began with a quadrillion tokens, half of which were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Buterin’s donation to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burning of a significant portion of SHIB increased the token’s prominence. SHIB’s integration with Ethereum enables developments like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and plans for an NFT platform and DAO governance. These developments suggest potential for increased utility, making SHIB an interesting asset in the current cryptocurrency market. Conclusion Catzilla is a promising contender in the meme coin space, offering a 700% potential ROI during its presale. With triple utility — governance rights, loyalty incentives, and staking options — it unites crypto enthusiasts, meme fans, and anime lovers. While coins like SHIB may have less short-term potential, Catzilla aims to bring financial freedom to everyone by battling crypto villains together.

TRX reached an all-time high of $0.3004 in January 2018 before dropping below $0.05 a month later; it consistently traded under $0.05 until late 2020, when it began to rise again.

In 2023, TRX maintained a consistent bull run, rising from a low of $0.05. In March 2023, the SEC sued Justin for allegedly selling unregistered securities and promoting Tron and Bittorent tokens. In February 2024, Circle’s announcement to cease USDC on Tron led TRX to correct from $0.1429. TRX held above $0.1234 until mid-May, then dropped to $0.1113. The price rebounded to $0.1398 in July but fell again to $0.1213 in early August. By late September, TRX recovered to $0.166, reaching $0.1691 in October and touched $0.2130 in late November.

It aims to support decentralized applications, much like Ethereum and Cardano. What makes Solana stand out is its focus on faster transactions. It offers flexible development options in many programming languages. At the core of Solana’s ecosystem is SOL, its own cryptocurrency. SOL is used to make transactions, run custom programs, and reward those who support the network. Solana avoids some common solutions like sharding or second-layer add-ons to achieve scalability. Instead, it uses a high-capacity network to handle many transactions at once. This approach may attract developers and users who need a fast and efficient platform. In today’s market, where speed and scalability are important, SOL shows potential. Compared to other coins, Solana’s unique technology offers advantages in handling high-activity services without slowing down. Avalanche Avalanche ‘s AVAX is making waves in the crypto world. This eco-friendly Layer-1 blockchain offers low fees and lightning-fast transactions. It processes up to 4,500 transactions per second, outpacing many rivals. Its unique customizable Subnets let users create their own blockchains. By combining classical and Nakamoto consensus methods, Avalanche achieves transaction finality in less than two seconds. Its three interoperable chains — X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain — handle various operations from transactions to smart contracts. In today’s market, AVAX looks promising. The native token, AVAX, is more than just a coin; it’s essential for transaction fees, staking, and operating Subnets. This strong utility gives it an edge over many other tokens. With a focus on speed, scalability, and sustainability, AVAX stands out as the market values efficiency and eco-friendliness. Its advanced technology and practical uses position Avalanche as a potential leader in the next wave of blockchain development.

As TON & PEPE Coin Price Dwindles, Analysts Say Likely",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/can-lightchain-ai-achieve-100x-growth-as-ton-pepe-coin-price-dwindles-analysts-say-likely/,"As Toncoin (TON) and PEPE coin prices continue to dwindle, market analysts are turning their attention to Lightchain AI , a blockchain platform merging artificial intelligence with decentralized innovation. With features like the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), Lightchain AI is redefining scalability, privacy, and decentralized governance. Analysts believe the platform’s groundbreaking technology, coupled with the momentum of its Lightchain AI Presale , positions it for potential 100x growth. As traditional meme coins lose steam, Lightchain AI is emerging as a top contender for exponential market success. The Case for Lightchain AI- Catalysts for 100x Growth Lightchain AI is set for big growth as experts see up to 100 times returns by 2025. Its new Proof of Intelligence (PoI) way gives rewards ͏to nodes for doing AI work, which makes the network safer and better. The Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) helps run AI jobs on the blockchain easily, drawing in builders to make smart decentralized apps. At this time, LCAI is in the presale stage, giving tokens at $0.004 which has caught a lot of eye from investors. The plan for the project includes a testnet drop in January 2025, then a mainnet start in March 2025 aiming for full use of PoI and AIVM. With uses in health care, money matters, and shipping, Lightchain AI deals with real issues, making it a big change-maker in the blockchain area. Its green design and shared control make it more appealing to eco-friendly investors and builders. As more people use it across various fields, LCAI could turn into a leading asset for long-term money put down. Challenges for TON and PEPE Coin- A Dwindling Momentum Toncoin (TON) and Pepe Coin (PEPE) have recently faced significant challenges, leading to declining momentum in their markets. Toncoin’s price has been under pressure due to a substantial drop in its burn rate, which fell by 85% from September to December 2024. This decrease has led to increased inflation, with the annual rate rising to 0.31%, the highest since August. Additionally, the Total Value Locked (TVL) in Toncoin’s DeFi protocols has declined from $760 million to $275 million, indicating reduced investor confidence. Pepe Coin has also experienced a downturn, with its price dropping by 16.14% over a recent seven-day period. This decline is attributed to waning investor interest and the inherent volatility of meme-based cryptocurrencies. The lack of substantial utility and increasing competition from emerging tokens have further contributed to PEPE’s diminishing appeal. These factors highlight the challenges both TON and PEPE face in maintaining market momentum amid evolving investor sentiments and market dynamics. Why Lightchain AI Could Outpace the Competition Lightchain AI is rapidly emerging as a formidable contender in the cryptocurrency arena, poised to outpace established players like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Pepe Coin (PEPE). Its innovative integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology offers tangible utility beyond the meme-driven appeal of its competitors. Key Features Proof of Intelligence (PoI) is an innovative consensus mechanism designed to reward nodes for performing valuable AI computations, such as model training and optimization, which enhances both network security and scalability. Additionally, the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) serves as a dedicated computational layer optimized specifically for AI tasks. It supports real-time applications and ensures interoperability with popular AI frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. Tokenomics The total supply of LCAI tokens is capped at 10 billion. Of this, 40% (4 billion LCAI) is allocated for presale, providing early supporters an opportunity to fund platform development. Additionally, 5% (500 million LCAI) is reserved for marketing and partnerships to promote the platform and build strategic alliances. The treasury holds 6.5% (650 million LCAI) for future development and community initiatives, while 5% (500 million LCAI) is allocated to the core team with vesting schedules in place to ensure long-term commitment. Roadmap Phase 1 focuses on prototype development, including the creation of PoI and AIVM, establishing a governance framework, and launching community engagement initiatives. In Phase 2, the testnet is deployed, performance is optimized, and feedback from early users is integrated to refine the system. Finally, Phase 3 marks the mainnet launch, with full activation of PoI and AIVM, onboarding of validator and contributor nodes, and the expansion of partnerships to drive ecosystem growth. Analysts are optimistic about Lightchain AI’s potential, citing its technological advancements and strategic roadmap as catalysts for significant growth, potentially achease in value. In contrast, tokens like TON and PEPE have experienced price declines, prompting investors to seek more robust and utility-driven projects like Lightchain AI. By focusing on real-world applications and sustainable ecosystem development, Lightchain AI is well-positioned to surpass its competition and deliver substantial returns to its investors.

Volatility Shares Submits Application To SEC,https://bitcoinist.com/is-solana-futures-etf-coming-volatility-shares/,"Asset management company Volatility Shares has submitted with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) an application to list a Solana futures exchange-traded fund (ETF). This strategic move comes after a host of asset managers applied to launch a spot Solana ETF earlier this year. Will Volatility Shares Increase Odds Of Spot ETF Approval? In a December 27 post on the X platform, ETF Store president Nate Geraci revealed that Volatility Shares has filed for a futures-based Solana ETF with the US SEC. A futures exchange-traded fund provides publicly traded securities that offer exposure to the price movements of a cryptocurrency futures contract (SOL futures contract, in this scenario). For context, futures contracts refer to financial derivatives that allow investors to speculate on the future price of an asset without directly owning it. With the Solana futures ETF, Volatility Shares intends to offer products with three different leverage types, including 1x, 2x, and -1x exposure. The SOL futures ETF with 1x exposure will track the Solana futures price with no leverage, while funds with 2x exposure will provide leveraged exposure and amplify the price movement by 2x. Meanwhile, Solana ETFs with -1x leverage provide inverse exposure, meaning they gain value when the futures contracts decline. According to Geraci, this Volatility Shares’ application might be significant even for SOL spot exchange-traded funds , considering the asset manager’s role in the approval of Ether futures ETFs. The asset management company pushed the Securities and Exchange Commission to greenlight the crypto products in 2023. The ETF Store president highlighted that the filing specifically states, “Solana futures contracts that trade only on an exchange registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.” Bloomberg ETF expert Eric Balchunas also commented on Volatility Shares’ future-based Solana ETF application, stating that it is a welcome development in the crypto space. According to Balchunas, this latest filing bodes well for the success of the spot SOL ETF application. This is wild. Solana futures ETF filing bf Solana futures even exist! Oh and let’s do a 2x while we’re. Hard core.. and prob good sign SOL futures on way which arguable bodes well for spot odds. And this was supposed to be a quiet week! https://t.co/YiwauQfaji — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 28, 2024 Solana Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of SOL stands at around $195, reflecting a 5.5% increase in the past 24 hours.

The market capitalization for meme-based tokens started the month strong at $120.14 billion and surged to a peak of $137.06 billion on December 9. However, a sharp downturn followed, with the total valuation plummeting to $92.67 billion by December 23—a staggering 32.38% decline. Roller Coaster for Memecoins By late December, the market had only slightly recovered, standing at $98.42 billion, which marked an 18% drop from its position at the start of the month. This volatility highlighted a slowdown in momentum for memecoins, despite pockets of investor enthusiasm. Among the key players, Pepe stood out with its erratic performance. Once valued at $0.000026 on December 9, the token saw its price tumble to $0.000017 by December 20. While the token experienced significant gains earlier in the year, its December dip mirrored the larger trend affecting the memecoin ecosystem. The Rise of Pepe and Traders’ Windfalls Despite December’s market contraction, meme tokens like Pepe had their moments of glory. The third-largest memecoin by market capitalization received a boost from high-profile exchange listings, including Binance.US and Coinbase, which spurred temporary rallies. Notably, Binance.US added the token to its offerings on December 4, sending PEPE’s market cap soaring to over $11 billion and briefly outpacing Uniswap’s market cap. This surge provided lucrative opportunities for traders who bet early on Pepe. In one remarkable case from April, an investor turned a $3,000 purchase into a jaw-dropping $46 million in just one month, reflecting Pepe’s meteoric rise. December also saw the reawakening of a dormant wallet holding Pepe. The trader, who had invested a mere $27 in the token over 600 days ago, transferred approximately $52 million worth of Pepe tokens to a new address. This transaction represented an astonishing 1.9 million-fold return on investment, underscoring the high-stakes potential of the memecoin market. As the memecoin craze cools, analysts speculate that the sharp fluctuations in demand and market cap may deter cautious investors while continuing to attract those seeking quick, high-risk rewards. Whether memecoins regain their momentum in the new year remains an open question.

However, while major coins have largely stagnated, the usual Santa Claus rally had several small caps shining. aixbt by Virtuals (AIXBT), Phala (PHALA) and Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) outpaced most coins. Meanwhile, AI agent token iDEGEN (IDGN) stormed to over $10 million in pre-market auction and could see its price explode when it goes live on trading platforms on January 1. That’s just three days out. Here’s the price outlook for AIXBT and iDEGEN. Aixbt price outlook One of the new crypto sector attractions is AI agent tokens. aixbt by Virtuals (AIXBT) such a token. It’s an AI agent and crypto platform whose native token allows holders to leverage narrative detection and alpha analysis to track and interpret markets. AIXBT uses AI to automate this process, bringing users real-time actionable insights. The AIXBT token has jumped more than 30% in the past 24 hours. Notably, its price has shot up 1,882% since trading at lows of $0.02381 on November 19, 2024. Given predictions for cryptocurrencies in the coming months, with AI agent tokens a hot trend, AIXBT could target a new all-time high. The token just reached the ATH of $0.48 and the next target will be $1. But could iDEGEN outpace this Virtuals Protocol ecosystem token? iDEGEN price prediction iDEGEN is another AI agent token that has created waves since its launch in late Nov. The unique aspect of this project is its design that allowed a blank slate AI to get degen-trained, completely without the guardrails that have encumbered other AI agents and traditional AI-powered crypto. iDEGEN thus owes everything it has learned and posts every 60 minutes to degen knowledge on X. Integration with Telegram has only fuelled interest, with the token IDGN attracting the broader crypto investor community. Keen to exploit the dynamic pricing model, early buyers have poured over $10 million into the iDEGEN presale. As noted, price follows a dynamic pricing model. In this case, it rises or falls depending on what happens in a five-minute interval. It’s what has pushed IDGN’s price up by 277% in the past week and a staggering 101,700% since its debut just over a month ago. The current price is $0.118 – likely a bargain if AI agents go parabolic. Presale market data shows traders have scooped over 1.12 billion IDGN so far. With listing on crypto exchange platforms coming on January 1, the price level to watch may be the coveted $1. Learn more about iDEGEN or how to buy the AI agent token here .

From Toncoin’s resilience amid bearish momentum to Sui’s remarkable recent growth and innovative ideas of Remittix in the $190 trillion cross-border payments industry, each of these initiatives is creating waves. Which of these top crypto coins, though, is most likely to see an exponential increase in 2025? Promising technical signs, positive community attitude, and game-changing ideas all point to large possible rewards. Read on to learn why these top crypto coins might be the next big thing and what distinguishes every one of them from the others. Toncoin (TON): A Strong Contender Among Top Altcoins for 2025 Though it has been consolidating between $5.14 and $6.14, the Toncoin price has demonstrated a clear rise over the past week of more than 7%. This Toncoin price movement points to a time of stability within the oscillations of the larger market. On a monthly analysis of the Toncoin price chart, nevertheless, a bearish trend shows as the value of the altcoin dropped by more than 10% last month. Notwithstanding these swings, the Toncoin community’s general attitude is still quite positive since many investors see great future possibilities for the altcoin. Renowned analyst Ali has underlined that Toncoin could be about to have a notable comeback given the present funding rates, hence it is one of the promising altcoins to watch. The Toncoin price chart technically is giving conflicting indications. TradingView reports that although the Momentum Oscillator suggests a cautious view with sale indications, both the MACD and Moving Averages point to purchase signals . For investors seeking long-term gains, Toncoin is still among the top altcoins to hold even if it is about 30% away from its all-time high (ATH) of $8.24. Bullish Sentiment Builds For Sui (SUI) Amid Consolidation The Sui price had a notable drop of more than 9% over the past week, having shown notable consolidation between $4.94 and $4.05. After the Sui coin hit a new all-time high (ATH) on December 16, 2024, investor attention stayed strong despite this brief retreat. But as bearish market pressure has pulled down the Sui price from that top by almost 16%, some holders are already buying the dips. Meanwhile, the Sui price chart for the past month presents a far more optimistic picture with a strong trend with an amazing 20% growth in value. Notwithstanding these swings, the general attitude of the community about the Sui coin is still very bullish. Technically, the Sui price chart is pointing to possible investing prospects. Both the Momentum Oscillator and Moving Averages show purchase signs , implying further rallies for the altcoin. With its recent performance and bullish sentiment, Sui is fast rising among the promising altcoins to watch. Analyst Mags has also shown optimism, saying SUI might rally to a minimum of $40 in this cycle. Remittix (RTX) Is Enhancing Cross-Border Payments By deftly combining cryptocurrencies with conventional currency systems, Remittix is transforming the way people and companies engage with worldwide payments. Providing a quick, safe, and straightforward solution, Remittix lets customers send and get money straight to bank accounts using over thirty recognized currencies.

This creative solution provides unequalled efficiency and convenience, therefore changing our perspective on global transfers. Remittix’s innovative ecosystem revolves around its native token, RTX, which is presently in presale and sells for just $0.0163. Remittix is positioned to profit from the expanding industry as worldwide demand for flawless, cross-border payment solutions rises; so, the RTX token has great potential investment value. Analysts predict a stunning 500% rise in value before the presale ends, hence right now is the ideal moment for investors to join the presale. Remittix is positioned to lead the fast-growing PayFi market with its emphasis on enhancing the speed and simplicity of international transactions, making it the best crypto investment of the year. Remittix (RTX) Is Set To Outpace Toncoin (TON) and Sui (SUI) Although Toncoin (TON) and Sui (SUI) have great promise in 2025, Remittix (RTX) is the best crypto investment choice for smart investors wishing to profit in the direction of cross-border transactions. Remittix is prepared to transform the way the world manages worldwide transactions by deftly combining cryptocurrencies with conventional financial institutions. Moreover, the ongoing presale provides RTX tokens at just $0.0163. Remittix is positioned to dominate the PayFi market and is predicted to generate a 500% return on investment before the presale finishes as worldwide demand for quick, low-cost, open payment solutions increases.

This shows a steady increase in sustainable energy adoption since April 2021. Woocharts calculates this metric using the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance's definition of sustainability and takes into account energy sources such as wind, solar, hydro, and nuclear power. Exceeding 50% clean energy usage is a milestone. Tesla, which has 11,509 BTC as of the third quarter of 2024, first adopted Bitcoin as a payment method after purchasing $1.5 billion worth of the cryptocurrency in 2021. However, the company later suspended Bitcoin payments, citing concerns about the cryptocurrency’s high energy consumption. Related News: Former CFTC Chairman Chris Giancarlo Speaks About Bitcoin and Ethereum Tesla CEO Elon Musk has stated that the company will reconsider Bitcoin payments if mining operations reach around 50% clean energy usage: “Tesla only sold ~10% of assets to confirm that BTC can be easily liquidated without moving the market. Once the future positive trend of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners is confirmed, Tesla will continue to allow Bitcoin transactions.” Now all eyes are on Elon Musk's announcement of whether his company will accept Bitcoin. *This is not investment advice.

This has left investors frustrated as the altcoin struggles to gain upward momentum. This extended inactivity has taken a toll on traders’ confidence, with many stepping back as the altcoin has failed to display significant price growth. XRP Open Interest Drops By $1B Recently, the Open Interest in XRP Futures dropped by a massive $1 billion in the past 24 hours. Just a day before, the Open Interest had surged to $2.9 billion over expectations of a rally. However, as the expectations of an imminent rally faded away, traders began withdrawing their funds. This sudden withdrawal reflects the growing bearish sentiment among the XRP enthusiasts. Also, the declining Open Interest depicts the growing uncertainty over XRP’s ability to break through its current resistance levels. Adding to these concerns, is XRP’s macro momentum as well which is showing signs of weakness. XRP To Remain Stagnant? The Price DAA Divergence is currently flashing a sell signal, indicating declining participation and stagnant price movements. This bearish indicator suggests that traders may begin to secure profits, which could lead to further drawdown in the price. The reduced participation from the investors could hold obstruct the altcoin’s recovery, keeping it stuck in a consolidation phase until stronger market signals emerge. While XRP’s price has dropped by 20% over the past month, but it has managed to hold above the $2.00 support level. However, it still remains under the crucial resistance level of $2.73. XRP could continue declining and could risk losing its $2.00 support level if the bearish factors continue to exist. This could further weaken investor confidence and add to the selling pressure aggravting the situation. Analysts Bullish On XRP On the contrary, if the broader market conditions appear bullish, XRP could breach the $2.73 resistance and aim for its all-time high of $3.31. Analysts are bullish on XRP’s future as recently, analyst Dark Defender took to X to share that XRP is currently in a correction phase, similar to a 4-hour time frame, which is expected to complete within ±10 days on the daily chart. He noted that a bull flag pattern was identified on the weekly chart in early December, with a target of $8.67. However, the analyst notes that before reaching this target, XRP must complete its correction. He quotes the support levels to be $2.03, $2.11, $2.13, and $2.17, while resistance levels are $2.22, $2.42, and $2.69. The analyst believes that XRP is expected to continue targets very soon after completing the correction. Crypto analyst Egrag has forecasted that May 5th could be a crucial date for XRP, expressing a bullish outlook with a target of $15 for XRP by May 5th, 2025.",News|Altcoins|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-29 11:33:25

The Latin American nation’s buy of an additional 1 BTC on Dec. 29, its total reserves have risen to 6,000.77 BTC, worth $569.3 million. Its listing now joins the roster of top Bitcoin-holding countries such as the United States, China, the United Kingdom, Ukraine, and Bhutan. Great Returns on Investment El Salvador’s Bitcoin journey began in September 2021, when it became the first country to adopt BTC as legal tender. Its first purchase of 200 BTC at the time set the stage for a series of consistent investments under President Nayib Bukele’s administration. To date, the country has seen an impressive 108.02% return on its Bitcoin holdings, with an average acquisition cost of $45,450 per BTC. IMF Deal Spurs Faster Buying If the continued tension with the International Monetary Fund over its Bitcoin policies is any indication, it would appear that El Salvador has continued to double down on its crypto strategy. A $1.4 billion financing agreement with the IMF didn’t stop the country from buying $1 million worth of BTC on one day. The government could accelerate its rate of Bitcoin purchases going forward. Chivo Wallet to Be Retired El Salvador’s Chivo wallet, launched as a government-backed cryptocurrency wallet, is reportedly going to be either sold or phased out, said Herbert. Private sector wallets are expected to fill the gap, which will continue to provide support for BTC transactions in the country. Challenges Ahead and Opportunities While important, the IMF deal is not final and marks the end of four years of hard-won negotiations. The IMF has cautioned that Bitcoin is a risk to El Salvador’s financial stability and has leaned on the country to scale back its crypto ambitions. But El Salvador remains all-in on its BTC game, believing the cryptocurrency a core asset in its future finances. With its new BTC milestone, El Salvador cements its position as a world leader in cryptocurrency adoption, powering through the opportunities and challenges toward its vision of a Bitcoin-centered economic strategy.",Blockchain|Bitcoin|Cryptocurrency|Regulation,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|REGULATION,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2024-12-29 11:34:13

Notably, Brandt shared a weekly chart that shows a bullish wedge pattern. If validated, the pattern will show price growth into 2025. However, the daily chart suggests a correction from the local top level of $2.728000. Here are two views of $XRPUSD a weekly chart and a daily chart Strong opinions, weakly held A chart is not an opinion and an opinion is not necessarily a position – this is a concept hard to understand by rookies pic.twitter.com/SvaT5hojLW — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 27, 2024 Previously, Peter Brandt had shared that the XRP/USD pair currently seems to be forming a Half Mast Flag. If this pattern completes, Brandt had suggested that the “distance to upside should equal advance into tip of flag.” He noted that that the potential upside could match the previous advance into the tip of the flag, as is typical for this formation. While it often signals a significant price move after a drop, it does not always ensure upward momentum. Credible Crypto’s Bullish Insights Recently, Credible Crypto, a crypto analyst and trader in a latest Youtube video shared that XRP has one of the most bullish market structures in crypto based on the charts. XRP is one of the few coins right now that is printing a very clear bullish impulsive structure on lower time frames, on higher time frames, on every time frame. And very easily cleanly identifiable,” he noted. “That’s kind of what we’re seeing here on XRP – is that very clean price action that shows impulsive price movement,” he added further. The analyst regularly applies the Elliott Wave theory in his technical analysis, and has noted that XRP could explode by up to 1,295% from the current level. Notably, in technical analysis, the Elliott Wave theory suggests that a bullish asset witnesses a five-wave rally before a correction occurs in a three-wave pattern. Credible believes that XRP is preparing for an upward impulse, potentially reaching $4+ and new all-time highs. He suggests this could be part of a larger third-wave move that may ultimately push XRP to $5+. As the final fifth wave progresses, Credible anticipates XRP could reach a blow-off top of $20 to $30. XRP To Hit Double Digits? “By the time we’re gearing up for this final fifth wave, I would imagine that we would have hit double digits at that point. And this fifth wave will take us to the blow-off top or the final top of $20 to $30,” he noted. Notably, XRP witnessed a notable rally in December as it reached a peak of $2.72 on December 3. However, the XRP price has declined steadily due to increased volatility this holiday season. While a brief rally followed the launch of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin but it was not enough to take XRP to newer heights. XRP is currently 36.3% below its all-time high from early 2018, failing to set a new record in December despite earlier momentum. Nevertheless, the fully diluted valuation (FDV) has climbed to $216.24 billion, reinforcing confidence in XRP’s long-term potential.",News|Altcoins|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|ZRX,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-29 11:37:49

He is pushing for a significant change to a membership-based organization (MBO) to address ongoing challenges within the ecosystem. Hoskinson’s main issue with the foundation is its non-membership governance model , which he claims undermines community participation and oversight. This lack of community involvement, according to him, has created tensions and hindered the blockchain's growth. On December 28, he reiterated these concerns, suggesting an MBO would give users more control over decision-making and solve long-standing issues like social coordination, advocacy for developers, liquidity , and exchange listings. He believes a transition to an MBO would bring practical benefits, such as better oversight of payments and creating a unified entity for development contracts. “The organization should be an MBO. It would solve so many issues people have been complaining about for years,” Hoskinson stated. Earlier this month, he also urged the foundation to move to a jurisdiction where community members could elect its board, opposing the current model in which the Swiss government appoints board members, excluding the Cardano community. Hoskinson’s frustrations extend to resource management. He has highlighted Intersect, a community-led initiative, as a promising alternative but noted its limited funding and reliance on volunteers . Unlike the foundation, which has significant resources, Intersect faces an uphill battle to meet community expectations. Additionally, Hoskinson criticized the foundation for launching Pragma, another entity, instead of supporting Intersect or other community initiatives. He emphasized that the foundation should prioritize empowering existing community-led projects rather than creating competing organizations. This dispute adds to a series of disagreements between Hoskinson and the foundation, including budget allocation and differing opinions on the newly proposed Cardano constitution. While the foundation has expressed support for the constitution, it has hesitated to approve budgets, citing a need for detailed reviews. Hoskinson remains firm that an MBO is essential for the ecosystem's long-term success . He stated that if the foundation cannot adopt this model, it should at least refrain from obstructing community-driven efforts to create one. “If they don’t want to do that, then at least don’t get in the way of Intersect and the budget for the community to build one themselves,” he concluded.",,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-29 11:45:17
38265201,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53378,1735473044,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Top 3 Coins You Should Monitor Closely If You Like Dogecoin (DOGE),https://timestabloid.com/top-3-coins-you-should-monitor-closely-if-you-like-dogecoin-doge/,"With its humorous origins, community-driven expansion, and ability to carve out a niche in the cryptocurrency market, Dogecoin (DOGE) has captivated the crypto space. Many other coins are becoming popular for those who value DOGE’s appeal and possibilities, as they combine community spirit with different uses. Among them are must-watch tokens Rexas Finance (RXS), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Pepe (PEPE), which offer creativity, interaction, and the chance for big rewards. Rising Star: Rexas Finance (RXS). One innovative concept that combines accessibility and creativity is Rexas Finance. Unlike many meme-based coins, Rexas Finance focuses on Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization, offering actual value. By allowing fractional ownership of classic assets, including real estate, commodities, and collectibles, Rexas Finance democratizes investment possibilities and closes the distance between blockchain and traditional finance. Priced at $0.15 now in Stage 10 of its presale, RXS is likely to rise to $0.175 in the next stage. Rexas Finance has now raised an amazing $32,811,794 after 99.45% of the presale aim was met, and over 377 million tokens were sold. The success of the presale shows how strongly investors believe the idea has a bright future.Thanks to important characteristics such as the Rexas Token Builder for asset tokenization, the Rexas Launchpad for safe fundraising, and Rexas GenAI for AI-driven NFT creation, Rexas Finance is more than simply another cryptocurrency initiative. Among DOGE-inspired investors, RXS distinguishes itself with its large ecosystem and CertiK-audited security, which guarantees its position for long-term development. Shiba Inu (SHIB): An Expanding Ecosystem Meme Coin Shiba Inu has demonstrated qualities beyond mere DOGE competition. Priced around $0.00002109, SHIB is still a reasonable choice for anyone looking to join its growing ecosystem. Often called the “Shib Army,” the Shiba Inu community has driven the token’s appeal. Beyond its comic beginnings, SHIB has grown more valuable with tools like ShibaSwap, which allows for decentralized trading and staking. Moreover, the project’s periodical token burning is meant to raise scarcity and long-term value. Although SHIB’s enormous 589 trillion token circulating count seems daunting, its low price allows investors to gather large quantities, which attracts individuals motivated by DOGE’s community-driven approach. SHIB has great potential for expansion even as it develops its ecosystem. Pepe (PEPE), The Recently Popular Meme Pepe has become quickly known as a powerful meme coin because of its entertaining branding and general community acceptance. With a market value of $7.28 billion and trading at $0.00001731, PEPE is a reasonably priced and attractive substitute for investors seeking high growth potential. Pepe stands out for its active community and dedication to remaining culturally relevant in the meme coin market. Its meme coin roots are evident in its huge 420 trillion token circulation; nonetheless, its strong market activity and liquidity are demonstrated by its active trading volume of more than $2.24 billion. Although buzz and community still primarily drive PEPE, its market momentum and rising popularity make it a coin worth monitoring. PEPE will most likely appeal to investors enthralled by DOGE’s lively character in their portfolio. Why You Should Pay Attention to These Coins These three coins—Rexas Finance (RXS), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Pepe (PEPE)—offer different advantages for Dogecoin fans while preserving the community-driven energy that made DOGE popular. With its innovative real-world application and presale momentum, Rexas Finance distinguishes itself from other companies. It provides investors with a steady growth path supported by a strong ecosystem. As Shiba Inu’s ecosystem and community support continue to expand, it is positioned as a long-term rival in the cryptocurrency space. Though younger, Pepe positions itself in the meme coin market using its cultural appeal and great trading activity. Each token has unique qualities that fit the Dogecoin philosophy and offer a range of possible developments. Whether you are interested in meme culture, strong communities, or resilient ecosystems, these three currencies should be on your radar. Conclusion Finding tokens that balance community energy with utility becomes increasingly important as the cryptocurrency market develops. Combining unique use cases with the meme-driven appeal that has lately attracted the market, Rexas Finance, Shiba Inu, and Pepe create a triple threat. These three coins are worth monitoring for individuals who love DOGE and are searching for the next great opportunity.

According to the CEO, the company is expecting to face increased competition in the face of regulatory hurdles that will pose enough challenges for firms in the industry. He also expects rapid improvements in the artificial intelligence industry going into the new year. According to CNBC , the Google CEO and other top executives talked about plans for the new year, especially what it has in store for the new year. The 2025 strategy meeting was attended by all employees, with some of them attending virtually. According to Pichai, 2025 is a year where the stakes will be high, noting that there will be several disruptive moments in the year. Google CEO discusses plans for Gemini in 2025 Google CEO Sundar Pichai also talked about getting the maximum benefits from the technology, noting that they can use it to solve real user problems. “I think it’s really important we internalize the urgency of this moment and need to move faster as a company. The stakes are high. These are disruptive moments,” he said. Google has dominated the search engine business. However, generative AI has shaken things up, forcing the company to step up in the face of competition. OpenAI started to enjoy adoption in 2022, propelling the company to a $157 billion valuation, thanks to investors like Microsoft. The company also announced in July that it will launch its search engine soon. Google is also stepping up, especially with the launch of its AI model Gemini . The app provides users with many functions, especially access to the company’s chatbot. Pichai sees Gemini as the next big thing, because it is close to the half-billion mark, a milestone that 15 other Google apps have hit in the past. Pichai said Gemini is currently gaining momentum, noting that Google only needs to work hard to close the gap in 2025. “With the Gemini app, there is strong momentum, particularly over the last few months,” he said. “But we have some work to do in 2025 to close the gap and establish a leadership position there as well.” Similarly, he feels all of that will be possible if they can scale the Gemini app to help users in 2025. Pichai wants to focus on making better products During the meeting, Pichai showed the attendees a list of large language models, where Gemini 1.5 led others. The list also included OpenAI’s ChatGPT and others. He mentioned that he expects rivals to challenge them and vice versa. Pichai also said he feels the company will be state-of-the-art, but concedes that they might have to play catch-up at some point. He explained that the company needs to focus on making better products instead of being the first. “In history, you don’t always need to be first but you have to execute well and be the best in class as a product, I think that’s what 2025 is all about,” he said. During the question session, an employee asked about what the company intends to do to rival other platforms in the AI space. Pichai passed the question to DeepMind co-founder Demis Hassabis who said they had plans to turbocharge the Gemini app. He said the market has been warming up to it, noting that they have recorded an influx of users since it launched in February. He also added the products are supposed to evolve over the next two years. Another employee asked how the company intends to scale its AI products without charging consumers $200 a month like other platforms. Hassabis said the company is not prepared to charge extravagantly for subscriptions, noting that a $20 per month charge will be good value if consumers intend to use the Gemini service. However, he said that there are no plans for that yet.

Table of Contents Rexas Finance: The high ROI token The path to a 38x price rally Choosing Rexas Finance over Solana and XRP Conclusion In recent weeks, Solana (SOL) has demonstrated notable volatility. At $192.24 right now, the token has appreciated 5.38% during the past 24 hours, suggesting a temporary rebound. Nonetheless, a 25.04% drop in the last month shows Solana’s volatile price movement on a more significant time scale. Ripple (XRP) has shown an incredible recovery, with its price of about $2.25. XRP is rising by 3.10% over the previous 24 hours, which helps to explain an impressive 55.36% rise over the past month. Though these gains and swings abound, forget SOL and XRP; this coin will 38x your $350 investment into $13300 in 54 days. You might also like: Rexas Finance poised to be future of RWA tokenization: Fourth presale stage ends earlier than predicted Rexas Finance: The high ROI token Rexas Finance (RXS) presents a game-changing potential, while established coins like Solana and Ripple fight market trends and investor mood. Just $0.175 during its presale stage 11, Rexas Finance has shown incredible speed. With almost $33.29 million raised to date and a 6x increase over its presale price, the cryptocurrency shows great investor trust. Analysts say Rexas Finance will provide an amazing 38x return in 54 days, transforming a $350 investment into $13,300. By bridging the digital and physical worlds, Rexas Finance helps consumers effortlessly tokenize real-world assets. Without technological knowledge, its ecosystem lets people and companies build tokenized representations of physical objects, including real estate, art, and goods. Tools like the Rexas Token Builder and the Rexas Launchpad simplify asset tokenization and make it globally accessible. With unmatched utility and scalability, this creative solution makes Rexas Finance a major participant in the fast-expanding real-world asset (RWA) tokenizing industry. The Certik audit of Rexas Finance gives the project a notable degree of credibility and trust. Renowned blockchain security company Certik has a certificate of certification that ensures investors are aware of the dependability and safety of Rexas Finance’s ecosystem. This audit distinguishes Rexas Finance in a market where security issues typically discourage potential investors by confirming its reputation as a reliable and safe platform. Based on its $1 million giveaway program, Rexas Finance has attracted a rapidly expanding following. With around 643,000 entries so far, the campaign is paying 20 winners $50,000 worth of RXS apiece, significantly increasing the token’s awareness and attractiveness. This program emphasizes the project’s kindness and dedication to creating a devoted and involved user base. The path to a 38x price rally Rexas Finance’s unique value proposition, strong ecosystem, and general investor excitement support its exponential development potential. One of the most profitable investment prospects in the present market, analysts estimate the token might cause a 38x price surge in only 54 days. For early adopters, a $350 investment in Rexas Finance, currently at $0.175, may turn into $13,300 in life-changing profits. The coin’s strong presale performance and capacity to meet real-world needs through creative tokenization solutions support this amazing prognosis. Choosing Rexas Finance over Solana and XRP Although Solana and XRP are now somewhat well-known in the crypto scene, their development potential is less than Rexas Finance’s. Solana’s volatile pricing patterns and XRP’s reliance on legal successes make them less consistent investing choices. Driven by its creative approach to real-world asset tokenizing and expanding its community of supporters, Rexas Finance has a clear road map for exponential development. Moreover, Rexas Finance’s reasonable presale price of $0.175 provides a reasonable starting point for investors trying to optimize their gains. Its ability to produce a 38x rise in just 54 days distinguishes it as a high-reward possibility in the current market environment. Conclusion Rexas Finance offers an unmatched opportunity for investors looking to profit from the next big thing in the crypto market. Priced at $0.175 and expected to yield a 38x return in 54 days, the token can turn small investments into enormous riches. Rexas Finance is positioned to challenge the crypto market with its creative approach to real-world asset tokenization, outstanding presale performance, Certik-audited security, and active community involvement.

The retracement reflects broader market uncertainties and profit-taking by investors following its impressive rally. However, recent on-chain metrics point to an intriguing shift in market dynamics: a surge in whale accumulation. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Bought Over 90 Million DOGE In 48H – Details Top analyst Ali Martinez highlighted key data revealing that major investors have purchased over 20 million ADA in the past 48 hours. This significant activity adds to an ongoing trend of large-scale accumulation by whales, signaling growing confidence in Cardano’s long-term potential. The renewed interest from big players comes as Cardano continues to expand its ecosystem with robust development initiatives and partnerships. This accumulation phase could mark a turning point for ADA, as whale activity often precedes market recoveries and future price rallies. While the market remains cautious, Cardano’s underlying metrics suggest resilience despite the recent downturn. Investors and analysts are now closely watching these developments to gauge whether this accumulation trend will help ADA regain momentum and climb back toward its previous highs. With whale interest intensifying, Cardano could be gearing up for a notable rebound in the coming weeks. Cardano Whales Keep Buying Cardano’s recent price correction has not deterred long-term investors, particularly whales, who seem to be seizing the opportunity to accumulate. This sharp uptick in accumulation suggests that large-scale investors are positioning themselves for a potential price breakout in the near future. Historically, significant whale activity has often preceded major market moves, and this case appears no different. The accumulation trend highlights growing confidence among influential players in Cardano’s ecosystem, even as the market has seen recent turbulence. Analysts speculate that whales could be anticipating upcoming developments or improvements within the Cardano blockchain that may fuel renewed interest and price growth. This trend aligns with broader market dynamics, where smart money often takes advantage of suppressed prices to establish positions before momentum shifts. As a result, the activity of these large holders is being closely monitored by market participants who view it as a critical indicator of ADA’s potential direction. Related Reading: A 20%-30% Correction Is ‘The Most Bullish Thing’ That Could Happen To Bitcoin – Analyst While short-term fluctuations persist, the underlying metrics paint a bullish picture for Cardano. If whale accumulation continues, it could serve as a catalyst for ADA to reclaim key resistance levels and potentially break out of its prolonged correction phase. ADA Holding Key Levels Cardano is currently trading above the $0.85 support level despite growing selling pressure in recent sessions. This key level has acted as a critical demand zone, preventing further declines and providing a foundation for potential recovery. However, ADA remains at a crossroads, as its next moves could set the tone for its price trajectory in the coming weeks. If Cardano can reclaim the psychologically significant $1 mark with conviction, analysts predict a strong rally could follow. Such a move would likely pave the way for ADA to challenge its yearly high at $1.32, set during its impressive run in early December. Breaking above this resistance could signal a broader market reversal and renew bullish momentum for the cryptocurrency. However, risks still loom on the downside. Failure to hold current support levels could expose ADA to a deeper retracement, potentially revisiting lower demand zones around $0.75. This scenario would reflect increased bearish sentiment, highlighting the ongoing battle between bulls and bears.

With whale accumulation trends and solid on-chain fundamentals providing support, ADA remains poised for significant volatility in the days ahead.

This platform allows strategic investors to access varied assets such as stocks, forex, and ETFs to realize more rewarding investment returns than simply trading cryptocurrencies. Now is the time for wise investors to evaluate this exciting opportunity, given the increasing momentum around the DTX Exchange presale, which is currently selling at an affordable $0.14 per DTX token but is expected to hit $0.16 by the next phase. Revolutionizing Crypto Trading with Integrated Stocks, Forex, and Tokenized ETFs for a Seamless Investment Experience DTX Exchange is a first-mover crypto-native platform that integrates different options for trading all under a single roof. Unlike the conventional exchanges that solely deal with cryptocurrencies, DTX merges stocks, forex, and over 100,000 currency pairs into its system, creating a platform for trading shares and currencies. The idea is to expand investment options and improve user interaction by eliminating multiple platforms. Therefore, the upcoming launch of tokenized ETFs on the DTX Exchange must be followed. These ETFs will target users from countries where trading in conventional ETFs is limited, an idea that opens up a larger market (of customers). Consequently, individual and corporate investors seeking regulated channels to deal with online assets are expected to find such features appealing. DTX is determined to satisfy market needs and attract more clients by integrating this new trading opportunity. DTX has earned an impressive cash flow totaling $10.6 million during an ongoing presale phase. The interest for this is exceptionally high, given that over 300 thousand wallets are now operational. The starting point for the price was $0.02 per token when it was first launched, and it is expected to get to $0.16 in no time. The prospect of a large gain has caused investors to become excited in particular. According to analysts, DTX is expected to have an astonishing 100 times upsurge upon becoming listed at significant cryptocurrency exchanges only after launch. This hope comes from the VulcanX blockchain technology, which has an advanced technology environment that ensures there are no delays during transactions with speeds reaching up to one hundred thousand per second (TPS). This suggests that DTX Exchange can compete with all others within this sector based on its profitability and performance efficiencies. Pioneering User-Centered Innovations with High Leverage, Community-Driven Features, and Enhanced Asset Security What sets DTX Exchange apart from its rivals is a set of user-centered functionalities targeted at increasing security and gains. Users are granted access to trade using up to 1,000x leverage, a move that makes it possible for even small amounts of money to be traded with great ease through them, hence turning a $100 investment into $100,000 trading power. Besides, the DTX token holders who vote can control what new products and functions come up on the site. This fosters engagement with the community and makes sure clients’ opinions matter in the way that the platform will evolve. Large-scale investors can also take advantage of such a program for profit sharing which would give them more reasons to put money into DTX tokens. This means that with its capability to securely hold any kind of assets traded through it, The Phoenix Wallet acts as another form of securing users’ control over their belongings hence enhancing safety standards for DTX. Conclusion On the horizon of 2025, DTX Exchange shines as an innovational beacon in cryptocurrency. With an imminent ETF trading platform launch and an ongoing presale that already boasts of significant investment, there is no better moment than now when one should think about stashing money into some DTXs. The combination of advanced technology, diverse asset offerings, and community-driven governance makes DTX Exchange an intriguing opportunity for new and seasoned investors.
