Not a few dollars, but potentially hundreds of millions. That’s the reality for James Howells, an IT professional from Wales, who accidentally discarded a hard drive containing thousands of Bitcoin years ago. His decade-long mission to recover this treasure from a landfill has become the stuff of legend in the crypto world, and now, this incredible saga is set to reach a global audience. Entertainment startup Lebul has officially acquired the rights to develop content based on Howells’ extraordinary story. This isn’t just a simple news report; Lebul plans a comprehensive project encompassing a docuseries, a podcast, and engaging social-first content. The goal is to dive deep into every aspect of this modern-day treasure hunt, blending the high-stakes world of blockchain technology with the very grounded, complex issues of environmental impact and human persistence. The Origin of the Lost Bitcoin Fortune The tale begins back in 2013. James Howells had been one of the early adopters of Bitcoin, mining thousands of coins on a Dell laptop. After spilling a drink on the laptop, he disassembled it and kept the hard drive, thinking he might recover data later. However, during a clear-out, the crucial hard drive – which held the private keys to access over 8,000 BTC – was mistakenly thrown away and ended up in the local landfill site in Newport, Wales. At the time, Bitcoin’s value was relatively low, and the loss didn’t seem catastrophic. But as BTC’s price soared over the following years, reaching tens of thousands of dollars per coin, the true magnitude of the loss became staggering. The 8,000+ BTC, at its peak valuation, represented a fortune exceeding $800 million, making it one of the most valuable instances of lost Bitcoin in history. Why is This Bitcoin Recovery Story So Compelling? Howells’ quest resonates with people for many reasons. It’s more than just a story about lost money; it touches upon universal themes: The Scale of the Loss: The sheer amount of value lost is almost unfathomable, capturing the imagination. Relatability: Everyone has lost something important, but losing hundreds of millions due to a simple mistake amplifies that feeling dramatically. Tech Meets Trash: A cutting-edge digital asset is lost in the most mundane, physical place – a landfill. The contrast is stark. Persistence Against Odds: Howells has spent a decade battling bureaucracy, skepticism, and logistical nightmares, showcasing incredible determination. The Environmental Dilemma: The potential environmental impact of digging up a massive landfill site adds a layer of complexity and debate to the mission. This mix of high finance, personal tragedy, technological mystery, and environmental concern makes the Bitcoin recovery story uniquely captivating. The Landfill Bitcoin Challenge: More Than Just Digging Recovering a hard drive from a landfill isn’t like finding a needle in a haystack; it’s like finding a specific grain of sand on a vast beach. The Newport landfill is enormous, receiving thousands of tons of waste annually. Howells’ hard drive could be buried under meters of garbage accumulated over the past decade. The challenges are immense: Logistics: Excavating the relevant section of the landfill requires heavy machinery, a large team, and sophisticated sorting technology. Cost: Howells has estimated the operation could cost millions of dollars, requiring significant investment and funding. Environmental Concerns: Disturbing the landfill could release harmful gases, contaminate soil and groundwater, and disrupt local ecosystems. The Newport City Council has repeatedly cited environmental risks as a primary reason for denying his requests for excavation permits. Technology: Howells’ recovery plans involve cutting-edge technology, including AI-powered sorting machines to identify potential hard drives among the waste and even robotic dogs for surveying the site. Regulatory Hurdles: Gaining permission from the local council and environmental agencies has been the biggest roadblock, highlighting the complex interplay between personal wealth, technological ambition, and public/environmental safety. Finding the specific hard drive is just the first step; there’s also the question of whether it’s still functional after years of exposure to the elements and pressure within the landfill. This uncertainty adds another layer of drama to the Landfill Bitcoin saga. Lebul’s Vision: A Crypto Documentary Like No Other Lebul’s acquisition of the rights signals a major effort to bring this story to a mainstream audience. Their multi-platform approach is designed to capture different facets of the narrative: The Docuseries: This will likely be the core of the project, providing a chronological narrative of Howells’ life, the loss, the realization of the value, and his relentless efforts to recover the drive. It can explore the technical aspects of Bitcoin, the environmental debate surrounding the landfill, and the human drama of pursuing such an unlikely goal. The Podcast: A podcast format allows for deeper dives into specific topics, interviews with experts (on blockchain, environmental science, landfill management), and perhaps even a week-by-week update if the recovery attempt ever gets underway. Social-First Content: Short, engaging clips and visuals tailored for social media platforms can help build buzz and explain complex ideas in an accessible way, reaching a younger, digitally-native audience interested in crypto and unique stories. By blending compelling storytelling with explanations of blockchain technology and discussions on environmental responsibility, Lebul aims to create a Crypto documentary that appeals beyond just the crypto community, drawing in viewers interested in true crime, environmental issues, or simply incredible human interest stories. What Does This Mean for James Howells Bitcoin? For James Howells, this development is a significant step. Having the rights acquired by an entertainment company like Lebul not only validates the dramatic potential of his story but also provides a platform to potentially gain wider support or even attract investors for his complex recovery operation. While the docuseries itself won’t recover the hard drive, the increased public awareness and potential funding could bring him closer to his goal. Howells has always maintained that if he succeeds, he plans to share a significant portion of the recovered fortune with the city of Newport, funding local projects and even an environmental cleanup of the landfill site. This proposed philanthropic element adds a layer of altruism to the pursuit of immense personal wealth, making the James Howells Bitcoin narrative even more intriguing. The Broader Lesson: Securing Your Crypto While Howells’ story is unique in its scale and location, the underlying issue of lost private keys is a significant one in the crypto world. Millions of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are estimated to be permanently lost due to misplaced hard drives, forgotten passwords, or lost seed phrases. Howells’ experience serves as a dramatic, albeit extreme, reminder of the importance of secure private key management and storage. Unlike traditional banks, there’s no customer service line to call when you lose access to your digital assets. Conclusion: A Modern Treasure Hunt Unfolds James Howells’ quest for his lost Bitcoin from a Welsh landfill is a modern-day treasure hunt unlike any other. It’s a story packed with immense value, technological hurdles, environmental debates, and the sheer willpower of one individual. Lebul’s commitment to developing a comprehensive content project around this saga ensures that this fascinating intersection of crypto, environment, and human drama will be explored in depth, offering audiences a captivating look at one of the most unique stories in the history of digital currency. As Lebul begins production, the world will be watching to see how this incredible Bitcoin recovery story is told.

The firm filed the preliminary prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on April 29. According to the filing , the shares will track BlackRock’s BLF Treasury Trust Fund (TTTXX), a $150 billion fund that invests mainly in US Treasury bills, notes, cash, and other obligations issued and guaranteed by the US Treasury. The firm stated that the shares will be sold through the Bank of New York (BNY) Mellon, with the bank keeping a mirror record of transactions and share ownership on the blockchain. However, it added that the fund does not currently use blockchain technology. The preliminary prospectus reads: “Although the Fund does not currently employ blockchain technology or invest in crypto assets, the Financial Intermediary through whom shareholders purchase and redeem DLT Shares intends to employ blockchain technology to maintain a mirror record of share ownership for its customers.” Unsurprisingly, the product is only available to institutional investors with a minimum investment of $3 million to participate. The firm has yet to propose a ticker for the DLT shares but specified that the management fee will be 0.18%. Tokenized treasuries already over $6 billion The move by BlackRock highlights the continued exploration of blockchain technologies by traditional financial institutions to launch new products. BlackRock is already a key participant in this sector with its tokenized US Treasury product, BUIDL, being the biggest tokenized treasury product. The firm is bullish on blockchain technology and tokenization with the chairman, Larry Fink, identifying the importance of tokenization in making financial products more accessible to investors. According to data from rwa.xyz , BUIDL, which is a product of Securitize and BlackRock, currently has $2.556 billion in assets under management (AUM) and has seen a net inflow of more than $600 million in the last 30 days. With only 70 holders, its performance captures the solid interest in tokenized products, especially from institutional investors in the decentralized finance sector. BlackRock BUIDL has seen the highest netflow in the last 30 days (Source: rwa.xyz) However, other tokenized treasury products are also attracting sizable interest, even if they are not growing on a similar level as BUIDL. Overall, the sector now has $6.16 billion in AUM from 44 products. The next product with the highest AUM after BUIDL is Franklin Templeton’s BENJI, with $706.77 million. Others, such as Superstate USTB, Ondo USDY, and OUSG, and Circle USYC, also have over $400 million in AUM each. Despite the growth of these products, many industry experts believe this is still an early stage, and the sector is primed for more growth. Standard Chartered experts predict that the tokenization market could be worth $30 trillion by 2030. BlackRock IBIT sees record inflows Meanwhile, BUIDL is not the only crypto-related product from BlackRock that has enjoyed a massively positive performance in recent times. The firm’s Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), IBIT, also recorded its second-largest daily inflow since launch, with $970.9 million on Monday. Its inflows on that day contrast with the outflows from competing products, such as Ark 21 Shares ARKB, Fidelity’s FBTC, and Bitwise’s BITB. However, IBIT’s performance was still enough to offset these outflows and ensure $591.2 million in net flow for Bitcoin ETFs. The product, which has over $50 billion in AUM, has pulled in more than $4.5 billion in inflows since April 22 and accounts for 51% of the value of all spot Bitcoin ETFs .

A substantial movement of Grayscale Ethereum has just occurred, signaling potential shifts in how large holders manage their assets. What Happened with the Grayscale Ethereum Wallet? According to data tracked by blockchain analytics platform Arkham, a specific crypto wallet identified as potentially linked to Grayscale initiated a significant transfer. Roughly an hour ago, this wallet moved 3,909 ETH to Coinbase Prime. At the time of the transfer, this amount of Ethereum was valued at approximately $6.95 million. Here’s a quick breakdown: Sender: Wallet potentially linked to Grayscale Recipient: Coinbase Prime Amount: 3,909 ETH Approximate Value: $6.95 million (at the time of transfer) Source: Arkham data Grayscale is one of the largest digital asset managers, known for its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE). Movements from wallets associated with such major players are always noteworthy as they can provide insights into institutional sentiment and strategy. Why Transfer to Coinbase Prime? The destination of the transfer is equally important. Coinbase Prime is Coinbase’s platform specifically designed for institutional clients. It offers advanced trading features, secure custody solutions, and prime brokerage services tailored for large-scale investors and corporations. Moving assets to Coinbase Prime could indicate several potential actions: Preparation for trading (buying or selling). Transferring assets for secure custody under Coinbase’s institutional-grade infrastructure. Internal restructuring or rebalancing of assets within Grayscale or an affiliated entity. Meeting redemption requests, although this is less common for ETH trusts compared to GBTC historically, it’s a possibility depending on the specific fund structure. The precise reason for this specific transfer isn’t immediately clear from the transaction data alone, adding a layer of mystery to the movement. Potential Impact on ETH Price Whenever a large amount of an asset like Ethereum moves, especially to an exchange platform like Coinbase Prime, market participants naturally wonder about the potential impact on its price. At the moment, the ETH price is trading around $1,750.16, reflecting a decrease of 2.65% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. A transfer of this size to an institutional trading platform *could* signal potential selling pressure if the intent is to offload assets onto the market. However, as mentioned, it could just as easily be a move for custody or internal management that has no immediate impact on market supply. It’s crucial not to jump to conclusions based on a single transaction. While a $6.95 million transfer is significant for an individual, it’s a relatively small amount compared to Ethereum’s overall market capitalization (which is in the billions). Nevertheless, tracking such large crypto wallet movements is a key part of understanding the broader flow of institutional crypto capital. Following Institutional Crypto Wallet Activity Tracking the on-chain movements of large players is a fascinating aspect of the crypto market. Platforms like Arkham, Etherscan, and others allow anyone to observe these transactions, providing transparency that isn’t always available in traditional finance. Key things to watch for after such a transfer include: Are the funds subsequently moved from Coinbase Prime to other wallets or exchanges? Is there a noticeable increase in ETH selling volume on Coinbase or Coinbase Prime? Are there follow-up transfers from other Grayscale-linked wallets? Does the market react significantly in the hours or days following the transfer? Understanding institutional crypto movements helps piece together the larger market narrative beyond just price charts. Conclusion: Keeping an Eye on Grayscale Ethereum The transfer of 3,909 ETH from a wallet associated with Grayscale to Coinbase Prime is a notable event in the institutional crypto space. While the exact purpose remains unconfirmed, it highlights how major asset managers are actively managing their digital holdings. Whether this move precedes trading activity or is purely for operational reasons, it serves as a reminder of the constant flow of capital within the Ethereum ecosystem and the increasing sophistication of institutional participation. Market participants will be watching closely for any subsequent movements or market reactions that might shed more light on the intent behind this significant transfer.

With massive ROI rumors flying around and new projects causing waves before even launching, early access has become the golden ticket. Projects like Fartcoin, Tutorial, Fwog, Moo Deng, Just a Chill Guy, WHY, and SPX6900 are heating up — but one feline coin, you-know-who, is clawing its way to the top. Meme coin madness isn’t just about fun branding anymore. It’s about innovation, scarcity, and timing. These coins are leveraging playful narratives, viral engagement, and community power to offer serious potential gains. And if recent history has taught anything, it’s this — those who pounce early tend to be the ones walking away with their bags full. Among all the chaos, whispers of a cat-themed coin — let’s just say it’s sleek, stealthy, and stirring a storm on Trollercat.com — are echoing through the crypto alleys. This article breaks down why meme coins like WHY, Fwog, and the inescapable Troller Cat are catching fire among analysts and crypto chasers alike. But before we dive in, let’s talk about why Troller Cat’s whitelist might just be the smartest click you’ll make all year. 1. Troller Cat ($TCAT) Whitelist: Your Ticket to Early Access Glory Troller Cat’s whitelist is closing in fast, and the countdown is very real. Those who sign up now will gain exclusive access to the upcoming presale launching on May 2nd, 2025, at 6 PM UTC. What does that mean for potential buyers? Simple. First dibs at what many in the space are calling 2025’s most anticipated meme coin launch. With talks of a 10,000% ROI swirling, missing this could be one of those tales you’ll tell in regret. Whitelist access grants users an edge in securing tokens at the lowest possible entry point before the masses pour in. It’s not just early — it’s strategic. The chance to lock in prices before the floodgates open often means those who whitelist see the highest upside when prices moon. With Trollercat.com buzzing and registrations surging, this whitelist isn’t just another form — it’s a financial strategy. Why Whitelisting Troller Cat May Be Your Smartest Move of 2025 There’s a reason crypto analysts and alpha groups are whispering about Troller Cat. The project is building serious momentum, but it’s the whitelist advantage that has tongues wagging. Early participants won’t just get a head start; they may also unlock access to future staking rewards, rumored to be highly generous to those entering at the ground floor. Even better? Rumors suggest a play-to-earn Game Center could soon launch under the Troller Cat banner, adding a deflationary twist to the coin’s design. Translation: Token supply shrinks while demand spikes — classic economics that could fuel rapid price increases. This isn’t just a coin; it’s an ecosystem in the making. And whitelisting now? It’s like holding the backstage pass to the biggest meme coin concert of 2025. 2. WHY ($WHY): The Meme Coin with a Message WHY isn’t just a meme coin — it’s a bold philosophical question wrapped in crypto flair. With its simple name and profound undertones, WHY has sparked curiosity across social media, helping it achieve viral traction in the memecoin universe. It doesn’t rely solely on gimmicks; instead, WHY invites its holders to ponder bigger meanings while participating in a thriving decentralized economy. The token’s branding aligns well with modern internet culture — edgy, minimalist, and self-aware. As influencers and content creators increasingly latch onto meme tokens with depth and irony, WHY finds itself in a sweet spot between satire and substance. Its ongoing roadmap teases interactive tools and community challenges designed to keep users engaged. 3. Tutorial ($TUT): The Learn-to-Earn Meme Marvel Tutorial might sound like a crypto course, but it’s a meme coin project that flips the script on traditional education models. Designed to integrate learning and earning, Tutorial gamifies crypto knowledge, making it particularly popular with newer investors seeking both fun and fundamentals. The coin is buzzing in online communities thanks to its user-centric approach. With rumors swirling about potential integrations with decentralized learning platforms and quirky in-app features, Tutorial’s trajectory could surprise even seasoned traders. The playful name, paired with its instructional twist, is a smart branding move that caters to Gen Z and Gen Alpha. 4. Fwog ($FWOG): Froggy Frenzy in the Memeverse Fwog is leaping into the meme coin scene with a splash of nostalgia and a quirky amphibious twist. Drawing inspiration from internet frog memes and vintage web culture, Fwog has charmed the crypto crowd with its ribbiting personality. It’s community-focused and consistently hosts quirky giveaways and frog-themed events, making it one of the most engaging tokens in 2025. Fwog isn’t just hopping on trends — it’s carving a unique lane with speculative utility in gaming and digital collectibles. Analysts are closely watching as this frog-themed favorite begins to gain traction with both memecoin veterans and newcomers. 5. Just a Chill Guy ($CHILLGUY): Laid-back Lambo Dreams Just a Chill Guy embraces the chill vibe of internet culture. Unlike the typical hype-driven coin, this project plays it cool — literally. With branding centered around zen memes, cozy aesthetics, and good vibes, Just a Chill Guy has cultivated a loyal fan base that prefers the slow-and-steady approach to meme creation. This meme coin is rumored to explore relaxation-based metaverse hubs and passive income utilities that match its calm branding. Think of it as a digital hammock for those tired of market chaos. That relaxed angle makes it highly shareable and trend-worthy on platforms like Reddit and TikTok. 6. SPX6900 ($SPX): Bull Market Energy in Token Form SPX6900 is the meme coin for the traders who live and breathe charts. Named in reference to the S&P 500 hitting astronomical levels, this token celebrates the bullish spirit of the market. With chart memes, laser eyes, and peak speculation energy, SPX6900 gives meme traders a reason to cheer every green candle. The token’s high-octane branding connects strongly with financial meme culture — think stonks, diamond hands, and moon missions. Backed by meme-savvy devs and community mods who pump out relentless memes, it’s no surprise SPX6900 has rocketed into trending territories. 7. Moo Deng ($MOODENG): The Meme Cow Goes Crypto Moo Deng is a hilarious, bovine-themed meme coin that milks humor for all it’s worth. With moo memes galore and a decentralized farmer vibe, this token grazes the fields of virality. Its unique name and marketing have helped it surpass the competition and draw in meme coin ranchers from across the web. From cow-themed NFT drops to moo-sical collaborations, Moo Deng’s roadmap is as wild as its community. The coin has gained traction, particularly in regions where meme culture and agriculture intersect, creating a unique fusion of offline and online appeal. 8. Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN): Comedy Gold on the Blockchain If there’s one coin that isn’t afraid to go full send on toilet humor, it’s Fartcoin. Fueled by flatulence and fueled by fun, Fartcoin is the kind of project that doesn’t take itself too seriously — and that’s precisely why it’s becoming a fan favorite. This gas-powered meme token has taken over social media with its crude but catchy branding. Fartcoin memes, NFTs, and lowbrow humor are lighting up the crypto corners of the internet, and the community is anything but silent (pun intended). Despite the laughs, Fartcoin’s devs are surprisingly serious about keeping the tokenomics tight. Conclusion Based on the latest research, Troller Cat whitelist coins are Troller Cat, WHY, Tutorial, Fwog, Just a Chill Guy, SPX6900, Moo Deng, and Fartcoin. Each brings its flavor of madness to the crypto space, but one name is clawing its way ahead of the pack — Troller Cat. With its whitelist phase ending soon and a presale on the horizon, Trollercat.com offers a rare opportunity for ground-floor entry. The rumors around deflationary mechanics, sky-high staking returns, and a 10,000% ROI are just the beginning. Missing this could be like ignoring Bitcoin at $1.

This move has sparked considerable discussion, particularly within the tech and labor sectors, raising questions about the future of work alongside technological innovation. Let’s delve into how Duolingo AI is reshaping its platform and the subsequent reactions. Duolingo Embraces Generative AI for Massive Expansion Duolingo recently unveiled a staggering launch: 148 new language courses. This announcement, made on Wednesday, signifies a monumental expansion, effectively doubling the company’s existing course catalog. What’s truly remarkable is the speed at which this was achieved. According to Duolingo co-founder and CEO Luis von Ahn, creating the first 100 courses took approximately 12 years. In stark contrast, nearly 150 new courses were developed and launched in about a year, thanks largely to the integration of generative AI . Von Ahn highlighted this rapid scaling as a direct benefit of their investment in AI and automation, stating it allows them to scale at “unprecedented speed and quality.” This acceleration in content creation is a key outcome Duolingo is touting from its AI-first strategy. The Controversial Side: Duolingo Contractors and AI While the launch of numerous new courses is a positive for learners seeking more language options, the timing coincides with significant backlash Duolingo is facing. The controversy stems from the company’s stated intention to replace human contractors with AI for certain tasks. An internal email from CEO Luis von Ahn revealed plans to “gradually stop using contractors to do work that AI can handle” and that future hiring would be contingent on teams being unable to automate their work further. This shift towards becoming an “AI-first” company, as described by Von Ahn, is presented internally as a necessity for scaling content creation to meet global demand. He argued that manual content creation “doesn’t scale” and that AI is crucial for getting content to learners faster. However, this perspective has been met with considerable criticism externally. What Does This Mean for AI Language Courses and Quality? The rapid development of AI language courses raises questions about quality and accuracy. In the past, building a single Duolingo course was a multi-year effort involving language experts and educators. Now, generative AI is playing a central role in the content creation process. Duolingo asserts that its AI and automation investments allow for both speed and quality, but some users remain skeptical. The backlash on social media isn’t solely about job displacement; it also includes user concerns about the quality of AI-generated content. Some users have reported encountering inaccuracies or lower-quality content they attribute to the increased use of AI within the app. These concerns highlight an ongoing debate in the AI space: balancing the efficiency and scalability offered by AI with the nuances and quality often associated with human expertise, particularly in fields like education and language. The Impact of AI Content Creation The situation at Duolingo serves as a prominent example of the disruptive potential of AI content creation . The ability to generate educational material at an unprecedented pace could democratize access to learning, offering courses in languages that were previously too costly or time-consuming to develop manually. The 148 new courses, primarily aimed at beginner levels, include features like Stories and DuoRadio, designed to enhance reading and listening comprehension. However, this efficiency comes with significant implications for the human workforce, specifically the contractors who previously performed tasks now being automated. The narrative from Duolingo focuses on the benefits for learners and the mission of making language learning accessible, while the reaction from users and the public often centers on the human cost and potential impact on content quality. Looking Ahead: More Advanced AI-Powered Content? Duolingo plans to continue leveraging AI for future content development. While the initial wave of 148 courses focuses on beginner levels, the company intends to launch more advanced content in the coming months. This suggests a deeper integration of AI across the platform, potentially impacting how lessons are structured, personalized, and delivered. The company’s commitment to being “AI-first” indicates that artificial intelligence will play an increasingly central role in all aspects of its operations, from content creation to potentially user interaction and personalized learning paths. The success of this strategy will likely depend on Duolingo’s ability to maintain high content quality, address user concerns about AI-generated errors, and navigate the complex social and ethical implications of automating roles previously held by humans. Summary: A Double-Edged Sword? Duolingo’s massive launch of 148 AI language courses demonstrates the immense potential of generative AI to accelerate content creation and scale educational offerings rapidly. This aligns with the company’s mission to make language learning accessible globally. However, the simultaneous decision to replace contractors with AI has sparked significant backlash, raising critical questions about job security, the value of human contribution, and the potential impact of AI on content quality. As Duolingo moves forward with its AI-first approach, the tech world will be watching closely to see how it balances innovation, user experience, and the societal implications of automation.

However, bulls have failed to push decisively above the $155 resistance zone, a key level that could open the door to a broader rally. While the current price action favors buyers, the failure to break higher suggests that a retrace may be on the table if momentum continues to fade. Related Reading: Chainlink Flashes Daily Buy Signal – Breakout Next? Top analyst Jelle shared insights on X, noting that Solana’s monthly candle “is not looking too shabby.” According to Jelle, SOL took out all the consolidation lows and still managed to close the candle back above those levels—a positive technical signal suggesting resilience and potential continuation. Still, traders remain cautious, with many watching the $155–$160 area as the next big hurdle. A confirmed breakout above that zone could signal a move toward previous highs, while continued rejections might trigger a healthy correction into lower demand levels. With global markets still dealing with macroeconomic uncertainty, the next few sessions will be crucial for SOL. Bulls must act quickly to defend current levels and reclaim higher ground if they want to keep the trend in their favor. Solana At A Pivotal Level Amid Market Uncertainty Solana is currently trading at a critical level that could serve as a major pivot point for either a strong bullish recovery or a continuation of the broader bearish trend. While global tensions and ongoing trade conflicts between the U.S. and China continue to weigh on investor sentiment, recent market behavior hints at a potential bounce. The broader crypto market has shown signs of resilience, and Solana has been one of the standout performers. Since early April, Solana has climbed over 58%, recovering significantly from its local low near $95. This upward movement has helped shift short-term sentiment, but the price now faces a key test at the $160 resistance level. A clean break and hold above this zone could open the door for a larger rally, potentially taking SOL toward its previous highs. Jelle’s optimistic analysis highlights that Solana’s latest monthly candle is showing strength. According to Jelle, SOL took out all the consolidation lows and still managed to close the month back above them—typically a bullish sign. This sets the stage for a possible retest of the $240 level, a target that aligns with historical resistance and previous price action. However, failure to clear $160 could lead to renewed selling pressure, especially if global macro conditions worsen. For now, bulls must defend current levels and aim for a breakout to maintain momentum. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates Against Bitcoin – Dominance Shift On The Horizon? Crucial Test At $160 Resistance Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $147 after several days of struggling to break above the recent high of $157. Bulls have maintained control in the short term, but momentum appears to be fading as price action continues to stall below the key $160 resistance zone. This level remains a crucial barrier that needs to be reclaimed decisively to confirm a continuation of the uptrend. To sustain the bullish structure and avoid a deeper retracement, SOL must push through $160 and target the $180 level next. A successful move above this range would not only restore confidence but could also set the stage for a stronger recovery in the broader altcoin market. However, the longer Solana fails to break higher, the greater the risk of a pullback. If bulls lose momentum and selling pressure builds, a correction into the $130–$120 zone becomes increasingly likely. This area has previously served as a key demand zone and could offer support if tested again. Related Reading: Ethereum Shows 4H Bearish Divergence – Can Bulls Hold $1,750?

According to sources familiar with the negotiations, Ripple offered between $4 billion and $5 billion, but Circle turned down the proposal, reportedly viewing it as undervalued. Crypto M&A Activity Heats Up This attempted acquisition comes during a surge in crypto-related mergers, acquisitions, and IPOs. With digital assets experiencing renewed momentum and investor enthusiasm, several major players are preparing to go public. Firms such as Kraken, BitGo, Gemini, and Bullish are expected to seek IPOs in 2025, encouraged by the current pro-crypto political climate under the Trump administration. Circle itself has shown public market ambitions. Earlier this month, it filed for an initial public offering (IPO) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, aiming for a listing on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ‘CRCL’. However, just days later, reports suggested that Circle was considering delaying the IPO due to economic uncertainty stemming from shifting U.S. trade policies. Similar caution has been seen with companies like Klarna and StubHub, which are also weighing the risks of an IPO delay. Ripple’s Strategic Playbook Ripple’s interest in Circle aligns with its broader acquisition strategy. Notably, Ripple recently agreed to acquire Hidden Road, a prime brokerage firm, for $1.25 billion. This acquisition underscores Ripple’s desire to expand its ecosystem through strategic purchases rather than public fundraising. Monica Long, Ripple’s president, made it clear that Ripple is not currently considering an IPO. In an interview with CNBC, she emphasized the company’s strong financial position: “We have billions in cash reserves. We don’t need to raise capital or increase market exposure by going public.” She added, “Companies usually IPO to raise funds or elevate their brand. We’re not in need of either right now.” The Stablecoin Race: Ripple vs. Circle Ripple has also entered the stablecoin market with RLUSD, signaling its intent to compete with Circle’s dominant USDC. However, it has a long road ahead. As of May 1, RLUSD had a market cap of $317 million, dwarfed by USDC’s $62 billion valuation, according to CoinGecko. Despite the setback with Circle, Ripple may still pursue a revised offer. The company’s long-term strategy seems focused on acquisitions and internal growth rather than going public, especially after resolving its long-standing legal battle with the SEC.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|USDC,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-04-30 23:20:05

These components are crucial for training and running the sophisticated AI models that are rapidly changing industries. As the global competition in artificial intelligence heats up, governments are increasingly looking at ways to manage the flow of this critical technology. Recently, a major player in the AI space, Anthropic AI, weighed in on proposed U.S. regulations concerning the export controls of these essential AI chips. Understanding the Proposed US Export Controls on AI Chips The U.S. government has put forward a framework designed to strengthen export controls on domestic-made AI chips. This initiative stems from concerns over national security and the desire to maintain the U.S.’s lead in the AI sector, particularly in the context of the US China AI race. The proposed rules, expected to take effect around May 15, aim to create a tiered system for countries receiving these chips: Tier 3: Countries already under existing restrictions, like China and Russia, would face additional, stringent limitations. Tier 2: Countries such as Mexico and Portugal would encounter export restrictions for the first time, including caps on the quantity of chips they could acquire without special review. Tier 1: Allies like Japan and South Korea would largely continue without new export restrictions. This framework represents a significant step in U.S. AI policy, reflecting a strategic effort to control the diffusion of advanced AI capabilities globally. Why Does Anthropic AI Support Export Controls? Anthropic AI, a prominent U.S.-based AI lab, has publicly expressed its support for the government’s framework. In a recent blog post, the company stated it “strongly supports” the Department of Commerce’s proposal. This stance aligns with the broader goal of ensuring the U.S. remains competitive in the AI landscape. The company acknowledges that controlling the flow of advanced AI chips is a necessary measure in the ongoing US China AI race, where technological superiority is increasingly linked to economic and national security. Unlike some other tech giants, such as Nvidia, which previously voiced concerns that the proposed export controls were “unprecedented and misguided” and could hinder global innovation, Anthropic AI sees these measures as fundamentally beneficial for U.S. interests and long-term AI development. What Specific Tweaks Does Anthropic Suggest for AI Policy? While broadly supportive, Anthropic AI isn’t suggesting the framework is perfect. The company proposed specific adjustments to refine the implementation of these export controls. Their suggestions aim to improve the effectiveness and control mechanisms of the policy: Lowering Tier 2 Chip Caps: Anthropic recommends reducing the number of AI chips that Tier 2 countries can purchase without undergoing a formal review process. Encouraging Government-to-Government Deals: To compensate for lower direct purchase caps and potentially mitigate risks like smuggling, Anthropic suggests encouraging Tier 2 countries to acquire chips through formal government-to-government agreements. This approach could provide the U.S. with greater oversight and control over where the chips ultimately end up. Increasing Enforcement Funding: Anthropic also highlighted the importance of robust enforcement. The company believes the U.S. government should allocate more resources to ensure these export controls are properly monitored and implemented effectively across all tiers. These suggestions indicate Anthropic AI’s focus not just on the existence of controls but on their practical execution and ability to achieve their stated goals. The Role of Export Controls in the US China AI Race The debate over AI chips and export controls is intrinsically linked to the intensifying US China AI race. Both nations are investing heavily in AI research, development, and deployment. Advanced AI chips are foundational to this race, powering everything from sophisticated language models to autonomous systems and advanced computing. By controlling access to the most advanced U.S.-designed and manufactured chips, the U.S. government aims to slow down the progress of strategic competitors, particularly China, in areas deemed critical for national security. Anthropic AI’s support for these measures underscores the view within some parts of the U.S. AI industry that maintaining a technological lead requires strategic control over key components like AI chips. This perspective views export controls as a vital tool in the broader geopolitical competition. Leadership Perspectives: Dario Amodei on Export Controls The position taken by Anthropic AI is consistent with the public statements of its CEO, Dario Amodei. Mr. Amodei has been one of the more outspoken leaders in the U.S. AI community advocating for stronger export controls on advanced technology. He has argued that such controls are necessary to manage the risks associated with powerful AI and to ensure responsible development, particularly in a competitive global environment. His advocacy highlights that the discussion around AI policy and export controls is not limited to government officials but is actively debated within the highest levels of the AI industry itself, with varying perspectives on the best path forward. Summary: Anthropic’s Pragmatic Approach to AI Chips Policy In conclusion, Anthropic AI supports the U.S. government’s proposed export controls on AI chips as a means to bolster national security and maintain U.S. leadership in the US China AI race. While endorsing the core framework, the company offers pragmatic suggestions focused on refining the rules for Tier 2 countries and enhancing enforcement capabilities. Their position, championed by CEO Dario Amodei, emphasizes the importance of strategic AI policy in managing technological competition. This dialogue between government and leading AI labs like Anthropic is crucial as the U.S. navigates the complex challenges of regulating critical technologies in a rapidly changing world.

The rules will also apply to energy firms that provide electrical capacity to mining pools and companies headquartered outside Russia. Mining Crypto: VAT Charges Incoming in Russia Per the Russian media outlet RBC , the plans are the brainchild of the Ministry of Finance. The ministry said it wants to clarify the procedures for taxing the lease of crypto mining equipment. The Bitcoin network hashrate over the past three years. (Source: Blockchain.com) It also said that it wants to create tax rules for firms that provide “computing power for mining” to non-Russian clients. The VAT charges will likely apply to real-time, monthly, or annual leasing bills and transactions. The ministry said that a lack of “clear explanations” in current legislation has left providers unsure about how to declare their activities. New Charges for ‘Mining Infrastructure Operators’ A Russian law that came into force in January this year obliges all industrial crypto miners and “mining infrastructure operators (MIOs)” to sign up to a national register. The register is managed by the Federal Tax Service (FTS) , which is still finalizing plans to tax crypto miners and MIOs on their annual profits. Per the most recent FTS data, published on April 1, 116 MIOs have signed up to the register, along with 606 industrial miners. Both the FTS and other government organs believe that many more companies are still yet to sign up to the register. Commodities and shipping groups seek sanctions advice on return to Russia https://t.co/jMq6CUDaXf — FT Europe (@ftbrussels) April 30, 2025 Some have suggested introducing criminal liability for companies that fail to comply with the new law. But the FTS has urged leniency and suggested that some firms still need time to adjust to the new system. MIO firms typically provide space, equipment, and other facilities for mining crypto in custom-made data processing centers. These centers range from small buildings fitted with cooling equipment and fans to vast, factory-sized facilities capable of housing hundreds of Bitcoin mining rigs. El Salvador is still purchasing Bitcoin even after inking a loan agreement with the IMF that required it to stop accumulating the token https://t.co/uK12i0n4v7 — Bloomberg (@business) April 29, 2025 Crypto Mining Hotels Still Popular Small-scale crypto mining “hotels” also operate nationwide in Russia, with smaller centers offering total capacities of around 14 MW, and larger “hotels” boasting capacities of 100 MW and above. Investors and mining pools from all over the world have paid Russian MIOs to house their mining rigs, although some pulled out of the nation following the outbreak of war in Ukraine in February 2022. Regardless, many non-Russian pools and investors remain active in Russia, keen to access cheap electricity and relatively low overheads. The Industrial Mining Association (a collective comprising Russia’s biggest industrial miners) claimed in 2024 that if Moscow legalized mining, it could expect to reap tax revenues of around 50 billion rubles ($612 million) per year. The veracity of these claims will soon be put to the test. Some miners filed declarations on the April 25 tax deadline, meaning the world could soon learn how much tax Russia’s biggest crypto miners are now paying on their profits. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov. (Source: CNN/YouTube/Screenshot) Minister Wants Crypto Miners to Help Russian Firms Avoid Western Sanctions Lawmakers have taken a guarded stance. Anton Tkachev, the First Deputy Chairman of the State Duma’s IT Committee, said that April 25 was the industry’s first real tax test. The Russian Finance Minister, Anton Siluanov, stated early last year that his ministry did not expect crypto mining tax incomes to be “significant.” Siluanov instead suggested that Moscow will look to use the tokens produced from mining as settlement tools in foreign trade deals. Russian firms are increasingly looking to make crypto-powered cross-border trade deals using Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) as they remain frozen out of USD-denominated trade.

44003915,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154267,1746056408,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Exciting Release: JetBrains Mellum, An Open AI Coding Model",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/jetbrains-mellum-ai-coding/,"In the rapidly evolving world of technology and development, the intersection of AI and coding is becoming increasingly significant. For those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, understanding the tools that shape the future of software development is key. A notable step in this direction comes from JetBrains, a company well-known for its comprehensive suite of developer tools. They have recently unveiled something particularly interesting: JetBrains Mellum , their first truly ‘open’ AI model designed specifically for coding. Introducing JetBrains Mellum: A New AI Coding Model JetBrains, the company behind popular integrated development environments (IDEs) like IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, and others, has made a significant move by releasing its own AI coding model , Mellum. This model, which was previously integrated into JetBrains’ commercial tools, is now openly available on the AI development platform Hugging Face. This move signals a commitment to contributing to the broader AI research and development community. Key details about Mellum: It’s designed primarily for code completion, helping developers write code faster and more efficiently by suggesting snippets based on context. Mellum is a relatively compact model, weighing in at 4 billion parameters. It was trained on a substantial dataset of over 4 trillion tokens. The training involved a cluster of 256 H200 Nvidia GPUs and took around 20 days. The model is released under the permissive Apache 2.0 license. Understanding the scale: Parameters roughly indicate a model’s complexity and problem-solving capacity, while tokens represent the raw data it processed during training. JetBrains notes that a million tokens correspond to about 30,000 lines of code, giving a sense of the vast amount of information Mellum learned from. Why an Open Source AI Model Matters The decision by JetBrains to release Mellum as an open source AI model on Hugging Face is noteworthy. While many powerful AI models remain proprietary, making Mellum openly available fosters transparency, collaboration, and further innovation within the developer community. An open model allows researchers, developers, and enthusiasts to: Inspect the model’s architecture and training data (where permissible). Experiment with its capabilities. Fine-tune it for specific tasks or programming languages. Integrate it into various tools and workflows beyond JetBrains’ own ecosystem. JetBrains explicitly states that Mellum is designed for integration into professional developer tooling, AI-powered coding assistants, and research on code understanding and generation. Its open nature also makes it suitable for educational purposes and fine-tuning experiments. Focus on Code Completion AI Unlike larger, more general-purpose AI models that can write essays or generate images, Mellum has a specific focus: code completion AI . This specialization allows the model to be highly optimized for the task of predicting and suggesting code snippets within an IDE or code editor. This is a core function of modern development environments and can significantly boost developer productivity. However, JetBrains is clear that the base Mellum model requires fine-tuning before it can be effectively used. They have provided some fine-tuned examples for Python, but these are intended for evaluation and estimation of potential capabilities, not for production deployment. This highlights that while the core model is open, practical application still requires effort to adapt it to specific needs and contexts. Implications for AI Development Tools and Security The release of Mellum contributes to the growing landscape of AI development tools . As AI becomes more integrated into the software development lifecycle, tools like Mellum will become essential for developers. They promise increased speed and efficiency, but also introduce new considerations, particularly regarding security. AI-generated code, while helpful, is not immune to vulnerabilities. A survey from late 2023 by Synk indicated that over 50% of organizations frequently encounter security issues with AI-produced code. JetBrains acknowledges this, noting that Mellum’s suggestions may reflect biases present in the public codebases it was trained on and won’t necessarily be secure or free of vulnerabilities. Developers must still apply rigorous testing and security practices when using AI-assisted coding. Despite the challenges, JetBrains sees this release as a starting point. Their goal isn’t necessarily generality but focus and contribution to the community. They hope Mellum will spark meaningful experiments and collaborations. In conclusion, JetBrains’ release of Mellum as an open AI coding model is a significant development for the software industry. By focusing on code completion AI and making the model available on Hugging Face, they are contributing to the ecosystem of AI development tools and fostering open research. While challenges like fine-tuning and security require attention, JetBrains Mellum represents a valuable resource for developers and researchers exploring the future of AI-assisted coding.

The May 7, Ethereum Pectra upgrade could boost investor sentiment, but ETH’s price action shows investors are still hesitant to open new positions. Ether ( ETH ) has been trading below $1,900 since March, leading investors to question whether the failed attempt to reclaim $4,000 in December 2024 signaled the end of an era for the leading altcoin. Concerns continue to mount as derivatives market data shows that professional traders remain cautious about ETH’s price outlook. ETH monthly futures should trade at a premium of 5% or more compared to spot markets to compensate for the longer settlement period, but this indicator has held below the neutral threshold. Ether 3-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas.ch Part of the lack of enthusiasm stems from disappointment with the United States government, as Ether was classified alongside other altcoins in the “Digital Asset Stockpile” Executive Order on March 6. The Trump administration decided that only Bitcoin ( BTC ) was significant enough to be included in its own “Strategic Reserve.” In practical terms, altcoins already held by the government could be retained, but not newly acquired. Ether's market cap falls below its top four rivals For the first time ever, in April 2025, Ether’s market capitalization dropped below the combined value of its four largest competitors: Solana ( SOL ), BNB, Cardano ( ADA ), and Tron ( TRX ). Ether market cap vs. the sum of SOL, BNB, ADA, TRX. Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph After rebounding from lows near $1,400, Ether’s total market capitalization now stands at $217 billion, which is enough to surpass the combined value of its four main competitors. However, unless Ether consistently outperforms these rivals, sentiment is unlikely to improve. Some traders have high hopes for the upcoming ‘Pectra’ network upgrade , but current derivatives data does not reflect a bullish outlook. Ether’s decline has also coincided with weak demand for the Ethereum spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. Institutional interest was lacking, despite ETH’s price rising from $2,400 to $4,000 between October and December 2024. In contrast, Bitcoin ETFs saw assets more than double, growing from $50 billion in October 2024 to $110 billion currently. Ethereum leads in TVL, but there’s a catch Although Ethereum remains dominant in terms of total value locked (TVL), it has struggled to match Solana’s integrated user experience or Tron’s dominance in the stablecoin sector . Traders appear uninterested in Ethereum’s higher decentralization or improved security, especially for activities involving frequent deposits and withdrawals, where layer-2 solutions provide limited benefits. The absence of demand for leveraged bullish ETH positions does not necessarily mean that professional traders expect further price declines. If whales and market makers were unwilling to offer downside protection, this would be reflected in the ETH options markets, signaling increased risk of a market downturn. ETH 30-day options skew (put-call) at Deribit. Source: Laevitas.ch Contrary to some expectations, put (sell) options are trading at levels similar to call (buy) options. Notably, professional traders are now more comfortable with downside risks than they were two weeks ago. While ETH derivatives are not signaling strong bullish sentiment, they also do not suggest that professional traders are worried about further declines at current price levels. Related: 3 Ethereum charts flash signal last seen in 2017 when ETH price rallied 25,000% There is a chance that the upcoming ‘Pectra’ network upgrade could positively affect Ether’s price. Scheduled for May 7, this event might renew investor interest in the project by closing the gap with some of its competitors. Staking mechanisms designed for institutional investors could result in more ETH being locked in validator nodes, reducing the circulating supply. Historically, Ethereum upgrades have often been associated with brief spikes in ETH’s price.

Analyst Ali Martinez tells his 136,500 followers on the social media platform X that XRP can surge as high as 30% from current levels after breaking out of an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. The structure is typically considered bullish as it suggests that buyers are ready to step in without waiting for the asset’s price to revisit recent lows. “XRP looks to be breaking out of an inverse head and shoulders pattern, with a potential upside target between $2.70 and $2.90.” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, XRP is worth $2.23. Looking at the top memecoin Dogecoin, Martinez says that DOGE needs to recover a key price level to gather momentum and trigger a potential rally toward its record high. “If Dogecoin DOGE can secure a monthly close above $0.20, it could pave the way for a rally toward its all-time high of $0.74. Such a breakout would signal strong bullish momentum and potentially attract increased investor interest.” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, DOGE is trading for $0.173. Turning to the layer-1 protocol Solana, Martinez believes that SOL is forming a large bullish continuation pattern that could send the altcoin to an astronomically high price target above $3,500. “Zooming out, Solana SOL appears to form a textbook-perfect cup and handle pattern!” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, SOL is trading at $145. As for the fellow layer-1 protocol Cardano ( ADA ), the trader says the altcoin needs to take out the diagonal resistance of a descending channel to spark new rallies. A descending channel suggests that an asset is in a downtrend as its price prints lower highs and lower lows. “Cardano ADA is approaching a major test at $0.74. A breakout above this level could pave the way for a move toward $0.88.” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, ADA is worth $0.694.

XRP, Optimism, Sei, and Ethereum Are Gaining Fast",https://thecoinrise.com/early-2025-momentum-xrp-optimism-sei-and-ethereum-are-gaining-fast/,"Crypto markets are showing fresh momentum in Q2 2025, and several key altcoins are leading the charge. XRP , Optimism (OP) , Sei (SEI) , and Ethereum (ETH) are all gaining attention for their bullish setups, institutional signals, or unique roles in the evolving blockchain ecosystem. As capital flows into well-positioned projects, traders and analysts alike are turning their focus to early indicators of breakout potential. Ethereum and XRP Continue to Lead Ethereum (ETH) is trading near $1,739 , supported by whale accumulation, healthy RSI levels, and bullish crossovers. Momentum is being driven by surging activity in AI-related tokens and a spike in on-chain volume. Forecasts for Ethereum’s price path in 2025 remain optimistic, with upside targets between $2,500 and $2,700 in the months ahead. XRP , currently around $2.15 , is benefiting from increased institutional access after the recent approval of XRP futures ETFs. Technical setups point toward a possible move beyond the $2.45 resistance zone, which could trigger renewed inflows from both retail and institutional investors. Optimism (OP) and Sei (SEI) Quietly Position for Growth Optimism (OP) remains one of Ethereum’s most critical Layer 2 scaling solutions. Although recent updates have been sparse, the project continues to evolve its ecosystem. With prices stable and real-time trades near $3.25 , OP is viewed as undervalued by many long-term holders awaiting a broader L2 resurgence. Sei (SEI) is maintaining momentum as a fast-growing infrastructure chain focused on trading and performance. Though lacking headline news recently, its real-time value around $0.29 reflects consistent market confidence. Analysts expect SEI to play a more visible role if demand for scalable, low-latency platforms increases.

These AI agents can browse products, make purchases, and handle payments on behalf of users, streamlining the online shopping experience.​ The AI agents will harness the latest technology introduced by some of the biggest tech companies, such as Visa, which collaborates with Microsoft, OpenAI, and Anthropic to realize this vision. Visa’s new system, Visa Intelligent Commerce, will enable consumers to assign an AI agent to perform tasks, like booking a vacation, making a grocery order, or finding a fashionable outfit — and do so within a budget and according to personal tastes. Jack Forestell, Visa’s Chief Product and Strategy Officer, said that just as the shift from physical to digital retail had accelerated, the transition to digital-first commerce was underway. The pilot program is set to launch this year, with a full rollout expected by 2026. Changing shopping habits force advertising shifts Visa CEO Ryan McInerney says AI agents will soon eliminate outdated forms of advertising. Instead of being influenced by flashy banners or social media hype, digital assistants will prioritize data, user behavior, reviews, pricing, and peer preferences to guide purchasing decisions. With AI in the driver’s seat, businesses can no longer rely solely on polished marketing campaigns to reach consumers. To stay competitive, they must deliver genuine value, meet real needs, and stand out in AI-driven recommendation engines. Experts say this change will force businesses to provide value and quality rather than compete for attention. McInerney said on Bloomberg TV that a seismic shift in advertising was coming, predicting it would become more personalized, data-driven, and likely more nuanced. In other words, AI agents could be the new gatekeepers between brands and buyers. Visa has already spent over $3 billion on AI and data infrastructure in the last 10 years alone, The company is leveraging AI not just to make shopping better but to make it easier and more secure to pay. Powered by Visa technology, these AI agents can securely and confidentially get access to someone’s payment credentials and make transactions with a provider rapidly and without any inconvenience. With Visa’s advanced systems , consumers will retain full control—setting purchase limits, approving transactions, and monitoring their spending in real-time. Outside of the U.S., Visa also considers opportunities in high-growth economies such as India. The company is also negotiating investment with local AI startups to expand its footprint and serve users in other regions better. Rivals such as Mastercard and PayPal are also moving into AI shopping. However, Visa is betting its partnerships and early investments will give it a solid lead in one of the fastest-evolving areas of payments. Visa leads the shift to AI-driven commerce The emergence of AI shopping agents heralds a new era in how people shop and companies sell. Instead of hours of searching online, people will tell an AI what they want, and the agent will handle all the work. It will find the best deals, compare quality, check reviews, and even handle payments. For customers, it equates to saving time while seeing better results. For brands, that means finding new ways of reaching and retaining customers. Visa is wagering that AI-enabled commerce will be the next normal. It sets itself up to control the whole process, from discovering products to receiving the payment. McInerney said that payments were certain to evolve to support these changes and added that Visa was looking forward to the role it would play in making it happen.

Charts Say It’s Possible,https://cryptonews.com/news/can-these-3-tokens-really-hit-1-charts-say-its-possible/,"Meme coins are heating up again – and the charts are flashing green. Several top tokens are now teasing breakout potential, backed by rising momentum and growing community hype. As crypto regains its spotlight in both tech and finance, these low-cost contenders are catching serious attention. Let’s dive into three sub-$1 meme coins that could be gearing up for a major move – and possibly a run to that elusive $1 milestone. Dogecoin ($DOGE): Charts Suggest a New Breakout for the Canine King of Meme Tokens Dogecoin ($DOGE) continues to lead the meme coin movement with a $26.2 billion valuation reaffirming its position as the keystone of the memeverse. First launched in 2013 by Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer as a playful experiment, DOGE has transformed into one of the most recognized digital currencies globally. Unlike the newer generation of meme coins, Dogecoin enjoys extensive liquidity and established market presence. Its price frequently moves in tandem with Bitcoin, offering a level of stability that most meme tokens struggle to achieve. At present, DOGE is trading at $0.1757 after dipping 2% in line with the rest of the meme coin market. However, Dogecoin is now breaking out of a descending wedge — a classic technical pattern associated with bullish reversals, which you can see in the diagonal falling support and resistance lines from November to April. With a Relative Strength Index (RSI) reading of 54, DOGE is looking to rally again. With a few market rallies expected in May the token’s supporters are eyeing a move toward $0.48 — representing a potential 173% return from current levels. Adoption trends remain strong, too. Tesla continues to accept DOGE for select transactions, while platforms like PayPal and Revolut have introduced DOGE into their payment systems, reinforcing its growing utility. MIND of Pepe ($MIND): Fusing AI Innovation With Meme Culture MIND of Pepe ($MIND) blends viral meme appeal with emerging AI technology, positioning itself as more than just another internet joke coin. While it draws aesthetic inspiration from the iconic Pepe meme, this token is backed by real utility. Token holders gain access to a suite of AI-powered tools — including a crypto oracle and automated sentiment bot — offering real-time analytics, market predictions, and trading signals. Monument. $MIND pic.twitter.com/pcAJjfbTLg — MIND of Pepe (@MINDofPepe) April 18, 2025 So far, the project has raised over $8.5 million in early funding rounds. For passive income seekers, staking $MIND offers attractive returns, with annual yields reaching as high as 267%. As artificial intelligence reshapes everything from finance to content creation, MIND of Pepe is carving out a niche at the intersection of fun and function. Stay connected with MIND of Pepe on X (formerly Twitter) and Telegram . Brett ($BRETT): The Meme King of the Base Network Like Pepe, Brett ($BRETT) is inspired by a character in Matt Furie’s Boy’s Club . Unlike Pepe though, Brett exists on Base — Coinbase’s proprietary Ethereum Layer 2 network. After months of downward consolidation, Brett has seen a powerful rebound, with the price currently stabilizing above $0.06311 after a strong breakout. The token recently broke through a long-standing falling wedge formation, peaking at $0.071 and signaling renewed optimism among traders. In the last week, Brett has advanced 33%. A brief sell-off is likely to nominally depreciate the price overnight, but if Brett gets to $0.08, it will have stronger support for a further sally. Backed by strong trading volume and improving sentiment, Brett looks poised for another leg higher, with $0.10 within reach — and if market enthusiasm intensifies, a longer-term move toward $1 remains a possibility.

SOL futures open interest hit $5.75 billion on April 30, showing strong institutional interest. With rising DEX volumes and a $9.5 billion TVL, SOL could rally to $200 before a potential spot ETF approval on Oct. 10. Solana’s native token, SOL ( SOL ), fell 4% between April 29 and April 30 after failing to sustain the $150 level. Despite this short-term decline, traders seem more confident as the $140 support remained intact for a whole week, an outcome that hadn’t happened in over two months. As demand for leveraged SOL positions reached near record highs on April 30, traders are now reconsidering the chances of a SOL rally above $200. Solana futures aggregate open interest, SOL. Source: CoinGlass SOL futures open interest climbed to 40.5 million SOL on April 30, marking a 5% increase from the previous month and nearing its all-time high. In dollar terms, this represents $5.75 billion in futures positions, ranking third in the cryptocurrency market and over 50% higher than the demand for XRP derivatives. This strong adoption of SOL derivatives points to growing institutional interest. Data shows increased demand for bearish leveraged SOL positions Traders often believe that increased demand for SOL futures signals rising optimism. However, since longs (buyers) and shorts (sellers) are always matched, a rise in open interest does not necessarily indicate a bullish outlook. To better understand leverage demand in SOL futures, one can look at the funding rate for perpetual contracts. ETH perpetual futures 8-hour funding rate. Source: Laevitas.ch Currently, the funding rate on SOL perpetual futures is negative, which shows more demand for bearish positions. The last period of moderate optimism ended on April 25 after a failed attempt to break above $156. The lack of bullish leveraged positions may be partly due to the 43% price gain SOL saw in the three weeks from April 8 to April 29. A $200 target for SOL may seem ambitious, but the token was trading near $195 in mid-February, even after decentralized application volumes had dropped by 80% from their January peak. While Solana has faced criticism for its heavy reliance on memecoins, there is more to the network than just speculation on new tokens. Total value locked (TVL) on Solana Network, USD. Source: DefiLlama Solana ranks second in total value locked (TVL), with $9.5 billion in deposits, including liquid staking , collateralized loans, automated yield platforms, and synthetic derivatives. Several Solana decentralized applications are among the top fee earners, with Meteora collecting $19.1 million in seven days, followed by Pump-fun with $18.6 million and Juto with $14.6 million. Solana network dominates volumes on decentralized exchanges Since April 14, Ethereum’s average base layer transaction fee has been $0.65 or less, yet Solana’s decentralized exchanges have seen nearly 90% higher trading volumes. Even when including the entire Ethereum layer-2 ecosystem, Solana led the past week with $21.6 billion in decentralized exchange activity. Decentralized exchange volumes, 7-day market share. Source: DefiLlama Positive highlights from the Solana network include an 87% weekly increase in Raydium’s volumes and a 58% rise in Meteora activity. So, even if demand for bullish leveraged positions stays flat, SOL’s price could eventually reflect the improved onchain metrics.

Analysts believe the final deadline for the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s decision is Oct. 10, with a 90% chance of approval. Still, SOL might rally above $200 before this event, as the network is well-positioned to attract new retail investors.

XRP, MATIC, Sei, and Arbitrum Offer Potential Upside",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/will-ethereum-fuel-the-next-big-move-xrp-matic-sei-and-arbitrum-offer-potential-upside/,"The cryptocurrency market is eyeing Ethereum (ETH) as a potential driver of broader altcoin momentum. With Ethereum hovering near $1,739 and maintaining bullish indicators, investors are closely watching correlated moves in assets like XRP , Polygon (MATIC) , Sei (SEI) , and Arbitrum (ARB) . All are showing varying degrees of promise—and as May begins, analysts expect an uptick in volatility and opportunity. Ethereum’s Setup and Ripple Effects Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading around $1,739 , following a strong April marked by whale accumulation and rising demand in AI-related tokens. Technical signals like a recent golden cross and a neutral RSI support the view that ETH may soon break past key levels toward $2,500 . Reduced transaction fees and on-chain activity growth are adding to the bullish case. Ethereum’s strength tends to spill over into Layer 2 ecosystems and select altcoins, making this a key moment for projects directly or indirectly linked to its growth. Altcoins to Watch: XRP, MATIC, SEI, and ARB XRP , trading at approximately $2.15 , is riding high on ETF-driven momentum. With the U.S. approval of XRP futures ETFs and upcoming launches on CME Group’s platform, institutional interest is spiking. Traders are watching for a breakout past $2.45 , which could lead to extended rallies. Polygon (MATIC) continues to benefit from Ethereum’s momentum. Though it’s seen consolidation recently, 2025 price projections remain bullish with expectations tied to post-halving trends. With real-time pricing between $1.02–$1.04 , MATIC remains a key player among scalable Ethereum-aligned solutions. Sei (SEI) , despite a quieter news cycle, is maintaining stable price levels. It continues to build core infrastructure, especially in the trading and finance layer. Market watchers suggest SEI could see renewed action as Layer 1 narratives heat up in Q2. Arbitrum (ARB) , trading around $0.35 , faces a more uncertain outlook. It recently dropped sharply after exiting Nvidia’s AI Accelerator program, triggering concern among investors. Still, if sentiment around Layer 2s improves, ARB could find renewed strength off its current support levels.

The pattern indicates that SOL is coiling up, potentially preparing for a significant move once a breakout occurs. This period of sideways trading isn’t without significance. Historically, such consolidation phases can act as a prelude to sharp breakouts or breakdowns. Traders are now closely watching for volume spikes or candlestick signals that could hint at the next major trend. Current Market Context: Why Solana Consolidation Matters GemXBT emphasized that key support lies below the current price, around the $146 level, which has acted as a crucial buffer, preventing further declines and helping to maintain short-term stability. On the upside, immediate resistance is forming near $150, a level that has previously halted bullish advances. This resistance zone is now being closely monitored, as a breakout above it could trigger a stronger upward push. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Holding Strong Above $150 — Breakout Zone In Play GemXBT further elaborated on the technical indicators that support SOL’s current consolidation outlook. He noted that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) continues to hover in the neutral zone, reflecting the prevailing market indecision. This midpoint reading indicates that neither bullish nor bearish momentum is dominant at the moment, which aligns with Solana’s sideways price movement. The lack of an overbought or oversold signal suggests that a breakout in either direction is still on the table, making the coming sessions particularly crucial for confirming the next trend. In addition, GemXBT highlighted that the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has recently formed a minor bearish crossover, which could be an early warning sign of building downward pressure. Although the signal isn’t strong enough to confirm a trend reversal yet, it does raise concerns, especially if the $147 support level fails to hold. The Battle Between Bulls And Bears Based on GemXBT analysis, as Solana continues to consolidate between the $146 and $150 range, the market is at a crucial indecision point. After breaking out of the zone between $146 and $150, the next resistance to watch is the $164 level. If buyers are able to push the price past this barrier, it could pave the way for a rally toward the $211 level and beyond, marking a significant shift in momentum and market sentiment. Related Reading: Solana Price Enters Consolidation Trend Above $130 That Could End In A Breakout However, if bearish pressure intensifies and the $146 support gives way, it might trigger a sharper decline as sellers regain control. In that case, lower support areas such as $137 and $118 would come into play quickly. With both Solana bulls and bears eyeing these pivotal levels, the next decisive move is likely to set the tone for SOL’s short-term trend.

The banking system is criticized for inefficiencies and prioritizing the ultra-wealthy. Eric Trump emphasizes the growing role of cryptocurrencies in shaping the future of finance. Eric Trump, the head of the Trump Organization in the United States, the son of the country’s President, has sounded a dire outlook on the future of traditional banking. During an interview with CNBC on April 30, 2025, he explained that if banks fail to adapt to the use of cryptocurrencies, they will be obsolete within the next 10 years. According to him, the emergence of crypto is a threat to the banking sector. He complained about the contemporary financial system, stating that it is ineffective and cumbersome to use. Eric Trump noted that existing banks are expensive and tend to favor catering to high-net-worth investors. In his opinion, this broken system, when combined with slow transaction methods such as SWIFT, has led him into the realm of cryptocurrencies.

Robinhood’s Q1 results shared on April 30 show revenues fell 8.6% from the previous quarter to $927 million, topping Zacks analyst estimates by 3.16%. The company’s crypto revenue plummeted nearly 30% quarter-on-quarter to $252 million from the firm’s record-setting Q4 2024. The drop could be partly attributed to the Trump administration’s tariffs, which triggered an 18% fall in the crypto market cap over the quarter. Crypto trading volume on Robinhood also fell 35% over Q1 compared to the fourth quarter of 2024, which the firm attributed to a 10% drop in customer trades placed and a 27% fall in average notional volume per trade. Robinhood CEO Vladimir Tenev said on an earnings call that crypto trading volumes would continue to fluctuate but the firm is more focused on capturing as much market share as possible. Despite the fall from last quarter, Robinhood’s crypto revenue rose 100% from the same quarter a year ago, while trading volumes jumped 28% over the same period.

Source: Robinhood The firm also added $500 million to its now $1.5 billion buyback authorization program, aimed at boosting shareholder value and confidence in the firm’s financial health. The company has bought back $667 million worth of shares so far. Shares in Robinhood (HOOD) rose 1.51% in after-hours trading on April 30 to $49.85 since the firm disclosed its Q1 results, Google Finance data shows. Tenev said Robinhood’s $200 million acquisition of Bitstamp crypto exchange is still looking likely to receive regulatory approval in the middle of 2025, which would enable it to serve institutional investors in the US. Regulatory pressure also eased for Robinhood in Q1 after the Securities and Exchange Commission closed its investigation into the firm’s crypto business on Feb. 21. Crypto tokenization remains a key focus for Robinhood Tenev said Robinhood is still exploring integrating crypto tokenization into the company’s services. Tokenizing private equities is a “huge unlock” for both individuals and companies that can solve a lot of problems in secondary market transactions, he said. Related: Ripple $4B-$5B bid to purchase Circle rejected — Report “I think that will unlock a ton of economic value for the crypto industry in the US,” Tenev said.

The accord was signed in Washington after months of tense negotiations, with uncertainty lingering until the final moments due to an eleventh-hour issue. This agreement establishes a joint investment fund for Ukraine’s reconstruction as Trump tries to secure a peace settlement in Russia’s three-year-old war in Ukraine. The correspondence is important to Kyiv’s efforts to improve its relationship with Trump and the White House, which was not good after he took office in January. U.S.-Ukraine pact seeks to cement support and economic recovery amid ongoing war According to a Treasury post on X, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Ukrainian First Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko were shown signing the agreement, which noted the deal “clearly signals the Trump Administration’s commitment to a free, sovereign, prosperous Ukraine.” Svyrydenko said on X that the accord allows Washington to contribute to the fund. Since Russia’s 2022 invasion, Washington has been Ukraine’s largest military donor, contributing over 64 billion euros ($72 billion) in aid, according to the Kiel Institute in Germany. Prior to the signing, Trump reiterated on Wednesday that the U.S. should receive something in return for its support to Kyiv, leading to the push for a deal focused on Ukraine’s abundant rare earth mineral deposits. In announcing the agreement, the U.S. Treasury pointed out that the U.S. has “provided significant financial and material support to Ukraine’s defense” following Russia’s invasion. A deal draft revealed that Ukraine won a removal of any obligation regarding reimbursing the U.S. for previous assistance, a point that Kyiv had vigorously fought. According to Ukrainian officials, the deal strengthened American support for Kyiv during the war. Still, the draft did not spell out any precise U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine, which was one of Kyiv’s top goals. In a separate move, Ukraine has been discussing with European allies the creation of an international force to help protect its security if a peace settlement is eventually reached with Russia. In a statement, the Treasury Department said the fund is in “recognition of the significant financial and material support that the people of the United States have provided to the defense of Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion” and will help “accelerate Ukraine’s economic recovery.” Minerals-for-aid deal revived after February fallout The current agreement appears to be the same as the original deal, which was set to be signed in February and indicated that Ukraine would put 50% of the proceeds from its state-owned mineral resources into a fund jointly owned with the U.S. The BBC reported that no security guarantees were outlined for Ukraine. The deal originated after President Donald Trump indicated Ukraine could give the U.S. access to its minerals in return for U.S. support of Ukraine in its ongoing war with Russia and described the potential agreement as a reimbursement for the U.S. aid. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled to the U.S. in February to reportedly sign the deal. However, he left the White House without signing it after an Oval Office meeting between him and Trump ended in a shouting match . Zelenskyy put out a statement days after the visit saying he wanted to end the war with Russia and that Ukraine was ready to sign the minerals deal. He saw it as “a step toward greater security and solid security guarantees.” Back in February, experts expressed concerns about the cost and production times associated with mining raw materials, and some said the mining might not result in a huge payoff. Benchmark Minerals Intelligence rare earths pricing analyst George Ingall noted that the minerals the U.S. desired at the time “won’t be used to make a profit in the next 10 or 15 years.” Ingall also said operationalizing a rare earth mineral mine takes up to $2 billion. While a minerals deal may take time to benefit the U.S. financially, obtaining the natural resources from Ukraine could help reduce the U.S.’ reliance on China and Russia to import the materials.

This meteoric 412,055% surge underscores the crypto market’s potential for life-altering returns.

Starting at $0.006 its price soared to $3.84 by early 2018. This 63,900% spike turned modest investments into fortunes cementing XRP’s place in crypto lore. However regulatory battles particularly the SEC lawsuit have since capped its momentum. Despite a partial legal win in 2024, XRP’s growth remains tethered to market sentiment and institutional adoption.

As phase 4 nears its close the urgency to join before the 20% price hike to $0.03 in phase 5 intensifies. Presale Gains and Post-Launch Potential Investors snapping up Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens at $0.025 are poised for a 20% gain when phase 5 kicks in at $0.03. The tokenomics guarantee a 140% return at the $0.06 exchange listing a figure rooted in the presale’s structured pricing. Looking further analysts project a post-launch price of $2.75 in 2025 fueled by the platform’s lending innovations and growing adoption. This translates to a jaw-dropping 10,900% ROI from the current price dwarfing XRP’s recent performance. The team is also finalizing a Certik audit of its smart contracts with results soon to be shared on social channels bolstering trust as the project scales. Unlike XRP which leans on institutional partnerships Mutuum Finance (MUTM) thrives on user-driven DeFi utility. Its dual lending model—peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer—caters to diverse crypto assets while mtTokens accrue interest for depositors offering passive income. The $100,000 giveaway, awarding $10,000 in MUTM tokens to ten presale participants, adds fervor to the already brisk phase 4 sales. With 425 million tokens already claimed, the window to secure tokens at this low entry point is shrinking fast, echoing the early days of XRP’s ascent when timing was everything. Echoes of XRP’s Golden Era Mutuum Finance (MUTM) mirrors the early allure of XRP’s 2017 surge, where early adopters reaped colossal rewards. While XRP’s path now wades through regulatory fog, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a clearer runway with its presale structure and DeFi focus. A $1,000 investment today could yield $2,400 at listing or soar to $110,000 if the $2.75 target hits in 2025. Don’t miss out—join the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale now to lock in tokens before phase 5 raises the stakes.

Analysts predict XRP could rise to new all-time highs again in 2025. XRP price dropped by 5% over the past 24 hours as US GDP data showed a shrinking economy . However, a strengthening market structure and investors’ growing hope for a spot XRP ETF approval in the United States suggest that the altcoin might revisit its April peak at $2.36 in the short term. XRP/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/ TradingView Technical charts currently show XRP ( XRP ) trading within a falling wedge pattern. A ""falling wedge"" is a bullish reversal chart pattern that comprises two converging trend lines that connect lower lows and lower highs. This convergence indicates weakening downward momentum. The pattern will resolve when the price breaks above the upper trendline at $2.40, and if this happens, buyers could target $3.74 next, representing a 71% increase from the current price. XRP/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/ TradingView The relative strength index (RSI) is above the midline, indicating that the market conditions still favor the upside. However, to sustain the ongoing recovery, XRP price has to first hold the support at $2.20 and then overcome the resistance between $2.80 and $3.00. Several analysts remain optimistic about the altcoin’s ability to rebound to all-time highs, with popular trader Dark Defender saying that the ongoing correction is part of an Elliott Wave pattern that will eventually see “XRP continue its climb to the top.” Fellow trader Allincrypto believes XRP is “heading to $19.27” based on a breakout from a falling wedge pattern. “Where we are pulling back is textbook perfect, and we had highlighted a falling wedge that was present on XRP that ultimately was just going for a continuation to $19.27.” Related: What are XRP futures and how to invest in them? Approval odds for an XRP ETF approval in 2025 rise Bloomberg senior ETF analysts said that the five spot XRP ETFs, including Grayscale, 21Shares, WisdomTree, Bitwise, Canary, and Franklin Templeton, have an 85% chance of approval after the change in leadership at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This is a significant improvement from their prediction over two months ago that set the chances of an XRP approval in 2025 at 65%.

Over the past week, the probability of approval has swung 17% in favor of the bullish masses, which was around 63% on April 23. XRP ETF approval odds on Polymarket.

The approval of these ETFs could unlock institutional capital, amplifying demand for the XRP. While approval timelines remain unclear, they would mark a step toward mainstream adoption for XRP.

Meanwhile, a prominent member of the XRP community has hinted that May 1st and June 9th are two dates that community members should look forward to. ProShares Debunks XRP ETF Launch Data A ProShares spokesperson has debunked reports that the firm’s XRP ETF is set to launch on April 30. The spokesperson confirmed that there are no ETF launches scheduled for April 30 and there was no update to share on a potential launch yet. In an X post, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart also debunked the April 30 rumors for the ProShares XRP ETF launch. He stated that they have confirmed that this is not the case and that there is no launch date yet. However, he stated that they believe the ETF will launch, likely in the short term or possibly the medium term. Although the exact launch date remains unknown, ProShares, in a recent SEC filing, proposed that the XRP ETF should go live on May 14. However, this is undoubtedly still subject to approval from the Commission. It is worth mentioning that the ETF is based on XRP futures, not spot, and will not provide direct exposure to the altcoin but to leveraged contracts instead. Earlier this month, Teucrium Investment Advisors launched the first-ever leveraged XRP ETFs in the US. Besides the potential launch of another leveraged XRP ETF, another event worth looking forward to in May is the launch of the CME Group XRP futures. The derivatives exchange announced earlier this month that it will add XRP futures to its crypto suite on May 19, pending regulatory approval. The XRP futures launch would further solidify the case for the approval of a Spot XRP ETF. The SEC recently delayed its decision on Franklin Templeton’s XRP ETF, but Seyffart explained that it was to be expected. The analyst doesn’t expect the SEC to approve or deny the fund until later in the year, possibly in the fourth quarter. Two Dates To Keep An Eye On While asset managers have shown their intention to offer XRP-related investment products, others like BlackRock seem still hesitant, with the world’s largest asset manager yet to make any filing. However, Bale, a prominent XRP community member, suggested that it won’t be too long before BlackRock also files for an XRP ETF and revealed two dates to keep an eye on. In an X post, he stated that he had met with someone from BlackRock who gave him May 1 and June 9 as the two dates to watch. This has raised speculations that the asset manager could file for an XRP ETF on one of these days.",Altcoins|XRP|Altcoin|Bale|BlackRock|Bloomberg|CME Group XRP Futures|Franklin Templeton|James Seyffart|Proshares|SEC|Teucrium Investment Advisors|XRP ETFs|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-05-01 01:00:24
