Not a few dollars, but potentially hundreds of millions. That’s the reality for James Howells, an IT professional from Wales, who accidentally discarded a hard drive containing thousands of Bitcoin years ago. His decade-long mission to recover this treasure from a landfill has become the stuff of legend in the crypto world, and now, this incredible saga is set to reach a global audience. Entertainment startup Lebul has officially acquired the rights to develop content based on Howells’ extraordinary story. This isn’t just a simple news report; Lebul plans a comprehensive project encompassing a docuseries, a podcast, and engaging social-first content. The goal is to dive deep into every aspect of this modern-day treasure hunt, blending the high-stakes world of blockchain technology with the very grounded, complex issues of environmental impact and human persistence. The Origin of the Lost Bitcoin Fortune The tale begins back in 2013. James Howells had been one of the early adopters of Bitcoin, mining thousands of coins on a Dell laptop. After spilling a drink on the laptop, he disassembled it and kept the hard drive, thinking he might recover data later. However, during a clear-out, the crucial hard drive – which held the private keys to access over 8,000 BTC – was mistakenly thrown away and ended up in the local landfill site in Newport, Wales. At the time, Bitcoin’s value was relatively low, and the loss didn’t seem catastrophic. But as BTC’s price soared over the following years, reaching tens of thousands of dollars per coin, the true magnitude of the loss became staggering. The 8,000+ BTC, at its peak valuation, represented a fortune exceeding $800 million, making it one of the most valuable instances of lost Bitcoin in history. Why is This Bitcoin Recovery Story So Compelling? Howells’ quest resonates with people for many reasons. It’s more than just a story about lost money; it touches upon universal themes: The Scale of the Loss: The sheer amount of value lost is almost unfathomable, capturing the imagination. Relatability: Everyone has lost something important, but losing hundreds of millions due to a simple mistake amplifies that feeling dramatically. Tech Meets Trash: A cutting-edge digital asset is lost in the most mundane, physical place – a landfill. The contrast is stark. Persistence Against Odds: Howells has spent a decade battling bureaucracy, skepticism, and logistical nightmares, showcasing incredible determination. The Environmental Dilemma: The potential environmental impact of digging up a massive landfill site adds a layer of complexity and debate to the mission. This mix of high finance, personal tragedy, technological mystery, and environmental concern makes the Bitcoin recovery story uniquely captivating. The Landfill Bitcoin Challenge: More Than Just Digging Recovering a hard drive from a landfill isn’t like finding a needle in a haystack; it’s like finding a specific grain of sand on a vast beach. The Newport landfill is enormous, receiving thousands of tons of waste annually. Howells’ hard drive could be buried under meters of garbage accumulated over the past decade. The challenges are immense: Logistics: Excavating the relevant section of the landfill requires heavy machinery, a large team, and sophisticated sorting technology. Cost: Howells has estimated the operation could cost millions of dollars, requiring significant investment and funding. Environmental Concerns: Disturbing the landfill could release harmful gases, contaminate soil and groundwater, and disrupt local ecosystems. The Newport City Council has repeatedly cited environmental risks as a primary reason for denying his requests for excavation permits. Technology: Howells’ recovery plans involve cutting-edge technology, including AI-powered sorting machines to identify potential hard drives among the waste and even robotic dogs for surveying the site. Regulatory Hurdles: Gaining permission from the local council and environmental agencies has been the biggest roadblock, highlighting the complex interplay between personal wealth, technological ambition, and public/environmental safety. Finding the specific hard drive is just the first step; there’s also the question of whether it’s still functional after years of exposure to the elements and pressure within the landfill. This uncertainty adds another layer of drama to the Landfill Bitcoin saga. Lebul’s Vision: A Crypto Documentary Like No Other Lebul’s acquisition of the rights signals a major effort to bring this story to a mainstream audience. Their multi-platform approach is designed to capture different facets of the narrative: The Docuseries: This will likely be the core of the project, providing a chronological narrative of Howells’ life, the loss, the realization of the value, and his relentless efforts to recover the drive. It can explore the technical aspects of Bitcoin, the environmental debate surrounding the landfill, and the human drama of pursuing such an unlikely goal. The Podcast: A podcast format allows for deeper dives into specific topics, interviews with experts (on blockchain, environmental science, landfill management), and perhaps even a week-by-week update if the recovery attempt ever gets underway. Social-First Content: Short, engaging clips and visuals tailored for social media platforms can help build buzz and explain complex ideas in an accessible way, reaching a younger, digitally-native audience interested in crypto and unique stories. By blending compelling storytelling with explanations of blockchain technology and discussions on environmental responsibility, Lebul aims to create a Crypto documentary that appeals beyond just the crypto community, drawing in viewers interested in true crime, environmental issues, or simply incredible human interest stories. What Does This Mean for James Howells Bitcoin? For James Howells, this development is a significant step. Having the rights acquired by an entertainment company like Lebul not only validates the dramatic potential of his story but also provides a platform to potentially gain wider support or even attract investors for his complex recovery operation. While the docuseries itself won’t recover the hard drive, the increased public awareness and potential funding could bring him closer to his goal. Howells has always maintained that if he succeeds, he plans to share a significant portion of the recovered fortune with the city of Newport, funding local projects and even an environmental cleanup of the landfill site. This proposed philanthropic element adds a layer of altruism to the pursuit of immense personal wealth, making the James Howells Bitcoin narrative even more intriguing. The Broader Lesson: Securing Your Crypto While Howells’ story is unique in its scale and location, the underlying issue of lost private keys is a significant one in the crypto world. Millions of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are estimated to be permanently lost due to misplaced hard drives, forgotten passwords, or lost seed phrases. Howells’ experience serves as a dramatic, albeit extreme, reminder of the importance of secure private key management and storage. Unlike traditional banks, there’s no customer service line to call when you lose access to your digital assets. Conclusion: A Modern Treasure Hunt Unfolds James Howells’ quest for his lost Bitcoin from a Welsh landfill is a modern-day treasure hunt unlike any other. It’s a story packed with immense value, technological hurdles, environmental debates, and the sheer willpower of one individual. Lebul’s commitment to developing a comprehensive content project around this saga ensures that this fascinating intersection of crypto, environment, and human drama will be explored in depth, offering audiences a captivating look at one of the most unique stories in the history of digital currency. As Lebul begins production, the world will be watching to see how this incredible Bitcoin recovery story is told.

The firm filed the preliminary prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on April 29. According to the filing , the shares will track BlackRock’s BLF Treasury Trust Fund (TTTXX), a $150 billion fund that invests mainly in US Treasury bills, notes, cash, and other obligations issued and guaranteed by the US Treasury. The firm stated that the shares will be sold through the Bank of New York (BNY) Mellon, with the bank keeping a mirror record of transactions and share ownership on the blockchain. However, it added that the fund does not currently use blockchain technology. The preliminary prospectus reads: “Although the Fund does not currently employ blockchain technology or invest in crypto assets, the Financial Intermediary through whom shareholders purchase and redeem DLT Shares intends to employ blockchain technology to maintain a mirror record of share ownership for its customers.” Unsurprisingly, the product is only available to institutional investors with a minimum investment of $3 million to participate. The firm has yet to propose a ticker for the DLT shares but specified that the management fee will be 0.18%. Tokenized treasuries already over $6 billion The move by BlackRock highlights the continued exploration of blockchain technologies by traditional financial institutions to launch new products. BlackRock is already a key participant in this sector with its tokenized US Treasury product, BUIDL, being the biggest tokenized treasury product. The firm is bullish on blockchain technology and tokenization with the chairman, Larry Fink, identifying the importance of tokenization in making financial products more accessible to investors. According to data from rwa.xyz , BUIDL, which is a product of Securitize and BlackRock, currently has $2.556 billion in assets under management (AUM) and has seen a net inflow of more than $600 million in the last 30 days. With only 70 holders, its performance captures the solid interest in tokenized products, especially from institutional investors in the decentralized finance sector. BlackRock BUIDL has seen the highest netflow in the last 30 days (Source: rwa.xyz) However, other tokenized treasury products are also attracting sizable interest, even if they are not growing on a similar level as BUIDL. Overall, the sector now has $6.16 billion in AUM from 44 products. The next product with the highest AUM after BUIDL is Franklin Templeton’s BENJI, with $706.77 million. Others, such as Superstate USTB, Ondo USDY, and OUSG, and Circle USYC, also have over $400 million in AUM each. Despite the growth of these products, many industry experts believe this is still an early stage, and the sector is primed for more growth. Standard Chartered experts predict that the tokenization market could be worth $30 trillion by 2030. BlackRock IBIT sees record inflows Meanwhile, BUIDL is not the only crypto-related product from BlackRock that has enjoyed a massively positive performance in recent times. The firm’s Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), IBIT, also recorded its second-largest daily inflow since launch, with $970.9 million on Monday. Its inflows on that day contrast with the outflows from competing products, such as Ark 21 Shares ARKB, Fidelity’s FBTC, and Bitwise’s BITB. However, IBIT’s performance was still enough to offset these outflows and ensure $591.2 million in net flow for Bitcoin ETFs. The product, which has over $50 billion in AUM, has pulled in more than $4.5 billion in inflows since April 22 and accounts for 51% of the value of all spot Bitcoin ETFs .

A substantial movement of Grayscale Ethereum has just occurred, signaling potential shifts in how large holders manage their assets. What Happened with the Grayscale Ethereum Wallet? According to data tracked by blockchain analytics platform Arkham, a specific crypto wallet identified as potentially linked to Grayscale initiated a significant transfer. Roughly an hour ago, this wallet moved 3,909 ETH to Coinbase Prime. At the time of the transfer, this amount of Ethereum was valued at approximately $6.95 million. Here’s a quick breakdown: Sender: Wallet potentially linked to Grayscale Recipient: Coinbase Prime Amount: 3,909 ETH Approximate Value: $6.95 million (at the time of transfer) Source: Arkham data Grayscale is one of the largest digital asset managers, known for its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE). Movements from wallets associated with such major players are always noteworthy as they can provide insights into institutional sentiment and strategy. Why Transfer to Coinbase Prime? The destination of the transfer is equally important. Coinbase Prime is Coinbase’s platform specifically designed for institutional clients. It offers advanced trading features, secure custody solutions, and prime brokerage services tailored for large-scale investors and corporations. Moving assets to Coinbase Prime could indicate several potential actions: Preparation for trading (buying or selling). Transferring assets for secure custody under Coinbase’s institutional-grade infrastructure. Internal restructuring or rebalancing of assets within Grayscale or an affiliated entity. Meeting redemption requests, although this is less common for ETH trusts compared to GBTC historically, it’s a possibility depending on the specific fund structure. The precise reason for this specific transfer isn’t immediately clear from the transaction data alone, adding a layer of mystery to the movement. Potential Impact on ETH Price Whenever a large amount of an asset like Ethereum moves, especially to an exchange platform like Coinbase Prime, market participants naturally wonder about the potential impact on its price. At the moment, the ETH price is trading around $1,750.16, reflecting a decrease of 2.65% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. A transfer of this size to an institutional trading platform *could* signal potential selling pressure if the intent is to offload assets onto the market. However, as mentioned, it could just as easily be a move for custody or internal management that has no immediate impact on market supply. It’s crucial not to jump to conclusions based on a single transaction. While a $6.95 million transfer is significant for an individual, it’s a relatively small amount compared to Ethereum’s overall market capitalization (which is in the billions). Nevertheless, tracking such large crypto wallet movements is a key part of understanding the broader flow of institutional crypto capital. Following Institutional Crypto Wallet Activity Tracking the on-chain movements of large players is a fascinating aspect of the crypto market. Platforms like Arkham, Etherscan, and others allow anyone to observe these transactions, providing transparency that isn’t always available in traditional finance. Key things to watch for after such a transfer include: Are the funds subsequently moved from Coinbase Prime to other wallets or exchanges? Is there a noticeable increase in ETH selling volume on Coinbase or Coinbase Prime? Are there follow-up transfers from other Grayscale-linked wallets? Does the market react significantly in the hours or days following the transfer? Understanding institutional crypto movements helps piece together the larger market narrative beyond just price charts. Conclusion: Keeping an Eye on Grayscale Ethereum The transfer of 3,909 ETH from a wallet associated with Grayscale to Coinbase Prime is a notable event in the institutional crypto space. While the exact purpose remains unconfirmed, it highlights how major asset managers are actively managing their digital holdings. Whether this move precedes trading activity or is purely for operational reasons, it serves as a reminder of the constant flow of capital within the Ethereum ecosystem and the increasing sophistication of institutional participation. Market participants will be watching closely for any subsequent movements or market reactions that might shed more light on the intent behind this significant transfer.

With massive ROI rumors flying around and new projects causing waves before even launching, early access has become the golden ticket. Projects like Fartcoin, Tutorial, Fwog, Moo Deng, Just a Chill Guy, WHY, and SPX6900 are heating up — but one feline coin, you-know-who, is clawing its way to the top. Meme coin madness isn’t just about fun branding anymore. It’s about innovation, scarcity, and timing. These coins are leveraging playful narratives, viral engagement, and community power to offer serious potential gains. And if recent history has taught anything, it’s this — those who pounce early tend to be the ones walking away with their bags full. Among all the chaos, whispers of a cat-themed coin — let’s just say it’s sleek, stealthy, and stirring a storm on Trollercat.com — are echoing through the crypto alleys. This article breaks down why meme coins like WHY, Fwog, and the inescapable Troller Cat are catching fire among analysts and crypto chasers alike. But before we dive in, let’s talk about why Troller Cat’s whitelist might just be the smartest click you’ll make all year. 1. Troller Cat ($TCAT) Whitelist: Your Ticket to Early Access Glory Troller Cat’s whitelist is closing in fast, and the countdown is very real. Those who sign up now will gain exclusive access to the upcoming presale launching on May 2nd, 2025, at 6 PM UTC. What does that mean for potential buyers? Simple. First dibs at what many in the space are calling 2025’s most anticipated meme coin launch. With talks of a 10,000% ROI swirling, missing this could be one of those tales you’ll tell in regret. Whitelist access grants users an edge in securing tokens at the lowest possible entry point before the masses pour in. It’s not just early — it’s strategic. The chance to lock in prices before the floodgates open often means those who whitelist see the highest upside when prices moon. With Trollercat.com buzzing and registrations surging, this whitelist isn’t just another form — it’s a financial strategy. Why Whitelisting Troller Cat May Be Your Smartest Move of 2025 There’s a reason crypto analysts and alpha groups are whispering about Troller Cat. The project is building serious momentum, but it’s the whitelist advantage that has tongues wagging. Early participants won’t just get a head start; they may also unlock access to future staking rewards, rumored to be highly generous to those entering at the ground floor. Even better? Rumors suggest a play-to-earn Game Center could soon launch under the Troller Cat banner, adding a deflationary twist to the coin’s design. Translation: Token supply shrinks while demand spikes — classic economics that could fuel rapid price increases. This isn’t just a coin; it’s an ecosystem in the making. And whitelisting now? It’s like holding the backstage pass to the biggest meme coin concert of 2025. 2. WHY ($WHY): The Meme Coin with a Message WHY isn’t just a meme coin — it’s a bold philosophical question wrapped in crypto flair. With its simple name and profound undertones, WHY has sparked curiosity across social media, helping it achieve viral traction in the memecoin universe. It doesn’t rely solely on gimmicks; instead, WHY invites its holders to ponder bigger meanings while participating in a thriving decentralized economy. The token’s branding aligns well with modern internet culture — edgy, minimalist, and self-aware. As influencers and content creators increasingly latch onto meme tokens with depth and irony, WHY finds itself in a sweet spot between satire and substance. Its ongoing roadmap teases interactive tools and community challenges designed to keep users engaged. 3. Tutorial ($TUT): The Learn-to-Earn Meme Marvel Tutorial might sound like a crypto course, but it’s a meme coin project that flips the script on traditional education models. Designed to integrate learning and earning, Tutorial gamifies crypto knowledge, making it particularly popular with newer investors seeking both fun and fundamentals. The coin is buzzing in online communities thanks to its user-centric approach. With rumors swirling about potential integrations with decentralized learning platforms and quirky in-app features, Tutorial’s trajectory could surprise even seasoned traders. The playful name, paired with its instructional twist, is a smart branding move that caters to Gen Z and Gen Alpha. 4. Fwog ($FWOG): Froggy Frenzy in the Memeverse Fwog is leaping into the meme coin scene with a splash of nostalgia and a quirky amphibious twist. Drawing inspiration from internet frog memes and vintage web culture, Fwog has charmed the crypto crowd with its ribbiting personality. It’s community-focused and consistently hosts quirky giveaways and frog-themed events, making it one of the most engaging tokens in 2025. Fwog isn’t just hopping on trends — it’s carving a unique lane with speculative utility in gaming and digital collectibles. Analysts are closely watching as this frog-themed favorite begins to gain traction with both memecoin veterans and newcomers. 5. Just a Chill Guy ($CHILLGUY): Laid-back Lambo Dreams Just a Chill Guy embraces the chill vibe of internet culture. Unlike the typical hype-driven coin, this project plays it cool — literally. With branding centered around zen memes, cozy aesthetics, and good vibes, Just a Chill Guy has cultivated a loyal fan base that prefers the slow-and-steady approach to meme creation. This meme coin is rumored to explore relaxation-based metaverse hubs and passive income utilities that match its calm branding. Think of it as a digital hammock for those tired of market chaos. That relaxed angle makes it highly shareable and trend-worthy on platforms like Reddit and TikTok. 6. SPX6900 ($SPX): Bull Market Energy in Token Form SPX6900 is the meme coin for the traders who live and breathe charts. Named in reference to the S&P 500 hitting astronomical levels, this token celebrates the bullish spirit of the market. With chart memes, laser eyes, and peak speculation energy, SPX6900 gives meme traders a reason to cheer every green candle. The token’s high-octane branding connects strongly with financial meme culture — think stonks, diamond hands, and moon missions. Backed by meme-savvy devs and community mods who pump out relentless memes, it’s no surprise SPX6900 has rocketed into trending territories. 7. Moo Deng ($MOODENG): The Meme Cow Goes Crypto Moo Deng is a hilarious, bovine-themed meme coin that milks humor for all it’s worth. With moo memes galore and a decentralized farmer vibe, this token grazes the fields of virality. Its unique name and marketing have helped it surpass the competition and draw in meme coin ranchers from across the web. From cow-themed NFT drops to moo-sical collaborations, Moo Deng’s roadmap is as wild as its community. The coin has gained traction, particularly in regions where meme culture and agriculture intersect, creating a unique fusion of offline and online appeal. 8. Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN): Comedy Gold on the Blockchain If there’s one coin that isn’t afraid to go full send on toilet humor, it’s Fartcoin. Fueled by flatulence and fueled by fun, Fartcoin is the kind of project that doesn’t take itself too seriously — and that’s precisely why it’s becoming a fan favorite. This gas-powered meme token has taken over social media with its crude but catchy branding. Fartcoin memes, NFTs, and lowbrow humor are lighting up the crypto corners of the internet, and the community is anything but silent (pun intended). Despite the laughs, Fartcoin’s devs are surprisingly serious about keeping the tokenomics tight. Conclusion Based on the latest research, Troller Cat whitelist coins are Troller Cat, WHY, Tutorial, Fwog, Just a Chill Guy, SPX6900, Moo Deng, and Fartcoin. Each brings its flavor of madness to the crypto space, but one name is clawing its way ahead of the pack — Troller Cat. With its whitelist phase ending soon and a presale on the horizon, Trollercat.com offers a rare opportunity for ground-floor entry. The rumors around deflationary mechanics, sky-high staking returns, and a 10,000% ROI are just the beginning. Missing this could be like ignoring Bitcoin at $1.

This move has sparked considerable discussion, particularly within the tech and labor sectors, raising questions about the future of work alongside technological innovation. Let’s delve into how Duolingo AI is reshaping its platform and the subsequent reactions. Duolingo Embraces Generative AI for Massive Expansion Duolingo recently unveiled a staggering launch: 148 new language courses. This announcement, made on Wednesday, signifies a monumental expansion, effectively doubling the company’s existing course catalog. What’s truly remarkable is the speed at which this was achieved. According to Duolingo co-founder and CEO Luis von Ahn, creating the first 100 courses took approximately 12 years. In stark contrast, nearly 150 new courses were developed and launched in about a year, thanks largely to the integration of generative AI . Von Ahn highlighted this rapid scaling as a direct benefit of their investment in AI and automation, stating it allows them to scale at “unprecedented speed and quality.” This acceleration in content creation is a key outcome Duolingo is touting from its AI-first strategy. The Controversial Side: Duolingo Contractors and AI While the launch of numerous new courses is a positive for learners seeking more language options, the timing coincides with significant backlash Duolingo is facing. The controversy stems from the company’s stated intention to replace human contractors with AI for certain tasks. An internal email from CEO Luis von Ahn revealed plans to “gradually stop using contractors to do work that AI can handle” and that future hiring would be contingent on teams being unable to automate their work further. This shift towards becoming an “AI-first” company, as described by Von Ahn, is presented internally as a necessity for scaling content creation to meet global demand. He argued that manual content creation “doesn’t scale” and that AI is crucial for getting content to learners faster. However, this perspective has been met with considerable criticism externally. What Does This Mean for AI Language Courses and Quality? The rapid development of AI language courses raises questions about quality and accuracy. In the past, building a single Duolingo course was a multi-year effort involving language experts and educators. Now, generative AI is playing a central role in the content creation process. Duolingo asserts that its AI and automation investments allow for both speed and quality, but some users remain skeptical. The backlash on social media isn’t solely about job displacement; it also includes user concerns about the quality of AI-generated content. Some users have reported encountering inaccuracies or lower-quality content they attribute to the increased use of AI within the app. These concerns highlight an ongoing debate in the AI space: balancing the efficiency and scalability offered by AI with the nuances and quality often associated with human expertise, particularly in fields like education and language. The Impact of AI Content Creation The situation at Duolingo serves as a prominent example of the disruptive potential of AI content creation . The ability to generate educational material at an unprecedented pace could democratize access to learning, offering courses in languages that were previously too costly or time-consuming to develop manually. The 148 new courses, primarily aimed at beginner levels, include features like Stories and DuoRadio, designed to enhance reading and listening comprehension. However, this efficiency comes with significant implications for the human workforce, specifically the contractors who previously performed tasks now being automated. The narrative from Duolingo focuses on the benefits for learners and the mission of making language learning accessible, while the reaction from users and the public often centers on the human cost and potential impact on content quality. Looking Ahead: More Advanced AI-Powered Content? Duolingo plans to continue leveraging AI for future content development. While the initial wave of 148 courses focuses on beginner levels, the company intends to launch more advanced content in the coming months. This suggests a deeper integration of AI across the platform, potentially impacting how lessons are structured, personalized, and delivered. The company’s commitment to being “AI-first” indicates that artificial intelligence will play an increasingly central role in all aspects of its operations, from content creation to potentially user interaction and personalized learning paths. The success of this strategy will likely depend on Duolingo’s ability to maintain high content quality, address user concerns about AI-generated errors, and navigate the complex social and ethical implications of automating roles previously held by humans. Summary: A Double-Edged Sword? Duolingo’s massive launch of 148 AI language courses demonstrates the immense potential of generative AI to accelerate content creation and scale educational offerings rapidly. This aligns with the company’s mission to make language learning accessible globally. However, the simultaneous decision to replace contractors with AI has sparked significant backlash, raising critical questions about job security, the value of human contribution, and the potential impact of AI on content quality. As Duolingo moves forward with its AI-first approach, the tech world will be watching closely to see how it balances innovation, user experience, and the societal implications of automation.

However, bulls have failed to push decisively above the $155 resistance zone, a key level that could open the door to a broader rally. While the current price action favors buyers, the failure to break higher suggests that a retrace may be on the table if momentum continues to fade. Related Reading: Chainlink Flashes Daily Buy Signal – Breakout Next? Top analyst Jelle shared insights on X, noting that Solana’s monthly candle “is not looking too shabby.” According to Jelle, SOL took out all the consolidation lows and still managed to close the candle back above those levels—a positive technical signal suggesting resilience and potential continuation. Still, traders remain cautious, with many watching the $155–$160 area as the next big hurdle. A confirmed breakout above that zone could signal a move toward previous highs, while continued rejections might trigger a healthy correction into lower demand levels. With global markets still dealing with macroeconomic uncertainty, the next few sessions will be crucial for SOL. Bulls must act quickly to defend current levels and reclaim higher ground if they want to keep the trend in their favor. Solana At A Pivotal Level Amid Market Uncertainty Solana is currently trading at a critical level that could serve as a major pivot point for either a strong bullish recovery or a continuation of the broader bearish trend. While global tensions and ongoing trade conflicts between the U.S. and China continue to weigh on investor sentiment, recent market behavior hints at a potential bounce. The broader crypto market has shown signs of resilience, and Solana has been one of the standout performers. Since early April, Solana has climbed over 58%, recovering significantly from its local low near $95. This upward movement has helped shift short-term sentiment, but the price now faces a key test at the $160 resistance level. A clean break and hold above this zone could open the door for a larger rally, potentially taking SOL toward its previous highs. Jelle’s optimistic analysis highlights that Solana’s latest monthly candle is showing strength. According to Jelle, SOL took out all the consolidation lows and still managed to close the month back above them—typically a bullish sign. This sets the stage for a possible retest of the $240 level, a target that aligns with historical resistance and previous price action. However, failure to clear $160 could lead to renewed selling pressure, especially if global macro conditions worsen. For now, bulls must defend current levels and aim for a breakout to maintain momentum. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates Against Bitcoin – Dominance Shift On The Horizon? Crucial Test At $160 Resistance Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $147 after several days of struggling to break above the recent high of $157. Bulls have maintained control in the short term, but momentum appears to be fading as price action continues to stall below the key $160 resistance zone. This level remains a crucial barrier that needs to be reclaimed decisively to confirm a continuation of the uptrend. To sustain the bullish structure and avoid a deeper retracement, SOL must push through $160 and target the $180 level next. A successful move above this range would not only restore confidence but could also set the stage for a stronger recovery in the broader altcoin market. However, the longer Solana fails to break higher, the greater the risk of a pullback. If bulls lose momentum and selling pressure builds, a correction into the $130–$120 zone becomes increasingly likely. This area has previously served as a key demand zone and could offer support if tested again. Related Reading: Ethereum Shows 4H Bearish Divergence – Can Bulls Hold $1,750?

According to sources familiar with the negotiations, Ripple offered between $4 billion and $5 billion, but Circle turned down the proposal, reportedly viewing it as undervalued. Crypto M&A Activity Heats Up This attempted acquisition comes during a surge in crypto-related mergers, acquisitions, and IPOs. With digital assets experiencing renewed momentum and investor enthusiasm, several major players are preparing to go public. Firms such as Kraken, BitGo, Gemini, and Bullish are expected to seek IPOs in 2025, encouraged by the current pro-crypto political climate under the Trump administration. Circle itself has shown public market ambitions. Earlier this month, it filed for an initial public offering (IPO) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, aiming for a listing on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ‘CRCL’. However, just days later, reports suggested that Circle was considering delaying the IPO due to economic uncertainty stemming from shifting U.S. trade policies. Similar caution has been seen with companies like Klarna and StubHub, which are also weighing the risks of an IPO delay. Ripple’s Strategic Playbook Ripple’s interest in Circle aligns with its broader acquisition strategy. Notably, Ripple recently agreed to acquire Hidden Road, a prime brokerage firm, for $1.25 billion. This acquisition underscores Ripple’s desire to expand its ecosystem through strategic purchases rather than public fundraising. Monica Long, Ripple’s president, made it clear that Ripple is not currently considering an IPO. In an interview with CNBC, she emphasized the company’s strong financial position: “We have billions in cash reserves. We don’t need to raise capital or increase market exposure by going public.” She added, “Companies usually IPO to raise funds or elevate their brand. We’re not in need of either right now.” The Stablecoin Race: Ripple vs. Circle Ripple has also entered the stablecoin market with RLUSD, signaling its intent to compete with Circle’s dominant USDC. However, it has a long road ahead. As of May 1, RLUSD had a market cap of $317 million, dwarfed by USDC’s $62 billion valuation, according to CoinGecko. Despite the setback with Circle, Ripple may still pursue a revised offer. The company’s long-term strategy seems focused on acquisitions and internal growth rather than going public, especially after resolving its long-standing legal battle with the SEC.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|USDC,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-04-30 23:20:05

These components are crucial for training and running the sophisticated AI models that are rapidly changing industries. As the global competition in artificial intelligence heats up, governments are increasingly looking at ways to manage the flow of this critical technology. Recently, a major player in the AI space, Anthropic AI, weighed in on proposed U.S. regulations concerning the export controls of these essential AI chips. Understanding the Proposed US Export Controls on AI Chips The U.S. government has put forward a framework designed to strengthen export controls on domestic-made AI chips. This initiative stems from concerns over national security and the desire to maintain the U.S.’s lead in the AI sector, particularly in the context of the US China AI race. The proposed rules, expected to take effect around May 15, aim to create a tiered system for countries receiving these chips: Tier 3: Countries already under existing restrictions, like China and Russia, would face additional, stringent limitations. Tier 2: Countries such as Mexico and Portugal would encounter export restrictions for the first time, including caps on the quantity of chips they could acquire without special review. Tier 1: Allies like Japan and South Korea would largely continue without new export restrictions. This framework represents a significant step in U.S. AI policy, reflecting a strategic effort to control the diffusion of advanced AI capabilities globally. Why Does Anthropic AI Support Export Controls? Anthropic AI, a prominent U.S.-based AI lab, has publicly expressed its support for the government’s framework. In a recent blog post, the company stated it “strongly supports” the Department of Commerce’s proposal. This stance aligns with the broader goal of ensuring the U.S. remains competitive in the AI landscape. The company acknowledges that controlling the flow of advanced AI chips is a necessary measure in the ongoing US China AI race, where technological superiority is increasingly linked to economic and national security. Unlike some other tech giants, such as Nvidia, which previously voiced concerns that the proposed export controls were “unprecedented and misguided” and could hinder global innovation, Anthropic AI sees these measures as fundamentally beneficial for U.S. interests and long-term AI development. What Specific Tweaks Does Anthropic Suggest for AI Policy? While broadly supportive, Anthropic AI isn’t suggesting the framework is perfect. The company proposed specific adjustments to refine the implementation of these export controls. Their suggestions aim to improve the effectiveness and control mechanisms of the policy: Lowering Tier 2 Chip Caps: Anthropic recommends reducing the number of AI chips that Tier 2 countries can purchase without undergoing a formal review process. Encouraging Government-to-Government Deals: To compensate for lower direct purchase caps and potentially mitigate risks like smuggling, Anthropic suggests encouraging Tier 2 countries to acquire chips through formal government-to-government agreements. This approach could provide the U.S. with greater oversight and control over where the chips ultimately end up. Increasing Enforcement Funding: Anthropic also highlighted the importance of robust enforcement. The company believes the U.S. government should allocate more resources to ensure these export controls are properly monitored and implemented effectively across all tiers. These suggestions indicate Anthropic AI’s focus not just on the existence of controls but on their practical execution and ability to achieve their stated goals. The Role of Export Controls in the US China AI Race The debate over AI chips and export controls is intrinsically linked to the intensifying US China AI race. Both nations are investing heavily in AI research, development, and deployment. Advanced AI chips are foundational to this race, powering everything from sophisticated language models to autonomous systems and advanced computing. By controlling access to the most advanced U.S.-designed and manufactured chips, the U.S. government aims to slow down the progress of strategic competitors, particularly China, in areas deemed critical for national security. Anthropic AI’s support for these measures underscores the view within some parts of the U.S. AI industry that maintaining a technological lead requires strategic control over key components like AI chips. This perspective views export controls as a vital tool in the broader geopolitical competition. Leadership Perspectives: Dario Amodei on Export Controls The position taken by Anthropic AI is consistent with the public statements of its CEO, Dario Amodei. Mr. Amodei has been one of the more outspoken leaders in the U.S. AI community advocating for stronger export controls on advanced technology. He has argued that such controls are necessary to manage the risks associated with powerful AI and to ensure responsible development, particularly in a competitive global environment. His advocacy highlights that the discussion around AI policy and export controls is not limited to government officials but is actively debated within the highest levels of the AI industry itself, with varying perspectives on the best path forward. Summary: Anthropic’s Pragmatic Approach to AI Chips Policy In conclusion, Anthropic AI supports the U.S. government’s proposed export controls on AI chips as a means to bolster national security and maintain U.S. leadership in the US China AI race. While endorsing the core framework, the company offers pragmatic suggestions focused on refining the rules for Tier 2 countries and enhancing enforcement capabilities. Their position, championed by CEO Dario Amodei, emphasizes the importance of strategic AI policy in managing technological competition. This dialogue between government and leading AI labs like Anthropic is crucial as the U.S. navigates the complex challenges of regulating critical technologies in a rapidly changing world.

The rules will also apply to energy firms that provide electrical capacity to mining pools and companies headquartered outside Russia. Mining Crypto: VAT Charges Incoming in Russia Per the Russian media outlet RBC , the plans are the brainchild of the Ministry of Finance. The ministry said it wants to clarify the procedures for taxing the lease of crypto mining equipment. The Bitcoin network hashrate over the past three years. (Source: Blockchain.com) It also said that it wants to create tax rules for firms that provide “computing power for mining” to non-Russian clients. The VAT charges will likely apply to real-time, monthly, or annual leasing bills and transactions. The ministry said that a lack of “clear explanations” in current legislation has left providers unsure about how to declare their activities. New Charges for ‘Mining Infrastructure Operators’ A Russian law that came into force in January this year obliges all industrial crypto miners and “mining infrastructure operators (MIOs)” to sign up to a national register. The register is managed by the Federal Tax Service (FTS) , which is still finalizing plans to tax crypto miners and MIOs on their annual profits. Per the most recent FTS data, published on April 1, 116 MIOs have signed up to the register, along with 606 industrial miners. Both the FTS and other government organs believe that many more companies are still yet to sign up to the register. Commodities and shipping groups seek sanctions advice on return to Russia https://t.co/jMq6CUDaXf — FT Europe (@ftbrussels) April 30, 2025 Some have suggested introducing criminal liability for companies that fail to comply with the new law. But the FTS has urged leniency and suggested that some firms still need time to adjust to the new system. MIO firms typically provide space, equipment, and other facilities for mining crypto in custom-made data processing centers. These centers range from small buildings fitted with cooling equipment and fans to vast, factory-sized facilities capable of housing hundreds of Bitcoin mining rigs. El Salvador is still purchasing Bitcoin even after inking a loan agreement with the IMF that required it to stop accumulating the token https://t.co/uK12i0n4v7 — Bloomberg (@business) April 29, 2025 Crypto Mining Hotels Still Popular Small-scale crypto mining “hotels” also operate nationwide in Russia, with smaller centers offering total capacities of around 14 MW, and larger “hotels” boasting capacities of 100 MW and above. Investors and mining pools from all over the world have paid Russian MIOs to house their mining rigs, although some pulled out of the nation following the outbreak of war in Ukraine in February 2022. Regardless, many non-Russian pools and investors remain active in Russia, keen to access cheap electricity and relatively low overheads. The Industrial Mining Association (a collective comprising Russia’s biggest industrial miners) claimed in 2024 that if Moscow legalized mining, it could expect to reap tax revenues of around 50 billion rubles ($612 million) per year. The veracity of these claims will soon be put to the test. Some miners filed declarations on the April 25 tax deadline, meaning the world could soon learn how much tax Russia’s biggest crypto miners are now paying on their profits. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov. (Source: CNN/YouTube/Screenshot) Minister Wants Crypto Miners to Help Russian Firms Avoid Western Sanctions Lawmakers have taken a guarded stance. Anton Tkachev, the First Deputy Chairman of the State Duma’s IT Committee, said that April 25 was the industry’s first real tax test. The Russian Finance Minister, Anton Siluanov, stated early last year that his ministry did not expect crypto mining tax incomes to be “significant.” Siluanov instead suggested that Moscow will look to use the tokens produced from mining as settlement tools in foreign trade deals. Russian firms are increasingly looking to make crypto-powered cross-border trade deals using Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) as they remain frozen out of USD-denominated trade.

44003915,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154267,1746056408,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Exciting Release: JetBrains Mellum, An Open AI Coding Model",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/jetbrains-mellum-ai-coding/,"In the rapidly evolving world of technology and development, the intersection of AI and coding is becoming increasingly significant. For those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, understanding the tools that shape the future of software development is key. A notable step in this direction comes from JetBrains, a company well-known for its comprehensive suite of developer tools. They have recently unveiled something particularly interesting: JetBrains Mellum , their first truly ‘open’ AI model designed specifically for coding. Introducing JetBrains Mellum: A New AI Coding Model JetBrains, the company behind popular integrated development environments (IDEs) like IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, and others, has made a significant move by releasing its own AI coding model , Mellum. This model, which was previously integrated into JetBrains’ commercial tools, is now openly available on the AI development platform Hugging Face. This move signals a commitment to contributing to the broader AI research and development community. Key details about Mellum: It’s designed primarily for code completion, helping developers write code faster and more efficiently by suggesting snippets based on context. Mellum is a relatively compact model, weighing in at 4 billion parameters. It was trained on a substantial dataset of over 4 trillion tokens. The training involved a cluster of 256 H200 Nvidia GPUs and took around 20 days. The model is released under the permissive Apache 2.0 license. Understanding the scale: Parameters roughly indicate a model’s complexity and problem-solving capacity, while tokens represent the raw data it processed during training. JetBrains notes that a million tokens correspond to about 30,000 lines of code, giving a sense of the vast amount of information Mellum learned from. Why an Open Source AI Model Matters The decision by JetBrains to release Mellum as an open source AI model on Hugging Face is noteworthy. While many powerful AI models remain proprietary, making Mellum openly available fosters transparency, collaboration, and further innovation within the developer community. An open model allows researchers, developers, and enthusiasts to: Inspect the model’s architecture and training data (where permissible). Experiment with its capabilities. Fine-tune it for specific tasks or programming languages. Integrate it into various tools and workflows beyond JetBrains’ own ecosystem. JetBrains explicitly states that Mellum is designed for integration into professional developer tooling, AI-powered coding assistants, and research on code understanding and generation. Its open nature also makes it suitable for educational purposes and fine-tuning experiments. Focus on Code Completion AI Unlike larger, more general-purpose AI models that can write essays or generate images, Mellum has a specific focus: code completion AI . This specialization allows the model to be highly optimized for the task of predicting and suggesting code snippets within an IDE or code editor. This is a core function of modern development environments and can significantly boost developer productivity. However, JetBrains is clear that the base Mellum model requires fine-tuning before it can be effectively used. They have provided some fine-tuned examples for Python, but these are intended for evaluation and estimation of potential capabilities, not for production deployment. This highlights that while the core model is open, practical application still requires effort to adapt it to specific needs and contexts. Implications for AI Development Tools and Security The release of Mellum contributes to the growing landscape of AI development tools . As AI becomes more integrated into the software development lifecycle, tools like Mellum will become essential for developers. They promise increased speed and efficiency, but also introduce new considerations, particularly regarding security. AI-generated code, while helpful, is not immune to vulnerabilities. A survey from late 2023 by Synk indicated that over 50% of organizations frequently encounter security issues with AI-produced code. JetBrains acknowledges this, noting that Mellum’s suggestions may reflect biases present in the public codebases it was trained on and won’t necessarily be secure or free of vulnerabilities. Developers must still apply rigorous testing and security practices when using AI-assisted coding. Despite the challenges, JetBrains sees this release as a starting point. Their goal isn’t necessarily generality but focus and contribution to the community. They hope Mellum will spark meaningful experiments and collaborations. In conclusion, JetBrains’ release of Mellum as an open AI coding model is a significant development for the software industry. By focusing on code completion AI and making the model available on Hugging Face, they are contributing to the ecosystem of AI development tools and fostering open research. While challenges like fine-tuning and security require attention, JetBrains Mellum represents a valuable resource for developers and researchers exploring the future of AI-assisted coding.

The May 7, Ethereum Pectra upgrade could boost investor sentiment, but ETH’s price action shows investors are still hesitant to open new positions. Ether ( ETH ) has been trading below $1,900 since March, leading investors to question whether the failed attempt to reclaim $4,000 in December 2024 signaled the end of an era for the leading altcoin. Concerns continue to mount as derivatives market data shows that professional traders remain cautious about ETH’s price outlook. ETH monthly futures should trade at a premium of 5% or more compared to spot markets to compensate for the longer settlement period, but this indicator has held below the neutral threshold. Ether 3-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas.ch Part of the lack of enthusiasm stems from disappointment with the United States government, as Ether was classified alongside other altcoins in the “Digital Asset Stockpile” Executive Order on March 6. The Trump administration decided that only Bitcoin ( BTC ) was significant enough to be included in its own “Strategic Reserve.” In practical terms, altcoins already held by the government could be retained, but not newly acquired. Ether's market cap falls below its top four rivals For the first time ever, in April 2025, Ether’s market capitalization dropped below the combined value of its four largest competitors: Solana ( SOL ), BNB, Cardano ( ADA ), and Tron ( TRX ). Ether market cap vs. the sum of SOL, BNB, ADA, TRX. Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph After rebounding from lows near $1,400, Ether’s total market capitalization now stands at $217 billion, which is enough to surpass the combined value of its four main competitors. However, unless Ether consistently outperforms these rivals, sentiment is unlikely to improve. Some traders have high hopes for the upcoming ‘Pectra’ network upgrade , but current derivatives data does not reflect a bullish outlook. Ether’s decline has also coincided with weak demand for the Ethereum spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. Institutional interest was lacking, despite ETH’s price rising from $2,400 to $4,000 between October and December 2024. In contrast, Bitcoin ETFs saw assets more than double, growing from $50 billion in October 2024 to $110 billion currently. Ethereum leads in TVL, but there’s a catch Although Ethereum remains dominant in terms of total value locked (TVL), it has struggled to match Solana’s integrated user experience or Tron’s dominance in the stablecoin sector . Traders appear uninterested in Ethereum’s higher decentralization or improved security, especially for activities involving frequent deposits and withdrawals, where layer-2 solutions provide limited benefits. The absence of demand for leveraged bullish ETH positions does not necessarily mean that professional traders expect further price declines. If whales and market makers were unwilling to offer downside protection, this would be reflected in the ETH options markets, signaling increased risk of a market downturn. ETH 30-day options skew (put-call) at Deribit. Source: Laevitas.ch Contrary to some expectations, put (sell) options are trading at levels similar to call (buy) options. Notably, professional traders are now more comfortable with downside risks than they were two weeks ago. While ETH derivatives are not signaling strong bullish sentiment, they also do not suggest that professional traders are worried about further declines at current price levels. Related: 3 Ethereum charts flash signal last seen in 2017 when ETH price rallied 25,000% There is a chance that the upcoming ‘Pectra’ network upgrade could positively affect Ether’s price. Scheduled for May 7, this event might renew investor interest in the project by closing the gap with some of its competitors. Staking mechanisms designed for institutional investors could result in more ETH being locked in validator nodes, reducing the circulating supply. Historically, Ethereum upgrades have often been associated with brief spikes in ETH’s price.

Analyst Ali Martinez tells his 136,500 followers on the social media platform X that XRP can surge as high as 30% from current levels after breaking out of an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. The structure is typically considered bullish as it suggests that buyers are ready to step in without waiting for the asset’s price to revisit recent lows. “XRP looks to be breaking out of an inverse head and shoulders pattern, with a potential upside target between $2.70 and $2.90.” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, XRP is worth $2.23. Looking at the top memecoin Dogecoin, Martinez says that DOGE needs to recover a key price level to gather momentum and trigger a potential rally toward its record high. “If Dogecoin DOGE can secure a monthly close above $0.20, it could pave the way for a rally toward its all-time high of $0.74. Such a breakout would signal strong bullish momentum and potentially attract increased investor interest.” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, DOGE is trading for $0.173. Turning to the layer-1 protocol Solana, Martinez believes that SOL is forming a large bullish continuation pattern that could send the altcoin to an astronomically high price target above $3,500. “Zooming out, Solana SOL appears to form a textbook-perfect cup and handle pattern!” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, SOL is trading at $145. As for the fellow layer-1 protocol Cardano ( ADA ), the trader says the altcoin needs to take out the diagonal resistance of a descending channel to spark new rallies. A descending channel suggests that an asset is in a downtrend as its price prints lower highs and lower lows. “Cardano ADA is approaching a major test at $0.74. A breakout above this level could pave the way for a move toward $0.88.” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, ADA is worth $0.694.

XRP, Optimism, Sei, and Ethereum Are Gaining Fast",https://thecoinrise.com/early-2025-momentum-xrp-optimism-sei-and-ethereum-are-gaining-fast/,"Crypto markets are showing fresh momentum in Q2 2025, and several key altcoins are leading the charge. XRP , Optimism (OP) , Sei (SEI) , and Ethereum (ETH) are all gaining attention for their bullish setups, institutional signals, or unique roles in the evolving blockchain ecosystem. As capital flows into well-positioned projects, traders and analysts alike are turning their focus to early indicators of breakout potential. Ethereum and XRP Continue to Lead Ethereum (ETH) is trading near $1,739 , supported by whale accumulation, healthy RSI levels, and bullish crossovers. Momentum is being driven by surging activity in AI-related tokens and a spike in on-chain volume. Forecasts for Ethereum’s price path in 2025 remain optimistic, with upside targets between $2,500 and $2,700 in the months ahead. XRP , currently around $2.15 , is benefiting from increased institutional access after the recent approval of XRP futures ETFs. Technical setups point toward a possible move beyond the $2.45 resistance zone, which could trigger renewed inflows from both retail and institutional investors. Optimism (OP) and Sei (SEI) Quietly Position for Growth Optimism (OP) remains one of Ethereum’s most critical Layer 2 scaling solutions. Although recent updates have been sparse, the project continues to evolve its ecosystem. With prices stable and real-time trades near $3.25 , OP is viewed as undervalued by many long-term holders awaiting a broader L2 resurgence. Sei (SEI) is maintaining momentum as a fast-growing infrastructure chain focused on trading and performance. Though lacking headline news recently, its real-time value around $0.29 reflects consistent market confidence. Analysts expect SEI to play a more visible role if demand for scalable, low-latency platforms increases.

These AI agents can browse products, make purchases, and handle payments on behalf of users, streamlining the online shopping experience.​ The AI agents will harness the latest technology introduced by some of the biggest tech companies, such as Visa, which collaborates with Microsoft, OpenAI, and Anthropic to realize this vision. Visa’s new system, Visa Intelligent Commerce, will enable consumers to assign an AI agent to perform tasks, like booking a vacation, making a grocery order, or finding a fashionable outfit — and do so within a budget and according to personal tastes. Jack Forestell, Visa’s Chief Product and Strategy Officer, said that just as the shift from physical to digital retail had accelerated, the transition to digital-first commerce was underway. The pilot program is set to launch this year, with a full rollout expected by 2026. Changing shopping habits force advertising shifts Visa CEO Ryan McInerney says AI agents will soon eliminate outdated forms of advertising. Instead of being influenced by flashy banners or social media hype, digital assistants will prioritize data, user behavior, reviews, pricing, and peer preferences to guide purchasing decisions. With AI in the driver’s seat, businesses can no longer rely solely on polished marketing campaigns to reach consumers. To stay competitive, they must deliver genuine value, meet real needs, and stand out in AI-driven recommendation engines. Experts say this change will force businesses to provide value and quality rather than compete for attention. McInerney said on Bloomberg TV that a seismic shift in advertising was coming, predicting it would become more personalized, data-driven, and likely more nuanced. In other words, AI agents could be the new gatekeepers between brands and buyers. Visa has already spent over $3 billion on AI and data infrastructure in the last 10 years alone, The company is leveraging AI not just to make shopping better but to make it easier and more secure to pay. Powered by Visa technology, these AI agents can securely and confidentially get access to someone’s payment credentials and make transactions with a provider rapidly and without any inconvenience. With Visa’s advanced systems , consumers will retain full control—setting purchase limits, approving transactions, and monitoring their spending in real-time. Outside of the U.S., Visa also considers opportunities in high-growth economies such as India. The company is also negotiating investment with local AI startups to expand its footprint and serve users in other regions better. Rivals such as Mastercard and PayPal are also moving into AI shopping. However, Visa is betting its partnerships and early investments will give it a solid lead in one of the fastest-evolving areas of payments. Visa leads the shift to AI-driven commerce The emergence of AI shopping agents heralds a new era in how people shop and companies sell. Instead of hours of searching online, people will tell an AI what they want, and the agent will handle all the work. It will find the best deals, compare quality, check reviews, and even handle payments. For customers, it equates to saving time while seeing better results. For brands, that means finding new ways of reaching and retaining customers. Visa is wagering that AI-enabled commerce will be the next normal. It sets itself up to control the whole process, from discovering products to receiving the payment. McInerney said that payments were certain to evolve to support these changes and added that Visa was looking forward to the role it would play in making it happen.

Charts Say It’s Possible,https://cryptonews.com/news/can-these-3-tokens-really-hit-1-charts-say-its-possible/,"Meme coins are heating up again – and the charts are flashing green. Several top tokens are now teasing breakout potential, backed by rising momentum and growing community hype. As crypto regains its spotlight in both tech and finance, these low-cost contenders are catching serious attention. Let’s dive into three sub-$1 meme coins that could be gearing up for a major move – and possibly a run to that elusive $1 milestone. Dogecoin ($DOGE): Charts Suggest a New Breakout for the Canine King of Meme Tokens Dogecoin ($DOGE) continues to lead the meme coin movement with a $26.2 billion valuation reaffirming its position as the keystone of the memeverse. First launched in 2013 by Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer as a playful experiment, DOGE has transformed into one of the most recognized digital currencies globally. Unlike the newer generation of meme coins, Dogecoin enjoys extensive liquidity and established market presence. Its price frequently moves in tandem with Bitcoin, offering a level of stability that most meme tokens struggle to achieve. At present, DOGE is trading at $0.1757 after dipping 2% in line with the rest of the meme coin market. However, Dogecoin is now breaking out of a descending wedge — a classic technical pattern associated with bullish reversals, which you can see in the diagonal falling support and resistance lines from November to April. With a Relative Strength Index (RSI) reading of 54, DOGE is looking to rally again. With a few market rallies expected in May the token’s supporters are eyeing a move toward $0.48 — representing a potential 173% return from current levels. Adoption trends remain strong, too. Tesla continues to accept DOGE for select transactions, while platforms like PayPal and Revolut have introduced DOGE into their payment systems, reinforcing its growing utility. MIND of Pepe ($MIND): Fusing AI Innovation With Meme Culture MIND of Pepe ($MIND) blends viral meme appeal with emerging AI technology, positioning itself as more than just another internet joke coin. While it draws aesthetic inspiration from the iconic Pepe meme, this token is backed by real utility. Token holders gain access to a suite of AI-powered tools — including a crypto oracle and automated sentiment bot — offering real-time analytics, market predictions, and trading signals. Monument. $MIND pic.twitter.com/pcAJjfbTLg — MIND of Pepe (@MINDofPepe) April 18, 2025 So far, the project has raised over $8.5 million in early funding rounds. For passive income seekers, staking $MIND offers attractive returns, with annual yields reaching as high as 267%. As artificial intelligence reshapes everything from finance to content creation, MIND of Pepe is carving out a niche at the intersection of fun and function. Stay connected with MIND of Pepe on X (formerly Twitter) and Telegram . Brett ($BRETT): The Meme King of the Base Network Like Pepe, Brett ($BRETT) is inspired by a character in Matt Furie’s Boy’s Club . Unlike Pepe though, Brett exists on Base — Coinbase’s proprietary Ethereum Layer 2 network. After months of downward consolidation, Brett has seen a powerful rebound, with the price currently stabilizing above $0.06311 after a strong breakout. The token recently broke through a long-standing falling wedge formation, peaking at $0.071 and signaling renewed optimism among traders. In the last week, Brett has advanced 33%. A brief sell-off is likely to nominally depreciate the price overnight, but if Brett gets to $0.08, it will have stronger support for a further sally. Backed by strong trading volume and improving sentiment, Brett looks poised for another leg higher, with $0.10 within reach — and if market enthusiasm intensifies, a longer-term move toward $1 remains a possibility.

SOL futures open interest hit $5.75 billion on April 30, showing strong institutional interest. With rising DEX volumes and a $9.5 billion TVL, SOL could rally to $200 before a potential spot ETF approval on Oct. 10. Solana’s native token, SOL ( SOL ), fell 4% between April 29 and April 30 after failing to sustain the $150 level. Despite this short-term decline, traders seem more confident as the $140 support remained intact for a whole week, an outcome that hadn’t happened in over two months. As demand for leveraged SOL positions reached near record highs on April 30, traders are now reconsidering the chances of a SOL rally above $200. Solana futures aggregate open interest, SOL. Source: CoinGlass SOL futures open interest climbed to 40.5 million SOL on April 30, marking a 5% increase from the previous month and nearing its all-time high. In dollar terms, this represents $5.75 billion in futures positions, ranking third in the cryptocurrency market and over 50% higher than the demand for XRP derivatives. This strong adoption of SOL derivatives points to growing institutional interest. Data shows increased demand for bearish leveraged SOL positions Traders often believe that increased demand for SOL futures signals rising optimism. However, since longs (buyers) and shorts (sellers) are always matched, a rise in open interest does not necessarily indicate a bullish outlook. To better understand leverage demand in SOL futures, one can look at the funding rate for perpetual contracts. ETH perpetual futures 8-hour funding rate. Source: Laevitas.ch Currently, the funding rate on SOL perpetual futures is negative, which shows more demand for bearish positions. The last period of moderate optimism ended on April 25 after a failed attempt to break above $156. The lack of bullish leveraged positions may be partly due to the 43% price gain SOL saw in the three weeks from April 8 to April 29. A $200 target for SOL may seem ambitious, but the token was trading near $195 in mid-February, even after decentralized application volumes had dropped by 80% from their January peak. While Solana has faced criticism for its heavy reliance on memecoins, there is more to the network than just speculation on new tokens. Total value locked (TVL) on Solana Network, USD. Source: DefiLlama Solana ranks second in total value locked (TVL), with $9.5 billion in deposits, including liquid staking , collateralized loans, automated yield platforms, and synthetic derivatives. Several Solana decentralized applications are among the top fee earners, with Meteora collecting $19.1 million in seven days, followed by Pump-fun with $18.6 million and Juto with $14.6 million. Solana network dominates volumes on decentralized exchanges Since April 14, Ethereum’s average base layer transaction fee has been $0.65 or less, yet Solana’s decentralized exchanges have seen nearly 90% higher trading volumes. Even when including the entire Ethereum layer-2 ecosystem, Solana led the past week with $21.6 billion in decentralized exchange activity. Decentralized exchange volumes, 7-day market share. Source: DefiLlama Positive highlights from the Solana network include an 87% weekly increase in Raydium’s volumes and a 58% rise in Meteora activity. So, even if demand for bullish leveraged positions stays flat, SOL’s price could eventually reflect the improved onchain metrics.

Analysts believe the final deadline for the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s decision is Oct. 10, with a 90% chance of approval. Still, SOL might rally above $200 before this event, as the network is well-positioned to attract new retail investors.

XRP, MATIC, Sei, and Arbitrum Offer Potential Upside",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/will-ethereum-fuel-the-next-big-move-xrp-matic-sei-and-arbitrum-offer-potential-upside/,"The cryptocurrency market is eyeing Ethereum (ETH) as a potential driver of broader altcoin momentum. With Ethereum hovering near $1,739 and maintaining bullish indicators, investors are closely watching correlated moves in assets like XRP , Polygon (MATIC) , Sei (SEI) , and Arbitrum (ARB) . All are showing varying degrees of promise—and as May begins, analysts expect an uptick in volatility and opportunity. Ethereum’s Setup and Ripple Effects Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading around $1,739 , following a strong April marked by whale accumulation and rising demand in AI-related tokens. Technical signals like a recent golden cross and a neutral RSI support the view that ETH may soon break past key levels toward $2,500 . Reduced transaction fees and on-chain activity growth are adding to the bullish case. Ethereum’s strength tends to spill over into Layer 2 ecosystems and select altcoins, making this a key moment for projects directly or indirectly linked to its growth. Altcoins to Watch: XRP, MATIC, SEI, and ARB XRP , trading at approximately $2.15 , is riding high on ETF-driven momentum. With the U.S. approval of XRP futures ETFs and upcoming launches on CME Group’s platform, institutional interest is spiking. Traders are watching for a breakout past $2.45 , which could lead to extended rallies. Polygon (MATIC) continues to benefit from Ethereum’s momentum. Though it’s seen consolidation recently, 2025 price projections remain bullish with expectations tied to post-halving trends. With real-time pricing between $1.02–$1.04 , MATIC remains a key player among scalable Ethereum-aligned solutions. Sei (SEI) , despite a quieter news cycle, is maintaining stable price levels. It continues to build core infrastructure, especially in the trading and finance layer. Market watchers suggest SEI could see renewed action as Layer 1 narratives heat up in Q2. Arbitrum (ARB) , trading around $0.35 , faces a more uncertain outlook. It recently dropped sharply after exiting Nvidia’s AI Accelerator program, triggering concern among investors. Still, if sentiment around Layer 2s improves, ARB could find renewed strength off its current support levels.

The pattern indicates that SOL is coiling up, potentially preparing for a significant move once a breakout occurs. This period of sideways trading isn’t without significance. Historically, such consolidation phases can act as a prelude to sharp breakouts or breakdowns. Traders are now closely watching for volume spikes or candlestick signals that could hint at the next major trend. Current Market Context: Why Solana Consolidation Matters GemXBT emphasized that key support lies below the current price, around the $146 level, which has acted as a crucial buffer, preventing further declines and helping to maintain short-term stability. On the upside, immediate resistance is forming near $150, a level that has previously halted bullish advances. This resistance zone is now being closely monitored, as a breakout above it could trigger a stronger upward push. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Holding Strong Above $150 — Breakout Zone In Play GemXBT further elaborated on the technical indicators that support SOL’s current consolidation outlook. He noted that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) continues to hover in the neutral zone, reflecting the prevailing market indecision. This midpoint reading indicates that neither bullish nor bearish momentum is dominant at the moment, which aligns with Solana’s sideways price movement. The lack of an overbought or oversold signal suggests that a breakout in either direction is still on the table, making the coming sessions particularly crucial for confirming the next trend. In addition, GemXBT highlighted that the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has recently formed a minor bearish crossover, which could be an early warning sign of building downward pressure. Although the signal isn’t strong enough to confirm a trend reversal yet, it does raise concerns, especially if the $147 support level fails to hold. The Battle Between Bulls And Bears Based on GemXBT analysis, as Solana continues to consolidate between the $146 and $150 range, the market is at a crucial indecision point. After breaking out of the zone between $146 and $150, the next resistance to watch is the $164 level. If buyers are able to push the price past this barrier, it could pave the way for a rally toward the $211 level and beyond, marking a significant shift in momentum and market sentiment. Related Reading: Solana Price Enters Consolidation Trend Above $130 That Could End In A Breakout However, if bearish pressure intensifies and the $146 support gives way, it might trigger a sharper decline as sellers regain control. In that case, lower support areas such as $137 and $118 would come into play quickly. With both Solana bulls and bears eyeing these pivotal levels, the next decisive move is likely to set the tone for SOL’s short-term trend.

The banking system is criticized for inefficiencies and prioritizing the ultra-wealthy. Eric Trump emphasizes the growing role of cryptocurrencies in shaping the future of finance. Eric Trump, the head of the Trump Organization in the United States, the son of the country’s President, has sounded a dire outlook on the future of traditional banking. During an interview with CNBC on April 30, 2025, he explained that if banks fail to adapt to the use of cryptocurrencies, they will be obsolete within the next 10 years. According to him, the emergence of crypto is a threat to the banking sector. He complained about the contemporary financial system, stating that it is ineffective and cumbersome to use. Eric Trump noted that existing banks are expensive and tend to favor catering to high-net-worth investors. In his opinion, this broken system, when combined with slow transaction methods such as SWIFT, has led him into the realm of cryptocurrencies.

Robinhood’s Q1 results shared on April 30 show revenues fell 8.6% from the previous quarter to $927 million, topping Zacks analyst estimates by 3.16%. The company’s crypto revenue plummeted nearly 30% quarter-on-quarter to $252 million from the firm’s record-setting Q4 2024. The drop could be partly attributed to the Trump administration’s tariffs, which triggered an 18% fall in the crypto market cap over the quarter. Crypto trading volume on Robinhood also fell 35% over Q1 compared to the fourth quarter of 2024, which the firm attributed to a 10% drop in customer trades placed and a 27% fall in average notional volume per trade. Robinhood CEO Vladimir Tenev said on an earnings call that crypto trading volumes would continue to fluctuate but the firm is more focused on capturing as much market share as possible. Despite the fall from last quarter, Robinhood’s crypto revenue rose 100% from the same quarter a year ago, while trading volumes jumped 28% over the same period.

Source: Robinhood The firm also added $500 million to its now $1.5 billion buyback authorization program, aimed at boosting shareholder value and confidence in the firm’s financial health. The company has bought back $667 million worth of shares so far. Shares in Robinhood (HOOD) rose 1.51% in after-hours trading on April 30 to $49.85 since the firm disclosed its Q1 results, Google Finance data shows. Tenev said Robinhood’s $200 million acquisition of Bitstamp crypto exchange is still looking likely to receive regulatory approval in the middle of 2025, which would enable it to serve institutional investors in the US. Regulatory pressure also eased for Robinhood in Q1 after the Securities and Exchange Commission closed its investigation into the firm’s crypto business on Feb. 21. Crypto tokenization remains a key focus for Robinhood Tenev said Robinhood is still exploring integrating crypto tokenization into the company’s services. Tokenizing private equities is a “huge unlock” for both individuals and companies that can solve a lot of problems in secondary market transactions, he said. Related: Ripple $4B-$5B bid to purchase Circle rejected — Report “I think that will unlock a ton of economic value for the crypto industry in the US,” Tenev said. The Robinhood CEO previously said crypto tokenization could let investors buy tokenized shares in big-name private firms like OpenAI and SpaceX within minutes. “That's been kind of our primary policy objective in Washington when it comes to crypto,” Tenev said.

The accord was signed in Washington after months of tense negotiations, with uncertainty lingering until the final moments due to an eleventh-hour issue. This agreement establishes a joint investment fund for Ukraine’s reconstruction as Trump tries to secure a peace settlement in Russia’s three-year-old war in Ukraine. The correspondence is important to Kyiv’s efforts to improve its relationship with Trump and the White House, which was not good after he took office in January. U.S.-Ukraine pact seeks to cement support and economic recovery amid ongoing war According to a Treasury post on X, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Ukrainian First Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko were shown signing the agreement, which noted the deal “clearly signals the Trump Administration’s commitment to a free, sovereign, prosperous Ukraine.” Svyrydenko said on X that the accord allows Washington to contribute to the fund. Since Russia’s 2022 invasion, Washington has been Ukraine’s largest military donor, contributing over 64 billion euros ($72 billion) in aid, according to the Kiel Institute in Germany. Prior to the signing, Trump reiterated on Wednesday that the U.S. should receive something in return for its support to Kyiv, leading to the push for a deal focused on Ukraine’s abundant rare earth mineral deposits. In announcing the agreement, the U.S. Treasury pointed out that the U.S. has “provided significant financial and material support to Ukraine’s defense” following Russia’s invasion. A deal draft revealed that Ukraine won a removal of any obligation regarding reimbursing the U.S. for previous assistance, a point that Kyiv had vigorously fought. According to Ukrainian officials, the deal strengthened American support for Kyiv during the war. Still, the draft did not spell out any precise U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine, which was one of Kyiv’s top goals. In a separate move, Ukraine has been discussing with European allies the creation of an international force to help protect its security if a peace settlement is eventually reached with Russia. In a statement, the Treasury Department said the fund is in “recognition of the significant financial and material support that the people of the United States have provided to the defense of Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion” and will help “accelerate Ukraine’s economic recovery.” Minerals-for-aid deal revived after February fallout The current agreement appears to be the same as the original deal, which was set to be signed in February and indicated that Ukraine would put 50% of the proceeds from its state-owned mineral resources into a fund jointly owned with the U.S. The BBC reported that no security guarantees were outlined for Ukraine. The deal originated after President Donald Trump indicated Ukraine could give the U.S. access to its minerals in return for U.S. support of Ukraine in its ongoing war with Russia and described the potential agreement as a reimbursement for the U.S. aid. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled to the U.S. in February to reportedly sign the deal. However, he left the White House without signing it after an Oval Office meeting between him and Trump ended in a shouting match . Zelenskyy put out a statement days after the visit saying he wanted to end the war with Russia and that Ukraine was ready to sign the minerals deal. He saw it as “a step toward greater security and solid security guarantees.” Back in February, experts expressed concerns about the cost and production times associated with mining raw materials, and some said the mining might not result in a huge payoff. Benchmark Minerals Intelligence rare earths pricing analyst George Ingall noted that the minerals the U.S. desired at the time “won’t be used to make a profit in the next 10 or 15 years.” Ingall also said operationalizing a rare earth mineral mine takes up to $2 billion. While a minerals deal may take time to benefit the U.S. financially, obtaining the natural resources from Ukraine could help reduce the U.S.’ reliance on China and Russia to import the materials.

Analysts predict XRP could rise to new all-time highs again in 2025. XRP price dropped by 5% over the past 24 hours as US GDP data showed a shrinking economy . However, a strengthening market structure and investors’ growing hope for a spot XRP ETF approval in the United States suggest that the altcoin might revisit its April peak at $2.36 in the short term. XRP/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/ TradingView Technical charts currently show XRP ( XRP ) trading within a falling wedge pattern. A ""falling wedge"" is a bullish reversal chart pattern that comprises two converging trend lines that connect lower lows and lower highs. This convergence indicates weakening downward momentum. The pattern will resolve when the price breaks above the upper trendline at $2.40, and if this happens, buyers could target $3.74 next, representing a 71% increase from the current price. XRP/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/ TradingView The relative strength index (RSI) is above the midline, indicating that the market conditions still favor the upside. However, to sustain the ongoing recovery, XRP price has to first hold the support at $2.20 and then overcome the resistance between $2.80 and $3.00. Several analysts remain optimistic about the altcoin’s ability to rebound to all-time highs, with popular trader Dark Defender saying that the ongoing correction is part of an Elliott Wave pattern that will eventually see “XRP continue its climb to the top.” Fellow trader Allincrypto believes XRP is “heading to $19.27” based on a breakout from a falling wedge pattern. “Where we are pulling back is textbook perfect, and we had highlighted a falling wedge that was present on XRP that ultimately was just going for a continuation to $19.27.” Related: What are XRP futures and how to invest in them? Approval odds for an XRP ETF approval in 2025 rise Bloomberg senior ETF analysts said that the five spot XRP ETFs, including Grayscale, 21Shares, WisdomTree, Bitwise, Canary, and Franklin Templeton, have an 85% chance of approval after the change in leadership at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This is a significant improvement from their prediction over two months ago that set the chances of an XRP approval in 2025 at 65%.

Over the past week, the probability of approval has swung 17% in favor of the bullish masses, which was around 63% on April 23. XRP ETF approval odds on Polymarket.

The approval of these ETFs could unlock institutional capital, amplifying demand for the XRP. While approval timelines remain unclear, they would mark a step toward mainstream adoption for XRP.

This meteoric 412,055% surge underscores the crypto market’s potential for life-altering returns. Yet as XRP grapples with regulatory hurdles and market swings investors are hunting for the next breakout star. Enter Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a decentralized finance (DeFi) project currently in its fourth presale phase drawing crowds with its $0.025 token price and bold promise of exponential gains. Could this be the altcoin to replicate XRP’s historic rally? XRP 2017 Bull Run XRP’s climb from obscurity to prominence in 2017 was nothing short of remarkable. Starting at $0.006 its price soared to $3.84 by early 2018. This 63,900% spike turned modest investments into fortunes cementing XRP’s place in crypto lore. However regulatory battles particularly the SEC lawsuit have since capped its momentum. Despite a partial legal win in 2024, XRP’s growth remains tethered to market sentiment and institutional adoption. Investors now seek alternatives with clearer paths to profit prompting a shift toward projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Takes Center Stage Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is commanding investor focus with its structured presale and practical DeFi model. Phase 4 is underway offering tokens at $0.025 with $7.2 million raised and 425 million tokens sold to 9,100 holders. The project’s buy-and-distribute system where platform revenue repurchases MUTM tokens for stakers ensures steady demand. Recently the team launched a dashboard spotlighting the top 50 holders, rewarding them with bonus tokens for maintaining their rank a move sparking excitement among participants. As phase 4 nears its close the urgency to join before the 20% price hike to $0.03 in phase 5 intensifies. Presale Gains and Post-Launch Potential Investors snapping up Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens at $0.025 are poised for a 20% gain when phase 5 kicks in at $0.03. The tokenomics guarantee a 140% return at the $0.06 exchange listing a figure rooted in the presale’s structured pricing. Looking further analysts project a post-launch price of $2.75 in 2025 fueled by the platform’s lending innovations and growing adoption. This translates to a jaw-dropping 10,900% ROI from the current price dwarfing XRP’s recent performance. The team is also finalizing a Certik audit of its smart contracts with results soon to be shared on social channels bolstering trust as the project scales. Unlike XRP which leans on institutional partnerships Mutuum Finance (MUTM) thrives on user-driven DeFi utility. Its dual lending model—peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer—caters to diverse crypto assets while mtTokens accrue interest for depositors offering passive income. The $100,000 giveaway, awarding $10,000 in MUTM tokens to ten presale participants, adds fervor to the already brisk phase 4 sales. With 425 million tokens already claimed, the window to secure tokens at this low entry point is shrinking fast, echoing the early days of XRP’s ascent when timing was everything. Echoes of XRP’s Golden Era Mutuum Finance (MUTM) mirrors the early allure of XRP’s 2017 surge, where early adopters reaped colossal rewards. While XRP’s path now wades through regulatory fog, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a clearer runway with its presale structure and DeFi focus. A $1,000 investment today could yield $2,400 at listing or soar to $110,000 if the $2.75 target hits in 2025. Don’t miss out—join the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale now to lock in tokens before phase 5 raises the stakes.

Bitcoin Seoul 2025 , Asia’s largest Bitcoin-focused conference, will take place from June 4 to 6, 2025, at two of Seoul’s most iconic venues: Signiel Seoul and SKY31 Convention. Following its successful debut in 2024, Bitcoin Seoul quickly established itself as a key fixture in the global Bitcoin conference circuit. The inaugural event featured leading Bitcoin thinkers such as Saifedean Ammous and Jimmy Song, and attracted thousands of industry professionals and community members to Seoul to exchange insights on Bitcoin’s evolution and future. Building on this momentum, the 2025 edition promises an expanded scale and a deeper examination of Bitcoin’s global trajectory. More than just a conference, Bitcoin Seoul 2025 will feature a multidimensional program spanning Bitcoin strategy, regulation, finance, policy, and real-world adoption. Amid the growing trend of publicly listed companies in Asia and Europe adopting Bitcoin as a treasury asset, executives who have led these initiatives—including from MetaPlanet and The Blockchain Group—will be participating in the event to share first-hand experiences from the corporate frontlines. Additionally, Dennis Porter, who spearheaded the Bitcoin strategic reserve movement in the United States, will offer insights into Bitcoin’s expanding adoption at the corporate and governmental levels. Highlighting real-world adoption El Salvador’s Mi Primer Bitcoin and Bitcoin Beach—trailblazers in national Bitcoin integration—will lead a special session titled “El Salvador Bitcoin Adoption Showcase.” The event will also welcome Bitcoin community leaders from around the world, including the United States, Australia, Hong Kong, Vietnam, and Indonesia, who will share firsthand experiences of community-driven Bitcoin adoption across different continents and regions. The 2025 program will feature: Bitcoin Policy Summit: Seoul Edition — Insights into regulatory trends and Bitcoin-related public policy Bitcoin Finance Forum — addressing institutional investment, Bitcoin treasury management, and macroeconomic perspectives; Global Bitcoin Community Assembly — A global forum for Bitcoin grassroots and community leaders In addition, attendees will be able to experience live Lightning Network payments at the on-site Lightning Market, showcasing Bitcoin’s real-world utility.

Public Day (June 6): Dedicated to Bitcoin finance, adoption stories, and infrastructure innovations, welcoming community members, builders, and enthusiasts. As institutional interest in Bitcoin accelerates following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States, Bitcoin Seoul 2025 positions Seoul as a key node in the emerging global Bitcoin finance ecosystem. Countries including South Korea, Japan, and Hong Kong are rapidly integrating Bitcoin-based financial products and treasury strategies — reflecting a broader shift in the global financial landscape. Bitcoin Seoul 2025 aims to capture this momentum and further elevate Seoul’s status as a leading hub for Bitcoin-driven innovation and dialogue. This year, dozens of domestic and international companies are slated to sponsor the event. Among them is Bithumb, one of Korea’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, recently ranked #1 in the Korea Exchange Brand Reputation Index, signaling strong market trust.

The analyst also revealed the price targets that DOGE could reach following this breakout. Dogecoin Price Poised For Breakout Above $0.17 In a TradingView post, Cryptokijker predicted that the Dogecoin price is poised for a breakout above $0.1790. The analyst revealed that the targets on this potential breakout are $0.1840 and $0.1920. He noted that the price at this level is showing a neutral-bullish structure after the recent breakout above the Previous Day Low (PDL). Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Dogecoin Is Repeating History – Here’s What Happened The analyst also highlighted a hidden bullish divergence spotted on the Relative Strength Index (RSI), indicating strength beneath the surface. This Dogecoin price prediction comes amid a massive accumulation of DOGE by whales. He noted that smart money has been accumulating heavily within the discount zone between $0.15 and $0.16, which supports this bullish bias. The analyst observed that the break of structure on the chart signals the start of a markup phase. He further remarked that the volume profile supports the accumulation-to-expansion transition. Meanwhile, the strong support confirmed at the $0.1760 zone aligns with previous discount accumulation, and the momentum building above the PDL suggests that the Dogecoin price could sustain this bullish momentum. Market participants will also be watching the psychological $0.2 level for the Dogecoin price on this potential breakout. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed that DOGE could rally towards its all-time high (ATH) if it can secure a monthly close above $0.20. The analyst remarked that such a breakout would signal strong bullish momentum and potentially attract increased investor interest. It is worth mentioning that crypto analyst Master Kenobi also recently predicted that the Dogecoin price could reach a new ATH by June. He stated that the foremost meme coin could hit as high as $0.9 on the rally to a new ATH. Other Factors That Support A DOGE Breakout Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade stated that a Dogecoin price breakout is expected soon, which will send the meme coin higher. This came as he noted that DOGE has been moving between different ranges, experiencing both false breakdowns and breakouts. The analyst added that the meme coin has now returned to its current range, setting the stage for a price breakout.

XRP, Sei, Solana, and Optimism Could Be the Keys",https://thecoinrise.com/is-2025-a-wealth-window-xrp-sei-solana-and-optimism-could-be-the-keys/,"As crypto markets rebound and April closes on a high note, traders are revisiting the idea that 2025 may offer a rare “wealth window”—a convergence of opportunity across key altcoins. Four tokens in particular are earning attention: XRP , Sei , Solana , and Optimism . From institutional moves to technical strength, these altcoins are drawing investor eyes for what could be a pivotal growth phase. XRP: ETF Momentum Sets the Stage XRP is riding institutional momentum, trading around $2.15 and holding strong above its April lows. The SEC’s approval of ProShares’ XRP futures ETFs , along with the upcoming CME Group listing, has reignited interest in the asset. Technical forecasts suggest a breakout past the $2.40–$2.45 range could send XRP toward $3.63 or beyond. Sei: Quiet Progress Could Pay Off Sei remains a low-cap Layer 1 chain with rising developer engagement. The platform is focused on high-speed trading and low-latency infrastructure—two major selling points for future DeFi ecosystems. While there’s no major update this week, continued development behind the scenes and low market saturation could position Sei for a surprise move as altcoin sentiment builds. Solana: ETF Approval Sparks Surge Solana (SOL) closed April with a 41% monthly gain, currently hovering between $145 and $150. A critical resistance level at $180 remains in focus. If broken, analysts forecast a jump to $221. What’s driving this momentum? Canada’s historic approval of a spot SOL ETF , which has increased institutional exposure and attracted long-term holders. With altseason narratives picking up, Solana could lead the charge. CLAIM YOUR POSITION — ROI TARGET: 5000%+ Optimism: Under the Radar with Upside Optimism (OP) , With continued development and rising transaction volumes across L2 platforms, Optimism could benefit from ecosystem-wide gains. Investors looking for high-upside infrastructure plays are still keeping OP on the radar. Why MAGACOINFINANCE Could Define This Cycle Amid these headline-grabbing projects, one altcoin is quietly gaining momentum from the ground up— MAGACOINFINANCE . What sets it apart? Community-led traction, strategic timing, and a capped token supply that drives early demand. Investors are quickly catching on, securing allocations while it remains in its earliest phase. As interest grows and visibility spreads across social platforms, MAGACOINFINANCE is being positioned as a serious altcoin contender for 2025. This isn’t just a trend—it’s a long-term entry window that serious investors are watching closely. In conclusion, XRP , Sei , Solana , and Optimism all present timely opportunities with catalysts that could align well with 2025’s broader growth narrative. But for those looking for new frontiers in crypto investment, MAGACOINFINANCE stands out as a potential defining story of the year—making now a powerful moment to pay close attention.

Bitcoin Seoul 2025 , Asia’s largest Bitcoin-focused conference, will take place from June 4 to 6, 2025, at two of Seoul’s most iconic venues: Signiel Seoul and SKY31 Convention. Following its successful debut in 2024, Bitcoin Seoul quickly established itself as a key fixture in the global Bitcoin conference circuit. The inaugural event featured leading Bitcoin thinkers such as Saifedean Ammous and Jimmy Song, and attracted thousands of industry professionals and community members to Seoul to exchange insights on Bitcoin’s evolution and future. Building on this momentum, the 2025 edition promises an expanded scale and a deeper examination of Bitcoin’s global trajectory. More than just a conference, Bitcoin Seoul 2025 will feature a multidimensional program spanning Bitcoin strategy, regulation, finance, policy, and real-world adoption. Amid the growing trend of publicly listed companies in Asia and Europe adopting Bitcoin as a treasury asset, executives who have led these initiatives—including from MetaPlanet and The Blockchain Group—will be participating in the event to share first-hand experiences from the corporate frontlines. Additionally, Dennis Porter, who spearheaded the Bitcoin strategic reserve movement in the United States, will offer insights into Bitcoin’s expanding adoption at the corporate and governmental levels.

Public Day (June 6): Dedicated to Bitcoin finance, adoption stories, and infrastructure innovations, welcoming community members, builders, and enthusiasts.

Remember hearing whispers about Arbitrum when it was just a concept, only to watch it climb to a multi-billion-dollar valuation while your portfolio stayed stuck? That kind of regret doesn’t just sting — it lingers. If you’re tired of being the one reading headlines after the winners have been crowned, this month could finally be your reset button. Right now, the best cryptos to buy this month aren’t about FOMO-driven hype. They’re about recognizing real utility, innovation, and projects that are still accessible before the doors slam shut. That’s where Qubetics ($TICS) steps in. Its presale is already a magnet for smart early adopters who see what’s coming. With the Qubetics presale crossing over $16.5 million raised, 510 million tokens sold, and over 25,500 token holders locking in their spots, the opportunity is screaming for attention. If you ever wanted to be early and right, it’s right here — but you have to act before the next stage hikes the price again. Missed the Earliest Wins? Qubetics Is Still One of the Best Cryptos to Buy This Month You know that gut punch when you realize you could have grabbed something at rock bottom but froze? That’s exactly what early community members of Qubetics are feeling good about right now. Those who locked $TICS during the whitelist phase got them at $0.01 when the presale kicked off quietly on September 29, 2024. Since then, the train hasn’t just left the station — it’s already hitting milestone after milestone. Multiple lower stages are long gone, but the best part? This best cryptos to buy this month opportunity isn’t out of reach yet. With the 32nd stage live and a price of $0.2093, you can still slide in before the next 10% price hike that hits after every seven days. Plus, there’s even a 10% discount available if you act now — talk about stacking advantages. A $1,000 investment at today’s price would give you approximately 4,778 $TICS. If Qubetics hits $1 after the presale, that’s $4,778 straight into your portfolio — a clean 377.76% ROI. But that’s just the conservative view. If $TICS climbs to $5, you’re staring down 2,288.80% gains. At $6, that’s 2,766.55%. Stretch it to $10 by mainnet launch? Now you’re in 4,677.59% ROI territory. And if $TICS hits $15? You’re sitting on a jaw-dropping 7,066.39% ROI. The Qubetics presale isn’t just a ticket to a token — it’s a shot at serious rewards. Beyond the numbers, what makes Qubetics irresistible is its real-world application, especially the QubeQode IDE. No coding background? No problem. QubeQode brings drag-and-drop blockchain functionality that startups, businesses, and even side hustlers can tap into easily. Imagine a fitness app that rewards users with tokens for milestones, or a small e-commerce brand launching loyalty points without hiring a dev team. Even a non-profit could build secure donor tracking with zero blockchain coding knowledge. It’s the kind of tech that bridges real-world need with blockchain power — making Qubetics not just another hype project but a real utility machine. That’s why those who are serious about catching the best cryptos to buy this month are locking in before Qubetics mainnet goes live in Q2 2025. Arbitrum Proved What Happens When You Bet on Real Tech When Arbitrum first dropped into the crypto space, hardly anyone outside the niche DeFi circles gave it a second look. But its early ICO believers secured it at a humble valuation, and then watched it explode as Arbitrum became the de facto Layer 2 leader on Ethereum. Those early-stage buys turned into some of the juiciest returns across the whole market. Arbitrum’s growth wasn’t luck; it was about delivering true scalability solutions at a time when Ethereum congestion and gas fees were pushing users away. It showed that when utility matches timing, massive growth is inevitable. Fast forward to today, Arbitrum is now a staple name across Web3. Its contribution to solving Ethereum’s Layer 1 bottlenecks has made it a key player, partnering across ecosystems and securing its spot among the market’s heavyweights. The wild part? Most people only woke up to Arbitrum after it had already printed its biggest gains. That’s the lesson here — getting in early on real innovation isn’t optional if you want life-changing returns. It’s about recognizing patterns before they become headlines. Don’t Miss Another Shot at a Breakout — Why Qubetics Is One of the Best Cryptos to Buy This Month If you’ve ever wanted to erase past regrets and actually move smartly, this is your moment. Qubetics checks every box: real-world application, strong community support, aggressive innovation roadmap, and the kind of presale figures that scream future potential. Early participants are already sitting on massive ROI projections even before the mainnet goes live, and the runway ahead is packed with catalysts. The best cryptos to buy this month aren’t the ones already sitting at billion-dollar valuations — they’re the ones like Qubetics, which are still affordable but loaded with upside.

Bulls Target $95K and Beyond,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-rally-incoming-95k/,"Bitcoin price is rising again above the $94,000 zone. BTC is showing positive signs and might aim for a move above the $95,500 resistance zone. Bitcoin remained supported above the $92,500 zone. The price is trading above $94,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $95,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears the $95,500 zone. Bitcoin Price Eyes Fresh Rally Bitcoin price started a short-term downside correction from the $95,250 resistance zone. BTC declined below the $95,000 and $94,500 support levels. The bears pushed the price below the $93,500 support. However, the bulls were active near the $93,000 support. A low was formed at $92,970 and the price started a fresh increase. There was a move above the $93,500 and $93,800 resistance levels. The price climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $95,195 swing high to the $92,970 low. Bitcoin price is now trading above $94,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average . The price is also above the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $95,195 swing high to the $92,970 low. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $95,000 level. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $95,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The first key resistance is near the $95,250 level.

Any more gains might send the price toward the $98,000 level. Another Decline In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $95,500 resistance zone, it could start another downside correction. Immediate support on the downside is near the $94,200 level. The first major support is near the $93,500 level. The next support is now near the $93,000 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $92,500 support in the near term. The main support sits at $91,200.

Since 2021, nearly 7 million cryptocurrencies have been listed on CoinGecko’s token tracking tool GeckoTerminal, and over half, or 3.7 million tokens, “have since stopped trading and are considered failed,” CoinGecko research analyst Shaun Paul Lee said in an April 30 report . “Alarmingly, the first quarter of 2025 alone saw the collapse of 1.8 million tokens,” he added, which is “the highest number of failures recorded in a single year.” It also comprises just under half of all failures and represents a quarter of all tokens launched since 2021. CoinGecko recorded tokens with at least one trade before going defunct and only Pump.fun tokens that graduated, or completed the token creation platform’s bonding curve. There are more crypto tokens than ever, but many are failing to survive in the long term. Source: CoinGecko Lee linked the recent token die-off to “broader market turbulence” after Donald Trump’s inauguration in January, which saw Bitcoin ( BTC ) hit a peak high but was followed by a sharp downturn in the crypto market. More crypto tokens used to survive Last year saw the second-highest number of token failures at 1.3 million, and in comparison, Lee said that the three previous years had a much lower attrition rate. Lee attributed the ballooning number of tokens and their failures to the token creation tool Pump.fun, “which simplified the process of creating tokens, leading to a flood of memecoins and low-effort projects entering the market.” Pump.fun went online in January 2024. CoinGecko’s report shows that last year had the largest number of new crypto tokens with over 3 million launched, compared to 2023, which saw just over 835,000. “Before the launch of Pump.fun in 2024, cryptocurrency failures numbered in the low six digits. Project failures between 2021 and 2023 made up just 12.6% of all cryptocurrency failures over the past five years,” Lee said. Prior to 2024, crypto token failure rates were relatively low. Source: CoinGecko Pump.fun’s graduation rate, where token trading moves off the site, has never been particularly high , with roughly 98% of tokens failing. The platform’s best-performing week so far was in November 2024, when 1.67% of memecoins moved on to the open market. Related: AI tokens, memecoins dominate crypto narratives in Q1 2025: CoinGecko CoinGecko founder Bobby Ong said in a March 6 report that memecoin investor interest appears to have cooled after a series of bad launches, noting the fallout from the Libra (LIBRA) token launch. Pump.fun had a weekly trading volume high after the launch of Trump’s memecoin on Jan. 18, but both crypto and stock markets were hit with extreme volatility starting in March following Trump’s threats of sweeping tariffs.

Investors are closely monitoring Cardano (ADA) , Sei (SEI) , and Aave (AAVE) , each demonstrating significant momentum. Meanwhile, MAGACOINFINANCE is emerging as a noteworthy contender in the early-stage crypto space. For those considering an investment of $9,430, these assets present compelling opportunities.​ Cardano (ADA): Approaching the $1 Milestone Cardano is currently trading around $0.99 , marking a 12% increase over the past week. This surge is partly attributed to a substantial $20 million ADA withdrawal from exchanges on April 24, a move often seen as a bullish indicator. Analysts suggest that ADA could reach $3 to $4 between March and May 2025, driven by market cycles and decreasing supply. ​ Sei (SEI): Steady Growth with Promising Projections Sei is trading at approximately $0.213 , with forecasts predicting a rise to $0.232 by April 30, 2025. The platform’s recent developments, including a V2 upgrade and enhanced user experience through account abstraction, are contributing to its positive outlook. Projections suggest that SEI could reach a maximum of $2.865 before the end of 2025. ​ CLAIM YOUR POSITION — ROI TARGET: 5000%+ MAGACOINFINANCE: Emerging as a Promising Contender While established altcoins continue their ascent, MAGACOINFINANCE is quietly becoming one of the most discussed early-stage projects in the space. Backed by a growing community and expanding exposure, MAGACOINFINANCE is carving out a unique niche that many investors believe could define the next cycle of innovation.​ Investors acting now can access an exclusive 50% bonus offer. This limited-time promotion allows early buyers to significantly boost their holdings and maximize potential upside. Use promo code MAGA50X during checkout to activate the bonus and secure a larger share ahead of the listing wave.​ Aave (AAVE): Strengthening Position in DeFi Aave is currently priced at $165.99 , testing a critical resistance level. A successful breakout could propel the price towards $224 . The platform has achieved a record $35 billion in net deposits , indicating growing confidence in its DeFi offerings. Additionally, Aave has initiated a $50 million buyback program , aiming to boost token demand and support price growth. Final Thoughts With Cardano , Sei , and Aave showing strong performance and MAGACOINFINANCE emerging as a promising early-stage project, a $9,430 investment could yield substantial returns.

This happened as sales fell, profit collapsed, and investors lost patience with Elon’s obsession with the White House. Board members contacted many top recruiting firms to begin the official search for a new CEO, according to The Wall Street Journal . Meetings were held behind the scenes. At one of them, directors told Elon he had to spend more time at Tesla , and that he should say so publicly. Elon didn’t argue. The company had just posted a 71% plunge in first-quarter profit. Elon told shareholders on the earnings call, “Starting next month, I’ll be allocating far more of my time to Tesla.” Days later, President Donald Trump thanked Elon during a cabinet meeting. “You know you’re invited to stay as long as you want,” Trump said. “I guess he wants to get back home to his cars.” Elon’s absence triggered leadership crisis inside Tesla No one knows if Elon was aware of the CEO search or whether his promise to return to Tesla made a difference. But some board members already picked a search firm. Elon didn’t respond to questions. The company hasn’t shared anything publicly. If a new CEO is named, it would be the end of Elon’s two-decade reign running the electric car maker. He gave up the chairman seat in 2018 but stayed in charge of everything else. The eight-person board also wants to add a new independent director. JB Straubel, the company’s co-founder, has been meeting big investors to convince them that Tesla isn’t collapsing. But Elon’s political shift came at the worst time. In 2024, Tesla’s car sales dropped for the first time in more than ten years. Price cuts destroyed profit margins. The Cybertruck rollout was a disaster. It became a joke on late-night shows for its design. President Trump with Elon Musk at the White House to talk up the company’s vehicles in March. Source: WSJ After Trump won re-election, Tesla’s value shot up to $1.5 trillion. Then it crashed to $900 billion. Elon texted someone last year that he was tired of nonstop work, especially after a Delaware judge rejected his huge pay deal. He reportedly said he didn’t want to be CEO anymore, but he was scared nobody else could push Tesla’s idea that it wasn’t just a car company but the future of automation and robotics. Elon also complained that even though he owns 13% of Tesla, he hasn’t been paid in seven years. The board made a new compensation committee to deal with that. More than 20 execs report directly to him, based on company records. Since the election, he’s mostly lived in D.C. and spent weekends at Mar-a-Lago. When he did talk to his staff, it was remote. Employees said the first time they saw him in months was at a March meeting streamed live. Tesla investors question leadership as product issues mount At first, employees were glad Elon was away because they said he micromanaged too much, per the Journal’s report . But things changed fast. Some workers wanted confirmation that Elon still believed in Tesla’s mission. In November, Mike Snyder, who leads the solar and energy team, told his staff, “It’s obviously been a turbulent and emotional season, I acknowledge that. I’d rather have Elon next to Trump than an enemy of Trump.” He told them Elon still responded to messages. “People concerned that Elon is not engaged or interested, I can assure you that’s not true.” Executives also reportedly say Tesla is now focused on artificial intelligence and robots. The company is pivoting away from its old growth model. The new Cybercab has no pedals or wheel. The Optimus robot is the center of Elon’s next pitch: a $30 trillion company. But the core EV business is falling apart. Instead of rolling out a low-cost model this year, Tesla made cheaper versions of existing ones. The Model Y got a facelift in March. Meanwhile, the company is telling investors that self-driving ride services are coming soon. Tesla plans to launch its ride-hailing app in Austin by June. Customers will be able to take driverless rides in Model Ys. That puts them up against Waymo and Zoox. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

It was priced at only $0.007125 during the presale. The project has raised more than $19.6 million in funding already. It shows that investors are becoming more and more interested. It is expected that the project will surge as much as 50% at the time of listing. Hence, a lot of investors are looking ta it as a golden opportunity to get explosive gains. Speculative plays tend to be more risky, such as memecoins like Dogecoin. However, Lightchain AI has a proper roadmap at its back. It also has increasing community support, which means that it is a more serious project that is more likely to continue building. Big whales are already loading up on the supply quietly and retail investors still have time to get in before Lightchain AI becomes a breakout success story. XRP Whale Movements Signal Growing Interest in Lightchain AI XRP whales have been becoming more and more interested in Lightchain AI (LCAI) . It is an emerging blockchain project that integrates artificial intelligence. LCAI has already raised more than $19.6 million in its presale. Initially, the tokens were available at a price of $0.00712. As a result of this, they attracted a lot of attention from investors. In fact, ETH whales are already holding over 5% of Lightchain AI supply. Lightchain AI is different from other projects as it follows a unique Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism. This means that nodes get rewarded for executing AI computations, and its Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) allows efficient AI tasks on the blockchain. Additionally, its deflationary tokenomics model, which burns a portion of tokens during transactions, creates scarcity that could enhance token value over time. XRP is continuing to build in the cross-border payments space. However, since whales are becoming increasingly interested in Lightchain AI , it shows that the trend is shifting to blockchain projects that offer actual real-world utility and innovative solutions. Why Lightchain AI at $0.007 is Chance You Shouldn’t Miss With its presale price of $0.007, Lightchain AI is a force to be reckoned with in the world of cryptocurrency by now. Tapcore has already received millions of dollars in funding and is now making a stir with its unique mix of blockchain and artificial intelligence. Developed with advanced scalability technology such as Sharding and Layer 2 solutions, Lightchain AI seeks to go beyond the limitations of current blockchain-based systems, delivering increased speed, efficiency, and automation enabled by artificial intelligence (AI). Lightchain AI’s Anticipated 50% Listing Surge– Market’s Next Game-Changer! Lightchain AI is positioned for a significant 50% price increase, solidifying its status as an emerging market disruptor. The successful presale fundraising of $19.6 million highlights strong market confidence in Lightchain AI’s long-term potential. With its listing on major exchanges approaching, this may be the final opportunity for investors to secure a position at a lower price before the anticipated growth. Notably, interest from XRP whales further strengthens Lightchain AI’s market presence, reinforcing its positioning as a key player in the blockchain space. Now is a strategic time to consider an investment in Lightchain AI . With its innovative AI-powered blockchain platform, this project is on track to become a major success story by 2025. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf Tweets by LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-01 03:00:00

Now, the search for the next explosive opportunity has intensified across the crypto space. However, a new altcoin powerhouse called RCO Finance has investors excited. Backed by a $7.5 million VC injection, RCOF is the go-to project for those looking beyond the Solana price and seeking early entry into the next major crypto breakout. While the Solana Price Consolidates, RCOF Steals the Spotlight with Explosive Growth The Solana price is down by 2.38% to $149.08 in the last 24 hours, and traders have begun looking for alternatives. Many analysts have predicted that the price might hit $200 in the long term. However, better opportunities with higher upside potential are emerging elsewhere. RCOF is now gaining serious recognition from institutions, and this crypto asset is fast becoming a household name. Smart traders know that the best way to ride massive gains is to follow institutional capital because when they move, the entire market follows. With over 200,000 members already joining the RCOF ecosystem and big money flowing in, retail investors are starting to realize the window of opportunity is closing. As the Solana price continues to dip, RCOF is setting up to create the next wave of crypto millionaires. Why Excitement Around RCOF Is At An All-Time High RCO Finance has made a powerful entrance into the crypto market, securing a $7.5 million injection from venture capitalists, an early signal of the project’s massive potential. But this is only the beginning. In just a matter of weeks, RCO has attracted over 200,000 users, sending shockwaves across the crypto space. The rapid adoption has left even established players like Solana struggling to keep pace, as investors rush to secure a position before the next major breakout. Even a future Solana price uptrend can not match RCOF’s potential at this point. For those still watching from the sidelines, this is precisely the problem. Since Stage 1, RCOF has already surged by 1,300%, fueled by growing investor confidence and the recent $7.5 million capital injection. And this may just be the prelude. Analysts are now projecting a potential 30,000% rally in the coming weeks as momentum accelerates and early backers double down on their positions. For savvy investors who already own RCOF tokens, there is still a huge chance to profit even more. The internal team has RCOF hitting $1 by the end of Q2, but many analysts argue this projection is overly modest given the project’s recent developments. With momentum building rapidly and investor sentiment turning overwhelmingly bullish, RCOF could be on track to far exceed current expectations. New Features Set to Drive RCOF’s Token Price Further RCO Finance is rapidly evolving into a full-suite investment platform, beginning with the launch of its AI-powered dashboard. This groundbreaking interface offers real-time analytics, smart portfolio insights, and dynamic visualizations, setting the stage for personalized AI guidance via Intel AI Chat. Building on that foundation, RCOF introduced Smart Portfolio Management, an AI-enhanced tool that breaks down asset allocations, market values, and growth trends in a visually compelling way. Investors can now track their portfolio health in real time across devices, gaining deeper insight into performance with highly interactive data visualization. To complete the experience, RCO Finance expanded into Multi-Asset Class Support and Custom Watchlists, giving users access to live data across crypto, stocks, bonds, FX, ETFs, and more. Interactive candlestick charts and live tickers provide full market transparency, while personalized Watchlists make it easy to track and respond to market movements. Now, beyond words, here’s what’s in it for everyday investors. The $7.5 million VC injection is proof that institutional money is now flowing into RCOF, and smart money never shows up late. At its current price point, this may be the last window before a major price breakout sends RCOF into a price range too high for everyday investors. Luckily for you, institutional interest is only just beginning, creating a small window of opportunity for investors looking to make it big in 2025. Those new 200k users have already secured life-changing profits, and this is an opportunity that any future Solana price uptrend can not offer. To further boost confidence, RCO Finance has undergone a complete and thorough audit by SolidProof , and saying it came out with flying colours is an understatement. This was one of the driving factors behind the 7.5 million VC injection, and you have a chance to join in on the action. At the time of this writing, over $17 million has been raised in the presale already, and this is peanuts compared to what is expected in the coming weeks. As more institutions buy into RCOF, the $1 price projection feels more and more realistic. Join the Presale Today At the current price of $0.13, RCOF tokens are a steal, and by next week, the value of this token could receive an initial push towards its true value. There’s no time to waste as institutions are accumulating tokens. Let’s also not forget that the beta platform is now live and traders are now enjoying state-of-the-art AI features. This platform is bound to improve with time. If you’re still watching, understand this: hesitation is the enemy of profit. RCOF isn’t just another token.

The CCI’s Proof of Stake Alliance (POSA) group argued in an April 30 letter to the agency’s Crypto Task Force lead, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, that staking is fundamentally a technical process, not an investment activity. “Staking isn’t niche — it’s the backbone of the decentralized internet,” the letter said. The letter responded to the SEC’s call for public input on whether staking and liquid staking, where crypto users lock up their tokens to earn more, should be regulated under federal securities laws. The coalition called for the SEC to support responsible inclusion of staking features in exchange-traded products (ETPs), and “avoid overly prescriptive rules that could freeze market structures and stifle innovation in the staking space.” The group argued that staking fails to meet the securities-defining Howey test definition of an “investment contract” as stakers retain ownership of their assets. Source: Crypto Council for Innovation They added that blockchain protocols, not a staking provider's efforts, determine rewards, and providers don’t deliver profits through managerial decisions like a company does. The letter requested that the SEC Issue principles-based guidance similar to recent SEC staff statements on proof-of-work mining. “In the past 4 months, we’ve seen more movement and constructive dialogue with the SEC than in the past 4 years,” the group said. “Now, the industry is stepping up with concrete principles to include in guidance — a reflection of this new collaborative approach.” Related: Ethereum ETF staking will have little impact without multimonth rally: Analyst The group argued that the existing securities disclosure regime is ill-suited for staking services, which are fundamentally technical rather than financial in nature. Big names in support of staking clarity The Proof of Stake Alliance includes several high-profile crypto organizations and companies, including the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), blockchain software firm Consensys, and the crypto exchange Kraken, which restored staking services in the US earlier this year. The SEC has yet to approve a crypto staking exchange-traded fund (ETF) and delayed the decision on allowing staking for Grayscale’s spot Ether ETF on April 14. In April, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart predicted that an Ether ETF that includes staking could come as soon as May .

After a modest recovery in recent weeks, ETH—along with the broader crypto market—is facing a critical resistance zone that could either spark a breakout rally or lead to deeper consolidation. Bulls must break through the $1,850–$2,000 region to confirm renewed momentum, but macroeconomic headwinds are making that task more difficult. Related Reading: Chainlink Flashes Daily Buy Signal – Breakout Next? Persistent uncertainty surrounding US-China trade tensions and global economic slowdowns continues to weigh on investor sentiment. While risk assets have shown signs of resilience, the environment remains volatile and sensitive to geopolitical developments. Within this context, large holders appear to be taking a cautious approach. According to data from CryptoQuant, whales took advantage of Ethereum’s recent price surge, offloading 262,000 ETH—worth approximately $445 million—over the past several days. This significant wave of selling suggests profit-taking activity from major players, which could temporarily cap upside potential. If the market fails to absorb this supply efficiently, further pressure could follow. Ethereum at a Crossroads As Whale Activity Sparks Caution Ethereum continues to struggle in reclaiming bullish momentum after losing over 55% of its value from the December highs. Despite recent attempts at recovery, ETH remains under pressure and trades below critical resistance levels, keeping the broader market cautious. Currently hovering just above the $1,800 mark, Ethereum is testing a pivotal zone that could shape its short-term trajectory. On lower time frames, ETH is beginning to form a more constructive structure, suggesting that bullish momentum may be building. Bulls are aiming to reclaim key supply zones between $1,850 and $2,000, a move that would mark a shift in market dynamics. However, heavy selling pressure still looms. Analysts are watching closely to see if Ethereum can sustain higher lows and push toward breakout levels. Yet, not everyone is convinced of a bullish continuation. Top analyst Ali Martinez recently shared data showing that whales sold approximately 262,000 ETH—worth nearly $445 million—during the latest price surge. This selloff implies that larger players may be preparing for increased volatility or a potential pullback, which could stall any short-term rally attempts. If Ethereum fails to push above immediate resistance and absorb ongoing selling pressure, it risks falling back into lower demand zones between $1,500 and $1,600. For now, holding above $1,750 is essential to keep the bullish scenario alive. With macroeconomic uncertainty and market-wide indecision still in play, Ethereum remains in a delicate balance—poised either for a significant breakout or a renewed correction. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates Against Bitcoin – Dominance Shift On The Horizon? Ethereum Price Tests Patience as Tight Range Persists Ethereum is currently trading at $1,810, caught in a narrow band between $1,850 and $1,750. This tight consolidation has lasted for several days, and the market is now awaiting a decisive breakout to set the tone for the next major move. Bulls must reclaim higher levels to confirm a breakout and validate the recent momentum shift that began earlier this month. The $1,850 resistance has capped recent attempts to move higher, and each rejection near this level adds pressure. A confirmed breakout above this level would likely trigger increased buying activity, pushing ETH toward the critical $2,000–$2,100 supply zone. This range remains the key area for bulls to reclaim in order to establish a strong uptrend and shift broader sentiment. However, the risk of rejection remains. If ETH fails to break above $1,850 or sustains a fakeout, a correction toward the lower end of the range is expected. A decisive breakdown below $1,750 could trigger a deeper retrace, targeting support near $1,600 or lower. Related Reading: Solana Forms Textbook Cup And Handle Pattern – Massive Breakout Ahead?

At the time of writing, XRP is down by more than 2% and is trading at $2.20. Wave Structure and Support Levels The ongoing pullback is interpreted as part of a larger wave 4 correction. From this zone, a further upward move is possible, with chances for XRP to form another higher high. However, a deeper retracement cannot be excluded. In the event of another leg down, support between $1.22 and $1.34 would become the next area to watch. The $1.21 level remains pivotal. A break below this point would significantly weaken the bullish case, suggesting a shift toward a more bearish outlook. Bullish Prospects and Price Targets As long as XRP holds above the current upper support levels, the potential for an upward breakout remains on the table. Possible targets in this scenario include $5.00, $5.65, and even $6.60. While speculative discussions have pointed to the possibility of XRP reaching $10 or more, such projections are considered low-probability outliers without clear structural support at this stage. Any extended fifth wave would be unusual and would require strong confirmation. Short-Term Outlook XRP has undergone a retracement, with the current price structure appearing unclear and choppy. The recent move up may represent the beginning of a diagonal pattern, following a possible wave 4 low in April. A minor B-wave correction around April 20 was shallow and may not provide enough structure to confirm the next leg upward. Currently, the price has recovered to approximately $2.16, after briefly dipping below weaker Fibonacci-based support. The more important level to monitor in the short term is $2.12. As long as this level holds, the chances remain for a continuation of the bullish pattern. A break below $2.12 could lead to a reset of the current wave count and signal a larger flat correction.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-01 03:31:28

The bill, called the Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025, would force huge economic consequences if president Vladimir Putin keeps ignoring peace talks or invades Ukraine again. According to The Wall Street Journal , Graham said on Wednesday the bill already has over 60 co-sponsors, which clears the filibuster barrier in the Senate. He expects at least 67 backers by the end of the week, which would be enough to override a veto from Trump if that ever became necessary. The support comes from both parties. It includes Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who joined without promising a floor vote. Also on board is Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Graham said the growing list should send a clear message to the White House and to Russia that the Senate is ready to act if peace talks collapse. “I let him know what we’re doing,” Graham said about Trump. “And I’m not going to speak for the president, but I will say that I hope he’s successful. I am somewhat optimistic we can get there. But we can’t let this go on forever.” Graham responds to stalled peace efforts with sanctions The timing of Graham’s move lines up with Trump’s stalled effort to stop the war in Ukraine, which began when Russia launched its full invasion in 2022. Ukraine had offered a 30-day cease-fire in March if Russia agreed, but Putin refused. Instead, he proposed a short pause in fighting between May 8 and May 10, during Russia’s annual parade honoring the end of World War II. Trump said earlier this month that Putin may be dragging him along and has no intention of stopping the war. Graham backed that thought. “It’s clear to me, and I think it’s becoming clear to President Trump, that the Russians are playing games,” he said . Even though Trump has talked about possible sanctions before, he hasn’t taken solid action. Graham teamed up with Senator Richard Blumenthal to introduce the bill earlier in April. It imposes both primary and secondary sanctions on Russia and any government supporting the war in Ukraine. It also slaps a 500% tariff on goods from countries still buying Russian oil, gas, or uranium. Graham’s office said the tariff part of the bill would hit China, India, and Iran the hardest. Taylor Reidy, his spokesperson, said it might also impact some European allies, but discussions with officials from Germany, France, Poland, and the U.K. showed they agreed it was time to take sides. Graham says bill pressure grew after new Russian attacks Although some European countries have reduced dependence on Russian energy, the EU reported that in 2024, Russia still supplied 17% of gas and 18% of liquefied natural gas imports. Graham called the sanctions in the bill “bone crushing.” He said if Putin doesn’t agree to a negotiated peace soon, the Senate will respond aggressively. “Unless there is a negotiated peace soon, I’m confident the Senate would move in overwhelming fashion to hit Russia hard.” He added that he’d rather see a diplomatic end, and said the bill gives Trump room to finish his talks. But he insisted the Senate is tired of waiting. “Most members of the Senate believe that Putin has been resistant to finding a negotiated solution to the war, and has been brazen and barbaric in his actions against Ukraine,” Graham said. “By co-sponsoring this bill I think a senator is making a pretty clear statement that they see Russia as the greatest offender here.” In the House, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick introduced a matching bill, which now has 26 co-sponsors, evenly split between Republicans and Democrats. Graham believes that if it gets a vote, it’ll pass easily. Blumenthal said, “This bill has legs, really strong legs.” He said he spoke directly with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky about it. Blumenthal said the bill sends a “bone-chilling message to Putin that Congress is steadfast and resolute behind the people of Ukraine.” When asked how long Congress would wait before moving, Graham said, “We’re talking weeks.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The figure currently stands at over 1.12 billion. Earlier today (April 30), the protocol blasted through a new important milestone. Specifically, the total number of wallet addresses that have interacted with Shibarium since its launch surpassed 200 million. The L2 blockchain solution has garnered the attention of multiple industry participants in the past months, some of whom believe SHIB’s potential rally during this bull cycle depends heavily on it. An example is the popular Bitcoin advocate Jeremie Davinci, who said : “I like Shiba Inu, as you know, and I think it will do relatively well in this cycle, but it may not go as high as you expect. I think Shiba Inu has a lot of utility now that they have Shibarium, and basically, it’s a chain that you can actually run all kinds of applications. However, nobody is using it, and there are no applications for using your tokens on Shibarium yet. If they get that solved , Shiba Inu will go to the moon.” SHIB Price Outlook Despite Shibarium’s latest achievement, Shiba Inu remains in the red today, retreating by approximately 3% and currently trading at $0.00001323 (per CoinGecko’s data). Moreover, some factors suggest the pullback could deepen in the short term. For example, the token burn mechanism has removed only a small amount of SHIB over the past week. Its main purpose is to reduce the massive circulating supply, potentially increasing the token’s value through scarcity. However, demand must head north – or, at the very least, not decline for this to have a real impact. Shiba Inu’s exchange netflow is also worth observing. In the past several days, inflows have surpassed outflows, hinting that investors have shifted toward centralized exchanges. This , in turn, increases the immediate selling pressure.

Bitcoin (BTC) is holding steady near $94,880, while altcoins like LTC, XRP, AVAX, and LINK have recorded losses. As for Pi Coin, the altcoin has struggled since peaking near $3 in February, with its price action remaining largely bearish. Pi Coin has recorded a 12% monthly decline despite a few short-lived rebounds. Will Pi Coin Price Rise in May? However, as May approaches, there are signs that Pi Coin could be gearing up for a recovery. Pi is currently trading at $0.6249, showing a 7% rise, and with a market cap now over $4 billion. While the broader crypto market sentiment shows improvement, Pi’s rise is still being limited by the absence of key catalysts, such as major exchange listings or significant mainnet upgrades. evel. On the technical front, the RSI has steadily improved from its April lows, showing growing accumulation, although at a slower pace. Overall, traders appear cautiously optimistic about Pi Coin’s future, given its historic volatility and the relatively low liquidity on exchanges. Additionally, 7.8 million Pi tokens are set to be unlocked today, which could impact the price. Is $1.70 Incoming? Despite all these challenges, analysts like Dr. Altcoin believe that Pi Coin’s price could rise to $1.70 by mid-May. The expected price increase is based on upcoming events, particularly the Consensus Summit scheduled for May 14–16, where Dr. Nicholas Kokkalis, the founder of Pi Network, is expected to give a speech. Analyst Andrew Griffiths shared that Pi Coin is currently stuck between the bulls and bears around the 0.6 level. If the trend continues upwards and breaks above 0.75-0.78, it could reach 1. However, if the price drops below 0.55, it could signal a bearish trend, possibly heading towards 0.288.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|AVAX|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-01 03:44:15

The BoJ left its benchmark interest rate frozen at 0.5%, ignoring mounting pressure from worsening US trade policies. As a result, the yen lost as much as 0.3%, hitting 143.48 against the dollar and snapping a four-month winning streak. According to Bloomberg, the central bank also pushed back its inflation target timeline and said the risk to prices is now tilted to the downside. Officials described the future of global trade as “extremely uncertain,” with no indication of how long the current chaos might last. Trump’s new tariffs have already rattled markets and made traders ditch earlier bets on tighter policy. Source: Bloomberg Ueda offers no rate timeline while factory sentiment tanks All 54 economists polled by Bloomberg had predicted the BoJ wouldn’t budge. They were right. At the press conference, Governor Kazuo Ueda offered zero indication of any near-term rate hike. Markets that once showed full confidence in a move by year-end have now slashed that to just 50%, using overnight index swaps. The yen’s strength over the last few months has been driven by a mix of Trump’s trade war, weakening US assets, and a rush into so-called safe havens. Last week, the yen touched its highest level since September, but all that reversed fast. Speculative traders had been betting big, too, as net long positions on the yen hit a record high, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Behind the scenes, BoJ officials still believe a slow, steady approach is best. They’re holding off on further tightening until they can see more data on how Trump’s policies are hitting Japan’s economy. And those numbers are already looking ugly. Japan’s manufacturing PMI for April came in at 48.7, just barely better than March’s 48.4. That’s still under the 50-point line, meaning the sector is shrinking. This is now the tenth month in a row of contraction. Worse, new orders and exports are falling even faster, showing that demand is evaporating both at home and abroad. S&P Global reported that Japanese companies are now pulling back hard. They’re cutting purchases, adjusting inventories, and turning pessimistic about the future. Confidence in upcoming output is now at its lowest point since mid-2020, when the COVID crisis was still ripping through markets. S&P said that without major improvements in demand inside and outside Japan, “firms are likely to struggle to see a recovery in conditions.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

All are leveraging strong fundamentals, strategic narratives, and expanding ecosystems to drive investor confidence. Backed by bullish technicals and institutional momentum, these altcoins are poised to influence the direction of the market throughout Q2. Solana (SOL) Gains Traction From ETF Momentum Solana (SOL) is trading between $145 and $150 , riding on the back of a 41% price surge in April and continued interest heading into May. A key development— Canada’s approval of the world’s first spot SOL ETF —has shifted institutional sentiment toward Solana. If SOL can clear resistance at $180 , analysts project a rally toward $221 , signaling a return to its bullish trajectory. Beyond price, SOL’s developer ecosystem remains one of the fastest-growing in the sector, and long-term holder accumulation has continued to reinforce the bullish narrative. Polygon (MATIC) Benefits From Ethereum Strength Currently priced around $1.03 , Polygon (MATIC) remains one of the most reliable Ethereum Layer 2 solutions. As Ethereum maintains strong technical support and bullish forecasts for May, MATIC benefits directly from its integration and scalability role. Forecasts for MATIC’s 2025 performance are bullish, with potential highs exceeding $6.25 . With strong fundamentals and institutional interest in Layer 2 platforms increasing, MATIC continues to look undervalued at current levels. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST!

Nasdaq-listed crypto firms posted strong gains in April after a period of macroeconomic uncertainty. Galaxy CEO Mike Novogratz says the listing will broaden the company’s investor base and US presence. The Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) listed crypto investment firm Galaxy Digital is set to move to the US-based Nasdaq on May 16, pending stakeholder approval at its upcoming shareholders meeting. Galaxy’s planned move comes as several Nasdaq-listed crypto firms saw substantial gains in April, following a turbulent few months of macroeconomic uncertainty. Galaxy founder and CEO Mike Novogratz said on April 30 that the listing would be a milestone “that would position us to advance our vision of building a gateway for investors to safely and efficiently access every corner of the digital asset and artificial intelligence ecosystems.” Nasdaq listing will widen Galaxy’s investor base A special Galaxy shareholders' meeting is scheduled for May 9 to seek final approval for the move, with Nasdaq also needing to offer its approval before listing the crypto firm. The company plans to use the ticker symbol GLXY on the Nasdaq, and if it goes ahead with the listing, will enter a transition period during which it will continue to trade on the TSX, on which it first listed in July 2020. Galaxy is down 12.28% on the TSX so far this year amid a broader market downturn, according to Google Finance data. GLXY is own 12.28% since Jan. 1 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Source: Google Finance Meanwhile, the Nasdaq 100 is down 7.33% so far in 2025, according to TradingView data. However, it held steady in April, with some commentators downplaying the recent bearish sentiment. Novogratz is widely known as a pro-crypto advocate and Bitcoin ( BTC ) bull. It was reported on April 17 that Galaxy Ventures Fund I LP is expected to raise around $175 million to $180 million by the end of June to build a portfolio of 30 crypto and blockchain startups. Crypto entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano said in an April 30 X post that “the Nasdaq 100 ended April up more than 1%, and people are still talking about the Great Depression.” “Insane,” Pompliano added.

Recently, Dan Tapiero—founder of 10T Holdings and a long-time investor—shared his thoughts on XRP, praising its ability to survive in a tough and fast-changing industry. In an interview with CoinDesk, he said that, “One very impressive thing about XRP is just how long it’s lasted, how many times it’s come under attack. It’s the Lindy effect—the longer it exists, the stronger it becomes.” A History of Scrutiny and Survival XRP’s journey has been anything but smooth. Its parent company, Ripple Labs, has faced fierce criticism and legal challenges—including a high-profile lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that resulted in XRP being delisted from several major U.S. exchanges. For a time, it looked like XRP might fade into obscurity. But the token didn’t disappear. It bounced back. Despite detractors—particularly among Bitcoin maximalists and Ethereum loyalists—XRP has retained a passionate community and continued use cases. ETFs and the American Edge Recent chatter around ProShares launching XRP ETFs has sparked fresh interest, though it’s met with mixed reactions in the crypto community. Tapiero points out that while Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate headlines, XRP is carving out a unique identity—and doing so from U.S. soil. “It’s made in America. And with this administration, that matters,” he said. A Personal Connection Tapiero’s connection to XRP runs deep. His first crypto trades were in Bitcoin and XRP, executed via a platform then called BitReserve—now known as Uphold. His gold firm, Gold Bullion International (GBI), was the first to let users trade gold for XRP and Bitcoin. Back then, XRP traded at a tenth of a cent. Today, it fluctuates around $2.00 depending on market cycles. Looking back, Tapiero admits he didn’t fully understand XRP at the time and didn’t hold onto it long-term. But his takeaway is one many in the space can relate to: “Just because you didn’t buy it at a tenth of a cent doesn’t mean you couldn’t buy it at one cent, or ten cents. If you believe in something, never give up on it.”",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|FIAT|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-01 04:09:40

The surge in trading volumes, as investors looked to hedge their positions in a volatile market, helped the platform’s profits more than double, surpassing analysts’ expectations. The company’s transaction-based revenue, which includes income from options, crypto, and equities trading, shot up by 77% this quarter. A significant chunk of this came from crypto, which brought in $252m in revenue, marking a 100% jump from the same time last year. That figure slightly exceeded the $247m that analysts had predicted, underscoring the strength of Robinhood’s crypto business. Robinhood Markets has just released financial results for the first quarter of 2025.

Despite market volatility, crypto transactions remained strong, a trend that’s been crucial for Robinhood’s success. CEO Vlad Tenev said that while the company continues to rely on crypto volumes, it’s working to diversify beyond that. Over time, Robinhood plans to make the crypto side of its business less dependent on transaction volumes. “We’re focused on diversifying the business outside of crypto,” Tenev said during the earnings call . “This will make us less reliant on crypto transaction volumes in the future.” Image Source: Robinhood Strong Performance Across Options, Equities, and Margin Investments Fuel Robinhood’s Q1 Success But it wasn’t just crypto that fueled Robinhood’s success. The company also saw impressive growth in options and equities trading. Revenue from options jumped 56%, while equities grew by 44%. Net interest revenue, which mainly comes from margin investing, jumped 14% to $290m. Robinhood’s platform assets rose by 70% year-over-year, reaching $221b, with record net deposits of $18b. Tenev pointed out that customers are not only trading more, but they’re also entrusting Robinhood with more of their assets. The company’s net income for the quarter hit $336m, or 37 cents per share, compared to $157m, or 18 cents per share, last year. Analysts had forecasted a profit of 33 cents per share. This strong performance came despite the ongoing trade tensions between the US and China, which kept markets on edge. The first quarter was marked by significant swings in both stocks and crypto prices, largely due to President Donald Trump’s trade policies. While some markets have started to recover from the losses in April, the uncertainty continues, creating opportunities for platforms like Robinhood to succeed in the current volatile environment.

World’s orbs — chrome, bowling ball-shaped devices that scan a person’s eyeballs to confirm their identity — will initially be available to Americans in six “key innovation hubs,” the company said: Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville and San Francisco. Those who decide to take the plunge and gaze into the orb will gain access to the World app and receive an airdrop of World’s WLD token. By the end of the year, the project aims to have enough orbs spread throughout the U.S. to give 180 million Americans, more than half the population, access to World’s network. Altman and other executives at World’s parent company Tools for Humanity announced the U.S. expansion at a press conference in San Francisco on Wednesday evening, along with a dizzying slew of new features and partnerships for the project. The World app will now offer its users access to crypto-backed loans through non-custodial lending protocol Morpho and prediction markets through Kalshi. Later this year, WLD holders will be able to spend their tokens like cash with a new World-linked Visa debit card. The project is even integrating its identity-verification technology into some online dating apps. Starting with Tinder users in Japan, online dating giant Match Group will pilot using World ID to verify the ages of its users. Altman said that the idea for World predated OpenAI, his generative artificial intelligence (AI) company. “We needed some sort of way for authenticating humans in the age of [artificial general intelligence],” Altman said during the press conference. “We needed a way that we could know what content was made by humans, [and what was made] by AI. We wanted a way to make sure that humans stayed special and central in a world where the internet was going to have lots of AI-driven content.” Altman’s initial ideas about how to solve the problem of human verification were “very crazy,” he said – World and its eye-scanning orbs, only a little. World is the latest crypto project to announce a U.S. expansion. Since President Donald Trump took office in January, the regulatory environment has become much friendlier to crypto projects. The company announced it would be building a factory in Richardson, Texas – a suburb of Dallas – to help produce the orbs needed for its coming U.S. expansion. After the initial rollout, other major cities including Seattle, Orlando, San Diego and Las Vegas will receive the second wave of orbs. “They will really be everywhere,” said Alex Blania, Tools for Humanity’s co-founder. “They will be in gas stations, convenience stores, and you will be able to verify within 10 minutes wherever you are.”",Tech|World Token|Sam Altman|Openai|News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|WLD|AIRDROP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-01 04:20:02

In a 9-6 ruling, the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia refused to lift a legal order that’s been blocking the Social Security Administration (SSA) from giving unrestricted access to DOGE, the government agency led by Elon Musk . Trump’s administration tried to push past that block, but the court told them no. This case started after US District Judge Ellen Lipton Hollander in Maryland issued an injunction on April 17, saying SSA most likely broke federal privacy laws by trying to hand over private data to DOGE without restrictions. Now, the appeals court has kept that injunction in place. The White House still wants access, and Liz Huston, Trump’s spokesperson, said in a statement that the president “will continue to seek all legal remedies available to ensure the will of the American people is executed.” Judges say DOGE overstepped with data grab Trump and Elon launched DOGE to wipe out what they call “government waste.” That includes cutting jobs, gutting federal departments, and cracking open databases. But this time, they ran into resistance. DOGE had already been cleared to access sensitive information at the Treasury, Education, and Office of Personnel Management, but now the line has been drawn at Social Security. Three separate plaintiffs – two labor unions and an advocacy group – sued DOGE, Elon, and SSA in February. They wanted DOGE banned from accessing SSA’s most secure internal systems. Those systems hold data on roughly 73 million Americans, including people who get retirement and disability benefits. Elon said the system is corrupt. He claimed that millions of dead Americans were still getting checks, even though that statement has no proof behind it. Trump echoed the same fraud claims, despite also saying he wouldn’t cut Social Security. But federal judges weren’t moved. Judge Robert King, who joined the majority in the 9–6 vote, made it clear in a written opinion that SSA was trusted with sensitive information and had failed to protect it. “This highly sensitive personal information has long been handed over to SSA by the American people with every reason to believe that the information would be fiercely protected,” King said. King added that trust was broken the moment DOGE was allowed into the system. Judge Hollander had already made it clear two weeks earlier that DOGE had no business digging around in those systems. The level of access DOGE received was higher than that of even SSA’s most senior staffers. King said the evidence was solid and the stakes were higher than anything DOGE had done before. “The case over Social Security data was substantially stronger,” he said. Judge Julius Richardson, one of the six who voted against keeping the injunction, said the court should’ve treated this case the same as DOGE’s previous data access at other departments. But Richardson got outvoted. The majority didn’t agree. They saw Social Security data as a different beast. DOGE is now being forced to back off. The ruling says the agency can’t access SSA’s data and also demands that DOGE delete any personally identifiable information it has already pulled from the SSA. That part is final unless Trump’s team gets the Supreme Court involved. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

XRP , Kaspa (KAS) , NEAR Protocol (NEAR) , and Injective (INJ) are each gaining attention for their unique roles in the ecosystem. But one project is beginning to capture long-term interest at a deeper level— MAGACOINFINANCE.COM , now viewed by some as a viable contender among high-visibility tokens. XRP Holds the Spotlight, but Others are Catching Up XRP is trading around $2.15 , up significantly in April with a strong weekly rally of over 10% . Fueling the surge is the approval of futures-based XRP ETFs in the U.S., with the ProShares fund launching this week. As institutional money flows in and CME prepares to launch its own XRP futures, attention is focused on whether XRP can break above resistance at $2.45 . Kaspa (KAS) is seeing renewed buying momentum. With an April average near $0.10 , forecasts point toward a possible rally to $0.317–$0.333 in May. Kaspa’s appeal lies in its unique blockDAG architecture, which continues to differentiate it from other proof-of-work coins. NEAR Protocol (NEAR) , though without major headlines this week, remains stable in price and continues to develop its scalable ecosystem. Developers and long-term holders remain committed, and technical indicators suggest NEAR could benefit from any Ethereum-led rally. Injective (INJ) , while also light on news, has retained strong community support and is positioned as a leading infrastructure protocol in decentralized trading. The project’s long-term development roadmap and integrations continue to fuel speculation of renewed upside heading into Q2. MAGACOINFINANCE – Strategic Growth With Long-Term Vision While the spotlight often falls on high-cap assets or short-term headlines, MAGACOINFINANCE is building something far more strategic. With a clear brand identity, rising community strength, and growing visibility, MAGACOINFINANCE is capturing the interest of traders looking for the next meaningful opportunity. MAGACOINFINANCE blends message, mission, and early-stage timing into a cohesive value proposition. It’s steadily gaining traction—supported not by hype alone, but by consistent growth, focused messaging, and ecosystem expansion. Savvy analysts forecast a developing movement with lasting potential in MAGACOINFINANCE. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Final Thoughts While XRP continues to dominate headlines with its institutional shift, altcoins like Kaspa , NEAR , and Injective are quietly gaining ground. But in a market where new narratives often lead the next cycle, MAGACOINFINANCE is increasingly part of the conversation.

Companies of all sizes are eager to harness the power of AI, recognizing its potential for game-changing applications. However, turning exciting AI pilot projects into real-world production systems remains a significant hurdle for many enterprises. Revolutionizing IT Consulting with AI Enter Gruve.ai, a startup founded by the experienced team behind Rahi Systems, an IT solutions company acquired by Wesco for $225 million in 2022. Gruve aims to tackle the challenge of getting AI solutions out of the testing phase and into practical application. Their approach is unique: they use AI itself to deliver their consulting services. For decades, traditional IT consulting firms, including major players, have been the go-to partners for companies lacking in-house skilled staff to implement new technology. However, this human-centric model often comes with significant costs. As Tarun Raisoni, CEO of Gruve, told Bitcoin World, the technology services industry hasn’t seen significant disruption in 25 to 30 years, but AI is fundamentally changing that dynamic. Gruve plans to transform the traditional consulting model in two key ways: Leveraging AI Agents: Reducing the need for a large human consulting staff by employing AI agents to handle repetitive or standardized tasks. Usage-Based Pricing: Shifting from traditional hourly billing to charging clients based on their actual usage of the implemented AI solutions. Achieving Software-Like Margins Through AI Services Historically, venture capitalists have shown limited interest in IT services firms primarily because their reliance on human labor made scaling difficult and kept margins relatively low. By substituting human consultants with AI agents for specific tasks, Gruve can achieve software-like gross margins, potentially reaching 70% to 80%. This is significantly higher than the typical margins seen in traditional tech consulting businesses, according to Navin Chaddha, managing partner at Mayfield. This innovative model, combined with the team’s proven track record from building Rahi Systems, has attracted significant investment. Gruve recently raised a $20 million Series A funding round led by Mayfield, with participation from Cisco Investments and other investors. This brings Gruve’s total funding to $37.5 million, providing substantial capital to scale its AI-driven consulting approach. Delivering Enterprise AI Solutions Raisoni explained that Gruve begins by understanding a client’s specific AI needs and preparing their data to support AI applications. This foundational step is crucial because every business has unique processes, workflows, and client servicing methods. Only after this deep understanding do they recommend and implement AI solutions. Once implementation begins, AI agents take over specific tasks, such as detecting security breaches or managing the transition from on-premises systems to cloud-based CRM. Like traditional consultancies, Gruve partners with trusted technology vendors, including large companies like Cisco, IBM’s Red Hat, and Google, as well as specialized AI-native startups like Glean and Supervity, to deploy solutions. The Shift to Usage-Based AI Consulting A major differentiator for Gruve is its billing model. Unlike most consultancies that bill upon implementation or based on hours, Gruve’s services are available on demand, similar to how electricity or cloud computing is provided. Navin Chaddha highlighted this, stating that if Gruve implements an AI solution for security, the client is charged only when the installed AI detects and analyzes a security breach. This usage-based model aligns the cost directly with the value and outcome delivered by the AI, potentially making advanced enterprise AI more accessible and predictable for businesses hesitant about the upfront costs and uncertain ROI of traditional consulting engagements. By proving value through results, Gruve aims to build long-term relationships based on performance rather than simply hours billed. In summary, Gruve.ai is poised to disrupt the long-standing IT consulting industry by leveraging AI agents to deliver services, achieve high software-like margins, and offer a client-friendly usage-based pricing model. Their focus on moving AI projects from pilot to production, combined with significant funding and experienced leadership, positions them as a key player in the future of AI services and implementation for enterprises seeking to truly operationalize AI.

In a 40-minute appearance on The Scoop with Frank Chaparro released Wednesday, Bea framed the idea as hiding in plain sight. “Sometimes the ideas are so big that people either can’t hear them or don’t want to hear them,” he said at the top of the interview. “But they’ve got to listen to this one.” By statute, the 261.5 million-ounce US gold hoard is still recorded at $42.22 per ounce—a valuation fixed in 1973. At Wednesday’s spot price of roughly $3,303, the gap between book value and market value is almost $900 billion. “So today, because of law, the US government still values gold that it holds in Fort Knox at $42 and change,” Bea noted. “If they were to just mark that to market, that’s an incremental 900 to … I heard a billion to a trillion dollars.” From Mark-To-Market To Bitcoin Bea’s central contention is that Congress could pass a short bill amending 31 U.S.C. § 5117, re-strike higher-denomination gold certificates, and credit the revaluation gain to a sovereign-wealth-style account at Treasury in line with US president Donald Trump’s executive order for a strategic Bitcoin reserve—without adding to headline federal debt. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Explode To $210,000 This Year, Says Quant Powerhouse Presto “When the revaluation occurs, that creates a $900 billion mark-to-market gain, which the Treasury could then take in a budget-neutral manner to go and buy a variety of things. We think probably including Bitcoin,” he said. His arithmetic mirrors Senator Cynthia Lummis’ BITCOIN Act, introduced earlier this year, which directs Treasury to acquire one million BTC (around $100 billion at prevailing prices) over five years while remaining deficit neutral. Bea argued that a US purchase of that size—about 5.5% of Bitcoin’s $1.8 trillion market capitalization—would almost certainly prompt other states to respond. “It’s hard to see a situation where other governments don’t feel compelled in some way to measure up,” he said, adding that the dynamic could resemble the “competitive situation” in gold, where central banks bought a record 1,037 tonnes last year. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Net Taker Volume Turns Positive, New All-Time High Incoming? Central bank demand for gold is motivated by “the overall level of debt that they see and the concerns around the global economy,” Bea said. “So does it seem so crazy to maybe save in some Bitcoin at, say, a ninety-to-ten ratio, given the whole world is going online?” How Soon Is ‘Sooner Than Expected’? Bea would not commit to a precise timetable but told Chaparro that the legal change “could be this year.” He suggested the trigger could come from legislators seeking an offset for new outlays—or from Treasury itself if political momentum builds behind the Lummis bill. “As soon as you understand the pipes of how banks and how the government works,” he concluded, “you realize they can revalue gold and buy Bitcoin and still be budget neutral. And once that’s on the table, it’s really just a matter of political will.” At press time, BTC traded at $93,422.

Recently, a report from the popular blockchain transaction tracker, Whale Alert, caught the attention of traders and enthusiasts alike: a substantial USDC mint of 250 million coins at the USDC Treasury . This isn’t just a large number; it’s an event that sparks questions about potential capital flows, market liquidity, and the role of stablecoin s like USDC in the broader crypto market . Let’s dive into what this massive minting event could signify. What Exactly Happened with the USDC Mint? According to the alert disseminated by Whale Alert, 250,000,000 units of USD Coin (USDC) were recently minted. The reported location for this creation event was the ‘USDC Treasury’. To understand the significance, we first need to understand what USDC is and how it operates. USDC is a digital stablecoin that is pegged to the US dollar on a 1:1 basis. This means that ideally, one USDC is always equivalent in value to one US dollar. It’s managed by a consortium called Centre, founded by payment technology company Circle and cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. The core idea behind USDC is to provide a stable store of value and medium of exchange within the volatile cryptocurrency ecosystem. Minting USDC essentially means creating new tokens. This process is supposed to be backed by an equivalent amount of US dollars (or dollar-denominated assets) held in reserve by Circle and its partners. The ‘USDC Treasury’ can be thought of as the designated address or mechanism through which new USDC tokens are issued into circulation or burned (taken out of circulation). When a large amount like 250 million USDC is minted, it indicates that Circle or an authorized partner has received a significant deposit of fiat currency (US dollars) and is issuing new USDC tokens against those reserves. This injection of new stablecoins into the ecosystem is what makes the event noteworthy. Why Does a Large USDC Mint Matter for the Crypto Market? The minting of 250 million USDC has several potential implications for the broader crypto market : Increased Stablecoin Supply: Simply put, there are now 250 million more USDC tokens in existence and potentially ready to be moved or deployed. Potential for New Capital Inflow: The most common reason for minting stablecoins is that someone (an institution, an exchange, a large investor) has deposited fiat currency and wants to convert it into a digital, stable form to interact within the crypto ecosystem. This often precedes buying activity in volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Enhanced Exchange Liquidity: Large amounts of stablecoins are frequently moved to cryptocurrency exchanges to provide liquidity for trading pairs. A large mint could indicate that exchanges are preparing for increased trading volume or need to balance their stablecoin reserves. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deals: Large mints can also facilitate large over-the-counter trades, where institutions or whales trade crypto directly without using public exchanges, often settling in stablecoins. Market Sentiment: While not a direct price driver, a large mint can be interpreted positively by the market, suggesting that significant capital is positioning itself to potentially enter crypto positions. It’s crucial to note that minting USDC doesn’t *automatically* mean that 250 million dollars are about to be spent buying Bitcoin or other altcoins. The minted USDC could be used for various purposes, including: Providing liquidity on DeFi protocols. Internal transfers or treasury management by Circle or partners. Preparing for large withdrawals from exchanges (less common for a mint, but possible). Settling non-crypto transactions using stablecoins. However, given the historical patterns, large stablecoin mints are often correlated with periods of increased buying pressure or accumulation within the crypto market. How Does Circle Manage the USDC Stablecoin? Understanding the role of Circle is key to understanding USDC . As a primary issuer, Circle is responsible for ensuring that each USDC token is backed by reserves. These reserves are held in segregated accounts and are audited regularly (though the frequency and depth of audits have been subjects of discussion and regulatory focus). Circle facilitates the minting and redemption process. When a user or entity wants to mint USDC, they send US dollars to Circle’s bank accounts. Once the funds are verified, Circle instructs the Centre smart contract to mint the equivalent amount of USDC tokens and send them to the user’s crypto wallet. Conversely, to redeem USDC, a user sends USDC back to Circle, and Circle burns the tokens and sends the equivalent US dollars to the user’s bank account. The ‘USDC Treasury’ is the operational hub for these activities. Reports from Whale Alert often track movements to and from these treasury addresses, providing transparency (to some extent) into the supply dynamics of the stablecoin. Is This USDC Minting Event a Bullish Signal? Many market participants view large USDC mint events as potentially bullish signals. The logic is simple: if someone is bringing 250 million US dollars into the crypto ecosystem via USDC, they likely intend to use that capital within the ecosystem. The most common use case for large amounts of stablecoins is to purchase other cryptocurrencies. While this correlation has held true historically in many instances, it’s not a guaranteed predictor of market movements. The impact depends on: Who minted the USDC: Was it an exchange, an institution, a hedge fund, or Circle itself for operational purposes? Where the USDC is sent: Is it moved to a major exchange, a DeFi protocol, or held in a private wallet? Market Context: Is the overall market sentiment positive or negative? Are there other significant economic or crypto-specific events happening? A 250 million USDC mint is a significant amount, representing a substantial potential influx of capital. It adds dry powder to the market, which *could* be deployed into buying assets. Traders often monitor these large movements reported by Whale Alert as part of their market analysis, looking for potential signs of institutional interest or impending large trades. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Market Observer For those watching the crypto market , a large USDC mint like this provides a data point to consider: Monitor Exchange Inflows: Keep an eye on where this newly minted USDC flows. If a significant portion lands on major exchanges, it might signal intent to trade. Watch Key Price Levels: Increased stablecoin liquidity can sometimes fuel upward price movements if buying pressure materializes. Pay attention to key support and resistance levels for major cryptocurrencies. Consider Market Depth: More stablecoins on exchanges can increase market depth, potentially leading to less volatility during large trades. Stay Informed: Follow reports from Whale Alert and reputable crypto news sources to understand the context and potential follow-up movements of this large sum. It’s always wise to combine this information with other forms of analysis, including technical indicators, fundamental news, and overall market sentiment. A single data point, while interesting, rarely tells the whole story. Challenges and Considerations Regarding Stablecoins While USDC and other stablecoins play a vital role in the crypto market by providing stability and acting as on/off ramps for fiat, they also face challenges and considerations: Regulatory Scrutiny: Stablecoins are under increasing global regulatory focus regarding their reserve backing, transparency, and potential systemic risk. Reserve Transparency: While Circle provides attestations, the nature and liquidity of reserves are always points of discussion and require trust in the issuer. Centralization: Stablecoins like USDC are centrally issued and managed, which contrasts with the decentralized ethos of many cryptocurrencies. This introduces counterparty risk. Competition: The stablecoin landscape is competitive, with Tether (USDT), Dai (DAI), and others vying for market share. These factors are important to keep in mind when evaluating the broader impact of stablecoin activities like large mints. Conclusion: What Does 250 Million USDC Really Mean? The minting of 250 million USDC at the USDC Treasury , as reported by Whale Alert, is a significant event that injects substantial liquidity into the cryptocurrency ecosystem. While it doesn’t guarantee immediate buying pressure, it strongly suggests that a large amount of capital has entered the digital asset space via Circle ‘s stablecoin. This influx of stablecoins enhances the potential for trading activity, provides liquidity for exchanges and DeFi protocols, and is often interpreted by market participants as a potentially positive signal, indicating that large players are positioning themselves. As always, market observers should monitor the flow of this newly minted stablecoin to gain further insight into its intended use and potential impact on asset prices. The event underscores the critical role that stablecoins play as a bridge between traditional finance and the dynamic, often volatile, world of cryptocurrency, constantly influencing the ebb and flow of the crypto market .

The House passed the Digital Assets Investment Act, or House Bill 92, on its third reading on April 30 by a vote of 71 to 44. Republican House Speaker Destin Hall introduced the bill in February, which would allow the treasurer to allocate 5% of the state’s investments into designated digital assets. The investments can only be made after obtaining an independent third-party assessment confirming that the crypto holdings are maintained with a secure custody solution and risk oversight and regulatory compliance standards are met. New amendments allow the treasurer to examine the feasibility of allowing members of retirement and deferred compensation plans to elect to invest in digital assets held as exchange-traded products ( ETPs ). The House also passed a related bill, the State Investment Modernization Act, or HB 506 , with little discussion on April 30, in a 110 to 3 vote. The bill aims to create the North Carolina Investment Authority (NCIA) to take over investment management from the treasurer. If passed into law, authority to invest in digital assets would transfer from the treasurer to NICA, and it would require approval from its board of directors based on third-party assessments to make crypto investments. Local news outlet NC Newsline reported that Treasurer Brad Briner supports both bills. Crypto legislation race.

During a NewsNation Town Hall meeting moderated by Bill O’Reilly, Trump was asked whether the duties he has threatened on foreign goods suffer from a “perception problem.” “Yeah,” he replied. “But I’m an honest guy, and we have to save the country.” The president conceded the strategy could cost Republicans control of the House of Representatives in the November midterm elections, yet insisted he will press ahead. “I just think that I’ll be able to convince people how good this is,” he said. Trump on the phone during a NewsNation Town Hall meeting. Source: NewsNation The remarks followed a Bureau of Economic Analysis estimate showing the U.S. economy shrank at the start of the year for the first time since 2022. The report cited a flood of pre-tariff imports and lower federal spending. An ADP Research release the same morning said April hiring fell short of forecasts, jolting Wall Street. Many investors want quick movement on trade, but Trump told viewers he is “in less of a hurry” than the market. He said tentative understandings exist with South Korea, Japan and India, though he warned announcements will not come overnight. “We are sitting on the cat bird seat. They want us. We don’t need them,” he declared, later adding that India wants to “make a deal so bad.” In China, Trump said there is a “very good chance” of an accord, but only “on our terms and it’s got to be fair.” When O’Reilly suggested confirmed agreements could spark a stock rally, the president replied the pacts were “potential deals,” adding, “that’s OK, it can wait two weeks.” Trump admitted his tariff playbook is tough to explain because he often opens with the hardest line, then pulls back. “You can’t just be hard line, and I’m going to run right through a wall and I’m never going to go over it or around it, I’m going to go straight — you have to be able to dodge and move,” he said. Officials are reassuring Wall Street that talks are on track US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told Fox News that an initial batch of agreements is “weeks and not months” away. “I would say that we have deals that are close,” Greer said. He emphasized he was talking about a “first tranche” of trade pacts, not the full agenda. US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on Fox News. Source: Fox News Greer said negotiations with India are not “finish line close,” though he speaks regularly with New Delhi’s lead envoy. He expects to meet South Korean counterparts “pretty soon,” describing those talks as “going in the right direction.” On Thursday, he plans sessions with Japan, Guyana and Saudi Arabia, followed by a meeting with representatives from the Philippines. Administration officials have said that Asian partners who engaged early could see their agreements announced first. The trade envoy also called newly elected Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney a “serious person” and said his office is ready to engage once Carney visits Washington. Trump spent part of the day defending his economic record and blaming the GDP slide on former President Joe Biden. “This is the Biden economy,” he told dozens of business leaders at the White House before adding, “We’ve had a lot of things happen since November 5.” Executives from General Electric, Hyundai Motor, Toyota Motor, Johnson & Johnson, Eli Lilly, Nvidia, and SoftBank attended the event, which highlighted capital spending in Trump’s first 100 days in office. The S&P 500 has fallen more than 8 percent since Inauguration Day, and consumer confidence in April fell to a near five-year low. Still, Trump argued his tariffs are fueling an “unprecedented surge” in domestic manufacturing. “Every new factory and every new job created is a sign of strength in the American economy and a declaration of confidence in America’s future,” he said as the meeting wrapped up.

According to Coinglass data , $13.9 million in long positions were liquidated in just 24 hours, compared to only $1.49 million in shorts, a nearly 1000% imbalance. This kind of imbalance shows that traders have a strong long bias. When prices decline, too many long positions can be quickly wiped out, which is what happened in this case, causing a quick cascade that drove prices even lower. Additionally, open interest fell by 4%, indicating that many traders were exiting positions. Despite this, XRP ( XRP ) has since recovered to a crucial psychological support level of about $2.20. According to some traders, this was a “flush,” removing weak hands ahead of a possible reversal. Others fear that if prices decline again, the long bias may result in additional liquidations and capitulation. This drop came at a surprising time when many traders are expecting sustained upward momentum. XRP has seen strong progress so far this year. The Securities and Exchange Commission recently paused its appeal against Ripple, paving the way for the company to potentially work with U.S. banks again in the near future.

Moreover, over ten firms have applied for XRP spot exchange-traded funds, with analysts forecasting 80% or higher odds of approval. Another catalyst that might eventually increase the volume of the XRP Ledger is Ripple’s acquisition of Hidden Road, a broker that moves more than $10 billion daily. On the technical side, the asset is trading in a tight range with no strong momentum in either direction, making the $2.15 and $2.30 levels critical to watch in the near term. Most technical indicators currently reflect a neutral outlook. With a relative strength index of 52.47, there is no discernible trend. XRP price analysis. Credit: crypto.news However, there appears to be a slight bullish bias as indicated by the moving average convergence divergence indicators, which are pointing slightly upward. While longer-term averages paint a mixed picture, shorter-term estimated moving averages (10, 20, 30) are in buy territory. The 200-day SMA and EMA are bullish and provide support at about $2.00. If XRP manages to stay above the $2.15–$2.20 range and breaks above $2.30, it could signal a shift toward a bullish trend. This would align with recent developments that favor Ripple. On the downside, failure to hold above $2.15 could lead to another round of long liquidations. Many traders are still highly leveraged, as shown by the current imbalance, which leaves the market vulnerable to sudden drops.

Users who stake HYPE can earn discounts ranging from 5% to 40%. Spot and perpetual volumes will be counted together, with spot volume weighted double. Hyperliquid will also allow linked staking and trading accounts, a new feature that adds flexibility but can’t be undone once linked.

It’s a value system that extends beyond digital assets into the gadgets we use daily. That’s why recent news regarding Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses warrants your immediate attention, as Meta has made significant changes to how it handles user data and privacy. Understanding the New Ray-Ban Meta Privacy Policy Meta recently updated the privacy policy for its smart glasses, the Ray-Ban Meta. This update grants the tech giant increased authority over storing and utilizing user data, specifically for training its artificial intelligence models. Owners received an email notification on Tuesday, according to reports, detailing these changes. A key alteration is that AI features on the glasses are now enabled by default. This means that when certain AI functionalities are active, Meta’s AI will analyze photos and videos captured through the glasses. Furthermore, Meta will now store users’ voice recordings to enhance its products, and notably, there is no direct opt-out option for this storage. How Does Meta AI Use Your Data? It’s important to clarify that the glasses are not constantly recording everything around you. The device specifically stores speech triggered by the “Hey Meta” wake word. According to Meta’s privacy notice on voice services for wearables, voice transcripts and recordings can be stored for up to one year. This data is primarily used to improve Meta’s AI products. Companies like Meta are actively seeking large volumes of diverse voice recordings. This data is invaluable for training generative AI models. By analyzing a wider range of audio, Meta’s AI can potentially become better at processing different accents, dialects, and speech patterns, leading to improved voice recognition and AI interaction. What Data Collection Should You Be Aware Of? While the voice recording storage after the wake word is a primary concern, the policy update also highlights the analysis of photos and videos when AI features are on. This means visual data captured through the glasses could also be contributing to the training data for Meta’s AI models. This extensive data collection approach is not unique to Meta. Amazon recently implemented a similar policy change affecting Echo users, routing all commands through the cloud, eliminating a local processing option. The drive for companies to collect vast amounts of data stems from the insatiable need of modern AI models for training content. Managing Your Privacy Settings Given these changes, it’s crucial for Ray-Ban Meta owners to review their privacy settings . While you cannot opt-out of voice recording storage for AI training directly, you do have control over deleting recordings. To prevent Meta from training its AI on your voice data, you must manually delete each recording via the Ray-Ban Meta companion app. This places the burden of data management squarely on the user. Consider these actionable steps: Open the Ray-Ban Meta companion app. Navigate to the privacy or settings section. Look for options related to voice recordings or AI data. Manually delete stored recordings regularly. Review default AI feature settings and disable any you don’t actively use or are uncomfortable with. The Broader Implications of AI Training Data Improving AI capabilities is the stated goal, but it comes at a cost to user privacy. Users might not fully grasp that using their glasses to photograph or video someone could potentially result in that person’s likeness contributing to Meta’s AI training data, especially if AI features are active. The sheer volume of content required by these models incentivizes companies to leverage the data their users are already generating. Meta’s history with user data isn’t new; it already trains its Llama AI models on public posts from platforms like Facebook and Instagram. This latest move with Ray-Ban Meta glasses extends that data collection frontier into personal interactions captured through wearable technology. Conclusion The updated privacy policy for Ray-Ban Meta glasses represents a significant shift towards enabling default AI features and collecting user data, including voice recordings and visual analysis, for AI training. While aimed at improving AI products, this raises substantial privacy concerns for owners. Taking proactive steps to review and manage your privacy settings, particularly by manually deleting voice recordings, is essential to maintain control over your personal data in the age of pervasive AI.

This legislative move comes in response to a $16 billion deficit in the pension system and a need for improved investment returns compared to other states. NC’s Investment Authority Could Allocate 5% Of Portfolio To Bitcoin House Bill 506 proposes the establishment of a five-member board, the North Carolina Investment Authority, which will oversee the state’s $127 billion investment portfolio. This board will be composed of the State Treasurer, who currently holds final authority over state investments, along with four other appointees. The appointments will be made by key state leaders, including the Speaker of the House, the Senate President Pro Tem, and the governor. Each appointee must possess substantial expertise in investments and have a minimum of ten years of successful management experience in pensions, endowments, or similar fields. Related Reading: Bitcoin Raging Bull Indicator Turns Back On, But This Level Holds The Key In conjunction with this restructuring, House Bill 92 allows the Investment Authority to allocate up to 5% of the state’s portfolio to cryptocurrency and Bitcoin investments. This provision is designed to limit investments to mutual fund equivalents of cryptocurrencies rather than direct purchases of specific currencies, ensuring a more cautious approach to this volatile market. Supporters of the legislation, including State Treasurer Brad Briner, believe that diversifying investments into cryptocurrencies represents a proactive strategy to enhance the fund’s performance. Democrats Raise Concerns Over Crypto Risks Briner, a Republican elected in November, has expressed a desire to modernize the investment approach, contrasting with the more conservative strategies employed by his predecessor, Dale Folwell. “We need to spread the allocation around,” said Rep. Keith Kidwell (R-Beaufort), emphasizing the importance of diversification in investment strategies. The bills are seen as a step toward utilizing emerging market opportunities to benefit state employees and retirees. However, the measures have drawn criticism from some Democrats who caution against the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrency investments. Rep. Maria Cervania (D-Wake) expressed her reservations, stating, “I still have a lot of questions about this investment strategy and the level of commitment we’re making to it.” Related Reading: Code Wars: Cardano Claims The Crown From Ethereum In Core Development Concerns about the volatility of cryptocurrencies have prompted calls for a more cautious approach to integrating them into the pension fund. The legislation has sparked varied reactions outside the General Assembly. Governor Josh Stein has voiced his support for the bills, endorsing the expansion of the Treasurer’s authority over state investments. Conversely, representatives from the State Employees Association of North Carolina have expressed opposition, highlighting potential risks for state workers’ pensions. Following their passage in the House—with House Bill 506 receiving a vote of 110-3 and House Bill 92 passing 71-44—both bills now advance to the Senate for further consideration.

Starting this week, people across several US cities can now scan their eyes at World orbs and receive Worldcoin (WLD), a cryptocurrency backed by blockchain, for the first time. For years, Worldcoin has been available in select international markets, but it was notably absent from the US until now. The delay stemmed from regulatory hurdles and privacy concerns surrounding the collection of biometric data. The project’s reliance on iris scans raised questions about user privacy and data security, issues that had to be carefully addressed before launching in a market with strict data protection laws. World is live in the USA. Verify your World ID in six key cities now. pic.twitter.com/cju65pn7L7 — World (@worldcoin) May 1, 2025 World Offers 16 WLD for Eye Scans and 150 WLD Pioneer Grant Anyone who scans their eyes at a World orb will receive 16 WLD, and those who’ve already registered with the World app will get a “pioneer grant” of 150 WLD. The cryptocurrency can be transferred and traded within the World wallet app, and users can send WLD or other digital currencies through a private chat service integrated into the app. In addition to its app, World is taking another big step to bridge the gap between crypto and traditional finance. It’s partnering with Visa to launch a debit card that will convert WLD into fiat currency at checkout, a move that will make the cryptocurrency much more practical for everyday use. Iris-Scanning Process Takes 30 Seconds, Creating a Unique ID to Prevent Duplicate Registrations The iris-scanning process is simple but effective. Users step up to a World orb, which scans their face and iris in about 30 seconds, creating a unique “IrisCode” to verify their identity. This code ensures that no one can register more than once. The orbs will be accessible at various physical locations throughout the US, including Austin, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Nashville, Miami and San Francisco. The company has also rolled out a smaller version of the orb, the “orb mini,” which is more portable and resembles a smartphone. Integrations with Platforms Like Stripe and Razer Along with the debit card, the World wallet app will expand, offering over 150 mini-apps, including one from the prediction market Kalshi. Partnerships with companies like Stripe, Match Group (the parent of Tinder) and gaming platform Razer will also integrate Worldcoin into more platforms and services, broadening its use. Altman co-founded World in 2019, initially under the name Worldcoin, with the goal of creating a decentralized global identity system. The idea was to use iris scans and blockchain technology to combat fraud and bots online. By providing users with a secure, verifiable identity, Worldcoin hopes to create a more trustworthy digital ecosystem. As more locations open across the US, people will have more opportunities to register and claim their free WLD tokens.

As AI assistants become more sophisticated, companies are exploring new ways to deploy them beyond internal operations. Amazon, a major player in both cloud computing and AI development, has recently made a significant move that opens the door for widespread public adoption of AI-powered interactions. Understanding Amazon Q Business and the Anonymous Access Update Amazon Q Business is Amazon’s enterprise-focused AI assistant hosted on AWS. It’s designed to help employees within an organization by answering questions, summarizing documents, and completing tasks based on internal company data. However, a recent update fundamentally changes its potential use case by introducing support for anonymous user access. This new capability means that companies using Amazon Q Business can now configure their AI assistants to be accessible to users without requiring them to log in or authenticate. Effectively, this transforms Amazon Q Business from a purely internal tool into a platform capable of powering public-facing interactions. Enabling Public Facing Chatbots for Enhanced Customer Service The primary implication of anonymous access is the ability for businesses to build and deploy chatbots directly on their public websites, customer support portals, and other public-facing platforms. These public facing chatbots can leverage the power of Amazon Q Business to assist customers in various ways. Imagine a customer visiting a company’s website. Instead of searching through extensive documentation or waiting for a support agent, they can interact with an AI chatbot powered by Amazon Q Business. According to Amazon, this allows guest users to: Quickly find product information. Get technical answers. Navigate documentation efficiently. Troubleshoot issues through self-service. This capability streamlines the customer experience, providing instant access to information and support, potentially reducing the load on human support teams. The Role of AWS AI in Expanding Enterprise Capabilities Amazon Q Business is built on AWS AI infrastructure, leveraging Amazon’s extensive cloud computing and machine learning resources. This provides a robust and scalable foundation for deploying AI assistants. For businesses already utilizing AWS, integrating Amazon Q Business is a natural extension of their cloud strategy. Companies can configure their Q Business applications to ingest specific data sources, such as support documents, FAQs, product manuals, or internal knowledge bases. This ensures the chatbot’s responses are grounded in the company’s actual information, providing accurate and relevant answers to customer queries. The pricing model for Amazon Q Business applications with anonymous access is consumption-based, meaning companies pay based on usage, which can be beneficial for managing costs, especially with variable public traffic. Expanding Enterprise AI Solutions This move signifies Amazon’s commitment to expanding its portfolio of enterprise AI solutions . By making AI assistants accessible to the public, Amazon is addressing a key need for businesses looking to automate customer interactions and improve efficiency. Beyond basic Q&A, Amazon has been enhancing Q with ‘agentic’ features, allowing it to perform tasks across third-party applications on behalf of users. While the initial focus for public bots might be information retrieval, future iterations could potentially enable self-service task completion directly through the chatbot interface. Amazon’s Vision for Generative AI Applications Amazon views AI, particularly generative AI, as central to its future growth. CEO Andy Jassy has highlighted the company’s significant investment and activity in this space, noting that Amazon is building over 1,000 generative AI applications across its various businesses. The company’s AI revenue is reportedly growing at a ‘triple-digit’ year-over-year percentage and represents a ‘multi-billion-dollar annual revenue run rate’. Enabling public-facing AI assistants through Amazon Q Business is a clear step towards capitalizing on this growth and making sophisticated AI tools more accessible and practical for a wider range of businesses and their customers. In conclusion, Amazon’s update to Q Business, allowing anonymous user access, is a significant development for enterprise AI. It empowers companies to deploy powerful AI assistants as public-facing chatbots, promising improved customer service, greater efficiency, and a more interactive online experience.

44013302,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154349,1746076822,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Pinterest AI: Pinterest Battles ‘AI Slop’ with Powerful New Tools,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/pinterest-ai-fights-slop/,"In a digital landscape increasingly populated by AI-generated creations, platforms built on user contributions face a significant challenge. The struggle for authenticity and quality is real, echoing concerns that resonate even within the decentralized world where verifying digital assets and content is paramount. Pinterest, the popular visual discovery engine, is the latest major platform to directly confront this issue, announcing decisive steps to tackle what’s being widely referred to as ‘AI slop’. Why is Pinterest Fighting AI Slop? The problem is straightforward: an increasing volume of low-quality, often nonsensical or repetitive AI-generated content is flooding the platform. This ‘AI slop’ dilutes the human-made content that users originally came to Pinterest to discover and save. It makes finding genuine inspiration harder and degrades the overall user experience. For a platform built on curating aspirational images and ideas in areas like home decor, fashion, recipes, and art, this influx of synthetic imagery poses a direct threat to its core value proposition. User complaints have mounted, with discussions on forums like Reddit highlighting the frustration over the difficulty of distinguishing real Pins from AI fakes. How is Pinterest Addressing Generative AI? Pinterest is rolling out a multi-pronged approach to give users more control and transparency. Their strategy focuses on identification and filtering: AI Labeling: Images detected as AI-generated or significantly AI-modified will receive an ‘AI modified’ label in the bottom left corner when viewed in closeup. This is a crucial step for transparency. Detection Methods: Pinterest will analyze image metadata where available. More importantly, they’ve developed internal classifiers designed to automatically detect AI content, even if it lacks obvious metadata markers. Creator Appeals: Recognizing that automated systems aren’t perfect, Pinterest will offer creators a way to appeal if their content is incorrectly labeled. ‘See Fewer’ Option: An upcoming feature will allow users to signal that they want to see less generative AI content in specific categories. Initially targeting areas like beauty and art, which have seen a high volume of AI Pins, this option will expand over time. Clicking ‘see fewer’ on a Pin via the three-dot menu will inform Pinterest’s recommendation system to reduce similar AI content shown to that user. These tools represent a significant investment in content moderation specifically targeting the challenges introduced by widespread AI capabilities. What Does This Mean for Content Moderation? Pinterest’s actions underscore the growing necessity for robust content moderation strategies in the age of AI. Platforms that rely on user-generated content must find ways to maintain quality and authenticity against a tide of potentially infinite, low-effort AI creations. This move sets a precedent for how large platforms might handle the influx of AI content, balancing the potential for AI to be a tool for inspiration with the need to prevent it from overwhelming genuine human creativity. The challenge lies not just in detection but also in providing users with meaningful control over their feeds. While Pinterest acknowledges that generative AI can be a source of inspiration when used thoughtfully, their new tools prioritize empowering users to curate their own experience and easily identify synthetic content. As CTO Matt Madrigal stated, the goal is to help users make informed choices and ensure AI content enhances, rather than detracts from, their discovery journey. Conclusion: A Step Towards Cleaner Feeds Pinterest’s introduction of AI labeling and filtering options is a vital step in its battle against ‘AI slop’. By giving users transparency and control, the platform is directly addressing the user backlash and the threat posed by the devaluation of human-made content. This development highlights the broader industry challenge of managing AI-generated content and signals a necessary evolution in content moderation strategies for platforms worldwide. While more tools are planned, these initial steps provide hope for users seeking a cleaner, more authentic browsing experience on Pinterest.

Commenting on Strategy’s recent accumulation of BTC, they said that miners produce around 13,500 BTC per month, “But Strategy, using cheap debt and relentless capital, has outpaced that production for months,” in a kind of “synthetic halving.” They’re not just stacking , they’re “compressing Bitcoin’s supply curve from the outside,” the analysts said before concluding: “So yes, supply is drying up. But price moves when demand breaks the equilibrium. And with infinite fiat chasing a truly scarce asset, Bitcoin’s next move won’t be linear. It will be violent.

Alexei Zamyatin, the co-founder of the Bitcoin layer 2 Build on Bitcoin, told Cointelegraph at TOKEN2049 in Dubai that “the advantage of Bitcoin DeFi is that the market is much bigger, you have a much bigger retail user base that you can tap into.” “It’s not easy to convert it, but if you manage to win in Bitcoin DeFi, you win the entire market.” Zamyatin said the 300 million Bitcoin users would mean DeFi services on the blockchain would “outgrow everything we've seen so far in Ethereum and Solana.” Build on Bitcoin is one of the firms looking to win market share, offering a hybrid layer 2 solution that combines Bitcoin’s security with Ethereum DeFi capabilities via BitVM, a platform that processes Turing-complete Bitcoin contracts. Zamyatin argued that Bitcoin-native bridges are necessary for DeFi on Bitcoin as the blockchain’s security is strong, but it lacks the human talent, tools and network effects of Ethereum. Alexei Zamyatin speaking with Cointelegraph’s Ezra Reguerra at Token2049. Source: Cointelegraph Zamyatin said Bitcoin ( BTC ) yield and stablecoin products are driving strong demand for Bitcoin-based DeFi. “A lot of institutions that are buying Bitcoin now usually have to find yield on the assets they hold. So Bitcoin yield is becoming a very hot and highly sought-after thing.” Demand for Bitcoin-backed stablecoins is also skyrocketing because Bitcoin is the “best collateral,” Zamyatin added. What if we tokenized the Bitcoin ETF so institutions could get access to DeFi yields? pic.twitter.com/2HCpwbCZDS — alexei (@alexeiZamyatin) April 10, 2025 Bitcoin staking has become the main DeFi use case outside of payments, which involves Bitcoin holders locking their coins in self-custodial vaults or extractable one-time signatures to earn staking rewards on proof-of-stake blockchains like Ethereum. The Babylon Protocol is currently leading this market with $4.64 billion worth of value locked, representing nearly 80% of all value locked on Bitcoin, DefiLlama data shows. Bitcoin’s DeFi TVL is still a fraction of the $54.6 billion worth of value locked on Ethereum. Bridging solutions a controversial topic Zamyatin acknowledged the numerous hacks on blockchain bridges, but argued most of those incidents resulted from teams failing to manage their private keys, rather than from smart contract vulnerabilities . While competition in the retail market is wide open, Zamyatin noted that many institutions still hesitate to use bridges, that allow users to move value between incompatible blockchains. Related: Bitcoin NFTs, layer-2 and restaking hype ‘completely gon e’ Efforts have been made to increase the number of bridge signers from five to 50 in some cases, Zamyatin noted. However, institutions have been reluctant to adopt these solutions because they often don’t know who’s signing the transactions. For example, the Ren Protocol’s RenBTC operates via a decentralized network of nodes called Darknodes, which sign transactions to lock BTC and mint RenBTC to use on other chains. However, institutions continue to avoid these protocols due to the degree of anonymity involved and instead opt to use trusted custodians like BitGo and Coinbase Custody for such activities.

The spotlight was on SEC’s changing stance under new leadership, the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, and the growing institutional interest in crypto. The Significance Of Hidden Road Acquisition Deaton views Ripple’s acquisition of HiddenRoad as an important example of how traditional finance is blending with decentralized finance (DeFi). Ripple recently agreed to acquire Hidden Road, a prime brokerage firm, for $1.25 billion, marking a major move in the digital asset industry. Hidden Road, now approved by FINRA as a U.S. broker-dealer, allowing it to expand into areas like clearing and prime brokerage. This deal will help Ripple grow its presence in the financial industry and offer more services to big financial players. The deal is expected to close in the coming months, pending regulatory approval. Institutions Embrace DeFi, Bitcoin & XRP Stay Stable He points out that institutions and banks, which once saw DeFi as a threat, are now figuring out how to take advantage of it. He also notes that Bitcoin and XRP stayed stable, even with issues like trade wars, thanks to growing institutional support “There’s always risk, but I just don’t see how you can’t be bullish on several of these big tokens like XRP and BTC,” he said. They also discussed the rising institutional interest in digital assets, especially Bitcoin. The approval of Bitcoin ETFs was highlighted as a major milestone for crypto’s mainstream adoption.

Solana leads the charge with a 90% chance of US regulatory approval for a spot ETF by 2025, up from 70% earlier this year. XRP and Dogecoin have also seen their approval odds climb, driven by growing institutional interest, an influx of ETF filings, and a shift in regulatory posture under the current administration. As the SEC faces upcoming review deadlines, the altcoin ETF landscape is rapidly evolving. XRP Eyes $3.74 Breakout as ETF Optimism Fuels Investor Momentum XRP is showing signs of a potential breakout as investor sentiment turns increasingly bullish. Market analysts and traders are closely watching the token’s price action, with many citing a confluence of technical patterns and regulatory optimism that could see the altcoin retest its April high of $2.36—and potentially rally as high as $3.74 in the short term. At the time of writing, XRP is trading around $2.20 and is locked within a classic ”falling wedge” pattern on the daily chart, a technical formation often associated with trend reversals to the upside. This bullish setup is characterized by two converging trendlines that connect lower highs and lower lows, signaling a weakening of bearish momentum. A confirmed breakout above the wedge’s upper trendline, currently sitting at $2.40, could trigger a rally of up to 71%, with a projected target of $3.74 based on pattern measurements. XRP/USD daily chart (Source:TradingView) Adding fuel to this momentum is the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which currently hovers above its midline. This technical signal reflects that buying pressure remains strong and that the overall trend still favors a continuation to the upside. However, for XRP to realize this bullish potential, it must first maintain support at the $2.20 level and then break through the critical resistance band between $2.80 and $3.00. Market watchers view this zone as a major supply wall that previously triggered heavy selling activity. Despite short-term volatility, several prominent analysts remain confident in XRP’s ability to not only retest former highs but push significantly beyond them. Trader Dark Defender recently stated that XRP is moving in accordance with an Elliott Wave structure, suggesting that the current correction phase is part of a larger bullish wave cycle. According to Defender, the recent dip is a healthy part of XRP’s long-term price structure and paves the way for further gains. Another bullish voice, trader Allincrypto, has made a bold prediction that XRP could eventually surge to $19.27 based on long-term chart projections. Referencing the same falling wedge pattern, Allincrypto described the recent retracement as “textbook perfect,” reinforcing the narrative of a continuation rally ahead. ETF Approval Odds Improve Sharply Beyond the technical landscape, macro-regulatory developments are giving XRP an additional tailwind. The growing likelihood of a US-approved spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) has become a major narrative, with Bloomberg senior ETF analysts now placing the odds of approval in 2025 at 85%. This marks a notable increase from the 65% probability projected just two months ago. The shift in sentiment is attributed to the recent leadership changes at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which many market participants interpret as signaling a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment. ETFs from prominent asset managers like Grayscale, Bitwise, WisdomTree, Canary, Franklin Templeton, and 21Shares are currently under review. Betting markets also echo this optimism. On Polymarket, the probability of an XRP ETF approval by the end of 2025 has jumped to 80%, up from 63% just a week earlier. This surge reflects growing investor confidence in the regulatory green light, which could potentially unlock a wave of institutional capital and drive XRP demand to new heights. XRP ETF approval odds on Polymarket (Source: Polymarket) However, not all hurdles have been cleared. On April 29, the SEC delayed its decision on Franklin Templeton’s application, resetting the next review date to June 17. While this postponement introduces short-term uncertainty, analysts generally agree that the delay is procedural rather than indicative of rejection. Institutional Demand on the Horizon The broader implications of a spot XRP ETF are substantial. Approval would provide institutional investors with a regulated and familiar entry point into the XRP market, potentially transforming the token’s liquidity profile and overall demand. Just as spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs have helped drive inflows from traditional finance, a greenlit XRP product could mark a major milestone in the asset’s journey toward mainstream adoption. For now, XRP remains at a technical crossroads. Traders are watching closely for a breakout above the falling wedge, which could serve as the catalyst for another leg higher. Meanwhile, the regulatory drumbeat continues to echo in the background, offering a unique blend of chart-driven opportunity and fundamental tailwinds. Bloomberg Raises Solana ETF Approval Odds to 90% as Altcoin ETF Wave Gains Momentum In related news, the likelihood of US regulators approving a spot Solana (SOL) ETF by 2025 has surged dramatically, according to a new forecast from Bloomberg Intelligence. In an April 30 update posted to X, Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas revealed that the firm now assigns a 90% probability for a Solana ETF getting the green light from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) next year—up from just 70% in February. This significant revision reflects what Bloomberg analysts describe as an improving regulatory landscape for digital assets in the United States. Alongside Solana, the odds of ETF approval for other major altcoins like XRP and Dogecoin have also improved, now standing at 85% and 80%, respectively, according to the latest Bloomberg estimates. As of April 30, six asset managers—including Grayscale, VanEck, and 21Shares—have submitted applications to launch Solana-based ETFs. The same number of issuers are pursuing ETFs tied to XRP, while three firms have filed to list Dogecoin ETFs. In total, up to 70 crypto ETF filings are now awaiting review by the SEC, marking an unprecedented level of institutional interest in altcoin-backed investment products. According to Bloomberg, the SEC has until October to deliver final decisions on many of the pending applications. While the regulatory body has a history of extending deliberations, the political climate and growing demand from both retail and institutional investors are exerting pressure to expedite approvals. The surge in applications also follows the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s (CME) move in March to list Solana futures—an event that analysts and industry insiders see as a potential precursor to spot ETF approval. Improved Outlook for XRP and Dogecoin The renewed optimism is not limited to Solana. Bloomberg has also raised the odds of approval for ETFs tied to XRP and Dogecoin, noting that investor interest and institutional infrastructure around these assets have grown substantially. XRP has benefited from its partial legal victory over the SEC and has since re-entered the conversation as a candidate for wider institutional adoption. Six XRP ETF filings are currently on the SEC’s docket, mirroring the level of interest seen in Solana. Meanwhile, Dogecoin—a cryptocurrency born as a meme but now supported by figures like Elon Musk and used in experimental payment systems—has seen increasing legitimacy in financial markets. In April, Nasdaq requested permission to list a 21Shares ETF holding Dogecoin, reinforcing the growing institutional appetite for the asset. Despite the enthusiasm, analysts caution that final approvals may not come until late 2025 or early 2026, depending on how quickly the SEC moves through its review process. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart previously noted that the agency often takes between 240 and 260 days to fully assess such filings. Political Winds Favor Crypto The regulatory optimism is closely tied to the Trump administration’s evolving stance on digital assets. Since returning to office, President Trump has moved to replace SEC leadership and reduce what many view as excessive scrutiny over the crypto industry. These actions have been met with praise from pro-crypto lawmakers and industry groups who have long called for clearer guidelines and fairer treatment. This changing environment has energized asset managers, who see altcoin ETFs as the next logical step following the successful launch of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Analysts say approval of these products would open new doors for institutional capital to flow into the broader crypto market, potentially boosting prices and deepening market liquidity.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|REGULATION|SOL|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-01 05:30:00

Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 1.15% on Thursday to surpass 36,200, reaching a one-month-high. The Japanese yen depreciated past 143.5 per dollar on Thursday, sliding for the third straight session after the Bank of Japan kept its policy rate unchanged at 0.5%, in line with expectations. The Bank of Japan kept its key short-term interest rate unchanged at 0.5% during its May meeting, maintaining the highest level since 2008 and in line with market expectations. The central bank also slashed its growth and inflation forecasts, reducing the likelihood of future rate hikes. The BOJ now sees full-year GDP growth of 0.5% for 2025, down from January's forecast of 1%. The au Jibun Bank Japan Manufacturing PMI rose to 48.7 in April 2025, up from a flash estimate of 48.5 and March’s 12-month low of 48.4, marking a 10th straight month of contraction, due to weaker demand and worsening concerns about U.S. tariffs. Japan’s consumer confidence index fell to 31.2 in April 2025 from 34.1 in March, marking the fifth consecutive monthly decline and the lowest level since February 2023. China ( SHCOMP ) market closed, the offshore yuan traded around 7.27 per dollar, holding steady for a second straight session in thin trading due to the Labor Day holidays, while investors remained cautious as recent PMI data signaled early signs of strain from Trump’s tariffs. Hong Kong ( HSI ) market closed India ( SENSEX ) market closed Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.24% to below 8,120 on Thursday, ending a five-day winning streak, as mining and energy stocks declined amid softer commodity prices. The Australian dollar climbed above $0.64 on Thursday, building on gains from the previous session following the release of strong trade balance data. Australia reported a trade surplus of A$6.9 billion in March, significantly higher than February’s downwardly revised A$2.85 billion and beating market expectations of A$3.13 billion. Supporting the currency further, April data showed that manufacturing activity continued to expand, with new orders rising at their fastest pace in nearly two and a half years—a positive sign for domestic demand. Taiwan on Wednesday unexpectedly raised its 2025 economic growth forecast to 3.6%, up from 3.14%, following a strong first-quarter performance driven by a surge in exports, particularly in tech, ahead of potential U.S. import tariffs. In the U.S., on Wednesday, all three major indexes ended mixed. The S&P 500 and Dow reversed early losses, rising 0.1% and 0.3%, respectively to extend their winning streak to seven days, while the Nasdaq closed 0.1% lower. Investors shrugged off recession concerns despite data revealing the first quarterly economic contraction in three years. U.S. stock futures rose sharply on Thursday, fueled by robust earnings from two major tech giants: Dow +0.55% ; S&P 500 +0.96% ; Nasdaq +1.43% .

While Ripple has not confirmed the bid, it fits in with the company’s broader expansion push, which included its recent $1.2 billion acquisition of prime brokerage Hidden Road. Ripple is also emerging from regulatory headwinds after settling with the SEC. Meanwhile, Tether is planning to launch a new US-focused stablecoin product by late 2025 or early 2026, depending on legislative progress. The firm is positioning itself as a responsible partner to US regulators while also still maintaining dominance with its $150 billion USDT. The US Treasury predicts that the stablecoin market cap could surge to $2 trillion by 2028, due to the sector’s importance in the global financial system. Ripple's Quiet Power Move Rejected Ripple reportedly made a bid of up to $5 billion to acquire Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, but the offer was rejected for being too low. This is according to a Bloomberg report on April 30. The attempted acquisition came just weeks after Circle filed for an initial public offering in the United States, which indicates a strategic move by Ripple to expand its footprint in the stablecoin market. While the deal was not accepted, it is not clear whether Ripple plans to submit a new offer. The company still has to confirm or deny the report, and no comment was received from Circle either. Ripple was last valued at $11 billion in 2024—a figure CEO Brad Garlinghouse has since called outdated—and has been on a serious acquisition streak. Earlier in April, it acquired prime brokerage firm Hidden Road for $1.2 billion to enhance trading activity related to XRP and the XRP Ledger. This aggressive expansion comes as Ripple begins to resolve long-standing legal challenges. A court ruling in August of 2024 found Ripple liable for $125 million in its case with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which was originally filed back in 2020. However, in March, Garlinghouse stated that the SEC will not appeal the ruling, which resulted in Ripple agreeing to pay a reduced sum of $50 million. The company has also been increasingly active in certain political circles. Garlinghouse and Ripple’s chief legal officer, Stuart Alderoty, reportedly met with US President Donald Trump earlier this year. Ripple also contributed $5 million to Trump’s inauguration fund and was represented at official events on Jan. 20. Tether Eyes New US Stablecoin Launch New things are in the works for other stablecoin issuers as well. Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin by market cap, is planning to launch a new stablecoin product specifically for the United States market as early as this year. In an April 30 interview with CNBC , CEO Paolo Ardoino stated that the move could happen by the end of 2025 or early 2026, depending on how quickly US lawmakers advance legislation regulating stablecoins. While USDT already dominates the global stablecoin market with a nearly $150 billion market cap and approximately 66% market share, its use in the United States is still limited, where Circle’s USDC is more prevalent. Paolo Ardoino during his interview with CNBC Ardoino said that Tether is working closely with US regulators and law enforcement agencies to position itself as a responsible player in the financial system. He pointed out that Tether sees itself as an exporter of the US dollar through digital rails, and described the dollar as “the best product the United States ever created.” Tether generates revenue by accepting US dollars to mint USDT and investing those funds into liquid and yield-generating assets like US Treasury bills. The company recorded a net income of close to $14 billion in 2024, which made it the most profitable stablecoin issuer. Despite the growing traction of USDC, especially after President Donald Trump’s election victory, Tether is still very confident in its dominant position. Ardoino explained that USDT was originally designed to serve users in emerging markets, like small villages in Africa or merchants in Istanbul. However, for the US market, the company is working on a “different product” that is more tailored to domestic needs. Analysts at Web3 research firm Nansen still firmly believe that the stablecoin sector is likely to follow a “winner-takes-most” dynamic, which suggests that USDT’s lead may continue even amid rising competition. Stablecoin Market Set for Massive Expansion With all of these latest developments, US dollar-pegged stablecoins could see their combined market cap surge to around $2 trillion by 2028. This is according to the United States Department of the Treasury’s Q1 2025 report that was released on April 30. Although the current stablecoin market cap sits at roughly $230 billion, the Treasury believes evolving market conditions could accelerate growth over the next three years. These digital assets have become widely used as on-chain cash equivalents and are increasingly seen as a modern payment mechanism. A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that is specifically designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to a traditional asset, like the US dollar. For example, 1 USDT or 1 USDC is typically equal to 1 USD. This stability makes stablecoins very useful for payments, trading, and storing value without the volatility of other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Conceptual spectrum of stablecoins’ impact (Source: US Treasury ) The report also shed some light on the rise of tokenized money market funds, which offer yield-bearing alternatives to stablecoins. However, stablecoins are still deeply embedded in the blockchain economy. This latest commentary from the Treasury is another step in the US government’s growing embrace of blockchain innovation, after President Donald Trump’s second-term inauguration in January. In a December report, the Treasury already acknowledged that cryptocurrency could form the foundation of a new financial infrastructure and could also drive greater demand for US Treasurys. Stablecoin issuers like Tether and Circle invest fiat reserves in short-term, liquid instruments like Treasury bills and repurchase agreements. The Treasury revealed in December last year that this practice modestly increased demand for short-dated Treasurys. The April report also suggests that upcoming legislation will likely formalize these practices by requiring stablecoin issuers to hold short-term government debt, strengthening the connection between digital dollars and the traditional financial system. The growing use of stablecoins, however, could also exert some pressure on retail banks to offer higher interest rates to attract depositors. The current state of the stablecoin market (Source: US Treasury ) As of late April, Tether’s USDT is still the dominant player in terms of market share and its market cap of around $150 billion.

The business, which claimed to operate a mining service where customers paid to mine crypto and receive the resulting income, was accused of scamming users across several countries, including Estonia, Mauritania, Iran, New Zealand, Poland and Romania. The complaints were first brought to the attention of Action Fraud, which is the UK’s national fraud and cybercrime reporting centre. Victims claimed they had not received the mining services they had paid for, and many also faced further demands for additional payments. Upon investigation, authorities discovered that BTCMining Limited did not have a legitimate registered address in the UK, a red flag in any business operation.

David Usher, chief investigator for the Insolvency Service, pointed to the global nature of the fraud. “The fact that BTCMining Limited was attracting customers globally makes our intervention particularly important,” Usher said. “We acted on the complaints before their reach could have affected countless more individuals. It’s vital that the public, both here in the UK and abroad, are protected from companies acting in this way.” Efforts to Contact BTCMining’s Director Fail, Raising Concerns Over Wider Impact Investigators were unable to contact the company’s director, Stibich Martins Yhaicha Luzia. He had been the sole director since the company’s incorporation in Jan. 2024. Attempts to reach him through known email addresses and telephone numbers were unsuccessful. Additionally, the company’s websites became inactive or provided no new contact details. The director’s contact address, listed with Companies House, was a residential property. The occupants were unaware of the business and had not given permission for their address to be used. Although six complaints have been formally lodged with Action Fraud, authorities believe the actual number of victims could be much higher. The complaints revealed that customers collectively lost more than $18,000. However, this figure may only represent a fraction of the total financial impact. Investigators are concerned that more individuals may have been affected. These potential victims have yet to come forward.

He said Bitcoin and other digital assets were “another tool in the tool box.” He also noted the agency aims to give President Donald Trump a decisive intelligence advantage for his decision making. Jayellis also argued that Bitcoin was pseudonymous despite popular belief the digital assets were anonymous.

He added there’s a lot of work the CIA does with law enforcement to track illicit crypto payments by bad actors, whether they are drug cartels, terrorist groups, or outlaw regimes. Jayellis acknowledged that Bitcoin is an area of technological competition where the CIA needs to ensure that the U.S. is “strategically positioned” against China and other adversaries. He also argued that the U.S. needs to ensure it is a leader in the crypto space internationally. “Bitcoin is here to stay. Cryptocurrency is here to stay. As you know, more and more institutions are adopting it, and I think that’s a great trend and one that this administration has been obviously leaning forward to.” -Micheal Jayellis, Deputy Director of the CIA. The agency’s Deputy Director believes there is potential for law enforcement and the intelligence community to use cryptocurrencies to help track and disrupt what adversaries are doing. He also said the virtual asset is a target, something the CIA can “disrupt our adversaries’ use of it.” Jayellis acknowledged the agency also uses digital currency technology to collect more intelligence and gather more information about them. He argued that Bitcoin was similar to other advanced technologies, which the CIA needed to prioritize. The CIA’s deputy director mentioned that the CIA was working on the President’s agenda, which is “ the total elimination of the cartel .” He said that it was Trump’s priority and that it was what the agency seeks to achieve, “and we’re gonna do it.” Jayellis added that it would be a collective government effort, where all parts of the U.S. government would play a role in taking down the cartel threat. The former general counsel of the National Security Agency maintained that the threat was also an international problem, similar to the threat the CIA had successfully fought for the past two decades. He said the agency needs to ensure no gaps between intelligence and law enforcement in disrupting those networks before the threat reaches the U.S. borders. Jayellis says China is the CIA’s top priority President Trump understands that we can’t pass the American Dream onto the next generation if we let China dominate us. He’s the first President of my lifetime to call China a threat to our American way of life. They’re our biggest enemy and it’s past time we fight back. pic.twitter.com/DYM1ztmGlP — Senator Jim Banks (@SenatorBanks) April 9, 2025 Jayellis gave President Trump credit for being the first to realize and point out to people that China has been competing in an unfair way. He added that Trump was the first to recognize that China was also breaking the rules on trade, international property theft, and cyber security. He condemned the previous U.S. Presidents for their policy to “enable the peaceful rise of China,” but noted Trump was the first to say it was absolutely wrong. Jayellis argued that although countries like North Korea, Iran, Russia, ISIS, and Al Qaeda are a threat to the U.S., “China is the existential threat to the United States” in the economic and technological realm. The CIA’s deputy director noted the agency’s aim is to give U.S. President Donald Trump a decisive intelligence advantage. He revealed China was a “tough target ” for the intelligence community to operate in and collect on. Jayellis said it was the CIA’s top priority to give the President the best possible intelligence on China and every other country in the world. The CIA’s executive also noted that the agency’s goal is to give the U.S. a decisive advantage in the global technological competition in all fields, including quantum computing, AI, semiconductors, and biotechnology, against China.

CertiK said in an April 30 X post that a total of $364 million was lost to exploits, hacks and scams in April, jumping from the $28.8 million recorded by CertiK in March . The firm added that white hat exploiters had returned around $18.2 million from exploits on the crypto protocols KiloEx, Loopscale and ZKsync, which brought down the month’s total. The largest hack in April, and the fifth largest to date, involved an elderly US individual who lost 3,520 Bitcoin ( BTC ), valued at $330.7 million. The Bitcoin was stolen from their wallet after a hacker used advanced social engineering tactics to gain access on April 30. Excluding that attack, April’s crypto losses were $34 million, a 21% jump from March. CertiK said phishing scams, bolstered by the Bitcoin heist, was the main culprits for losses while social engineering, access control hacks and price manipulation exploits rounded out the top four types of attacks that stole the most value. Crypto losses in April spiked to $364 million, a 1,163% increase compared to last month. Source: CertiK February still has the most significant number of crypto losses for the year so far, with $1.53 billion. Most of that was from the $1.4 billion Bybit hack by North Korea’s Lazarus Group, which also holds the crown for the largest crypto hack ever. Hackers return some funds Over $18 million was returned for the month. Decentralized exchange KiloEx suspended platform operations after suffering a $7.5 million exploit; however, on April 15, the exploiter returned all the stolen funds, only four days after the attack. The ZKsync Association also r ecovered $5 million worth of stolen tokens from an April 15 security incident involving its airdrop distribution contract.

Losses to crypto scams, exploits and hacks were declining in the final days of 2024, with December registering the smallest amount stolen at $28.6 million, compared to $63.8 million in November and $115.8 million in October.

The company has filed to list on Nasdaq under the ticker PCAPU, with each $10 unit comprising one Class A share and a fraction of a warrant — a standard setup in SPAC deals. Aiming for Crypto, Fintech, and Financial Innovation ProCap will seek to acquire companies in fintech, digital assets, and financial services — sectors where Pompliano has long-standing ties through his investments, podcast, and media presence. While no specific acquisition target has been named, the filing notes a preference for businesses with strong growth potential and a competitive edge in their space. Pompliano’s strategy is unique: he’s bringing content, capital, and community into the deal. With millions of followers, a widely read newsletter, and a top-ranked crypto podcast, Pompliano believes his media reach will drive deal flow and investor trust, setting ProCap apart from typical SPACs. However, the structure heavily favors Pompliano. He controls the sponsor entity and has secured a large chunk of founder shares for a nominal price. These shares could be worth millions if the SPAC closes a successful merger — a common setup that has previously sparked criticism in the SPAC world. Crypto Market Timing in Pompliano’s Favor? Crypto-focused SPACs have seen uneven results in recent years. But with Bitcoin recently topping $94,000 and institutional momentum building, ProCap’s timing may be better aligned with market optimism. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Donald Trump’s 2025 Tax Plan Could Spark a 1000% XRP Price Rally, Analyst Claims , The crypto community is divided. Some, like investor Mark Neuman , view the move as a revival of the SPAC trend, calling this the “bottom” and praising Pompliano’s ambition. Others are less convinced, pointing to his past ties with failed projects like BlockFi. “BlockFi promoter whose rocket ship crashed,” one commenter wrote , warning investors to be cautious with first-time SPAC sponsors. Skeptics argue that the deal carries all the typical risks of SPAC investing — including potential dilution, regulatory delays, and uncertain returns for retail participants. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The Digital Assets Investment Act, known as House Bill 92, advanced on April 30 with a 71 to 44 vote and now moves to the state Senate for further consideration. Introduced in February by Republican House Speaker Destin Hall, the bill authorizes the treasurer to allocate up to 5% of the state’s total investments into designated digital assets. Crypto Investments Require Third-Party Oversight Under New NC Bill However, any such investment would require an independent third-party assessment to ensure that custody, risk management, and regulatory compliance standards are met. In a new amendment to the bill, the treasurer is also permitted to evaluate whether members of public retirement and deferred compensation plans could opt into digital asset investments through exchange-traded products (ETPs). In a related move, the House also passed the State Investment Modernization Act, or House Bill 506, with a near-unanimous 110 to 3 vote. The bill proposes the establishment of the North Carolina Investment Authority (NCIA), which would assume control of investment decisions from the state treasurer. If enacted, the NCIA—not the treasurer—would have the authority to invest in cryptocurrencies, contingent on board approval and third-party validation. North Carolina Treasurer Brad Briner has expressed support for both bills, according to local outlet NC Newsline. JUST IN: North Carolina #Bitcoin Reserve legislation passes the House. pic.twitter.com/pHy8b5dUsZ — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 30, 2025 The state is now positioning itself alongside Arizona in advancing crypto-related public investment frameworks. Arizona’s legislature recently passed two crypto reserve bills, SB 1025 and SB 1373, which now await Governor Katie Hobbs’ decision. If approved, North Carolina would become one of the few states actively integrating digital assets into public financial management. The adoption of Bitcoin has found notable momentum statewide in the U.S. According to data from Bitcoin Law, 47 Bitcoin reserve bills have been introduced across 26 states, with 41 currently active. Just recently, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear officially signed House Bill 701 , known as the “Bitcoin Rights” bill, into law—making the state one of the latest to enact legislation protecting digital asset users and operations. Public Companies Boost Bitcoin Holdings by 16% in Q1 2025 Publicly traded companies increased their Bitcoin holdings by 16.1% in the first quarter of 2025, signaling continued institutional interest in the leading cryptocurrency despite market volatility. According to crypto asset manager Bitwise, total corporate Bitcoin holdings climbed to approximately 688,000 BTC by the end of Q1, with companies adding 95,431 BTC over the three-month period. Bitwise reported the combined value of these holdings reached $56.7 billion, based on a Q1 closing price of $82,445 per Bitcoin—representing a 2.2% increase in value. More recently, healthcare technology firm Semler Scientific expanded its Bitcoin holdings with a fresh $10 million purchase, signaling a continued strategic pivot toward digital assets. The latest purchase brings the company’s total Bitcoin treasury to over 3,300 BTC, valued at approximately $300 million based on current market prices.

(Report),https://cryptopotato.com/why-was-ripples-5-billion-takeover-offer-rejected-by-circle-report/,"Ripple seems determined to make a big move in the stablecoin space, but its offer to acquire the second-largest such issuer was reportedly turned down. At the same time, its own stablecoin has stalled after the initial impressive launch, and its market cap remains under $320 million, according to CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. Circle Refuses The report claimed that the takeover attempt was halted in its tracks as Circle said the offer of somewhere between $4 billion and $5 billion was too low. Citing people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg said Ripple has no plans to raise the bid to acquire the company behind the second-biggest stablecoin, USDC. In contrast, the US-based crypto giant completed the acquisition of Hidden Road, a prime brokerage company, for $1.2 billion earlier this year, in what was described as one of the largest deals in the industry. The move is expected to be a game-changer for XRP as the asset and the network behind it, XRPLedger, will be used for post-trade settlement on some transactions, as CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed. Although the SEC is yet to publish an official confirmation and many believe it’s necessary to conclude the case, Galirnghouse announced in mid-March that the legal battle between his company and the US securities watchdog had come to an end as both parties refused to continue with their appeals. It seems that Ripple’s concluding legal troubles in the US have opened the door for the company to make some big moves, albeit one of them was reportedly rejected. RLUSD Struggles? While it was stopped from taking over the second-biggest stablecoin issuer, Ripple has already entered that growing industry niche. Recall that the firm launched its own such product late last year, called RLUSD . It started on the right foot after getting the regulatory green light in the US. Its market cap continued to increase in early April, jumping by 50% within days from $200 million to $300 million, as reported at the time. However, its progress has stalled since, and the asset’s market capitalization has gained less than $20 million in the following several weeks. Nevertheless, the volumes on CEX have surged by 30% over the past day to over $50 million, according to CMC. The post Why Was Ripple’s $5 Billion Takeover Offer Rejected by Circle?

Bitcoin Supply Shock? Not Just Yet Since April 21, BTC has been trading within a tight range between $91,500 and $95,800, offering few signals about its next directional move. While some analysts have repeatedly highlighted a potential supply shock that could drive Bitcoin’s price much higher, Aleman’s analysis offers a more cautious outlook. Related Reading: Bitcoin Demand Momentum Yet To Recover From Deep Negative Zone, Analyst Says According to Aleman, BTC reserves on centralized exchanges (CEXs) have declined steadily over the past year. Specifically, reserves dropped from 2,942,077 BTC on November 11, to 2,490,318 BTC as of April 28 – marking a 15.35% decrease in just five months. During the same period, Bitcoin’s Realized Capitalization – a metric that calculates the total value of BTC based on the price at which each coin last moved – has surged from $669.32 billion to $883.03 billion. This reflects an increase in the actual capital invested in the Bitcoin network, rather than market speculation alone. Aleman explains that as BTC becomes more “expensive,” a purchase of approximately 500,000 BTC at current prices could potentially drive the cryptocurrency’s price to $130,000–$140,000. However, he cautions that such a scenario would likely trigger significant selling pressure from miners. He adds: This behavior could counteract the decline in exchange reserves, since historically, miners tend to sell more as the price goes up. So even if reserves keep falling, a price surge would likely encourage enough selling to partially offset that drop. The analyst concludes that a true supply shock in this market cycle is unlikely unless Bitcoin sees a massive influx of capital – enough to push its Realized Capitalization to three or four times its current level. Technicals Point Toward BTC Breakout Despite the low probability of a supply-driven rally, all is not lost for the leading digital asset. Several technical indicators point toward an impending bullish rally for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘Apparent Demand’ Makes Sharp Rebound – Will BTC Breakout Soon? Notably, Bitcoin’s weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) recently broke a long-standing downward trendline, indicating a potential momentum shift. This development could help BTC reclaim the $100,000 mark in the coming weeks. In addition, recent on-chain data shows that short-term holders are refraining from selling their BTC – even while in the red – which may signal growing investor confidence and a potential bullish reversal. At press time, BTC trades at $94,374, down 0.4% in the past 24 hours.

44014533,https://coinpedia.org/?p=449483,1746079505,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,Why Circle Rejected Ripple’s Bold $5 Billion Acquisition Bid?,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-circle-rejected-ripples-bold-5-billion-acquisition-bid/,"The post Why Circle Rejected Ripple’s Bold $5 Billion Acquisition Bid? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ripple’s bold $5 billion offer to acquire Circle, the issuer of USDC, has officially fallen through — and now the crypto world is buzzing with speculation. While the deal could have instantly positioned Ripple at the forefront of the stablecoin sector, Circle turned down the offer. Ripple’s $5B Offer: Top Reasons Why Circle Said No 1. Illiquid Ripple Equity Offer Insiders reveal that Circle wasn’t satisfied with Ripple’s offer and declined it, considering the valuation insufficient. According to Jungle Inc , Ripple likely didn’t offer the full amount in cash. Instead, a significant portion of the $5 billion bid may have come in Ripple equity, shares that are currently private, illiquid, and hard to value. For a company like Circle, already preparing for an IPO , trading its future for equity with uncertain market value wasn’t appealing. Although Ripple hasn’t followed up with a new bid, it’s still eyeing a possible deal. 2. Ripple’s Competing Stablecoin Ripple has already announced its own stablecoin, RLUSD , which will operate on both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum. As crypto analyst Stellar Rippler noted, acquiring Circle would have meant absorbing a direct competitor, however he also raised questions about overlap. Circle may have seen the move as a play to neutralize USDC and wasn’t ready to give up its lead in regulatory adoption and market trust. Moreover, Circle’s USDC is seen as a fully-reserved, regulated stablecoin, and acquiring it would mean Ripple could skip the slow adoption phase for RLUSD and instantly dominate liquidity. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Is Made in America, Here’s Why That Matters , 3. Circle’s Strong Pre-IPO Position As shared by John Deaton , Circle is well-funded with strong backers like BlackRock and Fidelity. Its pre-IPO shares are trading around $40, with a target IPO valuation of $5 billion. Circle was previously valued at $9B in a failed 2022 SPAC deal and raised funds at $8B in its 2022 Series F round. Given this position, Circle didn’t feel pressure to sell majorly since its own stock remains in high demand on the secondary market. 4. Regulatory and Market Edge Circle’s USDC is widely accepted in U.S. regulatory circles, with integrations across Visa, Stripe, and Robinhood. In a series of X post Stellar Rippler pointed out that Ripple could have instantly gained this infrastructure, but Circle wasn’t willing to trade it away, especially not for equity in a company launching a rival product. 5. Strategic Misalignment Analysts suggest this wasn’t about competition, but consolidation. Ripple wanted to fast-track its position in the stablecoin sector by acquiring USDC’s network and reputation. But as Stellar Rippler concluded, Circle saw more value in maintaining its independence rather than merging with a rival looking to reshape the market on its terms. In short, Ripple aimed high, but Circle wasn’t ready to be absorbed. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Ripple aimed to fast-track its entry into the stablecoin space by acquiring Circle and gaining control over USDC. What was the value of Ripple’s offer to Circle? Ripple reportedly offered $4–5 billion, though much of it was likely in illiquid Ripple equity rather than cash. Why did Circle reject Ripple’s acquisition offer? Circle declined due to strategic misalignment, regulatory edge, and confidence in its own upcoming IPO. Does Ripple have its own stablecoin? Yes, Ripple recently announced RLUSD, a new stablecoin built on the XRP Ledger and Ethereum. Will Ripple try to acquire another stablecoin firm? While no new offers have surfaced, Ripple may still seek strategic acquisitions to boost its stablecoin ambitions.",News|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|USDC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-01 06:05:05

The project, which aims to verify humans in the age of artificial intelligence, is initially coming to what it calls the “key innovation hubs” of Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville and San Francisco, according to an April 30 announcement. World offers a crypto token, Worldcoin (WLD), to those who verify their identity with its spherical device called The Orb, which scans a user’s face and eyes. The data can be used to make a World ID on the company’s platform to verify a user is human and to sign in to integrated platforms, which currently include Minecraft, Reddit, Telegram, Shopify and Discord. In addition to World’s US rollout, the company said at an event in San Francisco on April 30 that it would partner with Visa for a “World Visa card” to launch later this year for those who have scanned their eyeballs, which allows for payments using WLD tokens and other cryptocurrencies. Source: World Matchmaking with verified ID The online dating giant Match Group, which owns Tinder, Hinge, Match.com and Plenty of Fish, will also begin a pilot program testing out World ID for its apps. The firm said that the project aims to provide dating app users with the means of verifying that the profiles they interact with represent real people seeking real connections. Related: World competitor Billions Network launches non-biometric digital ID World has established separate partnerships with prediction market startup Kalshi and decentralized lending platform Morpho. Altman co-founded the project in 2019, when it was known as Worldcoin, to create a global identity verification system using the blockchain to combat fraud and bots. It rebranded to World in 2024 and currently has 26 million users globally, with 12 million of them verified through Orb scans. Source: World WLD prices initially jumped around 15% following the announcement. However, those gains have since been lost, with the token down more than 5% over the past 24 hours, trading at just over $1 at the time of writing. WLD is down more than 90% from its March 2024 all-time high of $11.74, according to CoinGecko.

Investors took their cue from Wall Street, where US stocks recovered from massive early losses to mark gains for the seventh day straight. Despite the ongoing uncertainty of President Donald Trump’s trade fight with China and other partners, Japan’s Nikkei 225 advanced 1.31% to 36,516. Traders digested the Bank of Japan ’s decision to leave its benchmark rate untouched, even as questions grow over how new and proposed U.S. tariffs could ripple through the world’s third-largest economy.

With China, South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, and much of Southeast Asia closed for the May 1 break, turnover across the region stayed light and cross-border flows were thin, leaving sentiment heavily reliant on headlines from Washington and New York. Asian stocks were heavily reliant on news from NY On Wednesday, the S&P 500 edged up 0.1% to 5,569.06, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3% to 40,669.36, and the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.1% to 17,446.34. It was a significant reversal after the S&P 500 dropped by 2.3% and the Dow cut 780 points in early trading. The early sell-off came after preliminary figures hinted that the US economy shrank in the first quarter, a stark reversal from the solid growth recorded late last year. Economists said many importers had rushed shipments ahead of expected tariff increases, distorting the numbers and igniting talk of “stagflation.” A combination of weak activity and stubborn inflation leaves the Federal Reserve with no easy response. Relief arrived later in the day when a separate report showed the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge slowed to 2.3% in March from 2.7% in February, moving nearer to the 2% target. The tariff dispute itself remains the wild card. Companies are struggling to predict costs as the administration shifts between announcing tariffs and hinting at rollbacks. “I’m not taking credit or discredit for the stock market,” Trump said Wednesday. “I’m just saying we inherited a mess.” The back-and-forth has already caused a lot of volatility in the market. During April, the S&P 500 briefly fell almost 20% below the record it set earlier this year, drawing comparisons with some of the darkest days of the Great Depression. The S&P 500 finished the month down only 0.8%, far milder than March’s drop, and now sits 9.4% beneath its peak. U.S. benchmark crude, on the other hand, slipped 10 cents to $58.11 a barrel, while Brent crude eased 5 cents to $61.01. In currencies, the dollar strengthened to 143.88 yen from 143.06 yen, and the euro slipped to $1.1308 from $1.1331.

The WSJ reported hours ago that the company is looking for someone to succeed Elon Musk for the CEO role at Tesla. Naturally, rumors started flying around and speculations as to why is this happening took shape. Many people argued that it’s an effort designed to calm investors in Tesla after the recent backlash against Musk because of his involvement with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk was quick to respond, denying the claims in the report and also saying that “it is an extremely bad breach of ethics that the [Wall Street Journal] would publish a deliberately false article and fail to include unequivocal denial beforehand by the Tesla board of directors. Meanwhile, the official Tesla account tweeted : Earlier today, there was a media report erroneously claiming that the Tesla Board had contacted recruitment firms to initiate a CEO search at the company. This is absolutely false (and this was communicated to the media before the report was published). The CEO of Tesla is Elon Musk and the Board is highly confident in his ability to continue executing on the exciting growth plan ahead. – Robyn Denholm Tesla’s stock price closed at a 3.38% loss yesterday, clocking in at $282.16.

According to data from CoinGecko , over 50% of all cryptocurrencies ever listed have now become inactive. Since 2021, nearly 7 million crypto coins have been listed on the platform. Out of these, about 3.7 million projects have stopped trading and are now considered dead. This means 52.7% of all cryptocurrencies tracked by CoinGecko, with most of these closures happening in 2024 and early 2025. 2025 Is the Worst Year So Far In just the first three months of 2025, around 1.8 million crypto coins have failed. This is the highest number of project shutdowns in a single year and makes up nearly half of all crypto failures since 2021. Experts say this big drop in crypto projects could be linked to market problems that started after Donald Trump became President again in January 2025, which caused crypto prices to fall. Meme Coins and Quick-Launch Tokens Flood The Market The total number of crypto projects has also increased in recent years. In 2021, there were around 428,000 projects listed. By 2025, that number had jumped to almost 7 million. A major factor behind this growth was the launch of pump.fun in 2024, a platform that made it extremely easy for users to create their own tokens. As a result, the market was flooded with meme coins and low-effort projects, many of which didn’t survive for long. Before 2024, the number of failed projects was much lower. But after the arrival of easy-to-use token-making platforms, the number of shutdowns jumped sharply. Along with token failures, major security breaches like the Mantra Crash and Bybit hack have shaken investor confidence.

The feature, unveiled during Token2049 in Dubai, converts crypto to stablecoins at checkout using Mesh’s proprietary SmartFunding technology. The system sidesteps the need for merchants to handle crypto directly, offering what Mesh calls a “plug-and-play” payment option through Apple Pay’s interface. This way, brick-and-mortar retailers and webshops can accept crypto payments without the need for building out the necessary infrastructure. Mesh plans to launch the feature later in the second quarter of the year. “We believe that as soon as crypto payments are as seamless as fiat payments, nothing is left to stop the mass migration of global commerce onto blockchain rails,” said Bam Azizi, CEO and co-founder of Mesh. Blockchain rails and stablecoins, which are crypto tokens pegged to the value of traditional currencies, have become increasingly central to payments. They offer faster, cheaper alternative to traditional channels, and are rapidly growing for remittances, payroll and commerce. Payments giant Stripe is testing a stablecoin tool following its acquisition of Bridge, while PayPal launched its own stablecoin.

This massacre transpired during the darkest days (for now) of US President Trump’s escalating trade war against the rest of the world. As his policy and intentions became clearer and he paused the tariffs against every single nation except for China, BTC started to recover and gained $20,000 in the next couple of weeks. Since it broke above $90,000, though, over a week ago, the asset has remained sluggish in a tight sideways channel between $93,000 and $95,000. There was a breakdown attempt yesterday, but the lower boundary held strong, and BTC is back testing the upper one now. According to several key metrics, this consolidation phase could be nearing an end, hinting at an upcoming substantial price move. Squeezing BBs Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted the reduced volatility as of late, which is shown by the squeezing Bollinger Bands. The momentum indicator, composed of three lines with the Simple Moving Average (SMA) in the middle, has tightened on the 4-hour BTC chart, and Martinez warned that “a major price move could be just around the corner.” The Bollinger Bands are squeezing on the 4-hour chart for #Bitcoin $BTC ! A major price move could be just around the corner. pic.twitter.com/uvrel12QVp — Ali (@ali_charts) May 1, 2025 Although the BBs are a secondary technical tool and do not provide a clear indication of the direction of the move, the analyst said BTC has a notable chance to head north if it remains above the key support of $93,198, which has held its price on a couple of occasions in the past week. Moreover, BTC could surge toward a new all-time high of around $114,230 if it breaks above $95,870, he added. If #Bitcoin $BTC breaks and holds above $95,870, the next key target, based on the MVRV Pricing Bands, is $114,230. pic.twitter.com/iKPJvVaUtA — Ali (@ali_charts) April 30, 2025 Accumulation Skyrockets The second and third signs hinting at an upcoming big BTC move are somewhat similar, but they are worth differentiating. On one hand, we have the growing accumulation of whales. As reported yesterday, these market participants had acquired $4 billion worth of bitcoin within just two weeks. On the other hand, there are the BTC ETFs, which broke the previous negative streak and recorded a positive one from April 17 to April 30. Although this trend came to an end yesterday, it was with a minor $56.3 million in outflows, which is far below the billions attracted before that. Martinez highlighted these substantial purchases and noted that the BTC Accumulation Trend Score has neared 1, which is a clear indication of larger entities going on a shopping spree. The #Bitcoin $BTC Accumulation Trend Score is nearing 1, signaling that larger entities, or a significant portion of the network, are actively accumulating. pic.twitter.com/eJavuF8Dmb — Ali (@ali_charts) April 30, 2025 Bonus: The number of bitcoins sitting on exchanges has been gradually declining , reaching a five-year low. While this is another bullish sign for the future price movements of the underlying asset, Swan’s analysts explained why it hasn’t reacted yet.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/is-elon-musk-leaving-tesla-how-will-dogecoin-be-affected-by-a-possible-separation-here-are-the-details/,"Despite rumors that Tesla was looking for a replacement for its high-profile CEO Elon Musk, Dogecoin has remained largely unaffected. Dogecoin Holds Steady as Elon Musk Denies Rumors He Will Step Down as Tesla CEO The memecoin, which is usually sensitive to Musk’s public statements and business developments, has shown little reaction to the controversy, trading between $0.16 and $0.17 over the past 24 hours, while broader crypto markets have been sideways over the same period. The Wall Street Journal reported that Tesla board members reached out to executive search firms about a month ago to explore options for a new CEO, citing concerns about Musk's increasing alignment with the Trump administration. According to the report, board members also asked Musk to publicly recommit to focusing on Tesla, but Tesla moved quickly to quash the rumors. “This is absolutely false (and was communicated to the media before this report was published),” the company wrote on its official X account early Thursday. “Tesla’s CEO is Elon Musk, and the Board of Directors is extremely confident in his ability to continue executing on the exciting growth plan ahead.” Musk reiterated the denial in a personal post, calling the story an “intentionally false article.” Musk’s influence on Dogecoin is well-documented. He has been a vocal supporter of the token for years, frequently referencing it in social media posts and interviews. Despite the occasional turmoil in Musk’s public and professional life, Dogecoin’s increasing resilience suggests that the token market is maturing beyond single-point dependency as Musk continues to remain an influential figure. *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin HODLer Whales Have Broken Their Silence Recently In a new post on X, CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has talked about how some old Bitcoin investors have shown movement recently. The on-chain indicator of relevance here is the “Spent Output Age Bands” (SOAB), which tracks the transaction activity related to a given ‘age band.’ An age band defines a time-range during which coins falling inside the band were last transacted on the network. The 1 day to 1 week band, for example, includes the part of the BTC supply that was last moved between 1 day and 1 week ago. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Demand Returning? Active Address Trend May Suggest So When addresses falling inside a particular age band make a transaction, the corresponding SOAB registers a spike. In the context of the current topic, the group of focus is the 3- to 5-year-old group. Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the SOAB of the cohort over the past day: As displayed in the above graph, the indicator has registered a large increase for the 3-year to 5-year age band, which implies the investors have just moved a huge amount of old coins. In total, the age band has been responsible for transactions involving 8,003 BTC. At the current exchange rate, this stack is worth more than $760 million in US dollars. Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they are to sell them in the future. This means that as holders mature into the older age bands, they become more resolute. The HODLers of the market (holding for more than 155 days) are known as the long-term holders. Considering that the age band from the chart involves coins older than three years, the investors holding them must be stalwart even by HODLer standards. Thus, to see these diamond hands break their long silence to move such a large stack could be a worrying sign for Bitcoin, if the motive here is for selling, as is often the case when long-dormant tokens shift. Related Reading: Dogecoin Could Rally To $0.74 ATH If Price Closes Month Above This Level, Analyst Says The movement from the 3-year to the 5-year age band has come as BTC’s recovery rally has stalled into flat price action. It’s possible that these whales think this may be their best chance of getting out with their profits, so they have decided to sell. The SOAB of this Bitcoin group and other old ones can now be worth keeping an eye on, to see if more of the resolute hands join in on the profit-taking. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $95,100, up almost 2% in the last seven days.

The letters misleadingly tell recipients they need to confirm their private seed phrases for a “critical security update,” according to reports posted on social media site X on April 29. Physical Letters Impersonate Official Communications Tech pundit Jacob Canfield uncovered the scam when he received such a letter to his home address. The scammers use Ledger’s official logo and business address, and also a reference number to make it look legitimate. It tells the recipients to scan a QR code and input their wallet’s private recovery phrase, stating that this will authenticate their device. The letter uses pressure measures, threatening that “failure to complete this required validation process may lead to limited access to your wallet and funds.” Security professionals caution that anyone who does this would be essentially surrendering total control of their cryptocurrency assets to cybercriminals. Breaking: New scam meta launched. Now they’re sending physical letters to the @Ledger addresses database leak requesting an ‘upgrade’ due to a security risk. Be very cautious and warn any friends or family that you know is in crypto and is not that savvy. pic.twitter.com/XoUAGQBJXt — Jacob Canfield (@JacobCanfield) April 28, 2025 Recovery Phrases: Keys To Crypto Kingdoms A seed phrase or recovery phrase is a list of up to 24 words that is the master key to a cryptocurrency wallet. Whoever comes into possession of this phrase has complete control of the corresponding wallet and is able to send all the funds to other wallets. These phrases are incredibly valuable for a target of scammers because of it. The hardware wallet firm also confirmed the letters were fake. Ledger issued the following statement after Canfield’s post: “Ledger will never call, DM [direct message], or request your 24-word recovery phrase. If it happens, it’s a scam.” The firm also warned customers against interacting with accounts purporting to be Ledger staff or anyone that provides assistance with fund recovery. Possible Connection To Previous Data Breach The mail scam can be linked to a significant security hack that occurred close to five years back. Hackers in July 2020 compromised Ledger’s database and revealed the personal details of over 270,000 clients. This is not the first time physical mail has been used by criminals to target users of cryptocurrency. In a 2021 Bleeping Computer report, several Ledger users reported receiving fake Ledger devices in the mail. Those fake devices were programmed to drop malware when plugged into a computer. The stolen data comprised names, phone numbers, and residence addresses – data through which this mail scam would be feasible. Canfield made this link in his social media announcement, pointing out that scammers seem to be targeting Ledger users whose information was hacked in that breach. The most recent mail scam is a development in strategy, a mix of conventional mail fraud with cryptocurrency theft strategies. Security researchers recommend that the owners of hardware wallets keep in mind that any legitimate firm will never request recovery phrases under any circumstances, even if a message appears to be official.

According to Bitcoin Laws data, that tracks the progress of crypto legislation in the US, Florida stands sixth in the race to become the first US state to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Source: Bitcoin Laws If passed, the bill would have multiple economic impacts, including diversification of state assets and attracting more crypto businesses.

Whether you’re holding a modest $2,350 portfolio or preparing for larger strategic plays, momentum in assets like Ethereum (ETH) , Solana (SOL) , Aptos (APT) , and Injective (INJ) is turning heads. With real-time price action validating technical setups, the outlook for May 2025 suggests rising confidence among investors—and rising opportunities. Ethereum and Solana Push Higher Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading around $1,830 , maintaining strength following a month of steady accumulation by whales and rising demand for infrastructure-related tokens. Analysts remain bullish, with ETH flashing a golden cross and transaction costs declining—factors that often signal the start of the next breakout phase. Forecasts remain optimistic for a move above $2,500 in the near term. Solana (SOL) , trading between $145 and $150 , is fresh off a 41% April gain , fueled in part by the approval of a Canadian spot ETF and renewed institutional interest. The key resistance at $180 remains in focus, with analysts pointing to $221 as a longer-term breakout target if current conditions hold. Long-term holder accumulation also supports a continued bullish structure. Aptos and Injective Emerge with Solid Foundations Aptos (APT) has made a strong comeback, climbing to $9.35 and delivering an 18% weekly gain . Its selection as the digital wallet provider for Expo 2025 Osaka has helped elevate the project’s visibility. Investors are tracking price action carefully, with technicals and sentiment aligning toward higher targets. Injective (INJ) remains a community favorite in decentralized finance infrastructure, trading with steady support even as broader market noise fluctuates. While April didn’t bring headline updates, Injective’s strong developer activity and solid foundation continue to draw interest from longer-term holders and traders.

In a new post, Tapiero tells his 129,100 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin may soar more than 90% of its current value due to likely Fed rate cuts to boost the economy. Tapiero believes the liquidity increase will be the catalyst to send Bitcoin to a new all-time high of $180,000. Among the economic metrics he looks at is the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond’s Expected Manufacturing Employment index, which has plummeted to levels seen only during economic crises. “Here we go again. More second-tier macro data signaling a rapid slowdown ahead. Largest drop ever – back to ’08 lows. It’s a Fed survey, so hard for them to ignore. Short rates at 4% are way too high. Same theme: more liquidity coming. BTC to $180,000 before Summer ’26… [The Richmond Expected Manufacturing Employment index is] just an indicator that shows we are at an extreme very rarely if ever reached. I search for these extreme outliers as they increase the odds that the slowdown is more severe than is currently priced in.” Source: Dan Tapiero/X Tapiero also says the worsening economic conditions will likely lead to more money printing, which will debase the US dollar. He believes the currency debasement will cause investors to pour into Bitcoin as a hedge. “Fed is playing with fire. Massive collapse in consumer expectations for the economy in the next six months (hits 54.4). Back to March 2009 lows, well below Covid panic lows. This is extreme data. Much lower rates and USD needed to offset fiscal austerity. Fiat debasement equals +BTC.” Bitcoin is trading for $94,277 at time of writing, flat on the day.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Trust Wallet’s new Stablecoin Earn feature aims to transform idle digital dollars into active opportunities, without compromising self-custody or simplicity. Stablecoins have long been considered the quiet workhorses of the cryptocurrency economy, stable in value, practical in use, yet often overlooked when it comes to unlocking their full financial potential. But as decentralized finance (DeFi) matures and stablecoins gain broader traction, new possibilities are emerging beyond simply holding digital dollars. Trust Wallet , one of the leading self-custody crypto wallets, is entering this space with its latest feature, Stablecoin Earn. Designed to turn idle assets into passive income, Stablecoin Earn allows users to access onchain yield opportunities without leaving the security of their wallet. To explore how this new feature fits into Trust Wallet’s broader vision and what it means for the future of everyday crypto use, we spoke with Eowyn Chen, the company’s CEO. 1. Stablecoins are evolving beyond being a store-of-value asset. What new opportunities does this shift create for everyday users? Stablecoins are becoming the bridge between traditional finance and web3. As they evolve from passive holdings into active financial tools, users can now access a wider range of opportunities: from earning yield on idle assets to participating in decentralized financial services like lending, payments, and even savings alternatives. This shift empowers everyday users to do more with their stablecoins without giving up control, whether it’s growing their digital savings, moving value globally, or interacting with DeFi applications in a safer, more familiar way. 2. What user behaviors or market signals led you to launch a native yield feature within Trust Wallet? We noticed that billions of dollars worth of stablecoins were simply sitting idle onchain, even as DeFi opportunities matured. Many users who trusted stablecoins as a store of value were not taking the extra step to put them to work, often due to complexity or risk concerns. Our goal with Stablecoin Earn is to remove those barriers: helping users unlock simple, transparent yield opportunities directly within their wallet, without losing custody of their assets. It’s about making web3 more useful and accessible for everyone, not just advanced users. 3. How does Stablecoin Earn extend Trust Wallet’s mission of promoting self-custody and web3 accessibility? A big part of our mission has always been to empower users through self-custody and easy access to web3 opportunities. Stablecoin Earn continues that by allowing users to grow their assets without relying on centralized intermediaries. Everything happens transparently onchain, and users retain full control at every step. By embedding this experience natively into the wallet, we make it easier for people to participate in DeFi safely and confidently, in line with our broader vision of building web2-level user experience on top of web3 foundations. 4. How does embedding onchain yield opportunities directly into the wallet lower barriers for DeFi adoption? For many users, DeFi can feel intimidating, navigating dApps, connecting wallets, understanding protocols, and managing risks can be overwhelming. By integrating yield opportunities directly into Trust Wallet’s native experience, we eliminate much of that complexity. Users no longer need to jump through multiple steps or platforms. They can simply discover, assess, and engage with trusted opportunities from within the wallet they already use, with the same security and self-custody principles they expect. It’s a major step toward making DeFi feel as simple and accessible as everyday fintech apps. You might also like: Trust Wallet tops crypto wallet downloads for March 2025 5. Stablecoin Earn integrates with various DeFi protocols, including Morpho and Kiln. What criteria guide your choice of DeFi partners for Stablecoin Earn? We take partner selection seriously. For Stablecoin Earn, we prioritize protocols that have strong reputations for security, transparency, and efficiency. Morpho and Kiln represent some of the leading efforts in optimizing onchain yields in a non-custodial, user-first way. Before any integration, we assess protocol risk models, smart contract audits, operational history, and alignment with our own self-custody principles. Our goal is to curate partners that offer users strong potential benefits without compromising safety or control. 6. Stablecoin Earn offers no lock-up periods, ensuring users full liquidity. How does Trust Wallet provide this flexibility alongside yield opportunities? The ability for users to deposit and withdraw at any time is core to how Stablecoin Earn is designed. We integrate with DeFi protocols that support liquid vault structures, allowing users to earn yield without committing to rigid lock-up terms. Behind the scenes, we work to surface only the opportunities where users maintain on-demand access to their assets. This ensures that users can benefit from yield opportunities while preserving the self-sovereign flexibility that is fundamental to Trust Wallet’s philosophy. 7. How are users’ funds managed once they interact with Stablecoin Earn, and what safeguards are in place to protect them from common DeFi risks? When users interact with Stablecoin Earn, their funds are deployed into selected DeFi strategies via smart contracts. We do not custody user funds. To mitigate risks, we carefully vet the protocols we partner with, prioritize those with strong security audits, and integrate clear transaction signing so users can see and understand every action taken. Additionally, we provide educational resources to help users make informed choices. While no system in our industry is without risk, transparency, smart contract security, and user control are the pillars of how we manage safety. 8. Are there plans to expand Stablecoin Earn with new stablecoins, blockchain networks, or additional earning strategies to further enhance the user experience? Of course, we want to give our users more options to put their assets to work without compromising self-custody. We’re exploring a number of options for Stablecoin Earn, including support for new stablecoins, additional blockchain networks, and stablecoins backed by real-world assets. We’re also looking into adding more vaults with varying risk profiles, as well as automated strategies and DeFi-native products for more advanced users. These efforts are still being shaped, but they reflect our ongoing commitment to bringing accessible, secure onchain opportunities to a broader audience .

44017292,https://invezz.com/?p=2699627,1746083405,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Pi Network price crashed in April: will Pi coin surge in May?,https://invezz.com/news/2025/05/01/pi-network-price-crashed-in-april-will-pi-coin-surge-in-may/,"Pi Network price crashed in April even as other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Fartcoin, Virtuals Protocol, and Solana bounced back. The token dropped by over 16% in April and dropped by almost 80% from the highest point in February. This article examines the reasons behind the Pi Coin’s price crash and what to anticipate in May. Why Pi Network price crashed in April The value of Pi plunged in April for several reasons. First, the coin plummeted as many pioneers continued to dump their tokens following the mainnet launch in February of this year. Second, the token crashed as concerns about dilution continued. Investors are concerned about the rising number of tokens coming online this year. Over 188 million tokens were released to the market in April. This dilution is expected to continue in the coming years. Over 235 million Pi Network tokens valued at over $140 million will be unlocked this month. Additionally, over 1.43 billion tokens are valued at $869 million over the next 12 months. Token unlocks are highly dilutive since they introduce new tokens to the market. The situation is even worse when there is not enough demand from investors. It is also worse when existing investors sell their coins, as is the case with Pi Network. Pi Network token unlock schedule The value of Pi fell as exchange listings remained elusive Third, Pi Coin price imploded as exchange listings remained elusive during the month. No major exchange has listed it, including Binance, a company whose customers voted overwhelmingly for its listing. Pi Network is now listed in exchanges like OKX, MEXC, and Bitget. While these are all big exchanges, major names like Binance, Coinbase, and Upbit have not listed it. This means that the coin is not available to millions of customers. Furthermore, the token plummeted as concerns about its tokenomics persisted. In addition to the future token unlocks, concerns have been raised that insiders hold the majority of the tokens and may easily dump them as happened with Mantra whose price crashed by over 90% within a day. Pi Network has millions of pioneers, and according to its tokenomics, these ones hold over 65 billion coins. The remaining 35 billion coins are largely allocated to the insiders. Ten billion goes to the foundation reserves, which the team controls. The team, headed by two people, also received 20 billion tokens, while the remaining 5% was allocated to liquidity, which the team also controls. Pi Network price chart Why Pi Coin price may surge in May While Pi Network price has crashed recently, there is a likelihood that it will bounce back by double or even triple digits in May. The primary reason is that we expect at least one centralized exchange to list it. The most likely one is HTX, the exchange that Justin Sun acts as the advisor and shareholder. HTX was the first exchange to launch a Pi Network IoU in 2021, a token that continued to trade until February. The exchange has been sending cues that it will list it soon. A look at its social media posts shows that PI has featured in at least three of them. HTX @HTX_Global · Follow Which crypto erupts green & melt faces? 2:07 PM · Apr 30, 2025 1.5K Reply Copy link Read 583 replies An HTX listing would likely result in a significant increase in the value of Pi. However, the most consequential exchanges would be Binance, Upbit, and Coinbase. Binance is the largest exchange in the world, while Upbit holds a significant market share in South Korea. Coinbase would let US customers participate in the Pi Network. Another reason the Pi coin price may surge is that it is currently in the accumulation phase of the Wyckoff Theory. This phase is characterized by sideways movement. It is then followed by the markup phase, where the fear of missing out (FOMO) reigns.

44016241,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154401,1746083415,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,AI Shopping: Revolutionary Steps by Visa and Mastercard,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ai-shopping-visa-mastercard/,"Artificial intelligence is rapidly changing industries, and now it’s making a significant impact on how we shop and pay. Traditional finance powerhouses, Visa and Mastercard, are diving headfirst into the world of AI shopping , promising a future where intelligent agents handle your purchases for you. This move signals a major shift in the payment landscape, bringing cutting-edge AI capabilities into everyday transactions. What is Visa’s Intelligent Commerce Initiative? Visa recently announced its Intelligent Commerce initiative, a significant step towards integrating AI into the shopping experience. The core idea is to enable AI agents to “find and buy” on behalf of consumers. Imagine an AI assistant that understands your preferences, finds the best deals, and completes transactions securely, all based on parameters you set. According to Visa, this initiative puts consumers in control. “Each consumer sets the limits, and Visa helps manage the rest,” stated Jack Forestell, Visa Chief Product and Strategy Officer. The goal is to make shopping more personal, secure, and convenient by leveraging AI. To achieve this, Visa is collaborating with a diverse group of technology leaders and innovative startups. These partners include: Anthropic IBM Microsoft Mistral AI OpenAI Perplexity Samsung Stripe And others… This collaborative approach highlights the complexity and potential of Visa AI initiatives in reshaping digital commerce. How Mastercard is Enabling AI Payment Agents Not to be outdone, Mastercard also revealed its plans to empower AI agents with payment capabilities through its new Agent Pay offering. Mastercard believes this will enhance generative AI conversations for both individuals and businesses by seamlessly integrating payments into the tailored recommendations and insights already provided by conversational AI platforms. Mastercard explains that this integration means an AI agent can go beyond just offering advice. For instance, if you’re planning a milestone birthday party, an AI agent could chat with you, curate outfit and accessory selections from various retailers based on your style, the venue, and even the weather. Based on your feedback, the agent could then proceed to make the purchase and recommend the most suitable payment method, such as using Mastercard One Credential. Mastercard is also working with key partners to scale what they term “agentic commerce.” Collaborations include: Microsoft, for developing new use cases. IBM, Braintree, and Checkout.com, focusing on other aspects of AI-powered shopping and payments. These efforts demonstrate Mastercard’s commitment to integrating payments deeply within the evolving landscape of conversational AI and AI payment agents . Is This Trend Unique to Visa and Mastercard? The push towards AI shopping agents is not exclusive to these payment giants. Several other major tech players are also exploring similar capabilities. Earlier this month, Amazon began testing its own AI shopping agent feature called “Buy for Me” with a subset of users. Companies like OpenAI, Google, and Perplexity have also showcased AI agents capable of browsing websites and assisting users with making purchases. OpenAI recently updated its ChatGPT search tool to provide an improved online shopping experience, indicating the growing importance of this use case for general-purpose AI platforms. This broader trend underscores the potential for Intelligent Commerce to become a standard feature of online interaction. What Are the Benefits and Challenges of AI Payment Agents? The introduction of AI payment agents offers several potential benefits: Convenience: Agents can handle repetitive tasks, saving users time and effort. Personalization: AI can tailor recommendations and shopping experiences based on individual preferences and history. Efficiency: Streamlined processes can make finding and purchasing items faster. Accessibility: AI interfaces could potentially make online shopping easier for individuals with certain disabilities. However, this new paradigm also presents challenges: Security: Ensuring the AI agents and the underlying platforms are secure against fraud and data breaches is paramount. Privacy: AI agents require access to user preferences and potentially sensitive financial information. Managing and protecting this data is critical. Control: Users need clear ways to set limits, monitor agent activity, and revoke permissions. Transparency: Understanding how the AI makes recommendations and decisions is important for user trust. Liability: Who is responsible if an AI agent makes an incorrect purchase or encounters an issue? Addressing these challenges will be key to the successful adoption of Visa AI and Mastercard AI initiatives. The Future of Intelligent Commerce The moves by Visa and Mastercard are significant because they integrate payment capabilities directly into AI-driven experiences. This isn’t just about AI helping you find something; it’s about AI completing the transaction for you. This development has broad implications for retailers, payment processors, and consumers. It could lead to new business models, change how brands interact with customers online, and potentially impact the role of traditional e-commerce platforms. As AI technology advances and becomes more integrated into our daily lives, the concept of Intelligent Commerce , where AI agents facilitate and execute purchases, is likely to grow. Visa and Mastercard are positioning themselves at the forefront of this evolution, aiming to ensure that their payment networks remain central to the future of shopping. While the full scope and impact of these AI payment agents are yet to be seen, their introduction marks a pivotal moment in the intersection of artificial intelligence and financial services, promising a more automated and personalized future for online transactions.

In just one month, the crypto world lost a massive $364 million to scams, hacks, and phishing attacks. Most of the damage, around $337 million, came from phishing alone. But some white-hat hackers helped return about $18.2 million. Let’s dive deep into the details. $364M Lost to Scams According to a recent update from blockchain security firm CertiK, the crypto world lost nearly $364 million to various scams, hacks, and phishing attacks, making it one of the most damaging months so far this year. #CertiKStatsAlert Combining all the incidents in April we’ve confirmed ~$364M lost to exploits, hacks and scams after ~$18.2m was returned.

More… pic.twitter.com/0GBcSZgdPB — CertiK Alert (@CertiKAlert) April 30, 2025 And most of this loss, about $337 million, was caused by phishing, which means people were fooled into giving away their private info or wallet access. One major case stood out. A senior U.S. citizen lost 3,520 Bitcoin , worth over $330 million, in a phishing attack that happened on April 30. The hacker used clever tricks and social tactics to gain access to the victim’s wallet. This was one of the fifth-largest crypto hacks ever. For comparison, March only saw $29 million in crypto-related losses. That means April’s figures jumped by over 1100%, a wake-up call for the entire industry. Even if you remove the giant Bitcoin theft, April still saw $34 million in damages, a 21% rise. February: ByBit, One of the Biggest Hack In February, the crypto world saw its biggest loss of the year, around $1.53 billion. The main reason was a huge $1.4 billion hack on Bybit , believed to be carried out by North Korea’s Lazarus Group. It’s known as the largest crypto hack ever. Yet $18M Was Returned Even though many people lost money, about $18.2 million was returned by white-hat hackers. These are ethical hackers who discover vulnerabilities, but instead of stealing funds, they return them and often alert the project teams to fix the issues. Three platforms, such as KiloEx, Loopscale, and zkSync, were lucky enough to get their funds back thanks to such good actors.

44016521,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154402,1746084019,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Google Gemini Unveils Powerful AI Image Editing Tools,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/google-gemini-image-editing/,"In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, advancements like those seen in Google Gemini’s latest update are significant. For those tracking the intersection of technology and digital assets, understanding the capabilities of powerful AI models is key. Google has just announced a major upgrade to its Gemini chatbot, bringing robust native image creation and editing tools directly into the user experience. Google Gemini: Enhanced Visual Capabilities Google’s Gemini chatbot application is stepping up its game. According to a recent blog post from Google, the platform now includes integrated tools that allow users to work with images in new ways. This isn’t just about generating pictures from text prompts anymore; it’s about having the power to modify existing visuals, whether they were created by AI or uploaded from your personal device. The new native image editing functionality within Gemini is rolling out gradually, starting now and expanding to a wider audience across more than 45 languages and most countries in the coming weeks. This follows Google’s earlier piloting of an AI image editing model in its AI Studio platform, which notably drew attention for its ability to remove watermarks – a feature that sparked considerable discussion. AI Image Editing: What Can You Do? With this upgrade, Google Gemini aims to provide a more integrated and potentially more effective approach to AI image editing compared to some standalone generators. Similar to recent enhancements seen in competitors like ChatGPT, Gemini’s new tools enable a multi-step editing process. Google describes this as leading to “richer, more contextual” outcomes, where text prompts and visual modifications work together seamlessly. Here are some of the core image editing capabilities now available: Background Changes: Easily swap out the background of an image. Object Replacement: Substitute specific objects within a photo. Adding Elements: Insert new items or details into an image. Modifying Features: Alter aspects like hair color in a portrait. The idea is that you can upload an image or start with an AI-generated one and then refine it iteratively using conversational prompts within the Gemini interface. Generative AI: Powering Creative Workflows The underlying technology driving these new features is Generative AI. By integrating image generation and editing directly into the chatbot’s workflow, Google is enabling users to move beyond simple text outputs or single-step image creation. The “multi-step” flow allows for a more dynamic interaction where the AI understands context across prompts, combining text instructions with visual feedback. Google provides examples illustrating this integrated approach. Imagine uploading a personal photograph and asking Gemini to generate versions showing you with different hair colors. Another example involves asking Gemini to draft a bedtime story about dragons and simultaneously generate accompanying images for the narrative. This integration of text and visual generation within a single conversational thread represents a significant step forward in making Generative AI tools more versatile and user-friendly for creative tasks. AI Chatbot Evolution: Beyond Text This update marks a key evolution for Gemini as an AI Chatbot. Originally focused primarily on text-based interactions and information retrieval, Gemini is transforming into a multimodal assistant capable of deeply understanding and manipulating visual content alongside text. This makes the chatbot a more powerful tool for content creation, design, and personalized visual tasks. The ability to upload a personal photo and then use the chatbot to explore creative modifications or generate related visuals demonstrates a shift towards Gemini becoming a more interactive creative partner. This goes beyond merely describing images or generating new ones from scratch; it involves direct manipulation of visual data based on conversational input, enhancing the overall utility of the AI Chatbot for a wider range of applications. Image Generation: Navigating Potential Risks While the creative possibilities of enhanced Image Generation and editing are exciting, they also raise important questions, particularly regarding the potential for misuse, such as creating deepfakes. Google acknowledges these concerns. To address potential risks, Google states that images created or edited using Gemini’s native tools will include an invisible watermark. This embedded metadata can help identify that an image was AI-generated or modified by the platform. Currently, there is no visible watermark added to these images, but Google is actively experimenting with the possibility of adding a visible indicator on all images generated by Gemini in the future. This ongoing effort highlights the industry’s challenge in balancing powerful AI capabilities with the need for transparency and preventing malicious use. Benefits and Examples The benefits of these integrated tools are clear for various user groups: Content Creators: Quickly generate and modify visuals for blogs, social media, or presentations. Marketers: Create custom imagery for campaigns or marketing materials. Casual Users: Experiment with personal photos, create unique visuals for stories, or explore creative ideas without needing complex software. The examples provided by Google – changing hair color or generating story illustrations – show the range from simple personal edits to more complex creative projects. Challenges and Considerations The primary challenge remains the ethical implications of realistic image manipulation. While Google is implementing invisible watermarks, the ease with which images can be altered necessitates ongoing discussion and development of robust detection methods and responsible use guidelines. The future inclusion of visible watermarks, if implemented, could be a step towards greater transparency. Summary of the Update Google’s integration of advanced AI Image Editing and Generation tools into its Google Gemini AI Chatbot represents a significant upgrade. This allows users to modify both AI-created and uploaded images directly within the conversational interface using a multi-step process. The rollout is underway globally. While offering powerful new creative capabilities and streamlining workflows, the update also brings attention to the ongoing challenges of ensuring responsible Generative AI use and mitigating risks like deepfakes, which Google is addressing through watermarking efforts. This move positions Gemini as a more versatile and visually capable AI assistant.

The Commerce Department reported Wednesday that the US gross domestic product shrank at an annual rate of 0.3%, a reversal from the 2.4% growth posted in the previous quarter. Speaking at a White House event attended by top business executives, Trump blamed his predecessor, President Joe Biden, for America’s economic slump and said citizens “have to give him a little bit of time to get moving.” The president’s comments did not please Democratic leaders, who argued that Trump, not Biden, must answer for the economic decline. “This is not Joe Biden’s economy, Donald, it is your economy,” said House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. “It is the Trump economy; it is a failed economy, and the American people know it.” According to the White House Archives, former President Joe Biden left office when the national unemployment rate stood at 4.1%, capping off a term that saw the lowest average jobless rate of any presidency since the 1960s. The data also showed that inflation peaked during the post-pandemic supply chain disruptions but dropped to 2.9% at the start of 2024, a level nearing the Federal Reserve’s long-term target. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth expanded at a 3.1% annual rate, outpacing other G7 nations. Congress divided over Trump’s 100-day progress in office During Wednesday’s event, Trump defended his policies with plans for large-scale investments in infrastructure, healthcare, and technology, announcing $8 trillion in new private-sector commitments. He introduced several CEOs, such as Hyundai’s Jose Munoz, Toyota’s Ted Ogawa, and Johnson & Johnson’s Joaquin Duato, promising that the company heads would invest in America and improve the country’s manufacturing output. Yet, in Congress, the Senate narrowly rejected a proposed bill that would have blocked the POTUS from imposing trade tariffs. Congress had cast a 49-49 vote before Vice President JD Vance broke the tie to send away the liberals’ efforts against Trump’s trade policies. Three Republican senators, Rand Paul of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, broke ranks to support the measure, joining all present Democrats and Independents. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon lambasted the White House for being reckless with trade partners, saying Congress could not remain “an idle spectator in the tariff madness.” “ If it’s worse again in the second quarter, people would start asking, ‘Is it good policy, or is it a bad policy? ’” explained Senator Paul, one of the resolution’s co-sponsors. Retailers warn of goods shortages In other related news, import activity at the Port of Los Angeles, one of the nation’s busiest gateways for goods from Asia, has nosedived in recent weeks following the imposition of new tariffs on China. The drop-off is directly tied to steep tariffs now levied on imports from China, where duties on some goods have soared as high as 145%. In response, China has imposed retaliatory tariffs of up to 125% on US exports. According to supply chain firm Flexport, container bookings from China to America are down by as much as 60%. Some production is shifting to locations like Vietnam and Thailand, with bookings from those countries rising between 5% and 10%, but retailers aren’t sure it will be enough to fill the gap left by China. Despite the warnings, Trump is not worried about potential shortages, saying so during a televised appearance with cabinet members yesterday morning. “ Well, maybe the children will have to have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, you know? ” he reckoned. “And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) operates in its fourth pre-sale phase while collecting $7.3 million through the distribution of over 425 million tokens. Investor interest in this project is strong as evidenced by the number of 9,200 holders who have joined to date. The upcoming phase 4 introduces a 20% cost increase up to $0.03 which will deliver significant profitability to investors. Retail investors are attracted to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) because of the strong market interest which competes against Pepe’s increasingly dominant popularity rather than Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) declines. Pepe Outpacing Shiba Inu Pepe continues to distance itself from Shiba Inu (SHIB) in terms of dominance within the meme coin sector. Retail investor affection for SHIB has waned because its community hype shows declining interest. Its price shows no real growth because investors base their decisions on speculation instead of concrete uses. No other meme coin excels like Pepe because it maintains sections of passionate social media fans who create nearly spontaneous price fluctuations. Price spikes for Pepe occur more frequently on sentiment platforms because they are generated by viral marketing events. The outdated narratives used by SHIB emerge inferior to Pepe’s active community engagement methods. Future projections indicate that Pepe coins will eclipse SHIB in the meme coin market to establish command as the top choice in its sector. The financial service provider Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents distinct opportunities to users. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Power Mutuum Finance (MUTM) maintains high investor interest through the fourth phase of its presale. The sales of Mutuum Finance tokens at $0.025 continue to expand at a rapid pace as investors contribute $7.3 million. Market demand has resulted in 9,200 active holders of the project. The upcoming Phase 5 price increase to $0.03 will deliver a profitable 20% return for present investors. The projected $0.06 listing value of MUTM tokens demonstrates an expected 140% profitability. Expert analysts foresee a market movement to $2.50 following launch that will generate a breathtaking 9,900% profit for investors. During a recent announcement the team presented a new dashboard system which reports the top 50 token holders who will receive additional rewards for keeping their positions. The competitive buying generated by this initiative helps increase interest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Security and Scalability Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gives trust a top priority by starting the process of getting its smart contract audited by Certik. When the announcement goes out to social networks it will result in increased investor faith. Network incidents experienced on the Solana blockchain create an advantage for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) through its detailed approach to security. FOMO has driven rapid sales in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) pre-sales phases one and four because buyers wanted to acquire tokens before prices rose further. The number of MUTM tokens sold brings Mutuum Finance (MUTM) toward its goal of reaching $0.06. The demand for tokens is high because investors recognize that phase 5 will introduce increased prices. The sense of haste reveals Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s ascendance in the market. Why Mutuum Shines Bright Pepe stands as a potential success story with MUTM presenting itself as the next alternative to Solana. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides investors with carefully planned stability despite Pepe’s meme-driven market domination. The presale achievements and forecasted 140% launchup exceed the stagnant growth of SHIB. Audited security combined with structured gains from Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offer investors a stronger position than what Solana provides. Potential investors should enter phase 4 before its price increase because it will rise by 20% to $0.03. Those who take risks in the crypto market should consider Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as their ideal investment opportunity.

44016759,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154403,1746084621,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Microsoft AI Faces Critical Capacity Constraints,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/microsoft-ai-capacity-constraints/,"In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, compute power is the foundational bedrock upon which innovation is built. This holds true whether you’re developing cutting-edge large language models or building decentralized applications that leverage AI capabilities. Recent warnings from Microsoft, a major player in providing this essential infrastructure, highlight a significant challenge: the sheer pace of cloud AI demand is beginning to strain available resources. Understanding the Microsoft AI Capacity Challenge During the company’s fiscal 2025 third-quarter earnings call, Microsoft’s EVP and CFO, Amy Hood, delivered a candid assessment of the situation. She indicated that customers utilizing Microsoft’s AI services could face service disruptions as early as June, the end of their fiscal fourth quarter. The core issue? Demand for Microsoft AI services is simply growing faster than the company can bring new data center capacity online. Hood stated, “We had hoped to be in balance by the end of Q4 but we did see some increased demand, as you saw through the quarter. So we are going to be a little short, a little tight as we exit the year.” This direct acknowledgment underscores the intensity of the current surge in AI adoption across various industries. Why is AI Demand Outpacing Data Center Investment? The explosion in generative AI applications and the broader integration of AI into enterprise workflows have created unprecedented demand for high-performance computing resources, particularly GPUs and specialized AI chips housed within massive data centers. While Microsoft has committed significant capital to meet this demand, the infrastructure required is complex and time-consuming to deploy. Despite this surging demand, some reports earlier this year raised questions about Microsoft’s data center strategy. Investment bank TD Cowen noted in February that Microsoft had reportedly cancelled multiple data center leases, equating to a substantial amount of power capacity. Subsequent reports also mentioned additional cancellations. Microsoft maintains that these cancellations are not necessarily related to the current capacity constraints, suggesting they might be part of ongoing portfolio management or shifts in build strategy. Crucially, Microsoft reiterated its commitment to a massive data center investment plan, earmarking $80 billion for infrastructure spending this year alone, with half designated for U.S.-based facilities. This figure demonstrates the company’s long-term view on AI growth and the foundational infrastructure needed. The Long Road of AI Infrastructure Development Building and commissioning large-scale data centers is not a quick process. Amy Hood emphasized the significant lead times involved, stating, “Just a reminder, these are very long lead time decisions, from land to build out, it can be, you know, lead times of five to seven years, two to three years.” This highlights the fundamental challenge in matching unpredictable, rapidly accelerating demand with infrastructure that requires years of planning and construction. The company is constantly engaged in a delicate balancing act, trying to forecast future demand curves years in advance to inform their build decisions. While facing near-term AI capacity constraints , Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella noted during the earnings call that the company had successfully opened data centers across 10 new countries and four new continents in the past quarter alone, illustrating their ongoing global expansion efforts to build out essential AI infrastructure . Potential Impact of AI Capacity Constraints For businesses and developers relying on Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform for their AI workloads, these constraints could translate into longer wait times for accessing powerful compute resources, potential service slowdowns, or difficulty scaling applications as quickly as desired. While Microsoft is working to mitigate these issues through ongoing builds and optimizations, the warning serves as a reminder that even the largest tech companies face physical limitations in keeping pace with the AI revolution. This situation underscores a broader challenge across the tech industry: the physical world of power grids, land acquisition, construction, and supply chains for components like GPUs creates bottlenecks for the seemingly infinite possibilities of digital AI. Navigating the Future of Cloud AI Demand Microsoft’s position is one of aggressive investment coupled with the reality of infrastructure build cycles. They are pouring billions into expanding their global footprint and acquiring the necessary hardware. The near-term tightness is a symptom of success – overwhelming demand – but also a challenge that requires careful management to avoid hindering customer innovation. The commitment to an $80 billion investment signals confidence in the sustained growth of AI. However, the warning about potential constraints indicates that the path to meeting this demand perfectly is complex and subject to the realities of large-scale construction and hardware procurement. As AI continues to evolve and integrate into more aspects of business and life, the race to build the underlying compute infrastructure will remain a critical factor. In conclusion, Microsoft’s acknowledgment of potential AI capacity constraints is a significant signal about the current state of the AI market. It highlights the immense demand, the scale of investment required, and the inherent challenges in rapidly scaling physical infrastructure. While short-term tightness is expected, the long-term strategic focus remains on massive investment to power the future of AI.

But when it comes to staking returns, many investors have started noticing a gap. The average Solana staking yield sits between 6% to 8% — decent, but not life-changing. Now, a new contender is reshaping the staking landscape: Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S). Offering 30% higher returns than Solana’s typical average through its innovative liquid staking system, Bitcoin Solaris is giving investors a rare chance to maximize passive income without sacrificing liquidity or flexibility — a breakthrough that’s attracting massive attention across the crypto community. Solana’s Strengths — And Where It Falls Short Solana brought high-speed blockchain to the masses, solving major scalability issues. Its staking system helped secure the network while rewarding participants. However, its rewards have struggled to keep pace with user expectations: Lower average yields over time due to network inflation control Locked staking, where users cannot freely use staked assets Limited DeFi usage of staked tokens without extra complex protocols For users seeking true flexibility and higher rewards, something better was needed, and Bitcoin Solaris stepped in to provide it. Bitcoin Solaris: Liquid Staking Redefined Bitcoin Solaris introduces a staking system that doesn’t just boost returns — it completely rewrites the rules. Instead of locking tokens for months, Bitcoin Solaris offers liquid staking where users stake BTC-S and receive sBTC-S tokens (1:1 ratio) in return. Here’s what makes it revolutionary: 30% higher yield compared to Solana’s typical staking rewards Immediate liquidity: sBTC-S tokens can be traded, held, or used across DeFi platforms Passive rewards continue to accumulate automatically Governance participation: sBTC-S holders can vote on protocol changes Low energy usage with Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus Could This Be Your Early Chance at the Future of Bitcoin? This liquid staking model makes earning easier, smarter, and more flexible, allowing users to grow their wealth without missing out on market opportunities. Helios: The Engine Behind Bitcoin Solaris DeFi The magic behind Bitcoin Solaris’s seamless DeFi experience is Helios — an advanced system that powers decentralized exchanges (DEXs), lending protocols, yield farming, and more. Thanks to Helios: sBTC-S tokens can be used in low-slippage DEXs Liquidity pools are optimized for fast, gas-efficient transactions Borrowing and lending become simple, transparent, and inexpensive Cross-chain bridges allow users to move assets easily between ecosystems like Solana and Ethereum Unlike traditional staking models where your capital is stuck, Bitcoin Solaris turns staked assets into usable DeFi tools, giving users the ability to earn multiple layers of rewards. Presale Live: Early Entry with Huge Potential Upside Bitcoin Solaris is currently in Presale Phase 1, and early participants are taking advantage before the next price jump: Current Price: $1.00 Next Phase: $2.00 Launch Price: $20.00 Potential ROI: Up to 1,900% Presale Duration: Only 3 months With a fixed 21 million BTC-S supply, similar to Bitcoin’s legendary scarcity model, and audited smart contracts for extra safety , early positioning could unlock massive wealth-building opportunities, especially for those combining mining, staking, and DeFi strategies. Community Growth Through the Double Rewards Referral Program One of the most attractive features that caught many crypto enthusiasts’ attention, like Crypto Roya,l is Bitcoin Solaris incentive-driven referral system to expand its global community: 5% bonus in BTC-S for referrers 5% bonus for referred users Automatic, real-time reward distribution during the presale phase How to participate: Sign up at bitcoinsolaris.com Access your dashboard and copy your unique referral link Share your link on social media, forums, or directly with friends Earn passive rewards while helping build the future of decentralized finance Click Here To Get The Full Scope Of BTC-S Referral Program Conclusion Bitcoin Solaris goes beyond fixing Ethereum’s and Solana’s limitations—it redefines decentralized finance. With 30% higher staking yields, liquid sBTC-S tokens, and smooth DeFi integration through Helios, it’s setting a new standard for crypto earnings. For anyone who missed out on Ethereum or Solana early, this is a second chance. With live technology and an active presale, Bitcoin Solaris offers real passive income potential and possibly life-changing wealth.

The report , published on April 30, alleged that the board had approached recruitment firms due to concerns over Musk’s political activity and split focus across multiple ventures. Musk took to X to denounce the article, stating that the WSJ deliberately published false information while knowingly excluding an “unequivocal denial” from Tesla’s board. Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm also issued a strong rebuttal early Thursday morning, posting on Tesla’s official X account that the board had not contacted recruiters. “This is absolutely false,” she said. “The CEO of Tesla is Elon Musk and the Board is highly confident in his ability to continue executing on the exciting growth plan ahead.” Musk and Tesla board dismissing WSJ report. Source: Elon Musk Related: WSJ debacle fueled US lawmakers’ ill-informed crusade against crypto Musk under scrutiny for role in DOGE The WSJ’s report comes amid growing scrutiny of Musk’s political involvement, particularly his advisory role in US President Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Critics argue that his involvement with the Trump administration has hurt Tesla’s brand, especially in international markets. Tesla’s first-quarter profit plunged 71%, and its market value has declined by over $800 billion since the start of the year. The automaker’s Q1 results released show revenues hit $19.34 billion, missing Wall Street estimates by 7.85% and marking a 9.2% fall from the same period last year. However, the firm held onto its Bitcoin during the first quarter of 2025. Tesla’s digital asset holdings dropped 11.61% in value from $1.076 billion to $951 million in Q1, alongside Bitcoin’s 11.56% price fall to $82,514 over the same time. Musk, who also runs SpaceX, Neuralink, and the recently merged X and xAI, has agreed to shift more of his time back to Tesla in response to shareholder pressure. According to reports, he is now advising DOGE remotely and has scaled back his physical presence in Washington. Related: Elon Musk’s sale of X to xAI just made fraud lawsuit ’a lot spicer’ Crypto executives lash out at WSJ Musk’s backlash against the WSJ adds to a growing chorus of criticism from crypto executives who have recently accused the outlet of misleading coverage and bias against the digital asset industry . On April 12, Binance’s former CEO Changpeng Zhao dismissed a WSJ report that claimed he has agreed to provide evidence against Tron founder Justin Sun as part of a plea deal with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ). “WSJ is really TRYING here. They seem to have forgotten who went to prison and who didn’t,” Zhao wrote in an April 12 X post. “People who become gov witnesses don’t go to prison. They are protected. I heard someone paid WSJ employees to smear me.” Soruce: CZ In March 2023, Tether also rejected a WSJ report alleging it used fake documents and shell companies to maintain banking access, calling the claims “stale,” “inaccurate,” and “misleading.” Magazine: Binance hits back at WSJ, Hong Kong crypto ETF’s take ‘$50B equivalent’: Asia Express",,EN,0,0,ASIA|DOGE|EXCHANGE|MARKET|BNB,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-01 07:37:53

According to the official site , the House passed North Carolina’s Digital Assets Investment Act, or House Bill 92 on its third reading on April 30 with a vote of 71 to 44. The crypto investment bill is now headed towards the Senate for approval or rejection before it can be passed into legislation . HB 92 was first introduced in February this year by Republican House Speaker Destin Hall. The crypto investment bill would allow the state treasure to invest government funds into digital assets that fulfill certain requirements. First, the digital asset must be in the form of an exchange-traded product or ETP. Second, the average market cap for the crypto asset must be at least $750 billion within the span of a year, as determined by the state treasurer using commercially reasonable methods. You might also like: North Carolina introduces bill to allow the use of crypto to pay taxes Additionally, the crypto investment bill stipulates the state treasurer can only invest in digital assets after obtaining an independent third-party assessment confirming that the crypto holdings are maintained under a secure custody solution. The crypto asset should also abide by regulatory compliance standards and risk oversight. Amendments made to the crypto investment bill’s draft have also ensured that the treasurer may be allowed to assess the feasibility of letting members of retirement and deferred compensation plans to elect to invest in digital assets in the form of exchange-traded products. Earlier in April, North Carolina representatives introduced another bill that would allow the use of crypto assets for tax payments as well as other economic transactions. Similar to its predecessor, HB 92, the draft lists down a series of requirements that chosen crypto assets have to fulfill in order to be eligible for tax payments and other economic transactions. So far, Arizona has become the first state to come close to passing crypto draft bills into law. Though, North Carolina seems to be running second in the race. On April 28, Arizona’s House approved two legislation, SB 1025 and SB 1373, which propose different methods for establishing a Strategic Bitcoin ( BTC ) Reserve.

Accordingly, World plans to launch a Visa card that will allow users to pay for goods and services using WLD tokens and other cryptocurrencies. The new card will be available in the US later this year. “World Card will connect directly to an individual’s World App wallet, allowing them to spend their digital assets wherever Visa is accepted. “Traders can seamlessly buy fiat currency without needing to understand crypto, while individuals gain flexibility in how they use their digital assets.” World also recently announced that it has partnered with Match Group, the parent company behind popular dating apps Tinder, Hinge, Match.com, and Plenty of Fish. Accordingly, World said the Match partnership will begin with a pilot program for Tinder users in Japan. World also added that app users will have access to prediction marketplace Kalshi. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: This Altcoin, Among the World's Largest, Is Expanding to the US!

However, a recent study has cast a shadow over the integrity of one of the most popular platforms, Chatbot Arena, run by LM Arena. The findings, detailed in a new paper from researchers at Cohere, Stanford, MIT, and Ai2, suggest that LM Arena may have provided preferential treatment to certain top AI labs , potentially allowing them to manipulate their rankings on the leaderboard. Allegations Against LM Arena and Chatbot Arena The core accusation leveled by the study authors is that LM Arena , the organization behind the widely used Chatbot Arena benchmark, did not maintain a level playing field for all participants. Specifically, the paper highlights several practices that allegedly favored a select group of industry-leading AI companies, including Meta, OpenAI, Google, and Amazon. These practices, according to the researchers, amount to ‘gamification’ of the benchmark process. Key allegations from the study include: Private Testing Access: Certain companies were reportedly allowed to test multiple variants of their AI models privately on the platform before public release. Selective Score Publication: After private testing, these favored labs allegedly did not have to publish the scores of their lower-performing model variants, only revealing the results of the best performers. Unequal Battle Frequency: The study found evidence suggesting that models from certain companies appeared in a higher number of Chatbot Arena ‘battles’ (side-by-side comparisons voted on by users), giving them more data and potentially an unfair advantage in improving their models or scores. Sara Hooker, VP of AI research at Cohere and a co-author of the study, stated that only a handful of companies were aware of or received significant amounts of this private testing opportunity, calling it a form of ‘gamification’. LM Arena’s Response to the Accusations LM Arena, which originated as an academic project from UC Berkeley, has long presented Chatbot Arena as an impartial and community-driven evaluation platform. In response to the study’s claims, LM Arena co-founder Ion Stoica called the paper full of ‘inaccuracies’ and ‘questionable analysis’. In statements and posts on X, LM Arena defended its commitment to fair evaluations and invited all model providers to submit more models for testing. They argued that one provider submitting more tests than another does not inherently constitute unfair treatment. LM Arena also contested the study’s methodology and conclusions regarding battle frequency for models from non-major labs and the correlation between Chatbot Arena performance and other benchmarks like Arena Hard. A principal researcher at Google DeepMind also disputed specific numbers in the study, claiming Google had only submitted one model for pre-release testing, not the number implied by the paper. Study Limitations and Context The study authors acknowledged one significant limitation: their reliance on ‘self-identification’ by prompting AI models about their origin to classify them during private testing. While this method is not entirely foolproof, the authors noted that LM Arena did not dispute their preliminary findings when shared. This controversy comes shortly after Meta faced criticism for optimizing a Llama 4 model specifically for ‘conversationality’ to perform well on Chatbot Arena, only to not release that optimized version, while the standard release performed worse on the benchmark. At that time, LM Arena had stated Meta should have been more transparent. The current study adds another layer of scrutiny to the transparency and fairness of the AI benchmark landscape, especially as LM Arena recently announced plans to launch as a company and raise capital. Recommendations for a Fairer Benchmark The study proposes several changes to improve the fairness of Chatbot Arena: Establishing clear and transparent limits on private testing. Publicly disclosing scores from private pre-release tests. Adjusting the sampling algorithm to ensure all models appear in a similar number of battles. LM Arena has pushed back on some suggestions, particularly the idea of publishing scores for non-public pre-release models, arguing it ‘makes no sense’ as the community cannot test them. However, LM Arena has indicated receptiveness to creating a new sampling algorithm to address concerns about battle frequency. Conclusion: Trust and Transparency in AI Benchmarking The accusations against LM Arena raise important questions about trust and transparency in the critical area of AI benchmark testing. As AI continues to advance and become more integrated into various aspects of technology, the methods used to evaluate AI models must be perceived as fair and impartial by all participants. The study highlights the challenges organizations face in maintaining neutrality when dealing with powerful AI labs and underscores the need for clear, publicly available policies regarding testing, data collection, and score reporting to ensure benchmarks like Chatbot Arena remain reliable indicators of AI performance.

Cassie Craddock, Ripple’s Managing Director for the UK and Europe, says the new proposals reflect the country’s “huge potential” to become a global leader in crypto — especially with its “second-mover advantage.” Ripple Backs the UK’s Regulatory Direction Craddock expressed strong support for the UK’s approach to crypto oversight , calling the draft legislation both “flexible” and “globally competitive.” She noted that Ripple already operates one of its largest international offices in London, underlining the company’s confidence in the region’s long-term potential. Craddock added that while countries like the US, Singapore, and the EU have made earlier regulatory moves, the UK could catch up — and even surpass them — if it delivers the right framework for innovation. “There’s a huge opportunity for the UK here,” Craddock said. “If done right, the country can become a globally competitive crypto market.” Ripple XRP News Highlights Industry Split While Ripple remains optimistic, others in the crypto industry are sounding the alarm. Critics argue that the UK’s regulatory direction, while promising, still lacks clarity. Coinbase UK’s Head, Keith Grose in an interview with CNBC , warned that without solid, supportive rules, the UK risks losing its edge — and potentially its startups — to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions. “The UK has the potential,” Grose noted, “but there’s a real risk of driving innovation elsewhere if the government doesn’t move quickly.” .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Circle Rejected Ripple’s Bold $5 Billion Acquisition Bid? , Stablecoin Rules Still in Limbo One of the biggest hurdles? Stablecoins. Mark Fairless of ClearBank told CNBC that although the bank is eager to launch its own stablecoin, they’re unable to proceed due to vague and incomplete guidance. Industry leaders believe meaningful progress might be stalled until the Bank of England releases a clear framework — which could take years. Crypto Startups Still Face Banking Trouble Another major challenge is access to banking. A survey showed that half of UK crypto firms were denied or lost bank accounts. Keith Grose says this makes it tough for businesses to grow. Without proper banking support, he warns, the UK could lose out on becoming a real crypto hub. Overall, Ripple stays hopeful, but the message is clear: smart, clear rules are key if the UK wants to lead in crypto. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Many feel the regulations are still vague and may drive companies to more supportive regions like the US or Singapore. What’s holding back stablecoin innovation in the UK? Unclear regulatory guidance is preventing companies like ClearBank from launching stablecoins. Are UK crypto startups struggling with banking access? Yes, over half of them have faced account closures or rejections from traditional banks. Could the UK still become a global crypto hub?

According to SoSoValue data , the 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $56.23 million in outflows on April 30, breaking an 8-day streak that had brought in nearly $4 billion. Most of the pullback came from Fidelity’s FBTC and ARK & 21Shares’ ARKB, which lost $137.49 million and $130.79 million, respectively. Grayscale’s GBTC and Bitwise’s BITB also lost $31.96 million and $23.02 million. On the flip side, BlackRock’s IBIT, the biggest BTC ETF by net assets, managed to pull in $267.02 million, helping offset some of the overall losses. The other Bitcoin ETFs didn’t see any flows that day. Total trading volume across these funds hit $2.39 billion, with total net inflows since launch standing at $39.14 billion. Investors turned cautious after Bitcoin failed to hold above $95,000 especially following some disappointing U.S. economic numbers . First, the ADP jobs report showed only 62,000 private sector jobs added in April, way below the 108,000 expected and the weakest since July 2024. You might also like: Trump blames Biden as markets weaken on GDP and tariff turmoil Then, the first estimate for Q1 GDP came in at negative 0.3%, missing forecasts of +0.2%. A big reason for the GDP dip was a 41% jump in imports, as businesses rushed to stock up ahead of President Trump’s fresh wave of tariffs. At present, Trump’s tariff plans are causing jitters across markets . His administration has been pushing for new tariffs on Chinese goods and select European products, aiming to boost U.S. manufacturing but also raising the risk of higher costs and supply chain disruptions. Many companies are racing to import goods before these tariffs fully kick in, adding extra pressure to economic data and contributing to the recent jump in imports. These tariff concerns are feeding into broader fears of stagflation, a mix of weak growth and stubborn inflation, making investors unsure about when or how much the Fed might cut rates. As a result, riskier assets like tech stocks got hit hard on April 30, with the Nasdaq dropping 2% and the S&P 500 sliding 1.5%. Bitcoin ( BTC ) also fell 2% to $93,438 before recovering some ground today.

In April, the crypto sector lost a staggering $364 million to exploits, scams, and hacks, a 1,163% surge from the $28.8 million recorded in March, according to an April 30 X post from blockchain security firm CertiK. The surge was largely driven by a single attack targeting an elderly American, who lost 3,520 Bitcoin worth $330.7 million. As previously reported by crypto.news, the attacker reportedly used advanced social engineering tactics to gain access to the victim’s wallet, making it the fifth-largest crypto theft on record. Excluding that incident, April’s losses totalled $34 million, still representing a 21% rise from the previous month. CertiK identified phishing, access control exploits, social engineering, and price manipulation as the primary attack vectors. Some of the losses were mitigated due to successful recovery efforts by affected protocols and white hat hackers. Roughly $18.2 million in stolen funds were recovered over the course of April, according to CertiK. This included full repayments to KiloEx, which had suffered a $7.5 million exploit but saw the funds returned just four days later.

According to ZKsync, the attacker agreed to return all funds in exchange for a 10% bounty. Similarly, DeFi protocol Loopscale managed to reclaim all of the assets stolen in an attack that exploited vulnerabilities in its token pricing functions. The platform recovered $5.8 million after negotiating directly with the attacker, who agreed to return the funds in exchange for a 10% whitehat bounty and immunity from legal action. Although April saw a sharp rise in losses, February remains the costliest month of the year so far. As crypto.news reported earlier, February saw crypto losses soar to $1.53 billion, driven almost entirely by two major incidents. The $1.46 billion exploit on crypto exchange Bybit accounted for the majority of losses, while stablecoin issuer Infini lost $49.5 million in a separate attack.

Introducing Amazon AI’s Most Capable Offering: Nova Premier Amazon recently unveiled Nova Premier, positioning it as the most capable model within its Nova family of artificial intelligence models. This release is a key part of Amazon’s expanding portfolio, designed to tackle complex tasks that demand a deep understanding of context, sophisticated multi-step planning, and precise execution across diverse data sources and tools. Key features of the Nova Premier AI Model include: Multi-modal Processing: It can process text, images, and videos, offering a versatile approach to data interpretation. (Note: Audio processing is not supported by this specific model). Large Context Window: With a context length of 1 million tokens, Nova Premier can analyze a substantial amount of information simultaneously, equivalent to approximately 750,000 words. Designed for Complexity: Engineered to excel in tasks requiring intricate understanding and execution. Accessing Nova Premier via Amazon Bedrock The new Nova Premier model is made available through Amazon Bedrock , the company’s comprehensive platform for building and scaling generative AI applications. Bedrock provides a foundation for developers to access a variety of leading AI models, including now Nova Premier, simplifying the process of integrating advanced AI capabilities into their projects. Pricing for Nova Premier in Bedrock is structured as follows: $2.50 per 1 million tokens for input (fed into the model). $12.50 per 1 million tokens for output (generated by the model). This pricing is competitive with other flagship models available on similar platforms, such as Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro. Benchmarking the New AI Model: Strengths and Weaknesses While Amazon positions Nova Premier as highly capable, its performance on various benchmarks presents a mixed picture when compared to some rival flagship models. According to Amazon’s internal testing: Strengths: Nova Premier performs well on tests related to knowledge retrieval (SimpleQA) and visual understanding (MMMU). Weaknesses: It trails behind models like Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro on coding tests (SWE-Bench Verified) and shows weaker performance on benchmarks measuring math and science knowledge (GPQA Diamond and AIME 2025). It’s also important to note that Premier is not designed as a ‘reasoning’ model in the same vein as some others, meaning it doesn’t allocate extra time and computing resources for extensive fact-checking or deliberation on answers. Strategic Focus: Generative AI and Model Distillation Amazon is particularly highlighting Nova Premier’s potential for ‘distillation’. This process involves using a larger, more capable model like Premier to ‘teach’ or transfer its capabilities for a specific task into a smaller, more efficient model. This can result in faster and more cost-effective AI solutions tailored for particular use cases. This strategic focus underscores Amazon’s deep commitment to the broader field of Generative AI . CEO Andy Jassy has emphasized the company’s extensive investment in AI, revealing that Amazon is developing over 1,000 generative AI applications. He also stated that Amazon’s AI revenue is experiencing triple-digit year-over-year growth and represents a multi-billion-dollar annual revenue run rate, signaling that Amazon AI is a central pillar of the company’s future growth strategy. Conclusion: A Key Step in Amazon’s AI Ambitions The launch of Nova Premier represents a significant step for Amazon in expanding its AI capabilities and strengthening its offering within Amazon Bedrock . While it may not outperform rivals on every single benchmark, its multi-modal processing, large context window, and strategic positioning for tasks like model distillation make it a valuable addition to the AI landscape. As Amazon continues to heavily invest in and develop its Generative AI portfolio, Nova Premier is poised to play a crucial role in enabling developers to build more sophisticated and efficient AI applications.

The boost in confidence follows recent leadership changes at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which oversees crypto regulation . An XRP ETF would allow institutional investors to gain exposure to XRP through traditional markets, potentially opening the floodgates to billions in capital. Bitcoin ETFs, launched earlier in 2024, have already seen nearly $39 billion in net inflows. If XRP ETFs attract even a modest 15% to 30% of that volume, it could send XRP into a major rally. For instance, a 15% share of Bitcoin ETF inflows would bring in about $5.85 billion, which could push XRP’s price to $12.23, representing a 450% gain from its current level of $2.22. If XRP ETFs pull in 30%, XRP could skyrocket to $22.20, a staggering 900% surge. When Will XRP ETF Be Approved? Momentum is building. Prediction platform Polymarket now places the odds of an XRP ETF approval at 80%, up sharply from 68% last week. Major asset managers—Bitwise, WisdomTree, and Franklin Templeton—have all filed proposals. While the SEC has delayed its decision on Franklin Templeton’s XRP ETF to June 17, industry insiders believe that approval is becoming increasingly likely. Should that happen, XRP may follow in Bitcoin’s footsteps and witness a parabolic price explosion. When will the XRP Price go up? Market sentiment is turning increasingly bullish. We can expect XRP to reclaim its April peak of $2.36 in the short term, with fresh all-time highs likely in 2025. Popular trader Dark Defender sees the recent dip as part of a broader bullish pattern, while Allincrypto projects XRP could hit $19.27 in the longer run. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Is Made in America, Here’s Why That Matters , XRP Price Today: Key Levels to Watch Despite the bullish ETF narrative, XRP price has dipped 5%, weighed down by weaker U.S. economic data. The altcoin is currently forming a bullish technical setup, and a breakout above $2.40 could send it straight to $3.74. For this upside to materialize, XRP must hold its ground above the critical $2.20 support and overcome resistance at $2.80–$3.00. If it does, the altcoin could enter a fresh rally phase. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The move also requires Nasdaq’s clearance before trading can commence under the planned ticker symbol, GLXY, according to a recent announcement . Galaxy CEO Calls Nasdaq Move a “Milestone” for Expanding Access to Crypto and AI Galaxy CEO and founder Mike Novogratz described the step as a “milestone” in a statement on April 30, emphasizing that it will strengthen Galaxy’s role in bridging investor access to the digital asset and artificial intelligence sectors. The dual-market presence would broaden the firm’s visibility and attract a wider pool of institutional investors. Galaxy has traded on the TSX since July 2020 but is down roughly 12.28% year-to-date, according to Google Finance data, reflecting broader market headwinds. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq 100 has fallen 7.33% in 2025, though April brought a slight rebound, helping to boost sentiment among tech and crypto investors. Galaxy’s U.S. listing ambitions coincide with renewed optimism in Nasdaq-listed crypto firms. Coinbase (COIN) rose 17.80% in April, while MicroStrategy (MSTR), led by Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor, gained 31.86%. Bitcoin mining company CleanSpark (CLSK) also surged by 21.58%, according to Google Finance data. Novogratz, a well-known Bitcoin proponent, remains committed to growing Galaxy’s investment footprint. The firm’s Galaxy Ventures Fund I LP is reportedly targeting up to $180 million in capital by June, aiming to support about 30 startups in the crypto and blockchain space. Prominent crypto entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano noted the market’s resilience in an April 30 post on X, highlighting that the Nasdaq 100 finished April up more than 1%. “And people are still talking about the Great Depression,” he quipped, calling the market’s reaction “insane.” The Nasdaq 100 ended April up more than 1% and people are still talking about the Great Depression. Insane. — Anthony Pompliano (@APompliano) May 1, 2025 If Galaxy secures the necessary approvals, it will soon join the ranks of major crypto firms anchoring their future to U.S. capital markets, underscoring a growing convergence between traditional finance and digital assets. Galaxy Digital UK Arm Secures FCA License Last month, Galaxy Digital secured a regulatory license for its UK subsidiary on Wednesday. The license from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) would allow Galaxy to offer derivatives trading capabilities in the UK. Further, the license will help the firm’s investment banking unit to offer capital-raising and advisory services from its London office. Galaxy Digital UK would also support its asset management business with activities like fund distribution. In March, the Office of the Attorney General of the State of New York (OAG) fined Galaxy Digital $200 million following an investigation into its alleged market manipulation of the cryptocurrency Luna. The investigation, conducted under the Martin Act and New York Executive Law Section 63(12), found that Galaxy engaged in deceptive trading practices by promoting Luna while secretly offloading its holdings. Galaxy Digital allegedly began acquiring Luna in 2020 directly from Terraform Labs at a significant discount, with the understanding that it would use its influence to drive interest in the token.

The post argues that the components commonly perceived as separate, such as XRP, XLM, Starlink, and Grok, are interlinked parts of a premeditated infrastructure shift leading to a globally unified digital system. The tweet begins by dismissing the “X” brand as a superficial rebranding decision. Instead, it claims “X” is the marker for a coordinated global transformation. Stellar Rippler states that those who view XRP, XLM, Grok (xAI), and Starlink as unrelated entities are mistaken, and that these technologies are intentionally converging under Musk’s vision for a future shaped by digital control and connectivity. A Unified System of Identity, Payments, and Access According to the tweet, Musk is consolidating influence over four key domains. First is identity through verified user systems on the X platform. Second is communication, which the commentator attributes to X’s overarching role as a communication hub. Third is finance, through the development of XPay, which is said to integrate monetary transactions. Finally, the fourth component is access, through the expanding coverage of Starlink’s satellite internet network. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The post emphasizes that XRP and XLM are ISO 20022-compliant , enabling them to serve as interoperable currency settlement layers across different financial systems. XRP is identified as the preferred infrastructure for institutional banking transactions, while XLM is associated with retail-level financial activity. Meanwhile, Starlink’s satellite network provides internet access and is a foundational component for global payment networks. Internet as the Foundation for Crypto Settlement Stellar Rippler claims that Starlink is essential to blockchain functionality, stating that “no internet = no crypto.” Starlink’s capacity to deliver internet in remote or underdeveloped areas, including regions without traditional financial infrastructure, is presented as key to enabling peer-to-peer payments using digital assets like XRP and XLM—even in offline conditions. The tweet references Ripple Labs’ ongoing work on offline payment capabilities via the XRP Ledger, suggesting this aligns with Starlink’s functionality. From PayPal to X: A Long-Term Strategy for Global Control The tweet connects the rise of Ripple and other fintech innovations to the early work of the PayPal Mafia, particularly Musk, Peter Thiel, and Max Levchin. According to the post, Ripple was once framed as a “PayPal 2.0.” Now, the development of the X ecosystem, coupled with AI identity verification from xAI’s Grok, represents what the commentator calls Phase 3 of a long-term plan. Stellar Rippler frames the trajectory as deliberate and multi-phased: beginning with PayPal as an early digital payment system, progressing through Ripple’s development of cross-border remittance solutions , and culminating now in a fusion of orbital internet, digital assets, artificial intelligence, and programmable finance under the “X” brand. The final part of the post argues that this infrastructure will facilitate a system of global programmable liquidity. The commentator contends that this system will operate largely outside of legacy financial institutions and be coordinated through Starlink’s orbital network, AI tools such as Grok for identity verification, and settlement layers built on XRP and XLM. Summing up the message, Stellar Rippler writes that “X will become the layer you live on,” suggesting that the world is gradually shifting into a digitally governed ecosystem that will be omnipresent and infrastructure-independent.

44017525,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154406,1746086446,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Staggering Meta AI Revenue: $1.4 Trillion Forecast Revealed,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/meta-ai-revenue-forecast/,"The world of technology and finance is often full of surprises, but few compare to the scale of the numbers recently revealed regarding Meta’s ambitions in the artificial intelligence space. Unsealed court documents have lifted the curtain on the tech giant’s internal projections, showing a truly staggering potential for Meta AI revenue from its generative AI products. Understanding the Generative AI Revenue Forecast According to court documents made public on Wednesday, Meta made internal predictions last year forecasting significant revenue from its generative AI initiatives. For the year 2025, the company anticipated bringing in between $2 billion and $3 billion. Looking further ahead, the projections become exponentially larger, with a forecast ranging from a substantial $460 billion to an astonishing $1.4 trillion by the year 2035. These documents were submitted by legal counsel representing book authors who are suing Meta, alleging the company used their copyrighted works without authorization to train its AI models. It’s important to note that the documents do not provide a precise definition of what Meta specifically categorizes as a “generative AI product” when making these forecasts. However, based on public information, Meta is actively developing and deploying generative AI across several areas that could contribute to this projected revenue. How Meta Plans to Generate Trillions While the exact breakdown leading to a potential $1.4 trillion in generative AI revenue by 2035 isn’t detailed in the unsealed documents, Meta has several public-facing initiatives that point towards potential revenue streams. These include: Llama Model Ecosystem: Meta has released its Llama collection of models as open source, fostering a large ecosystem. The company has revenue-sharing agreements in place with certain partners who host or utilize these models commercially. API Access: A recently launched API allows businesses and developers to customize and evaluate Llama models, potentially opening up significant B2B revenue streams through usage fees or premium features. Meta AI Assistant: CEO Mark Zuckerberg mentioned during the company’s Q1 earnings call that Meta AI, the company’s AI assistant, could eventually incorporate advertising and potentially offer a subscription tier with additional features. This positions the AI assistant as a direct consumer-facing revenue channel. These diverse approaches demonstrate Meta’s strategy to monetize its AI investments across different parts of the market, from developers and businesses to end consumers. Massive AI Spending Powers the Meta Forecast Achieving such ambitious revenue targets requires significant investment, and the court documents also shed light on Meta’s substantial AI spending . According to the filings, Meta’s budget specifically for its “GenAI” product groups exceeded $900 million in 2024 and is projected to surpass $1 billion in the current year. This figure represents the direct budget for the AI product teams themselves. Beyond the product group budgets, the infrastructure required to train and run large AI models like the Llama models adds billions more to Meta’s expenditures. The company has previously announced plans to spend between $60 billion and $80 billion on capital expenditures in 2025, primarily focused on building expansive new data centers essential for its AI operations. The Cost of Data and the Lawsuit Context The court documents also touch upon the significant costs associated with acquiring training data for AI models. Meta reportedly discussed spending upwards of $200 million in 2023 to acquire data for Llama, with approximately $100 million specifically allocated for licensing books. However, the lawsuit alleges that Meta ultimately chose not to pursue these licensing deals on a large scale and instead opted for pirating ebooks, which is the core of the authors’ legal challenge. These details highlight the complex and costly nature of AI development, including the legal and ethical considerations surrounding training data. Meta has not yet publicly commented on the specifics revealed in these unsealed documents. Conclusion: A Glimpse into AI’s Trillion-Dollar Future The unsealed court documents offer a rare look into the internal financial expectations of one of the world’s largest tech companies regarding generative AI. The forecast of potentially reaching $1.4 trillion in Meta AI revenue by 2035 underscores the immense economic potential Meta sees in this technology. However, this potential is coupled with massive investment requirements and significant legal challenges, particularly concerning the acquisition of training data. As generative AI continues to evolve, the path to these trillion-dollar revenues will likely involve navigating complex technical, financial, and legal landscapes.

Binance announced on Apr. 24 that it would remove ALPACA and three other tokens from its platform following a routine evaluation. The exchange cited factors such as low trading volume and developer inactivity. ALPACA spot trading pairs will be disabled on May 2, while deposits and withdrawals were phased out in the days after the announcement. Normally, tokens drop in value after delisting news, but ALPACA did the opposite. After briefly declining in response to the news, ALPACA surged by as much as 2,300% in just a few days, jumping from $0.029 to a peak of $1.47, a 60x increase on some trading pairs. ALPACA is now trading at $0.53, down 40% in 24 hours but still up 1,100% over the past week, as per CoinGecko data . The rally appears to have been driven by a short squeeze. After the delisting news, many traders opened short positions expecting the price to collapse. However, they were forced to buy back the token to cover losses when ALPACA unexpectedly surged, which caused the price to rise even further. You might also like: Bitget to take legal action against eight accounts for $20M VOXEL token manipulation The squeeze was further tightened when Binance modified its funding rates. The funding cap was increased from ±2% to ±4%, and settlement intervals were reduced from four hours to one hour, which resulted in higher costs for short sellers. This made holding bearish positions expensive and risky. Meanwhile, ALPACA’s supply tightened. A supply shock was caused by the team’s suspension of new token issuance and the burning of about 35 million tokens, or 18.6% of the maximum supply. Some on-chain observers suspect market manipulation . Positions totaling more than $50 million, including $43 million from short sellers, were liquidated. It’s possible that coordinated whale activity contributed to price increases which caught leveraged traders off guard. The situation was likened to the Gamestop short squeeze of 2021, in which institutional short sellers were outbid by retail traders. However, there are still concerns about how long the ALPACA pump can last and what will happen after Binance’s final delisting.

World, the company behind the distinctive eyeball-scanning Orb devices, is making significant moves to integrate its technology into everyday services. Recently, World announced a series of pivotal World Partnerships designed to boost sign-ups and showcase practical uses for its unique biometric verification system. This isn’t just about proving you’re human; it’s about creating seamless access and utility in the digital world. Expanding Reach Through World Partnerships World is strategically teaming up with major players across different sectors. One notable collaboration is with Match Group, the parent company of popular dating app Tinder. This partnership aims to bring World’s ID verification capabilities to Tinder users in Japan, enhancing trust and security on the platform. Imagine a dating app where verifying your unique human identity is a standard feature. Beyond dating, World is also integrating its verification for easier sign-ins. Collaborations with platforms like Kalshi, an events prediction market, and Morpho, a decentralized lending protocol, mean users can potentially access these services using their World-registered Biometric ID . This move simplifies user onboarding and login processes, leveraging the uniqueness of biometric verification. Introducing the Crypto Visa Card Perhaps the most anticipated announcement is the planned launch of The World Card, in partnership with Visa. This development is particularly exciting for the cryptocurrency community. Expected to become available in the U.S. later this year, The World Card will link directly to World’s World App, enabling users to spend digital assets at any location that accepts Visa. Here’s what makes The World Card interesting: It connects to the World App. Allows spending of cryptocurrencies anywhere Visa is accepted. Features automatic exchange of crypto to fiat when needed for transactions. May offer rewards, potentially for specific AI subscriptions and services. This initiative directly addresses a key challenge for crypto users: bridging the gap between digital assets and traditional commerce. A dedicated Crypto Visa Card makes spending digital wealth as easy as using a regular debit or credit card, removing friction from everyday transactions. The Journey of World Coin and Digital Identity Since its founding in 2019 by Tools for Humanity, World has attracted substantial venture capital funding and has onboarded millions of users globally. However, achieving mainstream adoption has presented challenges, partly due to the unique and sometimes perceived as cumbersome method of verifying identity via Orb scans. The concept of a global, verifiable Digital Identity based on biometrics is ambitious and complex. These new partnerships signal World’s strategic pivot towards broader accessibility and practical applications. By integrating with platforms like Tinder, Kalshi, Morpho, and especially Visa, World is targeting audiences who might not have initially sought out biometric verification but could find value in the services it enables. The utility provided by The World Card could be a significant driver for new users to engage with the World ecosystem and obtain their World Coin -based identity. The goal is clear: move beyond just signing up users to demonstrating tangible benefits of having a World ID in diverse real-world and digital scenarios. Making it easier to spend crypto, verify identity on social platforms, or access financial services are concrete steps toward integrating World’s technology into daily life. What These Partnerships Mean for Adoption The success of these collaborations will be crucial for World’s growth trajectory. Partnering with a globally recognized brand like Visa instantly lends credibility and provides a massive potential user base for The World Card. Similarly, integrating with a widely used app like Tinder, even initially in one market like Japan, exposes the technology to millions and normalizes the concept of biometric verification for online interactions. These integrations represent World’s effort to overcome previous adoption hurdles by embedding its service within existing, popular platforms rather than requiring users to adopt a new ecosystem from scratch just for identity verification. Providing a tangible financial tool like a Crypto Visa Card powered by their identity layer adds significant value proposition for potential users. Conclusion: A Step Towards Mainstream Digital Identity World’s recent announcements mark a pivotal moment in its development. By forging strategic World Partnerships with giants like Visa and Match Group, and integrating with platforms like Kalshi and Morpho, World is actively working to make its Biometric ID technology more accessible and useful. The forthcoming Crypto Visa Card is a particularly strong incentive, promising to bridge the gap between World Coin and everyday spending. These efforts demonstrate a clear path towards potentially achieving broader adoption for its unique approach to Digital Identity , proving that proving humanness can unlock real-world utility.

44017804,https://timestabloid.com/?p=65690,1746087095,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Why Ripple Offered $5 Billion to Acquire Stablecoin Issuer Circle,https://timestabloid.com/why-ripple-offered-5-billion-to-acquire-stablecoin-issuer-circle/,"Ripple reportedly offered $4–5 billion to acquire Circle, the issuer of the second-largest U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, USDC, in a bold strategic move that could redefine the global financial landscape. While the deal has not materialized—at least not publicly—the mere existence of such a proposal reveals Ripple’s ambitions are far greater than launching another stablecoin. This isn’t about market competition. It’s about consolidation, infrastructure control, and becoming the backbone of the next-generation financial system. This perspective was brought to public attention by crypto analyst and macro strategist Stellar Rippler, whose deep-dive thread on X outlines how this rumored acquisition attempt fits into a broader geopolitical and technological power play. According to Stellar Rippler, the timeline of events suggests that Ripple’s offer was anything but arbitrary. It was a calculated maneuver with implications stretching far beyond stablecoin dominance. (1/ ) Why would Ripple, which is launching its own stablecoin ($RLUSD), try to acquire a direct competitor? Because it’s not about competition — it’s about consolidation. Let’s break down what no one’s saying: pic.twitter.com/vSmEsdPB8A — Stellar Rippler (@StellarNews007) April 30, 2025 From RLUSD to USDC: A Strategic Timeline Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, was officially announced in May 2024. Designed to run natively on both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum, RLUSD was Ripple’s attempt to enter the highly saturated stablecoin market. However, entering the arena as a newcomer poses significant challenges. Market leaders like Tether (USDT) and Circle’s USDC already dominate liquidity pools, trading pairs, and user adoption across centralized and decentralized platforms. While Ripple geared up for RLUSD’s rollout, Circle was strengthening its foothold. USDC expanded to more blockchain networks, deepened relationships with U.S. financial partners like Visa and Stripe, and positioned itself as the leading “compliant” stablecoin within U.S. regulatory frameworks. By late 2024, whispers emerged about tensions regarding Circle’s valuation and internal governance, coinciding with what appears to have been Ripple’s $5 billion acquisition overture. The timing was anything but coincidental. With RLUSD still in its infancy and USDC leading in institutional trust and regulatory favor, Ripple likely recognized an opportunity to skip the steep uphill climb of organic stablecoin adoption. Acquiring Circle would mean instant access to a fully mature liquidity network, trusted reserve infrastructure, and an embedded position in the evolving regulated crypto-financial ecosystem. A Play for Infrastructure, Not Competition On paper, Ripple and Circle might appear to be competitors. But in practice , they serve complementary functions that, if combined, could transform Ripple into something far more powerful: a consolidated, end-to-end financial stack provider. While Ripple already powers cross-border payments and CBDC solutions for governments and financial institutions via the XRP Ledger and its CBDC platform, it lacks a dominant retail stablecoin with widespread integration across consumer-facing platforms. USDC fills that gap. USDC is one of the most widely adopted stablecoins and the most institutionally favored. It’s fully backed by U.S. Treasuries, integrated into platforms like Robinhood and Visa, and often cited in U.S. policy discussions as the gold standard for compliant digital dollars. By acquiring Circle, Ripple wouldn’t just gain a stablecoin—it would inherit a ready-made network of payment rails, regulatory goodwill, and real-world utility. Such a move would instantly position Ripple as the default settlement layer for both retail-facing stablecoins and wholesale CBDCs, blurring the lines between what are currently separate financial silos. In essence, Ripple wouldn’t just be competing with traditional banks and payment processors—it would be building a parallel financial system. Reimagining the Role of RLUSD A critical question raised by this scenario is the future role of RLUSD . If Ripple owns USDC, does RLUSD become obsolete? Not necessarily. The two could coexist as part of a tiered financial architecture. USDC, with its broad consumer base and merchant integrations, would remain the retail-facing stablecoin. RLUSD, on the other hand, could evolve into a wholesale rail designed for institutional liquidity corridors, government-to-bank CBDC pipelines, and enterprise-level settlements. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This dual-stablecoin model would offer Ripple remarkable flexibility. By housing a trusted retail stablecoin and an optimized wholesale token under one umbrella, Ripple could streamline everything from microtransactions to central bank settlements—all without relying on third-party infrastructure. Regulatory Alignment and the Shadow of Tether The stablecoin landscape is increasingly shaped by regulatory scrutiny. Tether (USDT), while still the market leader in volume, faces ongoing questions about transparency and compliance. USDC, by contrast, is emerging as the regulatory favorite—a position that would be immensely valuable to Ripple, whose strategy has long hinged on legal clarity and institutional trust. Owning USDC would position Ripple as the U.S. government’s most viable private-sector partner for regulated digital value. In an environment where regulatory compliance determines survival, that alignment isn’t just useful—it’s existential. A Signal to the Market—and a Vision for the Future While the Ripple–Circle deal may ultimately remain unrealized, the fact that Ripple was reportedly willing to spend over $5 billion speaks volumes. It signals a vision that goes far beyond stablecoin competition. Ripple isn’t trying to win a share of the market—it’s trying to become the market. Through strategic acquisitions, network expansion, and regulatory alignment, Ripple is constructing a global financial infrastructure stack capable of absorbing the current system and upgrading it for a tokenized, interoperable future. This approach echoes the core message from Stellar Rippler’s analysis: Ripple’s stablecoin ambitions are not about challenging Circle—they’re about integrating it. Ripple’s potential integration of stablecoin infrastructure with XRP-powered systems could redefine its position beyond fintech. It would be a sovereign-grade financial network operating parallel to legacy systems—and potentially replacing them. The Ripple–Circle story may not be over. But even in its rumored form, it has shifted the conversation from competition to consolidation, products to infrastructure, and speculation to system-building. And that may be the most important signal of all. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.
