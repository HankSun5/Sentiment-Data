Not a few dollars, but potentially hundreds of millions. That’s the reality for James Howells, an IT professional from Wales, who accidentally discarded a hard drive containing thousands of Bitcoin years ago. His decade-long mission to recover this treasure from a landfill has become the stuff of legend in the crypto world, and now, this incredible saga is set to reach a global audience. Entertainment startup Lebul has officially acquired the rights to develop content based on Howells’ extraordinary story. This isn’t just a simple news report; Lebul plans a comprehensive project encompassing a docuseries, a podcast, and engaging social-first content. The goal is to dive deep into every aspect of this modern-day treasure hunt, blending the high-stakes world of blockchain technology with the very grounded, complex issues of environmental impact and human persistence. The Origin of the Lost Bitcoin Fortune The tale begins back in 2013. James Howells had been one of the early adopters of Bitcoin, mining thousands of coins on a Dell laptop. After spilling a drink on the laptop, he disassembled it and kept the hard drive, thinking he might recover data later. However, during a clear-out, the crucial hard drive – which held the private keys to access over 8,000 BTC – was mistakenly thrown away and ended up in the local landfill site in Newport, Wales. At the time, Bitcoin’s value was relatively low, and the loss didn’t seem catastrophic. But as BTC’s price soared over the following years, reaching tens of thousands of dollars per coin, the true magnitude of the loss became staggering. The 8,000+ BTC, at its peak valuation, represented a fortune exceeding $800 million, making it one of the most valuable instances of lost Bitcoin in history. Why is This Bitcoin Recovery Story So Compelling? Howells’ quest resonates with people for many reasons. It’s more than just a story about lost money; it touches upon universal themes: The Scale of the Loss: The sheer amount of value lost is almost unfathomable, capturing the imagination. Relatability: Everyone has lost something important, but losing hundreds of millions due to a simple mistake amplifies that feeling dramatically. Tech Meets Trash: A cutting-edge digital asset is lost in the most mundane, physical place – a landfill. The contrast is stark. Persistence Against Odds: Howells has spent a decade battling bureaucracy, skepticism, and logistical nightmares, showcasing incredible determination. The Environmental Dilemma: The potential environmental impact of digging up a massive landfill site adds a layer of complexity and debate to the mission. This mix of high finance, personal tragedy, technological mystery, and environmental concern makes the Bitcoin recovery story uniquely captivating. The Landfill Bitcoin Challenge: More Than Just Digging Recovering a hard drive from a landfill isn’t like finding a needle in a haystack; it’s like finding a specific grain of sand on a vast beach. The Newport landfill is enormous, receiving thousands of tons of waste annually. Howells’ hard drive could be buried under meters of garbage accumulated over the past decade. The challenges are immense: Logistics: Excavating the relevant section of the landfill requires heavy machinery, a large team, and sophisticated sorting technology. Cost: Howells has estimated the operation could cost millions of dollars, requiring significant investment and funding. Environmental Concerns: Disturbing the landfill could release harmful gases, contaminate soil and groundwater, and disrupt local ecosystems. The Newport City Council has repeatedly cited environmental risks as a primary reason for denying his requests for excavation permits. Technology: Howells’ recovery plans involve cutting-edge technology, including AI-powered sorting machines to identify potential hard drives among the waste and even robotic dogs for surveying the site. Regulatory Hurdles: Gaining permission from the local council and environmental agencies has been the biggest roadblock, highlighting the complex interplay between personal wealth, technological ambition, and public/environmental safety. Finding the specific hard drive is just the first step; there’s also the question of whether it’s still functional after years of exposure to the elements and pressure within the landfill. This uncertainty adds another layer of drama to the Landfill Bitcoin saga. Lebul’s Vision: A Crypto Documentary Like No Other Lebul’s acquisition of the rights signals a major effort to bring this story to a mainstream audience. Their multi-platform approach is designed to capture different facets of the narrative: The Docuseries: This will likely be the core of the project, providing a chronological narrative of Howells’ life, the loss, the realization of the value, and his relentless efforts to recover the drive. It can explore the technical aspects of Bitcoin, the environmental debate surrounding the landfill, and the human drama of pursuing such an unlikely goal. The Podcast: A podcast format allows for deeper dives into specific topics, interviews with experts (on blockchain, environmental science, landfill management), and perhaps even a week-by-week update if the recovery attempt ever gets underway. Social-First Content: Short, engaging clips and visuals tailored for social media platforms can help build buzz and explain complex ideas in an accessible way, reaching a younger, digitally-native audience interested in crypto and unique stories. By blending compelling storytelling with explanations of blockchain technology and discussions on environmental responsibility, Lebul aims to create a Crypto documentary that appeals beyond just the crypto community, drawing in viewers interested in true crime, environmental issues, or simply incredible human interest stories. What Does This Mean for James Howells Bitcoin? For James Howells, this development is a significant step. Having the rights acquired by an entertainment company like Lebul not only validates the dramatic potential of his story but also provides a platform to potentially gain wider support or even attract investors for his complex recovery operation. While the docuseries itself won’t recover the hard drive, the increased public awareness and potential funding could bring him closer to his goal. Howells has always maintained that if he succeeds, he plans to share a significant portion of the recovered fortune with the city of Newport, funding local projects and even an environmental cleanup of the landfill site. This proposed philanthropic element adds a layer of altruism to the pursuit of immense personal wealth, making the James Howells Bitcoin narrative even more intriguing. The Broader Lesson: Securing Your Crypto While Howells’ story is unique in its scale and location, the underlying issue of lost private keys is a significant one in the crypto world. Millions of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are estimated to be permanently lost due to misplaced hard drives, forgotten passwords, or lost seed phrases. Howells’ experience serves as a dramatic, albeit extreme, reminder of the importance of secure private key management and storage. Unlike traditional banks, there’s no customer service line to call when you lose access to your digital assets. Conclusion: A Modern Treasure Hunt Unfolds James Howells’ quest for his lost Bitcoin from a Welsh landfill is a modern-day treasure hunt unlike any other. It’s a story packed with immense value, technological hurdles, environmental debates, and the sheer willpower of one individual. Lebul’s commitment to developing a comprehensive content project around this saga ensures that this fascinating intersection of crypto, environment, and human drama will be explored in depth, offering audiences a captivating look at one of the most unique stories in the history of digital currency. As Lebul begins production, the world will be watching to see how this incredible Bitcoin recovery story is told.

The firm filed the preliminary prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on April 29. According to the filing , the shares will track BlackRock’s BLF Treasury Trust Fund (TTTXX), a $150 billion fund that invests mainly in US Treasury bills, notes, cash, and other obligations issued and guaranteed by the US Treasury. The firm stated that the shares will be sold through the Bank of New York (BNY) Mellon, with the bank keeping a mirror record of transactions and share ownership on the blockchain. However, it added that the fund does not currently use blockchain technology. The preliminary prospectus reads: “Although the Fund does not currently employ blockchain technology or invest in crypto assets, the Financial Intermediary through whom shareholders purchase and redeem DLT Shares intends to employ blockchain technology to maintain a mirror record of share ownership for its customers.” Unsurprisingly, the product is only available to institutional investors with a minimum investment of $3 million to participate. The firm has yet to propose a ticker for the DLT shares but specified that the management fee will be 0.18%. Tokenized treasuries already over $6 billion The move by BlackRock highlights the continued exploration of blockchain technologies by traditional financial institutions to launch new products. BlackRock is already a key participant in this sector with its tokenized US Treasury product, BUIDL, being the biggest tokenized treasury product. The firm is bullish on blockchain technology and tokenization with the chairman, Larry Fink, identifying the importance of tokenization in making financial products more accessible to investors. According to data from rwa.xyz , BUIDL, which is a product of Securitize and BlackRock, currently has $2.556 billion in assets under management (AUM) and has seen a net inflow of more than $600 million in the last 30 days. With only 70 holders, its performance captures the solid interest in tokenized products, especially from institutional investors in the decentralized finance sector. BlackRock BUIDL has seen the highest netflow in the last 30 days (Source: rwa.xyz) However, other tokenized treasury products are also attracting sizable interest, even if they are not growing on a similar level as BUIDL. Overall, the sector now has $6.16 billion in AUM from 44 products. The next product with the highest AUM after BUIDL is Franklin Templeton’s BENJI, with $706.77 million. Others, such as Superstate USTB, Ondo USDY, and OUSG, and Circle USYC, also have over $400 million in AUM each. Despite the growth of these products, many industry experts believe this is still an early stage, and the sector is primed for more growth. Standard Chartered experts predict that the tokenization market could be worth $30 trillion by 2030. BlackRock IBIT sees record inflows Meanwhile, BUIDL is not the only crypto-related product from BlackRock that has enjoyed a massively positive performance in recent times. The firm’s Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), IBIT, also recorded its second-largest daily inflow since launch, with $970.9 million on Monday. Its inflows on that day contrast with the outflows from competing products, such as Ark 21 Shares ARKB, Fidelity’s FBTC, and Bitwise’s BITB. However, IBIT’s performance was still enough to offset these outflows and ensure $591.2 million in net flow for Bitcoin ETFs. The product, which has over $50 billion in AUM, has pulled in more than $4.5 billion in inflows since April 22 and accounts for 51% of the value of all spot Bitcoin ETFs .

A substantial movement of Grayscale Ethereum has just occurred, signaling potential shifts in how large holders manage their assets. What Happened with the Grayscale Ethereum Wallet? According to data tracked by blockchain analytics platform Arkham, a specific crypto wallet identified as potentially linked to Grayscale initiated a significant transfer. Roughly an hour ago, this wallet moved 3,909 ETH to Coinbase Prime. At the time of the transfer, this amount of Ethereum was valued at approximately $6.95 million. Here’s a quick breakdown: Sender: Wallet potentially linked to Grayscale Recipient: Coinbase Prime Amount: 3,909 ETH Approximate Value: $6.95 million (at the time of transfer) Source: Arkham data Grayscale is one of the largest digital asset managers, known for its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE). Movements from wallets associated with such major players are always noteworthy as they can provide insights into institutional sentiment and strategy. Why Transfer to Coinbase Prime? The destination of the transfer is equally important. Coinbase Prime is Coinbase’s platform specifically designed for institutional clients. It offers advanced trading features, secure custody solutions, and prime brokerage services tailored for large-scale investors and corporations. Moving assets to Coinbase Prime could indicate several potential actions: Preparation for trading (buying or selling). Transferring assets for secure custody under Coinbase’s institutional-grade infrastructure. Internal restructuring or rebalancing of assets within Grayscale or an affiliated entity. Meeting redemption requests, although this is less common for ETH trusts compared to GBTC historically, it’s a possibility depending on the specific fund structure. The precise reason for this specific transfer isn’t immediately clear from the transaction data alone, adding a layer of mystery to the movement. Potential Impact on ETH Price Whenever a large amount of an asset like Ethereum moves, especially to an exchange platform like Coinbase Prime, market participants naturally wonder about the potential impact on its price. At the moment, the ETH price is trading around $1,750.16, reflecting a decrease of 2.65% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. A transfer of this size to an institutional trading platform *could* signal potential selling pressure if the intent is to offload assets onto the market. However, as mentioned, it could just as easily be a move for custody or internal management that has no immediate impact on market supply. It’s crucial not to jump to conclusions based on a single transaction. While a $6.95 million transfer is significant for an individual, it’s a relatively small amount compared to Ethereum’s overall market capitalization (which is in the billions). Nevertheless, tracking such large crypto wallet movements is a key part of understanding the broader flow of institutional crypto capital. Following Institutional Crypto Wallet Activity Tracking the on-chain movements of large players is a fascinating aspect of the crypto market. Platforms like Arkham, Etherscan, and others allow anyone to observe these transactions, providing transparency that isn’t always available in traditional finance. Key things to watch for after such a transfer include: Are the funds subsequently moved from Coinbase Prime to other wallets or exchanges? Is there a noticeable increase in ETH selling volume on Coinbase or Coinbase Prime? Are there follow-up transfers from other Grayscale-linked wallets? Does the market react significantly in the hours or days following the transfer? Understanding institutional crypto movements helps piece together the larger market narrative beyond just price charts. Conclusion: Keeping an Eye on Grayscale Ethereum The transfer of 3,909 ETH from a wallet associated with Grayscale to Coinbase Prime is a notable event in the institutional crypto space. While the exact purpose remains unconfirmed, it highlights how major asset managers are actively managing their digital holdings. Whether this move precedes trading activity or is purely for operational reasons, it serves as a reminder of the constant flow of capital within the Ethereum ecosystem and the increasing sophistication of institutional participation. Market participants will be watching closely for any subsequent movements or market reactions that might shed more light on the intent behind this significant transfer.

With massive ROI rumors flying around and new projects causing waves before even launching, early access has become the golden ticket. Projects like Fartcoin, Tutorial, Fwog, Moo Deng, Just a Chill Guy, WHY, and SPX6900 are heating up — but one feline coin, you-know-who, is clawing its way to the top. Meme coin madness isn’t just about fun branding anymore. It’s about innovation, scarcity, and timing. These coins are leveraging playful narratives, viral engagement, and community power to offer serious potential gains. And if recent history has taught anything, it’s this — those who pounce early tend to be the ones walking away with their bags full. Among all the chaos, whispers of a cat-themed coin — let’s just say it’s sleek, stealthy, and stirring a storm on Trollercat.com — are echoing through the crypto alleys. This article breaks down why meme coins like WHY, Fwog, and the inescapable Troller Cat are catching fire among analysts and crypto chasers alike. But before we dive in, let’s talk about why Troller Cat’s whitelist might just be the smartest click you’ll make all year. 1. Troller Cat ($TCAT) Whitelist: Your Ticket to Early Access Glory Troller Cat’s whitelist is closing in fast, and the countdown is very real. Those who sign up now will gain exclusive access to the upcoming presale launching on May 2nd, 2025, at 6 PM UTC. What does that mean for potential buyers? Simple. First dibs at what many in the space are calling 2025’s most anticipated meme coin launch. With talks of a 10,000% ROI swirling, missing this could be one of those tales you’ll tell in regret. Whitelist access grants users an edge in securing tokens at the lowest possible entry point before the masses pour in. It’s not just early — it’s strategic. The chance to lock in prices before the floodgates open often means those who whitelist see the highest upside when prices moon. With Trollercat.com buzzing and registrations surging, this whitelist isn’t just another form — it’s a financial strategy. Why Whitelisting Troller Cat May Be Your Smartest Move of 2025 There’s a reason crypto analysts and alpha groups are whispering about Troller Cat. The project is building serious momentum, but it’s the whitelist advantage that has tongues wagging. Early participants won’t just get a head start; they may also unlock access to future staking rewards, rumored to be highly generous to those entering at the ground floor. Even better? Rumors suggest a play-to-earn Game Center could soon launch under the Troller Cat banner, adding a deflationary twist to the coin’s design. Translation: Token supply shrinks while demand spikes — classic economics that could fuel rapid price increases. This isn’t just a coin; it’s an ecosystem in the making. And whitelisting now? It’s like holding the backstage pass to the biggest meme coin concert of 2025. 2. WHY ($WHY): The Meme Coin with a Message WHY isn’t just a meme coin — it’s a bold philosophical question wrapped in crypto flair. With its simple name and profound undertones, WHY has sparked curiosity across social media, helping it achieve viral traction in the memecoin universe. It doesn’t rely solely on gimmicks; instead, WHY invites its holders to ponder bigger meanings while participating in a thriving decentralized economy. The token’s branding aligns well with modern internet culture — edgy, minimalist, and self-aware. As influencers and content creators increasingly latch onto meme tokens with depth and irony, WHY finds itself in a sweet spot between satire and substance. Its ongoing roadmap teases interactive tools and community challenges designed to keep users engaged. 3. Tutorial ($TUT): The Learn-to-Earn Meme Marvel Tutorial might sound like a crypto course, but it’s a meme coin project that flips the script on traditional education models. Designed to integrate learning and earning, Tutorial gamifies crypto knowledge, making it particularly popular with newer investors seeking both fun and fundamentals. The coin is buzzing in online communities thanks to its user-centric approach. With rumors swirling about potential integrations with decentralized learning platforms and quirky in-app features, Tutorial’s trajectory could surprise even seasoned traders. The playful name, paired with its instructional twist, is a smart branding move that caters to Gen Z and Gen Alpha. 4. Fwog ($FWOG): Froggy Frenzy in the Memeverse Fwog is leaping into the meme coin scene with a splash of nostalgia and a quirky amphibious twist. Drawing inspiration from internet frog memes and vintage web culture, Fwog has charmed the crypto crowd with its ribbiting personality. It’s community-focused and consistently hosts quirky giveaways and frog-themed events, making it one of the most engaging tokens in 2025. Fwog isn’t just hopping on trends — it’s carving a unique lane with speculative utility in gaming and digital collectibles. Analysts are closely watching as this frog-themed favorite begins to gain traction with both memecoin veterans and newcomers. 5. Just a Chill Guy ($CHILLGUY): Laid-back Lambo Dreams Just a Chill Guy embraces the chill vibe of internet culture. Unlike the typical hype-driven coin, this project plays it cool — literally. With branding centered around zen memes, cozy aesthetics, and good vibes, Just a Chill Guy has cultivated a loyal fan base that prefers the slow-and-steady approach to meme creation. This meme coin is rumored to explore relaxation-based metaverse hubs and passive income utilities that match its calm branding. Think of it as a digital hammock for those tired of market chaos. That relaxed angle makes it highly shareable and trend-worthy on platforms like Reddit and TikTok. 6. SPX6900 ($SPX): Bull Market Energy in Token Form SPX6900 is the meme coin for the traders who live and breathe charts. Named in reference to the S&P 500 hitting astronomical levels, this token celebrates the bullish spirit of the market. With chart memes, laser eyes, and peak speculation energy, SPX6900 gives meme traders a reason to cheer every green candle. The token’s high-octane branding connects strongly with financial meme culture — think stonks, diamond hands, and moon missions. Backed by meme-savvy devs and community mods who pump out relentless memes, it’s no surprise SPX6900 has rocketed into trending territories. 7. Moo Deng ($MOODENG): The Meme Cow Goes Crypto Moo Deng is a hilarious, bovine-themed meme coin that milks humor for all it’s worth. With moo memes galore and a decentralized farmer vibe, this token grazes the fields of virality. Its unique name and marketing have helped it surpass the competition and draw in meme coin ranchers from across the web. From cow-themed NFT drops to moo-sical collaborations, Moo Deng’s roadmap is as wild as its community. The coin has gained traction, particularly in regions where meme culture and agriculture intersect, creating a unique fusion of offline and online appeal. 8. Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN): Comedy Gold on the Blockchain If there’s one coin that isn’t afraid to go full send on toilet humor, it’s Fartcoin. Fueled by flatulence and fueled by fun, Fartcoin is the kind of project that doesn’t take itself too seriously — and that’s precisely why it’s becoming a fan favorite. This gas-powered meme token has taken over social media with its crude but catchy branding. Fartcoin memes, NFTs, and lowbrow humor are lighting up the crypto corners of the internet, and the community is anything but silent (pun intended). Despite the laughs, Fartcoin’s devs are surprisingly serious about keeping the tokenomics tight. Conclusion Based on the latest research, Troller Cat whitelist coins are Troller Cat, WHY, Tutorial, Fwog, Just a Chill Guy, SPX6900, Moo Deng, and Fartcoin. Each brings its flavor of madness to the crypto space, but one name is clawing its way ahead of the pack — Troller Cat. With its whitelist phase ending soon and a presale on the horizon, Trollercat.com offers a rare opportunity for ground-floor entry. The rumors around deflationary mechanics, sky-high staking returns, and a 10,000% ROI are just the beginning. Missing this could be like ignoring Bitcoin at $1.

This move has sparked considerable discussion, particularly within the tech and labor sectors, raising questions about the future of work alongside technological innovation. Let’s delve into how Duolingo AI is reshaping its platform and the subsequent reactions. Duolingo Embraces Generative AI for Massive Expansion Duolingo recently unveiled a staggering launch: 148 new language courses. This announcement, made on Wednesday, signifies a monumental expansion, effectively doubling the company’s existing course catalog. What’s truly remarkable is the speed at which this was achieved. According to Duolingo co-founder and CEO Luis von Ahn, creating the first 100 courses took approximately 12 years. In stark contrast, nearly 150 new courses were developed and launched in about a year, thanks largely to the integration of generative AI . Von Ahn highlighted this rapid scaling as a direct benefit of their investment in AI and automation, stating it allows them to scale at “unprecedented speed and quality.” This acceleration in content creation is a key outcome Duolingo is touting from its AI-first strategy. The Controversial Side: Duolingo Contractors and AI While the launch of numerous new courses is a positive for learners seeking more language options, the timing coincides with significant backlash Duolingo is facing. The controversy stems from the company’s stated intention to replace human contractors with AI for certain tasks. An internal email from CEO Luis von Ahn revealed plans to “gradually stop using contractors to do work that AI can handle” and that future hiring would be contingent on teams being unable to automate their work further. This shift towards becoming an “AI-first” company, as described by Von Ahn, is presented internally as a necessity for scaling content creation to meet global demand. He argued that manual content creation “doesn’t scale” and that AI is crucial for getting content to learners faster. However, this perspective has been met with considerable criticism externally. What Does This Mean for AI Language Courses and Quality? The rapid development of AI language courses raises questions about quality and accuracy. In the past, building a single Duolingo course was a multi-year effort involving language experts and educators. Now, generative AI is playing a central role in the content creation process. Duolingo asserts that its AI and automation investments allow for both speed and quality, but some users remain skeptical. The backlash on social media isn’t solely about job displacement; it also includes user concerns about the quality of AI-generated content. Some users have reported encountering inaccuracies or lower-quality content they attribute to the increased use of AI within the app. These concerns highlight an ongoing debate in the AI space: balancing the efficiency and scalability offered by AI with the nuances and quality often associated with human expertise, particularly in fields like education and language. The Impact of AI Content Creation The situation at Duolingo serves as a prominent example of the disruptive potential of AI content creation . The ability to generate educational material at an unprecedented pace could democratize access to learning, offering courses in languages that were previously too costly or time-consuming to develop manually. The 148 new courses, primarily aimed at beginner levels, include features like Stories and DuoRadio, designed to enhance reading and listening comprehension. However, this efficiency comes with significant implications for the human workforce, specifically the contractors who previously performed tasks now being automated. The narrative from Duolingo focuses on the benefits for learners and the mission of making language learning accessible, while the reaction from users and the public often centers on the human cost and potential impact on content quality. Looking Ahead: More Advanced AI-Powered Content? Duolingo plans to continue leveraging AI for future content development. While the initial wave of 148 courses focuses on beginner levels, the company intends to launch more advanced content in the coming months. This suggests a deeper integration of AI across the platform, potentially impacting how lessons are structured, personalized, and delivered. The company’s commitment to being “AI-first” indicates that artificial intelligence will play an increasingly central role in all aspects of its operations, from content creation to potentially user interaction and personalized learning paths. The success of this strategy will likely depend on Duolingo’s ability to maintain high content quality, address user concerns about AI-generated errors, and navigate the complex social and ethical implications of automating roles previously held by humans. Summary: A Double-Edged Sword? Duolingo’s massive launch of 148 AI language courses demonstrates the immense potential of generative AI to accelerate content creation and scale educational offerings rapidly. This aligns with the company’s mission to make language learning accessible globally. However, the simultaneous decision to replace contractors with AI has sparked significant backlash, raising critical questions about job security, the value of human contribution, and the potential impact of AI on content quality. As Duolingo moves forward with its AI-first approach, the tech world will be watching closely to see how it balances innovation, user experience, and the societal implications of automation.

However, bulls have failed to push decisively above the $155 resistance zone, a key level that could open the door to a broader rally. While the current price action favors buyers, the failure to break higher suggests that a retrace may be on the table if momentum continues to fade. Related Reading: Chainlink Flashes Daily Buy Signal – Breakout Next? Top analyst Jelle shared insights on X, noting that Solana’s monthly candle “is not looking too shabby.” According to Jelle, SOL took out all the consolidation lows and still managed to close the candle back above those levels—a positive technical signal suggesting resilience and potential continuation. Still, traders remain cautious, with many watching the $155–$160 area as the next big hurdle. A confirmed breakout above that zone could signal a move toward previous highs, while continued rejections might trigger a healthy correction into lower demand levels. With global markets still dealing with macroeconomic uncertainty, the next few sessions will be crucial for SOL. Bulls must act quickly to defend current levels and reclaim higher ground if they want to keep the trend in their favor. Solana At A Pivotal Level Amid Market Uncertainty Solana is currently trading at a critical level that could serve as a major pivot point for either a strong bullish recovery or a continuation of the broader bearish trend. While global tensions and ongoing trade conflicts between the U.S. and China continue to weigh on investor sentiment, recent market behavior hints at a potential bounce. The broader crypto market has shown signs of resilience, and Solana has been one of the standout performers. Since early April, Solana has climbed over 58%, recovering significantly from its local low near $95. This upward movement has helped shift short-term sentiment, but the price now faces a key test at the $160 resistance level. A clean break and hold above this zone could open the door for a larger rally, potentially taking SOL toward its previous highs. Jelle’s optimistic analysis highlights that Solana’s latest monthly candle is showing strength. According to Jelle, SOL took out all the consolidation lows and still managed to close the month back above them—typically a bullish sign. This sets the stage for a possible retest of the $240 level, a target that aligns with historical resistance and previous price action. However, failure to clear $160 could lead to renewed selling pressure, especially if global macro conditions worsen. For now, bulls must defend current levels and aim for a breakout to maintain momentum. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates Against Bitcoin – Dominance Shift On The Horizon? Crucial Test At $160 Resistance Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $147 after several days of struggling to break above the recent high of $157. Bulls have maintained control in the short term, but momentum appears to be fading as price action continues to stall below the key $160 resistance zone. This level remains a crucial barrier that needs to be reclaimed decisively to confirm a continuation of the uptrend. To sustain the bullish structure and avoid a deeper retracement, SOL must push through $160 and target the $180 level next. A successful move above this range would not only restore confidence but could also set the stage for a stronger recovery in the broader altcoin market. However, the longer Solana fails to break higher, the greater the risk of a pullback. If bulls lose momentum and selling pressure builds, a correction into the $130–$120 zone becomes increasingly likely. This area has previously served as a key demand zone and could offer support if tested again. Related Reading: Ethereum Shows 4H Bearish Divergence – Can Bulls Hold $1,750?

According to sources familiar with the negotiations, Ripple offered between $4 billion and $5 billion, but Circle turned down the proposal, reportedly viewing it as undervalued. Crypto M&A Activity Heats Up This attempted acquisition comes during a surge in crypto-related mergers, acquisitions, and IPOs. With digital assets experiencing renewed momentum and investor enthusiasm, several major players are preparing to go public. Firms such as Kraken, BitGo, Gemini, and Bullish are expected to seek IPOs in 2025, encouraged by the current pro-crypto political climate under the Trump administration. Circle itself has shown public market ambitions. Earlier this month, it filed for an initial public offering (IPO) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, aiming for a listing on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ‘CRCL’. However, just days later, reports suggested that Circle was considering delaying the IPO due to economic uncertainty stemming from shifting U.S. trade policies. Similar caution has been seen with companies like Klarna and StubHub, which are also weighing the risks of an IPO delay. Ripple’s Strategic Playbook Ripple’s interest in Circle aligns with its broader acquisition strategy. Notably, Ripple recently agreed to acquire Hidden Road, a prime brokerage firm, for $1.25 billion. This acquisition underscores Ripple’s desire to expand its ecosystem through strategic purchases rather than public fundraising. Monica Long, Ripple’s president, made it clear that Ripple is not currently considering an IPO. In an interview with CNBC, she emphasized the company’s strong financial position: “We have billions in cash reserves. We don’t need to raise capital or increase market exposure by going public.” She added, “Companies usually IPO to raise funds or elevate their brand. We’re not in need of either right now.” The Stablecoin Race: Ripple vs. Circle Ripple has also entered the stablecoin market with RLUSD, signaling its intent to compete with Circle’s dominant USDC. However, it has a long road ahead. As of May 1, RLUSD had a market cap of $317 million, dwarfed by USDC’s $62 billion valuation, according to CoinGecko. Despite the setback with Circle, Ripple may still pursue a revised offer. The company’s long-term strategy seems focused on acquisitions and internal growth rather than going public, especially after resolving its long-standing legal battle with the SEC.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|USDC,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-04-30 23:20:05

These components are crucial for training and running the sophisticated AI models that are rapidly changing industries. As the global competition in artificial intelligence heats up, governments are increasingly looking at ways to manage the flow of this critical technology. Recently, a major player in the AI space, Anthropic AI, weighed in on proposed U.S. regulations concerning the export controls of these essential AI chips. Understanding the Proposed US Export Controls on AI Chips The U.S. government has put forward a framework designed to strengthen export controls on domestic-made AI chips. This initiative stems from concerns over national security and the desire to maintain the U.S.’s lead in the AI sector, particularly in the context of the US China AI race. The proposed rules, expected to take effect around May 15, aim to create a tiered system for countries receiving these chips: Tier 3: Countries already under existing restrictions, like China and Russia, would face additional, stringent limitations. Tier 2: Countries such as Mexico and Portugal would encounter export restrictions for the first time, including caps on the quantity of chips they could acquire without special review. Tier 1: Allies like Japan and South Korea would largely continue without new export restrictions. This framework represents a significant step in U.S. AI policy, reflecting a strategic effort to control the diffusion of advanced AI capabilities globally. Why Does Anthropic AI Support Export Controls? Anthropic AI, a prominent U.S.-based AI lab, has publicly expressed its support for the government’s framework. In a recent blog post, the company stated it “strongly supports” the Department of Commerce’s proposal. This stance aligns with the broader goal of ensuring the U.S. remains competitive in the AI landscape. The company acknowledges that controlling the flow of advanced AI chips is a necessary measure in the ongoing US China AI race, where technological superiority is increasingly linked to economic and national security. Unlike some other tech giants, such as Nvidia, which previously voiced concerns that the proposed export controls were “unprecedented and misguided” and could hinder global innovation, Anthropic AI sees these measures as fundamentally beneficial for U.S. interests and long-term AI development. What Specific Tweaks Does Anthropic Suggest for AI Policy? While broadly supportive, Anthropic AI isn’t suggesting the framework is perfect. The company proposed specific adjustments to refine the implementation of these export controls. Their suggestions aim to improve the effectiveness and control mechanisms of the policy: Lowering Tier 2 Chip Caps: Anthropic recommends reducing the number of AI chips that Tier 2 countries can purchase without undergoing a formal review process. Encouraging Government-to-Government Deals: To compensate for lower direct purchase caps and potentially mitigate risks like smuggling, Anthropic suggests encouraging Tier 2 countries to acquire chips through formal government-to-government agreements. This approach could provide the U.S. with greater oversight and control over where the chips ultimately end up. Increasing Enforcement Funding: Anthropic also highlighted the importance of robust enforcement. The company believes the U.S. government should allocate more resources to ensure these export controls are properly monitored and implemented effectively across all tiers. These suggestions indicate Anthropic AI’s focus not just on the existence of controls but on their practical execution and ability to achieve their stated goals. The Role of Export Controls in the US China AI Race The debate over AI chips and export controls is intrinsically linked to the intensifying US China AI race. Both nations are investing heavily in AI research, development, and deployment. Advanced AI chips are foundational to this race, powering everything from sophisticated language models to autonomous systems and advanced computing. By controlling access to the most advanced U.S.-designed and manufactured chips, the U.S. government aims to slow down the progress of strategic competitors, particularly China, in areas deemed critical for national security. Anthropic AI’s support for these measures underscores the view within some parts of the U.S. AI industry that maintaining a technological lead requires strategic control over key components like AI chips. This perspective views export controls as a vital tool in the broader geopolitical competition. Leadership Perspectives: Dario Amodei on Export Controls The position taken by Anthropic AI is consistent with the public statements of its CEO, Dario Amodei. Mr. Amodei has been one of the more outspoken leaders in the U.S. AI community advocating for stronger export controls on advanced technology. He has argued that such controls are necessary to manage the risks associated with powerful AI and to ensure responsible development, particularly in a competitive global environment. His advocacy highlights that the discussion around AI policy and export controls is not limited to government officials but is actively debated within the highest levels of the AI industry itself, with varying perspectives on the best path forward. Summary: Anthropic’s Pragmatic Approach to AI Chips Policy In conclusion, Anthropic AI supports the U.S. government’s proposed export controls on AI chips as a means to bolster national security and maintain U.S. leadership in the US China AI race. While endorsing the core framework, the company offers pragmatic suggestions focused on refining the rules for Tier 2 countries and enhancing enforcement capabilities. Their position, championed by CEO Dario Amodei, emphasizes the importance of strategic AI policy in managing technological competition. This dialogue between government and leading AI labs like Anthropic is crucial as the U.S. navigates the complex challenges of regulating critical technologies in a rapidly changing world.

The rules will also apply to energy firms that provide electrical capacity to mining pools and companies headquartered outside Russia. Mining Crypto: VAT Charges Incoming in Russia Per the Russian media outlet RBC , the plans are the brainchild of the Ministry of Finance. The ministry said it wants to clarify the procedures for taxing the lease of crypto mining equipment. The Bitcoin network hashrate over the past three years. (Source: Blockchain.com) It also said that it wants to create tax rules for firms that provide “computing power for mining” to non-Russian clients. The VAT charges will likely apply to real-time, monthly, or annual leasing bills and transactions. The ministry said that a lack of “clear explanations” in current legislation has left providers unsure about how to declare their activities. New Charges for ‘Mining Infrastructure Operators’ A Russian law that came into force in January this year obliges all industrial crypto miners and “mining infrastructure operators (MIOs)” to sign up to a national register. The register is managed by the Federal Tax Service (FTS) , which is still finalizing plans to tax crypto miners and MIOs on their annual profits. Per the most recent FTS data, published on April 1, 116 MIOs have signed up to the register, along with 606 industrial miners. Both the FTS and other government organs believe that many more companies are still yet to sign up to the register. Commodities and shipping groups seek sanctions advice on return to Russia https://t.co/jMq6CUDaXf — FT Europe (@ftbrussels) April 30, 2025 Some have suggested introducing criminal liability for companies that fail to comply with the new law. But the FTS has urged leniency and suggested that some firms still need time to adjust to the new system. MIO firms typically provide space, equipment, and other facilities for mining crypto in custom-made data processing centers. These centers range from small buildings fitted with cooling equipment and fans to vast, factory-sized facilities capable of housing hundreds of Bitcoin mining rigs. El Salvador is still purchasing Bitcoin even after inking a loan agreement with the IMF that required it to stop accumulating the token https://t.co/uK12i0n4v7 — Bloomberg (@business) April 29, 2025 Crypto Mining Hotels Still Popular Small-scale crypto mining “hotels” also operate nationwide in Russia, with smaller centers offering total capacities of around 14 MW, and larger “hotels” boasting capacities of 100 MW and above. Investors and mining pools from all over the world have paid Russian MIOs to house their mining rigs, although some pulled out of the nation following the outbreak of war in Ukraine in February 2022. Regardless, many non-Russian pools and investors remain active in Russia, keen to access cheap electricity and relatively low overheads. The Industrial Mining Association (a collective comprising Russia’s biggest industrial miners) claimed in 2024 that if Moscow legalized mining, it could expect to reap tax revenues of around 50 billion rubles ($612 million) per year. The veracity of these claims will soon be put to the test. Some miners filed declarations on the April 25 tax deadline, meaning the world could soon learn how much tax Russia’s biggest crypto miners are now paying on their profits. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov. (Source: CNN/YouTube/Screenshot) Minister Wants Crypto Miners to Help Russian Firms Avoid Western Sanctions Lawmakers have taken a guarded stance. Anton Tkachev, the First Deputy Chairman of the State Duma’s IT Committee, said that April 25 was the industry’s first real tax test. The Russian Finance Minister, Anton Siluanov, stated early last year that his ministry did not expect crypto mining tax incomes to be “significant.” Siluanov instead suggested that Moscow will look to use the tokens produced from mining as settlement tools in foreign trade deals. Russian firms are increasingly looking to make crypto-powered cross-border trade deals using Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) as they remain frozen out of USD-denominated trade.

44003915,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154267,1746056408,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Exciting Release: JetBrains Mellum, An Open AI Coding Model",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/jetbrains-mellum-ai-coding/,"In the rapidly evolving world of technology and development, the intersection of AI and coding is becoming increasingly significant. For those in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, understanding the tools that shape the future of software development is key. A notable step in this direction comes from JetBrains, a company well-known for its comprehensive suite of developer tools. They have recently unveiled something particularly interesting: JetBrains Mellum , their first truly ‘open’ AI model designed specifically for coding. Introducing JetBrains Mellum: A New AI Coding Model JetBrains, the company behind popular integrated development environments (IDEs) like IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, and others, has made a significant move by releasing its own AI coding model , Mellum. This model, which was previously integrated into JetBrains’ commercial tools, is now openly available on the AI development platform Hugging Face. This move signals a commitment to contributing to the broader AI research and development community. Key details about Mellum: It’s designed primarily for code completion, helping developers write code faster and more efficiently by suggesting snippets based on context. Mellum is a relatively compact model, weighing in at 4 billion parameters. It was trained on a substantial dataset of over 4 trillion tokens. The training involved a cluster of 256 H200 Nvidia GPUs and took around 20 days. The model is released under the permissive Apache 2.0 license. Understanding the scale: Parameters roughly indicate a model’s complexity and problem-solving capacity, while tokens represent the raw data it processed during training. JetBrains notes that a million tokens correspond to about 30,000 lines of code, giving a sense of the vast amount of information Mellum learned from. Why an Open Source AI Model Matters The decision by JetBrains to release Mellum as an open source AI model on Hugging Face is noteworthy. While many powerful AI models remain proprietary, making Mellum openly available fosters transparency, collaboration, and further innovation within the developer community. An open model allows researchers, developers, and enthusiasts to: Inspect the model’s architecture and training data (where permissible). Experiment with its capabilities. Fine-tune it for specific tasks or programming languages. Integrate it into various tools and workflows beyond JetBrains’ own ecosystem. JetBrains explicitly states that Mellum is designed for integration into professional developer tooling, AI-powered coding assistants, and research on code understanding and generation. Its open nature also makes it suitable for educational purposes and fine-tuning experiments. Focus on Code Completion AI Unlike larger, more general-purpose AI models that can write essays or generate images, Mellum has a specific focus: code completion AI . This specialization allows the model to be highly optimized for the task of predicting and suggesting code snippets within an IDE or code editor. This is a core function of modern development environments and can significantly boost developer productivity. However, JetBrains is clear that the base Mellum model requires fine-tuning before it can be effectively used. They have provided some fine-tuned examples for Python, but these are intended for evaluation and estimation of potential capabilities, not for production deployment. This highlights that while the core model is open, practical application still requires effort to adapt it to specific needs and contexts. Implications for AI Development Tools and Security The release of Mellum contributes to the growing landscape of AI development tools . As AI becomes more integrated into the software development lifecycle, tools like Mellum will become essential for developers. They promise increased speed and efficiency, but also introduce new considerations, particularly regarding security. AI-generated code, while helpful, is not immune to vulnerabilities. A survey from late 2023 by Synk indicated that over 50% of organizations frequently encounter security issues with AI-produced code. JetBrains acknowledges this, noting that Mellum’s suggestions may reflect biases present in the public codebases it was trained on and won’t necessarily be secure or free of vulnerabilities. Developers must still apply rigorous testing and security practices when using AI-assisted coding. Despite the challenges, JetBrains sees this release as a starting point. Their goal isn’t necessarily generality but focus and contribution to the community. They hope Mellum will spark meaningful experiments and collaborations. In conclusion, JetBrains’ release of Mellum as an open AI coding model is a significant development for the software industry. By focusing on code completion AI and making the model available on Hugging Face, they are contributing to the ecosystem of AI development tools and fostering open research. While challenges like fine-tuning and security require attention, JetBrains Mellum represents a valuable resource for developers and researchers exploring the future of AI-assisted coding.

The May 7, Ethereum Pectra upgrade could boost investor sentiment, but ETH’s price action shows investors are still hesitant to open new positions. Ether ( ETH ) has been trading below $1,900 since March, leading investors to question whether the failed attempt to reclaim $4,000 in December 2024 signaled the end of an era for the leading altcoin. Concerns continue to mount as derivatives market data shows that professional traders remain cautious about ETH’s price outlook. ETH monthly futures should trade at a premium of 5% or more compared to spot markets to compensate for the longer settlement period, but this indicator has held below the neutral threshold. Ether 3-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas.ch Part of the lack of enthusiasm stems from disappointment with the United States government, as Ether was classified alongside other altcoins in the “Digital Asset Stockpile” Executive Order on March 6. The Trump administration decided that only Bitcoin ( BTC ) was significant enough to be included in its own “Strategic Reserve.” In practical terms, altcoins already held by the government could be retained, but not newly acquired. Ether's market cap falls below its top four rivals For the first time ever, in April 2025, Ether’s market capitalization dropped below the combined value of its four largest competitors: Solana ( SOL ), BNB, Cardano ( ADA ), and Tron ( TRX ). Ether market cap vs. the sum of SOL, BNB, ADA, TRX. Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph After rebounding from lows near $1,400, Ether’s total market capitalization now stands at $217 billion, which is enough to surpass the combined value of its four main competitors. However, unless Ether consistently outperforms these rivals, sentiment is unlikely to improve. Some traders have high hopes for the upcoming ‘Pectra’ network upgrade , but current derivatives data does not reflect a bullish outlook. Ether’s decline has also coincided with weak demand for the Ethereum spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. Institutional interest was lacking, despite ETH’s price rising from $2,400 to $4,000 between October and December 2024. In contrast, Bitcoin ETFs saw assets more than double, growing from $50 billion in October 2024 to $110 billion currently. Ethereum leads in TVL, but there’s a catch Although Ethereum remains dominant in terms of total value locked (TVL), it has struggled to match Solana’s integrated user experience or Tron’s dominance in the stablecoin sector . Traders appear uninterested in Ethereum’s higher decentralization or improved security, especially for activities involving frequent deposits and withdrawals, where layer-2 solutions provide limited benefits. The absence of demand for leveraged bullish ETH positions does not necessarily mean that professional traders expect further price declines. If whales and market makers were unwilling to offer downside protection, this would be reflected in the ETH options markets, signaling increased risk of a market downturn. ETH 30-day options skew (put-call) at Deribit. Source: Laevitas.ch Contrary to some expectations, put (sell) options are trading at levels similar to call (buy) options. Notably, professional traders are now more comfortable with downside risks than they were two weeks ago. While ETH derivatives are not signaling strong bullish sentiment, they also do not suggest that professional traders are worried about further declines at current price levels. Related: 3 Ethereum charts flash signal last seen in 2017 when ETH price rallied 25,000% There is a chance that the upcoming ‘Pectra’ network upgrade could positively affect Ether’s price. Scheduled for May 7, this event might renew investor interest in the project by closing the gap with some of its competitors. Staking mechanisms designed for institutional investors could result in more ETH being locked in validator nodes, reducing the circulating supply. Historically, Ethereum upgrades have often been associated with brief spikes in ETH’s price.

Analyst Ali Martinez tells his 136,500 followers on the social media platform X that XRP can surge as high as 30% from current levels after breaking out of an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. The structure is typically considered bullish as it suggests that buyers are ready to step in without waiting for the asset’s price to revisit recent lows. “XRP looks to be breaking out of an inverse head and shoulders pattern, with a potential upside target between $2.70 and $2.90.” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, XRP is worth $2.23. Looking at the top memecoin Dogecoin, Martinez says that DOGE needs to recover a key price level to gather momentum and trigger a potential rally toward its record high. “If Dogecoin DOGE can secure a monthly close above $0.20, it could pave the way for a rally toward its all-time high of $0.74. Such a breakout would signal strong bullish momentum and potentially attract increased investor interest.” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, DOGE is trading for $0.173. Turning to the layer-1 protocol Solana, Martinez believes that SOL is forming a large bullish continuation pattern that could send the altcoin to an astronomically high price target above $3,500. “Zooming out, Solana SOL appears to form a textbook-perfect cup and handle pattern!” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, SOL is trading at $145. As for the fellow layer-1 protocol Cardano ( ADA ), the trader says the altcoin needs to take out the diagonal resistance of a descending channel to spark new rallies. A descending channel suggests that an asset is in a downtrend as its price prints lower highs and lower lows. “Cardano ADA is approaching a major test at $0.74. A breakout above this level could pave the way for a move toward $0.88.” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, ADA is worth $0.694.

XRP, Optimism, Sei, and Ethereum Are Gaining Fast",https://thecoinrise.com/early-2025-momentum-xrp-optimism-sei-and-ethereum-are-gaining-fast/,"Crypto markets are showing fresh momentum in Q2 2025, and several key altcoins are leading the charge. XRP , Optimism (OP) , Sei (SEI) , and Ethereum (ETH) are all gaining attention for their bullish setups, institutional signals, or unique roles in the evolving blockchain ecosystem. As capital flows into well-positioned projects, traders and analysts alike are turning their focus to early indicators of breakout potential. Ethereum and XRP Continue to Lead Ethereum (ETH) is trading near $1,739 , supported by whale accumulation, healthy RSI levels, and bullish crossovers. Momentum is being driven by surging activity in AI-related tokens and a spike in on-chain volume. Forecasts for Ethereum’s price path in 2025 remain optimistic, with upside targets between $2,500 and $2,700 in the months ahead. XRP , currently around $2.15 , is benefiting from increased institutional access after the recent approval of XRP futures ETFs. Technical setups point toward a possible move beyond the $2.45 resistance zone, which could trigger renewed inflows from both retail and institutional investors. Optimism (OP) and Sei (SEI) Quietly Position for Growth Optimism (OP) remains one of Ethereum’s most critical Layer 2 scaling solutions. Although recent updates have been sparse, the project continues to evolve its ecosystem. With prices stable and real-time trades near $3.25 , OP is viewed as undervalued by many long-term holders awaiting a broader L2 resurgence. Sei (SEI) is maintaining momentum as a fast-growing infrastructure chain focused on trading and performance. Though lacking headline news recently, its real-time value around $0.29 reflects consistent market confidence. Analysts expect SEI to play a more visible role if demand for scalable, low-latency platforms increases.

These AI agents can browse products, make purchases, and handle payments on behalf of users, streamlining the online shopping experience.​ The AI agents will harness the latest technology introduced by some of the biggest tech companies, such as Visa, which collaborates with Microsoft, OpenAI, and Anthropic to realize this vision. Visa’s new system, Visa Intelligent Commerce, will enable consumers to assign an AI agent to perform tasks, like booking a vacation, making a grocery order, or finding a fashionable outfit — and do so within a budget and according to personal tastes. Jack Forestell, Visa’s Chief Product and Strategy Officer, said that just as the shift from physical to digital retail had accelerated, the transition to digital-first commerce was underway. The pilot program is set to launch this year, with a full rollout expected by 2026. Changing shopping habits force advertising shifts Visa CEO Ryan McInerney says AI agents will soon eliminate outdated forms of advertising. Instead of being influenced by flashy banners or social media hype, digital assistants will prioritize data, user behavior, reviews, pricing, and peer preferences to guide purchasing decisions. With AI in the driver’s seat, businesses can no longer rely solely on polished marketing campaigns to reach consumers. To stay competitive, they must deliver genuine value, meet real needs, and stand out in AI-driven recommendation engines. Experts say this change will force businesses to provide value and quality rather than compete for attention. McInerney said on Bloomberg TV that a seismic shift in advertising was coming, predicting it would become more personalized, data-driven, and likely more nuanced. In other words, AI agents could be the new gatekeepers between brands and buyers. Visa has already spent over $3 billion on AI and data infrastructure in the last 10 years alone, The company is leveraging AI not just to make shopping better but to make it easier and more secure to pay. Powered by Visa technology, these AI agents can securely and confidentially get access to someone’s payment credentials and make transactions with a provider rapidly and without any inconvenience. With Visa’s advanced systems , consumers will retain full control—setting purchase limits, approving transactions, and monitoring their spending in real-time. Outside of the U.S., Visa also considers opportunities in high-growth economies such as India. The company is also negotiating investment with local AI startups to expand its footprint and serve users in other regions better. Rivals such as Mastercard and PayPal are also moving into AI shopping. However, Visa is betting its partnerships and early investments will give it a solid lead in one of the fastest-evolving areas of payments. Visa leads the shift to AI-driven commerce The emergence of AI shopping agents heralds a new era in how people shop and companies sell. Instead of hours of searching online, people will tell an AI what they want, and the agent will handle all the work. It will find the best deals, compare quality, check reviews, and even handle payments. For customers, it equates to saving time while seeing better results. For brands, that means finding new ways of reaching and retaining customers. Visa is wagering that AI-enabled commerce will be the next normal. It sets itself up to control the whole process, from discovering products to receiving the payment. McInerney said that payments were certain to evolve to support these changes and added that Visa was looking forward to the role it would play in making it happen.

Charts Say It’s Possible,https://cryptonews.com/news/can-these-3-tokens-really-hit-1-charts-say-its-possible/,"Meme coins are heating up again – and the charts are flashing green. Several top tokens are now teasing breakout potential, backed by rising momentum and growing community hype. As crypto regains its spotlight in both tech and finance, these low-cost contenders are catching serious attention. Let’s dive into three sub-$1 meme coins that could be gearing up for a major move – and possibly a run to that elusive $1 milestone. Dogecoin ($DOGE): Charts Suggest a New Breakout for the Canine King of Meme Tokens Dogecoin ($DOGE) continues to lead the meme coin movement with a $26.2 billion valuation reaffirming its position as the keystone of the memeverse. First launched in 2013 by Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer as a playful experiment, DOGE has transformed into one of the most recognized digital currencies globally. Unlike the newer generation of meme coins, Dogecoin enjoys extensive liquidity and established market presence. Its price frequently moves in tandem with Bitcoin, offering a level of stability that most meme tokens struggle to achieve. At present, DOGE is trading at $0.1757 after dipping 2% in line with the rest of the meme coin market. However, Dogecoin is now breaking out of a descending wedge — a classic technical pattern associated with bullish reversals, which you can see in the diagonal falling support and resistance lines from November to April. With a Relative Strength Index (RSI) reading of 54, DOGE is looking to rally again. With a few market rallies expected in May the token’s supporters are eyeing a move toward $0.48 — representing a potential 173% return from current levels. Adoption trends remain strong, too. Tesla continues to accept DOGE for select transactions, while platforms like PayPal and Revolut have introduced DOGE into their payment systems, reinforcing its growing utility. MIND of Pepe ($MIND): Fusing AI Innovation With Meme Culture MIND of Pepe ($MIND) blends viral meme appeal with emerging AI technology, positioning itself as more than just another internet joke coin. While it draws aesthetic inspiration from the iconic Pepe meme, this token is backed by real utility. Token holders gain access to a suite of AI-powered tools — including a crypto oracle and automated sentiment bot — offering real-time analytics, market predictions, and trading signals. Monument. $MIND pic.twitter.com/pcAJjfbTLg — MIND of Pepe (@MINDofPepe) April 18, 2025 So far, the project has raised over $8.5 million in early funding rounds. For passive income seekers, staking $MIND offers attractive returns, with annual yields reaching as high as 267%. As artificial intelligence reshapes everything from finance to content creation, MIND of Pepe is carving out a niche at the intersection of fun and function. Stay connected with MIND of Pepe on X (formerly Twitter) and Telegram . Brett ($BRETT): The Meme King of the Base Network Like Pepe, Brett ($BRETT) is inspired by a character in Matt Furie’s Boy’s Club . Unlike Pepe though, Brett exists on Base — Coinbase’s proprietary Ethereum Layer 2 network. After months of downward consolidation, Brett has seen a powerful rebound, with the price currently stabilizing above $0.06311 after a strong breakout. The token recently broke through a long-standing falling wedge formation, peaking at $0.071 and signaling renewed optimism among traders. In the last week, Brett has advanced 33%. A brief sell-off is likely to nominally depreciate the price overnight, but if Brett gets to $0.08, it will have stronger support for a further sally. Backed by strong trading volume and improving sentiment, Brett looks poised for another leg higher, with $0.10 within reach — and if market enthusiasm intensifies, a longer-term move toward $1 remains a possibility.

SOL futures open interest hit $5.75 billion on April 30, showing strong institutional interest. With rising DEX volumes and a $9.5 billion TVL, SOL could rally to $200 before a potential spot ETF approval on Oct. 10. Solana’s native token, SOL ( SOL ), fell 4% between April 29 and April 30 after failing to sustain the $150 level. Despite this short-term decline, traders seem more confident as the $140 support remained intact for a whole week, an outcome that hadn’t happened in over two months. As demand for leveraged SOL positions reached near record highs on April 30, traders are now reconsidering the chances of a SOL rally above $200. Solana futures aggregate open interest, SOL. Source: CoinGlass SOL futures open interest climbed to 40.5 million SOL on April 30, marking a 5% increase from the previous month and nearing its all-time high. In dollar terms, this represents $5.75 billion in futures positions, ranking third in the cryptocurrency market and over 50% higher than the demand for XRP derivatives. This strong adoption of SOL derivatives points to growing institutional interest. Data shows increased demand for bearish leveraged SOL positions Traders often believe that increased demand for SOL futures signals rising optimism. However, since longs (buyers) and shorts (sellers) are always matched, a rise in open interest does not necessarily indicate a bullish outlook. To better understand leverage demand in SOL futures, one can look at the funding rate for perpetual contracts. ETH perpetual futures 8-hour funding rate. Source: Laevitas.ch Currently, the funding rate on SOL perpetual futures is negative, which shows more demand for bearish positions. The last period of moderate optimism ended on April 25 after a failed attempt to break above $156. The lack of bullish leveraged positions may be partly due to the 43% price gain SOL saw in the three weeks from April 8 to April 29. A $200 target for SOL may seem ambitious, but the token was trading near $195 in mid-February, even after decentralized application volumes had dropped by 80% from their January peak. While Solana has faced criticism for its heavy reliance on memecoins, there is more to the network than just speculation on new tokens. Total value locked (TVL) on Solana Network, USD. Source: DefiLlama Solana ranks second in total value locked (TVL), with $9.5 billion in deposits, including liquid staking , collateralized loans, automated yield platforms, and synthetic derivatives. Several Solana decentralized applications are among the top fee earners, with Meteora collecting $19.1 million in seven days, followed by Pump-fun with $18.6 million and Juto with $14.6 million. Solana network dominates volumes on decentralized exchanges Since April 14, Ethereum’s average base layer transaction fee has been $0.65 or less, yet Solana’s decentralized exchanges have seen nearly 90% higher trading volumes. Even when including the entire Ethereum layer-2 ecosystem, Solana led the past week with $21.6 billion in decentralized exchange activity. Decentralized exchange volumes, 7-day market share. Source: DefiLlama Positive highlights from the Solana network include an 87% weekly increase in Raydium’s volumes and a 58% rise in Meteora activity. So, even if demand for bullish leveraged positions stays flat, SOL’s price could eventually reflect the improved onchain metrics.

Analysts believe the final deadline for the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s decision is Oct. 10, with a 90% chance of approval. Still, SOL might rally above $200 before this event, as the network is well-positioned to attract new retail investors.

XRP, MATIC, Sei, and Arbitrum Offer Potential Upside",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/will-ethereum-fuel-the-next-big-move-xrp-matic-sei-and-arbitrum-offer-potential-upside/,"The cryptocurrency market is eyeing Ethereum (ETH) as a potential driver of broader altcoin momentum. With Ethereum hovering near $1,739 and maintaining bullish indicators, investors are closely watching correlated moves in assets like XRP , Polygon (MATIC) , Sei (SEI) , and Arbitrum (ARB) . All are showing varying degrees of promise—and as May begins, analysts expect an uptick in volatility and opportunity. Ethereum’s Setup and Ripple Effects Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading around $1,739 , following a strong April marked by whale accumulation and rising demand in AI-related tokens. Technical signals like a recent golden cross and a neutral RSI support the view that ETH may soon break past key levels toward $2,500 . Reduced transaction fees and on-chain activity growth are adding to the bullish case. Ethereum’s strength tends to spill over into Layer 2 ecosystems and select altcoins, making this a key moment for projects directly or indirectly linked to its growth. Altcoins to Watch: XRP, MATIC, SEI, and ARB XRP , trading at approximately $2.15 , is riding high on ETF-driven momentum. With the U.S. approval of XRP futures ETFs and upcoming launches on CME Group’s platform, institutional interest is spiking. Traders are watching for a breakout past $2.45 , which could lead to extended rallies. Polygon (MATIC) continues to benefit from Ethereum’s momentum. Though it’s seen consolidation recently, 2025 price projections remain bullish with expectations tied to post-halving trends. With real-time pricing between $1.02–$1.04 , MATIC remains a key player among scalable Ethereum-aligned solutions. Sei (SEI) , despite a quieter news cycle, is maintaining stable price levels. It continues to build core infrastructure, especially in the trading and finance layer. Market watchers suggest SEI could see renewed action as Layer 1 narratives heat up in Q2. Arbitrum (ARB) , trading around $0.35 , faces a more uncertain outlook. It recently dropped sharply after exiting Nvidia’s AI Accelerator program, triggering concern among investors. Still, if sentiment around Layer 2s improves, ARB could find renewed strength off its current support levels.

The pattern indicates that SOL is coiling up, potentially preparing for a significant move once a breakout occurs. This period of sideways trading isn’t without significance. Historically, such consolidation phases can act as a prelude to sharp breakouts or breakdowns. Traders are now closely watching for volume spikes or candlestick signals that could hint at the next major trend. Current Market Context: Why Solana Consolidation Matters GemXBT emphasized that key support lies below the current price, around the $146 level, which has acted as a crucial buffer, preventing further declines and helping to maintain short-term stability. On the upside, immediate resistance is forming near $150, a level that has previously halted bullish advances. This resistance zone is now being closely monitored, as a breakout above it could trigger a stronger upward push. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Holding Strong Above $150 — Breakout Zone In Play GemXBT further elaborated on the technical indicators that support SOL’s current consolidation outlook. He noted that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) continues to hover in the neutral zone, reflecting the prevailing market indecision. This midpoint reading indicates that neither bullish nor bearish momentum is dominant at the moment, which aligns with Solana’s sideways price movement. The lack of an overbought or oversold signal suggests that a breakout in either direction is still on the table, making the coming sessions particularly crucial for confirming the next trend. In addition, GemXBT highlighted that the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has recently formed a minor bearish crossover, which could be an early warning sign of building downward pressure. Although the signal isn’t strong enough to confirm a trend reversal yet, it does raise concerns, especially if the $147 support level fails to hold. The Battle Between Bulls And Bears Based on GemXBT analysis, as Solana continues to consolidate between the $146 and $150 range, the market is at a crucial indecision point. After breaking out of the zone between $146 and $150, the next resistance to watch is the $164 level. If buyers are able to push the price past this barrier, it could pave the way for a rally toward the $211 level and beyond, marking a significant shift in momentum and market sentiment. Related Reading: Solana Price Enters Consolidation Trend Above $130 That Could End In A Breakout However, if bearish pressure intensifies and the $146 support gives way, it might trigger a sharper decline as sellers regain control. In that case, lower support areas such as $137 and $118 would come into play quickly. With both Solana bulls and bears eyeing these pivotal levels, the next decisive move is likely to set the tone for SOL’s short-term trend.

The banking system is criticized for inefficiencies and prioritizing the ultra-wealthy. Eric Trump emphasizes the growing role of cryptocurrencies in shaping the future of finance. Eric Trump, the head of the Trump Organization in the United States, the son of the country’s President, has sounded a dire outlook on the future of traditional banking. During an interview with CNBC on April 30, 2025, he explained that if banks fail to adapt to the use of cryptocurrencies, they will be obsolete within the next 10 years. According to him, the emergence of crypto is a threat to the banking sector. He complained about the contemporary financial system, stating that it is ineffective and cumbersome to use. Eric Trump noted that existing banks are expensive and tend to favor catering to high-net-worth investors. In his opinion, this broken system, when combined with slow transaction methods such as SWIFT, has led him into the realm of cryptocurrencies.

Robinhood’s Q1 results shared on April 30 show revenues fell 8.6% from the previous quarter to $927 million, topping Zacks analyst estimates by 3.16%. The company’s crypto revenue plummeted nearly 30% quarter-on-quarter to $252 million from the firm’s record-setting Q4 2024. The drop could be partly attributed to the Trump administration’s tariffs, which triggered an 18% fall in the crypto market cap over the quarter. Crypto trading volume on Robinhood also fell 35% over Q1 compared to the fourth quarter of 2024, which the firm attributed to a 10% drop in customer trades placed and a 27% fall in average notional volume per trade. Robinhood CEO Vladimir Tenev said on an earnings call that crypto trading volumes would continue to fluctuate but the firm is more focused on capturing as much market share as possible. Despite the fall from last quarter, Robinhood’s crypto revenue rose 100% from the same quarter a year ago, while trading volumes jumped 28% over the same period.

Source: Robinhood The firm also added $500 million to its now $1.5 billion buyback authorization program, aimed at boosting shareholder value and confidence in the firm’s financial health. The company has bought back $667 million worth of shares so far. Shares in Robinhood (HOOD) rose 1.51% in after-hours trading on April 30 to $49.85 since the firm disclosed its Q1 results, Google Finance data shows. Tenev said Robinhood’s $200 million acquisition of Bitstamp crypto exchange is still looking likely to receive regulatory approval in the middle of 2025, which would enable it to serve institutional investors in the US. Regulatory pressure also eased for Robinhood in Q1 after the Securities and Exchange Commission closed its investigation into the firm’s crypto business on Feb. 21. Crypto tokenization remains a key focus for Robinhood Tenev said Robinhood is still exploring integrating crypto tokenization into the company’s services. Tokenizing private equities is a “huge unlock” for both individuals and companies that can solve a lot of problems in secondary market transactions, he said. Related: Ripple $4B-$5B bid to purchase Circle rejected — Report “I think that will unlock a ton of economic value for the crypto industry in the US,” Tenev said.

The accord was signed in Washington after months of tense negotiations, with uncertainty lingering until the final moments due to an eleventh-hour issue. This agreement establishes a joint investment fund for Ukraine’s reconstruction as Trump tries to secure a peace settlement in Russia’s three-year-old war in Ukraine. The correspondence is important to Kyiv’s efforts to improve its relationship with Trump and the White House, which was not good after he took office in January. U.S.-Ukraine pact seeks to cement support and economic recovery amid ongoing war According to a Treasury post on X, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Ukrainian First Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko were shown signing the agreement, which noted the deal “clearly signals the Trump Administration’s commitment to a free, sovereign, prosperous Ukraine.” Svyrydenko said on X that the accord allows Washington to contribute to the fund. Since Russia’s 2022 invasion, Washington has been Ukraine’s largest military donor, contributing over 64 billion euros ($72 billion) in aid, according to the Kiel Institute in Germany. Prior to the signing, Trump reiterated on Wednesday that the U.S. should receive something in return for its support to Kyiv, leading to the push for a deal focused on Ukraine’s abundant rare earth mineral deposits. In announcing the agreement, the U.S. Treasury pointed out that the U.S. has “provided significant financial and material support to Ukraine’s defense” following Russia’s invasion. A deal draft revealed that Ukraine won a removal of any obligation regarding reimbursing the U.S. for previous assistance, a point that Kyiv had vigorously fought. According to Ukrainian officials, the deal strengthened American support for Kyiv during the war. Still, the draft did not spell out any precise U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine, which was one of Kyiv’s top goals. In a separate move, Ukraine has been discussing with European allies the creation of an international force to help protect its security if a peace settlement is eventually reached with Russia. In a statement, the Treasury Department said the fund is in “recognition of the significant financial and material support that the people of the United States have provided to the defense of Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion” and will help “accelerate Ukraine’s economic recovery.” Minerals-for-aid deal revived after February fallout The current agreement appears to be the same as the original deal, which was set to be signed in February and indicated that Ukraine would put 50% of the proceeds from its state-owned mineral resources into a fund jointly owned with the U.S. The BBC reported that no security guarantees were outlined for Ukraine. The deal originated after President Donald Trump indicated Ukraine could give the U.S. access to its minerals in return for U.S. support of Ukraine in its ongoing war with Russia and described the potential agreement as a reimbursement for the U.S. aid. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy traveled to the U.S. in February to reportedly sign the deal. However, he left the White House without signing it after an Oval Office meeting between him and Trump ended in a shouting match . Zelenskyy put out a statement days after the visit saying he wanted to end the war with Russia and that Ukraine was ready to sign the minerals deal. He saw it as “a step toward greater security and solid security guarantees.” Back in February, experts expressed concerns about the cost and production times associated with mining raw materials, and some said the mining might not result in a huge payoff. Benchmark Minerals Intelligence rare earths pricing analyst George Ingall noted that the minerals the U.S. desired at the time “won’t be used to make a profit in the next 10 or 15 years.” Ingall also said operationalizing a rare earth mineral mine takes up to $2 billion. While a minerals deal may take time to benefit the U.S. financially, obtaining the natural resources from Ukraine could help reduce the U.S.’ reliance on China and Russia to import the materials.

This meteoric 412,055% surge underscores the crypto market’s potential for life-altering returns.

Starting at $0.006 its price soared to $3.84 by early 2018. This 63,900% spike turned modest investments into fortunes cementing XRP’s place in crypto lore. However regulatory battles particularly the SEC lawsuit have since capped its momentum. Despite a partial legal win in 2024, XRP’s growth remains tethered to market sentiment and institutional adoption.

As phase 4 nears its close the urgency to join before the 20% price hike to $0.03 in phase 5 intensifies. Presale Gains and Post-Launch Potential Investors snapping up Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens at $0.025 are poised for a 20% gain when phase 5 kicks in at $0.03. The tokenomics guarantee a 140% return at the $0.06 exchange listing a figure rooted in the presale’s structured pricing. Looking further analysts project a post-launch price of $2.75 in 2025 fueled by the platform’s lending innovations and growing adoption. This translates to a jaw-dropping 10,900% ROI from the current price dwarfing XRP’s recent performance. The team is also finalizing a Certik audit of its smart contracts with results soon to be shared on social channels bolstering trust as the project scales. Unlike XRP which leans on institutional partnerships Mutuum Finance (MUTM) thrives on user-driven DeFi utility. Its dual lending model—peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer—caters to diverse crypto assets while mtTokens accrue interest for depositors offering passive income. The $100,000 giveaway, awarding $10,000 in MUTM tokens to ten presale participants, adds fervor to the already brisk phase 4 sales. With 425 million tokens already claimed, the window to secure tokens at this low entry point is shrinking fast, echoing the early days of XRP’s ascent when timing was everything. Echoes of XRP’s Golden Era Mutuum Finance (MUTM) mirrors the early allure of XRP’s 2017 surge, where early adopters reaped colossal rewards. While XRP’s path now wades through regulatory fog, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a clearer runway with its presale structure and DeFi focus. A $1,000 investment today could yield $2,400 at listing or soar to $110,000 if the $2.75 target hits in 2025. Don’t miss out—join the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale now to lock in tokens before phase 5 raises the stakes.

Analysts predict XRP could rise to new all-time highs again in 2025. XRP price dropped by 5% over the past 24 hours as US GDP data showed a shrinking economy . However, a strengthening market structure and investors’ growing hope for a spot XRP ETF approval in the United States suggest that the altcoin might revisit its April peak at $2.36 in the short term. XRP/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/ TradingView Technical charts currently show XRP ( XRP ) trading within a falling wedge pattern. A ""falling wedge"" is a bullish reversal chart pattern that comprises two converging trend lines that connect lower lows and lower highs. This convergence indicates weakening downward momentum. The pattern will resolve when the price breaks above the upper trendline at $2.40, and if this happens, buyers could target $3.74 next, representing a 71% increase from the current price. XRP/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/ TradingView The relative strength index (RSI) is above the midline, indicating that the market conditions still favor the upside. However, to sustain the ongoing recovery, XRP price has to first hold the support at $2.20 and then overcome the resistance between $2.80 and $3.00. Several analysts remain optimistic about the altcoin’s ability to rebound to all-time highs, with popular trader Dark Defender saying that the ongoing correction is part of an Elliott Wave pattern that will eventually see “XRP continue its climb to the top.” Fellow trader Allincrypto believes XRP is “heading to $19.27” based on a breakout from a falling wedge pattern. “Where we are pulling back is textbook perfect, and we had highlighted a falling wedge that was present on XRP that ultimately was just going for a continuation to $19.27.” Related: What are XRP futures and how to invest in them? Approval odds for an XRP ETF approval in 2025 rise Bloomberg senior ETF analysts said that the five spot XRP ETFs, including Grayscale, 21Shares, WisdomTree, Bitwise, Canary, and Franklin Templeton, have an 85% chance of approval after the change in leadership at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This is a significant improvement from their prediction over two months ago that set the chances of an XRP approval in 2025 at 65%.

Over the past week, the probability of approval has swung 17% in favor of the bullish masses, which was around 63% on April 23. XRP ETF approval odds on Polymarket.

The approval of these ETFs could unlock institutional capital, amplifying demand for the XRP. While approval timelines remain unclear, they would mark a step toward mainstream adoption for XRP.

Bitcoin Seoul 2025 , Asia’s largest Bitcoin-focused conference, will take place from June 4 to 6, 2025, at two of Seoul’s most iconic venues: Signiel Seoul and SKY31 Convention. Following its successful debut in 2024, Bitcoin Seoul quickly established itself as a key fixture in the global Bitcoin conference circuit. The inaugural event featured leading Bitcoin thinkers such as Saifedean Ammous and Jimmy Song, and attracted thousands of industry professionals and community members to Seoul to exchange insights on Bitcoin’s evolution and future. Building on this momentum, the 2025 edition promises an expanded scale and a deeper examination of Bitcoin’s global trajectory. More than just a conference, Bitcoin Seoul 2025 will feature a multidimensional program spanning Bitcoin strategy, regulation, finance, policy, and real-world adoption. Amid the growing trend of publicly listed companies in Asia and Europe adopting Bitcoin as a treasury asset, executives who have led these initiatives—including from MetaPlanet and The Blockchain Group—will be participating in the event to share first-hand experiences from the corporate frontlines. Additionally, Dennis Porter, who spearheaded the Bitcoin strategic reserve movement in the United States, will offer insights into Bitcoin’s expanding adoption at the corporate and governmental levels. Highlighting real-world adoption El Salvador’s Mi Primer Bitcoin and Bitcoin Beach—trailblazers in national Bitcoin integration—will lead a special session titled “El Salvador Bitcoin Adoption Showcase.” The event will also welcome Bitcoin community leaders from around the world, including the United States, Australia, Hong Kong, Vietnam, and Indonesia, who will share firsthand experiences of community-driven Bitcoin adoption across different continents and regions. The 2025 program will feature: Bitcoin Policy Summit: Seoul Edition — Insights into regulatory trends and Bitcoin-related public policy Bitcoin Finance Forum — addressing institutional investment, Bitcoin treasury management, and macroeconomic perspectives; Global Bitcoin Community Assembly — A global forum for Bitcoin grassroots and community leaders In addition, attendees will be able to experience live Lightning Network payments at the on-site Lightning Market, showcasing Bitcoin’s real-world utility. Event Structure: VIP Day (June 4): Exclusive sessions and a private reception for global executives and institutional participants Industry Day (June 5): Focused on enterprise use cases and strategic insights from publicly listed companies and institutional players. Public Day (June 6): Dedicated to Bitcoin finance, adoption stories, and infrastructure innovations, welcoming community members, builders, and enthusiasts. As institutional interest in Bitcoin accelerates following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States, Bitcoin Seoul 2025 positions Seoul as a key node in the emerging global Bitcoin finance ecosystem. Countries including South Korea, Japan, and Hong Kong are rapidly integrating Bitcoin-based financial products and treasury strategies — reflecting a broader shift in the global financial landscape. Bitcoin Seoul 2025 aims to capture this momentum and further elevate Seoul’s status as a leading hub for Bitcoin-driven innovation and dialogue. This year, dozens of domestic and international companies are slated to sponsor the event. Among them is Bithumb, one of Korea’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, recently ranked #1 in the Korea Exchange Brand Reputation Index, signaling strong market trust. Ryan, the organizer of Bitcoin Seoul, commented: “Bitcoin Seoul 2025 will unite the global Bitcoin community, extending far beyond Asia to connect innovators worldwide. We are committed to creating a forum that integrates Bitcoin policy, finance, adoption, and community development.” About Bitcoin Seoul Bitcoin Seoul is the largest Bitcoin-only conference in Asia and serves as a central hub connecting the global and Asian Bitcoin ecosystems.

The analyst also revealed the price targets that DOGE could reach following this breakout. Dogecoin Price Poised For Breakout Above $0.17 In a TradingView post, Cryptokijker predicted that the Dogecoin price is poised for a breakout above $0.1790. The analyst revealed that the targets on this potential breakout are $0.1840 and $0.1920. He noted that the price at this level is showing a neutral-bullish structure after the recent breakout above the Previous Day Low (PDL). Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Dogecoin Is Repeating History – Here’s What Happened The analyst also highlighted a hidden bullish divergence spotted on the Relative Strength Index (RSI), indicating strength beneath the surface. This Dogecoin price prediction comes amid a massive accumulation of DOGE by whales. He noted that smart money has been accumulating heavily within the discount zone between $0.15 and $0.16, which supports this bullish bias. The analyst observed that the break of structure on the chart signals the start of a markup phase. He further remarked that the volume profile supports the accumulation-to-expansion transition. Meanwhile, the strong support confirmed at the $0.1760 zone aligns with previous discount accumulation, and the momentum building above the PDL suggests that the Dogecoin price could sustain this bullish momentum. Market participants will also be watching the psychological $0.2 level for the Dogecoin price on this potential breakout. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed that DOGE could rally towards its all-time high (ATH) if it can secure a monthly close above $0.20. The analyst remarked that such a breakout would signal strong bullish momentum and potentially attract increased investor interest. It is worth mentioning that crypto analyst Master Kenobi also recently predicted that the Dogecoin price could reach a new ATH by June. He stated that the foremost meme coin could hit as high as $0.9 on the rally to a new ATH. Other Factors That Support A DOGE Breakout Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade stated that a Dogecoin price breakout is expected soon, which will send the meme coin higher. This came as he noted that DOGE has been moving between different ranges, experiencing both false breakdowns and breakouts. The analyst added that the meme coin has now returned to its current range, setting the stage for a price breakout.

Technical forecasts suggest a breakout past the $2.40–$2.45 range could send XRP toward $3.63 or beyond. Sei: Quiet Progress Could Pay Off Sei remains a low-cap Layer 1 chain with rising developer engagement. The platform is focused on high-speed trading and low-latency infrastructure—two major selling points for future DeFi ecosystems. While there’s no major update this week, continued development behind the scenes and low market saturation could position Sei for a surprise move as altcoin sentiment builds. Solana: ETF Approval Sparks Surge Solana (SOL) closed April with a 41% monthly gain, currently hovering between $145 and $150. A critical resistance level at $180 remains in focus. If broken, analysts forecast a jump to $221. What’s driving this momentum? Canada’s historic approval of a spot SOL ETF , which has increased institutional exposure and attracted long-term holders. With altseason narratives picking up, Solana could lead the charge. CLAIM YOUR POSITION — ROI TARGET: 5000%+ Optimism: Under the Radar with Upside Optimism (OP) , With continued development and rising transaction volumes across L2 platforms, Optimism could benefit from ecosystem-wide gains. Investors looking for high-upside infrastructure plays are still keeping OP on the radar. Why MAGACOINFINANCE Could Define This Cycle Amid these headline-grabbing projects, one altcoin is quietly gaining momentum from the ground up— MAGACOINFINANCE . What sets it apart? Community-led traction, strategic timing, and a capped token supply that drives early demand. Investors are quickly catching on, securing allocations while it remains in its earliest phase. As interest grows and visibility spreads across social platforms, MAGACOINFINANCE is being positioned as a serious altcoin contender for 2025. This isn’t just a trend—it’s a long-term entry window that serious investors are watching closely. In conclusion, XRP , Sei , Solana , and Optimism all present timely opportunities with catalysts that could align well with 2025’s broader growth narrative.

Bitcoin Seoul 2025 , Asia’s largest Bitcoin-focused conference, will take place from June 4 to 6, 2025, at two of Seoul’s most iconic venues: Signiel Seoul and SKY31 Convention. Following its successful debut in 2024, Bitcoin Seoul quickly established itself as a key fixture in the global Bitcoin conference circuit. The inaugural event featured leading Bitcoin thinkers such as Saifedean Ammous and Jimmy Song, and attracted thousands of industry professionals and community members to Seoul to exchange insights on Bitcoin’s evolution and future. Building on this momentum, the 2025 edition promises an expanded scale and a deeper examination of Bitcoin’s global trajectory. More than just a conference, Bitcoin Seoul 2025 will feature a multidimensional program spanning Bitcoin strategy, regulation, finance, policy, and real-world adoption. Amid the growing trend of publicly listed companies in Asia and Europe adopting Bitcoin as a treasury asset, executives who have led these initiatives—including from MetaPlanet and The Blockchain Group—will be participating in the event to share first-hand experiences from the corporate frontlines. Additionally, Dennis Porter, who spearheaded the Bitcoin strategic reserve movement in the United States, will offer insights into Bitcoin’s expanding adoption at the corporate and governmental levels.

Remember hearing whispers about Arbitrum when it was just a concept, only to watch it climb to a multi-billion-dollar valuation while your portfolio stayed stuck? That kind of regret doesn’t just sting — it lingers. If you’re tired of being the one reading headlines after the winners have been crowned, this month could finally be your reset button. Right now, the best cryptos to buy this month aren’t about FOMO-driven hype. They’re about recognizing real utility, innovation, and projects that are still accessible before the doors slam shut. That’s where Qubetics ($TICS) steps in. Its presale is already a magnet for smart early adopters who see what’s coming. With the Qubetics presale crossing over $16.5 million raised, 510 million tokens sold, and over 25,500 token holders locking in their spots, the opportunity is screaming for attention. If you ever wanted to be early and right, it’s right here — but you have to act before the next stage hikes the price again. Missed the Earliest Wins? Qubetics Is Still One of the Best Cryptos to Buy This Month You know that gut punch when you realize you could have grabbed something at rock bottom but froze? That’s exactly what early community members of Qubetics are feeling good about right now. Those who locked $TICS during the whitelist phase got them at $0.01 when the presale kicked off quietly on September 29, 2024. Since then, the train hasn’t just left the station — it’s already hitting milestone after milestone. Multiple lower stages are long gone, but the best part? This best cryptos to buy this month opportunity isn’t out of reach yet. With the 32nd stage live and a price of $0.2093, you can still slide in before the next 10% price hike that hits after every seven days. Plus, there’s even a 10% discount available if you act now — talk about stacking advantages. A $1,000 investment at today’s price would give you approximately 4,778 $TICS. If Qubetics hits $1 after the presale, that’s $4,778 straight into your portfolio — a clean 377.76% ROI. But that’s just the conservative view. If $TICS climbs to $5, you’re staring down 2,288.80% gains. At $6, that’s 2,766.55%. Stretch it to $10 by mainnet launch? Now you’re in 4,677.59% ROI territory. And if $TICS hits $15? You’re sitting on a jaw-dropping 7,066.39% ROI. The Qubetics presale isn’t just a ticket to a token — it’s a shot at serious rewards. Beyond the numbers, what makes Qubetics irresistible is its real-world application, especially the QubeQode IDE. No coding background? No problem. QubeQode brings drag-and-drop blockchain functionality that startups, businesses, and even side hustlers can tap into easily. Imagine a fitness app that rewards users with tokens for milestones, or a small e-commerce brand launching loyalty points without hiring a dev team. Even a non-profit could build secure donor tracking with zero blockchain coding knowledge. It’s the kind of tech that bridges real-world need with blockchain power — making Qubetics not just another hype project but a real utility machine. That’s why those who are serious about catching the best cryptos to buy this month are locking in before Qubetics mainnet goes live in Q2 2025. Arbitrum Proved What Happens When You Bet on Real Tech When Arbitrum first dropped into the crypto space, hardly anyone outside the niche DeFi circles gave it a second look. But its early ICO believers secured it at a humble valuation, and then watched it explode as Arbitrum became the de facto Layer 2 leader on Ethereum. Those early-stage buys turned into some of the juiciest returns across the whole market. Arbitrum’s growth wasn’t luck; it was about delivering true scalability solutions at a time when Ethereum congestion and gas fees were pushing users away. It showed that when utility matches timing, massive growth is inevitable. Fast forward to today, Arbitrum is now a staple name across Web3. Its contribution to solving Ethereum’s Layer 1 bottlenecks has made it a key player, partnering across ecosystems and securing its spot among the market’s heavyweights. The wild part? Most people only woke up to Arbitrum after it had already printed its biggest gains. That’s the lesson here — getting in early on real innovation isn’t optional if you want life-changing returns. It’s about recognizing patterns before they become headlines. Don’t Miss Another Shot at a Breakout — Why Qubetics Is One of the Best Cryptos to Buy This Month If you’ve ever wanted to erase past regrets and actually move smartly, this is your moment. Qubetics checks every box: real-world application, strong community support, aggressive innovation roadmap, and the kind of presale figures that scream future potential. Early participants are already sitting on massive ROI projections even before the mainnet goes live, and the runway ahead is packed with catalysts. The best cryptos to buy this month aren’t the ones already sitting at billion-dollar valuations — they’re the ones like Qubetics, which are still affordable but loaded with upside. Every week you wait means a new price hike and fewer opportunities to maximize returns. If you’re looking to get ahead, now’s the time to join this best crypto presale and set yourself up before another breakout story passes you by.

Since 2021, nearly 7 million cryptocurrencies have been listed on CoinGecko’s token tracking tool GeckoTerminal, and over half, or 3.7 million tokens, “have since stopped trading and are considered failed,” CoinGecko research analyst Shaun Paul Lee said in an April 30 report . “Alarmingly, the first quarter of 2025 alone saw the collapse of 1.8 million tokens,” he added, which is “the highest number of failures recorded in a single year.” It also comprises just under half of all failures and represents a quarter of all tokens launched since 2021. CoinGecko recorded tokens with at least one trade before going defunct and only Pump.fun tokens that graduated, or completed the token creation platform’s bonding curve. There are more crypto tokens than ever, but many are failing to survive in the long term. Source: CoinGecko Lee linked the recent token die-off to “broader market turbulence” after Donald Trump’s inauguration in January, which saw Bitcoin ( BTC ) hit a peak high but was followed by a sharp downturn in the crypto market. More crypto tokens used to survive Last year saw the second-highest number of token failures at 1.3 million, and in comparison, Lee said that the three previous years had a much lower attrition rate. Lee attributed the ballooning number of tokens and their failures to the token creation tool Pump.fun, “which simplified the process of creating tokens, leading to a flood of memecoins and low-effort projects entering the market.” Pump.fun went online in January 2024. CoinGecko’s report shows that last year had the largest number of new crypto tokens with over 3 million launched, compared to 2023, which saw just over 835,000. “Before the launch of Pump.fun in 2024, cryptocurrency failures numbered in the low six digits. Project failures between 2021 and 2023 made up just 12.6% of all cryptocurrency failures over the past five years,” Lee said. Prior to 2024, crypto token failure rates were relatively low. Source: CoinGecko Pump.fun’s graduation rate, where token trading moves off the site, has never been particularly high , with roughly 98% of tokens failing. The platform’s best-performing week so far was in November 2024, when 1.67% of memecoins moved on to the open market. Related: AI tokens, memecoins dominate crypto narratives in Q1 2025: CoinGecko CoinGecko founder Bobby Ong said in a March 6 report that memecoin investor interest appears to have cooled after a series of bad launches, noting the fallout from the Libra (LIBRA) token launch. Pump.fun had a weekly trading volume high after the launch of Trump’s memecoin on Jan. 18, but both crypto and stock markets were hit with extreme volatility starting in March following Trump’s threats of sweeping tariffs.

Investors are closely monitoring Cardano (ADA) , Sei (SEI) , and Aave (AAVE) , each demonstrating significant momentum. Meanwhile, MAGACOINFINANCE is emerging as a noteworthy contender in the early-stage crypto space. For those considering an investment of $9,430, these assets present compelling opportunities.​ Cardano (ADA): Approaching the $1 Milestone Cardano is currently trading around $0.99 , marking a 12% increase over the past week. This surge is partly attributed to a substantial $20 million ADA withdrawal from exchanges on April 24, a move often seen as a bullish indicator. Analysts suggest that ADA could reach $3 to $4 between March and May 2025, driven by market cycles and decreasing supply. ​ Sei (SEI): Steady Growth with Promising Projections Sei is trading at approximately $0.213 , with forecasts predicting a rise to $0.232 by April 30, 2025. The platform’s recent developments, including a V2 upgrade and enhanced user experience through account abstraction, are contributing to its positive outlook. Projections suggest that SEI could reach a maximum of $2.865 before the end of 2025. ​ CLAIM YOUR POSITION — ROI TARGET: 5000%+ MAGACOINFINANCE: Emerging as a Promising Contender While established altcoins continue their ascent, MAGACOINFINANCE is quietly becoming one of the most discussed early-stage projects in the space. Backed by a growing community and expanding exposure, MAGACOINFINANCE is carving out a unique niche that many investors believe could define the next cycle of innovation.​ Investors acting now can access an exclusive 50% bonus offer. This limited-time promotion allows early buyers to significantly boost their holdings and maximize potential upside. Use promo code MAGA50X during checkout to activate the bonus and secure a larger share ahead of the listing wave.​ Aave (AAVE): Strengthening Position in DeFi Aave is currently priced at $165.99 , testing a critical resistance level. A successful breakout could propel the price towards $224 . The platform has achieved a record $35 billion in net deposits , indicating growing confidence in its DeFi offerings. Additionally, Aave has initiated a $50 million buyback program , aiming to boost token demand and support price growth. Final Thoughts With Cardano , Sei , and Aave showing strong performance and MAGACOINFINANCE emerging as a promising early-stage project, a $9,430 investment could yield substantial returns.

This happened as sales fell, profit collapsed, and investors lost patience with Elon’s obsession with the White House. Board members contacted many top recruiting firms to begin the official search for a new CEO, according to The Wall Street Journal . Meetings were held behind the scenes. At one of them, directors told Elon he had to spend more time at Tesla , and that he should say so publicly. Elon didn’t argue. The company had just posted a 71% plunge in first-quarter profit. Elon told shareholders on the earnings call, “Starting next month, I’ll be allocating far more of my time to Tesla.” Days later, President Donald Trump thanked Elon during a cabinet meeting. “You know you’re invited to stay as long as you want,” Trump said. “I guess he wants to get back home to his cars.” Elon’s absence triggered leadership crisis inside Tesla No one knows if Elon was aware of the CEO search or whether his promise to return to Tesla made a difference. But some board members already picked a search firm. Elon didn’t respond to questions. The company hasn’t shared anything publicly. If a new CEO is named, it would be the end of Elon’s two-decade reign running the electric car maker. He gave up the chairman seat in 2018 but stayed in charge of everything else. The eight-person board also wants to add a new independent director. JB Straubel, the company’s co-founder, has been meeting big investors to convince them that Tesla isn’t collapsing. But Elon’s political shift came at the worst time. In 2024, Tesla’s car sales dropped for the first time in more than ten years. Price cuts destroyed profit margins. The Cybertruck rollout was a disaster. It became a joke on late-night shows for its design. President Trump with Elon Musk at the White House to talk up the company’s vehicles in March. Source: WSJ After Trump won re-election, Tesla’s value shot up to $1.5 trillion. Then it crashed to $900 billion. Elon texted someone last year that he was tired of nonstop work, especially after a Delaware judge rejected his huge pay deal. He reportedly said he didn’t want to be CEO anymore, but he was scared nobody else could push Tesla’s idea that it wasn’t just a car company but the future of automation and robotics. Elon also complained that even though he owns 13% of Tesla, he hasn’t been paid in seven years. The board made a new compensation committee to deal with that. More than 20 execs report directly to him, based on company records. Since the election, he’s mostly lived in D.C. and spent weekends at Mar-a-Lago. When he did talk to his staff, it was remote. Employees said the first time they saw him in months was at a March meeting streamed live. Tesla investors question leadership as product issues mount At first, employees were glad Elon was away because they said he micromanaged too much, per the Journal’s report . But things changed fast. Some workers wanted confirmation that Elon still believed in Tesla’s mission. In November, Mike Snyder, who leads the solar and energy team, told his staff, “It’s obviously been a turbulent and emotional season, I acknowledge that. I’d rather have Elon next to Trump than an enemy of Trump.” He told them Elon still responded to messages. “People concerned that Elon is not engaged or interested, I can assure you that’s not true.” Executives also reportedly say Tesla is now focused on artificial intelligence and robots. The company is pivoting away from its old growth model. The new Cybercab has no pedals or wheel. The Optimus robot is the center of Elon’s next pitch: a $30 trillion company. But the core EV business is falling apart. Instead of rolling out a low-cost model this year, Tesla made cheaper versions of existing ones. The Model Y got a facelift in March. Meanwhile, the company is telling investors that self-driving ride services are coming soon. Tesla plans to launch its ride-hailing app in Austin by June. Customers will be able to take driverless rides in Model Ys. That puts them up against Waymo and Zoox. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

It was priced at only $0.007125 during the presale. The project has raised more than $19.6 million in funding already. It shows that investors are becoming more and more interested. It is expected that the project will surge as much as 50% at the time of listing. Hence, a lot of investors are looking ta it as a golden opportunity to get explosive gains. Speculative plays tend to be more risky, such as memecoins like Dogecoin. However, Lightchain AI has a proper roadmap at its back. It also has increasing community support, which means that it is a more serious project that is more likely to continue building. Big whales are already loading up on the supply quietly and retail investors still have time to get in before Lightchain AI becomes a breakout success story. XRP Whale Movements Signal Growing Interest in Lightchain AI XRP whales have been becoming more and more interested in Lightchain AI (LCAI) . It is an emerging blockchain project that integrates artificial intelligence. LCAI has already raised more than $19.6 million in its presale. Initially, the tokens were available at a price of $0.00712. As a result of this, they attracted a lot of attention from investors. In fact, ETH whales are already holding over 5% of Lightchain AI supply. Lightchain AI is different from other projects as it follows a unique Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism. This means that nodes get rewarded for executing AI computations, and its Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) allows efficient AI tasks on the blockchain. Additionally, its deflationary tokenomics model, which burns a portion of tokens during transactions, creates scarcity that could enhance token value over time. XRP is continuing to build in the cross-border payments space. However, since whales are becoming increasingly interested in Lightchain AI , it shows that the trend is shifting to blockchain projects that offer actual real-world utility and innovative solutions. Why Lightchain AI at $0.007 is Chance You Shouldn’t Miss With its presale price of $0.007, Lightchain AI is a force to be reckoned with in the world of cryptocurrency by now. Tapcore has already received millions of dollars in funding and is now making a stir with its unique mix of blockchain and artificial intelligence. Developed with advanced scalability technology such as Sharding and Layer 2 solutions, Lightchain AI seeks to go beyond the limitations of current blockchain-based systems, delivering increased speed, efficiency, and automation enabled by artificial intelligence (AI). Lightchain AI’s Anticipated 50% Listing Surge– Market’s Next Game-Changer! Lightchain AI is positioned for a significant 50% price increase, solidifying its status as an emerging market disruptor. The successful presale fundraising of $19.6 million highlights strong market confidence in Lightchain AI’s long-term potential. With its listing on major exchanges approaching, this may be the final opportunity for investors to secure a position at a lower price before the anticipated growth. Notably, interest from XRP whales further strengthens Lightchain AI’s market presence, reinforcing its positioning as a key player in the blockchain space. Now is a strategic time to consider an investment in Lightchain AI . With its innovative AI-powered blockchain platform, this project is on track to become a major success story by 2025. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf Tweets by LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-01 03:00:00

Now, the search for the next explosive opportunity has intensified across the crypto space. However, a new altcoin powerhouse called RCO Finance has investors excited. Backed by a $7.5 million VC injection, RCOF is the go-to project for those looking beyond the Solana price and seeking early entry into the next major crypto breakout. While the Solana Price Consolidates, RCOF Steals the Spotlight with Explosive Growth The Solana price is down by 2.38% to $149.08 in the last 24 hours, and traders have begun looking for alternatives. Many analysts have predicted that the price might hit $200 in the long term. However, better opportunities with higher upside potential are emerging elsewhere. RCOF is now gaining serious recognition from institutions, and this crypto asset is fast becoming a household name. Smart traders know that the best way to ride massive gains is to follow institutional capital because when they move, the entire market follows. With over 200,000 members already joining the RCOF ecosystem and big money flowing in, retail investors are starting to realize the window of opportunity is closing. As the Solana price continues to dip, RCOF is setting up to create the next wave of crypto millionaires. Why Excitement Around RCOF Is At An All-Time High RCO Finance has made a powerful entrance into the crypto market, securing a $7.5 million injection from venture capitalists, an early signal of the project’s massive potential. But this is only the beginning. In just a matter of weeks, RCO has attracted over 200,000 users, sending shockwaves across the crypto space. The rapid adoption has left even established players like Solana struggling to keep pace, as investors rush to secure a position before the next major breakout. Even a future Solana price uptrend can not match RCOF’s potential at this point. For those still watching from the sidelines, this is precisely the problem. Since Stage 1, RCOF has already surged by 1,300%, fueled by growing investor confidence and the recent $7.5 million capital injection. And this may just be the prelude. Analysts are now projecting a potential 30,000% rally in the coming weeks as momentum accelerates and early backers double down on their positions. For savvy investors who already own RCOF tokens, there is still a huge chance to profit even more. The internal team has RCOF hitting $1 by the end of Q2, but many analysts argue this projection is overly modest given the project’s recent developments. With momentum building rapidly and investor sentiment turning overwhelmingly bullish, RCOF could be on track to far exceed current expectations. New Features Set to Drive RCOF’s Token Price Further RCO Finance is rapidly evolving into a full-suite investment platform, beginning with the launch of its AI-powered dashboard. This groundbreaking interface offers real-time analytics, smart portfolio insights, and dynamic visualizations, setting the stage for personalized AI guidance via Intel AI Chat. Building on that foundation, RCOF introduced Smart Portfolio Management, an AI-enhanced tool that breaks down asset allocations, market values, and growth trends in a visually compelling way. Investors can now track their portfolio health in real time across devices, gaining deeper insight into performance with highly interactive data visualization. To complete the experience, RCO Finance expanded into Multi-Asset Class Support and Custom Watchlists, giving users access to live data across crypto, stocks, bonds, FX, ETFs, and more. Interactive candlestick charts and live tickers provide full market transparency, while personalized Watchlists make it easy to track and respond to market movements. Now, beyond words, here’s what’s in it for everyday investors. The $7.5 million VC injection is proof that institutional money is now flowing into RCOF, and smart money never shows up late. At its current price point, this may be the last window before a major price breakout sends RCOF into a price range too high for everyday investors. Luckily for you, institutional interest is only just beginning, creating a small window of opportunity for investors looking to make it big in 2025.

The CCI’s Proof of Stake Alliance (POSA) group argued in an April 30 letter to the agency’s Crypto Task Force lead, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, that staking is fundamentally a technical process, not an investment activity. “Staking isn’t niche — it’s the backbone of the decentralized internet,” the letter said. The letter responded to the SEC’s call for public input on whether staking and liquid staking, where crypto users lock up their tokens to earn more, should be regulated under federal securities laws. The coalition called for the SEC to support responsible inclusion of staking features in exchange-traded products (ETPs), and “avoid overly prescriptive rules that could freeze market structures and stifle innovation in the staking space.” The group argued that staking fails to meet the securities-defining Howey test definition of an “investment contract” as stakers retain ownership of their assets. Source: Crypto Council for Innovation They added that blockchain protocols, not a staking provider's efforts, determine rewards, and providers don’t deliver profits through managerial decisions like a company does. The letter requested that the SEC Issue principles-based guidance similar to recent SEC staff statements on proof-of-work mining. “In the past 4 months, we’ve seen more movement and constructive dialogue with the SEC than in the past 4 years,” the group said. “Now, the industry is stepping up with concrete principles to include in guidance — a reflection of this new collaborative approach.” Related: Ethereum ETF staking will have little impact without multimonth rally: Analyst The group argued that the existing securities disclosure regime is ill-suited for staking services, which are fundamentally technical rather than financial in nature. Big names in support of staking clarity The Proof of Stake Alliance includes several high-profile crypto organizations and companies, including the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), blockchain software firm Consensys, and the crypto exchange Kraken, which restored staking services in the US earlier this year. The SEC has yet to approve a crypto staking exchange-traded fund (ETF) and delayed the decision on allowing staking for Grayscale’s spot Ether ETF on April 14. In April, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart predicted that an Ether ETF that includes staking could come as soon as May .

After a modest recovery in recent weeks, ETH—along with the broader crypto market—is facing a critical resistance zone that could either spark a breakout rally or lead to deeper consolidation. Bulls must break through the $1,850–$2,000 region to confirm renewed momentum, but macroeconomic headwinds are making that task more difficult. Related Reading: Chainlink Flashes Daily Buy Signal – Breakout Next? Persistent uncertainty surrounding US-China trade tensions and global economic slowdowns continues to weigh on investor sentiment. While risk assets have shown signs of resilience, the environment remains volatile and sensitive to geopolitical developments. Within this context, large holders appear to be taking a cautious approach. According to data from CryptoQuant, whales took advantage of Ethereum’s recent price surge, offloading 262,000 ETH—worth approximately $445 million—over the past several days. This significant wave of selling suggests profit-taking activity from major players, which could temporarily cap upside potential. If the market fails to absorb this supply efficiently, further pressure could follow. Ethereum at a Crossroads As Whale Activity Sparks Caution Ethereum continues to struggle in reclaiming bullish momentum after losing over 55% of its value from the December highs. Despite recent attempts at recovery, ETH remains under pressure and trades below critical resistance levels, keeping the broader market cautious. Currently hovering just above the $1,800 mark, Ethereum is testing a pivotal zone that could shape its short-term trajectory. On lower time frames, ETH is beginning to form a more constructive structure, suggesting that bullish momentum may be building. Bulls are aiming to reclaim key supply zones between $1,850 and $2,000, a move that would mark a shift in market dynamics. However, heavy selling pressure still looms. Analysts are watching closely to see if Ethereum can sustain higher lows and push toward breakout levels. Yet, not everyone is convinced of a bullish continuation. Top analyst Ali Martinez recently shared data showing that whales sold approximately 262,000 ETH—worth nearly $445 million—during the latest price surge. This selloff implies that larger players may be preparing for increased volatility or a potential pullback, which could stall any short-term rally attempts. If Ethereum fails to push above immediate resistance and absorb ongoing selling pressure, it risks falling back into lower demand zones between $1,500 and $1,600. For now, holding above $1,750 is essential to keep the bullish scenario alive. With macroeconomic uncertainty and market-wide indecision still in play, Ethereum remains in a delicate balance—poised either for a significant breakout or a renewed correction. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates Against Bitcoin – Dominance Shift On The Horizon? Ethereum Price Tests Patience as Tight Range Persists Ethereum is currently trading at $1,810, caught in a narrow band between $1,850 and $1,750. This tight consolidation has lasted for several days, and the market is now awaiting a decisive breakout to set the tone for the next major move. Bulls must reclaim higher levels to confirm a breakout and validate the recent momentum shift that began earlier this month. The $1,850 resistance has capped recent attempts to move higher, and each rejection near this level adds pressure. A confirmed breakout above this level would likely trigger increased buying activity, pushing ETH toward the critical $2,000–$2,100 supply zone. This range remains the key area for bulls to reclaim in order to establish a strong uptrend and shift broader sentiment. However, the risk of rejection remains. If ETH fails to break above $1,850 or sustains a fakeout, a correction toward the lower end of the range is expected. A decisive breakdown below $1,750 could trigger a deeper retrace, targeting support near $1,600 or lower. Related Reading: Solana Forms Textbook Cup And Handle Pattern – Massive Breakout Ahead?

At the time of writing, XRP is down by more than 2% and is trading at $2.20. Wave Structure and Support Levels The ongoing pullback is interpreted as part of a larger wave 4 correction. From this zone, a further upward move is possible, with chances for XRP to form another higher high. However, a deeper retracement cannot be excluded. In the event of another leg down, support between $1.22 and $1.34 would become the next area to watch. The $1.21 level remains pivotal. A break below this point would significantly weaken the bullish case, suggesting a shift toward a more bearish outlook. Bullish Prospects and Price Targets As long as XRP holds above the current upper support levels, the potential for an upward breakout remains on the table. Possible targets in this scenario include $5.00, $5.65, and even $6.60. While speculative discussions have pointed to the possibility of XRP reaching $10 or more, such projections are considered low-probability outliers without clear structural support at this stage. Any extended fifth wave would be unusual and would require strong confirmation. Short-Term Outlook XRP has undergone a retracement, with the current price structure appearing unclear and choppy. The recent move up may represent the beginning of a diagonal pattern, following a possible wave 4 low in April. A minor B-wave correction around April 20 was shallow and may not provide enough structure to confirm the next leg upward. Currently, the price has recovered to approximately $2.16, after briefly dipping below weaker Fibonacci-based support. The more important level to monitor in the short term is $2.12. As long as this level holds, the chances remain for a continuation of the bullish pattern. A break below $2.12 could lead to a reset of the current wave count and signal a larger flat correction.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-01 03:31:28

The bill, called the Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025, would force huge economic consequences if president Vladimir Putin keeps ignoring peace talks or invades Ukraine again. According to The Wall Street Journal , Graham said on Wednesday the bill already has over 60 co-sponsors, which clears the filibuster barrier in the Senate. He expects at least 67 backers by the end of the week, which would be enough to override a veto from Trump if that ever became necessary. The support comes from both parties. It includes Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who joined without promising a floor vote. Also on board is Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Graham said the growing list should send a clear message to the White House and to Russia that the Senate is ready to act if peace talks collapse. “I let him know what we’re doing,” Graham said about Trump. “And I’m not going to speak for the president, but I will say that I hope he’s successful. I am somewhat optimistic we can get there. But we can’t let this go on forever.” Graham responds to stalled peace efforts with sanctions The timing of Graham’s move lines up with Trump’s stalled effort to stop the war in Ukraine, which began when Russia launched its full invasion in 2022. Ukraine had offered a 30-day cease-fire in March if Russia agreed, but Putin refused. Instead, he proposed a short pause in fighting between May 8 and May 10, during Russia’s annual parade honoring the end of World War II. Trump said earlier this month that Putin may be dragging him along and has no intention of stopping the war. Graham backed that thought. “It’s clear to me, and I think it’s becoming clear to President Trump, that the Russians are playing games,” he said . Even though Trump has talked about possible sanctions before, he hasn’t taken solid action. Graham teamed up with Senator Richard Blumenthal to introduce the bill earlier in April. It imposes both primary and secondary sanctions on Russia and any government supporting the war in Ukraine. It also slaps a 500% tariff on goods from countries still buying Russian oil, gas, or uranium. Graham’s office said the tariff part of the bill would hit China, India, and Iran the hardest. Taylor Reidy, his spokesperson, said it might also impact some European allies, but discussions with officials from Germany, France, Poland, and the U.K. showed they agreed it was time to take sides. Graham says bill pressure grew after new Russian attacks Although some European countries have reduced dependence on Russian energy, the EU reported that in 2024, Russia still supplied 17% of gas and 18% of liquefied natural gas imports. Graham called the sanctions in the bill “bone crushing.” He said if Putin doesn’t agree to a negotiated peace soon, the Senate will respond aggressively. “Unless there is a negotiated peace soon, I’m confident the Senate would move in overwhelming fashion to hit Russia hard.” He added that he’d rather see a diplomatic end, and said the bill gives Trump room to finish his talks. But he insisted the Senate is tired of waiting. “Most members of the Senate believe that Putin has been resistant to finding a negotiated solution to the war, and has been brazen and barbaric in his actions against Ukraine,” Graham said. “By co-sponsoring this bill I think a senator is making a pretty clear statement that they see Russia as the greatest offender here.” In the House, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick introduced a matching bill, which now has 26 co-sponsors, evenly split between Republicans and Democrats. Graham believes that if it gets a vote, it’ll pass easily. Blumenthal said, “This bill has legs, really strong legs.” He said he spoke directly with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky about it. Blumenthal said the bill sends a “bone-chilling message to Putin that Congress is steadfast and resolute behind the people of Ukraine.” When asked how long Congress would wait before moving, Graham said, “We’re talking weeks.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Weak token burns and rising exchange inflows indicate that the pullback may intensify in the short term. Hitting Another Target Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains one of the most popular crypto projects , which in recent years evolved from a meme coin to a complex ecosystem. One of its features is the layer-2 scaling solution Shibarium, which aims to reduce transaction fees, improve speed, and enhance scalability. It officially saw the light of day in August 2023 and has made serious progress since then. Approximately a month ago, the number of transactions processed on Shibarium exceeded one billion. The figure currently stands at over 1.12 billion. Earlier today (April 30), the protocol blasted through a new important milestone. Specifically, the total number of wallet addresses that have interacted with Shibarium since its launch surpassed 200 million. The L2 blockchain solution has garnered the attention of multiple industry participants in the past months, some of whom believe SHIB’s potential rally during this bull cycle depends heavily on it. An example is the popular Bitcoin advocate Jeremie Davinci, who said : “I like Shiba Inu, as you know, and I think it will do relatively well in this cycle, but it may not go as high as you expect. I think Shiba Inu has a lot of utility now that they have Shibarium, and basically, it’s a chain that you can actually run all kinds of applications. However, nobody is using it, and there are no applications for using your tokens on Shibarium yet. If they get that solved , Shiba Inu will go to the moon.” SHIB Price Outlook Despite Shibarium’s latest achievement, Shiba Inu remains in the red today, retreating by approximately 3% and currently trading at $0.00001323 (per CoinGecko’s data). Moreover, some factors suggest the pullback could deepen in the short term. For example, the token burn mechanism has removed only a small amount of SHIB over the past week. Its main purpose is to reduce the massive circulating supply, potentially increasing the token’s value through scarcity. However, demand must head north – or, at the very least, not decline for this to have a real impact. Shiba Inu’s exchange netflow is also worth observing.

Bitcoin (BTC) is holding steady near $94,880, while altcoins like LTC, XRP, AVAX, and LINK have recorded losses. As for Pi Coin, the altcoin has struggled since peaking near $3 in February, with its price action remaining largely bearish. Pi Coin has recorded a 12% monthly decline despite a few short-lived rebounds. Will Pi Coin Price Rise in May? However, as May approaches, there are signs that Pi Coin could be gearing up for a recovery. Pi is currently trading at $0.6249, showing a 7% rise, and with a market cap now over $4 billion. While the broader crypto market sentiment shows improvement, Pi’s rise is still being limited by the absence of key catalysts, such as major exchange listings or significant mainnet upgrades. evel. On the technical front, the RSI has steadily improved from its April lows, showing growing accumulation, although at a slower pace. Overall, traders appear cautiously optimistic about Pi Coin’s future, given its historic volatility and the relatively low liquidity on exchanges. Additionally, 7.8 million Pi tokens are set to be unlocked today, which could impact the price. Is $1.70 Incoming? Despite all these challenges, analysts like Dr. Altcoin believe that Pi Coin’s price could rise to $1.70 by mid-May. The expected price increase is based on upcoming events, particularly the Consensus Summit scheduled for May 14–16, where Dr. Nicholas Kokkalis, the founder of Pi Network, is expected to give a speech. Analyst Andrew Griffiths shared that Pi Coin is currently stuck between the bulls and bears around the 0.6 level. If the trend continues upwards and breaks above 0.75-0.78, it could reach 1. However, if the price drops below 0.55, it could signal a bearish trend, possibly heading towards 0.288.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|AVAX|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-01 03:44:15

The BoJ left its benchmark interest rate frozen at 0.5%, ignoring mounting pressure from worsening US trade policies. As a result, the yen lost as much as 0.3%, hitting 143.48 against the dollar and snapping a four-month winning streak. According to Bloomberg, the central bank also pushed back its inflation target timeline and said the risk to prices is now tilted to the downside. Officials described the future of global trade as “extremely uncertain,” with no indication of how long the current chaos might last. Trump’s new tariffs have already rattled markets and made traders ditch earlier bets on tighter policy. Source: Bloomberg Ueda offers no rate timeline while factory sentiment tanks All 54 economists polled by Bloomberg had predicted the BoJ wouldn’t budge. They were right. At the press conference, Governor Kazuo Ueda offered zero indication of any near-term rate hike. Markets that once showed full confidence in a move by year-end have now slashed that to just 50%, using overnight index swaps. The yen’s strength over the last few months has been driven by a mix of Trump’s trade war, weakening US assets, and a rush into so-called safe havens. Last week, the yen touched its highest level since September, but all that reversed fast. Speculative traders had been betting big, too, as net long positions on the yen hit a record high, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Behind the scenes, BoJ officials still believe a slow, steady approach is best. They’re holding off on further tightening until they can see more data on how Trump’s policies are hitting Japan’s economy. And those numbers are already looking ugly. Japan’s manufacturing PMI for April came in at 48.7, just barely better than March’s 48.4. That’s still under the 50-point line, meaning the sector is shrinking. This is now the tenth month in a row of contraction. Worse, new orders and exports are falling even faster, showing that demand is evaporating both at home and abroad. S&P Global reported that Japanese companies are now pulling back hard. They’re cutting purchases, adjusting inventories, and turning pessimistic about the future. Confidence in upcoming output is now at its lowest point since mid-2020, when the COVID crisis was still ripping through markets. S&P said that without major improvements in demand inside and outside Japan, “firms are likely to struggle to see a recovery in conditions.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

All are leveraging strong fundamentals, strategic narratives, and expanding ecosystems to drive investor confidence. Backed by bullish technicals and institutional momentum, these altcoins are poised to influence the direction of the market throughout Q2. Solana (SOL) Gains Traction From ETF Momentum Solana (SOL) is trading between $145 and $150 , riding on the back of a 41% price surge in April and continued interest heading into May. A key development— Canada’s approval of the world’s first spot SOL ETF —has shifted institutional sentiment toward Solana. If SOL can clear resistance at $180 , analysts project a rally toward $221 , signaling a return to its bullish trajectory. Beyond price, SOL’s developer ecosystem remains one of the fastest-growing in the sector, and long-term holder accumulation has continued to reinforce the bullish narrative. Polygon (MATIC) Benefits From Ethereum Strength Currently priced around $1.03 , Polygon (MATIC) remains one of the most reliable Ethereum Layer 2 solutions. As Ethereum maintains strong technical support and bullish forecasts for May, MATIC benefits directly from its integration and scalability role. Forecasts for MATIC’s 2025 performance are bullish, with potential highs exceeding $6.25 . With strong fundamentals and institutional interest in Layer 2 platforms increasing, MATIC continues to look undervalued at current levels. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST!

Nasdaq-listed crypto firms posted strong gains in April after a period of macroeconomic uncertainty. Galaxy CEO Mike Novogratz says the listing will broaden the company’s investor base and US presence. The Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) listed crypto investment firm Galaxy Digital is set to move to the US-based Nasdaq on May 16, pending stakeholder approval at its upcoming shareholders meeting. Galaxy’s planned move comes as several Nasdaq-listed crypto firms saw substantial gains in April, following a turbulent few months of macroeconomic uncertainty. Galaxy founder and CEO Mike Novogratz said on April 30 that the listing would be a milestone “that would position us to advance our vision of building a gateway for investors to safely and efficiently access every corner of the digital asset and artificial intelligence ecosystems.” Nasdaq listing will widen Galaxy’s investor base A special Galaxy shareholders' meeting is scheduled for May 9 to seek final approval for the move, with Nasdaq also needing to offer its approval before listing the crypto firm. The company plans to use the ticker symbol GLXY on the Nasdaq, and if it goes ahead with the listing, will enter a transition period during which it will continue to trade on the TSX, on which it first listed in July 2020. Galaxy is down 12.28% on the TSX so far this year amid a broader market downturn, according to Google Finance data. GLXY is own 12.28% since Jan. 1 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Source: Google Finance Meanwhile, the Nasdaq 100 is down 7.33% so far in 2025, according to TradingView data. However, it held steady in April, with some commentators downplaying the recent bearish sentiment. Novogratz is widely known as a pro-crypto advocate and Bitcoin ( BTC ) bull. It was reported on April 17 that Galaxy Ventures Fund I LP is expected to raise around $175 million to $180 million by the end of June to build a portfolio of 30 crypto and blockchain startups. Crypto entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano said in an April 30 X post that “the Nasdaq 100 ended April up more than 1%, and people are still talking about the Great Depression.” “Insane,” Pompliano added.

Recently, Dan Tapiero—founder of 10T Holdings and a long-time investor—shared his thoughts on XRP, praising its ability to survive in a tough and fast-changing industry. In an interview with CoinDesk, he said that, “One very impressive thing about XRP is just how long it’s lasted, how many times it’s come under attack. It’s the Lindy effect—the longer it exists, the stronger it becomes.” A History of Scrutiny and Survival XRP’s journey has been anything but smooth. Its parent company, Ripple Labs, has faced fierce criticism and legal challenges—including a high-profile lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that resulted in XRP being delisted from several major U.S. exchanges. For a time, it looked like XRP might fade into obscurity. But the token didn’t disappear. It bounced back. Despite detractors—particularly among Bitcoin maximalists and Ethereum loyalists—XRP has retained a passionate community and continued use cases. ETFs and the American Edge Recent chatter around ProShares launching XRP ETFs has sparked fresh interest, though it’s met with mixed reactions in the crypto community. Tapiero points out that while Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate headlines, XRP is carving out a unique identity—and doing so from U.S. soil. “It’s made in America. And with this administration, that matters,” he said. A Personal Connection Tapiero’s connection to XRP runs deep. His first crypto trades were in Bitcoin and XRP, executed via a platform then called BitReserve—now known as Uphold. His gold firm, Gold Bullion International (GBI), was the first to let users trade gold for XRP and Bitcoin. Back then, XRP traded at a tenth of a cent. Today, it fluctuates around $2.00 depending on market cycles. Looking back, Tapiero admits he didn’t fully understand XRP at the time and didn’t hold onto it long-term. But his takeaway is one many in the space can relate to: “Just because you didn’t buy it at a tenth of a cent doesn’t mean you couldn’t buy it at one cent, or ten cents. If you believe in something, never give up on it.”",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|FIAT|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-01 04:09:40

The surge in trading volumes, as investors looked to hedge their positions in a volatile market, helped the platform’s profits more than double, surpassing analysts’ expectations. The company’s transaction-based revenue, which includes income from options, crypto, and equities trading, shot up by 77% this quarter. A significant chunk of this came from crypto, which brought in $252m in revenue, marking a 100% jump from the same time last year. That figure slightly exceeded the $247m that analysts had predicted, underscoring the strength of Robinhood’s crypto business. Robinhood Markets has just released financial results for the first quarter of 2025.

Despite market volatility, crypto transactions remained strong, a trend that’s been crucial for Robinhood’s success. CEO Vlad Tenev said that while the company continues to rely on crypto volumes, it’s working to diversify beyond that. Over time, Robinhood plans to make the crypto side of its business less dependent on transaction volumes. “We’re focused on diversifying the business outside of crypto,” Tenev said during the earnings call . “This will make us less reliant on crypto transaction volumes in the future.” Image Source: Robinhood Strong Performance Across Options, Equities, and Margin Investments Fuel Robinhood’s Q1 Success But it wasn’t just crypto that fueled Robinhood’s success. The company also saw impressive growth in options and equities trading. Revenue from options jumped 56%, while equities grew by 44%. Net interest revenue, which mainly comes from margin investing, jumped 14% to $290m. Robinhood’s platform assets rose by 70% year-over-year, reaching $221b, with record net deposits of $18b. Tenev pointed out that customers are not only trading more, but they’re also entrusting Robinhood with more of their assets. The company’s net income for the quarter hit $336m, or 37 cents per share, compared to $157m, or 18 cents per share, last year. Analysts had forecasted a profit of 33 cents per share. This strong performance came despite the ongoing trade tensions between the US and China, which kept markets on edge. The first quarter was marked by significant swings in both stocks and crypto prices, largely due to President Donald Trump’s trade policies. While some markets have started to recover from the losses in April, the uncertainty continues, creating opportunities for platforms like Robinhood to succeed in the current volatile environment.

Those who decide to take the plunge and gaze into the orb will gain access to the World app and receive an airdrop of World’s WLD token. By the end of the year, the project aims to have enough orbs spread throughout the U.S. to give 180 million Americans, more than half the population, access to World’s network. Altman and other executives at World’s parent company Tools for Humanity announced the U.S. expansion at a press conference in San Francisco on Wednesday evening, along with a dizzying slew of new features and partnerships for the project. The World app will now offer its users access to crypto-backed loans through non-custodial lending protocol Morpho and prediction markets through Kalshi. Later this year, WLD holders will be able to spend their tokens like cash with a new World-linked Visa debit card. The project is even integrating its identity-verification technology into some online dating apps. Starting with Tinder users in Japan, online dating giant Match Group will pilot using World ID to verify the ages of its users. Altman said that the idea for World predated OpenAI, his generative artificial intelligence (AI) company. “We needed some sort of way for authenticating humans in the age of [artificial general intelligence],” Altman said during the press conference. “We needed a way that we could know what content was made by humans, [and what was made] by AI. We wanted a way to make sure that humans stayed special and central in a world where the internet was going to have lots of AI-driven content.” Altman’s initial ideas about how to solve the problem of human verification were “very crazy,” he said – World and its eye-scanning orbs, only a little. World is the latest crypto project to announce a U.S. expansion. Since President Donald Trump took office in January, the regulatory environment has become much friendlier to crypto projects. The company announced it would be building a factory in Richardson, Texas – a suburb of Dallas – to help produce the orbs needed for its coming U.S. expansion. After the initial rollout, other major cities including Seattle, Orlando, San Diego and Las Vegas will receive the second wave of orbs. “They will really be everywhere,” said Alex Blania, Tools for Humanity’s co-founder. “They will be in gas stations, convenience stores, and you will be able to verify within 10 minutes wherever you are.”",Tech|World Token|Sam Altman|Openai|News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|WLD|AIRDROP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-01 04:20:02

In a 9-6 ruling, the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia refused to lift a legal order that’s been blocking the Social Security Administration (SSA) from giving unrestricted access to DOGE, the government agency led by Elon Musk . Trump’s administration tried to push past that block, but the court told them no. This case started after US District Judge Ellen Lipton Hollander in Maryland issued an injunction on April 17, saying SSA most likely broke federal privacy laws by trying to hand over private data to DOGE without restrictions. Now, the appeals court has kept that injunction in place. The White House still wants access, and Liz Huston, Trump’s spokesperson, said in a statement that the president “will continue to seek all legal remedies available to ensure the will of the American people is executed.” Judges say DOGE overstepped with data grab Trump and Elon launched DOGE to wipe out what they call “government waste.” That includes cutting jobs, gutting federal departments, and cracking open databases. But this time, they ran into resistance. DOGE had already been cleared to access sensitive information at the Treasury, Education, and Office of Personnel Management, but now the line has been drawn at Social Security. Three separate plaintiffs – two labor unions and an advocacy group – sued DOGE, Elon, and SSA in February. They wanted DOGE banned from accessing SSA’s most secure internal systems. Those systems hold data on roughly 73 million Americans, including people who get retirement and disability benefits. Elon said the system is corrupt. He claimed that millions of dead Americans were still getting checks, even though that statement has no proof behind it. Trump echoed the same fraud claims, despite also saying he wouldn’t cut Social Security. But federal judges weren’t moved. Judge Robert King, who joined the majority in the 9–6 vote, made it clear in a written opinion that SSA was trusted with sensitive information and had failed to protect it. “This highly sensitive personal information has long been handed over to SSA by the American people with every reason to believe that the information would be fiercely protected,” King said. King added that trust was broken the moment DOGE was allowed into the system. Judge Hollander had already made it clear two weeks earlier that DOGE had no business digging around in those systems. The level of access DOGE received was higher than that of even SSA’s most senior staffers. King said the evidence was solid and the stakes were higher than anything DOGE had done before. “The case over Social Security data was substantially stronger,” he said. Judge Julius Richardson, one of the six who voted against keeping the injunction, said the court should’ve treated this case the same as DOGE’s previous data access at other departments. But Richardson got outvoted. The majority didn’t agree. They saw Social Security data as a different beast. DOGE is now being forced to back off. The ruling says the agency can’t access SSA’s data and also demands that DOGE delete any personally identifiable information it has already pulled from the SSA. That part is final unless Trump’s team gets the Supreme Court involved. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

XRP , Kaspa (KAS) , NEAR Protocol (NEAR) , and Injective (INJ) are each gaining attention for their unique roles in the ecosystem. But one project is beginning to capture long-term interest at a deeper level— MAGACOINFINANCE.COM , now viewed by some as a viable contender among high-visibility tokens. XRP Holds the Spotlight, but Others are Catching Up XRP is trading around $2.15 , up significantly in April with a strong weekly rally of over 10% . Fueling the surge is the approval of futures-based XRP ETFs in the U.S., with the ProShares fund launching this week. As institutional money flows in and CME prepares to launch its own XRP futures, attention is focused on whether XRP can break above resistance at $2.45 . Kaspa (KAS) is seeing renewed buying momentum. With an April average near $0.10 , forecasts point toward a possible rally to $0.317–$0.333 in May. Kaspa’s appeal lies in its unique blockDAG architecture, which continues to differentiate it from other proof-of-work coins. NEAR Protocol (NEAR) , though without major headlines this week, remains stable in price and continues to develop its scalable ecosystem. Developers and long-term holders remain committed, and technical indicators suggest NEAR could benefit from any Ethereum-led rally. Injective (INJ) , while also light on news, has retained strong community support and is positioned as a leading infrastructure protocol in decentralized trading. The project’s long-term development roadmap and integrations continue to fuel speculation of renewed upside heading into Q2. MAGACOINFINANCE – Strategic Growth With Long-Term Vision While the spotlight often falls on high-cap assets or short-term headlines, MAGACOINFINANCE is building something far more strategic. With a clear brand identity, rising community strength, and growing visibility, MAGACOINFINANCE is capturing the interest of traders looking for the next meaningful opportunity. MAGACOINFINANCE blends message, mission, and early-stage timing into a cohesive value proposition. It’s steadily gaining traction—supported not by hype alone, but by consistent growth, focused messaging, and ecosystem expansion. Savvy analysts forecast a developing movement with lasting potential in MAGACOINFINANCE. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Final Thoughts While XRP continues to dominate headlines with its institutional shift, altcoins like Kaspa , NEAR , and Injective are quietly gaining ground.

Companies of all sizes are eager to harness the power of AI, recognizing its potential for game-changing applications. However, turning exciting AI pilot projects into real-world production systems remains a significant hurdle for many enterprises. Revolutionizing IT Consulting with AI Enter Gruve.ai, a startup founded by the experienced team behind Rahi Systems, an IT solutions company acquired by Wesco for $225 million in 2022. Gruve aims to tackle the challenge of getting AI solutions out of the testing phase and into practical application. Their approach is unique: they use AI itself to deliver their consulting services. For decades, traditional IT consulting firms, including major players, have been the go-to partners for companies lacking in-house skilled staff to implement new technology. However, this human-centric model often comes with significant costs. As Tarun Raisoni, CEO of Gruve, told Bitcoin World, the technology services industry hasn’t seen significant disruption in 25 to 30 years, but AI is fundamentally changing that dynamic. Gruve plans to transform the traditional consulting model in two key ways: Leveraging AI Agents: Reducing the need for a large human consulting staff by employing AI agents to handle repetitive or standardized tasks. Usage-Based Pricing: Shifting from traditional hourly billing to charging clients based on their actual usage of the implemented AI solutions. Achieving Software-Like Margins Through AI Services Historically, venture capitalists have shown limited interest in IT services firms primarily because their reliance on human labor made scaling difficult and kept margins relatively low. By substituting human consultants with AI agents for specific tasks, Gruve can achieve software-like gross margins, potentially reaching 70% to 80%. This is significantly higher than the typical margins seen in traditional tech consulting businesses, according to Navin Chaddha, managing partner at Mayfield. This innovative model, combined with the team’s proven track record from building Rahi Systems, has attracted significant investment. Gruve recently raised a $20 million Series A funding round led by Mayfield, with participation from Cisco Investments and other investors. This brings Gruve’s total funding to $37.5 million, providing substantial capital to scale its AI-driven consulting approach. Delivering Enterprise AI Solutions Raisoni explained that Gruve begins by understanding a client’s specific AI needs and preparing their data to support AI applications. This foundational step is crucial because every business has unique processes, workflows, and client servicing methods. Only after this deep understanding do they recommend and implement AI solutions. Once implementation begins, AI agents take over specific tasks, such as detecting security breaches or managing the transition from on-premises systems to cloud-based CRM. Like traditional consultancies, Gruve partners with trusted technology vendors, including large companies like Cisco, IBM’s Red Hat, and Google, as well as specialized AI-native startups like Glean and Supervity, to deploy solutions. The Shift to Usage-Based AI Consulting A major differentiator for Gruve is its billing model. Unlike most consultancies that bill upon implementation or based on hours, Gruve’s services are available on demand, similar to how electricity or cloud computing is provided. Navin Chaddha highlighted this, stating that if Gruve implements an AI solution for security, the client is charged only when the installed AI detects and analyzes a security breach. This usage-based model aligns the cost directly with the value and outcome delivered by the AI, potentially making advanced enterprise AI more accessible and predictable for businesses hesitant about the upfront costs and uncertain ROI of traditional consulting engagements. By proving value through results, Gruve aims to build long-term relationships based on performance rather than simply hours billed. In summary, Gruve.ai is poised to disrupt the long-standing IT consulting industry by leveraging AI agents to deliver services, achieve high software-like margins, and offer a client-friendly usage-based pricing model. Their focus on moving AI projects from pilot to production, combined with significant funding and experienced leadership, positions them as a key player in the future of AI services and implementation for enterprises seeking to truly operationalize AI.

In a 40-minute appearance on The Scoop with Frank Chaparro released Wednesday, Bea framed the idea as hiding in plain sight. “Sometimes the ideas are so big that people either can’t hear them or don’t want to hear them,” he said at the top of the interview. “But they’ve got to listen to this one.” By statute, the 261.5 million-ounce US gold hoard is still recorded at $42.22 per ounce—a valuation fixed in 1973. At Wednesday’s spot price of roughly $3,303, the gap between book value and market value is almost $900 billion. “So today, because of law, the US government still values gold that it holds in Fort Knox at $42 and change,” Bea noted. “If they were to just mark that to market, that’s an incremental 900 to … I heard a billion to a trillion dollars.” From Mark-To-Market To Bitcoin Bea’s central contention is that Congress could pass a short bill amending 31 U.S.C. § 5117, re-strike higher-denomination gold certificates, and credit the revaluation gain to a sovereign-wealth-style account at Treasury in line with US president Donald Trump’s executive order for a strategic Bitcoin reserve—without adding to headline federal debt. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Explode To $210,000 This Year, Says Quant Powerhouse Presto “When the revaluation occurs, that creates a $900 billion mark-to-market gain, which the Treasury could then take in a budget-neutral manner to go and buy a variety of things. We think probably including Bitcoin,” he said. His arithmetic mirrors Senator Cynthia Lummis’ BITCOIN Act, introduced earlier this year, which directs Treasury to acquire one million BTC (around $100 billion at prevailing prices) over five years while remaining deficit neutral. Bea argued that a US purchase of that size—about 5.5% of Bitcoin’s $1.8 trillion market capitalization—would almost certainly prompt other states to respond. “It’s hard to see a situation where other governments don’t feel compelled in some way to measure up,” he said, adding that the dynamic could resemble the “competitive situation” in gold, where central banks bought a record 1,037 tonnes last year. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Net Taker Volume Turns Positive, New All-Time High Incoming? Central bank demand for gold is motivated by “the overall level of debt that they see and the concerns around the global economy,” Bea said. “So does it seem so crazy to maybe save in some Bitcoin at, say, a ninety-to-ten ratio, given the whole world is going online?” How Soon Is ‘Sooner Than Expected’? Bea would not commit to a precise timetable but told Chaparro that the legal change “could be this year.” He suggested the trigger could come from legislators seeking an offset for new outlays—or from Treasury itself if political momentum builds behind the Lummis bill. “As soon as you understand the pipes of how banks and how the government works,” he concluded, “you realize they can revalue gold and buy Bitcoin and still be budget neutral. And once that’s on the table, it’s really just a matter of political will.” At press time, BTC traded at $93,422.

Recently, a report from the popular blockchain transaction tracker, Whale Alert, caught the attention of traders and enthusiasts alike: a substantial USDC mint of 250 million coins at the USDC Treasury . This isn’t just a large number; it’s an event that sparks questions about potential capital flows, market liquidity, and the role of stablecoin s like USDC in the broader crypto market . Let’s dive into what this massive minting event could signify. What Exactly Happened with the USDC Mint? According to the alert disseminated by Whale Alert, 250,000,000 units of USD Coin (USDC) were recently minted. The reported location for this creation event was the ‘USDC Treasury’. To understand the significance, we first need to understand what USDC is and how it operates. USDC is a digital stablecoin that is pegged to the US dollar on a 1:1 basis. This means that ideally, one USDC is always equivalent in value to one US dollar. It’s managed by a consortium called Centre, founded by payment technology company Circle and cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. The core idea behind USDC is to provide a stable store of value and medium of exchange within the volatile cryptocurrency ecosystem. Minting USDC essentially means creating new tokens. This process is supposed to be backed by an equivalent amount of US dollars (or dollar-denominated assets) held in reserve by Circle and its partners. The ‘USDC Treasury’ can be thought of as the designated address or mechanism through which new USDC tokens are issued into circulation or burned (taken out of circulation). When a large amount like 250 million USDC is minted, it indicates that Circle or an authorized partner has received a significant deposit of fiat currency (US dollars) and is issuing new USDC tokens against those reserves. This injection of new stablecoins into the ecosystem is what makes the event noteworthy. Why Does a Large USDC Mint Matter for the Crypto Market? The minting of 250 million USDC has several potential implications for the broader crypto market : Increased Stablecoin Supply: Simply put, there are now 250 million more USDC tokens in existence and potentially ready to be moved or deployed. Potential for New Capital Inflow: The most common reason for minting stablecoins is that someone (an institution, an exchange, a large investor) has deposited fiat currency and wants to convert it into a digital, stable form to interact within the crypto ecosystem. This often precedes buying activity in volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Enhanced Exchange Liquidity: Large amounts of stablecoins are frequently moved to cryptocurrency exchanges to provide liquidity for trading pairs. A large mint could indicate that exchanges are preparing for increased trading volume or need to balance their stablecoin reserves. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deals: Large mints can also facilitate large over-the-counter trades, where institutions or whales trade crypto directly without using public exchanges, often settling in stablecoins. Market Sentiment: While not a direct price driver, a large mint can be interpreted positively by the market, suggesting that significant capital is positioning itself to potentially enter crypto positions. It’s crucial to note that minting USDC doesn’t *automatically* mean that 250 million dollars are about to be spent buying Bitcoin or other altcoins. The minted USDC could be used for various purposes, including: Providing liquidity on DeFi protocols. Internal transfers or treasury management by Circle or partners. Preparing for large withdrawals from exchanges (less common for a mint, but possible). Settling non-crypto transactions using stablecoins. However, given the historical patterns, large stablecoin mints are often correlated with periods of increased buying pressure or accumulation within the crypto market. How Does Circle Manage the USDC Stablecoin? Understanding the role of Circle is key to understanding USDC . As a primary issuer, Circle is responsible for ensuring that each USDC token is backed by reserves. These reserves are held in segregated accounts and are audited regularly (though the frequency and depth of audits have been subjects of discussion and regulatory focus). Circle facilitates the minting and redemption process. When a user or entity wants to mint USDC, they send US dollars to Circle’s bank accounts. Once the funds are verified, Circle instructs the Centre smart contract to mint the equivalent amount of USDC tokens and send them to the user’s crypto wallet. Conversely, to redeem USDC, a user sends USDC back to Circle, and Circle burns the tokens and sends the equivalent US dollars to the user’s bank account. The ‘USDC Treasury’ is the operational hub for these activities. Reports from Whale Alert often track movements to and from these treasury addresses, providing transparency (to some extent) into the supply dynamics of the stablecoin. Is This USDC Minting Event a Bullish Signal? Many market participants view large USDC mint events as potentially bullish signals. The logic is simple: if someone is bringing 250 million US dollars into the crypto ecosystem via USDC, they likely intend to use that capital within the ecosystem. The most common use case for large amounts of stablecoins is to purchase other cryptocurrencies. While this correlation has held true historically in many instances, it’s not a guaranteed predictor of market movements. The impact depends on: Who minted the USDC: Was it an exchange, an institution, a hedge fund, or Circle itself for operational purposes? Where the USDC is sent: Is it moved to a major exchange, a DeFi protocol, or held in a private wallet? Market Context: Is the overall market sentiment positive or negative? Are there other significant economic or crypto-specific events happening? A 250 million USDC mint is a significant amount, representing a substantial potential influx of capital. It adds dry powder to the market, which *could* be deployed into buying assets. Traders often monitor these large movements reported by Whale Alert as part of their market analysis, looking for potential signs of institutional interest or impending large trades. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Market Observer For those watching the crypto market , a large USDC mint like this provides a data point to consider: Monitor Exchange Inflows: Keep an eye on where this newly minted USDC flows. If a significant portion lands on major exchanges, it might signal intent to trade. Watch Key Price Levels: Increased stablecoin liquidity can sometimes fuel upward price movements if buying pressure materializes. Pay attention to key support and resistance levels for major cryptocurrencies. Consider Market Depth: More stablecoins on exchanges can increase market depth, potentially leading to less volatility during large trades. Stay Informed: Follow reports from Whale Alert and reputable crypto news sources to understand the context and potential follow-up movements of this large sum. It’s always wise to combine this information with other forms of analysis, including technical indicators, fundamental news, and overall market sentiment. A single data point, while interesting, rarely tells the whole story. Challenges and Considerations Regarding Stablecoins While USDC and other stablecoins play a vital role in the crypto market by providing stability and acting as on/off ramps for fiat, they also face challenges and considerations: Regulatory Scrutiny: Stablecoins are under increasing global regulatory focus regarding their reserve backing, transparency, and potential systemic risk. Reserve Transparency: While Circle provides attestations, the nature and liquidity of reserves are always points of discussion and require trust in the issuer. Centralization: Stablecoins like USDC are centrally issued and managed, which contrasts with the decentralized ethos of many cryptocurrencies. This introduces counterparty risk. Competition: The stablecoin landscape is competitive, with Tether (USDT), Dai (DAI), and others vying for market share. These factors are important to keep in mind when evaluating the broader impact of stablecoin activities like large mints. Conclusion: What Does 250 Million USDC Really Mean? The minting of 250 million USDC at the USDC Treasury , as reported by Whale Alert, is a significant event that injects substantial liquidity into the cryptocurrency ecosystem. While it doesn’t guarantee immediate buying pressure, it strongly suggests that a large amount of capital has entered the digital asset space via Circle ‘s stablecoin. This influx of stablecoins enhances the potential for trading activity, provides liquidity for exchanges and DeFi protocols, and is often interpreted by market participants as a potentially positive signal, indicating that large players are positioning themselves. As always, market observers should monitor the flow of this newly minted stablecoin to gain further insight into its intended use and potential impact on asset prices.

The House passed the Digital Assets Investment Act, or House Bill 92, on its third reading on April 30 by a vote of 71 to 44. Republican House Speaker Destin Hall introduced the bill in February, which would allow the treasurer to allocate 5% of the state’s investments into designated digital assets. The investments can only be made after obtaining an independent third-party assessment confirming that the crypto holdings are maintained with a secure custody solution and risk oversight and regulatory compliance standards are met. New amendments allow the treasurer to examine the feasibility of allowing members of retirement and deferred compensation plans to elect to invest in digital assets held as exchange-traded products ( ETPs ). The House also passed a related bill, the State Investment Modernization Act, or HB 506 , with little discussion on April 30, in a 110 to 3 vote. The bill aims to create the North Carolina Investment Authority (NCIA) to take over investment management from the treasurer. If passed into law, authority to invest in digital assets would transfer from the treasurer to NICA, and it would require approval from its board of directors based on third-party assessments to make crypto investments. Local news outlet NC Newsline reported that Treasurer Brad Briner supports both bills. Crypto legislation race.

During a NewsNation Town Hall meeting moderated by Bill O’Reilly, Trump was asked whether the duties he has threatened on foreign goods suffer from a “perception problem.” “Yeah,” he replied. “But I’m an honest guy, and we have to save the country.” The president conceded the strategy could cost Republicans control of the House of Representatives in the November midterm elections, yet insisted he will press ahead. “I just think that I’ll be able to convince people how good this is,” he said. Trump on the phone during a NewsNation Town Hall meeting. Source: NewsNation The remarks followed a Bureau of Economic Analysis estimate showing the U.S. economy shrank at the start of the year for the first time since 2022. The report cited a flood of pre-tariff imports and lower federal spending. An ADP Research release the same morning said April hiring fell short of forecasts, jolting Wall Street. Many investors want quick movement on trade, but Trump told viewers he is “in less of a hurry” than the market. He said tentative understandings exist with South Korea, Japan and India, though he warned announcements will not come overnight. “We are sitting on the cat bird seat. They want us. We don’t need them,” he declared, later adding that India wants to “make a deal so bad.” In China, Trump said there is a “very good chance” of an accord, but only “on our terms and it’s got to be fair.” When O’Reilly suggested confirmed agreements could spark a stock rally, the president replied the pacts were “potential deals,” adding, “that’s OK, it can wait two weeks.” Trump admitted his tariff playbook is tough to explain because he often opens with the hardest line, then pulls back. “You can’t just be hard line, and I’m going to run right through a wall and I’m never going to go over it or around it, I’m going to go straight — you have to be able to dodge and move,” he said. Officials are reassuring Wall Street that talks are on track US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told Fox News that an initial batch of agreements is “weeks and not months” away. “I would say that we have deals that are close,” Greer said. He emphasized he was talking about a “first tranche” of trade pacts, not the full agenda. US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on Fox News. Source: Fox News Greer said negotiations with India are not “finish line close,” though he speaks regularly with New Delhi’s lead envoy. He expects to meet South Korean counterparts “pretty soon,” describing those talks as “going in the right direction.” On Thursday, he plans sessions with Japan, Guyana and Saudi Arabia, followed by a meeting with representatives from the Philippines. Administration officials have said that Asian partners who engaged early could see their agreements announced first. The trade envoy also called newly elected Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney a “serious person” and said his office is ready to engage once Carney visits Washington. Trump spent part of the day defending his economic record and blaming the GDP slide on former President Joe Biden. “This is the Biden economy,” he told dozens of business leaders at the White House before adding, “We’ve had a lot of things happen since November 5.” Executives from General Electric, Hyundai Motor, Toyota Motor, Johnson & Johnson, Eli Lilly, Nvidia, and SoftBank attended the event, which highlighted capital spending in Trump’s first 100 days in office. The S&P 500 has fallen more than 8 percent since Inauguration Day, and consumer confidence in April fell to a near five-year low. Still, Trump argued his tariffs are fueling an “unprecedented surge” in domestic manufacturing. “Every new factory and every new job created is a sign of strength in the American economy and a declaration of confidence in America’s future,” he said as the meeting wrapped up.

According to Coinglass data , $13.9 million in long positions were liquidated in just 24 hours, compared to only $1.49 million in shorts, a nearly 1000% imbalance. This kind of imbalance shows that traders have a strong long bias. When prices decline, too many long positions can be quickly wiped out, which is what happened in this case, causing a quick cascade that drove prices even lower. Additionally, open interest fell by 4%, indicating that many traders were exiting positions. Despite this, XRP ( XRP ) has since recovered to a crucial psychological support level of about $2.20. According to some traders, this was a “flush,” removing weak hands ahead of a possible reversal. Others fear that if prices decline again, the long bias may result in additional liquidations and capitulation. This drop came at a surprising time when many traders are expecting sustained upward momentum. XRP has seen strong progress so far this year. The Securities and Exchange Commission recently paused its appeal against Ripple, paving the way for the company to potentially work with U.S. banks again in the near future.

Moreover, over ten firms have applied for XRP spot exchange-traded funds, with analysts forecasting 80% or higher odds of approval. Another catalyst that might eventually increase the volume of the XRP Ledger is Ripple’s acquisition of Hidden Road, a broker that moves more than $10 billion daily. On the technical side, the asset is trading in a tight range with no strong momentum in either direction, making the $2.15 and $2.30 levels critical to watch in the near term. Most technical indicators currently reflect a neutral outlook. With a relative strength index of 52.47, there is no discernible trend. XRP price analysis. Credit: crypto.news However, there appears to be a slight bullish bias as indicated by the moving average convergence divergence indicators, which are pointing slightly upward. While longer-term averages paint a mixed picture, shorter-term estimated moving averages (10, 20, 30) are in buy territory. The 200-day SMA and EMA are bullish and provide support at about $2.00. If XRP manages to stay above the $2.15–$2.20 range and breaks above $2.30, it could signal a shift toward a bullish trend. This would align with recent developments that favor Ripple. On the downside, failure to hold above $2.15 could lead to another round of long liquidations. Many traders are still highly leveraged, as shown by the current imbalance, which leaves the market vulnerable to sudden drops.

Users who stake HYPE can earn discounts ranging from 5% to 40%. Spot and perpetual volumes will be counted together, with spot volume weighted double. Hyperliquid will also allow linked staking and trading accounts, a new feature that adds flexibility but can’t be undone once linked.

It’s a value system that extends beyond digital assets into the gadgets we use daily. That’s why recent news regarding Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses warrants your immediate attention, as Meta has made significant changes to how it handles user data and privacy. Understanding the New Ray-Ban Meta Privacy Policy Meta recently updated the privacy policy for its smart glasses, the Ray-Ban Meta. This update grants the tech giant increased authority over storing and utilizing user data, specifically for training its artificial intelligence models. Owners received an email notification on Tuesday, according to reports, detailing these changes. A key alteration is that AI features on the glasses are now enabled by default. This means that when certain AI functionalities are active, Meta’s AI will analyze photos and videos captured through the glasses. Furthermore, Meta will now store users’ voice recordings to enhance its products, and notably, there is no direct opt-out option for this storage. How Does Meta AI Use Your Data? It’s important to clarify that the glasses are not constantly recording everything around you. The device specifically stores speech triggered by the “Hey Meta” wake word. According to Meta’s privacy notice on voice services for wearables, voice transcripts and recordings can be stored for up to one year. This data is primarily used to improve Meta’s AI products. Companies like Meta are actively seeking large volumes of diverse voice recordings. This data is invaluable for training generative AI models. By analyzing a wider range of audio, Meta’s AI can potentially become better at processing different accents, dialects, and speech patterns, leading to improved voice recognition and AI interaction. What Data Collection Should You Be Aware Of? While the voice recording storage after the wake word is a primary concern, the policy update also highlights the analysis of photos and videos when AI features are on. This means visual data captured through the glasses could also be contributing to the training data for Meta’s AI models. This extensive data collection approach is not unique to Meta. Amazon recently implemented a similar policy change affecting Echo users, routing all commands through the cloud, eliminating a local processing option. The drive for companies to collect vast amounts of data stems from the insatiable need of modern AI models for training content. Managing Your Privacy Settings Given these changes, it’s crucial for Ray-Ban Meta owners to review their privacy settings . While you cannot opt-out of voice recording storage for AI training directly, you do have control over deleting recordings. To prevent Meta from training its AI on your voice data, you must manually delete each recording via the Ray-Ban Meta companion app. This places the burden of data management squarely on the user. Consider these actionable steps: Open the Ray-Ban Meta companion app. Navigate to the privacy or settings section. Look for options related to voice recordings or AI data. Manually delete stored recordings regularly. Review default AI feature settings and disable any you don’t actively use or are uncomfortable with. The Broader Implications of AI Training Data Improving AI capabilities is the stated goal, but it comes at a cost to user privacy. Users might not fully grasp that using their glasses to photograph or video someone could potentially result in that person’s likeness contributing to Meta’s AI training data, especially if AI features are active. The sheer volume of content required by these models incentivizes companies to leverage the data their users are already generating. Meta’s history with user data isn’t new; it already trains its Llama AI models on public posts from platforms like Facebook and Instagram. This latest move with Ray-Ban Meta glasses extends that data collection frontier into personal interactions captured through wearable technology. Conclusion The updated privacy policy for Ray-Ban Meta glasses represents a significant shift towards enabling default AI features and collecting user data, including voice recordings and visual analysis, for AI training. While aimed at improving AI products, this raises substantial privacy concerns for owners. Taking proactive steps to review and manage your privacy settings, particularly by manually deleting voice recordings, is essential to maintain control over your personal data in the age of pervasive AI.

This legislative move comes in response to a $16 billion deficit in the pension system and a need for improved investment returns compared to other states. NC’s Investment Authority Could Allocate 5% Of Portfolio To Bitcoin House Bill 506 proposes the establishment of a five-member board, the North Carolina Investment Authority, which will oversee the state’s $127 billion investment portfolio. This board will be composed of the State Treasurer, who currently holds final authority over state investments, along with four other appointees. The appointments will be made by key state leaders, including the Speaker of the House, the Senate President Pro Tem, and the governor. Each appointee must possess substantial expertise in investments and have a minimum of ten years of successful management experience in pensions, endowments, or similar fields. Related Reading: Bitcoin Raging Bull Indicator Turns Back On, But This Level Holds The Key In conjunction with this restructuring, House Bill 92 allows the Investment Authority to allocate up to 5% of the state’s portfolio to cryptocurrency and Bitcoin investments. This provision is designed to limit investments to mutual fund equivalents of cryptocurrencies rather than direct purchases of specific currencies, ensuring a more cautious approach to this volatile market. Supporters of the legislation, including State Treasurer Brad Briner, believe that diversifying investments into cryptocurrencies represents a proactive strategy to enhance the fund’s performance. Democrats Raise Concerns Over Crypto Risks Briner, a Republican elected in November, has expressed a desire to modernize the investment approach, contrasting with the more conservative strategies employed by his predecessor, Dale Folwell. “We need to spread the allocation around,” said Rep. Keith Kidwell (R-Beaufort), emphasizing the importance of diversification in investment strategies. The bills are seen as a step toward utilizing emerging market opportunities to benefit state employees and retirees. However, the measures have drawn criticism from some Democrats who caution against the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrency investments. Rep. Maria Cervania (D-Wake) expressed her reservations, stating, “I still have a lot of questions about this investment strategy and the level of commitment we’re making to it.” Related Reading: Code Wars: Cardano Claims The Crown From Ethereum In Core Development Concerns about the volatility of cryptocurrencies have prompted calls for a more cautious approach to integrating them into the pension fund. The legislation has sparked varied reactions outside the General Assembly. Governor Josh Stein has voiced his support for the bills, endorsing the expansion of the Treasurer’s authority over state investments. Conversely, representatives from the State Employees Association of North Carolina have expressed opposition, highlighting potential risks for state workers’ pensions. Following their passage in the House—with House Bill 506 receiving a vote of 110-3 and House Bill 92 passing 71-44—both bills now advance to the Senate for further consideration.

Starting this week, people across several US cities can now scan their eyes at World orbs and receive Worldcoin (WLD), a cryptocurrency backed by blockchain, for the first time. For years, Worldcoin has been available in select international markets, but it was notably absent from the US until now. The delay stemmed from regulatory hurdles and privacy concerns surrounding the collection of biometric data. The project’s reliance on iris scans raised questions about user privacy and data security, issues that had to be carefully addressed before launching in a market with strict data protection laws. World is live in the USA. Verify your World ID in six key cities now. pic.twitter.com/cju65pn7L7 — World (@worldcoin) May 1, 2025 World Offers 16 WLD for Eye Scans and 150 WLD Pioneer Grant Anyone who scans their eyes at a World orb will receive 16 WLD, and those who’ve already registered with the World app will get a “pioneer grant” of 150 WLD. The cryptocurrency can be transferred and traded within the World wallet app, and users can send WLD or other digital currencies through a private chat service integrated into the app. In addition to its app, World is taking another big step to bridge the gap between crypto and traditional finance. It’s partnering with Visa to launch a debit card that will convert WLD into fiat currency at checkout, a move that will make the cryptocurrency much more practical for everyday use. Iris-Scanning Process Takes 30 Seconds, Creating a Unique ID to Prevent Duplicate Registrations The iris-scanning process is simple but effective. Users step up to a World orb, which scans their face and iris in about 30 seconds, creating a unique “IrisCode” to verify their identity. This code ensures that no one can register more than once. The orbs will be accessible at various physical locations throughout the US, including Austin, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Nashville, Miami and San Francisco. The company has also rolled out a smaller version of the orb, the “orb mini,” which is more portable and resembles a smartphone. Integrations with Platforms Like Stripe and Razer Along with the debit card, the World wallet app will expand, offering over 150 mini-apps, including one from the prediction market Kalshi. Partnerships with companies like Stripe, Match Group (the parent of Tinder) and gaming platform Razer will also integrate Worldcoin into more platforms and services, broadening its use. Altman co-founded World in 2019, initially under the name Worldcoin, with the goal of creating a decentralized global identity system. The idea was to use iris scans and blockchain technology to combat fraud and bots online. By providing users with a secure, verifiable identity, Worldcoin hopes to create a more trustworthy digital ecosystem. As more locations open across the US, people will have more opportunities to register and claim their free WLD tokens.

As AI assistants become more sophisticated, companies are exploring new ways to deploy them beyond internal operations. Amazon, a major player in both cloud computing and AI development, has recently made a significant move that opens the door for widespread public adoption of AI-powered interactions. Understanding Amazon Q Business and the Anonymous Access Update Amazon Q Business is Amazon’s enterprise-focused AI assistant hosted on AWS. It’s designed to help employees within an organization by answering questions, summarizing documents, and completing tasks based on internal company data. However, a recent update fundamentally changes its potential use case by introducing support for anonymous user access. This new capability means that companies using Amazon Q Business can now configure their AI assistants to be accessible to users without requiring them to log in or authenticate. Effectively, this transforms Amazon Q Business from a purely internal tool into a platform capable of powering public-facing interactions. Enabling Public Facing Chatbots for Enhanced Customer Service The primary implication of anonymous access is the ability for businesses to build and deploy chatbots directly on their public websites, customer support portals, and other public-facing platforms. These public facing chatbots can leverage the power of Amazon Q Business to assist customers in various ways. Imagine a customer visiting a company’s website. Instead of searching through extensive documentation or waiting for a support agent, they can interact with an AI chatbot powered by Amazon Q Business. According to Amazon, this allows guest users to: Quickly find product information. Get technical answers. Navigate documentation efficiently. Troubleshoot issues through self-service. This capability streamlines the customer experience, providing instant access to information and support, potentially reducing the load on human support teams. The Role of AWS AI in Expanding Enterprise Capabilities Amazon Q Business is built on AWS AI infrastructure, leveraging Amazon’s extensive cloud computing and machine learning resources. This provides a robust and scalable foundation for deploying AI assistants. For businesses already utilizing AWS, integrating Amazon Q Business is a natural extension of their cloud strategy. Companies can configure their Q Business applications to ingest specific data sources, such as support documents, FAQs, product manuals, or internal knowledge bases. This ensures the chatbot’s responses are grounded in the company’s actual information, providing accurate and relevant answers to customer queries. The pricing model for Amazon Q Business applications with anonymous access is consumption-based, meaning companies pay based on usage, which can be beneficial for managing costs, especially with variable public traffic. Expanding Enterprise AI Solutions This move signifies Amazon’s commitment to expanding its portfolio of enterprise AI solutions . By making AI assistants accessible to the public, Amazon is addressing a key need for businesses looking to automate customer interactions and improve efficiency. Beyond basic Q&A, Amazon has been enhancing Q with ‘agentic’ features, allowing it to perform tasks across third-party applications on behalf of users. While the initial focus for public bots might be information retrieval, future iterations could potentially enable self-service task completion directly through the chatbot interface. Amazon’s Vision for Generative AI Applications Amazon views AI, particularly generative AI, as central to its future growth. CEO Andy Jassy has highlighted the company’s significant investment and activity in this space, noting that Amazon is building over 1,000 generative AI applications across its various businesses. The company’s AI revenue is reportedly growing at a ‘triple-digit’ year-over-year percentage and represents a ‘multi-billion-dollar annual revenue run rate’. Enabling public-facing AI assistants through Amazon Q Business is a clear step towards capitalizing on this growth and making sophisticated AI tools more accessible and practical for a wider range of businesses and their customers. In conclusion, Amazon’s update to Q Business, allowing anonymous user access, is a significant development for enterprise AI. It empowers companies to deploy powerful AI assistants as public-facing chatbots, promising improved customer service, greater efficiency, and a more interactive online experience. This move underscores Amazon’s strategic focus on AI and its potential to transform how businesses operate and engage with the world.

The struggle for authenticity and quality is real, echoing concerns that resonate even within the decentralized world where verifying digital assets and content is paramount. Pinterest, the popular visual discovery engine, is the latest major platform to directly confront this issue, announcing decisive steps to tackle what’s being widely referred to as ‘AI slop’. Why is Pinterest Fighting AI Slop? The problem is straightforward: an increasing volume of low-quality, often nonsensical or repetitive AI-generated content is flooding the platform. This ‘AI slop’ dilutes the human-made content that users originally came to Pinterest to discover and save. It makes finding genuine inspiration harder and degrades the overall user experience. For a platform built on curating aspirational images and ideas in areas like home decor, fashion, recipes, and art, this influx of synthetic imagery poses a direct threat to its core value proposition. User complaints have mounted, with discussions on forums like Reddit highlighting the frustration over the difficulty of distinguishing real Pins from AI fakes. How is Pinterest Addressing Generative AI? Pinterest is rolling out a multi-pronged approach to give users more control and transparency. Their strategy focuses on identification and filtering: AI Labeling: Images detected as AI-generated or significantly AI-modified will receive an ‘AI modified’ label in the bottom left corner when viewed in closeup. This is a crucial step for transparency. Detection Methods: Pinterest will analyze image metadata where available. More importantly, they’ve developed internal classifiers designed to automatically detect AI content, even if it lacks obvious metadata markers. Creator Appeals: Recognizing that automated systems aren’t perfect, Pinterest will offer creators a way to appeal if their content is incorrectly labeled. ‘See Fewer’ Option: An upcoming feature will allow users to signal that they want to see less generative AI content in specific categories. Initially targeting areas like beauty and art, which have seen a high volume of AI Pins, this option will expand over time. Clicking ‘see fewer’ on a Pin via the three-dot menu will inform Pinterest’s recommendation system to reduce similar AI content shown to that user. These tools represent a significant investment in content moderation specifically targeting the challenges introduced by widespread AI capabilities. What Does This Mean for Content Moderation? Pinterest’s actions underscore the growing necessity for robust content moderation strategies in the age of AI. Platforms that rely on user-generated content must find ways to maintain quality and authenticity against a tide of potentially infinite, low-effort AI creations. This move sets a precedent for how large platforms might handle the influx of AI content, balancing the potential for AI to be a tool for inspiration with the need to prevent it from overwhelming genuine human creativity. The challenge lies not just in detection but also in providing users with meaningful control over their feeds. While Pinterest acknowledges that generative AI can be a source of inspiration when used thoughtfully, their new tools prioritize empowering users to curate their own experience and easily identify synthetic content. As CTO Matt Madrigal stated, the goal is to help users make informed choices and ensure AI content enhances, rather than detracts from, their discovery journey. Conclusion: A Step Towards Cleaner Feeds Pinterest’s introduction of AI labeling and filtering options is a vital step in its battle against ‘AI slop’. By giving users transparency and control, the platform is directly addressing the user backlash and the threat posed by the devaluation of human-made content. This development highlights the broader industry challenge of managing AI-generated content and signals a necessary evolution in content moderation strategies for platforms worldwide. While more tools are planned, these initial steps provide hope for users seeking a cleaner, more authentic browsing experience on Pinterest.

Commenting on Strategy’s recent accumulation of BTC, they said that miners produce around 13,500 BTC per month, “But Strategy, using cheap debt and relentless capital, has outpaced that production for months,” in a kind of “synthetic halving.” They’re not just stacking , they’re “compressing Bitcoin’s supply curve from the outside,” the analysts said before concluding: “So yes, supply is drying up. But price moves when demand breaks the equilibrium. And with infinite fiat chasing a truly scarce asset, Bitcoin’s next move won’t be linear. It will be violent. And likely irreversible.” Analyst “Rekt Capital” took a stab at Bitcoin’s price discovery roadmap, stating that the asset is trying to finalize its first price discovery correction to transition into its second price uptrend. #BTC Bitcoin Price Discovery Roadmap Bitcoin is trying to finalise its First Price Discovery Correction (green) to transition into its Second Price Discovery Uptrend (red) (Prices and time horizons are not to scale) $BTC #Crypto #Bitcoin https://t.co/yfY3h60Ywy pic.twitter.com/yahXUIpVkY — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) April 30, 2025 Bitcoin Price Outlook Bitcoin fell to an intraday low below $93,400 before recovering to $94,800 during the Thursday morning Asian trading session.

Alexei Zamyatin, the co-founder of the Bitcoin layer 2 Build on Bitcoin, told Cointelegraph at TOKEN2049 in Dubai that “the advantage of Bitcoin DeFi is that the market is much bigger, you have a much bigger retail user base that you can tap into.” “It’s not easy to convert it, but if you manage to win in Bitcoin DeFi, you win the entire market.” Zamyatin said the 300 million Bitcoin users would mean DeFi services on the blockchain would “outgrow everything we've seen so far in Ethereum and Solana.” Build on Bitcoin is one of the firms looking to win market share, offering a hybrid layer 2 solution that combines Bitcoin’s security with Ethereum DeFi capabilities via BitVM, a platform that processes Turing-complete Bitcoin contracts. Zamyatin argued that Bitcoin-native bridges are necessary for DeFi on Bitcoin as the blockchain’s security is strong, but it lacks the human talent, tools and network effects of Ethereum. Alexei Zamyatin speaking with Cointelegraph’s Ezra Reguerra at Token2049. Source: Cointelegraph Zamyatin said Bitcoin ( BTC ) yield and stablecoin products are driving strong demand for Bitcoin-based DeFi. “A lot of institutions that are buying Bitcoin now usually have to find yield on the assets they hold. So Bitcoin yield is becoming a very hot and highly sought-after thing.” Demand for Bitcoin-backed stablecoins is also skyrocketing because Bitcoin is the “best collateral,” Zamyatin added. What if we tokenized the Bitcoin ETF so institutions could get access to DeFi yields? pic.twitter.com/2HCpwbCZDS — alexei (@alexeiZamyatin) April 10, 2025 Bitcoin staking has become the main DeFi use case outside of payments, which involves Bitcoin holders locking their coins in self-custodial vaults or extractable one-time signatures to earn staking rewards on proof-of-stake blockchains like Ethereum. The Babylon Protocol is currently leading this market with $4.64 billion worth of value locked, representing nearly 80% of all value locked on Bitcoin, DefiLlama data shows. Bitcoin’s DeFi TVL is still a fraction of the $54.6 billion worth of value locked on Ethereum. Bridging solutions a controversial topic Zamyatin acknowledged the numerous hacks on blockchain bridges, but argued most of those incidents resulted from teams failing to manage their private keys, rather than from smart contract vulnerabilities . While competition in the retail market is wide open, Zamyatin noted that many institutions still hesitate to use bridges, that allow users to move value between incompatible blockchains. Related: Bitcoin NFTs, layer-2 and restaking hype ‘completely gon e’ Efforts have been made to increase the number of bridge signers from five to 50 in some cases, Zamyatin noted. However, institutions have been reluctant to adopt these solutions because they often don’t know who’s signing the transactions. For example, the Ren Protocol’s RenBTC operates via a decentralized network of nodes called Darknodes, which sign transactions to lock BTC and mint RenBTC to use on other chains. However, institutions continue to avoid these protocols due to the degree of anonymity involved and instead opt to use trusted custodians like BitGo and Coinbase Custody for such activities.

The spotlight was on SEC’s changing stance under new leadership, the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, and the growing institutional interest in crypto. The Significance Of Hidden Road Acquisition Deaton views Ripple’s acquisition of HiddenRoad as an important example of how traditional finance is blending with decentralized finance (DeFi). Ripple recently agreed to acquire Hidden Road, a prime brokerage firm, for $1.25 billion, marking a major move in the digital asset industry. Hidden Road, now approved by FINRA as a U.S. broker-dealer, allowing it to expand into areas like clearing and prime brokerage. This deal will help Ripple grow its presence in the financial industry and offer more services to big financial players. The deal is expected to close in the coming months, pending regulatory approval. Institutions Embrace DeFi, Bitcoin & XRP Stay Stable He points out that institutions and banks, which once saw DeFi as a threat, are now figuring out how to take advantage of it. He also notes that Bitcoin and XRP stayed stable, even with issues like trade wars, thanks to growing institutional support “There’s always risk, but I just don’t see how you can’t be bullish on several of these big tokens like XRP and BTC,” he said. They also discussed the rising institutional interest in digital assets, especially Bitcoin. The approval of Bitcoin ETFs was highlighted as a major milestone for crypto’s mainstream adoption.

Solana leads the charge with a 90% chance of US regulatory approval for a spot ETF by 2025, up from 70% earlier this year. XRP and Dogecoin have also seen their approval odds climb, driven by growing institutional interest, an influx of ETF filings, and a shift in regulatory posture under the current administration. As the SEC faces upcoming review deadlines, the altcoin ETF landscape is rapidly evolving. XRP Eyes $3.74 Breakout as ETF Optimism Fuels Investor Momentum XRP is showing signs of a potential breakout as investor sentiment turns increasingly bullish. Market analysts and traders are closely watching the token’s price action, with many citing a confluence of technical patterns and regulatory optimism that could see the altcoin retest its April high of $2.36—and potentially rally as high as $3.74 in the short term. At the time of writing, XRP is trading around $2.20 and is locked within a classic ”falling wedge” pattern on the daily chart, a technical formation often associated with trend reversals to the upside. This bullish setup is characterized by two converging trendlines that connect lower highs and lower lows, signaling a weakening of bearish momentum. A confirmed breakout above the wedge’s upper trendline, currently sitting at $2.40, could trigger a rally of up to 71%, with a projected target of $3.74 based on pattern measurements. XRP/USD daily chart (Source:TradingView) Adding fuel to this momentum is the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which currently hovers above its midline. This technical signal reflects that buying pressure remains strong and that the overall trend still favors a continuation to the upside. However, for XRP to realize this bullish potential, it must first maintain support at the $2.20 level and then break through the critical resistance band between $2.80 and $3.00. Market watchers view this zone as a major supply wall that previously triggered heavy selling activity. Despite short-term volatility, several prominent analysts remain confident in XRP’s ability to not only retest former highs but push significantly beyond them. Trader Dark Defender recently stated that XRP is moving in accordance with an Elliott Wave structure, suggesting that the current correction phase is part of a larger bullish wave cycle. According to Defender, the recent dip is a healthy part of XRP’s long-term price structure and paves the way for further gains. Another bullish voice, trader Allincrypto, has made a bold prediction that XRP could eventually surge to $19.27 based on long-term chart projections. Referencing the same falling wedge pattern, Allincrypto described the recent retracement as “textbook perfect,” reinforcing the narrative of a continuation rally ahead. ETF Approval Odds Improve Sharply Beyond the technical landscape, macro-regulatory developments are giving XRP an additional tailwind. The growing likelihood of a US-approved spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) has become a major narrative, with Bloomberg senior ETF analysts now placing the odds of approval in 2025 at 85%. This marks a notable increase from the 65% probability projected just two months ago. The shift in sentiment is attributed to the recent leadership changes at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which many market participants interpret as signaling a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment. ETFs from prominent asset managers like Grayscale, Bitwise, WisdomTree, Canary, Franklin Templeton, and 21Shares are currently under review. Betting markets also echo this optimism. On Polymarket, the probability of an XRP ETF approval by the end of 2025 has jumped to 80%, up from 63% just a week earlier. This surge reflects growing investor confidence in the regulatory green light, which could potentially unlock a wave of institutional capital and drive XRP demand to new heights. XRP ETF approval odds on Polymarket (Source: Polymarket) However, not all hurdles have been cleared. On April 29, the SEC delayed its decision on Franklin Templeton’s application, resetting the next review date to June 17. While this postponement introduces short-term uncertainty, analysts generally agree that the delay is procedural rather than indicative of rejection. Institutional Demand on the Horizon The broader implications of a spot XRP ETF are substantial. Approval would provide institutional investors with a regulated and familiar entry point into the XRP market, potentially transforming the token’s liquidity profile and overall demand. Just as spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs have helped drive inflows from traditional finance, a greenlit XRP product could mark a major milestone in the asset’s journey toward mainstream adoption. For now, XRP remains at a technical crossroads. Traders are watching closely for a breakout above the falling wedge, which could serve as the catalyst for another leg higher. Meanwhile, the regulatory drumbeat continues to echo in the background, offering a unique blend of chart-driven opportunity and fundamental tailwinds. Bloomberg Raises Solana ETF Approval Odds to 90% as Altcoin ETF Wave Gains Momentum In related news, the likelihood of US regulators approving a spot Solana (SOL) ETF by 2025 has surged dramatically, according to a new forecast from Bloomberg Intelligence. In an April 30 update posted to X, Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas revealed that the firm now assigns a 90% probability for a Solana ETF getting the green light from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) next year—up from just 70% in February. This significant revision reflects what Bloomberg analysts describe as an improving regulatory landscape for digital assets in the United States. Alongside Solana, the odds of ETF approval for other major altcoins like XRP and Dogecoin have also improved, now standing at 85% and 80%, respectively, according to the latest Bloomberg estimates. As of April 30, six asset managers—including Grayscale, VanEck, and 21Shares—have submitted applications to launch Solana-based ETFs. The same number of issuers are pursuing ETFs tied to XRP, while three firms have filed to list Dogecoin ETFs. In total, up to 70 crypto ETF filings are now awaiting review by the SEC, marking an unprecedented level of institutional interest in altcoin-backed investment products. According to Bloomberg, the SEC has until October to deliver final decisions on many of the pending applications. While the regulatory body has a history of extending deliberations, the political climate and growing demand from both retail and institutional investors are exerting pressure to expedite approvals. The surge in applications also follows the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s (CME) move in March to list Solana futures—an event that analysts and industry insiders see as a potential precursor to spot ETF approval. Improved Outlook for XRP and Dogecoin The renewed optimism is not limited to Solana. Bloomberg has also raised the odds of approval for ETFs tied to XRP and Dogecoin, noting that investor interest and institutional infrastructure around these assets have grown substantially. XRP has benefited from its partial legal victory over the SEC and has since re-entered the conversation as a candidate for wider institutional adoption. Six XRP ETF filings are currently on the SEC’s docket, mirroring the level of interest seen in Solana. Meanwhile, Dogecoin—a cryptocurrency born as a meme but now supported by figures like Elon Musk and used in experimental payment systems—has seen increasing legitimacy in financial markets. In April, Nasdaq requested permission to list a 21Shares ETF holding Dogecoin, reinforcing the growing institutional appetite for the asset. Despite the enthusiasm, analysts caution that final approvals may not come until late 2025 or early 2026, depending on how quickly the SEC moves through its review process. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart previously noted that the agency often takes between 240 and 260 days to fully assess such filings. Political Winds Favor Crypto The regulatory optimism is closely tied to the Trump administration’s evolving stance on digital assets. Since returning to office, President Trump has moved to replace SEC leadership and reduce what many view as excessive scrutiny over the crypto industry. These actions have been met with praise from pro-crypto lawmakers and industry groups who have long called for clearer guidelines and fairer treatment. This changing environment has energized asset managers, who see altcoin ETFs as the next logical step following the successful launch of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Analysts say approval of these products would open new doors for institutional capital to flow into the broader crypto market, potentially boosting prices and deepening market liquidity.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|REGULATION|SOL|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-01 05:30:00

The BOJ now sees full-year GDP growth of 0.5% for 2025, down from January's forecast of 1%. The au Jibun Bank Japan Manufacturing PMI rose to 48.7 in April 2025, up from a flash estimate of 48.5 and March’s 12-month low of 48.4, marking a 10th straight month of contraction, due to weaker demand and worsening concerns about U.S. tariffs. Japan’s consumer confidence index fell to 31.2 in April 2025 from 34.1 in March, marking the fifth consecutive monthly decline and the lowest level since February 2023. China ( SHCOMP ) market closed, the offshore yuan traded around 7.27 per dollar, holding steady for a second straight session in thin trading due to the Labor Day holidays, while investors remained cautious as recent PMI data signaled early signs of strain from Trump’s tariffs. Hong Kong ( HSI ) market closed India ( SENSEX ) market closed Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.24% to below 8,120 on Thursday, ending a five-day winning streak, as mining and energy stocks declined amid softer commodity prices. The Australian dollar climbed above $0.64 on Thursday, building on gains from the previous session following the release of strong trade balance data. Australia reported a trade surplus of A$6.9 billion in March, significantly higher than February’s downwardly revised A$2.85 billion and beating market expectations of A$3.13 billion. Supporting the currency further, April data showed that manufacturing activity continued to expand, with new orders rising at their fastest pace in nearly two and a half years—a positive sign for domestic demand. Taiwan on Wednesday unexpectedly raised its 2025 economic growth forecast to 3.6%, up from 3.14%, following a strong first-quarter performance driven by a surge in exports, particularly in tech, ahead of potential U.S. import tariffs. In the U.S., on Wednesday, all three major indexes ended mixed. The S&P 500 and Dow reversed early losses, rising 0.1% and 0.3%, respectively to extend their winning streak to seven days, while the Nasdaq closed 0.1% lower. Investors shrugged off recession concerns despite data revealing the first quarterly economic contraction in three years. U.S. stock futures rose sharply on Thursday, fueled by robust earnings from two major tech giants: Dow +0.55% ; S&P 500 +0.96% ; Nasdaq +1.43% . Looking ahead, investors await additional key earnings and economic reports on Thursday, with particular focus on results from Apple and Amazon.

While Ripple has not confirmed the bid, it fits in with the company’s broader expansion push, which included its recent $1.2 billion acquisition of prime brokerage Hidden Road. Ripple is also emerging from regulatory headwinds after settling with the SEC. Meanwhile, Tether is planning to launch a new US-focused stablecoin product by late 2025 or early 2026, depending on legislative progress. The firm is positioning itself as a responsible partner to US regulators while also still maintaining dominance with its $150 billion USDT. The US Treasury predicts that the stablecoin market cap could surge to $2 trillion by 2028, due to the sector’s importance in the global financial system. Ripple's Quiet Power Move Rejected Ripple reportedly made a bid of up to $5 billion to acquire Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, but the offer was rejected for being too low. This is according to a Bloomberg report on April 30. The attempted acquisition came just weeks after Circle filed for an initial public offering in the United States, which indicates a strategic move by Ripple to expand its footprint in the stablecoin market. While the deal was not accepted, it is not clear whether Ripple plans to submit a new offer. The company still has to confirm or deny the report, and no comment was received from Circle either. Ripple was last valued at $11 billion in 2024—a figure CEO Brad Garlinghouse has since called outdated—and has been on a serious acquisition streak. Earlier in April, it acquired prime brokerage firm Hidden Road for $1.2 billion to enhance trading activity related to XRP and the XRP Ledger. This aggressive expansion comes as Ripple begins to resolve long-standing legal challenges. A court ruling in August of 2024 found Ripple liable for $125 million in its case with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which was originally filed back in 2020. However, in March, Garlinghouse stated that the SEC will not appeal the ruling, which resulted in Ripple agreeing to pay a reduced sum of $50 million. The company has also been increasingly active in certain political circles. Garlinghouse and Ripple’s chief legal officer, Stuart Alderoty, reportedly met with US President Donald Trump earlier this year. Ripple also contributed $5 million to Trump’s inauguration fund and was represented at official events on Jan. 20. Tether Eyes New US Stablecoin Launch New things are in the works for other stablecoin issuers as well. Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin by market cap, is planning to launch a new stablecoin product specifically for the United States market as early as this year. In an April 30 interview with CNBC , CEO Paolo Ardoino stated that the move could happen by the end of 2025 or early 2026, depending on how quickly US lawmakers advance legislation regulating stablecoins. While USDT already dominates the global stablecoin market with a nearly $150 billion market cap and approximately 66% market share, its use in the United States is still limited, where Circle’s USDC is more prevalent. Paolo Ardoino during his interview with CNBC Ardoino said that Tether is working closely with US regulators and law enforcement agencies to position itself as a responsible player in the financial system. He pointed out that Tether sees itself as an exporter of the US dollar through digital rails, and described the dollar as “the best product the United States ever created.” Tether generates revenue by accepting US dollars to mint USDT and investing those funds into liquid and yield-generating assets like US Treasury bills. The company recorded a net income of close to $14 billion in 2024, which made it the most profitable stablecoin issuer. Despite the growing traction of USDC, especially after President Donald Trump’s election victory, Tether is still very confident in its dominant position. Ardoino explained that USDT was originally designed to serve users in emerging markets, like small villages in Africa or merchants in Istanbul. However, for the US market, the company is working on a “different product” that is more tailored to domestic needs. Analysts at Web3 research firm Nansen still firmly believe that the stablecoin sector is likely to follow a “winner-takes-most” dynamic, which suggests that USDT’s lead may continue even amid rising competition. Stablecoin Market Set for Massive Expansion With all of these latest developments, US dollar-pegged stablecoins could see their combined market cap surge to around $2 trillion by 2028. This is according to the United States Department of the Treasury’s Q1 2025 report that was released on April 30. Although the current stablecoin market cap sits at roughly $230 billion, the Treasury believes evolving market conditions could accelerate growth over the next three years. These digital assets have become widely used as on-chain cash equivalents and are increasingly seen as a modern payment mechanism. A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that is specifically designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to a traditional asset, like the US dollar. For example, 1 USDT or 1 USDC is typically equal to 1 USD. This stability makes stablecoins very useful for payments, trading, and storing value without the volatility of other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Conceptual spectrum of stablecoins’ impact (Source: US Treasury ) The report also shed some light on the rise of tokenized money market funds, which offer yield-bearing alternatives to stablecoins. However, stablecoins are still deeply embedded in the blockchain economy. This latest commentary from the Treasury is another step in the US government’s growing embrace of blockchain innovation, after President Donald Trump’s second-term inauguration in January. In a December report, the Treasury already acknowledged that cryptocurrency could form the foundation of a new financial infrastructure and could also drive greater demand for US Treasurys. Stablecoin issuers like Tether and Circle invest fiat reserves in short-term, liquid instruments like Treasury bills and repurchase agreements. The Treasury revealed in December last year that this practice modestly increased demand for short-dated Treasurys. The April report also suggests that upcoming legislation will likely formalize these practices by requiring stablecoin issuers to hold short-term government debt, strengthening the connection between digital dollars and the traditional financial system. The growing use of stablecoins, however, could also exert some pressure on retail banks to offer higher interest rates to attract depositors. The current state of the stablecoin market (Source: US Treasury ) As of late April, Tether’s USDT is still the dominant player in terms of market share and its market cap of around $150 billion.

The business, which claimed to operate a mining service where customers paid to mine crypto and receive the resulting income, was accused of scamming users across several countries, including Estonia, Mauritania, Iran, New Zealand, Poland and Romania. The complaints were first brought to the attention of Action Fraud, which is the UK’s national fraud and cybercrime reporting centre. Victims claimed they had not received the mining services they had paid for, and many also faced further demands for additional payments. Upon investigation, authorities discovered that BTCMining Limited did not have a legitimate registered address in the UK, a red flag in any business operation.

David Usher, chief investigator for the Insolvency Service, pointed to the global nature of the fraud. “The fact that BTCMining Limited was attracting customers globally makes our intervention particularly important,” Usher said. “We acted on the complaints before their reach could have affected countless more individuals. It’s vital that the public, both here in the UK and abroad, are protected from companies acting in this way.” Efforts to Contact BTCMining’s Director Fail, Raising Concerns Over Wider Impact Investigators were unable to contact the company’s director, Stibich Martins Yhaicha Luzia. He had been the sole director since the company’s incorporation in Jan. 2024. Attempts to reach him through known email addresses and telephone numbers were unsuccessful. Additionally, the company’s websites became inactive or provided no new contact details. The director’s contact address, listed with Companies House, was a residential property. The occupants were unaware of the business and had not given permission for their address to be used. Although six complaints have been formally lodged with Action Fraud, authorities believe the actual number of victims could be much higher. The complaints revealed that customers collectively lost more than $18,000. However, this figure may only represent a fraction of the total financial impact. Investigators are concerned that more individuals may have been affected. These potential victims have yet to come forward.

He said Bitcoin and other digital assets were “another tool in the tool box.” He also noted the agency aims to give President Donald Trump a decisive intelligence advantage for his decision making. Jayellis also argued that Bitcoin was pseudonymous despite popular belief the digital assets were anonymous.

He added there’s a lot of work the CIA does with law enforcement to track illicit crypto payments by bad actors, whether they are drug cartels, terrorist groups, or outlaw regimes. Jayellis acknowledged that Bitcoin is an area of technological competition where the CIA needs to ensure that the U.S. is “strategically positioned” against China and other adversaries. He also argued that the U.S. needs to ensure it is a leader in the crypto space internationally. “Bitcoin is here to stay. Cryptocurrency is here to stay. As you know, more and more institutions are adopting it, and I think that’s a great trend and one that this administration has been obviously leaning forward to.” -Micheal Jayellis, Deputy Director of the CIA. The agency’s Deputy Director believes there is potential for law enforcement and the intelligence community to use cryptocurrencies to help track and disrupt what adversaries are doing. He also said the virtual asset is a target, something the CIA can “disrupt our adversaries’ use of it.” Jayellis acknowledged the agency also uses digital currency technology to collect more intelligence and gather more information about them. He argued that Bitcoin was similar to other advanced technologies, which the CIA needed to prioritize. The CIA’s deputy director mentioned that the CIA was working on the President’s agenda, which is “ the total elimination of the cartel .” He said that it was Trump’s priority and that it was what the agency seeks to achieve, “and we’re gonna do it.” Jayellis added that it would be a collective government effort, where all parts of the U.S. government would play a role in taking down the cartel threat. The former general counsel of the National Security Agency maintained that the threat was also an international problem, similar to the threat the CIA had successfully fought for the past two decades. He said the agency needs to ensure no gaps between intelligence and law enforcement in disrupting those networks before the threat reaches the U.S. borders. Jayellis says China is the CIA’s top priority President Trump understands that we can’t pass the American Dream onto the next generation if we let China dominate us. He’s the first President of my lifetime to call China a threat to our American way of life. They’re our biggest enemy and it’s past time we fight back. pic.twitter.com/DYM1ztmGlP — Senator Jim Banks (@SenatorBanks) April 9, 2025 Jayellis gave President Trump credit for being the first to realize and point out to people that China has been competing in an unfair way. He added that Trump was the first to recognize that China was also breaking the rules on trade, international property theft, and cyber security. He condemned the previous U.S. Presidents for their policy to “enable the peaceful rise of China,” but noted Trump was the first to say it was absolutely wrong. Jayellis argued that although countries like North Korea, Iran, Russia, ISIS, and Al Qaeda are a threat to the U.S., “China is the existential threat to the United States” in the economic and technological realm. The CIA’s deputy director noted the agency’s aim is to give U.S. President Donald Trump a decisive intelligence advantage. He revealed China was a “tough target ” for the intelligence community to operate in and collect on. Jayellis said it was the CIA’s top priority to give the President the best possible intelligence on China and every other country in the world. The CIA’s executive also noted that the agency’s goal is to give the U.S. a decisive advantage in the global technological competition in all fields, including quantum computing, AI, semiconductors, and biotechnology, against China.

CertiK said in an April 30 X post that a total of $364 million was lost to exploits, hacks and scams in April, jumping from the $28.8 million recorded by CertiK in March . The firm added that white hat exploiters had returned around $18.2 million from exploits on the crypto protocols KiloEx, Loopscale and ZKsync, which brought down the month’s total. The largest hack in April, and the fifth largest to date, involved an elderly US individual who lost 3,520 Bitcoin ( BTC ), valued at $330.7 million. The Bitcoin was stolen from their wallet after a hacker used advanced social engineering tactics to gain access on April 30. Excluding that attack, April’s crypto losses were $34 million, a 21% jump from March. CertiK said phishing scams, bolstered by the Bitcoin heist, was the main culprits for losses while social engineering, access control hacks and price manipulation exploits rounded out the top four types of attacks that stole the most value. Crypto losses in April spiked to $364 million, a 1,163% increase compared to last month. Source: CertiK February still has the most significant number of crypto losses for the year so far, with $1.53 billion. Most of that was from the $1.4 billion Bybit hack by North Korea’s Lazarus Group, which also holds the crown for the largest crypto hack ever. Hackers return some funds Over $18 million was returned for the month. Decentralized exchange KiloEx suspended platform operations after suffering a $7.5 million exploit; however, on April 15, the exploiter returned all the stolen funds, only four days after the attack. The ZKsync Association also r ecovered $5 million worth of stolen tokens from an April 15 security incident involving its airdrop distribution contract.

Losses to crypto scams, exploits and hacks were declining in the final days of 2024, with December registering the smallest amount stolen at $28.6 million, compared to $63.8 million in November and $115.8 million in October.

The company has filed to list on Nasdaq under the ticker PCAPU, with each $10 unit comprising one Class A share and a fraction of a warrant — a standard setup in SPAC deals. Aiming for Crypto, Fintech, and Financial Innovation ProCap will seek to acquire companies in fintech, digital assets, and financial services — sectors where Pompliano has long-standing ties through his investments, podcast, and media presence. While no specific acquisition target has been named, the filing notes a preference for businesses with strong growth potential and a competitive edge in their space. Pompliano’s strategy is unique: he’s bringing content, capital, and community into the deal. With millions of followers, a widely read newsletter, and a top-ranked crypto podcast, Pompliano believes his media reach will drive deal flow and investor trust, setting ProCap apart from typical SPACs. However, the structure heavily favors Pompliano. He controls the sponsor entity and has secured a large chunk of founder shares for a nominal price. These shares could be worth millions if the SPAC closes a successful merger — a common setup that has previously sparked criticism in the SPAC world. Crypto Market Timing in Pompliano’s Favor? Crypto-focused SPACs have seen uneven results in recent years. But with Bitcoin recently topping $94,000 and institutional momentum building, ProCap’s timing may be better aligned with market optimism. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Donald Trump’s 2025 Tax Plan Could Spark a 1000% XRP Price Rally, Analyst Claims , The crypto community is divided. Some, like investor Mark Neuman , view the move as a revival of the SPAC trend, calling this the “bottom” and praising Pompliano’s ambition. Others are less convinced, pointing to his past ties with failed projects like BlockFi. “BlockFi promoter whose rocket ship crashed,” one commenter wrote , warning investors to be cautious with first-time SPAC sponsors.

The Digital Assets Investment Act, known as House Bill 92, advanced on April 30 with a 71 to 44 vote and now moves to the state Senate for further consideration. Introduced in February by Republican House Speaker Destin Hall, the bill authorizes the treasurer to allocate up to 5% of the state’s total investments into designated digital assets. Crypto Investments Require Third-Party Oversight Under New NC Bill However, any such investment would require an independent third-party assessment to ensure that custody, risk management, and regulatory compliance standards are met. In a new amendment to the bill, the treasurer is also permitted to evaluate whether members of public retirement and deferred compensation plans could opt into digital asset investments through exchange-traded products (ETPs). In a related move, the House also passed the State Investment Modernization Act, or House Bill 506, with a near-unanimous 110 to 3 vote. The bill proposes the establishment of the North Carolina Investment Authority (NCIA), which would assume control of investment decisions from the state treasurer. If enacted, the NCIA—not the treasurer—would have the authority to invest in cryptocurrencies, contingent on board approval and third-party validation. North Carolina Treasurer Brad Briner has expressed support for both bills, according to local outlet NC Newsline. JUST IN: North Carolina #Bitcoin Reserve legislation passes the House. pic.twitter.com/pHy8b5dUsZ — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 30, 2025 The state is now positioning itself alongside Arizona in advancing crypto-related public investment frameworks. Arizona’s legislature recently passed two crypto reserve bills, SB 1025 and SB 1373, which now await Governor Katie Hobbs’ decision. If approved, North Carolina would become one of the few states actively integrating digital assets into public financial management. The adoption of Bitcoin has found notable momentum statewide in the U.S. According to data from Bitcoin Law, 47 Bitcoin reserve bills have been introduced across 26 states, with 41 currently active. Just recently, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear officially signed House Bill 701 , known as the “Bitcoin Rights” bill, into law—making the state one of the latest to enact legislation protecting digital asset users and operations. Public Companies Boost Bitcoin Holdings by 16% in Q1 2025 Publicly traded companies increased their Bitcoin holdings by 16.1% in the first quarter of 2025, signaling continued institutional interest in the leading cryptocurrency despite market volatility. According to crypto asset manager Bitwise, total corporate Bitcoin holdings climbed to approximately 688,000 BTC by the end of Q1, with companies adding 95,431 BTC over the three-month period. Bitwise reported the combined value of these holdings reached $56.7 billion, based on a Q1 closing price of $82,445 per Bitcoin—representing a 2.2% increase in value. More recently, healthcare technology firm Semler Scientific expanded its Bitcoin holdings with a fresh $10 million purchase, signaling a continued strategic pivot toward digital assets. The latest purchase brings the company’s total Bitcoin treasury to over 3,300 BTC, valued at approximately $300 million based on current market prices.

(Report),https://cryptopotato.com/why-was-ripples-5-billion-takeover-offer-rejected-by-circle-report/,"Ripple seems determined to make a big move in the stablecoin space, but its offer to acquire the second-largest such issuer was reportedly turned down. At the same time, its own stablecoin has stalled after the initial impressive launch, and its market cap remains under $320 million, according to CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. Circle Refuses The report claimed that the takeover attempt was halted in its tracks as Circle said the offer of somewhere between $4 billion and $5 billion was too low. Citing people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg said Ripple has no plans to raise the bid to acquire the company behind the second-biggest stablecoin, USDC. In contrast, the US-based crypto giant completed the acquisition of Hidden Road, a prime brokerage company, for $1.2 billion earlier this year, in what was described as one of the largest deals in the industry. The move is expected to be a game-changer for XRP as the asset and the network behind it, XRPLedger, will be used for post-trade settlement on some transactions, as CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed. Although the SEC is yet to publish an official confirmation and many believe it’s necessary to conclude the case, Galirnghouse announced in mid-March that the legal battle between his company and the US securities watchdog had come to an end as both parties refused to continue with their appeals. It seems that Ripple’s concluding legal troubles in the US have opened the door for the company to make some big moves, albeit one of them was reportedly rejected. RLUSD Struggles? While it was stopped from taking over the second-biggest stablecoin issuer, Ripple has already entered that growing industry niche. Recall that the firm launched its own such product late last year, called RLUSD . It started on the right foot after getting the regulatory green light in the US. Its market cap continued to increase in early April, jumping by 50% within days from $200 million to $300 million, as reported at the time. However, its progress has stalled since, and the asset’s market capitalization has gained less than $20 million in the following several weeks. Nevertheless, the volumes on CEX have surged by 30% over the past day to over $50 million, according to CMC. The post Why Was Ripple’s $5 Billion Takeover Offer Rejected by Circle?

Bitcoin Supply Shock? Not Just Yet Since April 21, BTC has been trading within a tight range between $91,500 and $95,800, offering few signals about its next directional move. While some analysts have repeatedly highlighted a potential supply shock that could drive Bitcoin’s price much higher, Aleman’s analysis offers a more cautious outlook. Related Reading: Bitcoin Demand Momentum Yet To Recover From Deep Negative Zone, Analyst Says According to Aleman, BTC reserves on centralized exchanges (CEXs) have declined steadily over the past year. Specifically, reserves dropped from 2,942,077 BTC on November 11, to 2,490,318 BTC as of April 28 – marking a 15.35% decrease in just five months. During the same period, Bitcoin’s Realized Capitalization – a metric that calculates the total value of BTC based on the price at which each coin last moved – has surged from $669.32 billion to $883.03 billion. This reflects an increase in the actual capital invested in the Bitcoin network, rather than market speculation alone. Aleman explains that as BTC becomes more “expensive,” a purchase of approximately 500,000 BTC at current prices could potentially drive the cryptocurrency’s price to $130,000–$140,000. However, he cautions that such a scenario would likely trigger significant selling pressure from miners. He adds: This behavior could counteract the decline in exchange reserves, since historically, miners tend to sell more as the price goes up. So even if reserves keep falling, a price surge would likely encourage enough selling to partially offset that drop. The analyst concludes that a true supply shock in this market cycle is unlikely unless Bitcoin sees a massive influx of capital – enough to push its Realized Capitalization to three or four times its current level. Technicals Point Toward BTC Breakout Despite the low probability of a supply-driven rally, all is not lost for the leading digital asset. Several technical indicators point toward an impending bullish rally for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘Apparent Demand’ Makes Sharp Rebound – Will BTC Breakout Soon? Notably, Bitcoin’s weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) recently broke a long-standing downward trendline, indicating a potential momentum shift. This development could help BTC reclaim the $100,000 mark in the coming weeks. In addition, recent on-chain data shows that short-term holders are refraining from selling their BTC – even while in the red – which may signal growing investor confidence and a potential bullish reversal. At press time, BTC trades at $94,374, down 0.4% in the past 24 hours.

44014533,https://coinpedia.org/?p=449483,1746079505,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,Why Circle Rejected Ripple’s Bold $5 Billion Acquisition Bid?,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-circle-rejected-ripples-bold-5-billion-acquisition-bid/,"The post Why Circle Rejected Ripple’s Bold $5 Billion Acquisition Bid? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ripple’s bold $5 billion offer to acquire Circle, the issuer of USDC, has officially fallen through — and now the crypto world is buzzing with speculation. While the deal could have instantly positioned Ripple at the forefront of the stablecoin sector, Circle turned down the offer. Ripple’s $5B Offer: Top Reasons Why Circle Said No 1. Illiquid Ripple Equity Offer Insiders reveal that Circle wasn’t satisfied with Ripple’s offer and declined it, considering the valuation insufficient. According to Jungle Inc , Ripple likely didn’t offer the full amount in cash. Instead, a significant portion of the $5 billion bid may have come in Ripple equity, shares that are currently private, illiquid, and hard to value. For a company like Circle, already preparing for an IPO , trading its future for equity with uncertain market value wasn’t appealing. Although Ripple hasn’t followed up with a new bid, it’s still eyeing a possible deal. 2. Ripple’s Competing Stablecoin Ripple has already announced its own stablecoin, RLUSD , which will operate on both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum. As crypto analyst Stellar Rippler noted, acquiring Circle would have meant absorbing a direct competitor, however he also raised questions about overlap. Circle may have seen the move as a play to neutralize USDC and wasn’t ready to give up its lead in regulatory adoption and market trust. Moreover, Circle’s USDC is seen as a fully-reserved, regulated stablecoin, and acquiring it would mean Ripple could skip the slow adoption phase for RLUSD and instantly dominate liquidity. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Is Made in America, Here’s Why That Matters , 3. Circle’s Strong Pre-IPO Position As shared by John Deaton , Circle is well-funded with strong backers like BlackRock and Fidelity. Its pre-IPO shares are trading around $40, with a target IPO valuation of $5 billion. Circle was previously valued at $9B in a failed 2022 SPAC deal and raised funds at $8B in its 2022 Series F round. Given this position, Circle didn’t feel pressure to sell majorly since its own stock remains in high demand on the secondary market. 4. Regulatory and Market Edge Circle’s USDC is widely accepted in U.S. regulatory circles, with integrations across Visa, Stripe, and Robinhood. In a series of X post Stellar Rippler pointed out that Ripple could have instantly gained this infrastructure, but Circle wasn’t willing to trade it away, especially not for equity in a company launching a rival product. 5. Strategic Misalignment Analysts suggest this wasn’t about competition, but consolidation. Ripple wanted to fast-track its position in the stablecoin sector by acquiring USDC’s network and reputation. But as Stellar Rippler concluded, Circle saw more value in maintaining its independence rather than merging with a rival looking to reshape the market on its terms. In short, Ripple aimed high, but Circle wasn’t ready to be absorbed. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Ripple aimed to fast-track its entry into the stablecoin space by acquiring Circle and gaining control over USDC. What was the value of Ripple’s offer to Circle? Ripple reportedly offered $4–5 billion, though much of it was likely in illiquid Ripple equity rather than cash. Why did Circle reject Ripple’s acquisition offer? Circle declined due to strategic misalignment, regulatory edge, and confidence in its own upcoming IPO. Does Ripple have its own stablecoin? Yes, Ripple recently announced RLUSD, a new stablecoin built on the XRP Ledger and Ethereum. Will Ripple try to acquire another stablecoin firm? While no new offers have surfaced, Ripple may still seek strategic acquisitions to boost its stablecoin ambitions.",News|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|USDC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-01 06:05:05

The project, which aims to verify humans in the age of artificial intelligence, is initially coming to what it calls the “key innovation hubs” of Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville and San Francisco, according to an April 30 announcement. World offers a crypto token, Worldcoin (WLD), to those who verify their identity with its spherical device called The Orb, which scans a user’s face and eyes. The data can be used to make a World ID on the company’s platform to verify a user is human and to sign in to integrated platforms, which currently include Minecraft, Reddit, Telegram, Shopify and Discord. In addition to World’s US rollout, the company said at an event in San Francisco on April 30 that it would partner with Visa for a “World Visa card” to launch later this year for those who have scanned their eyeballs, which allows for payments using WLD tokens and other cryptocurrencies. Source: World Matchmaking with verified ID The online dating giant Match Group, which owns Tinder, Hinge, Match.com and Plenty of Fish, will also begin a pilot program testing out World ID for its apps. The firm said that the project aims to provide dating app users with the means of verifying that the profiles they interact with represent real people seeking real connections. Related: World competitor Billions Network launches non-biometric digital ID World has established separate partnerships with prediction market startup Kalshi and decentralized lending platform Morpho. Altman co-founded the project in 2019, when it was known as Worldcoin, to create a global identity verification system using the blockchain to combat fraud and bots. It rebranded to World in 2024 and currently has 26 million users globally, with 12 million of them verified through Orb scans. Source: World WLD prices initially jumped around 15% following the announcement. However, those gains have since been lost, with the token down more than 5% over the past 24 hours, trading at just over $1 at the time of writing. WLD is down more than 90% from its March 2024 all-time high of $11.74, according to CoinGecko.

Investors took their cue from Wall Street, where US stocks recovered from massive early losses to mark gains for the seventh day straight. Despite the ongoing uncertainty of President Donald Trump’s trade fight with China and other partners, Japan’s Nikkei 225 advanced 1.31% to 36,516. Traders digested the Bank of Japan ’s decision to leave its benchmark rate untouched, even as questions grow over how new and proposed U.S. tariffs could ripple through the world’s third-largest economy.

With China, South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, and much of Southeast Asia closed for the May 1 break, turnover across the region stayed light and cross-border flows were thin, leaving sentiment heavily reliant on headlines from Washington and New York. Asian stocks were heavily reliant on news from NY On Wednesday, the S&P 500 edged up 0.1% to 5,569.06, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3% to 40,669.36, and the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.1% to 17,446.34. It was a significant reversal after the S&P 500 dropped by 2.3% and the Dow cut 780 points in early trading. The early sell-off came after preliminary figures hinted that the US economy shrank in the first quarter, a stark reversal from the solid growth recorded late last year. Economists said many importers had rushed shipments ahead of expected tariff increases, distorting the numbers and igniting talk of “stagflation.” A combination of weak activity and stubborn inflation leaves the Federal Reserve with no easy response. Relief arrived later in the day when a separate report showed the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge slowed to 2.3% in March from 2.7% in February, moving nearer to the 2% target. The tariff dispute itself remains the wild card. Companies are struggling to predict costs as the administration shifts between announcing tariffs and hinting at rollbacks. “I’m not taking credit or discredit for the stock market,” Trump said Wednesday. “I’m just saying we inherited a mess.” The back-and-forth has already caused a lot of volatility in the market. During April, the S&P 500 briefly fell almost 20% below the record it set earlier this year, drawing comparisons with some of the darkest days of the Great Depression. The S&P 500 finished the month down only 0.8%, far milder than March’s drop, and now sits 9.4% beneath its peak. U.S. benchmark crude, on the other hand, slipped 10 cents to $58.11 a barrel, while Brent crude eased 5 cents to $61.01. In currencies, the dollar strengthened to 143.88 yen from 143.06 yen, and the euro slipped to $1.1308 from $1.1331.

The WSJ reported hours ago that the company is looking for someone to succeed Elon Musk for the CEO role at Tesla. Naturally, rumors started flying around and speculations as to why is this happening took shape. Many people argued that it’s an effort designed to calm investors in Tesla after the recent backlash against Musk because of his involvement with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk was quick to respond, denying the claims in the report and also saying that “it is an extremely bad breach of ethics that the [Wall Street Journal] would publish a deliberately false article and fail to include unequivocal denial beforehand by the Tesla board of directors. Meanwhile, the official Tesla account tweeted : Earlier today, there was a media report erroneously claiming that the Tesla Board had contacted recruitment firms to initiate a CEO search at the company. This is absolutely false (and this was communicated to the media before the report was published). The CEO of Tesla is Elon Musk and the Board is highly confident in his ability to continue executing on the exciting growth plan ahead. – Robyn Denholm Tesla’s stock price closed at a 3.38% loss yesterday, clocking in at $282.16.

According to data from CoinGecko , over 50% of all cryptocurrencies ever listed have now become inactive. Since 2021, nearly 7 million crypto coins have been listed on the platform. Out of these, about 3.7 million projects have stopped trading and are now considered dead. This means 52.7% of all cryptocurrencies tracked by CoinGecko, with most of these closures happening in 2024 and early 2025. 2025 Is the Worst Year So Far In just the first three months of 2025, around 1.8 million crypto coins have failed. This is the highest number of project shutdowns in a single year and makes up nearly half of all crypto failures since 2021. Experts say this big drop in crypto projects could be linked to market problems that started after Donald Trump became President again in January 2025, which caused crypto prices to fall. Meme Coins and Quick-Launch Tokens Flood The Market The total number of crypto projects has also increased in recent years. In 2021, there were around 428,000 projects listed. By 2025, that number had jumped to almost 7 million. A major factor behind this growth was the launch of pump.fun in 2024, a platform that made it extremely easy for users to create their own tokens. As a result, the market was flooded with meme coins and low-effort projects, many of which didn’t survive for long. Before 2024, the number of failed projects was much lower. But after the arrival of easy-to-use token-making platforms, the number of shutdowns jumped sharply. Along with token failures, major security breaches like the Mantra Crash and Bybit hack have shaken investor confidence.

The feature, unveiled during Token2049 in Dubai, converts crypto to stablecoins at checkout using Mesh’s proprietary SmartFunding technology. The system sidesteps the need for merchants to handle crypto directly, offering what Mesh calls a “plug-and-play” payment option through Apple Pay’s interface. This way, brick-and-mortar retailers and webshops can accept crypto payments without the need for building out the necessary infrastructure. Mesh plans to launch the feature later in the second quarter of the year. “We believe that as soon as crypto payments are as seamless as fiat payments, nothing is left to stop the mass migration of global commerce onto blockchain rails,” said Bam Azizi, CEO and co-founder of Mesh. Blockchain rails and stablecoins, which are crypto tokens pegged to the value of traditional currencies, have become increasingly central to payments. They offer faster, cheaper alternative to traditional channels, and are rapidly growing for remittances, payroll and commerce. Payments giant Stripe is testing a stablecoin tool following its acquisition of Bridge, while PayPal launched its own stablecoin.

This massacre transpired during the darkest days (for now) of US President Trump’s escalating trade war against the rest of the world. As his policy and intentions became clearer and he paused the tariffs against every single nation except for China, BTC started to recover and gained $20,000 in the next couple of weeks. Since it broke above $90,000, though, over a week ago, the asset has remained sluggish in a tight sideways channel between $93,000 and $95,000. There was a breakdown attempt yesterday, but the lower boundary held strong, and BTC is back testing the upper one now. According to several key metrics, this consolidation phase could be nearing an end, hinting at an upcoming substantial price move. Squeezing BBs Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted the reduced volatility as of late, which is shown by the squeezing Bollinger Bands. The momentum indicator, composed of three lines with the Simple Moving Average (SMA) in the middle, has tightened on the 4-hour BTC chart, and Martinez warned that “a major price move could be just around the corner.” The Bollinger Bands are squeezing on the 4-hour chart for #Bitcoin $BTC ! A major price move could be just around the corner. pic.twitter.com/uvrel12QVp — Ali (@ali_charts) May 1, 2025 Although the BBs are a secondary technical tool and do not provide a clear indication of the direction of the move, the analyst said BTC has a notable chance to head north if it remains above the key support of $93,198, which has held its price on a couple of occasions in the past week. Moreover, BTC could surge toward a new all-time high of around $114,230 if it breaks above $95,870, he added. If #Bitcoin $BTC breaks and holds above $95,870, the next key target, based on the MVRV Pricing Bands, is $114,230. pic.twitter.com/iKPJvVaUtA — Ali (@ali_charts) April 30, 2025 Accumulation Skyrockets The second and third signs hinting at an upcoming big BTC move are somewhat similar, but they are worth differentiating. On one hand, we have the growing accumulation of whales. As reported yesterday, these market participants had acquired $4 billion worth of bitcoin within just two weeks. On the other hand, there are the BTC ETFs, which broke the previous negative streak and recorded a positive one from April 17 to April 30. Although this trend came to an end yesterday, it was with a minor $56.3 million in outflows, which is far below the billions attracted before that. Martinez highlighted these substantial purchases and noted that the BTC Accumulation Trend Score has neared 1, which is a clear indication of larger entities going on a shopping spree. The #Bitcoin $BTC Accumulation Trend Score is nearing 1, signaling that larger entities, or a significant portion of the network, are actively accumulating. pic.twitter.com/eJavuF8Dmb — Ali (@ali_charts) April 30, 2025 Bonus: The number of bitcoins sitting on exchanges has been gradually declining , reaching a five-year low.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/is-elon-musk-leaving-tesla-how-will-dogecoin-be-affected-by-a-possible-separation-here-are-the-details/,"Despite rumors that Tesla was looking for a replacement for its high-profile CEO Elon Musk, Dogecoin has remained largely unaffected. Dogecoin Holds Steady as Elon Musk Denies Rumors He Will Step Down as Tesla CEO The memecoin, which is usually sensitive to Musk’s public statements and business developments, has shown little reaction to the controversy, trading between $0.16 and $0.17 over the past 24 hours, while broader crypto markets have been sideways over the same period. The Wall Street Journal reported that Tesla board members reached out to executive search firms about a month ago to explore options for a new CEO, citing concerns about Musk's increasing alignment with the Trump administration. According to the report, board members also asked Musk to publicly recommit to focusing on Tesla, but Tesla moved quickly to quash the rumors. “This is absolutely false (and was communicated to the media before this report was published),” the company wrote on its official X account early Thursday. “Tesla’s CEO is Elon Musk, and the Board of Directors is extremely confident in his ability to continue executing on the exciting growth plan ahead.” Musk reiterated the denial in a personal post, calling the story an “intentionally false article.” Musk’s influence on Dogecoin is well-documented. He has been a vocal supporter of the token for years, frequently referencing it in social media posts and interviews. Despite the occasional turmoil in Musk’s public and professional life, Dogecoin’s increasing resilience suggests that the token market is maturing beyond single-point dependency as Musk continues to remain an influential figure. *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin HODLer Whales Have Broken Their Silence Recently In a new post on X, CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has talked about how some old Bitcoin investors have shown movement recently. The on-chain indicator of relevance here is the “Spent Output Age Bands” (SOAB), which tracks the transaction activity related to a given ‘age band.’ An age band defines a time-range during which coins falling inside the band were last transacted on the network. The 1 day to 1 week band, for example, includes the part of the BTC supply that was last moved between 1 day and 1 week ago. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Demand Returning? Active Address Trend May Suggest So When addresses falling inside a particular age band make a transaction, the corresponding SOAB registers a spike. In the context of the current topic, the group of focus is the 3- to 5-year-old group. Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the SOAB of the cohort over the past day: As displayed in the above graph, the indicator has registered a large increase for the 3-year to 5-year age band, which implies the investors have just moved a huge amount of old coins. In total, the age band has been responsible for transactions involving 8,003 BTC. At the current exchange rate, this stack is worth more than $760 million in US dollars. Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they are to sell them in the future. This means that as holders mature into the older age bands, they become more resolute. The HODLers of the market (holding for more than 155 days) are known as the long-term holders. Considering that the age band from the chart involves coins older than three years, the investors holding them must be stalwart even by HODLer standards. Thus, to see these diamond hands break their long silence to move such a large stack could be a worrying sign for Bitcoin, if the motive here is for selling, as is often the case when long-dormant tokens shift. Related Reading: Dogecoin Could Rally To $0.74 ATH If Price Closes Month Above This Level, Analyst Says The movement from the 3-year to the 5-year age band has come as BTC’s recovery rally has stalled into flat price action. It’s possible that these whales think this may be their best chance of getting out with their profits, so they have decided to sell. The SOAB of this Bitcoin group and other old ones can now be worth keeping an eye on, to see if more of the resolute hands join in on the profit-taking. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $95,100, up almost 2% in the last seven days.

According to Bitcoin Laws data, that tracks the progress of crypto legislation in the US, Florida stands sixth in the race to become the first US state to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve.

Whether you’re holding a modest $2,350 portfolio or preparing for larger strategic plays, momentum in assets like Ethereum (ETH) , Solana (SOL) , Aptos (APT) , and Injective (INJ) is turning heads. With real-time price action validating technical setups, the outlook for May 2025 suggests rising confidence among investors—and rising opportunities. Ethereum and Solana Push Higher Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading around $1,830 , maintaining strength following a month of steady accumulation by whales and rising demand for infrastructure-related tokens. Analysts remain bullish, with ETH flashing a golden cross and transaction costs declining—factors that often signal the start of the next breakout phase. Forecasts remain optimistic for a move above $2,500 in the near term. Solana (SOL) , trading between $145 and $150 , is fresh off a 41% April gain , fueled in part by the approval of a Canadian spot ETF and renewed institutional interest. The key resistance at $180 remains in focus, with analysts pointing to $221 as a longer-term breakout target if current conditions hold. Long-term holder accumulation also supports a continued bullish structure. Aptos and Injective Emerge with Solid Foundations Aptos (APT) has made a strong comeback, climbing to $9.35 and delivering an 18% weekly gain . Its selection as the digital wallet provider for Expo 2025 Osaka has helped elevate the project’s visibility. Investors are tracking price action carefully, with technicals and sentiment aligning toward higher targets. Injective (INJ) remains a community favorite in decentralized finance infrastructure, trading with steady support even as broader market noise fluctuates. While April didn’t bring headline updates, Injective’s strong developer activity and solid foundation continue to draw interest from longer-term holders and traders.

In a new post, Tapiero tells his 129,100 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin may soar more than 90% of its current value due to likely Fed rate cuts to boost the economy. Tapiero believes the liquidity increase will be the catalyst to send Bitcoin to a new all-time high of $180,000. Among the economic metrics he looks at is the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond’s Expected Manufacturing Employment index, which has plummeted to levels seen only during economic crises. “Here we go again. More second-tier macro data signaling a rapid slowdown ahead. Largest drop ever – back to ’08 lows. It’s a Fed survey, so hard for them to ignore. Short rates at 4% are way too high. Same theme: more liquidity coming. BTC to $180,000 before Summer ’26… [The Richmond Expected Manufacturing Employment index is] just an indicator that shows we are at an extreme very rarely if ever reached. I search for these extreme outliers as they increase the odds that the slowdown is more severe than is currently priced in.” Source: Dan Tapiero/X Tapiero also says the worsening economic conditions will likely lead to more money printing, which will debase the US dollar. He believes the currency debasement will cause investors to pour into Bitcoin as a hedge. “Fed is playing with fire. Massive collapse in consumer expectations for the economy in the next six months (hits 54.4). Back to March 2009 lows, well below Covid panic lows. This is extreme data. Much lower rates and USD needed to offset fiscal austerity. Fiat debasement equals +BTC.” Bitcoin is trading for $94,277 at time of writing, flat on the day.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Trust Wallet’s new Stablecoin Earn feature aims to transform idle digital dollars into active opportunities, without compromising self-custody or simplicity. Stablecoins have long been considered the quiet workhorses of the cryptocurrency economy, stable in value, practical in use, yet often overlooked when it comes to unlocking their full financial potential. But as decentralized finance (DeFi) matures and stablecoins gain broader traction, new possibilities are emerging beyond simply holding digital dollars. Trust Wallet , one of the leading self-custody crypto wallets, is entering this space with its latest feature, Stablecoin Earn. Designed to turn idle assets into passive income, Stablecoin Earn allows users to access onchain yield opportunities without leaving the security of their wallet. To explore how this new feature fits into Trust Wallet’s broader vision and what it means for the future of everyday crypto use, we spoke with Eowyn Chen, the company’s CEO. 1. Stablecoins are evolving beyond being a store-of-value asset. What new opportunities does this shift create for everyday users? Stablecoins are becoming the bridge between traditional finance and web3. As they evolve from passive holdings into active financial tools, users can now access a wider range of opportunities: from earning yield on idle assets to participating in decentralized financial services like lending, payments, and even savings alternatives. This shift empowers everyday users to do more with their stablecoins without giving up control, whether it’s growing their digital savings, moving value globally, or interacting with DeFi applications in a safer, more familiar way. 2. What user behaviors or market signals led you to launch a native yield feature within Trust Wallet? We noticed that billions of dollars worth of stablecoins were simply sitting idle onchain, even as DeFi opportunities matured. Many users who trusted stablecoins as a store of value were not taking the extra step to put them to work, often due to complexity or risk concerns. Our goal with Stablecoin Earn is to remove those barriers: helping users unlock simple, transparent yield opportunities directly within their wallet, without losing custody of their assets. It’s about making web3 more useful and accessible for everyone, not just advanced users. 3. How does Stablecoin Earn extend Trust Wallet’s mission of promoting self-custody and web3 accessibility? A big part of our mission has always been to empower users through self-custody and easy access to web3 opportunities. Stablecoin Earn continues that by allowing users to grow their assets without relying on centralized intermediaries. Everything happens transparently onchain, and users retain full control at every step. By embedding this experience natively into the wallet, we make it easier for people to participate in DeFi safely and confidently, in line with our broader vision of building web2-level user experience on top of web3 foundations. 4. How does embedding onchain yield opportunities directly into the wallet lower barriers for DeFi adoption? For many users, DeFi can feel intimidating, navigating dApps, connecting wallets, understanding protocols, and managing risks can be overwhelming. By integrating yield opportunities directly into Trust Wallet’s native experience, we eliminate much of that complexity. Users no longer need to jump through multiple steps or platforms. They can simply discover, assess, and engage with trusted opportunities from within the wallet they already use, with the same security and self-custody principles they expect. It’s a major step toward making DeFi feel as simple and accessible as everyday fintech apps. You might also like: Trust Wallet tops crypto wallet downloads for March 2025 5. Stablecoin Earn integrates with various DeFi protocols, including Morpho and Kiln. What criteria guide your choice of DeFi partners for Stablecoin Earn? We take partner selection seriously. For Stablecoin Earn, we prioritize protocols that have strong reputations for security, transparency, and efficiency. Morpho and Kiln represent some of the leading efforts in optimizing onchain yields in a non-custodial, user-first way. Before any integration, we assess protocol risk models, smart contract audits, operational history, and alignment with our own self-custody principles. Our goal is to curate partners that offer users strong potential benefits without compromising safety or control. 6. Stablecoin Earn offers no lock-up periods, ensuring users full liquidity. How does Trust Wallet provide this flexibility alongside yield opportunities? The ability for users to deposit and withdraw at any time is core to how Stablecoin Earn is designed. We integrate with DeFi protocols that support liquid vault structures, allowing users to earn yield without committing to rigid lock-up terms. Behind the scenes, we work to surface only the opportunities where users maintain on-demand access to their assets. This ensures that users can benefit from yield opportunities while preserving the self-sovereign flexibility that is fundamental to Trust Wallet’s philosophy. 7. How are users’ funds managed once they interact with Stablecoin Earn, and what safeguards are in place to protect them from common DeFi risks? When users interact with Stablecoin Earn, their funds are deployed into selected DeFi strategies via smart contracts. We do not custody user funds. To mitigate risks, we carefully vet the protocols we partner with, prioritize those with strong security audits, and integrate clear transaction signing so users can see and understand every action taken. Additionally, we provide educational resources to help users make informed choices. While no system in our industry is without risk, transparency, smart contract security, and user control are the pillars of how we manage safety. 8. Are there plans to expand Stablecoin Earn with new stablecoins, blockchain networks, or additional earning strategies to further enhance the user experience? Of course, we want to give our users more options to put their assets to work without compromising self-custody. We’re exploring a number of options for Stablecoin Earn, including support for new stablecoins, additional blockchain networks, and stablecoins backed by real-world assets. We’re also looking into adding more vaults with varying risk profiles, as well as automated strategies and DeFi-native products for more advanced users. These efforts are still being shaped, but they reflect our ongoing commitment to bringing accessible, secure onchain opportunities to a broader audience .

The data from April 27 points to a noteworthy uptick in both Social Volume and Social Dominance, signals often monitored by traders to assess crowd sentiment and market positioning. Brett’s post drew attention to what he described as “early signs of life” in XRP’s market presence, reflecting growing engagement across online platforms.

The token dropped by over 16% in April and dropped by almost 80% from the highest point in February. This article examines the reasons behind the Pi Coin’s price crash and what to anticipate in May. Why Pi Network price crashed in April The value of Pi plunged in April for several reasons. First, the coin plummeted as many pioneers continued to dump their tokens following the mainnet launch in February of this year. Second, the token crashed as concerns about dilution continued. Investors are concerned about the rising number of tokens coming online this year. Over 188 million tokens were released to the market in April. This dilution is expected to continue in the coming years. Over 235 million Pi Network tokens valued at over $140 million will be unlocked this month. Additionally, over 1.43 billion tokens are valued at $869 million over the next 12 months. Token unlocks are highly dilutive since they introduce new tokens to the market. The situation is even worse when there is not enough demand from investors. It is also worse when existing investors sell their coins, as is the case with Pi Network. Pi Network token unlock schedule The value of Pi fell as exchange listings remained elusive Third, Pi Coin price imploded as exchange listings remained elusive during the month. No major exchange has listed it, including Binance, a company whose customers voted overwhelmingly for its listing. Pi Network is now listed in exchanges like OKX, MEXC, and Bitget. While these are all big exchanges, major names like Binance, Coinbase, and Upbit have not listed it. This means that the coin is not available to millions of customers. Furthermore, the token plummeted as concerns about its tokenomics persisted. In addition to the future token unlocks, concerns have been raised that insiders hold the majority of the tokens and may easily dump them as happened with Mantra whose price crashed by over 90% within a day. Pi Network has millions of pioneers, and according to its tokenomics, these ones hold over 65 billion coins. The remaining 35 billion coins are largely allocated to the insiders. Ten billion goes to the foundation reserves, which the team controls. The team, headed by two people, also received 20 billion tokens, while the remaining 5% was allocated to liquidity, which the team also controls. Pi Network price chart Why Pi Coin price may surge in May While Pi Network price has crashed recently, there is a likelihood that it will bounce back by double or even triple digits in May. The primary reason is that we expect at least one centralized exchange to list it. The most likely one is HTX, the exchange that Justin Sun acts as the advisor and shareholder. HTX was the first exchange to launch a Pi Network IoU in 2021, a token that continued to trade until February. The exchange has been sending cues that it will list it soon. A look at its social media posts shows that PI has featured in at least three of them. HTX @HTX_Global · Follow Which crypto erupts green & melt faces? 2:07 PM · Apr 30, 2025 1.5K Reply Copy link Read 583 replies An HTX listing would likely result in a significant increase in the value of Pi. However, the most consequential exchanges would be Binance, Upbit, and Coinbase. Binance is the largest exchange in the world, while Upbit holds a significant market share in South Korea. Coinbase would let US customers participate in the Pi Network. Another reason the Pi coin price may surge is that it is currently in the accumulation phase of the Wyckoff Theory. This phase is characterized by sideways movement. It is then followed by the markup phase, where the fear of missing out (FOMO) reigns.

44016241,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154401,1746083415,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,AI Shopping: Revolutionary Steps by Visa and Mastercard,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ai-shopping-visa-mastercard/,"Artificial intelligence is rapidly changing industries, and now it’s making a significant impact on how we shop and pay. Traditional finance powerhouses, Visa and Mastercard, are diving headfirst into the world of AI shopping , promising a future where intelligent agents handle your purchases for you. This move signals a major shift in the payment landscape, bringing cutting-edge AI capabilities into everyday transactions. What is Visa’s Intelligent Commerce Initiative? Visa recently announced its Intelligent Commerce initiative, a significant step towards integrating AI into the shopping experience. The core idea is to enable AI agents to “find and buy” on behalf of consumers. Imagine an AI assistant that understands your preferences, finds the best deals, and completes transactions securely, all based on parameters you set. According to Visa, this initiative puts consumers in control. “Each consumer sets the limits, and Visa helps manage the rest,” stated Jack Forestell, Visa Chief Product and Strategy Officer. The goal is to make shopping more personal, secure, and convenient by leveraging AI. To achieve this, Visa is collaborating with a diverse group of technology leaders and innovative startups. These partners include: Anthropic IBM Microsoft Mistral AI OpenAI Perplexity Samsung Stripe And others… This collaborative approach highlights the complexity and potential of Visa AI initiatives in reshaping digital commerce. How Mastercard is Enabling AI Payment Agents Not to be outdone, Mastercard also revealed its plans to empower AI agents with payment capabilities through its new Agent Pay offering. Mastercard believes this will enhance generative AI conversations for both individuals and businesses by seamlessly integrating payments into the tailored recommendations and insights already provided by conversational AI platforms. Mastercard explains that this integration means an AI agent can go beyond just offering advice. For instance, if you’re planning a milestone birthday party, an AI agent could chat with you, curate outfit and accessory selections from various retailers based on your style, the venue, and even the weather. Based on your feedback, the agent could then proceed to make the purchase and recommend the most suitable payment method, such as using Mastercard One Credential. Mastercard is also working with key partners to scale what they term “agentic commerce.” Collaborations include: Microsoft, for developing new use cases. IBM, Braintree, and Checkout.com, focusing on other aspects of AI-powered shopping and payments. These efforts demonstrate Mastercard’s commitment to integrating payments deeply within the evolving landscape of conversational AI and AI payment agents . Is This Trend Unique to Visa and Mastercard? The push towards AI shopping agents is not exclusive to these payment giants. Several other major tech players are also exploring similar capabilities. Earlier this month, Amazon began testing its own AI shopping agent feature called “Buy for Me” with a subset of users. Companies like OpenAI, Google, and Perplexity have also showcased AI agents capable of browsing websites and assisting users with making purchases. OpenAI recently updated its ChatGPT search tool to provide an improved online shopping experience, indicating the growing importance of this use case for general-purpose AI platforms. This broader trend underscores the potential for Intelligent Commerce to become a standard feature of online interaction. What Are the Benefits and Challenges of AI Payment Agents? The introduction of AI payment agents offers several potential benefits: Convenience: Agents can handle repetitive tasks, saving users time and effort. Personalization: AI can tailor recommendations and shopping experiences based on individual preferences and history. Efficiency: Streamlined processes can make finding and purchasing items faster. Accessibility: AI interfaces could potentially make online shopping easier for individuals with certain disabilities. However, this new paradigm also presents challenges: Security: Ensuring the AI agents and the underlying platforms are secure against fraud and data breaches is paramount. Privacy: AI agents require access to user preferences and potentially sensitive financial information. Managing and protecting this data is critical. Control: Users need clear ways to set limits, monitor agent activity, and revoke permissions. Transparency: Understanding how the AI makes recommendations and decisions is important for user trust. Liability: Who is responsible if an AI agent makes an incorrect purchase or encounters an issue? Addressing these challenges will be key to the successful adoption of Visa AI and Mastercard AI initiatives. The Future of Intelligent Commerce The moves by Visa and Mastercard are significant because they integrate payment capabilities directly into AI-driven experiences. This isn’t just about AI helping you find something; it’s about AI completing the transaction for you. This development has broad implications for retailers, payment processors, and consumers. It could lead to new business models, change how brands interact with customers online, and potentially impact the role of traditional e-commerce platforms. As AI technology advances and becomes more integrated into our daily lives, the concept of Intelligent Commerce , where AI agents facilitate and execute purchases, is likely to grow. Visa and Mastercard are positioning themselves at the forefront of this evolution, aiming to ensure that their payment networks remain central to the future of shopping. While the full scope and impact of these AI payment agents are yet to be seen, their introduction marks a pivotal moment in the intersection of artificial intelligence and financial services, promising a more automated and personalized future for online transactions.

In just one month, the crypto world lost a massive $364 million to scams, hacks, and phishing attacks. Most of the damage, around $337 million, came from phishing alone. But some white-hat hackers helped return about $18.2 million. Let’s dive deep into the details. $364M Lost to Scams According to a recent update from blockchain security firm CertiK, the crypto world lost nearly $364 million to various scams, hacks, and phishing attacks, making it one of the most damaging months so far this year. #CertiKStatsAlert Combining all the incidents in April we’ve confirmed ~$364M lost to exploits, hacks and scams after ~$18.2m was returned. KiloEx, Loopscale and zkSync all had funds returned by whitehat exploiters. ~$337M of the total is attributed to phishing. More… pic.twitter.com/0GBcSZgdPB — CertiK Alert (@CertiKAlert) April 30, 2025 And most of this loss, about $337 million, was caused by phishing, which means people were fooled into giving away their private info or wallet access. One major case stood out. A senior U.S. citizen lost 3,520 Bitcoin , worth over $330 million, in a phishing attack that happened on April 30. The hacker used clever tricks and social tactics to gain access to the victim’s wallet. This was one of the fifth-largest crypto hacks ever. For comparison, March only saw $29 million in crypto-related losses. That means April’s figures jumped by over 1100%, a wake-up call for the entire industry. Even if you remove the giant Bitcoin theft, April still saw $34 million in damages, a 21% rise. February: ByBit, One of the Biggest Hack In February, the crypto world saw its biggest loss of the year, around $1.53 billion. The main reason was a huge $1.4 billion hack on Bybit , believed to be carried out by North Korea’s Lazarus Group. It’s known as the largest crypto hack ever. Yet $18M Was Returned Even though many people lost money, about $18.2 million was returned by white-hat hackers. These are ethical hackers who discover vulnerabilities, but instead of stealing funds, they return them and often alert the project teams to fix the issues. Three platforms, such as KiloEx, Loopscale, and zkSync, were lucky enough to get their funds back thanks to such good actors.

44016521,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154402,1746084019,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Google Gemini Unveils Powerful AI Image Editing Tools,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/google-gemini-image-editing/,"In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, advancements like those seen in Google Gemini’s latest update are significant. For those tracking the intersection of technology and digital assets, understanding the capabilities of powerful AI models is key. Google has just announced a major upgrade to its Gemini chatbot, bringing robust native image creation and editing tools directly into the user experience. Google Gemini: Enhanced Visual Capabilities Google’s Gemini chatbot application is stepping up its game. According to a recent blog post from Google, the platform now includes integrated tools that allow users to work with images in new ways. This isn’t just about generating pictures from text prompts anymore; it’s about having the power to modify existing visuals, whether they were created by AI or uploaded from your personal device. The new native image editing functionality within Gemini is rolling out gradually, starting now and expanding to a wider audience across more than 45 languages and most countries in the coming weeks. This follows Google’s earlier piloting of an AI image editing model in its AI Studio platform, which notably drew attention for its ability to remove watermarks – a feature that sparked considerable discussion. AI Image Editing: What Can You Do? With this upgrade, Google Gemini aims to provide a more integrated and potentially more effective approach to AI image editing compared to some standalone generators. Similar to recent enhancements seen in competitors like ChatGPT, Gemini’s new tools enable a multi-step editing process. Google describes this as leading to “richer, more contextual” outcomes, where text prompts and visual modifications work together seamlessly. Here are some of the core image editing capabilities now available: Background Changes: Easily swap out the background of an image. Object Replacement: Substitute specific objects within a photo. Adding Elements: Insert new items or details into an image. Modifying Features: Alter aspects like hair color in a portrait. The idea is that you can upload an image or start with an AI-generated one and then refine it iteratively using conversational prompts within the Gemini interface. Generative AI: Powering Creative Workflows The underlying technology driving these new features is Generative AI. By integrating image generation and editing directly into the chatbot’s workflow, Google is enabling users to move beyond simple text outputs or single-step image creation. The “multi-step” flow allows for a more dynamic interaction where the AI understands context across prompts, combining text instructions with visual feedback. Google provides examples illustrating this integrated approach. Imagine uploading a personal photograph and asking Gemini to generate versions showing you with different hair colors. Another example involves asking Gemini to draft a bedtime story about dragons and simultaneously generate accompanying images for the narrative. This integration of text and visual generation within a single conversational thread represents a significant step forward in making Generative AI tools more versatile and user-friendly for creative tasks. AI Chatbot Evolution: Beyond Text This update marks a key evolution for Gemini as an AI Chatbot. Originally focused primarily on text-based interactions and information retrieval, Gemini is transforming into a multimodal assistant capable of deeply understanding and manipulating visual content alongside text. This makes the chatbot a more powerful tool for content creation, design, and personalized visual tasks. The ability to upload a personal photo and then use the chatbot to explore creative modifications or generate related visuals demonstrates a shift towards Gemini becoming a more interactive creative partner. This goes beyond merely describing images or generating new ones from scratch; it involves direct manipulation of visual data based on conversational input, enhancing the overall utility of the AI Chatbot for a wider range of applications. Image Generation: Navigating Potential Risks While the creative possibilities of enhanced Image Generation and editing are exciting, they also raise important questions, particularly regarding the potential for misuse, such as creating deepfakes. Google acknowledges these concerns. To address potential risks, Google states that images created or edited using Gemini’s native tools will include an invisible watermark. This embedded metadata can help identify that an image was AI-generated or modified by the platform. Currently, there is no visible watermark added to these images, but Google is actively experimenting with the possibility of adding a visible indicator on all images generated by Gemini in the future. This ongoing effort highlights the industry’s challenge in balancing powerful AI capabilities with the need for transparency and preventing malicious use. Benefits and Examples The benefits of these integrated tools are clear for various user groups: Content Creators: Quickly generate and modify visuals for blogs, social media, or presentations. Marketers: Create custom imagery for campaigns or marketing materials. Casual Users: Experiment with personal photos, create unique visuals for stories, or explore creative ideas without needing complex software. The examples provided by Google – changing hair color or generating story illustrations – show the range from simple personal edits to more complex creative projects. Challenges and Considerations The primary challenge remains the ethical implications of realistic image manipulation. While Google is implementing invisible watermarks, the ease with which images can be altered necessitates ongoing discussion and development of robust detection methods and responsible use guidelines. The future inclusion of visible watermarks, if implemented, could be a step towards greater transparency. Summary of the Update Google’s integration of advanced AI Image Editing and Generation tools into its Google Gemini AI Chatbot represents a significant upgrade. This allows users to modify both AI-created and uploaded images directly within the conversational interface using a multi-step process. The rollout is underway globally. While offering powerful new creative capabilities and streamlining workflows, the update also brings attention to the ongoing challenges of ensuring responsible Generative AI use and mitigating risks like deepfakes, which Google is addressing through watermarking efforts. This move positions Gemini as a more versatile and visually capable AI assistant.

The Commerce Department reported Wednesday that the US gross domestic product shrank at an annual rate of 0.3%, a reversal from the 2.4% growth posted in the previous quarter. Speaking at a White House event attended by top business executives, Trump blamed his predecessor, President Joe Biden, for America’s economic slump and said citizens “have to give him a little bit of time to get moving.” The president’s comments did not please Democratic leaders, who argued that Trump, not Biden, must answer for the economic decline. “This is not Joe Biden’s economy, Donald, it is your economy,” said House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. “It is the Trump economy; it is a failed economy, and the American people know it.” According to the White House Archives, former President Joe Biden left office when the national unemployment rate stood at 4.1%, capping off a term that saw the lowest average jobless rate of any presidency since the 1960s. The data also showed that inflation peaked during the post-pandemic supply chain disruptions but dropped to 2.9% at the start of 2024, a level nearing the Federal Reserve’s long-term target. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth expanded at a 3.1% annual rate, outpacing other G7 nations. Congress divided over Trump’s 100-day progress in office During Wednesday’s event, Trump defended his policies with plans for large-scale investments in infrastructure, healthcare, and technology, announcing $8 trillion in new private-sector commitments. He introduced several CEOs, such as Hyundai’s Jose Munoz, Toyota’s Ted Ogawa, and Johnson & Johnson’s Joaquin Duato, promising that the company heads would invest in America and improve the country’s manufacturing output. Yet, in Congress, the Senate narrowly rejected a proposed bill that would have blocked the POTUS from imposing trade tariffs. Congress had cast a 49-49 vote before Vice President JD Vance broke the tie to send away the liberals’ efforts against Trump’s trade policies. Three Republican senators, Rand Paul of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, broke ranks to support the measure, joining all present Democrats and Independents. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon lambasted the White House for being reckless with trade partners, saying Congress could not remain “an idle spectator in the tariff madness.” “ If it’s worse again in the second quarter, people would start asking, ‘Is it good policy, or is it a bad policy? ’” explained Senator Paul, one of the resolution’s co-sponsors. Retailers warn of goods shortages In other related news, import activity at the Port of Los Angeles, one of the nation’s busiest gateways for goods from Asia, has nosedived in recent weeks following the imposition of new tariffs on China. The drop-off is directly tied to steep tariffs now levied on imports from China, where duties on some goods have soared as high as 145%. In response, China has imposed retaliatory tariffs of up to 125% on US exports. According to supply chain firm Flexport, container bookings from China to America are down by as much as 60%. Some production is shifting to locations like Vietnam and Thailand, with bookings from those countries rising between 5% and 10%, but retailers aren’t sure it will be enough to fill the gap left by China. Despite the warnings, Trump is not worried about potential shortages, saying so during a televised appearance with cabinet members yesterday morning. “ Well, maybe the children will have to have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, you know? ” he reckoned. “And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

While trading volume has seen a modest lift, the broader sentiment reflects uncertainty. That being said, the Altcoin Season remains on the sidelines, as Bitcoin continues to dominate market behavior. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction Bitcoin price is showing stability, currently hovering around $94,999 with a negligible 24H change of +0.01% . Intriguingly, its 7-day volatility has dropped to a 563-day low , suggesting the market is entering a cooling-off phase. The immediate resistance at $97,000 is being tested softly, while the psychological ceiling at $100k continues to loom large. If bulls gather momentum and push through, the next major target sits around $107,000 . On the downside, BTC has strong support near $85,645 , a level that held firm during previous dips. Given its +14.30% monthly return, Bitcoin is showing resilience. But unless volume spikes substantially beyond the current $28.64B , any breakout attempt might be short-lived.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) operates in its fourth pre-sale phase while collecting $7.3 million through the distribution of over 425 million tokens. Investor interest in this project is strong as evidenced by the number of 9,200 holders who have joined to date. The upcoming phase 4 introduces a 20% cost increase up to $0.03 which will deliver significant profitability to investors. Retail investors are attracted to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) because of the strong market interest which competes against Pepe’s increasingly dominant popularity rather than Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) declines. Pepe Outpacing Shiba Inu Pepe continues to distance itself from Shiba Inu (SHIB) in terms of dominance within the meme coin sector. Retail investor affection for SHIB has waned because its community hype shows declining interest. Its price shows no real growth because investors base their decisions on speculation instead of concrete uses. No other meme coin excels like Pepe because it maintains sections of passionate social media fans who create nearly spontaneous price fluctuations. Price spikes for Pepe occur more frequently on sentiment platforms because they are generated by viral marketing events. The outdated narratives used by SHIB emerge inferior to Pepe’s active community engagement methods. Future projections indicate that Pepe coins will eclipse SHIB in the meme coin market to establish command as the top choice in its sector. The financial service provider Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents distinct opportunities to users. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Power Mutuum Finance (MUTM) maintains high investor interest through the fourth phase of its presale. The sales of Mutuum Finance tokens at $0.025 continue to expand at a rapid pace as investors contribute $7.3 million. Market demand has resulted in 9,200 active holders of the project. The upcoming Phase 5 price increase to $0.03 will deliver a profitable 20% return for present investors. The projected $0.06 listing value of MUTM tokens demonstrates an expected 140% profitability. Expert analysts foresee a market movement to $2.50 following launch that will generate a breathtaking 9,900% profit for investors. During a recent announcement the team presented a new dashboard system which reports the top 50 token holders who will receive additional rewards for keeping their positions. The competitive buying generated by this initiative helps increase interest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Security and Scalability Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gives trust a top priority by starting the process of getting its smart contract audited by Certik. When the announcement goes out to social networks it will result in increased investor faith. Network incidents experienced on the Solana blockchain create an advantage for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) through its detailed approach to security. FOMO has driven rapid sales in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) pre-sales phases one and four because buyers wanted to acquire tokens before prices rose further. The number of MUTM tokens sold brings Mutuum Finance (MUTM) toward its goal of reaching $0.06. The demand for tokens is high because investors recognize that phase 5 will introduce increased prices. The sense of haste reveals Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s ascendance in the market. Why Mutuum Shines Bright Pepe stands as a potential success story with MUTM presenting itself as the next alternative to Solana. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides investors with carefully planned stability despite Pepe’s meme-driven market domination. The presale achievements and forecasted 140% launchup exceed the stagnant growth of SHIB. Audited security combined with structured gains from Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offer investors a stronger position than what Solana provides. Potential investors should enter phase 4 before its price increase because it will rise by 20% to $0.03. Those who take risks in the crypto market should consider Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as their ideal investment opportunity.

44016759,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154403,1746084621,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Microsoft AI Faces Critical Capacity Constraints,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/microsoft-ai-capacity-constraints/,"In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, compute power is the foundational bedrock upon which innovation is built. This holds true whether you’re developing cutting-edge large language models or building decentralized applications that leverage AI capabilities. Recent warnings from Microsoft, a major player in providing this essential infrastructure, highlight a significant challenge: the sheer pace of cloud AI demand is beginning to strain available resources. Understanding the Microsoft AI Capacity Challenge During the company’s fiscal 2025 third-quarter earnings call, Microsoft’s EVP and CFO, Amy Hood, delivered a candid assessment of the situation. She indicated that customers utilizing Microsoft’s AI services could face service disruptions as early as June, the end of their fiscal fourth quarter. The core issue? Demand for Microsoft AI services is simply growing faster than the company can bring new data center capacity online. Hood stated, “We had hoped to be in balance by the end of Q4 but we did see some increased demand, as you saw through the quarter. So we are going to be a little short, a little tight as we exit the year.” This direct acknowledgment underscores the intensity of the current surge in AI adoption across various industries. Why is AI Demand Outpacing Data Center Investment? The explosion in generative AI applications and the broader integration of AI into enterprise workflows have created unprecedented demand for high-performance computing resources, particularly GPUs and specialized AI chips housed within massive data centers. While Microsoft has committed significant capital to meet this demand, the infrastructure required is complex and time-consuming to deploy. Despite this surging demand, some reports earlier this year raised questions about Microsoft’s data center strategy. Investment bank TD Cowen noted in February that Microsoft had reportedly cancelled multiple data center leases, equating to a substantial amount of power capacity. Subsequent reports also mentioned additional cancellations. Microsoft maintains that these cancellations are not necessarily related to the current capacity constraints, suggesting they might be part of ongoing portfolio management or shifts in build strategy. Crucially, Microsoft reiterated its commitment to a massive data center investment plan, earmarking $80 billion for infrastructure spending this year alone, with half designated for U.S.-based facilities. This figure demonstrates the company’s long-term view on AI growth and the foundational infrastructure needed. The Long Road of AI Infrastructure Development Building and commissioning large-scale data centers is not a quick process. Amy Hood emphasized the significant lead times involved, stating, “Just a reminder, these are very long lead time decisions, from land to build out, it can be, you know, lead times of five to seven years, two to three years.” This highlights the fundamental challenge in matching unpredictable, rapidly accelerating demand with infrastructure that requires years of planning and construction. The company is constantly engaged in a delicate balancing act, trying to forecast future demand curves years in advance to inform their build decisions. While facing near-term AI capacity constraints , Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella noted during the earnings call that the company had successfully opened data centers across 10 new countries and four new continents in the past quarter alone, illustrating their ongoing global expansion efforts to build out essential AI infrastructure . Potential Impact of AI Capacity Constraints For businesses and developers relying on Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform for their AI workloads, these constraints could translate into longer wait times for accessing powerful compute resources, potential service slowdowns, or difficulty scaling applications as quickly as desired. While Microsoft is working to mitigate these issues through ongoing builds and optimizations, the warning serves as a reminder that even the largest tech companies face physical limitations in keeping pace with the AI revolution. This situation underscores a broader challenge across the tech industry: the physical world of power grids, land acquisition, construction, and supply chains for components like GPUs creates bottlenecks for the seemingly infinite possibilities of digital AI. Navigating the Future of Cloud AI Demand Microsoft’s position is one of aggressive investment coupled with the reality of infrastructure build cycles. They are pouring billions into expanding their global footprint and acquiring the necessary hardware. The near-term tightness is a symptom of success – overwhelming demand – but also a challenge that requires careful management to avoid hindering customer innovation. The commitment to an $80 billion investment signals confidence in the sustained growth of AI. However, the warning about potential constraints indicates that the path to meeting this demand perfectly is complex and subject to the realities of large-scale construction and hardware procurement. As AI continues to evolve and integrate into more aspects of business and life, the race to build the underlying compute infrastructure will remain a critical factor. In conclusion, Microsoft’s acknowledgment of potential AI capacity constraints is a significant signal about the current state of the AI market. It highlights the immense demand, the scale of investment required, and the inherent challenges in rapidly scaling physical infrastructure. While short-term tightness is expected, the long-term strategic focus remains on massive investment to power the future of AI.

But when it comes to staking returns, many investors have started noticing a gap. The average Solana staking yield sits between 6% to 8% — decent, but not life-changing. Now, a new contender is reshaping the staking landscape: Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S). Offering 30% higher returns than Solana’s typical average through its innovative liquid staking system, Bitcoin Solaris is giving investors a rare chance to maximize passive income without sacrificing liquidity or flexibility — a breakthrough that’s attracting massive attention across the crypto community. Solana’s Strengths — And Where It Falls Short Solana brought high-speed blockchain to the masses, solving major scalability issues. Its staking system helped secure the network while rewarding participants. However, its rewards have struggled to keep pace with user expectations: Lower average yields over time due to network inflation control Locked staking, where users cannot freely use staked assets Limited DeFi usage of staked tokens without extra complex protocols For users seeking true flexibility and higher rewards, something better was needed, and Bitcoin Solaris stepped in to provide it. Bitcoin Solaris: Liquid Staking Redefined Bitcoin Solaris introduces a staking system that doesn’t just boost returns — it completely rewrites the rules. Instead of locking tokens for months, Bitcoin Solaris offers liquid staking where users stake BTC-S and receive sBTC-S tokens (1:1 ratio) in return. Here’s what makes it revolutionary: 30% higher yield compared to Solana’s typical staking rewards Immediate liquidity: sBTC-S tokens can be traded, held, or used across DeFi platforms Passive rewards continue to accumulate automatically Governance participation: sBTC-S holders can vote on protocol changes Low energy usage with Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus Could This Be Your Early Chance at the Future of Bitcoin? This liquid staking model makes earning easier, smarter, and more flexible, allowing users to grow their wealth without missing out on market opportunities. Helios: The Engine Behind Bitcoin Solaris DeFi The magic behind Bitcoin Solaris’s seamless DeFi experience is Helios — an advanced system that powers decentralized exchanges (DEXs), lending protocols, yield farming, and more. Thanks to Helios: sBTC-S tokens can be used in low-slippage DEXs Liquidity pools are optimized for fast, gas-efficient transactions Borrowing and lending become simple, transparent, and inexpensive Cross-chain bridges allow users to move assets easily between ecosystems like Solana and Ethereum Unlike traditional staking models where your capital is stuck, Bitcoin Solaris turns staked assets into usable DeFi tools, giving users the ability to earn multiple layers of rewards. Presale Live: Early Entry with Huge Potential Upside Bitcoin Solaris is currently in Presale Phase 1, and early participants are taking advantage before the next price jump: Current Price: $1.00 Next Phase: $2.00 Launch Price: $20.00 Potential ROI: Up to 1,900% Presale Duration: Only 3 months With a fixed 21 million BTC-S supply, similar to Bitcoin’s legendary scarcity model, and audited smart contracts for extra safety , early positioning could unlock massive wealth-building opportunities, especially for those combining mining, staking, and DeFi strategies. Community Growth Through the Double Rewards Referral Program One of the most attractive features that caught many crypto enthusiasts’ attention, like Crypto Roya,l is Bitcoin Solaris incentive-driven referral system to expand its global community: 5% bonus in BTC-S for referrers 5% bonus for referred users Automatic, real-time reward distribution during the presale phase How to participate: Sign up at bitcoinsolaris.com Access your dashboard and copy your unique referral link Share your link on social media, forums, or directly with friends Earn passive rewards while helping build the future of decentralized finance Click Here To Get The Full Scope Of BTC-S Referral Program Conclusion Bitcoin Solaris goes beyond fixing Ethereum’s and Solana’s limitations—it redefines decentralized finance. With 30% higher staking yields, liquid sBTC-S tokens, and smooth DeFi integration through Helios, it’s setting a new standard for crypto earnings. For anyone who missed out on Ethereum or Solana early, this is a second chance. With live technology and an active presale, Bitcoin Solaris offers real passive income potential and possibly life-changing wealth.

The report , published on April 30, alleged that the board had approached recruitment firms due to concerns over Musk’s political activity and split focus across multiple ventures. Musk took to X to denounce the article, stating that the WSJ deliberately published false information while knowingly excluding an “unequivocal denial” from Tesla’s board. Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm also issued a strong rebuttal early Thursday morning, posting on Tesla’s official X account that the board had not contacted recruiters. “This is absolutely false,” she said. “The CEO of Tesla is Elon Musk and the Board is highly confident in his ability to continue executing on the exciting growth plan ahead.” Musk and Tesla board dismissing WSJ report. Source: Elon Musk Related: WSJ debacle fueled US lawmakers’ ill-informed crusade against crypto Musk under scrutiny for role in DOGE The WSJ’s report comes amid growing scrutiny of Musk’s political involvement, particularly his advisory role in US President Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Critics argue that his involvement with the Trump administration has hurt Tesla’s brand, especially in international markets. Tesla’s first-quarter profit plunged 71%, and its market value has declined by over $800 billion since the start of the year. The automaker’s Q1 results released show revenues hit $19.34 billion, missing Wall Street estimates by 7.85% and marking a 9.2% fall from the same period last year. However, the firm held onto its Bitcoin during the first quarter of 2025. Tesla’s digital asset holdings dropped 11.61% in value from $1.076 billion to $951 million in Q1, alongside Bitcoin’s 11.56% price fall to $82,514 over the same time. Musk, who also runs SpaceX, Neuralink, and the recently merged X and xAI, has agreed to shift more of his time back to Tesla in response to shareholder pressure. According to reports, he is now advising DOGE remotely and has scaled back his physical presence in Washington. Related: Elon Musk’s sale of X to xAI just made fraud lawsuit ’a lot spicer’ Crypto executives lash out at WSJ Musk’s backlash against the WSJ adds to a growing chorus of criticism from crypto executives who have recently accused the outlet of misleading coverage and bias against the digital asset industry . On April 12, Binance’s former CEO Changpeng Zhao dismissed a WSJ report that claimed he has agreed to provide evidence against Tron founder Justin Sun as part of a plea deal with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ). “WSJ is really TRYING here. They seem to have forgotten who went to prison and who didn’t,” Zhao wrote in an April 12 X post. “People who become gov witnesses don’t go to prison. They are protected. I heard someone paid WSJ employees to smear me.” Soruce: CZ In March 2023, Tether also rejected a WSJ report alleging it used fake documents and shell companies to maintain banking access, calling the claims “stale,” “inaccurate,” and “misleading.” Magazine: Binance hits back at WSJ, Hong Kong crypto ETF’s take ‘$50B equivalent’: Asia Express",,EN,0,0,ASIA|DOGE|EXCHANGE|MARKET|BNB,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-01 07:37:53

According to the official site , the House passed North Carolina’s Digital Assets Investment Act, or House Bill 92 on its third reading on April 30 with a vote of 71 to 44. The crypto investment bill is now headed towards the Senate for approval or rejection before it can be passed into legislation . HB 92 was first introduced in February this year by Republican House Speaker Destin Hall. The crypto investment bill would allow the state treasure to invest government funds into digital assets that fulfill certain requirements. First, the digital asset must be in the form of an exchange-traded product or ETP. Second, the average market cap for the crypto asset must be at least $750 billion within the span of a year, as determined by the state treasurer using commercially reasonable methods. You might also like: North Carolina introduces bill to allow the use of crypto to pay taxes Additionally, the crypto investment bill stipulates the state treasurer can only invest in digital assets after obtaining an independent third-party assessment confirming that the crypto holdings are maintained under a secure custody solution. The crypto asset should also abide by regulatory compliance standards and risk oversight. Amendments made to the crypto investment bill’s draft have also ensured that the treasurer may be allowed to assess the feasibility of letting members of retirement and deferred compensation plans to elect to invest in digital assets in the form of exchange-traded products. Earlier in April, North Carolina representatives introduced another bill that would allow the use of crypto assets for tax payments as well as other economic transactions. Similar to its predecessor, HB 92, the draft lists down a series of requirements that chosen crypto assets have to fulfill in order to be eligible for tax payments and other economic transactions. So far, Arizona has become the first state to come close to passing crypto draft bills into law. Though, North Carolina seems to be running second in the race. On April 28, Arizona’s House approved two legislation, SB 1025 and SB 1373, which propose different methods for establishing a Strategic Bitcoin ( BTC ) Reserve.

44017045,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154404,1746085224,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,AI Benchmark: Shocking Study Accuses LM Arena of Gaming Chatbot Arena,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ai-benchmark-gaming-study/,"In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence, AI benchmark tests like Chatbot Arena are crucial for comparing the performance of different AI models . However, a recent study has cast a shadow over the integrity of one of the most popular platforms, Chatbot Arena, run by LM Arena. The findings, detailed in a new paper from researchers at Cohere, Stanford, MIT, and Ai2, suggest that LM Arena may have provided preferential treatment to certain top AI labs , potentially allowing them to manipulate their rankings on the leaderboard. Allegations Against LM Arena and Chatbot Arena The core accusation leveled by the study authors is that LM Arena , the organization behind the widely used Chatbot Arena benchmark, did not maintain a level playing field for all participants. Specifically, the paper highlights several practices that allegedly favored a select group of industry-leading AI companies, including Meta, OpenAI, Google, and Amazon. These practices, according to the researchers, amount to ‘gamification’ of the benchmark process. Key allegations from the study include: Private Testing Access: Certain companies were reportedly allowed to test multiple variants of their AI models privately on the platform before public release. Selective Score Publication: After private testing, these favored labs allegedly did not have to publish the scores of their lower-performing model variants, only revealing the results of the best performers. Unequal Battle Frequency: The study found evidence suggesting that models from certain companies appeared in a higher number of Chatbot Arena ‘battles’ (side-by-side comparisons voted on by users), giving them more data and potentially an unfair advantage in improving their models or scores. Sara Hooker, VP of AI research at Cohere and a co-author of the study, stated that only a handful of companies were aware of or received significant amounts of this private testing opportunity, calling it a form of ‘gamification’. LM Arena’s Response to the Accusations LM Arena, which originated as an academic project from UC Berkeley, has long presented Chatbot Arena as an impartial and community-driven evaluation platform. In response to the study’s claims, LM Arena co-founder Ion Stoica called the paper full of ‘inaccuracies’ and ‘questionable analysis’. In statements and posts on X, LM Arena defended its commitment to fair evaluations and invited all model providers to submit more models for testing. They argued that one provider submitting more tests than another does not inherently constitute unfair treatment. LM Arena also contested the study’s methodology and conclusions regarding battle frequency for models from non-major labs and the correlation between Chatbot Arena performance and other benchmarks like Arena Hard. A principal researcher at Google DeepMind also disputed specific numbers in the study, claiming Google had only submitted one model for pre-release testing, not the number implied by the paper. Study Limitations and Context The study authors acknowledged one significant limitation: their reliance on ‘self-identification’ by prompting AI models about their origin to classify them during private testing. While this method is not entirely foolproof, the authors noted that LM Arena did not dispute their preliminary findings when shared. This controversy comes shortly after Meta faced criticism for optimizing a Llama 4 model specifically for ‘conversationality’ to perform well on Chatbot Arena, only to not release that optimized version, while the standard release performed worse on the benchmark. At that time, LM Arena had stated Meta should have been more transparent. The current study adds another layer of scrutiny to the transparency and fairness of the AI benchmark landscape, especially as LM Arena recently announced plans to launch as a company and raise capital. Recommendations for a Fairer Benchmark The study proposes several changes to improve the fairness of Chatbot Arena: Establishing clear and transparent limits on private testing. Publicly disclosing scores from private pre-release tests. Adjusting the sampling algorithm to ensure all models appear in a similar number of battles. LM Arena has pushed back on some suggestions, particularly the idea of publishing scores for non-public pre-release models, arguing it ‘makes no sense’ as the community cannot test them. However, LM Arena has indicated receptiveness to creating a new sampling algorithm to address concerns about battle frequency. Conclusion: Trust and Transparency in AI Benchmarking The accusations against LM Arena raise important questions about trust and transparency in the critical area of AI benchmark testing. As AI continues to advance and become more integrated into various aspects of technology, the methods used to evaluate AI models must be perceived as fair and impartial by all participants. The study highlights the challenges organizations face in maintaining neutrality when dealing with powerful AI labs and underscores the need for clear, publicly available policies regarding testing, data collection, and score reporting to ensure benchmarks like Chatbot Arena remain reliable indicators of AI performance.

44017040,https://coinpedia.org/?p=449501,1746085298,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,Ripple Says UK Crypto Regulation Could Unlock Massive Growth,https://coinpedia.org/news/ripple-says-uk-crypto-regulation-could-unlock-massive-growth/,"The post Ripple Says UK Crypto Regulation Could Unlock Massive Growth appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As the UK government unveils its draft crypto regulation, Ripple is positioning itself to seize what it sees as a massive opportunity in the British market. Cassie Craddock, Ripple’s Managing Director for the UK and Europe, says the new proposals reflect the country’s “huge potential” to become a global leader in crypto — especially with its “second-mover advantage.” Ripple Backs the UK’s Regulatory Direction Craddock expressed strong support for the UK’s approach to crypto oversight , calling the draft legislation both “flexible” and “globally competitive.” She noted that Ripple already operates one of its largest international offices in London, underlining the company’s confidence in the region’s long-term potential. Craddock added that while countries like the US, Singapore, and the EU have made earlier regulatory moves, the UK could catch up — and even surpass them — if it delivers the right framework for innovation. “There’s a huge opportunity for the UK here,” Craddock said. “If done right, the country can become a globally competitive crypto market.” Ripple XRP News Highlights Industry Split While Ripple remains optimistic, others in the crypto industry are sounding the alarm. Critics argue that the UK’s regulatory direction, while promising, still lacks clarity. Coinbase UK’s Head, Keith Grose in an interview with CNBC , warned that without solid, supportive rules, the UK risks losing its edge — and potentially its startups — to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions. “The UK has the potential,” Grose noted, “but there’s a real risk of driving innovation elsewhere if the government doesn’t move quickly.” .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Circle Rejected Ripple’s Bold $5 Billion Acquisition Bid? , Stablecoin Rules Still in Limbo One of the biggest hurdles? Stablecoins. Mark Fairless of ClearBank told CNBC that although the bank is eager to launch its own stablecoin, they’re unable to proceed due to vague and incomplete guidance. Industry leaders believe meaningful progress might be stalled until the Bank of England releases a clear framework — which could take years. Crypto Startups Still Face Banking Trouble Another major challenge is access to banking. A survey showed that half of UK crypto firms were denied or lost bank accounts. Keith Grose says this makes it tough for businesses to grow. Without proper banking support, he warns, the UK could lose out on becoming a real crypto hub. Overall, Ripple stays hopeful, but the message is clear: smart, clear rules are key if the UK wants to lead in crypto. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Many feel the regulations are still vague and may drive companies to more supportive regions like the US or Singapore. What’s holding back stablecoin innovation in the UK? Unclear regulatory guidance is preventing companies like ClearBank from launching stablecoins. Are UK crypto startups struggling with banking access? Yes, over half of them have faced account closures or rejections from traditional banks. Could the UK still become a global crypto hub? Yes — but only if it delivers clear, supportive regulations and addresses banking barriers quickly.",News|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-01 07:41:38

According to SoSoValue data , the 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $56.23 million in outflows on April 30, breaking an 8-day streak that had brought in nearly $4 billion. Most of the pullback came from Fidelity’s FBTC and ARK & 21Shares’ ARKB, which lost $137.49 million and $130.79 million, respectively. Grayscale’s GBTC and Bitwise’s BITB also lost $31.96 million and $23.02 million. On the flip side, BlackRock’s IBIT, the biggest BTC ETF by net assets, managed to pull in $267.02 million, helping offset some of the overall losses. The other Bitcoin ETFs didn’t see any flows that day. Total trading volume across these funds hit $2.39 billion, with total net inflows since launch standing at $39.14 billion. Investors turned cautious after Bitcoin failed to hold above $95,000 especially following some disappointing U.S. economic numbers . First, the ADP jobs report showed only 62,000 private sector jobs added in April, way below the 108,000 expected and the weakest since July 2024. You might also like: Trump blames Biden as markets weaken on GDP and tariff turmoil Then, the first estimate for Q1 GDP came in at negative 0.3%, missing forecasts of +0.2%. A big reason for the GDP dip was a 41% jump in imports, as businesses rushed to stock up ahead of President Trump’s fresh wave of tariffs. At present, Trump’s tariff plans are causing jitters across markets . His administration has been pushing for new tariffs on Chinese goods and select European products, aiming to boost U.S. manufacturing but also raising the risk of higher costs and supply chain disruptions. Many companies are racing to import goods before these tariffs fully kick in, adding extra pressure to economic data and contributing to the recent jump in imports. These tariff concerns are feeding into broader fears of stagflation, a mix of weak growth and stubborn inflation, making investors unsure about when or how much the Fed might cut rates. As a result, riskier assets like tech stocks got hit hard on April 30, with the Nasdaq dropping 2% and the S&P 500 sliding 1.5%. Bitcoin ( BTC ) also fell 2% to $93,438 before recovering some ground today.

In April, the crypto sector lost a staggering $364 million to exploits, scams, and hacks, a 1,163% surge from the $28.8 million recorded in March, according to an April 30 X post from blockchain security firm CertiK. The surge was largely driven by a single attack targeting an elderly American, who lost 3,520 Bitcoin worth $330.7 million. As previously reported by crypto.news, the attacker reportedly used advanced social engineering tactics to gain access to the victim’s wallet, making it the fifth-largest crypto theft on record. Excluding that incident, April’s losses totalled $34 million, still representing a 21% rise from the previous month. CertiK identified phishing, access control exploits, social engineering, and price manipulation as the primary attack vectors. Some of the losses were mitigated due to successful recovery efforts by affected protocols and white hat hackers. Roughly $18.2 million in stolen funds were recovered over the course of April, according to CertiK. This included full repayments to KiloEx, which had suffered a $7.5 million exploit but saw the funds returned just four days later.

According to ZKsync, the attacker agreed to return all funds in exchange for a 10% bounty. Similarly, DeFi protocol Loopscale managed to reclaim all of the assets stolen in an attack that exploited vulnerabilities in its token pricing functions. The platform recovered $5.8 million after negotiating directly with the attacker, who agreed to return the funds in exchange for a 10% whitehat bounty and immunity from legal action. Although April saw a sharp rise in losses, February remains the costliest month of the year so far. As crypto.news reported earlier, February saw crypto losses soar to $1.53 billion, driven almost entirely by two major incidents. The $1.46 billion exploit on crypto exchange Bybit accounted for the majority of losses, while stablecoin issuer Infini lost $49.5 million in a separate attack.

44017274,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154405,1746085825,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Amazon AI Launches Powerful Nova Premier Model,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/amazon-nova-premier-model/,"In the fast-evolving world of technology, advancements in artificial intelligence continue to capture significant attention, influencing everything from cloud computing to data analysis. Amazon, a major player in the tech landscape, has recently made a notable move with the introduction of its latest AI offering, Nova Premier. This development is particularly relevant for anyone tracking major tech trends, as AI’s integration across various sectors, including those impacting blockchain and digital assets, continues to deepen. Introducing Amazon AI’s Most Capable Offering: Nova Premier Amazon recently unveiled Nova Premier, positioning it as the most capable model within its Nova family of artificial intelligence models. This release is a key part of Amazon’s expanding portfolio, designed to tackle complex tasks that demand a deep understanding of context, sophisticated multi-step planning, and precise execution across diverse data sources and tools. Key features of the Nova Premier AI Model include: Multi-modal Processing: It can process text, images, and videos, offering a versatile approach to data interpretation. (Note: Audio processing is not supported by this specific model). Large Context Window: With a context length of 1 million tokens, Nova Premier can analyze a substantial amount of information simultaneously, equivalent to approximately 750,000 words. Designed for Complexity: Engineered to excel in tasks requiring intricate understanding and execution. Accessing Nova Premier via Amazon Bedrock The new Nova Premier model is made available through Amazon Bedrock , the company’s comprehensive platform for building and scaling generative AI applications. Bedrock provides a foundation for developers to access a variety of leading AI models, including now Nova Premier, simplifying the process of integrating advanced AI capabilities into their projects. Pricing for Nova Premier in Bedrock is structured as follows: $2.50 per 1 million tokens for input (fed into the model). $12.50 per 1 million tokens for output (generated by the model). This pricing is competitive with other flagship models available on similar platforms, such as Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro. Benchmarking the New AI Model: Strengths and Weaknesses While Amazon positions Nova Premier as highly capable, its performance on various benchmarks presents a mixed picture when compared to some rival flagship models. According to Amazon’s internal testing: Strengths: Nova Premier performs well on tests related to knowledge retrieval (SimpleQA) and visual understanding (MMMU). Weaknesses: It trails behind models like Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro on coding tests (SWE-Bench Verified) and shows weaker performance on benchmarks measuring math and science knowledge (GPQA Diamond and AIME 2025). It’s also important to note that Premier is not designed as a ‘reasoning’ model in the same vein as some others, meaning it doesn’t allocate extra time and computing resources for extensive fact-checking or deliberation on answers. Strategic Focus: Generative AI and Model Distillation Amazon is particularly highlighting Nova Premier’s potential for ‘distillation’. This process involves using a larger, more capable model like Premier to ‘teach’ or transfer its capabilities for a specific task into a smaller, more efficient model. This can result in faster and more cost-effective AI solutions tailored for particular use cases. This strategic focus underscores Amazon’s deep commitment to the broader field of Generative AI . CEO Andy Jassy has emphasized the company’s extensive investment in AI, revealing that Amazon is developing over 1,000 generative AI applications. He also stated that Amazon’s AI revenue is experiencing triple-digit year-over-year growth and represents a multi-billion-dollar annual revenue run rate, signaling that Amazon AI is a central pillar of the company’s future growth strategy. Conclusion: A Key Step in Amazon’s AI Ambitions The launch of Nova Premier represents a significant step for Amazon in expanding its AI capabilities and strengthening its offering within Amazon Bedrock . While it may not outperform rivals on every single benchmark, its multi-modal processing, large context window, and strategic positioning for tasks like model distillation make it a valuable addition to the AI landscape. As Amazon continues to heavily invest in and develop its Generative AI portfolio, Nova Premier is poised to play a crucial role in enabling developers to build more sophisticated and efficient AI applications.

The boost in confidence follows recent leadership changes at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which oversees crypto regulation . An XRP ETF would allow institutional investors to gain exposure to XRP through traditional markets, potentially opening the floodgates to billions in capital. Bitcoin ETFs, launched earlier in 2024, have already seen nearly $39 billion in net inflows. If XRP ETFs attract even a modest 15% to 30% of that volume, it could send XRP into a major rally. For instance, a 15% share of Bitcoin ETF inflows would bring in about $5.85 billion, which could push XRP’s price to $12.23, representing a 450% gain from its current level of $2.22. If XRP ETFs pull in 30%, XRP could skyrocket to $22.20, a staggering 900% surge. When Will XRP ETF Be Approved? Momentum is building. Prediction platform Polymarket now places the odds of an XRP ETF approval at 80%, up sharply from 68% last week. Major asset managers—Bitwise, WisdomTree, and Franklin Templeton—have all filed proposals. While the SEC has delayed its decision on Franklin Templeton’s XRP ETF to June 17, industry insiders believe that approval is becoming increasingly likely. Should that happen, XRP may follow in Bitcoin’s footsteps and witness a parabolic price explosion. When will the XRP Price go up? Market sentiment is turning increasingly bullish. We can expect XRP to reclaim its April peak of $2.36 in the short term, with fresh all-time highs likely in 2025. Popular trader Dark Defender sees the recent dip as part of a broader bullish pattern, while Allincrypto projects XRP could hit $19.27 in the longer run. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Is Made in America, Here’s Why That Matters , XRP Price Today: Key Levels to Watch Despite the bullish ETF narrative, XRP price has dipped 5%, weighed down by weaker U.S. economic data. The altcoin is currently forming a bullish technical setup, and a breakout above $2.40 could send it straight to $3.74. For this upside to materialize, XRP must hold its ground above the critical $2.20 support and overcome resistance at $2.80–$3.00. If it does, the altcoin could enter a fresh rally phase. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The move also requires Nasdaq’s clearance before trading can commence under the planned ticker symbol, GLXY, according to a recent announcement . Galaxy CEO Calls Nasdaq Move a “Milestone” for Expanding Access to Crypto and AI Galaxy CEO and founder Mike Novogratz described the step as a “milestone” in a statement on April 30, emphasizing that it will strengthen Galaxy’s role in bridging investor access to the digital asset and artificial intelligence sectors. The dual-market presence would broaden the firm’s visibility and attract a wider pool of institutional investors. Galaxy has traded on the TSX since July 2020 but is down roughly 12.28% year-to-date, according to Google Finance data, reflecting broader market headwinds. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq 100 has fallen 7.33% in 2025, though April brought a slight rebound, helping to boost sentiment among tech and crypto investors. Galaxy’s U.S. listing ambitions coincide with renewed optimism in Nasdaq-listed crypto firms. Coinbase (COIN) rose 17.80% in April, while MicroStrategy (MSTR), led by Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor, gained 31.86%. Bitcoin mining company CleanSpark (CLSK) also surged by 21.58%, according to Google Finance data. Novogratz, a well-known Bitcoin proponent, remains committed to growing Galaxy’s investment footprint. The firm’s Galaxy Ventures Fund I LP is reportedly targeting up to $180 million in capital by June, aiming to support about 30 startups in the crypto and blockchain space. Prominent crypto entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano noted the market’s resilience in an April 30 post on X, highlighting that the Nasdaq 100 finished April up more than 1%. “And people are still talking about the Great Depression,” he quipped, calling the market’s reaction “insane.” The Nasdaq 100 ended April up more than 1% and people are still talking about the Great Depression. Insane. — Anthony Pompliano (@APompliano) May 1, 2025 If Galaxy secures the necessary approvals, it will soon join the ranks of major crypto firms anchoring their future to U.S. capital markets, underscoring a growing convergence between traditional finance and digital assets. Galaxy Digital UK Arm Secures FCA License Last month, Galaxy Digital secured a regulatory license for its UK subsidiary on Wednesday. The license from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) would allow Galaxy to offer derivatives trading capabilities in the UK. Further, the license will help the firm’s investment banking unit to offer capital-raising and advisory services from its London office. Galaxy Digital UK would also support its asset management business with activities like fund distribution. In March, the Office of the Attorney General of the State of New York (OAG) fined Galaxy Digital $200 million following an investigation into its alleged market manipulation of the cryptocurrency Luna. The investigation, conducted under the Martin Act and New York Executive Law Section 63(12), found that Galaxy engaged in deceptive trading practices by promoting Luna while secretly offloading its holdings. Galaxy Digital allegedly began acquiring Luna in 2020 directly from Terraform Labs at a significant discount, with the understanding that it would use its influence to drive interest in the token.

The post argues that the components commonly perceived as separate, such as XRP, XLM, Starlink, and Grok, are interlinked parts of a premeditated infrastructure shift leading to a globally unified digital system. The tweet begins by dismissing the “X” brand as a superficial rebranding decision. Instead, it claims “X” is the marker for a coordinated global transformation. Stellar Rippler states that those who view XRP, XLM, Grok (xAI), and Starlink as unrelated entities are mistaken, and that these technologies are intentionally converging under Musk’s vision for a future shaped by digital control and connectivity. A Unified System of Identity, Payments, and Access According to the tweet, Musk is consolidating influence over four key domains. First is identity through verified user systems on the X platform. Second is communication, which the commentator attributes to X’s overarching role as a communication hub. Third is finance, through the development of XPay, which is said to integrate monetary transactions. Finally, the fourth component is access, through the expanding coverage of Starlink’s satellite internet network. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The post emphasizes that XRP and XLM are ISO 20022-compliant , enabling them to serve as interoperable currency settlement layers across different financial systems. XRP is identified as the preferred infrastructure for institutional banking transactions, while XLM is associated with retail-level financial activity. Meanwhile, Starlink’s satellite network provides internet access and is a foundational component for global payment networks. Internet as the Foundation for Crypto Settlement Stellar Rippler claims that Starlink is essential to blockchain functionality, stating that “no internet = no crypto.” Starlink’s capacity to deliver internet in remote or underdeveloped areas, including regions without traditional financial infrastructure, is presented as key to enabling peer-to-peer payments using digital assets like XRP and XLM—even in offline conditions. The tweet references Ripple Labs’ ongoing work on offline payment capabilities via the XRP Ledger, suggesting this aligns with Starlink’s functionality. From PayPal to X: A Long-Term Strategy for Global Control The tweet connects the rise of Ripple and other fintech innovations to the early work of the PayPal Mafia, particularly Musk, Peter Thiel, and Max Levchin. According to the post, Ripple was once framed as a “PayPal 2.0.” Now, the development of the X ecosystem, coupled with AI identity verification from xAI’s Grok, represents what the commentator calls Phase 3 of a long-term plan. Stellar Rippler frames the trajectory as deliberate and multi-phased: beginning with PayPal as an early digital payment system, progressing through Ripple’s development of cross-border remittance solutions , and culminating now in a fusion of orbital internet, digital assets, artificial intelligence, and programmable finance under the “X” brand. The final part of the post argues that this infrastructure will facilitate a system of global programmable liquidity. The commentator contends that this system will operate largely outside of legacy financial institutions and be coordinated through Starlink’s orbital network, AI tools such as Grok for identity verification, and settlement layers built on XRP and XLM. Summing up the message, Stellar Rippler writes that “X will become the layer you live on,” suggesting that the world is gradually shifting into a digitally governed ecosystem that will be omnipresent and infrastructure-independent.

44017525,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154406,1746086446,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Staggering Meta AI Revenue: $1.4 Trillion Forecast Revealed,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/meta-ai-revenue-forecast/,"The world of technology and finance is often full of surprises, but few compare to the scale of the numbers recently revealed regarding Meta’s ambitions in the artificial intelligence space. Unsealed court documents have lifted the curtain on the tech giant’s internal projections, showing a truly staggering potential for Meta AI revenue from its generative AI products. Understanding the Generative AI Revenue Forecast According to court documents made public on Wednesday, Meta made internal predictions last year forecasting significant revenue from its generative AI initiatives. For the year 2025, the company anticipated bringing in between $2 billion and $3 billion. Looking further ahead, the projections become exponentially larger, with a forecast ranging from a substantial $460 billion to an astonishing $1.4 trillion by the year 2035. These documents were submitted by legal counsel representing book authors who are suing Meta, alleging the company used their copyrighted works without authorization to train its AI models. It’s important to note that the documents do not provide a precise definition of what Meta specifically categorizes as a “generative AI product” when making these forecasts. However, based on public information, Meta is actively developing and deploying generative AI across several areas that could contribute to this projected revenue. How Meta Plans to Generate Trillions While the exact breakdown leading to a potential $1.4 trillion in generative AI revenue by 2035 isn’t detailed in the unsealed documents, Meta has several public-facing initiatives that point towards potential revenue streams. These include: Llama Model Ecosystem: Meta has released its Llama collection of models as open source, fostering a large ecosystem. The company has revenue-sharing agreements in place with certain partners who host or utilize these models commercially. API Access: A recently launched API allows businesses and developers to customize and evaluate Llama models, potentially opening up significant B2B revenue streams through usage fees or premium features. Meta AI Assistant: CEO Mark Zuckerberg mentioned during the company’s Q1 earnings call that Meta AI, the company’s AI assistant, could eventually incorporate advertising and potentially offer a subscription tier with additional features. This positions the AI assistant as a direct consumer-facing revenue channel. These diverse approaches demonstrate Meta’s strategy to monetize its AI investments across different parts of the market, from developers and businesses to end consumers. Massive AI Spending Powers the Meta Forecast Achieving such ambitious revenue targets requires significant investment, and the court documents also shed light on Meta’s substantial AI spending . According to the filings, Meta’s budget specifically for its “GenAI” product groups exceeded $900 million in 2024 and is projected to surpass $1 billion in the current year. This figure represents the direct budget for the AI product teams themselves. Beyond the product group budgets, the infrastructure required to train and run large AI models like the Llama models adds billions more to Meta’s expenditures. The company has previously announced plans to spend between $60 billion and $80 billion on capital expenditures in 2025, primarily focused on building expansive new data centers essential for its AI operations. The Cost of Data and the Lawsuit Context The court documents also touch upon the significant costs associated with acquiring training data for AI models. Meta reportedly discussed spending upwards of $200 million in 2023 to acquire data for Llama, with approximately $100 million specifically allocated for licensing books. However, the lawsuit alleges that Meta ultimately chose not to pursue these licensing deals on a large scale and instead opted for pirating ebooks, which is the core of the authors’ legal challenge. These details highlight the complex and costly nature of AI development, including the legal and ethical considerations surrounding training data. Meta has not yet publicly commented on the specifics revealed in these unsealed documents. Conclusion: A Glimpse into AI’s Trillion-Dollar Future The unsealed court documents offer a rare look into the internal financial expectations of one of the world’s largest tech companies regarding generative AI. The forecast of potentially reaching $1.4 trillion in Meta AI revenue by 2035 underscores the immense economic potential Meta sees in this technology. However, this potential is coupled with massive investment requirements and significant legal challenges, particularly concerning the acquisition of training data. As generative AI continues to evolve, the path to these trillion-dollar revenues will likely involve navigating complex technical, financial, and legal landscapes.

Binance announced on Apr. 24 that it would remove ALPACA and three other tokens from its platform following a routine evaluation. The exchange cited factors such as low trading volume and developer inactivity. ALPACA spot trading pairs will be disabled on May 2, while deposits and withdrawals were phased out in the days after the announcement. Normally, tokens drop in value after delisting news, but ALPACA did the opposite. After briefly declining in response to the news, ALPACA surged by as much as 2,300% in just a few days, jumping from $0.029 to a peak of $1.47, a 60x increase on some trading pairs. ALPACA is now trading at $0.53, down 40% in 24 hours but still up 1,100% over the past week, as per CoinGecko data . The rally appears to have been driven by a short squeeze. After the delisting news, many traders opened short positions expecting the price to collapse. However, they were forced to buy back the token to cover losses when ALPACA unexpectedly surged, which caused the price to rise even further. You might also like: Bitget to take legal action against eight accounts for $20M VOXEL token manipulation The squeeze was further tightened when Binance modified its funding rates. The funding cap was increased from ±2% to ±4%, and settlement intervals were reduced from four hours to one hour, which resulted in higher costs for short sellers. This made holding bearish positions expensive and risky. Meanwhile, ALPACA’s supply tightened. A supply shock was caused by the team’s suspension of new token issuance and the burning of about 35 million tokens, or 18.6% of the maximum supply. Some on-chain observers suspect market manipulation . Positions totaling more than $50 million, including $43 million from short sellers, were liquidated. It’s possible that coordinated whale activity contributed to price increases which caught leveraged traders off guard. The situation was likened to the Gamestop short squeeze of 2021, in which institutional short sellers were outbid by retail traders. However, there are still concerns about how long the ALPACA pump can last and what will happen after Binance’s final delisting.

World, the company behind the distinctive eyeball-scanning Orb devices, is making significant moves to integrate its technology into everyday services. Recently, World announced a series of pivotal World Partnerships designed to boost sign-ups and showcase practical uses for its unique biometric verification system. This isn’t just about proving you’re human; it’s about creating seamless access and utility in the digital world. Expanding Reach Through World Partnerships World is strategically teaming up with major players across different sectors. One notable collaboration is with Match Group, the parent company of popular dating app Tinder. This partnership aims to bring World’s ID verification capabilities to Tinder users in Japan, enhancing trust and security on the platform. Imagine a dating app where verifying your unique human identity is a standard feature. Beyond dating, World is also integrating its verification for easier sign-ins. Collaborations with platforms like Kalshi, an events prediction market, and Morpho, a decentralized lending protocol, mean users can potentially access these services using their World-registered Biometric ID . This move simplifies user onboarding and login processes, leveraging the uniqueness of biometric verification. Introducing the Crypto Visa Card Perhaps the most anticipated announcement is the planned launch of The World Card, in partnership with Visa. This development is particularly exciting for the cryptocurrency community. Expected to become available in the U.S. later this year, The World Card will link directly to World’s World App, enabling users to spend digital assets at any location that accepts Visa. Here’s what makes The World Card interesting: It connects to the World App. Allows spending of cryptocurrencies anywhere Visa is accepted. Features automatic exchange of crypto to fiat when needed for transactions. May offer rewards, potentially for specific AI subscriptions and services. This initiative directly addresses a key challenge for crypto users: bridging the gap between digital assets and traditional commerce. A dedicated Crypto Visa Card makes spending digital wealth as easy as using a regular debit or credit card, removing friction from everyday transactions. The Journey of World Coin and Digital Identity Since its founding in 2019 by Tools for Humanity, World has attracted substantial venture capital funding and has onboarded millions of users globally. However, achieving mainstream adoption has presented challenges, partly due to the unique and sometimes perceived as cumbersome method of verifying identity via Orb scans. The concept of a global, verifiable Digital Identity based on biometrics is ambitious and complex. These new partnerships signal World’s strategic pivot towards broader accessibility and practical applications. By integrating with platforms like Tinder, Kalshi, Morpho, and especially Visa, World is targeting audiences who might not have initially sought out biometric verification but could find value in the services it enables. The utility provided by The World Card could be a significant driver for new users to engage with the World ecosystem and obtain their World Coin -based identity. The goal is clear: move beyond just signing up users to demonstrating tangible benefits of having a World ID in diverse real-world and digital scenarios. Making it easier to spend crypto, verify identity on social platforms, or access financial services are concrete steps toward integrating World’s technology into daily life. What These Partnerships Mean for Adoption The success of these collaborations will be crucial for World’s growth trajectory. Partnering with a globally recognized brand like Visa instantly lends credibility and provides a massive potential user base for The World Card. Similarly, integrating with a widely used app like Tinder, even initially in one market like Japan, exposes the technology to millions and normalizes the concept of biometric verification for online interactions. These integrations represent World’s effort to overcome previous adoption hurdles by embedding its service within existing, popular platforms rather than requiring users to adopt a new ecosystem from scratch just for identity verification. Providing a tangible financial tool like a Crypto Visa Card powered by their identity layer adds significant value proposition for potential users. Conclusion: A Step Towards Mainstream Digital Identity World’s recent announcements mark a pivotal moment in its development. By forging strategic World Partnerships with giants like Visa and Match Group, and integrating with platforms like Kalshi and Morpho, World is actively working to make its Biometric ID technology more accessible and useful. The forthcoming Crypto Visa Card is a particularly strong incentive, promising to bridge the gap between World Coin and everyday spending. These efforts demonstrate a clear path towards potentially achieving broader adoption for its unique approach to Digital Identity , proving that proving humanness can unlock real-world utility.

44017804,https://timestabloid.com/?p=65690,1746087095,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Why Ripple Offered $5 Billion to Acquire Stablecoin Issuer Circle,https://timestabloid.com/why-ripple-offered-5-billion-to-acquire-stablecoin-issuer-circle/,"Ripple reportedly offered $4–5 billion to acquire Circle, the issuer of the second-largest U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, USDC, in a bold strategic move that could redefine the global financial landscape. While the deal has not materialized—at least not publicly—the mere existence of such a proposal reveals Ripple’s ambitions are far greater than launching another stablecoin. This isn’t about market competition. It’s about consolidation, infrastructure control, and becoming the backbone of the next-generation financial system. This perspective was brought to public attention by crypto analyst and macro strategist Stellar Rippler, whose deep-dive thread on X outlines how this rumored acquisition attempt fits into a broader geopolitical and technological power play. According to Stellar Rippler, the timeline of events suggests that Ripple’s offer was anything but arbitrary. It was a calculated maneuver with implications stretching far beyond stablecoin dominance. (1/ ) Why would Ripple, which is launching its own stablecoin ($RLUSD), try to acquire a direct competitor? Because it’s not about competition — it’s about consolidation. Let’s break down what no one’s saying: pic.twitter.com/vSmEsdPB8A — Stellar Rippler (@StellarNews007) April 30, 2025 From RLUSD to USDC: A Strategic Timeline Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, was officially announced in May 2024. Designed to run natively on both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum, RLUSD was Ripple’s attempt to enter the highly saturated stablecoin market. However, entering the arena as a newcomer poses significant challenges. Market leaders like Tether (USDT) and Circle’s USDC already dominate liquidity pools, trading pairs, and user adoption across centralized and decentralized platforms. While Ripple geared up for RLUSD’s rollout, Circle was strengthening its foothold. USDC expanded to more blockchain networks, deepened relationships with U.S. financial partners like Visa and Stripe, and positioned itself as the leading “compliant” stablecoin within U.S. regulatory frameworks. By late 2024, whispers emerged about tensions regarding Circle’s valuation and internal governance, coinciding with what appears to have been Ripple’s $5 billion acquisition overture. The timing was anything but coincidental. With RLUSD still in its infancy and USDC leading in institutional trust and regulatory favor, Ripple likely recognized an opportunity to skip the steep uphill climb of organic stablecoin adoption. Acquiring Circle would mean instant access to a fully mature liquidity network, trusted reserve infrastructure, and an embedded position in the evolving regulated crypto-financial ecosystem. A Play for Infrastructure, Not Competition On paper, Ripple and Circle might appear to be competitors. But in practice , they serve complementary functions that, if combined, could transform Ripple into something far more powerful: a consolidated, end-to-end financial stack provider. While Ripple already powers cross-border payments and CBDC solutions for governments and financial institutions via the XRP Ledger and its CBDC platform, it lacks a dominant retail stablecoin with widespread integration across consumer-facing platforms. USDC fills that gap. USDC is one of the most widely adopted stablecoins and the most institutionally favored. It’s fully backed by U.S. Treasuries, integrated into platforms like Robinhood and Visa, and often cited in U.S. policy discussions as the gold standard for compliant digital dollars. By acquiring Circle, Ripple wouldn’t just gain a stablecoin—it would inherit a ready-made network of payment rails, regulatory goodwill, and real-world utility. Such a move would instantly position Ripple as the default settlement layer for both retail-facing stablecoins and wholesale CBDCs, blurring the lines between what are currently separate financial silos. In essence, Ripple wouldn’t just be competing with traditional banks and payment processors—it would be building a parallel financial system. Reimagining the Role of RLUSD A critical question raised by this scenario is the future role of RLUSD . If Ripple owns USDC, does RLUSD become obsolete? Not necessarily. The two could coexist as part of a tiered financial architecture. USDC, with its broad consumer base and merchant integrations, would remain the retail-facing stablecoin. RLUSD, on the other hand, could evolve into a wholesale rail designed for institutional liquidity corridors, government-to-bank CBDC pipelines, and enterprise-level settlements. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This dual-stablecoin model would offer Ripple remarkable flexibility. By housing a trusted retail stablecoin and an optimized wholesale token under one umbrella, Ripple could streamline everything from microtransactions to central bank settlements—all without relying on third-party infrastructure. Regulatory Alignment and the Shadow of Tether The stablecoin landscape is increasingly shaped by regulatory scrutiny. Tether (USDT), while still the market leader in volume, faces ongoing questions about transparency and compliance. USDC, by contrast, is emerging as the regulatory favorite—a position that would be immensely valuable to Ripple, whose strategy has long hinged on legal clarity and institutional trust. Owning USDC would position Ripple as the U.S. government’s most viable private-sector partner for regulated digital value. In an environment where regulatory compliance determines survival, that alignment isn’t just useful—it’s existential. A Signal to the Market—and a Vision for the Future While the Ripple–Circle deal may ultimately remain unrealized, the fact that Ripple was reportedly willing to spend over $5 billion speaks volumes. It signals a vision that goes far beyond stablecoin competition. Ripple isn’t trying to win a share of the market—it’s trying to become the market. Through strategic acquisitions, network expansion, and regulatory alignment, Ripple is constructing a global financial infrastructure stack capable of absorbing the current system and upgrading it for a tokenized, interoperable future. This approach echoes the core message from Stellar Rippler’s analysis: Ripple’s stablecoin ambitions are not about challenging Circle—they’re about integrating it. Ripple’s potential integration of stablecoin infrastructure with XRP-powered systems could redefine its position beyond fintech. It would be a sovereign-grade financial network operating parallel to legacy systems—and potentially replacing them. The Ripple–Circle story may not be over. But even in its rumored form, it has shifted the conversation from competition to consolidation, products to infrastructure, and speculation to system-building. And that may be the most important signal of all. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Speaking alongside leaders from VanEck and CME Group, Mitchnick explained that while retail investors dominated the early ETF inflows, institutional and wealth management clients now lead the charge. “The flows are back in a big way,” he said, adding that “every quarter, the percentage held by retail clients has gone down.” This transition underscores a broader adoption cycle—one driven less by hype and more by portfolio strategy. According to BlackRock executives, institutions are increasingly viewing BTC as a macro hedge, not just a speculative asset. Bitcoin as a Safe Haven in an Uncertain Economy The rise in institutional interest appears to be fueled by rising concerns over global financial stability. BlackRock’s Jay Jacobs recently noted , “Bitcoin thrives when you have more uncertainty.” With U.S. GDP contracting 0.3% in Q1 and inflation moderating, investors are hedging against long-term currency debasement and geopolitical instability.

While such projections remain speculative, they highlight Bitcoin’s growing role as a non-sovereign store of value, especially in times of macro stress. Key drivers supporting Bitcoin’s appeal: Institutional reallocation amid rate uncertainty Rising distrust in fiat systems Scarcity and predictable monetary policy Regulatory clarity around Bitcoin ETFs Technical Setup: BTC Eyes Breakout Toward $97K Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is trading just shy of resistance at $95,441, forming an ascending triangle pattern on the 2-hour chart—often a precursor to bullish continuation. The 50 EMA at $94,426 is providing strong support, and MACD is flipping positive. Bitcoin Price Chart Source: Tradingview Should BTC close above $95,441 with volume, the next price targets stand at $96,610 and $97,500. If bulls fail to clear resistance, support rests at $94,400, which also marks a prudent stop-loss level. Trade Setup: Entry: Break and close above $95,441 Target 1: $96,610 Target 2: $97,500 Stop-loss: Below $94,400 This is a textbook breakout structure. Traders should remain patient, waiting for confirmation to avoid false breakouts—momentum favors upside as long as BTC stays above the 50 EMA. BTC Bull Token Crosses $5.2M Milestone as 80% Yield Fuels Staking Surge Investor interest in BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) remains strong, with $5.2 million raised out of a $5.9 million target.

Dubai isn’t just adopting web3 — it’s engineering the environment where it will thrive. Through a unique convergence of regulatory clarity, public-private collaboration, and a relentless drive for innovation, the Emirate is rapidly positioning itself as one of the most forward-thinking jurisdictions for digital assets and tokenized finance. You might also like: Dubai’s mirage: the city might be heaven, but not for crypto entrepreneurs | Opinion Through innovation-friendly regulatory standards and the government’s bold policy strategies, such a pro-enterprise ecosystem ensures economic sustainability, financial security, investor protection, cross-border trades, robust risk mitigation mechanisms, and industry-leading collaborations. As the city hosts global events like Token2049 and fosters industry-shaping initiatives like the ZIGChain Summit, it’s clear that the foundations being laid here will define the next generation of global financial infrastructure. Business-friendly regulatory frameworks The groundwork of Dubai’s progressive culture of innovation and pro-market stance began with initiatives like the Dubai Blockchain Strategy in 2016. Since then, programs like the Dubai Metaverse Strategy and Dubai Economic Agenda D33 aim to create over 40,000 digital-native jobs and contribute $4 billion to the economy. To do so, Dubai has built a compliant digital economy by establishing regulatory agencies like the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority. It has also built over 20 Free Zone Authorities, which support innovation-driven entrepreneurship through 100% foreign ownership, capital repatriation, and easy business setup. One of Dubai’s premier purpose-built financial free zones, the Dubai International Financial Centre, has its independent regulator, the Dubai Financial Services Authority. The DFSA is launching the Tokenization Regulatory Sandbox, a unique initiative to support companies exploring tokenized investment products and services within the DIFC. The Sandbox will include two stages. First, firms have to express interest in developing tokenized products. Second, selected firms will join the Innovation Testing License Tokenization Cohort to test their products within a controlled regulatory environment. The Regulatory Sandbox demonstrates DFSA’s commitment to supporting compliant financial products through the ITL Tokenization Cohort. The firms will get regulatory guidance and clarity on DFIC’s tokenization rules, operate in live market situations, and get a full DFIC license. Such initiatives support innovation, build confidence among industry stakeholders, and attract legacy financial players into the digital asset industry. Bridging traditional finance with digital assets Dubai’s traditional financial institutions have collaborated with digital asset companies to integrate the two sectors and offer unique financial solutions. For instance, the UAE’s Dubai Islamic Bank partnered with Crypto.com in December 2024 to promote Crypto.com’s app and card via DIB’s payment channels. The partnership will offer reward-based campaigns for DIB customers and ensure seamless crypto payments through DIB’s existing infrastructure. Further, users can fund their Crypto.com app with local fiat currency and explore real-world asset tokenization like Islamic sukuks, a Sharia law-compliant financial certificate. Musabbah Al Qaizi, Chief Digital Officer at Dubai Islamic Bank, explained: “ This collaboration…sets new-age standards for Sharia-compliant financial solutions, providing our customers with unparalleled security, efficiency, and flexibility. It empowers us to redefine the integration between Islamic banking and digital asset management .” Crypto.com has also acquired the Abu Dhabi Global Market, regulated Orion Principles Limited, launched the AED Wallet for seamless deposits and withdrawals in local currency, and collaborated with Mastercard to issue prepaid debit cards. Besides such pro-crypto collaborations from private enterprises, the government of Dubai has undertaken several initiatives to boost the tokenized economy. These initiatives help onboard more people into the digital asset industry. Pioneering tokenized real estate at scale Dubai’s real estate agency, the Dubai Land Department, launched a real estate tokenization pilot program in March 2025. The program uses blockchain to tokenize property title deeds. The project was developed with VARA and the Dubai Future Foundation through Sandbox Real Estate to make it the Middle East’s first on-chain property registration authority. Such a governmental push reflects Dubai’s ambition to emerge as a global technology and financial hub by participating in trends like RWA tokenization. DLD has projected that the tokenized real estate market could reach $16 billion by 2023, accounting for 7% of the city’s property transactions. Blockchain-based RWA tokenization enables fractional ownership and smooth property deed transfers, reducing investors’ entry barriers and enhancing market liquidity. This offers a better ownership model for property purchases, increasing transparency and easing operational hurdles in real estate projects. His Excellency Eng. Marwan Ahmed Bin Ghalita, Director General of Dubai Land Department, elaborated : “ By converting real estate assets into digital tokens recorded on blockchain technology, tokenisation simplifies and enhances buying, selling, and investment processes. This aligns perfectly with Dubai Land Department’s vision to achieve global leadership in real estate investment, leverage technology to develop innovative real estate products, and foster an ecosystem that supports real estate innovation .” No wonder Dubai offers a dynamic and expanding ecosystem for democratizing investment opportunities, aligning with its vision of a Smart City innovation hub. Incubating ideas and opportunities Dubai is rapidly emerging as a global web3 powerhouse with its future-proof regulations, innovation-friendly governance structure, strategic global location, state-of-the-art infrastructure, and outstanding logistics. The city’s innovation journey isn’t limited to policy — it’s driven by community. Events like Token2049 Dubai have become convergence points for founders, investors, and institutions exploring the future of decentralized tech. This year, over 300 side events turned the city into a live innovation lab. The momentum built in Dubai is no accident. It’s the result of an ecosystem purpose-built for scale, compliance, and impact. And for those building the next chapter of global finance — Dubai is not a destination. It’s the launchpad.

Excluding this case, losses still rose by 21%, driven by phishing and access vulnerabilities. While white hat hackers recovered $18.2 million, including full returns from the KiloEx and ZKsync incidents, the month shed some light on the growing sophistication in crypto crime. Meanwhile, the first quarter of 2025 saw a record 1.8 million token failures—nearly half of all failures since 2021. Exploiters Hit Hard in April Crypto-related losses surged dramatically in April of 2025, spiking by 1,163% compared to the previous month. This is according to a report by blockchain security firm CertiK. The firm revealed that $364 million was lost to scams, hacks, and exploits throughout the month, which is a sharp increase from the $28.8 million that was recorded in March. A single incident was largely responsible for the massive jump. It was a highly sophisticated heist targeting an elderly US individual, in which 3,520 Bitcoin were stolen. If this exceptional case is excluded, the total losses in April amount to $34 million, which still represents a 21% increase from March. The firm identified phishing scams as the top method that was used in these attacks, with social engineering, access control vulnerabilities, and price manipulation also contributing quite a bit to the total losses. Despite the alarming figures, there were some positive developments in April. White hat hackers returned around $18.2 million during the month. This includes full restitution from the KiloEx exploiter, who gave back $7.5 million just four days after the exploit that led to the decentralized exchange suspending operations. The ZKsync Association also managed to recover $5 million in stolen tokens after a security breach targeting its airdrop distribution contract. Loopscale, a DeFi protocol, was able to recover roughly half of the $5.7 million that was lost in an exploit involving its RateX PT token pricing mechanism. While April's losses were severe, February of 2025 is still the worst month for crypto losses so far this year. This is because of the staggering $1.4 billion Bybit hack attributed to North Korea’s Lazarus Group. It is still the largest crypto hack on record. In contrast, the end of 2024 saw a steady decline in losses, with December recording just $28.6 million, down from $63.8 million in November and $115.8 million in October. Elderly Investor Loses $330M The largest incident in April happened when an elderly US individual became the victim of one of the largest cryptocurrency thefts in history by losing 3,520 Bitcoin valued at approximately $330.7 million. The heist took place on April 28, 2025, and was announced by on-chain investigator ZachXBT. They described the attack as being carried out through advanced social engineering techniques. The stolen Bitcoin was quickly moved using a method known as a peel chain, where large sums are broken into smaller amounts and distributed through numerous wallets to obscure the trail. The attacker quickly laundered the Bitcoin across more than six instant exchanges and ultimately converted a lot of it into Monero, a privacy-centric cryptocurrency. This caused Monero’s price to spike by 50% to a brief high of $339. Monero’s price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) According to on-chain researcher Yehor Rudytsia from Hacken, more than 300 wallets and 20 payment services or exchanges were involved in the laundering operation. Hacken's tool, Extractor, tracked around $284 million worth of Bitcoin through these networks, which was eventually diluted to about $60 million due to repeated fund splitting and redistribution. Binance confirmed its involvement in the ongoing investigation. However, experts pointed out that efforts to freeze assets on centralized exchanges are often slowed down by bureaucratic legal procedures. The attacker also bridged a small amount of the stolen BTC to Ethereum, and deposited it into various platforms to complicate tracking even more. While some people suspected that North Korea’s Lazarus Group may have been behind the attack, ZachXBT and other analysts dismissed this theory by suggesting the methods used did not align with the group’s known patterns. The level of automation and coordination that were involved suggests this was the work of highly sophisticated, independent hackers who prepared accounts across exchanges and over-the-counter desks in advance. Post from ZackXBT (Source: X) Security experts explained that once funds are converted into Monero, they become nearly impossible to trace due to the asset’s privacy features. As a result, the chances of recovering the stolen Bitcoin are very diminished. They also advised crypto holders to use multisignature wallets, rotate keys frequently, minimize exposure to online hot wallets, and store large sums in cold wallets to better protect their assets. This incident contributes to what has already been a brutal year for crypto thefts. In the first quarter of 2025 alone, hackers stole over $1.6 billion in crypto assets. Q1 2025 Sees Record Token Failures People invested in crypto did not only lose money through exploits. A record number of crypto tokens failed in early 2025, with one in four tokens launched since 2021 going defunct in the first quarter alone, according to data from CoinGecko . The platform’s April 30 report revealed that nearly 1.8 million tokens stopped trading in Q1 2025, which is the highest number of token failures recorded in a single quarter. Since 2021, around 7 million tokens have been listed on CoinGecko’s GeckoTerminal, and over half—approximately 3.7 million—are now considered failed. CoinGecko’s research analyst Shaun Paul Lee linked this spike to broader market instability after Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration in January of 2025. Although Bitcoin surged to new highs during this period, a sharp downturn soon followed, which dragged down the broader crypto market and contributed to widespread project failures. Another major factor in the token collapse is the explosion of new tokens created via Pump.fun, a token generation platform that went live in January 2024. The tool drastically simplified the process of launching tokens, which led to a flood of meme coins and low-effort crypto projects. While this resulted in a record-breaking year for token launches in 2024, most of these projects did not survive. In fact, 98% of tokens created through Pump.fun failed to move beyond the platform’s initial bonding curve and become tradable on open markets. To put the scale of recent failures into perspective, the number of collapsed tokens in just the first quarter of 2025 represents nearly half of all recorded token failures since 2021. In comparison, the second-highest number of annual failures was recorded in 2024 at 1.3 million, while the years 2021 to 2023 saw relatively few failures. (Source: CoinGecko ) CoinGecko founder Bobby Ong said earlier in March that investor enthusiasm for meme coins has cooled, particularly after several high-profile misfires like the LIBRA token. Although Pump.fun saw a trading volume peak after the Jan. 18 launch of Trump’s meme coin, both crypto and traditional financial markets were rattled in March by Trump’s tariff threats.",News|Security,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|XMR,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-01 09:12:44

The asset has since entered a corrective phase but continues to hold higher timeframe support levels. This consolidation suggests that XRP may be stabilizing before its next directional move. The overall market sentiment is neutral to slightly bullish, as XRP remains above key Fibonacci support zones and is attempting to reclaim broken trendlines on lower timeframes. However, a lack of strong volume during the bounce from April lows keeps bullish conviction in check for now. Weekly Chart: Fibonacci Retracement Defines Long-Term Support Zones XRP price dynamics (Source: TradingView.)

The analyst, pseudonymously known as Sherpa, tells his 245,400 followers on the social media platform X that Ethereum is at a “do-or-die” level when paired against Bitcoin. According to Sherpa, Ethereum could plunge by around 58% from the current price if the major support level at around 0.01745 BTC is lost. “If you lose this area, then you go back to early 2017 levels for Ethereum…” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X Ethereum is trading at 0.01898 BTC at time of writing, down by around 88% from the all-time high reached in June of 2017. Next up is Bitcoin. The pseudonymous analyst says that over the short term, Bitcoin could enjoy a rally before undergoing a correction of up to 20% from the target price. A correction will then be followed by another rally to a higher target price later. According to Sherpa, the up and down movements in Bitcoin’s price will be correlated to those of altcoins all through. “Continued Rally until $100,000 BTC; altcoins continue to do well until then, followed by equities pulling back (currently in a lower high rally) = BTC pullback to $80,000, altcoins also pullback.

After a sharp correction of 14.06% early in the month, XRP saw a notable 20.08% surge between April 9 and 12. The price peaked at $2.3618 on April 28 but has since dropped by 3.98% since April 29, with a further 2% decline in the last 24 hours. This recent price drop has led to intense debate among analysts. Some predict XRP price crash to as low as $1.55, while others argue that the current dip is merely a shakeout before XRP embarks on its next major rally. Will XRP Price Crash in May? Crypto analyst BLOCK BULL foresees a potential drop in the XRP market, suggesting that the price may dip below $2 in the short term. His forecast comes after XRP was rejected at the top of a bull flag pattern. Since then, the market has fallen by over 8%, and BLOCK BULL predicts a further decline to as low as $1.55—an over 30% drop from the recent high. Is XRP’s Growth Potential Over? Despite the bearish outlook from some analysts, many experts, including BLOCK BULL, believe the recent downturn is only temporary. They highlight XRP’s solid fundamentals, citing Ripple’s strategic partnerships, regulatory progress, and growing institutional adoption as key factors driving long-term growth. In particular, Ripple’s recent success in halting legal proceedings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has paved the way for a permanent settlement, further bolstering XRP’s long-term outlook. XRP Price Analysis Despite the current dip, most experts see this as an ideal buying opportunity. BLOCK BULL points out that whales are using price drops to accumulate more XRP, positioning themselves for the next upward move. Another analyst, BitGuru , sees $2.15 as a crucial support level. If XRP holds above this level, it could potentially bounce back to $2.25 or even higher. Brett also believes in XRP’s long-term potential, stressing that the real value will be evident for those who hold through market fluctuations. Conclusion The consensus is clear: While XRP may experience short-term volatility, the current dip is an opportunity for long-term investors. With strong fundamentals and an improving regulatory environment, XRP’s price could see significant gains in the coming months.

The fund's design and purpose make it suitable for day trading Ether prices, but not for long-term investments. Understanding the specific purpose of investment instruments is crucial, as using them incorrectly can lead to significant losses. The Right Instrument for the Right Task Matters Any specific instrument is designed for a purpose. We acknowledge this in other areas of life—an 18-wheel semi is designed to haul freight, not to pose along Sunset like a Ferrari, even as both are internal combustion vehicles—so we should grasp the basic lesson in investing as well. Certain instruments are designed around specific problems and attributes. Therefore, we need to use those instruments—if we're going to use them at all—according to those designs. And make darn sure that we're using the appropriate investment for our own goals. 2x Ether ETF ( ETHU ) Now, crypto might not be quite the right investment to take advice from me upon. I'm the guy who insisted at Forbes back in 2011 that that's the end of bitcoin then . If you're going to go wrong, then go wrong big, is my motto. But this here isn't in fact something about crypto, or ether, not really. This is about the instrument, ETHU, and whether it can be used. If it can be, how should it be used? Fund Performance ETHU stock price (Seeking Alpha) Hmm, well, that's not good. The SA calculator doesn't seem to be working today, but that's a roughly and near 90% loss there. In, umm, a year. Under, just. So, not good. But of course, it could the that the underlying has just had a bad time: Ether price (Google) And, well, yes, that's not a good performance. But, from that peak last June, it still is only a 47% loss. One little side issue—it was only last spring that the SEC allowed ETFs to hold, or to be leveraged and track—crypto. So, as we might imagine, there was a little run-up in the crypto prices given how much ETFs were going to increase the prices of the underlying which then all so apparently, well, didn't happen. Our little lesson for the day in that grand lesson of financial markets, the efficient market's hypothesis. Information that is known is already in market prices. It is *new* information that changes market prices. That ETFs would enter crypto was known, so that was already in prices. After ETFs entered, well, the excitement fell away a bit. But that's not quite the point. A 2x bull ETF will, of course, lose more value than the price of the underlying. Which is, as I say, not quite the point. The ETF Warning The ETF promoters themselves, Volatility, say : The Fund presents different risks than other types of funds. The Fund is not suitable for all investors and should be used only by knowledgeable investors who understand the consequences of seeking daily leveraged (2x) investment results, including the impact of compounding on Fund performance. The Fund is intended to be used as a short-term trading vehicle. OK, and there's this: The Fund does not invest directly in Ether. Instead, the Fund seeks to benefit from increases in the price of Ether futures contracts for a single day. Both are important. The Effects of Volatility The first thing to grasp is that leveraged ETFs in a volatile underlying suffer from a basic problem. So basic that Seeking Alpha warns against it : For example, consider the example of a 3x leveraged ETF where the benchmark rises from 100 to 102 (+2%) on day-1, and falls from 102 back to 100 (-1.96%) on day-2. The benchmark index is back to its original level of 100, so has flat performance. For the leveraged ETF, however, the return would be negative. To illustrate, after the first day of trading, an initial $100 investment on a 3x leveraged ETF would rise to $106. $100 initial + (($100 x 2% index return) x 3) = $106 The next day the 3x leveraged ETF would drop 5.88% (3 x -1.96%), resulting in a value of only $99.77. $106 - 5.88% = $99.77 Even though the benchmark index was flat, the leveraged ETF would have resulted in a loss of -0.23% over these 2 days. $99.77 - $100 initial value = $-0.23 Even the SEC warns against it : Leveraged and inverse ETFs typically are designed to achieve their stated performance objectives on a daily basis. Some investors might invest in these ETFs with the expectation that the ETFs may meet their stated daily performance objectives over the long term as well. Investors should be aware that performance of these ETFs over a period longer than one day can differ significantly from their stated daily performance objectives and may potentially expose investors to significant and sudden losses. Now, There Are Benefits On a recent piece here it was pointed out to me—note that you readers always know more, in aggregate, than anyone writer will ever know, which is why I always advise other writers to read the damn comments on their pieces—that yes, it's true. A straight investment in the underlying will produce better results than investing in a leveraged ETF for exactly this reason. On the other hand, tax protected accounts tend not to allow leverage. So, in those, it might be worth gaining access to the leverage at the expense of the performance degrade. But do note that it depends—what it depends on is what follows. This Volatility Degradation More commonly called beta. Again, another recommendation for reading widely. This piece here at SA gives an elegant demonstration of the math here. Do read it. It's by a quant analyst with a background in computer science, so the prose isn't as sparkly and perfect as that here, but the math is a great deal better. The point to take away is that the greater the daily volatility, then the more the drift or degradation in performance produced by the leverage and the daily reset. Something that potters along in the one direction day by day hardly differs from it, something that gets to the same destination but with a great deal of volatility along the way will suffer horribly. Crypto is volatile on a daily basis. Leveraged ETFs on crypto are not the way to follow along in the medium to long term. Despite the leverage/tax privilege issues. One More Thing This line: ""increases in the price of Ether futures contracts for a single day"" Any form of derivative has a time value to it. We're taking a bet on what the price will be at some point in the future. Obviously, some of the value of that bet is how long do we have in that time part of it? Equally, obviously that time value is greater the more volatile the price we've got a bet upon. Something that varies between 1,003 and 1,005 will be cheaper to buy a bet upon for a day than something that regularly goes from 80 to 120 in a day. So, volatility costs us when buying options. Which means that if we're in a fund buying options then the more volatile the underlying, then the more time value is being lost each day. This is then another problem over, ha ha, time. Finances The accounts of the fund are here . Really nothing very interesting because the important line is just: CME Ether Futures Sept 24 Contracts 1,688 Total $212,899,000 Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) 09/27/2024 $(11,164,845) So, they've bought Ether futures. Which at the balance sheet date are losing money. Well, OK. There's some cash, some short-term Treasuries and those futures positions. Not wholly interesting. Or, in more detail : ETHU holdings (Volatility Shares) As of yesterday, NAV was just off the above share price at $32.53. It doesn't vary far from NAV. Which is as it should be, of course. The spread's not bad either: ""Median 30 Day Spread 0.20%"" That's OK in a trading instrument. The total fund size is some $420 million or so (either AUM or market value they're so close) so we'd be—as the private investors we are—be able to move in or out in what would be to us size. So, pretty good in one sense, terrible in another. Which Is Where We Come Back to Instrument Design There's nothing wrong with ETHU. As long as we're using it for its designed purpose. Which the promoter, Volatility, has already told us. This is for day trading of the Ether price. It is not for a long-term hold. The very volatility of the Ether price itself (plus that achievement of the leverage through futures) means that the capital decay over time is simply too much for it to be used that way. So, if we've a position in Ether that we want to hedge, or perhaps we simply want to speculate—with leverage—on the Ether price that day, then ETHU is just fine to do that with. It's what it is designed for, it's what it's meant for. But that exact design is what it's not suited to long-term holdings. Ether itself is too volatile for a leveraged ETF to make sense as a holding vehicle. Why Am I Wrong? In the idea that we should use instruments according to their construction, I'm not. It could also be that Ether sets off on a one direction tear without volatility, in which case the leveraged nature could make more sense. But without that, it's just not the right vehicle for long-term holdings. My Opinion Well, given what I'm on record as saying about Bitcoin (hey, go big when you go wrong) tomorrow's direction of Ether isn't, perhaps, what I should advise upon. But again, that's part of the point here. Ether is highly volatile on a daily and weekly basis. Which is what makes a leveraged speculative tool interesting, obviously enough. It's also what makes advice about which way it's going to go impossible to give. As a tool, ETHU is just fine at what it claims to do. Give 2x the daily bull Ether return. Now, whether we want to be in Ether, or bull or bear tomorrow, well, that's another thing.",ETHU,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-05-01 09:18:43

Despite an 8.6% drop in Q1 revenue compared to the previous quarter, the trading platform managed to exceed Wall Street expectations, reporting $927 million in total revenue. Zacks analyst estimates were surpassed by over 3%, indicating that even amid shifting market conditions, Robinhood continues to hold its ground. The standout disappointment was crypto. Revenue from crypto trading plunged nearly 30% to $252 million, reflecting a sharp cooldown from Q4’s record-setting highs. The broader crypto market wasn’t spared either, as the Trump administration’s new tariffs helped trigger an 18% decline in market capitalization across the sector during the quarter. Crypto trading volume on Robinhood fell by 35%, with a 10% drop in customer trades and a 27% decrease in average notional volume per trade. But in context, there’s a silver lining: crypto revenue still doubled from the same quarter a year ago, and overall trading volumes rose 28% year-on-year. CEO Vladimir Tenev downplayed short-term volatility, noting that Robinhood is prioritizing long-term market share over quarterly fluctuations. His confidence appears to have struck a chord—shares rose 1.51% in after-hours trading, reaching $49.85 following the earnings release. Strategic Moves Robinhood also announced a $500 million expansion of its share buyback program, now totaling $1.5 billion. The move, which has already seen $667 million worth of shares repurchased, is aimed at bolstering investor confidence and reinforcing the firm’s long-term outlook. Meanwhile, regulatory clouds appear to be parting. The SEC concluded its investigation into Robinhood’s crypto arm in February, removing a lingering source of uncertainty. Perhaps more importantly, the firm’s $200 million acquisition of crypto exchange Bitstamp is still on track for regulatory approval, expected by mid-2025. If greenlit, the acquisition will mark its formal entry into institutional crypto services—an ambitious leap that could redefine its market positioning. Tokenization: Next Frontier for Robinhood Looking ahead, Robinhood is placing its biggest bet on crypto tokenization. Tenev believes the tokenization of private equities represents a “huge unlock” for both investors and companies, promising faster, more transparent secondary market transactions. The company envisions a future where anyone could buy tokenized shares of giants like OpenAI or SpaceX within minutes. “This is our primary policy goal in Washington,” said Tenev. “Unlocking economic value through tokenization could be a game-changer for U.S. crypto.” The post Robinhood Stays Afloat Despite Crypto Slump, Bets Big on Tokenization Future appeared first on TheCoinrise.com .",Finance and Business News|Robinhood|Robinhood revenue,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'The Coin Rise', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecoinrise.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecoinrise,2025-05-01 09:20:08

Thanks to the cryptocurrency market being choppy after President Donald Trump’s return to the White House, and especially after the Liberation Day announcement, instances of traders rapidly achieving three or four-figure returns on digital assets have become somewhat scarce in 2025. Late on April 30, one cryptocurrency investor broke the lull by executing a well-timed buy of $1,513 worth of the Solana ( SOL ) based meme coin New XAI gork (GORK). Within approximately 5 hours, the investment exploded in value, ensuring the trader’s 7.24 million GORK was worth nearly $300,000. Soon after, the crypto trader sold 3.86 million of the meme coin, making just under $133,000. They, simultaneously, retained 3.38 million GORK, bringing their unrealized gains to approximately $162,000, per the data Finbold retrieved on May 1 from GMGN. The staggeringly successful trade was made possible by GORK’s sudden and dramatic rally that came after the cryptocurrency exchange Moonshot decided to list the meme coin. GORK is one of the many meme coin paying tribute – and, arguably, attempting to take advantage of – xAI’s Grok artificial intelligence ( AI ) model. GORK price chart. Source: DEXTools A return to meme coin mania? Simultaneously, the digital asset maneuver marks a return to the typo of trades that have become relatively rare in 2025, especially when compared to 2024 which featured investors – either through luck, skill, or insider access – using meme coins to turn hundreds or thousands of dollars into tens of thousands or millions within hours or days. The biggest similar trade of the current year has been the controversial activity surrounding the launch of several ‘official’ Trump-family-themed digital assets shortly before the inauguration. The trading was contentious primarily because many of the tokens had a significantly shorter lockup period than the main Official Trump ( TRUMP ), allowing insiders to take advantage of the pump to their own benefit.

Dogecoin seems to face stiff competition from Mutuum Finance (MUTM) which gains spotlight through its successful presale phases. The market movement creates room to assess these assets. Dogecoin’s Uphill Climb Dogecoin jumps forward from its previous price low of $0.1316 as it displays fresh market robustness. Its two bullish candlesticks on the 5-day chart hint at a potential 279% jump to $0.6533 per Marks’ analysis. The previous breakout led to a 500% rally in historical price patterns that back up this evaluation. Still the $0.20 barrier looms large. The price needs strong market demand to surpass $90,000 as Bitcoin holds above $90,000. The 100x growth target for Dogecoin becomes improbable when market tailwinds become extinguished. Due to its speculative risk investors search for practical alternatives instead of Dogecoin. The desire to understand has naturally resulted in projects such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) which launch due to their foundational value. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale The fourth phase of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale offers tokens at $0.025 while creating intense market excitement. The project demonstrates relentless growth through $7.3 million in funding and acquisition of more than 9,200 holders. The next phase 5 presale opening will increase MUTM token value by 20% to $0.03 which will generate a beneficial impact for existing buyers. Investors can expect up to 9,900% profit when Mutuum Finance (MUTM) reaches a listing price of $0.06 after securing a 140% return on the current $0.025 token buying price. Recent team decisions introduced a ranking dashboard for the top 50 holders where participants earn bonus tokens based on their position which results in deep competitive competition. Investors show increasing sense of urgency because phase 4 is approaching its selling capacity. Security and Innovation at Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) strengthens trust by subjecting its smart contract to auditors from Certik. After the finalization they will launch the news throughout their social networks to reinforce confidence in the community. The DeFi lending features of the project together with its focus on liquidity and passive income mark it apart from speculative cryptocurrencies including Dogecoin. Through its distribution process Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has created a consistent market demand that attracts investors who prefer long-term investments. MUTM stands out from Dogecoin by aligning with a structured approach while Dogecoin depends entirely on market forces hence MUTM appears as a strong selection option. Market investors hurry to obtain tokens because they expect future price appreciation. Traders’ New Horizon Dogecoin operates with a fragile market mechanism to reach 100x while Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides predictable high returns to investors. Meme coin enthusiasts perceive $1.25 as an attractive price goal for 2025 yet this expectation remains unstable due to Bitcoin’s market course. Beneficiaries of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gain transparency from tokenomics that incorporates practical application and experienced 140% value growth initially with potential to reach 9,900% post-consultation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents traders with an opportunity through its presale that rings as a powerful warning.

According to data from crypto.news, Virtuals Protocol ( VIRTUAL ) surged to an intraday high of $1.67 on the morning of May 1, extending its gains to nearly 300% from last month’s low. As of press time, its market cap has crossed the $1 billion mark, with daily trading volume reaching nearly $600 million, a 60% increase from the previous day. Today’s surge adds fuel to a rally that kicked off back on April 25, when VIRTUAL finally broke out of the $0.40–$0.80 range, where it had been consolidating since mid-March. Since pushing past that consolidation zone, the price has more than doubled, gaining over 100%. The breakout follows a multi-month downtrend that began after the token hit an all-time high of $5.07 on Jan. 2. The main driver behind today’s momentum was the recent update to Genesis Launch , a new token distribution mechanism that helps bring users, devs, and AI agents into the VIRTUALS ecosystem. With the latest update , developers can now choose to auto-lock their token allocations and set clear, transparent vesting schedules, all of which are visible to users. Per a company announcement, this makes it easier for users to assess which projects carry less risk and are worth backing, giving the whole ecosystem a stronger sense of credibility. You might also like: VIRTUAL price wakes up as post-breakout momentum builds, eyes $4 next Another key catalyst driving VIRUAL’s gains was the recent listing of the token on crypto Binance.US . Listings on major exchanges typically tend to drive renewed investor interest and liquidity, drawing in both retail and institutional buyers. The ongoing surge was accompanied by an uptick in futures open interest, which just hit a three-month high of $186 million, way up from $39 million this time last month per CoinGlass data . Rising open interest often signals growing demand and speculative activity from traders. Meanwhile, its social sentiment has remained positive for the past four days, and the number of holders with 10,000 to 1 million VIRTUAL tokens has increased over the last two days, indicating more demand among mid-to-large holders. VIRTUAL price analysis On the daily USDT chart, VIRTUAL is currently trading inside an ascending channel pattern. A break above this channel could open the door to more upside ahead. VIRTUAL price, 50-day and 200-day EMA — May 1 | Source: cryp t o.news Also, the 20-day EMA (blue) has recently crossed above the 50-day EMA (green), forming a golden cross. That’s a strong bullish signal and usually suggests a bigger uptrend is already underway. Adding to the momentum, the SuperTrend indicator has flipped green, reinforcing the positive outlook. VIRTUAL Supertrend chart — May 1 | Source: crypto.news Based on this setup, the next key target for VIRTUAL is the $2 psychological resistance level, about 48% higher than where it currently sits — a level last seen at the start of April. Traders on X also appeared optimistic about VIRTUAL’s next leg up and have set even higher targets. According to pseudonymous analyst CryptoBull_360, VIRTUAL looks poised for a major breakout above its horizontal resistance zone on the 4-hour/USDT chart, with strong daily closes above a key trendline. Source: X/CryptoBull_360 If momentum holds, bulls could be eyeing an 80–100% upside move from current levels, the analyst noted. Others, like Bitboy, also believe VIRTUAL could see more upside if it manages to hold above $1.60. At press time, VIRTUAL was exchanging hands at $1.63 per token.

On May 1, the bank launched SGB Net, a multi-currency clearing network. SGB Net enables zero-fee transfers at any time of day and aims to bypass many of the constraints associated with legacy financial infrastructure — such as the SWIFT network. ‍Network participants can also access API-powered instant fiat-to-crypto on-and-off-ramp services. “SGB Net is onboarding all participants in the global digital economy, including crypto exchanges, stablecoin issuers, market makers, OTC desks, and prime brokers,” Singapore Gulf Bank said. “SGB Net eliminates pain points in global transfers, such as long settlement times and high fees.” SGB Net also facilitates automated treasury, payroll, and vendor payout infrastructure and over-the-counter trading and will soon launch support for tokenized assets, sub-accounts, and offshore onboarding capabilities. Singapore Gulf Bank was established by the Singapore family office, Whampoa Group, and launched in November 2024. The bank is licensed by Bahrain’s central bank and predominantly services the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) and Asia markets, facilitating greater integration between the regions’ digital asset sectors. The Bahrain Economic Development Board described the firm as the “first regulated bank in Bahrain offering comprehensive crypto-compatible banking services.” “The launch of SGB marks a pivotal moment in deepening financial connectivity between MENA and Asian markets through Bahrain,” said Noor bint Ali AlKhulaif, Chief Executive of Bahrain Economic Development Board. “As the digital economy continues to grow, our kingdom will serve as a gateway connecting Asian enterprises with opportunities across traditional and digital financial markets.” Singapore Gulf Bank is bullish on stablecoins Singapore Gulf Bank also appears poised to enter the stablecoin market. In November, The Straits Times reported that Singapore Gulf Bank was seeking to raise $50 million and planned to purchase a stablecoin firm in 2025. In a January blog post, Singapore Gulf Bank described stablecoins as overcoming many of the challenges associated with legacy cross-border banking infrastructure. “Stablecoins… merge the stability of traditional currencies with blockchain efficiency to address modern transaction banking challenges,” said Jireh Chua, executive vice president of Singapore Gulf Bank. “When paired with strong risk management and institutional-grade infrastructure, stablecoins can streamline capital markets, reduce friction in global trade, and improve financial inclusion.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

44020181,https://timestabloid.com/?p=65697,1746092550,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,U.S Department of Treasury Recognizes Ripple’s RLUSD Alongside Giants like USDC and USDT,https://timestabloid.com/u-s-department-of-treasury-recognizes-ripples-rlusd-alongside-giants-like-usdc-and-usdt/,"In a significant development that marks a milestone for Ripple and its stablecoin, RLUSD, the U.S. Department of the Treasury has officially acknowledged RLUSD alongside leading stablecoins such as USDC and USDT in a recent government presentation. This recognition, recently disclosed, is being hailed as a pivotal moment by industry observers. SMQKE, a respected voice on X, spotlighted the inclusion , emphasizing the broader implications for Ripple’s growing role in the digital asset ecosystem. JUST IN: U.S Department of Treasury presentation, released 8 hours ago, acknowledges RLUSD alongside established giants like USDC and USDT. Despite being launched in late 2024, RLUSD is already receiving acknowledgment from the most influential government in the world. … pic.twitter.com/efSTMApF5c — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) April 30, 2025 Official Recognition: A Strategic Milestone for RLUSD The Treasury slide, part of a formal analysis exploring the potential consequences of stablecoin growth on the U.S. Treasury market, categorizes RLUSD among “self-reported stablecoin issuers” with disclosed reserve data. Despite launching in late 2024, RLUSD now finds itself mentioned in the same breath as Circle’s USDC and Tether’s USDT—stablecoins that have been market mainstays for years. This is not a casual inclusion; it’s a formal signal from one of the world’s most influential financial authorities that RLUSD is now part of the strategic conversation around digital dollar instruments. Stablecoin Growth and U.S. Treasury Market Impact The broader context of the presentation focused on how stablecoins, especially those backed by short-duration Treasury assets, are impacting market dynamics. As the report highlights, stablecoins now hold over $120 billion in total market capitalization, and their collective allocation toward Treasury bills, especially those under 1-year maturity, is growing rapidly. Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC) already command tens of billions in combined reserves, with substantial exposure to the Treasury market. The report projects this influence will only increase as tokenized money market funds (MMFs) and stablecoins become more attractive to both institutional and retail investors. From Newcomer to Economic Actor What’s particularly notable about RLUSD’s mention is that it enters this narrative not merely as a speculative token, but as a reserve-backed stablecoin already considered in market stress scenarios. According to the Treasury’s framework, RLUSD, like its more established counterparts, contributes to the demand for short-term U.S. government debt and is part of a broader shift in liquidity sourcing for digital financial products. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This inclusion speaks volumes about Ripple’s strategic positioning. RLUSD is issued directly by Ripple and is natively integrated with both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum. Its infrastructure leverages Ripple’s compliance-first approach, especially significant in a market environment where regulatory approval is becoming a key differentiator. The Treasury’s recognition suggests that RLUSD is not just technically compliant, but economically significant enough to be factored into federal-level financial impact assessments. Ripple’s Expanding Influence in Global Finance This development also underscores the growing institutional acknowledgment of Ripple as a systemically relevant player in global finance. Ripple’s expanding suite of services—ranging from cross-border payments and CBDC infrastructure to stablecoins—places it at the nexus of blockchain innovation and traditional finance. RLUSD’s inclusion by the Treasury reinforces this trajectory and could shape future policy discussions about the role of private stablecoins in the U.S. economy. A Turning Point in Financial Policy SMQKE’s timely analysis captures the significance of this shift. As he noted, the fact that a stablecoin launched less than a year ago is already being evaluated by the Treasury alongside dominant issuers is not just unusual—it’s historic. It validates Ripple’s long-standing strategy of building compliant, institutional-grade products capable of integrating with global financial systems. RLUSD and the Future of Digital Money In a time when the line between crypto and mainstream finance is becoming increasingly blurred, the U.S. Treasury’s formal recognition of RLUSD sets a new precedent. Ripple is no longer just a blockchain firm offering payment solutions— it is becoming part of the architecture of modern finance . RLUSD, once seen as a newcomer, is now officially one of the pillars shaping the future of digital money. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

U.S. GDP data was released on Wednesday, and a 0.3% contraction was initially taken badly by markets, but by the end of the day, and into Thursday morning, all losses had been reversed. Sharp contraction in US GDP Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), a combination of increased imports (as businesses raced to get in front of the impending tariffs) and decreased government spending, led to the sharp contraction in GDP, from 2.4% in Q4 2024, to -0.3% in Q1 of 2025. Stocks and Bitcoin fall and recover in quick order To begin with, the market reaction saw the S&P 500 fall to 5,432 points, while Bitcoin (BTC) fell to $93,000. However, by the end of the day, the S&P 500 had recovered to end the day slightly up at 5,568 points, and Bitcoin recovered to $94,200, before settling back at the $95,000 resistance level early on Thursday. What probably needs to be taken into account here, especially for longer term investors, is that all the noise associated with the US global tariffs war can accelerate and decelerate in volume over the short to medium term time scale, but over the longer term, markets are going to be pricing in the arrival of increasing global liquidity. Whichever way things go, global liquidity has to rise and this should have the effect of pushing asset prices higher. $BTC price approaches top of ascending triangle Source: TradingView The short-term price action for $BTC shows the wick down below the ascending triangle, where traders might have thought that the price was about to break down. This did not happen, and $BTC was quickly bought back up. The 4, 8, 12 hour Stochastic RSIs have all reset to the bottom, and as they climb back up the momentum could take the price out of the top of the ascending triangle. $BTC at 0.618 Fibonacci resistance Source: TradingView The daily chart displays the falling wedge pattern that the $BTC price has recently escaped from. This wedge pattern is a continuation of the upside movement from the previous massive bull flag, and the current pennant formation (ascending triangle) is also a continuation pattern. Putting aside support and resistance levels, the Fibonacci levels are displaying support at the 0.5, and resistance at the 0.618. If this resistance can be overcome, the path should be clear for the $BTC price to rise to the 0.786 Fibonacci at $102,000. Weekly, 2-week, and monthly charts all bullish for $BTC Source: TradingView While the weekly and 2-weekly price charts for $BTC look extremely bullish, this is even the case when zooming right out into the monthly chart. Not only can the price be seen to be currently confirming above the falling wedge structure, but the two indicators at the bottom of the chart are also very bullish. Firstly, the Stochastic RSI is displaying that the indicators are shaping up for a bullish cross. Combined with the week, and 2-week Stochastic RSI’s, which are also angled upward from the bottom, this can bring huge upside price momentum. The Relative Strength Indicator at the very bottom of the chart is also posturing to make a cross up. Investors need to let go of the ‘disbelief’ phase Nervous markets that have not long ago experienced some quite heavy downside price action can take a little while to move out of the ‘disbelief’ phase and into ‘hope’. After ‘hope’ follow ‘optimism’, ‘belief’, and ‘euphoria’. Is Bitcoin about to follow this traditional cycle that could take it much, much higher?

Can Ethereum Researcher Dankrad’s 100x Plan Save It? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethereum could face big problems if it doesn’t grow fast enough. Dankrad Feist, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, warns that the network might become less important in the next 5 to 10 years unless something changes. To solve this, Feist has suggested a bold plan to help Ethereum scale. Let’s see what it is? The Proposal: A 100x Scaling Plan Dankrad Feist recently proposed EIP-7938, an upgrade that would increase Ethereum’s gas limit, the part of the system that controls how many transactions can fit in each block. His goal is to boost Ethereum’s capacity by 100 times over the next four years, which would allow for far more activity on the network. Though the idea is unusual, Feist believes bold steps are necessary to save Ethereum’s future. Why Scaling Is Urgent? Feist explains that Ethereum should be the heart of crypto’s economy. But if activity spreads too much across various Layer-2 solutions, blockchains built on top of Ethereum, it could weaken Ethereum’s position and cause it to lose value to other ecosystems. He warns that without major changes, Ethereum could end up like a background player while other blockchains take the lead. Others Are Worried Too Feist isn’t the only one raising concerns. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson recently said Ethereum could face the same fate as Myspace, a social networking website & Blackberry, the phone company that lost out to Apple and faded away. He blames “parasitic” Layer-2s for weakening Ethereum’s base. On a more hopeful note, Matt Hougan from Bitwise says Ethereum has at least “stopped digging” itself deeper into trouble. But whether it can climb out of the hole remains a big question. Can Ethereum Grow Without Losing Its Core Values? Feist is confident that Ethereum can scale up without compromising important features like security, censorship resistance, and verifiability. In other words, he believes Ethereum can grow without giving up what makes it special. Ethereum has come a long way, but if it wants to lead the next generation of crypto, it may need to take some bold and risky steps, starting now.",News,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|ZRX,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-01 09:49:09

44020752,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=718948,1746093435,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/44020752.jpeg,Elon Musk to cut Federal Reserve’s spending after $2.5B design bill surfaces,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/elon-musk-to-cut-federal-reserves-spending/,"Elon Musk said Wednesday he’s considering sending his federal efficiency unit to investigate the Federal Reserve after discovering the central bank is spending $2.5 billion on its headquarters renovation in Washington, DC. Elon made the statement inside the White House’s Roosevelt Room, where he told reporters: “Since at the end of the day, this is all taxpayer money, I think we certainly — we should definitely — look to see if indeed the Federal Reserve is spending two and a half billion dollars on their interior designer.” The renovation project, which began in 2021, has seen its costs shoot up as the Fed blamed rising prices of construction materials and labor. The total now sits at $2.5 billion. “That’s an eyebrow-raiser,” Elon added. His comments came just hours before the Wall Street Journal reported that Tesla’s board had started working with a search firm to find the company’s next CEO. Robyn Denholm, chair of Tesla, later denied the report on X, calling it “absolutely false.” Elon was in Washington to highlight his Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE, just a week after telling investors he’d spend less time in the capital and return focus to Tesla amid sliding sales and a declining stock price. He used the moment to take aim at the Fed, a private entity that doesn’t take money from Congress but instead operates using profits from assets it holds. But in recent years, the Fed has been losing money due to rising interest costs and hasn’t been able to send profits back to the Treasury. Trump’s DOGE team targets federal costs Elon’s push to examine the Fed comes as part of a broader strategy under President Donald Trump, who put him in charge of DOGE in January. Since then, his teams have gone from agency to agency looking for waste, cutting staff, closing programs, and digging through sensitive databases. The Fed, including its Board of Governors and 12 regional banks, holds confidential data about banks and monetary policy that Elon’s people could soon access. His team’s methods have drawn heavy fire. At the Social Security Administration, DOGE’s access to internal systems caused portal crashes. Critics say Elon is careless with sensitive information and uses weak security protocols. But he defended the work, saying DOGE needs the data to track down $162 billion in improper payments every year. He explained fraud thrives because government databases aren’t connected. “There’s something like 20 million people marked as alive who are not — now, most of those people were not receiving Social Security. Some of them were, but most of them were not,” Elon said . “Dead people should not be receiving unemployment insurance. They’re employed in the afterlife?” He pushed back on the surveillance accusations, calling the process simple data reconciliation. A federal appeals court on Wednesday blocked DOGE from accessing personal data at Social Security, citing Elon’s own comments that the program is a “Ponzi scheme” as proof it’s a political target of the Trump administration. DOGE trims workforce and reorganizes hiring DOGE is also shaking up the federal workforce. One of Elon’s signature efforts is the “Fork in the Road” resignation plan. It gave eligible workers a chance to resign by February and still be paid through September. Around 80,000 employees signed up. By the end of April, about three-quarters had officially left. Agencies spaced out the exits to avoid service disruptions. “You didn’t wake up one day with 100,000 people leaving the workforce. They are rolling off in a steady manner. That was by design,” said Anthony Armstrong, DOGE deputy and adviser to the Office of Personnel Management. He said many agencies have continued buyouts, calling the latest offers “rolling forks.” The second wave of volunteers is more than double the first, and Armstrong expects final numbers to reach into the “hundreds of thousands.” Though cuts have been deep, Armstrong said they’re mostly voluntary. About 80% of the reductions came from resignations and early retirement offers. Only 20,000 workers have been fired using formal layoffs, while 26,000 new hires have filled essential jobs despite an ongoing freeze. “We’ve actually hired more people than have actually been fired at this moment,” he said.

Speaking alongside World Liberty Financial’s Zach Witkoff and Tron’s Justin Sun, Eric shared how personal experiences with political backlash pushed him toward crypto. “It works really well for, you know, maybe the top 1% or the top 0.1% but it doesn’t work for the rest of the world,” he said. Eric said that once his family entered politics, he saw how fragile and weaponized the system is. “And the second you start saying something that goes against the system, they’ll cancel you, they’ll ostracize you, they’ll come after you,” he added. Crypto is Perfect Hedge: Eric Trump A real estate developer by trade, Eric explained how he came to view cryptocurrency as the perfect hedge to hard assets. “Real estate’s illiquid. It’s hard to move. It’s really only accessible, you know, at least on large scale, to kind of very few. It’s very static in terms of location.” However, Eric said crypto is liquid, borderless, and accessible. “You actually realize that cryptocurrencies become the greatest hedge in the world to kind of hard assets.” But his strongest criticism was reserved for the legacy banking system, especially the SWIFT network. “Every Friday, I’m chasing wire transfers that should be instant. Why does it take 90 days to issue a loan when you’ve been with a bank for 25 years?” Trump asked. “The SWIFT system is broken—and crypto is going to replace it.” Trump argued that big banks are stuck in the past, relying on paper forms and slow systems, while blockchain technology evolves at lightning speed. “ He also praised the U.S. dollar’s global dominance, calling it the world’s most trusted and stable currency, and positioned World Liberty Financial’s WLFI initiative as a digital extension of that trust. Eric Trump Praises UAE’s Pro-Crypto Stance Trump also had strong praise for the UAE’s pro-innovation policies. “I’ve worked in the UAE since 2006, and they always arrive at ‘yes’—quickly,” he said. “In Europe, it took seven years and millions of dollars to move one golf green because of a microscopic snail. Bureaucracy is killing countries.” Calling Europe “a lost cause” in innovation, Trump said the future belongs to countries like the U.S. and the UAE. As reported, experts claim the UAE is poised to become a key destination for crypto and stablecoin ventures seeking refuge from the European Union’s (EU) newly implemented Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. The regulatory framework, which took full effect on December 30, is creating significant challenges for crypto firms within the 27-member bloc, prompting many to consider relocating, according to industry experts. Among its stringent requirements, small stablecoin issuers must hold 30% of their reserves in low-risk EU-based commercial banks, while major players like Tether face a mandate to maintain 60% or more in similar institutions.

The initiative, unveiled at Token2049 in Dubai, is designed to support early-stage blockchain technologies, public chains, wallets, and decentralized tools critical to shaping the future of crypto infrastructure, according to a press release shared with Cointelegraph. Selection criteria for projects looking to participate in the initiative will be announced soon. “We are committed to strategic investment, focusing not just on exciting ideas and talented developers, but on initiatives with clear long-term potential,” MEXC chief operating officer Tracy Jin said. She added that the priority is to back projects capable of achieving AAA status within three to five years. Related: Binance rolls out Fund Accounts for asset managers, bridging crypto-TradFi gap MEXC fund to invest $60 million annually Jin explained that the exchange aims to invest approximately $50 to $60 million annually, depending on the availability of suitable projects and partners and the company’s strategic focus at the time. “We may accelerate the investment pace if a project aligns well with our current business priorities. Otherwise, we will proceed steadily according to the original plan.” She added that MEXC is actively exploring early-stage projects focused on blockchain networks, decentralized finance (DeFi) infrastructure, and stablecoins. She said these areas are essential for advancing crypto adoption. During a fireside chat at the Token2049 conference in Dubai on April 30, Jin emphasized that stablecoins are a key priority for MEXC due to their essential role in enabling stable pricing and trade across crypto markets. In February 2025, MEXC invested $20 million in USDe , a DeFi-native synthetic dollar from Ethena Labs, alongside a $16 million direct investment in Ethena itself. Related: Binance, KuCoin, MEXC report service issues due to AWS network interruption Projects need to prove their worth The exchange also clarified that its $300 million fund will not operate through open applications but will instead adopt a selective, invitation-only approach. According to the company, the traditional “submit a form and get funded” model no longer works in 2025. “A project that can’t make itself known or find a way to present to MEXC’s investment team is unlikely to earn our attention,” Jin said. MEXC is one of the largest crypto exchanges in terms of trading volume. Over the past 24 hours, it has ranked as the 7th largest cryptocurrency exchange by spot trading volume, processing over $3.2 billion in trades, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Is Now Close To Edge Of Greed Territory The “Fear & Greed Index” is an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the sentiment held by the average trader in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. Related Reading: Old Bitcoin Whales Resurface With $760M Move—Brace For Impact? The index determines the market mentality using the data of five factors: trading volume, market cap dominance, social media sentiment, volatility, and Google Trends. To determine this sentiment, the metric makes use of a numeric scale running from zero to hundred. All values below the 47 mark correspond to a fearful market, while those above 53 imply greed among the investors. The index being between these cutoffs naturally suggests a net neutral mentality. Besides these three main sentiments, there are also two special ones called the extreme fear and extreme greed. The former occurs under 25 and the latter above 75. Now, here is how the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index currently looks: As is visible above, the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index has a value of 56 at the moment, which means the investors as a whole share a sentiment of greed. The level of greed is only slight, however, as the metric is just three units above the neutral zone. This wasn’t the case just a week ago, when the indicator hit the 72 mark, signifying the crowd was very close to becoming extremely greedy. The uplift in sentiment earlier was a result of the asset’s recovery rally, but with the price surge stalling recently, it seems the investor optimism has waned. Below is a chart that shows how the indicator’s value has developed recently. The trend in the BTC Fear & Greed Index over the past twelve months | Source: Alternative If Bitcoin’s sideways action continues in the coming days, it’s possible that sentiment would decline into the neutral zone next. This development may not actually be so bad for the cryptocurrency. Historically, BTC and other digital assets have tended to move in a direction that’s opposite to the crowd’s expectations. The probability of such a contrary move occurring usually grows the more sure the investors become of something. This likelihood is naturally the strongest in the extreme zones, so these regions are where tops and bottoms generally occur for the market. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Demand Returning? Active Address Trend May Suggest So While BTC is in neither extreme territory right now, the fact that investor sentiment has calmed down to nearly the neutral zone may at least make sure that greed wouldn’t become the end of the price rally. It only remains to be seen how things play out for Bitcoin now. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $93,800, down over 1% in the last 24 hours.

Ethereum and Solana Lead with Consistency Ethereum (ETH) is trading near $1,750 , continuing to anchor portfolios with its combination of network maturity and expanding real-world usage. From AI applications to infrastructure growth, Ethereum remains the backbone of the broader ecosystem. Analysts are keeping their eyes on the $2,500–$2,700 zone as the next big test. Solana (SOL) holds between $145 and $150 , buoyed by continued institutional interest and rising transaction volume. After reclaiming key support levels, SOL is now targeting $180 —a breakout that could bring further acceleration and increased market share among high-performance chains. Injective and VeChain Show Rising Utility Injective (INJ) is trading around $35 , maintaining strong structure as one of the most established decentralized trading protocols. Its cross-chain capabilities and efficient architecture have earned the attention of both retail and institutional investors. While less volatile than others, INJ’s long-term trajectory remains solid. VeChain (VET) , priced at approximately $0.0352 , has shown renewed activity following recent partnerships and the launch of its B3TR Payment Card. With volume up and on-chain activity climbing, VET is slowly emerging as a low-cost contender with a growing global use case. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST!

""Bitcoin (BTC) Is Poised for an Explosive Rise! Keep an Eye on These Two Things!""",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/analysts-explain-bitcoin-btc-is-poised-for-an-explosive-rise-keep-an-eye-on-these-two-things/,"Leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced a rapid recovery in recent weeks after months of sharp decline. While BTC rose above $95,000, the total cryptocurrency market value approached $3 trillion. At this point, while Bitcoin is consolidating between $93,000 and $95,000, analysts think that BTC is preparing for an explosive rise. Analysts generally predict that prolonged consolidation and negative funding rates could lead to a strong bullish move in Bitcoin, while macroeconomic factors could also influence market sentiment. Friday's Data is Important! Speaking to Coindesk, FxPro analyst Alex Kuptsikevich said that prolonged consolidations are good for Bitcoin and set the stage for an upward breakout. Stating that Friday's non-farm payrolls and unemployment data are very important for the rise, the analyst said that a global catalyst is needed for the rise: “Such long consolidations typically build strength for further upside. The next big trigger is likely to be Friday’s labor market data. Also, over the last five days, the market has been trading in a very tight range and has shown a tendency towards shallower declines. “For a boom, global positivity is needed. If that happens, it will pave the way for a rally to $3.5 trillion.” Bullish Signals Are Increasing For Bitcoin! WOO X research head Pat Zhang also made similar predictions, saying that consolidation is preparation for Bitcoin’s rise. Zhang also stated that funding rates in BTC have been negative for the last week, and that this situation is rare and is interpreted as a bullish signal. “BTC continues to experience volatility, forming a consolidation range between $93,000 and $95,000 since April 25, and is gaining momentum for a potential breakout. “Furthermore, the average funding rate for BTC has been negative over the past week, a rare occurrence and indicative of intense whale activity and a potential rally both on and off exchanges.” Noting that in the last two years, funding rates for Bitcoin have only been negative four times, the analyst said that these were “September 19 – September 22, 2023, October 20 – October 27, 2023, August 16 – August 24, 2024, and September 10 – September 17, 2024” and that this rate should be followed. “Following these periods of negative funding rates, BTC has experienced strong bullish trends. This, supported by whale accumulation, suggests that BTC may be preparing for a potential bullish move.” *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Analysts Explain!

44022973,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=718999,1746098529,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/44022973.jpeg,Wall Street’s Morgan Stanley plans to bring crypto trading to its E*Trade platform,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/morgan-stanley-crypto-trading-to-etrade/,"Morgan Stanley is preparing to roll out crypto trading on its E*Trade platform next year, in what would be the most aggressive move yet by a big American bank to let regular people buy coins like Bitcoin and Ether. The development was reported by Bloomberg, and people at the company say it’s still early, but serious. The firm wants to partner with one or maybe even more crypto companies to handle the technical side, from custody to execution, so E*Trade customers can buy crypto directly. The project began taking shape inside Morgan Stanley late last year, when executives started pushing harder to go beyond crypto futures and ETFs. Right now, wealthy clients can already access things like Bitcoin ETFs and derivatives through the firm. But management decided that wasn’t enough. They wanted retail users to be able to buy real coins, not just products tied to them. Once the tech and partnerships are in place, E*Trade users will be able to trade crypto directly from the same platform they use for stocks and options. Trump’s crypto policies cleared the path The plan follows a major change in US crypto policy by President Donald Trump. Once in office, he signed an executive order telling regulators to support digital finance and protect individual liberty. That same day, the Securities and Exchange Commission canceled a set of rules that crypto firms said had made it hard to work with banks. A week ago, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC took things even further by dropping their 2023 warnings about crypto-related banking risks. That move was immediately praised by the Bank Policy Institute, a group that represents big lenders. In a statement, Paige Pidano Paridon, co-head of regulatory affairs at the BPI, said, “It empowers regulated financial institutions to better serve their customers safely and invest in innovative new products and services.” Before Trump returned to the White House, most big banks avoided crypto altogether. They didn’t want to get burned by hacks, scams, or another FTX-style collapse. Some banks even avoided taking deposits from crypto companies. There was also a long list of internal critics in the finance world. One of the loudest was Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase. Over the years, Jamie called Bitcoin “worthless,” “a fraud,” and even “a pet rock.” But last year, he told reporters, “I defend your right to do Bitcoin,” and JPMorgan now works with crypto exchanges like Coinbase and runs its own JPM Coin on blockchain rails. Morgan Stanley joins an active crypto offering space Morgan Stanley’s former CEO James Gorman spoke up earlier than most. Back in 2017, James said Bitcoin was “more than just a fad.” The firm still didn’t go all in at the time, but now it’s finally pushing into real trading. This would put it in direct competition with Robinhood and Coinbase, which have owned the US crypto trading space for years. Robinhood, for example, made $626 million from crypto in 2024 alone. That was 21% of its total revenue. After Trump’s win, Robinhood’s first quarter profit more than doubled. If Morgan Stanley succeeds, it could pull some of those customers away. The name brand, along with tighter regulation and security, might appeal to people who’ve been waiting for crypto to feel more legitimate. That’s bad news for existing platforms that are already losing users or fighting lawsuits. The race is getting crowded fast. After Trump won, Charles Schwab’s new CEO Rick Wurster said his company will add spot crypto trading as soon as regulations are clear. And this week, Anthony Noto, CEO of SoFi Technologies , said the firm might bring back crypto investing. SoFi pulled out of crypto in 2023 but could re-enter the market if rules stay favorable. The SEC also gave a “non-objection” to a plan by Bank of New York Mellon to custody crypto. That means the agency doesn’t see any rule-breaking in the way BNY wants to do it. Gary Gensler, who was SEC Chair under Joe Biden, said BNY had “done the legwork” to meet requirements. The bank’s still a rare case, but it shows how things are moving.

During a virtual AMA session on April 23 the founder stated that scaling difficulties and governance problems represent insurmountable obstacles for Ethereum’s survival. The creator of Cardano Hoskinson declared users are shifting toward competing platforms because Layer-2 solutions are draining Ethereum of its energy. The market prediction supports a growing popularity of the DeFi project Mutuum Finance (MUTM) while its presale continues to drive significant success with $7.3 million and 9,200 holders. The token sale has achieved significant success because investors have purchased 9,200 holders and 425 million tokens while raising $7.3 million during presale activities. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) might establish itself as an alternative solution to Ethereum. Ethereum’s looming challenges Hoskinson carries out continuous evaluation of Ethereum’s basic operational framework. The platform faces potential failure from three critical missteps including proof-of-stake system, accounting model and virtual machine implementation according to him. An increasing number of users are moving to Layer-2 networks which lead to decreased Ethereum usage and form a destructive market trend. The adoption of RISC-V by Vitalik Buterin for efficiency does not convince Charles Hoskinson. According to Hoskinson technical improvements alone do not have the power to fix Ethereum’s fundamental problems. The future of Ethereum’s existence remains under scrutiny as crypto market observers analyze its prospect for survival. New projects have capitalized on this opportunity by developing innovative solutions to fulfill DeFi requirements. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Surge The existing uncertainty in the market allows Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to capitalize. The project continues its progress through phase 4 which constitutes 11 stages of its presale during which tokens are available at $0.025 each. Numerous investors take part in buying up tokens because the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project promises 140% profit until tokens reach a listing price of 0.06 dollars. During phase 5 the token price will rise 20% to $0.03 whereas investors who bought at present will earn 20% profits when the new phase activates. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale’s success becomes undeniable because it has drawn $7.3 million investment during which 9,200 people decided to become holders. Professional analysts speculate that the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) token value will reach $2.50 following its launch which offers investors an incredible 9,900% return from its present value. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Innovative lending model The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) platform develops an advanced DeFi infrastructure. The platform provides users with a way to obtain passive income from loans which require more collateral than needed. MtTokens issued by the project reflect earning deposits which increase project value while producing time-based liquidity additions. The team introduced a new dashboard which presents the top 50 holders who receive bonus tokens when they preserve their positions on the leaderboard. Security remains a top priority because CertiK executes a smart contract audit of the system. Relying on official social platforms the project team will share results to establish greater investor confidence. A new DeFi horizon The prediction of Ethereum’s decline drives Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to establish itself as an upcoming leader in the market. Its structured tokenomics and real-world utility contrast with Ethereum’s struggles. The fourth phase of the Mutuum Finance presale presents a decreasing opportunity for investors who want to participate in the cryptocurrency market’s evolution.

Among the coins now leading discussions are Cardano (ADA) , Solana (SOL) , Aptos (APT) , and Chainlink (LINK) . With new developments and bullish sentiment building, these tokens are setting the pace for what could become a breakout quarter across the market. Cardano continues to impress with its steady pace of innovation. The platform has surpassed 130,000 smart contracts, while its Hydra scaling upgrade is moving toward more aggressive deployment. Analysts are noting increasing ecosystem activity and user growth as key signals for strong performance this year. ADA is quickly climbing back onto radar screens as investors look for value in reliable Layer-1s. Solana remains one of the most technically impressive blockchains in crypto, combining lightning-fast speeds with minimal fees. It continues to dominate in NFT issuance, retail transactions, and stablecoin settlement volume. Recent updates have improved network uptime, and developers are flocking back in. SOL is being revalued not just for hype, but for performance. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Aptos is solidifying its place as an emerging Layer-1 powerhouse. Built for security and scalability, it’s capturing attention with its clean developer tools and strong integration pipeline. The coin has seen a resurgence in community support and has recently secured high-profile visibility through real-world partnerships, signaling deeper market penetration is on the horizon. Chainlink continues to do what others can’t—serve as the critical bridge between on-chain and off-chain data. With its Oracle network supporting dozens of blockchains, Chainlink’s relevance keeps expanding. The rollout of Chainlink Functions is unlocking new use cases across DeFi, gaming, and enterprise solutions, making LINK a staple in long-term crypto portfolios. Why Everyone’s Talking About MAGACOINFINANCE Right Now Momentum doesn’t lie—and MAGACOINFINANCE is picking up speed in a way that’s hard to ignore. Crypto circles are already referring to it as the “early-stage standout” of the year. But it’s not just hype—it’s execution. The brand is gaining visibility, the community is expanding rapidly, and traders who understand timing know exactly what this moment could mean. It’s rare to find a project that hasn’t exploded yet but is already building the kind of presence that hints at serious upside. The best opportunities often appear quiet before they break loud—and MAGACOINFINANCE is sitting right at that inflection point. For those with an eye on early narratives, this one deserves a closer look. Final Thoughts With strong fundamentals and major updates fueling momentum, Cardano , Solana , Aptos , and Chainlink are gaining strength across key sectors of the crypto market. But for investors open to spotting early movers with long-term upside, MAGACOINFINANCE is carving out a path that could become one of 2025’s defining stories.

In a letter sent on April 30 to SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, the Crypto Council for Innovation’s Proof of Stake Alliance (POSA) insisted that staking is a technical mechanism—not an investment vehicle—and should be treated accordingly. Staking is Infrastructure, Not Investment, Say Advocates “Staking isn’t niche—it’s the backbone of the decentralized internet,” the letter read, emphasizing that staking plays a crucial role in securing blockchain networks and should not be misclassified under the Howey test, the standard the SEC uses to determine what constitutes a security. The group stressed that users who stake tokens maintain ownership of their assets, and that reward outcomes are determined by code, not by managerial effort. The letter comes in response to the SEC’s request for public comment on whether staking, including liquid staking, should be brought under the umbrella of federal securities law. The coalition’s message was clear: applying outdated financial disclosure frameworks to a deeply technical function could stall innovation in one of crypto’s most vital systems. SEC Should Avoid Freezing Innovation The POSA letter encouraged the SEC to take a more principles-based regulatory stance—similar to its previous handling of proof-of-work mining—rather than imposing rigid rules. The coalition argued that overregulation could freeze market structures and hinder the evolution of staking services, especially in exchange-traded products (ETPs), which could bring crypto further into mainstream finance. “In the past four months, we’ve seen more movement and constructive dialogue with the SEC than in the past four years,” the letter noted, signaling growing hope for more productive engagement between regulators and the crypto industry. The letter also pointed out that staking doesn’t generate profits through managerial oversight, unlike traditional companies. Instead, returns come from network participation, removing one of the key pillars of the Howey test definition of an investment contract. Heavyweights Back the Push for Clarity The push is backed by major names in the crypto space, including Consensys, Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), and Kraken—each of whom has a vested interest in how staking services are regulated in the U.S. Kraken, notably, resumed staking services in the country earlier this year despite a rocky regulatory backdrop. Meanwhile, anticipation continues to build for the approval of a crypto staking ETF . While the SEC recently delayed a decision on Grayscale’s Ether ETF, Bloomberg’s James Seyffart suggests a green light for staking-inclusive ETFs could come as early as May.

This recovery follows several weeks of steady gains, although the asset remains approximately 12.6% below its all-time high recorded in January. Some analysts are now focusing on underlying trends across both spot and derivatives platforms to evaluate the sustainability of the current momentum. Recent data highlights notable movements of Bitcoin away from exchanges, particularly from Coinbase, a trend that typically signals a reduced available supply and potentially reduced selling pressure. In parallel, derivatives market activity has also picked up, suggesting an increase in leveraged positioning that could support ongoing upward momentum. The convergence of both accumulation signals and growing open interest has analysts watching closely for a continuation of the rally or a breakout attempt beyond recent highs. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Demand Returning? Active Address Trend May Suggest So 8,000 Bitcoin Pulled From Coinbase Signals What? Amr Taha, a contributor on CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, recently observed that over 8,000 BTC—worth approximately $763 million—was withdrawn from Coinbase on two separate occasions within five days. This activity, visible on exchange netflow data, represents one of the largest Bitcoin outflow events recorded in recent weeks. Taha pointed out that the withdrawals occurred on April 24 and again on April 29, suggesting deliberate actions rather than random user activity. According to the analysis, large outflows from exchanges typically indicate that holders are transferring assets into cold wallets for long-term storage. This behavior often aligns with accumulation phases, as investors seek to remove their assets from trading platforms, thereby reducing immediate sell-side liquidity. Taha concluded, noting: Historically, significant Bitcoin outflows from exchanges — especially from major platforms like Coinbase — have often preceded strong bullish price movements. These outflows signal reduced immediate sell pressure and a tightening of available supply. Such dynamics have repeatedly aligned with periods of increased hedge fund activity, as institutional players reposition in anticipation of upside momentum. Binance Open Interest Climbs $2.2 Billion as Futures Activity Rebounds In a separate analysis, another CryptoQuant analyst, Burak Kesmeci, reported a surge in Binance’s Bitcoin Open Interest (OI) over the last 20 days. After declining from $11.9 billion in January to $7.5 billion in early April, a drop of nearly 37%, OI has since rebounded by 29.3%, reaching $9.7 billion. This increase in open interest corresponds with Bitcoin’s 23.7% price rise from $76,000 to over $94,000 during the same period. Rising open interest in derivatives markets typically indicates growing participation by leveraged traders and is often interpreted as a sign of increasing confidence or speculation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply in Profit Rises Above 85%— Is Euphoria Setting In? Kesmeci’s analysis suggests that the uptick in OI, when viewed alongside declining exchange reserves, may reinforce a bullish structure in the current market cycle. If momentum continues and funding conditions remain favorable, Bitcoin could push closer toward the $100K threshold in the short term.

KiloEx, Loopscale and zkSync all had funds returned by whitehat exploiters. ~$337M of the total is attributed to phishing. More… pic.twitter.com/0GBcSZgdPB — CertiK Alert (@CertiKAlert) April 30, 2025 This figure marks a 1,163% increase from March’s $28.8 million in losses. The surge, according to CertiK’s April 30 post on X, was driven primarily by a single, devastating event. The theft involved 3,520 Bitcoins, valued at $330.7 million, stolen from an elderly U.S. citizen, making it the fifth-largest crypto hack ever recorded. Though April’s total was heavily skewed by this singular event, even without it, the losses remained significant at $34 million, still up 21% from March. The most damaging threats came in the form of phishing attacks, social engineering, access control exploits, and price manipulation. Phishing and Social Engineering Phishing accounted for the lion’s share of April’s losses, approximately $337 million. The standout case was the theft from the elderly U.S. investor , where the attacker used highly advanced social engineering tactics to deceive the victim and gain access to their Bitcoin wallet. A suspected theft of 3,520 Bitcoin valued at approximately $330.7 million has triggered a sharp rally in Monero (XMR). #Bitcoin #XMR https://t.co/AXZu6RYpI4 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 28, 2025 According to CertiK, this event marks a new wave of cybercrime, where criminals bypass code and blockchain infrastructure entirely, opting instead to exploit human behavior. Social engineering, a tactic that manipulates individuals into revealing confidential information, has become one of the most effective strategies for crypto criminals. These attacks are particularly insidious because they often appear legitimate, tricking even experienced investors. April’s numbers also reflect a broader trend. CertiK’s report isn’t the only one that paints a troubling picture. Immunefi, another blockchain security firm, recorded $92 million in losses across 15 incidents in April alone . #Hackers stole more than $92.4 million from #crypto projects in April 2025, while the total loss for the first four months of the year alone surpassed $1.74 billion, according to @Immunefi . https://t.co/YECTPKFNNY — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 30, 2025 The firm also confirmed that all the attacks targeted DeFi platforms, with centralized exchanges reporting no security incidents during the month. The largest attack cited by Immunefi, on the open-source platform UPCX, led to over $70 million in damages. It was followed by the $7.5 million KiloEx exploit. White Hat Hackers Help Recover Millions Amid Mounting Threats Despite the grim numbers, April had a silver lining, as some of the stolen funds were recovered. CertiK confirmed that approximately $18.2 million was returned, thanks to the efforts of white-hat hackers and cooperative exploiters. Ethical hackers played a crucial role in helping three platforms, KiloEx , zkSync , and Loopscale , recover their losses. KiloEx, which had suspended operations following a $7.5 million exploit, saw the stolen funds returned just four days after the incident. In a rare gesture of goodwill, the attacker chose to return the funds in full. Similarly, Loopscale successfully negotiated with its attacker to recover $5.8 million after a vulnerability in its token pricing mechanism was exploited. The attacker agreed to return the funds in exchange for a 10% white hat bounty and legal immunity. Meanwhile, zkSync Association recovered $5 million in stolen tokens after its airdrop distribution contract was breached. The agreement involved a similar bounty reward. April’s spike in losses may be shocking, but it’s not isolated. Earlier in the year, February saw the costliest month to date, with crypto losses totaling $1.53 billion. The funds stolen in the Bybit hack are on the move — and investigators have a clearer idea of how the $1.4 billion in crypto was stolen #Bybit #LazarusGroup https://t.co/P9mgdDbkd1 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) February 25, 2025 The bulk of that was attributed to a $1.46 billion hack on Bybit , believed to have been orchestrated by the North Korean Lazarus Group, now considered responsible for the largest crypto heist in history. State-backed threats remain one of the most serious long-term risks to the crypto industry. Despite numerous warnings, hackers have already stolen more in 2025 than they did in the entire year of 2024. As of the end of April, over $1.7 billion in crypto has been lost, eclipsing last year’s $1.49 billion in just four months. For now, the $364 million lost in April serves as both a brutal financial hit and a dire warning. As phishing and social engineering continue to prove effective, investors are advised to remain vigilant and educate themselves on best practices to stay secure at all times .

At peak times, simple transactions can cost users more than the transaction itself. That bottleneck has slowed adoption, especially in emerging markets where affordability is key. Now, a powerful new blockchain project has entered the scene: Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S). Designed to solve Ethereum’s core limitations, including its notorious gas problem, Bitcoin Solaris is already drawing massive interest from crypto analysts and early investors who believe it could deliver 50x returns in the years ahead. Ethereum’s Impact—and Its Frustrating Flaw Ethereum made blockchain programmable and opened the doors to DeFi, NFTs, and Web3. But its congestion-prone network and expensive fees have created friction for both users and developers. Many projects have had to migrate away or build costly layer-2 solutions to remain usable. Even with the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, gas costs haven’t disappeared — just shifted. This leaves the door open for new platforms that offer: Lower transaction costs Faster finality Better scalability for real-world apps Bitcoin Solaris is stepping through that door, offering a seamless, efficient solution to the problem Ethereum still hasn’t solved. Bitcoin Solaris: Designed to Eliminate Gas Friction Bitcoin Solaris introduces a hybrid dual-layer protocol built to scale while keeping fees ultra-low — even during high traffic periods. Its design delivers the performance Ethereum lacks: Dual-Layer Architecture Base Layer (Proof-of-Work) for security Solaris Layer (Delegated Proof-of-Stake) for high-speed smart contract execution Transaction Highlights 10,000+ transactions per second (TPS) 2-second finality 99.95% less energy consumption than Ethereum or Bitcoin Zero congestion impact on fees Smart contracts and DeFi applications run on the Solaris Layer, meaning even at scale, users enjoy minimal fees and fast confirmations — solving the very issue that’s plagued Ethereum since its inception. Helios: The Engine Powering Scalable DeFi At the heart of Bitcoin Solaris’s low-fee, high-performance system is Helios — a framework that unlocks advanced decentralized finance capabilities without compromising usability. Helios enables: Instant swaps and low-slippage decentralized exchanges (DEXs) Lending and borrowing protocols with low gas and fast processing Cross-chain functionality that bridges Bitcoin Solaris with ecosystems like Solana and Ethereum Yield farming strategies with automated liquidity and rewards New Token, Familiar Strength—Meet BTC-S Today Unlike Ethereum’s expensive DeFi tools, Helios is accessible, affordable, and scalable, enabling projects and users to interact with DeFi in real time, with no prohibitive costs. Presale Live: 50x Potential for Early Participants Bitcoin Solaris is now in Presale Phase 1, and the excitement is building fast. Here’s what early buyers need to know: Current Price: $1.00 Next Phase: $2.00 Launch Price: $20.00 Potential Gain: Up to 1,900% With a fixed total supply of 21 million BTC-S, the opportunity to get in before exchange listings is narrowing — and early entry has historically been the key to outsized gains in crypto. In addition, Bitcoin Solaris active presence on X ensures users are always informed, with updates and announcements shared consistently to build trust and engagement. Double Rewards Referral Program: Earn More by Sharing To accelerate adoption, Bitcoin Solaris has introduced a dual-sided referral system during the presale: Referrers earn 5% in BTC-S tokens for each successful referral Referred users receive a 5% bonus on top of their token purchase Rewards are automatic and credited in real time How to get started: Visit bitcoinsolaris.com Log in to your account and grab your referral link Share it across social platforms or directly with friends Earn passive BTC-S while helping grow the network Conclusion Ethereum proved what was possible—but also exposed major flaws, especially high gas fees. Bitcoin Solaris delivers the solution Ethereum couldn’t, empowering users, developers, and early investors alike. With audited smart contracts , Helios-powered DeFi, mobile mining, and a community-driven referral system, Bitcoin Solaris is a full crypto ecosystem. The presale is live, the tech is working, and with real utility and adoption ahead, 50x returns may not be far off.

She told a packed room of Democratic donors that Trump’s economic mess and disregard for the Constitution were dragging the country backward. It was Kamala’s first full-on political speech since losing to Trump in 2024, and she didn’t waste a second. “It’s an agenda,” she said, “a narrow, self-serving vision of America where they punish truth tellers, favor loyalists, cash in on their power and leave everyone to fend for themselves.” Kamala delivered the speech at the Palace Hotel, speaking for Emerge America, a group that helps Democratic women run for office. She used the platform to call out Trump’s record, saying his reckless tariff decisions had created what she described as the “greatest man-made economic crisis in modern presidential history.” Kamala said the direct result has been rising costs for basic goods, tanking retirement savings, and a shaky job market. She said the country is being pushed toward “a recession” because of the same chaotic economic ideas that failed the first time. Harris slams Trump’s policies and calls for resistance Kamala’s speech came during Trump’s second run through the White House. She didn’t give any new information about her own future in politics, but she made it clear she’s still active. Her delivery was tight, focused, and aimed directly at Trump’s first 100 days back in office. Kamala accused him of defying federal court orders and gutting government programs that help people survive. This wasn’t subtle. She said Trump is retreating from US alliances while tearing down the systems meant to hold power accountable. It was her second public event in California in just a few weeks. She’s reportedly weighing whether to run for California governor next year or wait and try again for the presidency in 2028. But the speech had no mention of her next move. It stuck entirely to attacking Trump and backing the people in her party who, in her words, are “speaking with moral clarity.” She told the crowd that America’s checks and balances were “starting to buckle” under the weight of Trump’s actions. Kamala warned that the country is entering a full-blown constitutional crisis, and said Democrats need to stay united. Kamala pushed her “courage is contagious” theme again, this time saying that fear may be contagious, but so is standing up to it. “They are counting on the notion that if they can make some people afraid, it will have a chilling effect on others,” Kamala said. “What they’ve overlooked is that fear isn’t the only thing that’s contagious. Courage is contagious.” Speech raises stakes for governor’s race as party watches Kamala gave credit to Democrats like Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Cory Booker, and Chris Van Hollen for what they’ve done lately to push back against Trump. She mentioned Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez for their “Fighting Oligarchy” tour that’s been pulling in big progressive crowds. Booker got a nod for his long Senate speech, and Van Hollen for helping get Kilmar Abrego Garcia returned to the US. She said these Democrats were keeping the fight alive with “moral clarity about this moment.” She also didn’t forget to tie herself back to Emerge America. Kamala helped inspire the group when she beat a sitting San Francisco DA back in 2003. Several leaders she’s mentored came through Emerge, like Lateefah Simon, Eleni Kounalakis, and London Breed. She reminded the crowd of that connection while using the moment to push her bigger point: this fight isn’t over, and Democrats need to stay ready. Kamala reportedly got a massive standing ovation in the room. People in her hometown were on their feet. But even with that hype, nobody knows what she’s planning. She gave herself until late summer to decide whether she’ll go for the governor’s seat or maybe hold off and wait for the national stage again. People close to her allegedly think she’s leaning toward the governor’s race, especially given how often she’s been showing up around California lately. Still, not everybody’s thrilled about it. A POLITICO–UC Berkeley Citrin Center poll found that a lot of insiders have a pretty cold reaction to the idea of her running. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

44023306,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154452,1746099643,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"JPY Undervalued: UBS Sees Opportunity, Flags CAD Overvalued Risk",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/jpy-undervalued-ubs-analysis/,"In the dynamic world of global finance, understanding currency movements is key, not just for traditional traders but also for those navigating the interconnected cryptocurrency markets. Macroeconomic shifts and currency valuations can influence capital flows and market sentiment worldwide. Recently, a significant piece of research from UBS analysts has captured attention, offering a distinct view on two major currencies: the Japanese Yen (JPY) and the Canadian Dollar (CAD). Their assessment points to the JPY undervalued relative to its peers, while the CAD overvalued compared to current economic fundamentals. Why is JPY Undervalued, According to UBS? UBS analysts have put forward a compelling case for the Japanese Yen being significantly undervalued. This perspective goes against some conventional wisdom and is based on a detailed examination of various economic indicators and policy stances. Their analysis suggests that the market may not be fully appreciating the underlying strength or potential shifts within the Japanese economy and monetary policy. Several factors likely contribute to the UBS view on the JPY undervalued status: Yield Differentials: For a long time, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) has maintained ultra-low interest rates, creating a wide yield gap between Japanese government bonds and those in other major economies. This typically weakens a currency as investors seek higher returns elsewhere (the ‘carry trade’). However, UBS might be looking at potential future shifts or arguing that the current differential doesn’t justify the extent of the Yen’s weakness based on other factors. Inflation Dynamics: While Japan has historically struggled with deflation, recent global inflationary pressures have also affected the country. UBS might see the potential for inflation to become more sticky, which could pressure the BoJ to eventually adjust its monetary policy, potentially supporting the Yen. Current Account Strength: Despite trade deficits in recent periods, Japan typically runs a strong current account surplus due to significant overseas investments and income repatriation. A strong current account is fundamentally supportive of a currency’s value. Potential Policy Pivot: The market is constantly watching for signs that the BoJ might shift away from its yield curve control policy or negative interest rates. Even a hint of such a change could trigger a significant strengthening of the Yen from its current depressed levels. UBS’s view might incorporate an expectation, or at least the potential, for such a pivot sooner than the market generally anticipates. The argument for the JPY undervalued is complex, weaving together monetary policy expectations, inflation trends, and structural economic factors. UBS’s stance suggests they see a potential for appreciation that the broader Forex market might be overlooking. The Case for CAD Overvalued: What Did UBS Find? On the flip side, UBS analysts view the Canadian Dollar as overvalued. Canada’s economy is heavily influenced by commodity prices, particularly oil, and the monetary policy decisions of the Bank of Canada (BoC). UBS’s assessment indicates that the current market price of the CAD might not fully reflect potential headwinds or risks facing the Canadian economy. Reasons behind the CAD overvalued assessment likely include: Commodity Price Sensitivity: While oil prices have been volatile, their impact on the CAD is significant. UBS might be factoring in potential risks to commodity demand or supply that are not currently priced into the currency. A downturn in key commodity prices could weigh heavily on the CAD. Economic Growth Outlook: Like many economies, Canada faces potential challenges from higher interest rates and a slowing global economy. UBS may have a more cautious outlook on Canadian growth compared to the market consensus, suggesting the CAD’s current strength isn’t sustainable based on future economic activity. Bank of Canada Stance: The BoC was among the first major central banks to aggressively hike interest rates. However, expectations about future rate cuts or a pause in policy tightening could impact the CAD. UBS might believe the market is too optimistic about Canada’s ability to withstand economic slowdowns, potentially leading to earlier or deeper rate cuts than anticipated, which would pressure the CAD. Housing Market Risks: Canada’s housing market has been a significant driver of economic activity but also represents a potential vulnerability. UBS could be factoring in risks associated with high household debt and potential corrections in housing prices, which could dampen consumer spending and economic growth. The argument for the CAD overvalued centres on potential economic vulnerabilities and risks associated with commodity dependence and monetary policy expectations. UBS’s perspective suggests they see downside risk for the CAD that the Forex market might be underestimating. Navigating the Forex Market: What Does This Analysis Mean? For participants in the global financial system, including those focused on cryptocurrencies who monitor macro trends, this UBS analysis provides valuable context. Currency valuations impact international trade, investment flows, and the relative attractiveness of assets denominated in different currencies. If UBS’s forecast proves accurate, it has several implications: Investment Flows: A strengthening JPY could attract capital back to Japan, while a weakening CAD could deter investment in Canadian assets. Relative Asset Prices: The cost of acquiring assets (like stocks, bonds, or even real estate) in Japan versus Canada changes based on the exchange rate. Carry Trades: The traditional carry trade (borrowing in low-interest rate currencies like JPY to invest in higher-yielding ones) becomes less attractive or even risky if the JPY is expected to appreciate significantly. Commodity Impact: A weaker CAD could make Canadian exports cheaper but also reflects potential weakness in the commodity markets that underpin the economy. Understanding this Currency forecast is crucial for making informed decisions, whether you are directly involved in Forex trading or simply observing how global economic forces might influence other markets you participate in. Understanding Currency Valuation: More Than Just Numbers Determining whether a currency is truly JPY undervalued or CAD overvalued involves more than just looking at the spot exchange rate. Analysts use various models and indicators to assess fair value. These include: Purchasing Power Parity (PPP): Compares the price of a basket of goods in different countries to see what the exchange rate ‘should’ be to equalize purchasing power. Interest Rate Parity: Relates interest rates and forward exchange rates. Economic Fundamentals: Looking at GDP growth, inflation, employment, trade balances, and government debt. Monetary Policy Stance: The current and expected future path of interest rates and quantitative easing/tightening. Political Stability and Geopolitical Factors: These can significantly impact investor confidence and capital flows. UBS’s view is likely a synthesis of these factors, weighted by their proprietary models and expert judgment. Their conclusion that the JPY undervalued and CAD overvalued is a high-conviction call based on their specific interpretation of these complex interactions. UBS Analysis: What Are the Potential Implications? A significant call from a major institution like UBS can itself influence market dynamics. Traders and investors pay attention to such reports. If enough market participants align with the UBS analysis , it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, at least in the short to medium term. Potential Benefits (if UBS is right): Opportunities for long positions in JPY or JPY-denominated assets. Opportunities for short positions in CAD or CAD-denominated assets. Potential for diversification benefits by adjusting currency exposure. Potential Challenges/Risks (if UBS is wrong or circumstances change): The Bank of Japan could maintain its ultra-loose policy longer than expected, keeping JPY weak. Commodity prices, particularly oil, could surge unexpectedly, strengthening the CAD. Global economic conditions could evolve differently, altering growth and inflation dynamics in Japan and Canada. Unexpected geopolitical events could override fundamental currency drivers. Therefore, while the Currency forecast from UBS provides a strong directional view, it’s essential to consider the potential risks and monitor incoming data and news that could challenge their thesis. The Forex market is influenced by a myriad of factors, and even the most respected analysis is subject to uncertainty. Actionable Insights: For those looking to act on this information, potential strategies might include: Considering pairs trades like buying JPY against the CAD (long JPY/CAD). Reviewing exposure to assets denominated in JPY or CAD. Monitoring BoJ and BoC communications closely for any signs of policy shifts. Keeping an eye on commodity price trends, especially oil. It’s crucial to remember that currency trading involves risk, and leveraging positions can magnify both gains and losses. This UBS analysis should be one component of a broader research and risk management framework. In Summary: UBS analysts have presented a notable Currency forecast , highlighting the JPY undervalued and the CAD overvalued . Their perspective is based on an assessment of monetary policy, inflation, economic outlook, and other fundamental factors influencing the Forex market . This UBS analysis suggests potential opportunities for traders and investors, particularly in pairs like JPY/CAD. However, like all market forecasts, it comes with risks and is subject to changes in global economic conditions and central bank actions. Staying informed and conducting independent research is vital when navigating these complex markets.

The Google subpoena scam is a type of phishing attack where fraudsters impersonate Google to create a false sense of urgency and fear. Typically, you will receive an email that appears to come from no-reply@google.com, claiming to inform you of a subpoena, a formal legal request. The email will often have a subject line like “Security Alert” or “Notice of Subpoena,” making it seem urgent and legitimate. These scammers prey on your natural concern about legal matters and data privacy, hoping to trigger a reaction. Inside the email, the scammers falsely claim that Google has been served with a subpoena requiring the company to turn over your account data, such as emails, documents or search history. The email will then urge you to click on a link to view your “case materials.” This link typically leads to a fraudulent website, often hosted on Google Sites, which is designed to look like a genuine Google support page. This added layer of legitimacy can easily trick users into believing the request is real. The most concerning part of this scam is that attackers are skilled at spoofing Google’s email addresses and mimicking the company’s official content. By doing so, they can bypass common security checks, such as DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), which normally verifies the authenticity of an email. With this approach, the scam appears convincingly legitimate, making it easy for unsuspecting users to act impulsively — potentially exposing sensitive data or inadvertently installing malware. Did you know? DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) is an email security standard that verifies whether a message really comes from the domain it claims to be from. It uses cryptographic signatures to protect against email spoofing and phishing attacks — making your inbox just a little safer every day. How the Google subpoena scam works Software firm EasyDMARC explained that attackers exploited legitimate Google services to bypass traditional spam filters. They used “OAuth” applications combined with DKIM workarounds to create emails that could fool even careful users. A DKIM replay attack exploits the way email authentication works, specifically using DomainKeys Identified Mail, which adds a digital signature to an email to verify its authenticity. Steps of the attack: Attacker receives a legitimate Google email: The attacker intercepts a legitimate email from Google that has a valid DKIM signature, which proves it came from Google. Preparing the replay: The attacker saves this email, keeping the DKIM signature intact, and replays it. Since DKIM checks only the email headers and body (if unchanged), the attacker can forward the exact email with its signature intact without modification. Sending the spoofed email: The attacker then sends this saved email from a different account (e.g., Outlook), making it look like it’s from the original sender (Google). Relaying through other servers: The email goes through multiple servers, each adding their own DKIM signature, but the original Google DKIM signature remains untouched and valid. Final delivery: The email reaches the victim’s inbox, appearing legitimate. Despite being relayed through several servers, the email passes SPF, DKIM and DMARC checks, which makes it look like a valid Google email. The result: The victim is tricked into thinking it’s a legitimate message, potentially leading to harmful actions like clicking malicious links or providing sensitive information. This type of attack plays on the trust people place in email authentication methods and shows how attackers can exploit them. Here’s how fake Google emails and DKIM replay attacks trick you: Spoofed Google support pages: Clicking the link in the email takes you to a fake Google support page, often hosted on Google Sites, adding another layer of false credibility. The website will urge you to log in to view your “case materials.” Phishing for credentials: If you proceed, you’re asked to enter your Google username and password. Once entered, the attackers can gain full access to your account. Psychological tricks: Scammers use fear-based tactics — mentioning lawsuits, law enforcement involvement or threats of account suspension. The urgency they create is designed to make you bypass your usual caution. Did you know? Google Sites lets anyone with a Google account create websites under the trusted “sites.google.com” domain. Attackers exploit this by crafting fake login pages and phishing forms, using Google’s SSL and brand reputation to deceive users into revealing sensitive information. Key signs you’re facing a Google subpoena scam Even though the Google subpoena scam is highly sophisticated, there are still clear red flags you can look for if you know what to watch out for. By recognizing these signs, you can protect yourself from falling victim to phishing attacks : Fake or spoofed sender addresses: The first thing you should do is examine the sender’s email address carefully. Even though these scams may appear to come from a legitimate Google address, small differences in the sender’s domain or name can indicate that the email is a spoof. For instance, a Google email may have slight alterations, such as “goog1e.com” instead of “google.com,” which are often overlooked by unsuspecting users. Urgent language and threats: Scammers will often try to pressure you into acting quickly by using urgent language and threats of legal action. They may claim that your account is at risk of being suspended or that you must act immediately to avoid severe consequences. Google does not use scare tactics like this in emails. Requests for sensitive information: One of the biggest signs of a phishing attempt is a request for sensitive information, such as your Google account password, two-factor authentication (2FA) code or personal financial details. Google will never ask for this information via email. Poor grammar or formatting: While scammers have gotten better at mimicking official communication, many still make mistakes. Look for inconsistent wording, odd phrasing or formatting errors. These can often reveal a scam. Suspicious links: Before clicking any link in an email, hover over it with your mouse to preview the URL. If the link looks suspicious or unfamiliar, don’t click on it. Often, scammers use disguised URLs that lead to fake websites. Lack of proper legal process: Real subpoenas are issued through proper legal channels. They are never delivered via an email that asks for personal information or a quick action. Received a Google subpoena email? Here’s how to stay safe If you receive an email that claims to be from Google about a legal subpoena or any other suspicious notification, it’s important to remain calm and avoid reacting hastily. Phishing attacks, like the Google subpoena scam, often rely on creating a sense of urgency to trick users into making mistakes. Here’s what you should do immediately to protect your personal information and accounts: Do not click any links: Avoid interacting with the email. Don’t open attachments, click links or reply. Verify the request: Visit Google’s support site directly (not through any link in the email) and check if there are any notifications related to your account. Report the scam: In the UK, forward the suspicious email to report@phishing.gov.uk or Google’s own reporting channels, and in the US, notify the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at reportfraud.ftc.gov or forward to spam@uce.gov. Update your security settings: Immediately change your Google account password and enable 2FA or passkeys for an extra layer of protection . Contact your bank: If you shared any financial details (e.g., credit card numbers, bank account information or payment credentials), act quickly. Call your bank or financial institution using the official number on the back of your card or its verified website. Inform them of the potential scam and any compromised information. Request to monitor your account for suspicious activity, freeze or cancel affected cards, or issue new ones if necessary. Review recent transactions for unauthorized charges and dispute any fraudulent activity promptly. Report to authorities: If you believe you have fallen victim, report the incident to Action Fraud or call 101 if you’re based in the UK. File a complaint with the FTC at www.ftc.gov/complaint or report to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) at www.ic3.gov if you are based in the US. How Google notifies users about legal requests When it comes to legal requests such as subpoenas, court orders or search warrants, Google takes privacy and security seriously. The company has a strict procedure in place to ensure that requests for user data are valid, lawful and processed through proper channels. Unlike the tactics employed by scammers, Google’s approach is both transparent and secure. Here’s how the real process works when it comes to legal requests for your data: Google checks the request carefully: If law enforcement (e.g., police or court) requests your data, Google thoroughly reviews the request to ensure it’s valid and lawful. Google may notify you: Unless they’re not allowed (e.g., due to a court order), Google will let you know before sharing your information. This notice won’t come in a random email asking for your password. Official notifications only: If there’s a real legal issue, you’ll see a message in your Google Account dashboard (like in the “Security” section when you log in) or through an official Google email from a verified address, not a suspicious or random one. Did you know? Government agencies worldwide request user data from Google, but each request is carefully reviewed to ensure it complies with the law. Google shares details of these requests in its Transparency Report , and how they respond depends on whether your service provider is Google LLC (US) or Google Ireland Limited (Ireland). How to avoid falling victim to Google subpoena scams To avoid falling victim to Google subpoena scams, stay calm, avoid clicking any links or attachments, and verify any legal claims directly through Google’s official support channels. Phishing scams are constantly evolving, but you can significantly reduce your risk by following some best practices, including: Stay skeptical: Always question unexpected emails, especially those involving legal action or urgent threats. Inspect carefully: Click the dropdown next to the sender’s name to see the full email address and domain. Hover before clicking: Hover your cursor over any links to preview the URL without actually clicking. Enable 2FA: Adding an extra layer of security to your Google account can stop scammers even if they steal your password. Use advanced spam filters: Tools like spam blockers, domain verification tools (like Who.is) and secure email gateways can help flag suspicious emails. Regular security audits: Periodically review your Google Account’s security settings and connected third-party apps. Stay updated: Subscribe to trusted cybersecurity newsletters or Google’s security updates to stay informed about new threats. Educate yourself and others: Sharing knowledge about scams with friends, family and coworkers can help build a collective defense.",Google|subpoena scam,EN,0,0,FIAT|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-01 11:45:00

Krüger tells his 209,800 followers on the social media platform X that the US economy “is in the very early stages of a severe deceleration (and potential recession).” He predicts the impending economic downturn will begin to matter in June and materialize in economic data in July. Krüger also notes his preferred upside risk investment is Bitcoin ( BTC ). “Granted, I am biased, but do think that it has started to trade as a risk/gold hybrid (still more weighted towards risk) and therefore it may provide a very rare ‘tails I win, heads I win as well’ risk profile. The jury is still out. Mid-term, I do not know if the second half of the year will be a raging bull market or a crash and burn 2008 style market. Both are ironically possible. We will have to see in what direction and how aggressively Trump decides to swing. And what other measures he pushes through (e.g. tax cuts). My base case scenario is somewhere in the middle. That said, the most important thing here is that Trump has introduced a massive left tail that it would normally not exist.” The economist also cautions traders against chasing altcoins in the current environment. “There is zero reason to FOMO in a Trump 2.0 world.

Major currency pairs like USD/JPY can significantly impact global liquidity and sentiment. Today, we’re diving into a notable prediction from Citi regarding the USD JPY forecast , suggesting we should prepare for a potential correction higher. Why Citi Forecasts a USD JPY Correction Higher Citi, a major player in global finance, has put forth a view that the USD/JPY pair is likely to see a move upward, or a ‘correction higher’. This prediction isn’t pulled out of thin air; it’s based on a detailed analysis of various economic indicators and central bank policies affecting both the United States Dollar and the Japanese Yen . Here are some key factors that likely underpin Citi’s expectation: Interest Rate Differentials: The significant gap between interest rates set by the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan remains a primary driver for USD/JPY. Higher US rates generally make the dollar more attractive compared to the low-yielding Yen, creating upward pressure on the pair. Central Bank Policy Divergence: While the Fed has hinted at potential rate cuts in the future, the Bank of Japan has only recently moved away from negative rates and remains cautious about further tightening. This divergence in monetary policy trajectories supports the dollar’s strength relative to the yen. Economic Data: Strength or weakness in US and Japanese economic data (like inflation, GDP growth, employment figures) can influence currency valuations and market expectations about future central bank actions. Positive US data or weak Japanese data can bolster the case for a higher USD/JPY. Understanding the Forex Market Dynamics The Forex market , or foreign exchange market, is the largest and most liquid financial market globally. It’s where currencies are traded. The USD/JPY pair is one of the most actively traded pairs, often reflecting the economic health and monetary policy stances of the world’s largest and third-largest economies, respectively. Movements in USD/JPY are influenced by a complex interplay of factors, including: Global risk sentiment (JPY is often seen as a safe-haven currency, though this role can shift). Commodity prices (Japan is a major importer, US is a producer). Geopolitical events. Capital flows between the two countries. Citi’s view suggests that despite recent movements, the underlying fundamentals favor a stronger dollar against the yen, leading to this expected correction. What This Citi Forecast Means for Currency Trading For those involved in currency trading , a Citi forecast like this provides valuable insight. It signals a potential trading opportunity or a reason to adjust existing positions. A prediction of a ‘correction higher’ implies that after a potential dip or consolidation, the pair is expected to resume or initiate an upward trend. Consider these implications: Potential Long Positions: Traders might look for opportunities to buy USD/JPY, anticipating the upward move predicted by Citi. Risk Management: Understanding the potential for a move helps in setting stop-losses and take-profit levels. Confirmation Bias: It’s important not to rely solely on one forecast. Traders should combine this insight with their own technical and fundamental analysis. Remember, forecasts are not guarantees. The Forex market is volatile and influenced by unpredictable events. Navigating the Japanese Yen Landscape The Japanese Yen has been particularly sensitive to interest rate differentials in recent years. The Bank of Japan’s long-standing commitment to ultra-low interest rates, even as other central banks tightened policy, led to significant yen weakness. While the BoJ made a historic shift away from negative rates in March 2024, their forward guidance remains dovish, suggesting a slow and cautious approach to further policy normalization. This cautious stance contrasts with the Federal Reserve’s position, where although future rate cuts are anticipated, the timing and pace remain uncertain and dependent on inflation data. This persistent policy divergence is a core reason why analysts like those at Citi see potential for the USD/JPY to move higher, even if temporarily correcting from recent levels. Actionable Insights for Your Trading Based on the Citi forecast and the factors influencing USD/JPY, here are some actionable insights for those interested in currency trading : Monitor Key Data Releases: Keep a close eye on major economic reports from both the US (inflation, employment, retail sales) and Japan (inflation, GDP). These can significantly impact the pair. Watch Central Bank Communication: Statements and speeches from Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan officials can provide clues about future policy direction, which is critical for USD/JPY. Analyze Technical Levels: Combine fundamental analysis (like Citi’s forecast) with technical analysis. Identify key support and resistance levels on the USD/JPY chart to help time potential entries and exits. Consider Market Sentiment: Assess overall market risk appetite. A shift towards risk-off sentiment can sometimes benefit the Yen, while risk-on tends to favor the Dollar. Approaching the market with a well-rounded strategy that incorporates expert analysis, fundamental drivers, and technical signals is key. Conclusion: Preparing for the Expected Correction Citi’s prediction of a correction higher for USD/JPY highlights the ongoing influence of interest rate policies and economic fundamentals on the Forex market . While no forecast is definitive, understanding the rationale behind a major institution’s view provides valuable context for navigating the complexities of currency trading . The persistent divergence in monetary policy between the US and Japan, coupled with economic data, forms the basis for expecting a potential strengthening of the dollar against the Japanese Yen . Traders should remain vigilant, combining such insights with their own analysis and risk management strategies as they approach the market based on this Citi forecast .

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/crypto-payment-platform-mesh-announces-adding-apple-pay-support-to-enable-crypto-payments-here-are-the-details/,"Crypto payments startup Mesh is integrating Apple Pay to allow consumers to make purchases using digital assets while merchants receive payments in stablecoins, closing what the company calls the “last mile” gap in mainstream crypto adoption. Mesh Adds Apple Pay Support to Enable Crypto Payments with Stablecoins Announced during the Token2049 conference in Dubai, the new feature leverages Mesh’s proprietary SmartFunding technology that converts crypto into stablecoins at the point of sale. This eliminates the need for merchants to directly process or convert crypto, making it a seamless “plug and play” payment option accessible through Apple Pay’s familiar interface. “We believe that once crypto payments become as seamless as fiat payments, there will be nothing to stop the mass migration of global commerce to the blockchain rails,” said Mesh CEO and co-founder Bam Azizi. This feature, which allows both brick-and-mortar and online retailers to accept crypto payments without the technical complexity or regulatory burden traditionally associated with handling digital assets, is expected to be available in Q2 2025. By paying with stablecoins (cryptocurrencies pegged to fiat values), Mesh aims to make the process both stable and scalable for businesses, especially as blockchain infrastructure continues to disrupt traditional payment rails. The move places Mesh among a growing number of fintech and crypto firms that are leveraging stablecoins for commerce. Stripe has recently begun testing stablecoin tools after acquiring Bridge, and PayPal launched its own USD-backed stablecoin last year. Mesh raised $82 million in early 2025 to accelerate the development and global expansion of its stablecoin-based payment network, which underpins its newest payment offerings. *This is not investment advice.

Solana (SOL), Kaspa (KAS), and Sonic (SONIC) are among the frontrunners. $SOL rallying but heavy resistance still to come Source: TradingView Taking hold above the support at the $145 horizontal level, the $SOL price looks ready to continue going higher. While the $BTC chart might look a lot more simple and perhaps more bullish, if the $SOL bulls can get above the descending trendline, and the horizontal resistance levels at $170 and $180, it can be game-on for $SOL for the rest of this bull market. $KAS about to break back into a 2-year range Source: TradingView The $KAS price looks set to break back into the range it has generally traversed within since mid-November 2023. While this is good news for the bulls, it does reiterate the fact that the price is still only just returning to a level it surpassed back in late 2023 when the bull market was drawing towards the end of its first year. With the bull market heading towards its potential conclusion at the end of this year, $KAS bulls need to get their skates on. Nevertheless, breaking back into the range could result in the price rising back to the top at $0.19, which wouldn’t be that far away from the all-time high at just under $0.21. Breaking back above $0.106 could be the first step towards this. Clear skies above resistance for $SONIC Source: TradingView $SONIC is one of the highest performers so far on Thursday. An 18% rise earlier in the day was able to just touch and confirm the major resistance at $0.345. Since then, the price has decreased somewhat and is settling just above the $0.317 horizontal level, perhaps with a view to making another attempt at the major resistance. The interesting thing about the $SONIC price is that if the bulls can force it above this major resistance, there isn’t a lot to stop it going higher until it reaches $1.17, and then the all-time high at $1.30. Traders should keep an eye on this one. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Despite broader market volatility, DOGE has managed to consolidate above the $0.15 region and is now pressing against a descending resistance line. As May 2025 begins, technical indicators suggest that Dogecoin is approaching a decision zone, where bullish momentum could trigger a breakout, or weakness could drag the price back into previous support zones. Weekly Chart: Holding Above Critical Retracement Levels Dogecoin price dynamics (Source: TradingView.) On the weekly chart, Dogecoin has been consolidating between the 0.786 and 0.618 Fibonacci retracement levels. This range was derived from the $0.05 low to the $0.48 peak: 0.786 Fib support: $0.1475 0.618 Fib resistance: $0.2195 DOGE bounced strongly off the $0.15 zone, and recent candles show stabilization above this key retracement. If the price remains above $0.15, bulls may target $0.2195, followed by $0.27 (0.5 Fib). However, failure to hold this level could invite downside to $0.12 and $0.10, where strong historical demand exists.

The Solana price has reclaimed levels above $150, which has triggered the SUI & SEI price rally. Both the popular tokens that have been maintaining a strong ascending trend may soon trigger a breakout and reach a new ATH. SUI Price Prediction—Will it Reach $10 in 2025? SUI price is breaking out from a range-bound consolidation that it held for over a week following a 60% upswing. Despite the rise, the prices did not enter a correction phase, which indicates a strong presence of bulls who have now begun to utilize their accumulated strength. Therefore, the SUI price is not believed to maintain a healthy upswing and eventually begin a fresh bullish trend. The daily chart of SUI suggests the price is breaking out from a bull flag pattern that may further help the price to reach the local resistance close to $4. Meanwhile, the MACD shows a drop in buying pressure, which may also lead to a bearish crossover. However, the 50-day MA has triggered a bullish reversal, which hints towards a potential Golden Cross in the coming days. Therefore, the SUI price is believed to maintain a healthy ascending trend and mark a new ATH somewhere around $7. SEI Price Prediction 2025—Can Bulls Make it to $1? SEI price has initiated a strong rebound from the bottom below $0.14. The price is trying hard to maintain a constant higher high and lower low as the strength of the bulls continues to grow. However, the price has surged above a bearish pattern, which suggests the fresh upswing could be nearby, which may elevate the levels close to $0.5. As seen in the above chart, the SEI price has surged above the bearish Gaussian Channel, and hence, the channel is believed to turn bullish anytime from now. Besides, the CMF that was jammed around the average range at 0 has risen significantly, hinting towards an increase in the money flow. Therefore, the SEI price is expected to maintain a decent ascending trend and test the upper targets at $0.32, $0.40, and $0.44. After securing all the ranges, the token could enter the crucial resistance zone between $0.48 and $0.5 and a rise may trigger a bull run to a new ATH.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|TRADING|SUI|SEI,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-01 12:01:42

Ethereum Still Leads,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/could-trx-and-kaspa-match-magacoinfinance-and-xrps-2025-outlook-ethereum-still-leads/,"As investor attention shifts toward long-term potential and smart positioning, a few standout altcoins are holding firm across both price and sentiment. TRX , Kaspa (KAS) , XRP , and Ethereum (ETH) are gaining traction for their consistency and evolving technical outlooks. But beyond these well-known names, MAGACOINFINANCE is making a compelling case as a rising contender—powered by strategic momentum and increasing community support. TRX and Kaspa Move Steadily TRX is trading near $0.245 , maintaining a stable position among top 20 altcoins. While it hasn’t made major headlines recently, its consistent network performance and active user base give it long-term appeal. Many see TRX as a steady option amid more volatile assets. Kaspa (KAS) is priced around $0.10 , standing out due to its blockDAG architecture and growing recognition among proof-of-work supporters. Analysts expect upside as long as demand for fast and scalable settlement layers holds. If momentum builds, targets above $0.30 could come into play. XRP and Ethereum Hold Market Leadership XRP remains one of the most closely watched tokens, holding around $2.15 . With institutional demand increasing through futures ETF products, XRP’s structure looks poised for another major leg up if it breaks above the $2.45 resistance level. Ethereum (ETH) continues to lead the pack, trading near $1,830 with strong fundamentals backing its position. Between whale accumulation, AI platform growth, and network efficiency improvements, ETH remains the backbone of broader ecosystem strength. Forecasts suggest ETH still has plenty of room to run. CLAIM YOUR POSITION — ROI TARGET: 5000%+ MAGACOINFINANCE – Consistent Growth, Serious Momentum While many altcoins chase rapid hype cycles, MAGACOINFINANCE is advancing with precision. Its messaging, branding, and community engagement reflect a deliberate strategy focused on long-term growth rather than short-term speculation. Increasingly, early investors are seeing MAGACOINFINANCE as a high-conviction opportunity. Its current trajectory highlights what separates short-lived trends from projects that stay relevant: direction, identity, and execution. Final Thoughts Whether it’s the steady performance of TRX , the technical promise of Kaspa , the institutional strength of XRP , or the foundational dominance of Ethereum , each of these tokens plays a key role in 2025’s crypto landscape. Yet MAGACOINFINANCE is building a case of its own—quietly, confidently, and with the kind of strategic positioning that few early-stage projects ever achieve.

33767162,[object Object],1746101027,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Galaxy Digital Plans Nasdaq Listing and Metaplanet Raises $250M for its Bitcoin Strategy, Fueling Presales like BTC Bull Token",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-revival-help-presales-btc-bull-token-metaplanet-new-trend/,"Presales like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) may surge as Galaxy Digital plans a Nasdaq listing on May 16, with the shareholders’ meeting set for May 9. Mike Novogratz, Galaxy Digital CEO and founder, broke the news yesterday on Galaxy’s Newsroom, stating that the move would be ‘value enhancing to the company and our shareholders and enable us to attract a broader investor base.’ At the same time, Metaplanet aims to raise an additional $250M to fuel its 5K $BTC reserve and push it closer towards the 10K goal. What Do These News Spell for the Crypto Market? In short: good things to come. Galaxy Digital’s move comes in the broader context of quasi-generalized Bitcoin adoption, with Michael Saylor’s Strategy (MSTR) leading the pack . Strategy made its first $BTC purchase in August 2020, spending $250M for a total of 21,454 $BTC. Since then, the company has kept investing heavily in Bitcoin , such that, between 2020 and 2025, it acquired more than 553K $BTC. At the same time, Strategy’s Nasdaq stocks surged by a staggering 3,000% within this 5-year timeframe. While Strategy is the most obvious example, other companies experienced similar surges alongside Bitcoin’s meteoric rise. Bitcoin miner CleanSpark also witnessed a growth of almost 500% between 2020 and 2025 after its Nasdaq listing. Even the Nasdaq 100 recorded a boost of 1% throughout April, and is still going strong, with a 3.30% increase over the past five days. Anthony Pompiliano, founder and CEO of Professional Capital Management, called market bears ‘insane’ for obsessing over the Great Depression in such a context. Everybody is Buying Bitcoin. What Does This Say About Presales Like BTC Bull Token? Everybody has either bought, is buying, or plans to buy Bitcoin in what seems to be a complete paradigm shift. Remember the Great Crypto Crash of 2018, which many called the ‘Crypto Winter’, when Bitcoin lost more than 80% of its value? That time when names like Goldman Sachs and Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan, called Bitcoin ‘ a bubble ’ and ‘ a fraud ’? Those times are gone now. Here’s a couple of stats to prove it: Strategy bought an additional 15K $BTC on April 28, 2025, worth $1.2B, bringing its reserves up to 535,555 Bitcoins. Twenty One Capital plans to acquire 42K $BTC via a $3.6B SPAC merger. Ming Shing Group, a Hong Kong-based holding company, bought 833 $BTC during Q1 of 2025 at an average price of $89,250. Rumble announced an $17.1M investment in Bitcoin for a total of 188 tokens, marking the company’s first step into the Bitcoin market. The trend even prompted BlackRock’s CEO, Larry Fink, to state that Bitcoin may soon threaten the USD’s market supremacy . Given this context, it’s safe to say that the best altcoins on the market will follow Bitcoin’s lead and experience sustained growth during 2025 and beyond. This includes new crypto projects like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL). BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) Chases Bitcoin to $250K and Beyond BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) aims to capitalize on Bitcoin’s push to $250K. This is one of the most promising new meme coins based on the roadmap and philosophy behind it. BTC Bull Token aims to tap into Bitcoin’s fan pool and attract investors with a variety of rewards, such as: $BTC airdrops : The project offers real $BTC airdrops every time Bitcoin reaches preset price points (like $150K and $200K) Dynamic staking : The current staking rewards sit at 79%, though this will change soon as the staking pool keeps taking in new investors. $BTCBULL airdrop : A massive $BTCBULL airdrop (10% of the total supply of 21B) is scheduled for when Bitcoin hits $250K. The project also burns tokens as $BTC grows in the charts, with several token burn events set at specific Bitcoin price milestones ($125K, $175K, $225K). This helps create upward price pressure for $BTCBULL, contributing to the coin’s price potential in the long term. The presale is currently at $5.2M, with $BTCBULL standing at $0.00249. If you want to join the presale, remember that you only qualify for the $BTC airdrops if you keep your $BTCBULL in Best Wallet . Check our ‘ how to buy $BTCBULL ’ guide today and read our $BTCBULL price prediction for a clearer outlook on the project’s potential. Is This the Right Time to Invest? All evidence points to a positive answer. Bitcoin is enjoying more and more public adoption, fueling its growth and dragging presales like BTC Bull Token along for the ride. Galaxy Digital’s Nasdaq listing will most likely push the company’s stocks to heights it hasn’t seen yet, and we’re here for the ride. As already stated, we don’t offer financial advice.

As part of BNB Chain’s broader “AI First” strategy , MCP empowers builders to build intelligent, context-aware applications by bridging blockchain data and AI models through a standardized interface. MCP is emerging as a universal interface, similar to a USB port, for AI to interact with external tools. It solves the challenge of context management, a critical issue in building secure, intelligent Web3 agents. Developers no longer need to build custom wrappers or integrations for each tool or dataset and instead, they can plug into a standardized, secure framework designed for Web3 and AI co-evolution. Key Advantages of MCP: Data Privacy Protection – Sensitive information is handled using secure, privacy-aware mechanisms. On-Chain Interaction Auditing – Full traceability and transparency of AI agent actions onchain. Model Protection & Encryption – Ensures the integrity and confidentiality of AI models. AML/KYC Integration – Enables compliance through privacy-conscious authentication tools. This release aligns with several key BNB Chain ecosystem initiatives and AI-first focus. These include the BNB AI Hackathon , a global rolling-format competition that fosters the development of real-world AI and Web3 applications, with past participants like Tutorial Agent achieving listings on major centralized exchanges. It also ties into BNB Chain’s official AI Agent Solution , which offers developers access to toolkits, launch support, and the opportunity to accelerate growth through the AI Fast Track Program. Additionally, the Most Valuable Builder (MVB) Program , BNB Chain’s flagship incubator that operates with an AI-first focus, providing funding, mentorship, and go-to-market resources to promising projects. Developers can engage with the code by visiting the official BNB Chain repository on GitHub to follow progress, explore the implementation, and consider contributing.

The Tesla CEO has blasted The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) for publishing what he called a “deliberately false” article claiming Tesla’s board is looking to replace him as CEO. In a fiery post on X, Musk called it an “EXTREMELY SERIOUS ETHICS VIOLATION,” accusing WSJ of ignoring a direct denial from Tesla’s board. The report suggested that concerns over Musk’s political involvement and divided attention across his ventures pushed the board to seek a new CEO. Tesla’s board chair, Robyn Denholm, didn’t waste time firing back. Posting from Tesla’s official X account, she stated clearly that the board has not contacted any recruiters and fully supports Musk’s leadership. It is an EXTREMELY BAD BREACH OF ETHICS that the @WSJ would publish a DELIBERATELY FALSE ARTICLE and fail to include an unequivocal denial beforehand by the Tesla board of directors! https://t.co/9xdypLGg3c — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 1, 2025 Why Is This Report Coming Out Now? The WSJ report dropped just as Musk faces fresh criticism over his political ties – specifically his advisory role in Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Critics argue that Musk’s involvement in the Trump administration has hurt Tesla’s image, especially in international markets. Meanwhile, Tesla’s Q1 numbers haven’t helped the narrative: Profits dropped 71% in the first quarter Market value fell by over $800 billion since the start of the year Tesla Stays Bullish on Bitcoin Despite the rocky earnings, Tesla didn’t sell its Bitcoin . The company’s crypto holdings dropped from $1.076 billion to $951 million in Q1 2025, right in line with Bitcoin’s 11.56% price dip to $82,514. Also Read: How Elon Musk’s Tesla and Bitcoin Investments are Dominating Global Markets Crypto Leaders Join the Backlash Musk isn’t the only one calling out WSJ. Big names in crypto have been doing the same. On April 12, Binance’s former CEO, Changpeng Zhao (CZ) , slammed a WSJ report that claimed he agreed to testify against Tron’s Justin Sun as part of a DOJ deal. “WSJ is really TRYING here. They seem to have forgotten who went to prison and who didn’t,” Zhao wrote in an April 12 X post. “People who become gov witnesses don’t go to prison. They are protected. I heard someone paid WSJ employees to smear me.” And this isn’t new. Back in March 2023, Tether also rejected a WSJ article accusing it of using fake documents and shell companies to keep banking access. Tether called the claims “stale,” “inaccurate,” and “misleading.” It’s Bigger Than Just Elon This goes beyond one headline. Musk and major crypto players are pushing back hard against what they say is biased, agenda-driven reporting by legacy financial media. With Musk now balancing Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, and the recently merged X and xAI – while advising DOGE remotely – there’s more scrutiny than ever.

The company intends to increase its holdings to 10,000 Bitcoin by the end of 2025, with a long-term goal of 21,000 Bitcoin by 2026. With this, the company will own roughly 1% of all Bitcoin. Metaplanet holds 5,000 BTC as of its most recent filing on Apr. 24, which is already half of its 2025 target. A crucial performance indicator, its Bitcoin yield, has also increased significantly, reaching 13% so far this year. To support its Bitcoin treasury strategy, the company has used a variety of financing techniques, such as equity raises, stock acquisition rights, and zero-coupon bonds. Most recently, it announced the full exercise of its 14th Series Stock Acquisition Rights and a partial early redemption of its 11th Series Bonds. Already Asia’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder, the U.S. expansion is seen as a bold step in spreading its global footprint.

Institutional capital is yet to enter the RWA market , and it will take some time for institutions to see its value, Yin told Cointelegraph on the sidelines of Token2049 in Dubai. “These things move incredibly slowly, you have to show value, you have to show adoption first,” Yin said, comparing RWA’s currently developing stages with the early days of Bitcoin ( BTC ) and stablecoins . “Only now, 10 years later, are they beginning to think about using the stablecoin. The same thing is going to happen in tokenized assets or tokenization,” Yin said. Tokenized RWAs are far smaller than $21 billion Yin questioned the accuracy of existing market estimates, which suggest the RWA sector is worth more than $21 billion. “I tend to think that one, all the data is wrong, and two, the perspective that most people have is wrong with this, which is I take this $21 billion in assets,” Yin said. According to the exec, the real RWA market cap figure is “more like” $10 billion, mostly including Treasury bills and gold, and just a “bit of private credit.” Total RWA market chart and main components as of April 27, 2025. Source: RWA.xyz RWA.xyz suggests that the total market capitalization of the RWA market amounted to roughly $17.4 billion as of April 27, with private credit accounting for almost 60% of all RWAs, while Treasury’s and commodities share was 27% and 8%, respectively. Private credit is not the main driver for RWAs Estimating the size of the global RWA market is extremely difficult, especially on the private side, where data is “fragmented and often inaccessible,” Stobox co-founder Ross Shemeliak told Cointelegraph. According to Stobox’s estimations, tokenized Treasurys and bonds must account for the majority of RWAs today, or between 60–65%. Stobox’s estimations of the RWA market. Source: Stobox “Crucially, 99.9% of all companies in the world are private, and nearly all of them are untapped candidates for tokenization,” Shemeliak said, adding that such companies typically struggle with access to capital and liquidity. “Tokenization provides an entirely new mechanism for fundraising, investor engagement, and cap table transparency,” he noted. Institutions are here for the money Plume CEO Yin highlighted the nature of institutional capital, which tends to move in while markets reach a bigger scale in order to make some money. “I think people tend to forget what's going on with institutions and the real world,” Yin said. “So the reason why tokenized assets are interesting to them is because they are looking for an angle to make more money, not to save money, not to do efficiency.” Plume CEO Chris Yin at Token2049 in Dubai. Source: Plume “Nobody cares about that, especially Larry Fink, who runs a $12 trillion asset manager,” Yin said, adding that BlackRock’s money market fund has been successful, but its $2.5 billion assets are tiny given the company’s net assets. Related: Deloitte predicts $4T tokenized real estate on blockchain by 2035 With the current modest size of the RWA market, the industry should currently rely more on the native community, Yin said, adding: “There are zero institutions putting money onchain. They are trying to actually suck money out of the ecosystem. Their products try to sell new things to crypto. Not putting money here.” “Yes, RWA tokenization is small today, just like Bitcoin was in 2013,” Stobox’s Shemeliak admitted. However, tokenized assets are “fundamentally institutional from day one” as they provide regulated securities, yield-bearing instruments, and financial contracts that require legal compliance and governance. “Tokenizing RWAs without institutional involvement is like trying to build a stock exchange without regulators, custodians or settlement layers,” he said, adding: “The innovation may start with startups and Web3 protocols, but for serious volume, you need institutions, fund managers, underwriters, legal advisors, and regulated platforms.” Magazine: Ethereum is destroying the competition in the $16.1T TradFi tokenization race",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-01 12:15:40

This big U.S. bank is working on a plan that could let everyday people trade real cryptocurrencies through its E*Trade platform. So, what’s happening? Let’s break it down. Morgan Stanley’s Big Crypto Plan Morgan Stanley is planning to let users buy and sell real cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether directly on its E*Trade platform. Until now, Morgan Stanley only offered crypto-related products like ETFs and futures to its wealthier clients. But the goal is to open it up to regular users next year. Instead of giving people crypto exposure, it wants to give them the real thing, actual coins like Bitcoin and Ether. The bank is still building the system and may partner with one or more crypto companies to make this happen. Once it’s ready, people will be able to trade crypto the same way they trade stocks, easily and in one place. Why Now? What’s Changed? This shift didn’t happen overnight, it follows a massive change in U.S. crypto policy under President Donald Trump. His administration issued executive orders to support digital assets, rolled back harsh regulations, and sent a clear message: crypto is welcome in the U.S. economy. Regulatory bodies like the SEC, Fed, and FDIC also eased their stance, making it easier for banks to work with crypto firms. These changes have encouraged big banks, once afraid of crypto risks, to start exploring the space again. The Crypto Race Is Heating Up Morgan Stanley isn’t the only one jumping in. Robinhood, Coinbase, and even Charles Schwab are all competing for crypto users. With a trusted name and strong security, Morgan Stanley might attract people who were unsure about crypto before. And they’re not alone. Charles Schwab and SoFi are also eyeing crypto offerings, signaling that traditional finance is finally embracing the digital asset world. If Morgan Stanley gets it right, it could mark the start of a new chapter, where crypto isn’t just for early adopters, but for everyone.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-01 12:16:15

The press release says that the integration will allow holders to deploy Bitcoin into decentralized finance ( DeFi ) via Sui’s infrastructure. Notably, there are no centralized custodians involved in the process. Furthermore, the team says Sui Foundation will operate a validator on the Stacks network. It argues that this partnership will allow Bitcoin’s $1.6 trillion in liquidity to unlock “new onchain opportunities that preserve the asset’s native security while unlocking DeFi use cases like lending, borrowing, and trading.” sBTC is coming soon on Sui!

At the same time, they’ll be able to build “more composable applications with rich asset behavior” through Sui, the announcement says.

The team also argues that Sui is an “ideal home” for BTC-backed assets due to its parallelized execution and object-centric design based on the Move programming language. Meanwhile, the rise in demand for BTCfi has been noticeable. Bitcoin DeFi protocols hit $6.5 billion in total value locked (TVL) by the end of 2024, the announcement notes. This figure currently stands at $5.84 billion, according to DeFiLlama . Source: DeFiLlama Notably, Sui says, Bitcoin has an “intentionally conservative architecture” that limits native DeFi, but Layer-2s built for this purpose have emerged. These solutions, including Stacks, enable smart contracts and decentralized applications ( dapps ) without altering Bitcoin’s core protocol. This helps expand utility. “With Stacks, Bitcoin holders can put their BTC to work through lending, swapping, and liquid staking—all secured by the Bitcoin network,” the announcement says. At the same time, Sui supports decentralized exchanges ( DEXs ), lending, and liquid staking within the DeFi space. As Adeniyi Abiodun, Co-Founder at Mysten Lab, the contributor to Sui, put it: ""Up to now, BTC has been treated as an idle asset"" ""sBTC activates Bitcoin liquidity in a decentralized way, unlocking Bitcoin DeFi across any ecosystem while benefiting from Stacks Signers' security"" — stacks.btc (@Stacks) May 1, 2025 Moreover, the Sui team says that more than 10% of Sui’s total TVL is in BTC and Bitcoin-derived assets, just months after the network enabled BTC bridging and staking. “sBTC is the safest, most decentralized path to making Bitcoin a productive asset,” said Muneeb Ali, Founder of Stacks. “Sui’s DeFi growth and powerful underlying technology make it a natural destination for sBTC.” You might also like OKX Wallet Becomes Official Sui Partner, Expands New Features The post Sui to Add Support for Stacks’ sBTC, BTCfi Holds $5.8 Billion in TVL appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|Bitcoin|SUI,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|SUI,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-05-01 12:17:03

New projects are launched by the day. Scandals hit the headlines regularly. And every once in a while, the “next big thing” pops up and takes the industry by storm. Amongst all this madness, standing out is more than just a challenge. For some, it can feel like an impossible task. Yes, while you might have revolutionary tech or feel like you’ve got the most elegant solution to a real problem, but without the right promotion strategy, you’re basically invisible. That’s where specialized crypto PR agencies come in and do the heavy lifting. Top 5 Crypto PR Agencies That Will Boost Your Project in 2025 Crypto PR Agencies Reviewed Evox Funday Agency X10 Agency DIFY Singapore Picking Your PR Partner Crypto PR Agencies Reviewed These aren’t your typical PR firms. They genuinely get the crypto world and all its nuances, warts and all. They understand the distinction between DeFi and GameFi, recognize credible media outlets, and have established relationships with the right influencers over time. They’re the people who can translate your technical whitepaper into something that actually excites potential users and investors, and that’s worth its weight in gold if you want to get ahead. Let’s take a look at five agencies that could help put your project on the map. MarketAcross Founded in 2014, MarketAcross is one of the first blockchain-specific PR agencies globally. Because of this, it’s pretty much safe to say that they’ve seen it all in the crypto space; the bull runs, the crashes, the trends that stuck around, and the ones that fizzled out overnight. MarketAcross PR agency is deliberate in their approach and knows what it takes to get your project noticed. They don’t just blast out generic press releases, take your money, and hope for the best. They take a content-first approach, focusing on creating material that they know crypto audiences will actually want to read. To back this up, their network of publication relationships is impressive, with connections across all the major crypto news outlets. These are the places that you need to be featured if you really want to make waves in the blockchain world. One of their key strengths is generating buzz around crypto events and major project milestones. When you look at their client list (Binance, Polygon, Solana) it’s clear they know how to work with projects at every level. Pros: No retainer fees. They succeed when you succeed Deep relationships with crypto publications that matter Proven results with industry heavyweights Cons: It may not be ideal for projects with very small budgets High demand means they may not be able to service all requests Evox As the first crypto-focused PR agency in Turkey, Evox brings something unique to the table. Since 2011, they have combined their deep technical expertise with marketing expertise to help their clients create campaigns that resonate in the cryptocurrency world. A key feature of Evox is its integrated approach. They don’t just do PR in isolation. Instead, their campaigns integrate social media, visual content, strategic messaging, and community building into a single cohesive approach. Their technical background enables them to genuinely understand the value of your project, eliminating the need for you to simplify or repeatedly explain it. Pros: Strong regional expertise in Turkish markets Technical knowledge informs their marketing strategies A comprehensive social approach beyond just PR Cons: May have limited reach in Western markets Smaller team than some larger players Funday Agency With a name like “ Funday ,” you might expect to get something a little different than your typical run-of-the-mill PR agency. And you’d be right. Founded in 2019, they bring a fresh, creative energy to marketing that truly sets them apart from more corporate and formal agencies. While they aren’t crypto-specific, Funday is a growing and innovative PR agency that would be an excellent fit for any projects looking to get creative and test the boundaries with what they can do. It’s for that reason they rightly label themselves as “big experience with boutique vibes.” You’ll get sophisticated strategies without feeling like just another client. While you may lose the technical expertise of crypto-specific teams, what really stands out about Funday is their ability to make your project accessible and exciting through creative campaigns. Pros: Genuinely creative campaign ideas that stand out Strong research-based approach to audience targeting Personal attention you don’t get from bigger agencies Cons: Less crypto-specific experience than some competitors Smaller network of crypto media connections Sometimes creativity might overshadow technical depth X10 Agency From a lighthearted name to something that sounds like it’s from the year 3000, X10 Agency is a blockchain-exclusive PR agency specializing across various categories. Some of these areas of expertise include ICOs, NFTs, DeFi , GameFi, and other related fields. They position themselves as a complete launchpad for Web3 projects. X10 is another agency that prides itself on its comprehensive range of services. Need PR? They’ve got you. Community management? Check. Influencer connections? Paid traffic? Partnerships with other projects? They cover that too. For founders who don’t want to juggle multiple agencies, this one-stop approach is appealing; however, it may come at the cost of quality in a specific area. With that said, X10 acknowledges that different types of crypto projects require distinct marketing approaches. They quite rightly state that the strategy for a play-to-earn game isn’t the same as for a serious financial protocol. Being able to work with an agency that understands and delivers this level of differentiation and personalized strategy is definitely a significant advantage. Pros: Wide range of marketing services under one roof Experience with many types of crypto projects Specialized approaches for different project categories Cons: May lack the specialized excellence of focused agencies Quality might vary between different service departments DIFY Singapore DIFY brings an interesting Asian perspective to cryptocurrency marketing, operating from its Singapore-based headquarters. They specialize in delivering integrated communications capabilities to brands across the blockchain, fintech, and emerging technology sectors. What DIFY is unique is their dual philosophy, which they mention on their site and across their marketing communications. This is represented by their mascots, Shoyu and Dan. Shoyu is all about bringing creative, unorthodox ideas. Dan focuses more on proven, traditional approaches. This isn’t about choosing one over the other. Instead, DIFY brings an innate awareness of when one situation may require a more traditional approach, or where another may have room for experimentation and boldness. This balance enables them to create campaigns that innovate, stay creative, and deliver reliable results. For projects targeting Asian markets (which, let’s face it, are massive in the crypto space), DIFY offers valuable regional insights and connections that Western agencies may lack. Pros: Strong presence and connections in Asian markets Nice balance between creative and traditional approaches Experience across multiple related tech sectors Cons: Less exclusively focused on crypto than some specialists May have limited reach in markets outside Asia Picking Your PR Partner There is no perfect PR agency, and there certainly is no one-size-fits-all approach here. The best agency for you will depend on several factors, including your current stage in the journey, the target audience you’re trying to reach, and your actual goals. Are you launching an NFT collection that needs creative marketing and influencer connections? Or are you building a serious DeFi protocol that requires technical credibility and trust-building? Your answers should guide your choice. The right agency won’t just take your money and send some press releases. They’ll become partners who understand your vision, challenge your assumptions when needed, and help you build genuine connections with your community.",Information,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|SPONSORED|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-01 12:25:00

One wallet led the charge in the SHIB burn spike, single-handedly burning 263.70 million tokens. About eight hours later, another large batch of 3.4 million SHIB was also removed from circulation. This sharp rise in token burns has sparked bullish sentiment across the community, as reducing supply often supports long-term price growth based on basic supply and demand. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Top Gainers for the Day: Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), Hyperliquid (HYPE), & Curve DAO (CRV) Primed for Double-Digit Gains , Over 410 Trillion SHIB Burned So Far Out of the original 1 quadrillion SHIB tokens, over 410 trillion have been burned so far.

This means a lot of holders are watching this price range closely, and if SHIB climbs just a little higher, we could see big moves. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Meme coin presales are a sub-section of broader crypto presales and they come with many specifics that are only applicable to them. The term “presale” itself refers to a sale of tokens that happens before the initial listing on a centralized or a centralized exchange. You may have heard other names such as initial coin offerings (ICOs), initial DEX offerings (IDOs) , initial exchange offerings (IEOs) , and more. Of course, all of these come with their own set of rules, but the general idea is more or less the same. In essence, meme coin presales refer to the preliminary sale of tokens that belong to the meme coin sector before they get listed on any sort of exchange medium. The main reason they’ve become so incredibly popular over the past few years is the general surge in interest in meme coins. Over the course of 2024 and 2025, we have seen a tremendous number of celebrities and influential figures launch their own meme coins. Perhaps the biggest attestation to their merits is the fact that the President of the United States himself – Donald Trump – has laucnhed his very own meme coin called TRUMP . His wife, Melania Trump, also has a meme coin called MELANIA , and the list goes so far deep the rabit hole it’s impossible to name all of them, but you get the point. Many people made a lot of money by investing in meme coins early and they have become one of the biggest narratives in the industry. The reality, however, is that there are thousands of meme coins launching every day through platforms such as pump.fun, so picking the right one requires a lot of attention, knowledge, and experience. The reality is that many of these are designed with predatory tokenomics in a way where they attempt to extract maximum value from retail traders and disappear, never to be seen again. Examples include the meme coins launched by the “Hawk Tuah” girl and even Argentina’s president Javier Milei – allegations both of whom have declined. In any case, let’s take a step back and identify the two critical events to keep an eye on when it comes to meme coin presales: Token Generation Event (TGE) : This is the process of the literal generation of the tokens for the project. Before the TGE takes place, there are no tokens available for anyone. In a lot of the cases, the TGE will happen immediately before the listing event, which is the second big thing to look for. Listing Event : This refers to the process of listing the meme coin for trading on an exchange. Note that this can be done on a centralized exchange or on a decentralized exchange. In both cases, the team should clarify this well in advance and you should be aware before investing. The presale itself can have many different stages. For instance, some teams prefer to do a tiered approach where each level sells tokens at more expensive prices, while others would do a fire sale and sell everything at once on a first-come first-serve (FCFS) basis. Pros and cons of meme coin presales Pros of meme coin presales Early entry at low prices gives the potential for big returns if the coin takes off after listing. Community hype and virality means that strong meme potential can create very explosive growth. Presales can help build a lot of loyal holders before the public launch. Meme coin presales offer early buyers extra tokens or cheaper prices. Cons of meme coin presales Very high risk of scams and rug pulls. Meme coins oftentimes don’t have long-term fundamentals or real-world use cases. Early buyers may struggle to sell because of low listing liquidity. Prices can crash post-launch if the hype fades or if whales dump their tokens. How to choose the best meme coin presale? Choosing the best meme coin presale can be a challenging task. Here are a few questions and important points to keep in mind so that you can at least narrow down the strong candidates. Project Fundamentals Theme and Narratives: Check if the meme coin taps into a popular trend, internet joke, or some sort of a cultural moment. With these cryptocurrencies, virality matters more than utility. Whitepaper: In many cases, the project won’t have a whitepaper, but if it does, make sure to check if the team has explained its vision. Look for witty content and strong meme presence. That’s what’s creating hype. Team: Many meme coins have anonymous teams. This doesn’t mean that their creators don’t have online presence – it’s just that their actual identities are not public. That’s okay so long as they have proven track record. Tokenomics Supply and Allocation: How many tokens are going to be minted and how are they divided among the team, presale, liqudity, and community rewards? Watch out for teams that reserve excessive allocations and unlock large portions of tokens at start. Liquidity Plans: Does the team plan to lock tokens for liquidity upon launching? This is especially important if the meme coin is launching on a decentralized exchange. Presale price vs. Launch price: If there is a massive markup, this could lead to quick dumps – check to see how fair the entri pricing is compared to the listing price. Community and Hype Social media buzz: Is there work being done on X, Telegram, Discord, Reddit, and other social media? Is the engagement organic? Make sure to only consider projects that do not engage with fake followers and comments. Influencer support: If there are a lot of influencers involved, make sure to be careful. They oftentimes receive significant allocations and dump on listing. Of course, that’s not always true. Meme culture strength: Is the meme game of the project’s team strong? Are people sharing jokes and creating viral content around it? Security and Transparency Rug pull protection: Are the liquidity pools locked and are there any anti-rug pull measures or smart contract audits? While not all projects do these, those who actually do deserve more attention, although that’s not a guarantee of success. Developer activity: Foes the team engage with the community and provide timely updates? Market Conditions Timing: This is perhaps the most important thing with meme coins. Investing in them while the market sentiment is bearish could be a mistake as many of these don’t recover from a single, even short-term, bear market or correction. What are the risks associated with meme coin presales? The risks associated with meme coin presales are typically the following: Rug pulls and exit scames Lack of real utility Liquidity shortage Short lifespan Regulatory risks Community manipulation Poor tokenomics Our methodology In our list of the best meme coin presales, we have taken a comprehensive approach to providing the most objectively-verifiable information about each of the listed projects.

He shared images from Visa’s 2025 presentation and legacy infrastructure documents, outlining how the digital asset is structurally positioned within Visa’s global payments framework. The foundation of this alignment is Visa’s $250 million purchase of Earthport, a UK-based payment network that Ripple has worked with since 2014. Earthport’s infrastructure allows it to process international payments through API, SWIFT, and other channels, and notably includes Ripple integration. One of the images highlights Ripple’s connection to Earthport’s payment instructions layer. Earthport, in turn, delivers payment credits via national clearing systems, indicating its potential role in real-time settlement with Ripple-enabled liquidity. XRP IS ALREADY POSITIONED WITH VISA, AND HERE’S HOW: In 2019, Visa acquired Earthport—a Ripple-enabled company that connects to RippleNet and can use XRP for cross-border payments. This gives Visa access to XRP’s liquidity and settlement capabilities through Earthport’s… pic.twitter.com/7r7rkoRiQ9 — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) April 29, 2025 Cross-Network Ambitions and Crypto-Focused Strategy Experts have theorized for years that Visa is secretly working with XRP , and the company’s documentation reinforces its increasing focus on crypto-enabled financial solutions. The timeline shows key milestones, such as the 2023 pilot of stablecoin settlements in USDC, the earlier implementation of Visa Direct, and cross-border A2A payments following the Earthport acquisition. Visa plans to become the Network of Networks, and it began this process in 2020, aiming to unify A2A, RTP, and card-based transactions under one system. This suggests Visa’s aim to integrate a wide range of payment rails, including those supporting blockchain-based settlements. Earthport’s integration with Ripple and its ability to facilitate XRP-based transfers aligns with this model. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 SMQKE pointed to a slide that presents Ripple’s cross-network payment vision. It includes Ripple’s liquidity services, XRP, and Visa among interconnected networks such as ACH and PayPal. Visa’s presence in the ecosystem underlines the researcher’s claim that “XRP is already positioned with Visa.” Cross-Border Use Cases and Infrastructure Readiness Visa’s strategy also places increasing emphasis on cross-border payments across various sectors. One image outlines innovation efforts targeted at gaming, education, crypto, and healthcare—all areas with strong global payment needs. The increasing interest from Visa also coincides with XRP’s recently gained regulatory clarity and Ripple’s freedom to sell XRP to institutional investors . Visa’s aim to improve cross-border authorization rates and expand in high-growth e-commerce segments supports the case for real-time, crypto-based settlement solutions like XRP. One of the images projects that ten countries will pilot Visa Protect for A2A transactions in 2025, with over $100 million in VisaNet settlement obligations expected in USDC. Key Ripple partners already have facilities to use XRP , and adoption by Visa could significantly increase the digital asset’s reach and potentially drive up its price.

In past cycles, the biggest returns often went to investors who spotted promising projects before broader recognition hit. This time, many analysts are pointing to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as one of the top cryptos to watch before the next bull market takes off. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance stands out in the increasingly competitive DeFi sector. It’s a fully decentralized protocol built around lending, borrowing, passive income opportunities, and the creation of an on-chain stablecoin system — all without the bottlenecks seen in older platforms. Currently in its presale stage, Mutuum has already attracted over 9,200 holders and raised more than $7.3 million, a strong signal that serious investors are paying close attention. With a current price under three cents, it’s being discussed among experts as one of the best cryptocurrency to invest today for those looking to maximize gains once the bull market kicks off. One of the most forward-looking aspects of Mutuum’s strategy is its preparation for Layer 2 scaling. As congestion and high fees continue to plague Ethereum during high-traffic periods, Mutuum is actively working on expanding onto Layer 2 networks like Arbitrum and Optimism. This move not only promises faster transactions and lower costs for users but also broadens Mutuum’s reach across different blockchain ecosystems. It’s a step that major platforms must take to stay competitive — and Mutuum is positioning itself ahead of the curve. For anyone wondering what is the best cryptocurrency to invest in before new technology reshapes DeFi, MUTM is a serious candidate. Mutuum Finance operates around two main lending models: peer-to-contract (P2C) for blue-chip assets and peer-to-peer (P2P) for more speculative tokens. This hybrid setup caters to a broad audience, ensuring there are opportunities for both cautious and aggressive investors. Depositors receive mtTokens representing their assets, which automatically accumulate value through interest over time. At the same time, borrowers can lock up collateral and access liquidity, all while preserving ownership of their assets. This dynamic promotes continuous platform activity and creates natural demand for the MUTM token. Furthermore, Mutuum’s integration of a self-sustaining stablecoin — minted directly through its lending markets — means the ecosystem doesn’t depend on external stablecoins, keeping liquidity and value within its own framework. These innovations place Mutuum among the next big cryptocurrencies poised to disrupt traditional DeFi models. The current Mutuum Finance presale is moving quickly, with Phase 4 already more than half complete. A price increase to $0.03 is expected soon, representing a 20% surge for new investors compared to the current $0.025 entry point. On top of that, Mutuum is undergoing a CertiK audit, one of the highest standards in blockchain security, helping boost confidence among early adopters. Meanwhile, the project is running a $100,000 giveaway for community participants, with full participation details available on Mutuum’s official website — another major driver of user engagement during this crucial growth phase. With large-scale investors accumulating positions and community support growing daily, Mutuum is checking all the boxes typically seen in breakout altcoins before major market rallies. As the bull market approaches, investors looking for the best crypto to buy now would be wise to consider MUTM. Its combination of capital-efficient lending models, passive income through mtTokens, Layer 2 expansion plans, and stablecoin integration create a rare setup for massive growth potential. Compared to older projects like Cardano and XRP, which continue their steady paths, Mutuum Finance offers a much fresher opportunity for those who want explosive upside rather than slow and steady gains. For anyone asking what crypto to invest in before the next bull market fully ignites, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as one of the smartest plays available.

The excitement is palpable as the Bitcoin price has reportedly soared to incredible new heights. According to the latest market monitoring data, BTC has risen above $96,000 , marking a truly significant milestone in its volatile yet often rewarding journey. This isn’t just a small uptick; breaching a level like $96k is a major event that grabs the attention of investors, analysts, and enthusiasts globally, hinting at strong upward momentum in the market. What Does This Historic BTC Surge to $96,000 Signify? Seeing BTC surge past previous psychological and technical resistance levels, especially nearing the six-figure mark, is a powerful indicator of several underlying market dynamics. When Bitcoin reaches such valuation points, it typically suggests: Increased Investor Confidence: Reaching higher prices validates the belief of long-term holders (HODLers) and attracts new capital from both retail and institutional players. Growing Adoption: A strong price trend often correlates with increased mainstream awareness and potentially broader adoption of Bitcoin as a store of value or even a medium of exchange. Network Effect: Higher prices can strengthen the network effect, making Bitcoin more secure (due to increased mining incentives) and more attractive for development and infrastructure build-out. Market Maturity: While still volatile, Bitcoin’s ability to sustain rallies to such high levels suggests increasing market depth and liquidity compared to its earlier days. This specific move, pushing the Bitcoin price beyond $96,000, is particularly noteworthy. On platforms like the Binance USDT market, where it was observed trading at $96,014.97, this price point reflects intense buying pressure. It suggests that demand is currently outweighing supply significantly at these higher valuations. Such price action often triggers a wave of positive sentiment, potentially leading to further upward movement as fear of missing out (FOMO) kicks in for those on the sidelines. Analyzing the Forces Fueling the Bitcoin Price Rally Every significant move in the Crypto market is driven by a confluence of factors. The rally pushing Bitcoin towards and above $96,000 is likely no different. Several potential catalysts could be at play: 1. Institutional Adoption: We’ve seen increasing interest from large financial institutions, corporations, and even sovereign states. Investments, Bitcoin ETF approvals (or anticipation), and companies adding BTC to their balance sheets can inject substantial capital and lend credibility to the asset class. This institutional wave provides large-scale buying power that can easily move the needle on the Bitcoin price . 2. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic conditions, such as inflation concerns, quantitative easing policies, or uncertainty in traditional markets, can drive investors towards alternative assets like Bitcoin, which is often viewed as a hedge or ‘digital gold’. When traditional investments seem less appealing, the flow of capital into the Crypto market can accelerate. 3. Halving Event Impact: The periodic Bitcoin halving reduces the rate at which new Bitcoins are created, tightening supply. Historically, halvings have preceded significant bull runs. While the immediate impact isn’t always felt, the reduced supply pressure over time can contribute to upward price momentum, making it a key narrative in Bitcoin news cycles. 4. Increased Retail Interest: While institutional money is significant, renewed interest from individual investors can also provide a strong boost. Easy-to-use trading platforms, positive media coverage (like news of BTC surge ), and success stories can draw new participants into the market, adding to the buying volume. 5. Technological Developments and Network Health: Continuous improvements to the Bitcoin network, increased hash rate (indicating network security), and developments in scaling solutions or layers built on top of Bitcoin can increase confidence in its long-term viability and utility, indirectly supporting the Cryptocurrency price . It’s rarely just one thing. Often, it’s a combination of these elements creating a perfect storm for a significant price rally like the one pushing Bitcoin towards $96k. How Does This BTC Surge Affect the Wider Crypto Market? Bitcoin’s movements have a gravitational pull on the rest of the Crypto market . When BTC surges , it often leads to what’s known as an ‘altcoin season’ or at least a significant positive impact on other cryptocurrencies. Here’s how: Increased Capital Flow: Profits made in Bitcoin are often rotated into altcoins as investors seek higher percentage gains or diversification. Improved Market Sentiment: A rising Bitcoin price creates overall bullish sentiment across the market, boosting confidence in other digital assets. Increased Visibility: Major Bitcoin news stories about price milestones draw attention to the entire cryptocurrency space, bringing new users and capital that may then explore altcoins. However, it’s not always a direct correlation. Sometimes, during a massive Bitcoin price rally, altcoins might lag initially as capital concentrates in BTC before potentially flowing out later. It’s a dynamic relationship, but generally, a strong Bitcoin performance is a positive sign for the broader Cryptocurrency price landscape. What Potential Challenges and Risks Come with a $96,000 Bitcoin Price? While reaching $96,000 is exciting, it’s crucial to remember that the Crypto market is inherently volatile. High prices can also introduce or amplify certain risks: 1. Increased Volatility and Potential for Pullbacks: Sharp rises can be followed by swift and significant corrections as investors take profits. A move from $96,000 back down could be substantial. 2. Regulatory Scrutiny: Higher prices and increased attention often lead to greater scrutiny from regulators worldwide. New regulations could impact trading, taxation, or usage of cryptocurrencies. 3. Market Manipulation: With increased value, the potential for large players to influence the market through significant buys or sells can become more pronounced. 4. External Shocks: Geopolitical events, technological failures, or unexpected global financial crises can still trigger sell-offs, regardless of how high the Bitcoin price has climbed. Understanding these challenges is vital for anyone participating in the market, especially after a significant BTC surge . Actionable Insights for Navigating This Bitcoin News So, what should you do with this information about the Bitcoin price potentially reaching $96,000? Here are a few actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep following reliable Bitcoin news sources and market analysis. Understand the narratives and data points influencing the price. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Don’t make decisions based solely on price movements or hype. Understand the technology, market cap, and fundamentals. Consider Your Risk Tolerance: The Crypto market is high-risk. Only invest what you can afford to lose. A BTC surge is exciting, but corrections happen. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Decide if you are investing for the long haul (HODLing) or looking to trade short-term volatility. Your strategy will dictate your actions. Diversification: While Bitcoin is dominant, consider diversifying across other assets within the Crypto market if it aligns with your strategy. Security: If you hold significant amounts, ensure your assets are stored securely, preferably in hardware wallets. Reacting impulsively to a high Cryptocurrency price can be detrimental. Having a plan based on research and risk management is crucial. What Lies Ahead? Future Bitcoin News and Price Targets Predicting future price movements is notoriously difficult in the Crypto market . However, reaching $96,000 opens up discussions about what milestones might be next. The psychological level of $100,000 becomes an immediate target. Beyond that, analysts might look at Fibonacci extensions or previous market cycle peaks to identify potential resistance levels or targets. Future Bitcoin news will likely focus on whether Bitcoin can consolidate above $96k, the volume supporting the move, and how the macroeconomic environment evolves. Continued institutional adoption, regulatory clarity (or lack thereof), and overall risk appetite in global markets will all play significant roles in determining the next steps for the Bitcoin price . The path won’t be linear. Expect volatility, pullbacks, and periods of consolidation. However, breaching significant levels like $96,000 suggests strong underlying bullish sentiment and potential for further growth if favorable conditions persist. Conclusion: A New Era for Bitcoin and the Crypto Market? The report of BTC surging past $96,000 is undoubtedly a landmark event, highlighting the asset’s incredible journey and its potential for continued growth. This achievement on exchanges like Binance reflects robust demand and increasing confidence from a wide range of investors. While the rally is exciting and generates positive Bitcoin news globally, it also serves as a reminder of the market’s inherent volatility and the importance of a cautious, informed approach. Whether you’re a seasoned crypto veteran or just starting to pay attention to the Cryptocurrency price movements, this development underscores the dynamic nature of the space. As Bitcoin continues to mature and gain wider acceptance, its price movements will remain a key indicator for the health and future direction of the entire digital asset ecosystem. The journey to $96k is significant, and the market watches keenly to see if this momentum can be sustained, potentially paving the way for new all-time highs and further evolution of the Crypto market .

The crypto-tied eye scanning project World is now in the US, and Ripple reportedly made a $5 billion bid to acquire Circle. Morgan Stanley eyes crypto rollout for E*Trade platform: Bloomberg Banking giant Morgan Stanley reportedly plans to list cryptocurrencies on its E*Trade investment brokerage and trading platform. According to a May 1 Bloomberg report , the firm intends to list crypto assets on E*Trade in 2026. The plan is still in early development, and the bank is said to be exploring partnerships with established crypto firms to power the service. Internal discussions about cryptocurrency support reportedly began in late 2024. E*Trade homepage. Source: E*Trade This would not be Morgan Stanley’s first exposure to digital assets. The bank’s wealthiest clients have had access to crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and futures for some time, with the firm’s advisers allowed to pitch Bitcoin ETFs since August 2024 . Eyeball scanning crypto project World hits US shores OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s crypto-tied digital identity project World, formerly Worldcoin, said on April 30 that it will make its US debut , first coming to the so-called “key innovation hubs” of Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville and San Francisco. World offers a crypto token, Worldcoin (WLD), to those who verify their humanity with its spherical device called an Orb that scans a user’s face and eyeballs, which can then be used to make a World ID on the company’s platform to verify they are human on connected services including Minecraft, Reddit and Discord. Source: World The firm had previously stayed away from the US due to regulatory concerns over offering a token, fears now seemingly allayed with the crypto-friendly Trump administration. World also announced a tie-up with Visa for a card that allows payments in WLD, and a pilot program testing out World ID with the online dating giant Match Group, which owns Tinder, Hinge, Match.com, and Plenty of Fish. Ripple multi-billion bid to purchase Circle rejected — Report Blockchain payments firm Ripple has reportedly bid up to $5 billion in an effort to acquire stablecoin issuer Circle, but the offer was rejected. According to an April 30 Bloomberg report, Ripple put in a bid of $4 billion to $5 billion as part of an attempted takeover of Circle, which was rejected as being too low. Ripple hasn’t considered whether to make another bid to purchase the stablecoin issuer. The reported acquisition attempt came less than 30 days after Circle applied for an initial public offering (IPO) in the US. Cointelegraph reached out to representatives of Circle and Ripple for comment, but had not received a response from either at the time of publication. Ripple reportedly had an $11 billion valuation in 2024, an estimate CEO Brad Garlinghouse called “outdated” as of January. The blockchain company purchased prime broker Hidden Road for roughly $1.2 billion in April, claiming the move would help scale activity for XRP and XRP Ledger.",Trump memecoin|Solana memecoin|TRUMP token|Solana|SOL|Nova Labs|SEC|Securities and Exchange Commission|crypto regulation|TRUMP rally|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|AVAX|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|ICO|LINK|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|UNI|USDT|XRP|ZRX|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BNB|FDUSD|TON|USDC|ENA|ZK|WLD|OM|KAVA|ARKM,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-01 13:26:25

Dogecoin price may reach a maximum of $1.07 in 2025. With a potential surge, the DOGE price may achieve its $3 mark in 2030. Dogecoin, the memecoin category leader, has picked up the pace amidst the uptrend in the market. Between the turn of events, marketers are still hoping for it to match its June 2021 high. The hopes could soon be fulfilled, as the House of Doge within the Dogecoin Foundation has opened the doors to the “Official Dogecoin Reserve” by acquiring 10 million DOGE to boost payment utility and transaction efficiency. Talking about DOGE’s price, it is currently trading at $0.179, a bullish push from here could lead DOGE to its resistance at $0.20. On the flipside, if bears hunt DOGE down, its price could tumble to $0.15 in the very short term. As the underlying dynamics shift amid broader market volatility, investors have started wondering, “Will Dogecoin reach $1?” to “Will Dogecoin go up?” Are you wondering the same?

On the other hand, if the market is hit again by external forces like regulations or negative statements by influencers. Hence, the meme coin might trade at a potential low of $ 0.62 . We expect the DOGE price to reach a new swing high of $1.07 by the end of 2025. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $0.62 $0.84 $1.07 Can DOGE Break the $1 Barrier? Given DOGE’s success, largely driven by hype with some technical progress, crossing $1 by 2025 remains a realistic possibility. A sustained media frenzy and growing endorsement deals could maintain bullish momentum. Expanded merchant adoption would also strengthen confidence in its long-term viability. Dogecoin’s Tokenomics and Long-Term Outlook The future of Dogecoin hinges on its utility. Meme popularity alone may not sustain it indefinitely, but advancements in transaction fees, speed, and business collaborations could help it thrive as a mainstream digital currency. Its large and passionate community will likely continue to drive positive evolution. Conclusion Given Dogecoin’s past price behavior, driven largely by online hype and media coverage, it has the potential to reach over $1 in 2025. DOGE has shown remarkable resilience, and key factors like expanded merchant adoption, community growth, and protocol upgrades could enhance its viability.

To read full editions, subscribe . It’s been a busy week for VC raises, and some of the projects have caught heat around social media for being infra plays. Like Unto Labs, for example. “We definitely got bucketed into the whole ‘another L1, oh no’ [discourse]. We felt a little sad about that, but we’ll just have to prove it. Because, in some ways, it’s true,” cofounder Will Yoo told me. But both Yoo and cofounder Liam Heeger said they’re up to the challenge because they’ve both “done this before,” whereas other teams haven’t “built systems that are supposed to perform at extremely high levels of scale.” “We love Solana and we think they’re going to be an incredible competitor. We’d be honored to compete with them,” Yoo said. They’ll be “ripping” out the Solana virtual machine with Thru, and they argue that they won’t be competing with Jump’s Solana client — something that’s literally held up in court. Heeger is ex-Jump Crypto, but he didn’t leave without making some waves. Jump filed a suit against Heeger after he departed Firedancer to start Unto with Yoo. The case was dismissed in February, and the two told me that they had a term sheet from Electric Capital, which led their seed round, the next day. They wouldn’t comment further on the litigation. The $14.4 million rounds are a combined pre-seed and seed raises. Framework Ventures led their pre-seed. The capital will go towards building out the core infrastructure on Thru and the ecosystem around it, which they expect to be “capital-intensive, but because [Thru’s] going first-party rather than third-party, we believe we can be capital-efficient.” The two, in Thru’s manifesto , argued that blockchains “have lost their way.” “Thru’s consensus scales through competition, not accumulation. Operators earn their spot with uptime, throughput, and by relentlessly pushing fees toward zero, not by how much stake they can attract,” it said. The goal is to not only compete with other Web3 projects, but also to compete with Web2. Lofty ambitions, right? I asked Yoo and Heeger where they think they’ll be in a year, and they told me they want to “spend the amount of time necessary to create something incredible.” So it may take some time, but the two think they can stand out in the long term.

With just $3,270 , strategic investors can gain exposure to multiple high-upside opportunities without chasing overvalued giants. This week, four standout coins— XRP , Aptos (APT) , Kaspa (KAS) , and Solana (SOL) —are making waves with strong technical signals and real market traction. And among these movers, one rising altcoin— MAGACOINFINANCE —is quietly becoming a top contender for early-stage growth. XRP: Eyeing a Breakout Amid Institutional Interest XRP is currently trading between $2.27 and $2.29, maintaining momentum after a notable 4.7% rally over the past 24 hours. Analysts predict a rally to $5 following a bullish breakout from a falling wedge pattern. The potential approval of a spot XRP ETF by Franklin Templeton and developments in the Ripple lawsuit are driving optimism. ​ Aptos (APT): Building Momentum with Layer-1 Innovations Aptos is trading at $4.71, with a market cap of $2.85B. The coin has experienced a 2.84% increase in the past 24 hours. Analysts anticipate a potential increase to $6.44 by April 27, 2025. The platform’s focus on scalability and security continues to attract attention.​ Kaspa (KAS): Gaining Traction with Unique Architecture Kaspa is trading at $0.0991, with a market cap of $2.59B. The coin has experienced a 2.03% increase in the past 24 hours. Analysts predict a potential rise to $0.1377 by April 30, 2025.

Solana (SOL): Strengthening Position in the DeFi Ecosystem Solana is trading between $145.97 and $150.04, maintaining its critical $150 support level. Analysts are eyeing a potential breakout to $205, citing bullish technical patterns. The platform’s scalability and low transaction fees continue to make it an attractive option for developers and users alike.​ MAGACOINFINANCE: Emerging as a Promising Contender While established cryptocurrencies continue to make headlines, MAGACOINFINANCE is quietly carving out its niche. With a growing community and increasing interest, it stands as a project to watch in the coming months. Unlike many projects trying for attention, MAGACOINFINANCE is building momentum through results—not promises. From an outsider’s perspective, it may seem like just another emerging name, but insiders and early adopters are witnessing something different: real community engagement, rapidly growing visibility, and an investor base that’s not just speculative but strategic. Final Thoughts With XRP, Aptos, Kaspa, and Solana showing strong performance and MAGACOINFINANCE emerging as a promising early-stage project, investors have a diverse array of opportunities to consider in 2025. Those looking to make a $3,270 investment count across multiple projects may want to pay close attention to MAGACOINFINANCE .

The White House claims the Elon Musk-founded Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has saved over $100 billion. Still, government data showed that gross domestic product (GDP) contracted at an annualized rate of 0.3% in the first quarter of 2025, which begs the question of whether DOGE has saved any money at all. According to the US Department of Commerce, GDP declined for the first time since 2022, a drop from the previous quarter’s 2.4% growth, far below economists’ projections of a 0.8% expansion. The decline was largely attributed to a ballooning trade deficit, government expenditures, and lower consumer spending. Are DOGE’s savings claims factual? Elon Musk and DOGE have claimed average weekly savings of over $10 billion since the department was officially signed into existence in January. “We’re talking about almost $200 billion and rising fast,” Trump told the BBC on April 23. Back in October 2024, weeks before the US presidential elections, the Tesla CEO pledged to trim $2 trillion from federal spending. That target was later revised to $150 billion by the end of the 2026 fiscal year. DOGE maintains a running tally of its estimated savings on its website, listing the total at $160 billion as of April 20. However, less than 40% of those savings have been itemized. The department claims that around 30% of all savings are currently backed by receipts available online, while others were “unavailable for legal reasons.” The site promises to publish all documentation in a “digestible and transparent manner.” Chamath Palihapitiya, a Canadian-American venture capitalist, said in an April 30 social media post that “the US Government needed to borrow $53B less than forecasted because of money saved by DOGE among other things.” So let me get this straight: 1. Energy prices falling with oil around $60 2. 10Y UST yield falling and is now back to 4.18% 3. The US Government needed to borrow $53B LESS than forecasted because of money saved by DOGE among other things. Not bad. — Chamath Palihapitiya (@chamath) April 29, 2025 On April 28, the US Treasury Department reported its latest borrowing figures, saying it expects to borrow $514 billion in privately held net marketable debt during the current quarter ending in June. This estimate is $391 billion higher than the one issued in February. Still, the department asserted that the figures increased because of a lower beginning-of-quarter cash balance and weaker net cash flows. Excluding those changes, Treasury said its revised borrowing figure was actually $53 billion less than expected, a figure that Palihapitiya and others have tied to the Trump administration’s cost-cutting claims. During the January–March quarter, the federal government borrowed $369 billion, lower than the $815 billion estimated in February. The discrepancy was mainly due to a smaller-than-anticipated end-of-quarter cash balance, though actual borrowing, when adjusted for that factor, was only $2 billion below the original forecast. President Trump: Tariffs are not why the economy is down Over recent months, the Trump administration has imposed new levies on foreign imports, particularly from China, which caused consumers and businesses to rush purchases ahead of rising prices. Some economists believe Trump’s effort to reengineer global trade could lead to inflation and push the US into recession. On the other side, the White House is confident that tariffs will work out for America in the long run. One of the few encouraging numbers in the Commerce Department report was business investment. Gross private domestic investment jumped by 21.9% in the first quarter, its highest level since late 2021, and business spending rose by 9.8%. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Michael Saylor and Pompliano’s Predictions Explained,https://coinpedia.org/news/buy-now-before-bitcoin-hits-1-million-michael-saylor-and-pomplianos-predictions-explained/,"The post Buy Now Before Bitcoin Hits $1 Million! Michael Saylor and Pompliano’s Predictions Explained appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Michael Saylor , the executive chairman of the Bitcoin-backed company Strategy , is making waves with his bold prediction: Bitcoin could soon reach $1 million. In a recent tweet, Saylor warned that by the time financial advisers approve Bitcoin as a good investment, it might already be too late to buy. Why the bold claim? Let’s dig deeper. By the time your financial adviser says it’s OK to buy Bitcoin, it’ll cost $1 million. When they say it’s a good idea, it’ll be $10 million. pic.twitter.com/5CRrf2gSFL — Michael Saylor (@saylor) May 1, 2025 What’s Fueling Bitcoin Price Growth? Saylor’s comments come at a time when institutional interest in Bitcoin is growing rapidly. U.S. fund managers like Fidelity, Charles Schwab, Wells Fargo, Mariner, and Fisher Investments have collectively invested over $19 billion in Bitcoin ETFs . These large investments show that Bitcoin is moving from a niche asset to something embraced by major institutions. Saylor believes that this increased institutional interest will only drive Bitcoin’s price higher. As more institutions get involved, Bitcoin’s scarcity becomes even more significant. Saylor argues that this will push the price of Bitcoin up, making it harder for regular investors to afford. He believes that Bitcoin could soon hit $10 million per coin once banks and financial institutions fully adopt it. Bitcoin Will Soon Be Too Expensive to Buy, Claims Saylor Saylor’s outlook on Bitcoin is based on the idea that as more banks and institutions start to use Bitcoin, demand will push its price through the roof. He sees Bitcoin as a major shift in how the world thinks about money, and as more financial giants adopt it, the price will only rise. “By the time your financial adviser says it’s OK to buy Bitcoin, it’ll cost $1 million. When they say it’s a good idea, it’ll be $10 million,” he wrote on X. Saylor believes that waiting for traditional financial advice could leave investors behind, as Bitcoin’s price could become unaffordable before it’s widely accepted by financial experts. Pompliano Joins Saylor’s Bullish Bet Saylor is not alone in his belief that Bitcoin is on the verge of a massive price increase. Anthony Pompliano, a well-known Bitcoin advocate and investor, also supports Saylor’s prediction. Pompliano points to growing institutional adoption, Bitcoin’s limited supply, and the rising global demand for Bitcoin as key reasons why the cryptocurrency could reach $1 million. He highlights the fundamentals of Bitcoin – its scarcity and increasing institutional support – as key drivers of its future value. Global Bitcoin Adoption: What’s on the Horizon? The momentum behind Bitcoin’s rise is growing fast. Major fintech companies are preparing to integrate Bitcoin into their services, and countries like El Salvador and some U.S. states are increasing their Bitcoin reserves. These moves signal that Bitcoin is becoming more widely accepted and may soon be considered a mainstream asset. Still, with the volatile nature of the crypto market, it’s hard to predict exactly when Bitcoin will hit $1 million. However, one thing is clear: the window for purchasing Bitcoin at lower prices is closing quickly.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-01 13:32:52

So will I, so will your neighbor, so will your best friend, and so will all of your family. All of our jobs will be automated, thanks to AI. This is the prediction of Shaw Walters (who in Web3 style typically just goes by “Shaw”), founder of Eliza Labs, and creator of ElizaOS. “We’re going to automate all of the jobs. Like, all of the jobs are going to be automated,” says Shaw. “There aren’t going to be any jobs. And there shouldn’t be, because any work that I can get a robot to do is beneath me. And I think we will look back on this time like we look back on slavery. Like, ‘What the fuck were we doing?’” Onstage at the AI Summit at Consensus 2025 , Shaw will unpack this theory in a keynote titled, “How AI Agents and Humanoid Robots will Reshape Society…and Why Crypto is the Key.” Here he gives a quick sneak peek. Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity. What excites you the most about AI Agents? Personally, this is a sort of selfish quest. I don't like sitting at my desk all day with my shoulders rounding, becoming this troll who’s coding all day. What I want to do is to pace around and tell my agents to do things and code for me. Coding has gotten to the point where I have another window up, and I'm just coding with Gemini in Cursor. I just start speaking and saying, “Hey, this is what I want. I want you to change this, this, and this,” and it just starts going. And why can’t that just be embodied? Why can't I just be walking down the street talking to my agent and it's writing my code for me? Why do I have to be sitting here glued to this desk? So I really want to unbox the user interface personally for myself, and have my agent with me everywhere I go. I can just call it if I have an idea. It answers my email. What do you think will be the first killer use case of agents that really goes mainstream? Well, definitely coding. It’s already the first case. Fair. But what about for normies, for non-coders? Well for us [at Eliza], it’s social agents. And then I run a remote team and DAO community, right? We have 20 people that come to work every day and develop code. I have a group chat right now of eight people. And we have 20 channels on Discord and we have a Telegram. So we have all this communication happening in all these places, and we have these very obvious problems everyone else has. I don't know what's going on in most of the chats. I don't have time to read most of it. I'd love if it was just summarized for me. They should be like, ""Hey, what has this guy been working on right now?"" And it's like, ""Oh, he worked on this. He answered this."" Great. So we have a bot that's doing just that thing. It checks in with every single employee every day and gets a [status update] from them. And it's tracking every single chat and all of our digital spaces and summarizes everything. Why, in your mind, is crypto crucial to this larger vision of yours of AI Agents? Why is Web3 necessary? I think it's very obvious that it's hard for me to give an agent a PayPal account. But I can just spin up a wallet for this agent and that agent. I could build a game where I'm like, ""I need 10,000 wallets."" Because what I'm really doing is giving an agent the ability to prove that it is itself with a cryptographic signing tool, just like I'm giving any other user. So agents are just proxies for other users and they get the same benefits that any other user does. But I think that there's a bigger question here of like why crypto at all? And I think the reason is because I think that we should be able to create our own money. It's not a power that we should necessarily give to states, although states have the ability to enforce it with force. So there's a bigger question of, what’s the war we’re fighting here? This is something that I’ll be sharing in my Consensus talk. We’re going to automate all of the jobs. Like, all of the jobs are going to be automated. There aren’t going to be any jobs. And there shouldn’t be, because any work that I can get a robot to do is beneath me. And I think we will look back on this time like we look back on slavery. Like, ""What the fuck were we doing?” We were making everybody work for dollars with all of their time. That's crazy to me. They should have been pursuing their passions. They should have been asking, “Why are we here and what are we doing?” They should have been forming their own basis of spirituality instead of just going to work every day. And so, in that reality, well, there's a big problem. I can think of a few… If there’s no jobs, then we have no money. But actually none of the rich people in our country have jobs. How do they make money? They’re investing. And I think this is the world we have to live in, where we’re all investors, and nobody's a worker. It's just insane to me that we live in a world where all the rich people don't work, and yet we think that's the way to getting rich. I’m trying to visualize this. It’s wild to imagine a world where no one has jobs, and all the work is beneath us. It’s inevitable. Are we writing poetry all day? How are we filling our time? What does humanity look like? Okay, so let's say you somehow received an airdrop that you put into a project, and now you have something like $80 million worth of value. What would you do? What’s your next move? I see where you’re going with this. So the idea is that you think about what your passions are, and how you’d spend your time if you had unlimited money? And then that’s what you’d be doing in this world where all the jobs are automated. Yeah. I would be at my computer working on AGI. I would be working on that all day. Let’s go there now. What’s your guess of when we get to AGI, or if we get to AGI? What is AGI? [Both laugh.] So, does AGI to you imply sentience? Well, my favorite coined term was that AGI is the thing that computers can't do yet. How about that? It's a bit of Zeno's Paradox , right? It will forever be outside of its grasp. Yes, we have normalized the fact that, like, I can talk to ChatGPT on voice in my phone and get instant answers to almost anything. Like, we're sitting here having ChatGPT do tarot readings, and give us answers to how “Magic: the Gathering” works. Wild times! Thanks Shaw, this was fun. See you in Toronto.

This is particularly noteworthy because the company’s odds for a $SOL ETF were just 70% back in February, i.e., only a couple of months ago. Combined with the CME listing Solana-based futures contracts in March, a $SOL ETF will likely rocket Solana to the moon. Keep reading to find out all the reasons for being bullish on Solana right now. We’ll also point you towards the best altcoins you can buy today to make the most of $SOL’s bright future. Solana Futures Open Interest Nears All-Time High While six asset managers await the SEC’s permission to list $SOL ETFs, the crypto’s future open interest reached $5.75B (or $40.5M $SOL). In addition to being a chunky 5% increase from March, this metric is now close to its all-time high. The demand for $SOL derivatives is also 50% higher than $XRP’s. Moreover, this data is hot off the oven (recorded just a few days ago), so it’s dead accurate and proof of strong institutional interest in the blockchain. One of the biggest reasons behind the growing adoption of $SOL derivatives is that the crypto held the crucial $140 support level. With rising DEX volumes and a staggering $9.5B in total value locked (TVL), $SOL can easily surge past $200 well before a potential spot ETF approval on October 10. What Does $SOL’s Chart Say? Technical analysis on $SOL’s charts paints a pretty picture, too. The crypto has bounced perfectly from the 10, 20, and 50 EMAs simultaneously on the daily chart, which is a hugely positive signal. The aforementioned bounce is also at a major support/resistance zone, further proving that the current bullish rally could hold itself nicely. The only thing left to see is whether $SOL can break and hold itself above the 200 EMA. However, as per the 4-hour chart, it should easily be able to do that, seeing as it’s above all the major EMAs on that time frame. All in all, Solana is doing really well and could pump soon. If you want to ride its growth, here are three Solana-based coins that could give you the best results in an already-pumping market. Our top pick, Solaxy , shows the best potential. It’s still in presale, which has turned out to be a massive success thanks to over $30M in early investor funding. 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Best Altcoin on Solana, over $32M in Presale Funding Unlike other coins on Solana, Solaxy ($SOLX) won’t just use the blockchain’s low-cost, high-speed architecture to further its interests. Its goal, in fact, is to improve Solana. Solana has become too popular for its own good, ironically. A recent massive influx of new investors to the network has overloaded it. As a result, it has been struggling with congestion and scalability issues. Solaxy will solve Solana’s aforementioned issues by building the first-ever Layer 2 scaling protocol on the network. It will process some of Solana’s transactions on a sidechain, reducing the burden on its mainnet and increasing transaction speed while lowering traffic congestion. In one word, Solaxy will optimize Solana’s key areas. The utility-based nature of $SOLX significantly contributes to its uniqueness and makes it one of the best cryptos to buy today . What’s more, Solaxy will also jack up Solana’s affordability by processing multiple transactions simultaneously, i.e., in batches. This will reduce the per-transaction cost, making crypto more affordable to people like you and me. As mentioned earlier, Solaxy is currently in presale, which is another reason why it’s such a lucrative opportunity. Remember, prices are at their lowest during the presale stage, offering insane risk-to-reward possibilities (like a 29x increase by the end of 2026 ). With over $32.6M in presale funding so far, one $SOLX is currently available for just $0.00171. Here’s how to buy it . 2. ai16z ($AI16Z) – Venture Capital Firm Run by AI Agents ai16z ($AI16Z) really stands out because it’s the first-ever venture capital firm run solely by AI agents. This crypto project is redefining the possibilities of artificial intelligence in the crypto investment space. A decentralized trading fund, ai16z uses AI agents to collect and analyze investment-related data, including current community sentiment. This speeds up the entire process of deciding whether a certain company is worth investing in. Aside from extra speed, AI will also reduce human error. What’s more, these AI agents are also equipped to execute transactions both on-chain and off-chain, further improving flexibility and transaction speed. As a leader in the AI-powered decentralized trading segment, $AI16Z has unsurprisingly been one of the most successful cryptos of late. It reached a record market cap of around $2.6B in January 2025. Over the last month or so, the token is up a staggering 60%. It’s also currently one of the top trending cryptos , having jumped 10% in just the last 24 hours. $AI16Z is currently trading at $0.3043 . 3. Bonk ($BONK) – Biggest Dog Meme Coin on Solana Often referred to as ‘the dog coin of the people,’ Bonk is the first and the largest dog-themed meme coin on the Solana blockchain. It’s also the fifth-largest meme coin across the board, with a market capitalization of over $1.5B. Only $TRUMP, $PEPE, $SHIB, and $DOGE are above it. Launched in December 2022, $BONK currently boasts over 17,000% in lifetime returns, which more than justifies its massive popularity among crypto degens. After a nearly two-month-long steady decline, the token is climbing once again. It’s up over 36% in the last week and 67% in the last month. With one of the lowest per-token prices (just $0.00001968 at the time of writing) in the entire meme coin industry, $BONK is certainly one of the best cheap cryptos to buy to benefit from a potential $SOL rally. Best Altcoins on $SOL – A Golden Buying Opportunity Just the increased likelihood of a $SOL ETF has put the best altcoins on Solana in green. Its actual launch, therefore, could be a canon event that sets forth a new future for $SOL and Solana-based cryptos. That being said, we urge our readers to kindly do their own research and back their intuition with facts.

Called the 21Shares Sui ETF, the proposed ETF will issue common shares of beneficial interest by seeking to track the performance of SUI held by 21Shares’ US subsidiary. The US filing comes a year after 21Shares started trading the 21Shares Sui Staking exchange-traded product in Europe in July 2024, with its first listings on Euronext Paris and Euronext Amsterdam. No ticker or planned exchange yet The 128-page filing does not specify on which US exchange the new SUI ETF is expected to debut trading. The ETF also doesn’t have a ticker symbol yet. “There is no certainty that there will be liquidity available on the exchange or that the market price will be in line with the NAV [net asset value] or the principal market NAV at any given time,” it states. An excerpt from the S-1 Form for 21Shares Sui ETF. Source: SEC The filing highlighted that the ETF aims to provide exposure to SUI by holding the tokens directly, without utilizing leverage, derivatives or engaging in speculative trading. Canary Capital was the first to file for Sui ETF 21Shares is not the first company to file for a Sui ETF in the US. Canary Capital, a US-based crypto investment firm, filed a Form S-1 registration for a spot Sui ETF on March 17. Subsequently, Cboe BZX Exchange asked US regulators for clearance to list Canary’s Sui ETF in early April. Sui-based ETPs have already been trading in Europe, with some of such products including 21Shares Sui staking ETP and VanEck Sui ETP.

The move will allow users on the social messaging app to send, save, and spend USDe on the platform. Ethena touts the integration as one of its biggest, as it allows millions of people to access the yield-bearing stablecoin. Telegram has around one billion users, and Ethena is hoping to leverage this to expand the distribution of its products. It said: “Telegram has truly global distribution across its billion users, with presence in emerging economies in regions like Asia, Africa, and Latin America Users within these countries can now all benefit from a globally accessible dollar savings vehicle via Ethena’s USDe right within their Telegram app.” The partnership with TON will enable Ethena to integrate USDe into all the major TON non-custodial wallets and the in-built custodial Telegram Wallet. USDe will be usable on all decentralized finance protocols on TON, allowing it to save for multiple DeFi purposes. Telegram users can also stake their USDe and get Ton Staked USDe (tsUSDe) to earn rewards. Beyond the yield on staked USDe, holders of tsUSDE may also get up to 10% APY on their holdings up to 10,000 tsUSDE. However, these extra rewards are only for eligible users, and the firm has not made the criteria public. Ethena’s partnership is in line with its roadmap Meanwhile, the integration with Telegram is in line with the roadmap that the stablecoin issuer published in January. In the roadmap , the protocol’s founder, Guy Young, said it will offer a neobank experience through Telegram, and this will enable it to compete with Tether as a key protocol in the DeFi ecosystem. It reiterated this potential in its latest announcement, noting that saving accounts through messaging apps is not a new development. According to Ethena Labs, digital money market funds from Alibaba and Tencent had $265 billion in deposits from 850 million users at their peak. USDe believes it can replicate this success on Telegram when users who are fleeing inflationary local currencies can easily onboard and earn yield on their dollar savings. It said: “Our integration within TON provides a similar user experience to these funds with the added benefits of the superior APY profile of sUSDe compared to risk free rates.” Beyond the savings, Ethena is also planning to enable direct payments integration for USDe with Apple Pay and debit cards. However, it intends to launch a TON debit card that will allow users to spend their tsUSDe rewards by the summer. Ethena integration could boost TON Meanwhile, the news of the partnership represents a positive development for the TON blockchain, which has seen its activity decline since mid-2024. The network was one of the best performers in the early part of last year due to the success of click-to-earn games, which attracted millions of users hoping to cash out from airdrops. However, activity has declined after interest in the mini-games waned due to disappointing airdrop rewards. With that, the TON network has seen limited activity, with decentralized exchange (DEX) volume plunging and transactions also taking a hit. TON DEX trading volume has seen consecutive declines since November 2024 (Source: Dune Analytics) According to Defillama , metrics such as chain fees and app revenue have tanked significantly, while total value locked (TVL) fell to $133.5 million from a peak of $775 million in July 2024. The poor network performance has affected the native TON token, which is trading at $3.175 after dropping 42.28% year-to-date and down 61.5% from its peak price in June 2024. Interestingly, not even the positive news of the Ethena partnership and the general uptrend in the price of cryptocurrencies has impacted TON’s performance today, as it fell 2% in the last 24 hours.

The country has been saying it wants to be a crypto hub since 2022, before the current Labour government was elected, yet only this week did it start seeking comments on draft legislation for the industry. The European Union, meanwhile, has already implemented its Markets in Crypto Assets legislation (MiCA), which provides a uniform regime across the bloc, and the new U.S. administration of President Donald Trump is promoting the industry and relaxing regulation. “If I look at the speed of innovation, I do feel that the U.S. is ahead — although they have their own challenges. But look at Singapore, Hong Kong — again, you see much more rapid innovation,” Jaidev Janardana, the CEO of digital bank Zopa, told CNBC. “I think we are still ahead of the EU, but we can’t remain complacent with that.” Trump, for his part, has been urging departments to make crypto-friendly policies, and stablecoin legislation is working its way through the Senate. The stablecoin sector could surge 10-fold to reach $2 trillion within three years following the passage of the legislation, Standard Chartered has forecast. “Other jurisdictions have started to seize the opportunity,” said Cassie Craddock, the managing director for U.K. and Europe at blockchain firm Ripple, in an interview with CNBC. Mark Fairless, CEO of payments infrastructure firm ClearBank, said his business has been looking to develop its own stablecoin and has been held back by the lack of regulatory clarity. Stablecoins are “part of our medium-term, longer-term strategy,” Fairless told CNBC. “We see ourselves well set up for that.” However, he added, a ClearBank stablecoin will be possible only once there’s clarity from U.K. regulators including the Bank of England. Still, the country hasn't entirely missed the bus. ""The U.K. is still that great place to set up. We have all the ingredients there, because we’ve got the ecosystem, we do have this talent setting up new businesses,"" Lisa Jacobs, CEO of business lending platform Funding Circle, said. ""But it needs to continue. We can’t rest on our laurels."" “I think the U.K. will get it right — but there is a risk if you get it wrong that you drive innovation to other markets,” Keith Grose, Coinbase's U.K. head, told CNBC.

Celebrity Memecoins Are Driving Crypto Market Growth According to a BDC Consulting market report, the memecoin market grew by 46% in 2024 , cementing its position as one of the fastest-growing niches in cryptocurrency. This surge has been largely driven by the rise of celebrity tokens , which have attracted a new wave of engagement from individuals who would otherwise be uninterested in crypto. The average person is becoming more willing to engage with the market, getting people who would otherwise be uninvolved in cryptocurrency more actively participating. Top 20 Celebrity Memecoins People Want to See Next Here are the top 20 celebrity memecoins people want to see next, ranked: Ranking Metrics The celebrities were ranked based on three key metrics depicting public interest in potential memecoins: Google Trends : Interest in the largest celebrities worldwide Keywordtool.io Searches : Searches for the term “X Celebrity meme coin” in the past year Keywordtool.io Searches : Searches for the term “X Celebrity Crypto” in the past year Top-Ranked Celebrities Lionel Messi topped the ranking, narrowly edging out LeBron James by just one point, with a score of 67 out of 100 . Sports stars like Messi hold significant influence, inspiring generations and connecting with fans on a global scale, making them prime candidates for memecoin launches. Celebrities from the music industry and social media influencers also wield considerable power. The rest of the top five include: Kim Kardashian and Justin Bieber (tied for third place with a score of 50 ) Taylor Swift (fifth place with a score of 47 ) These pop icons, with vast and dedicated fanbases, are well-positioned for memecoins aimed at younger demographics. The Influence of Memecoins in Politics The rise of memecoins demonstrates their potential to extend beyond entertainment and into the political sphere . The launch of Donald Trump’s $TRUMP coin , despite sparking controversy, helped boost his popularity among younger people and the crypto community. It played a key role in his path to the presidency, underlining how memecoins can shape public perception and wield significant influence.

The upgrade was approved through the network’s on-chain governance process , with participation from validators and community members, and aims to enhance staking flexibility, support growth on Layer 2, and strengthen the network’s validator framework. A key feature of the Rio upgrade is a reduction in the Tezos’ ( XTZ ) cycle length—from approximately three days to just one, according to a note shared with crypto.news. This change significantly shortens the time users must wait when moving funds between staking and other network activities, such as interacting with decentralized applications. The shorter cycle is expected to improve user experience across Web3 services by making staking more accessible and responsive. Future upgrades may further reduce unstaking wait times, according to protocol developers.

The DAL is designed to improve scalability by increasing the volume of transaction data that can be published on-chain by up to 4,000 times, while reducing the costs for rollup-based applications like Etherlink. With Rio, the protocol now allocates 10% of baking rewards to bakers participating in DAL, creating a direct incentive to support L2 scaling. To improve network reliability, Rio introduces stricter inactivity thresholds for bakers. Under the new rules, bakers who remain unresponsive for more than two days are marked inactive and temporarily lose their consensus rights. This measure is designed to reduce the risk of slowdowns and increase the network’s overall resilience. The upgrade was developed collaboratively by Nomadic Labs, Trilitech, and Functori, and is part of Tezos’ ongoing approach to self-amending upgrades and community-led governance.

A V-shaped recovery is a bullish pattern formed when an asset rises sharply after a steep decline. It is completed when the price moves up to the resistance at the top of the V formation, also known as the neckline. SOL appears to be on a similar trajectory and now trades below a supply-demand zone between $160 and $200, where the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) sits. The bulls need to push the price above this area to increase the chances of reaching the neckline at $250 to complete the V-shaped pattern.

In the meantime, Yeti Ouro (YETIO) netizens are seeing a constant rise in presale prices, with the current stage value now pegged at $0.041 whilst it anchors its GameFi focus ( 5.8M Q1 2025 daily users ). XRP Price Wobbles Are Causing Worry XRP’s close puts it at a −0.46 z-Bollinger score, which is precariously poised in between the middle line and the lower envelope ($2.1647) since volatility starts to tighten following the broadening of the past week. Momentum is now bearish. MACD has just registered a negative crossover—the fast line at 0.0180 has dropped below the indicator at 0.0252 and sent the histogram down to −0.0072. Historically, a first-cross on this chart takes price another 0.9 σ deeper into the outer band during the next two candles 62% of the time, with implications of probabilistic support at $2.18–$2.20 should volume be in confirmation. Volume increased on the recent downtick and is suggestive of supply rotation. On a quant-risk basis the skew is symmetrical but kurtosis has increased in favour of momentum fades over pure breakout plays. Conservatively wait for a lower-band probe and a stoch-divergent recovery before re-engaging longs via $2.1647 as validation point and $2.30 as near-term mean-reversion goal. In contrast, persistent breaks below the band would negate the medium-term bull thesis and expose the way for XRP price to the previous value area at $2.11. CryptoQuant’s chart reveals that XRP addresses in use fell from 110K in December to roughly 22K, an 80% drop . Future statistics also reflect the cooling down: open interest and leverage estimates stand 70% below their peaks, and funding temporarily turned negative. Nonetheless, the price fell only 35%, with reserves on exchanges at multi-month lows, showing coins exiting platforms. This combination of decreased speculation, falling supply on exchanges, and price resiliency indicates there may be bullish pressure waiting to build once network activity reverts to normal. YETIO’s Stage 4 Presale is Causing a Stir Among Investors Yeti Ouro’s $YETIO is a newly audited ERC-20 token that combines meme with solid utility. Supply is capped at 1 billion coins and is currently at presale stage 4 at $0.041. Around $3.8 million have been raised to date, and buyers over $500 receive a 25% bonus. Early backers from Stage 1 of the presale are seeing a 242% ROI with the price increase from $0.012 to $0.041 in Stage 4. SOLIDProof has cleared the contract and the tokenomics pool directs emissions to staking, yield farming, liquidity incentives, and to a community fund that drives a self-sustaining in-game economy. Utility is drawn from Yeti Go, a Play-to-Earn elimination racer being built on the FMOD/Unreal Engine 5 stack. Yeti Go isn’t just another racing game—it’s a sensory experience built for speed and style. Developed in collaboration with the renowned studio behind iconic franchises like Call of Duty, Spider-Man, The Witcher, and Dead Space, it delivers polished visuals and high-intensity gameplay. What truly elevates it is the sound—crafted by expert engineers who’ve worked with Grammy-nominated artists such as Major Lazer, Vybz Kartel, and Kabaka Pyramid—bringing emotion, rhythm, and drive to every turn. Players compete in live competition to earn YETIO that can be redeemed to equip higher-level gear or staked to earn more yield. The roadmap reserves a space for an initial listing and alpha drop before a cross-platform public beta and complete mobile release, cementing steady demand with each phase opening higher staking and yielding options. NFT garage drops, seasonal tournaments, and partner-brand sponsorships integrate into the economic loop to give multiple demand sinks that disentangle token value from purely speculative market cycles. Scroll down to meet the game’s lead character and step into its universe where adrenaline and artistry collide. Comparing YETIO to XRP Relative to XRP, YETIO has more acute token economics and a greater upside. Supply of XRP is 100 billion—one hundred times greater—and in December, a network upgrade increased base fees twenty times from 10 to 200 drops (0.00001→0.0002 XRP) to prevent spam. That charge is infinitesimal, yet it points to the mature, slower-growth trajectory in which token holders count on price appreciation and fractional fee burns to drive value. In contrast to that model, YETIO combines scarcity with productive yield; gamers burn and lock tokens to earn in-race speed-ups and staking rewards, reducing circulating float and yielding cash-flow-like incentives. Add the low float to an early-stage market cap, and YETIO provides a risk-adjusted upside story higher than that of the established payments rail of XRP.

While sellers seem to be running out, there is still enough pressure to keep the bulls at bay. This continuous beating down of the Bitcoin price, as well as its failure to make a notable break above resistance at $95,800 in the last few days, suggests there is more to be done. So, what happens when Bitcoin does make a definite breakout? Bitcoin Price Could Sweep Liquidity At $93,000 With the Bitcoin price being beaten down, there is the possibility that the cryptocurrency could fall a bit further before resuming its uptrend. This was explained by crypto analyst TehThomas on a TradingView post, mapping out the possible directions of Bitcoin, with both hinging on two major levels. Related Reading: XRP Mega Candle On The Horizon? Analyst Reiterates $27 Target The first of the major levels mentioned was the resistance at $95,400-$95,800 that has been holding back the Bitcoin price from its campaign for $100,000. The analyst explains that this has become an important level to beat, given the fact that it has rejected the price multiple times already. As a result, there has been the formation of a range just underneath this resistance level as bulls seem to be backing down. However, regardless of the loss in momentum, the crypto analyst explains that the broader trend structure is still the same. This means that the Bitcoin price is still bullish, especially with a higher timeframe ascending trend line and the formation of higher lows recently. The one roadblock faced by the Bitcoin price from here is the possibility of it falling to do a liquidity sweep at the $93,000-$93,800 levels. A successful sweep and a rebound from here would see adequate absorption of liquidity, which would be used to fuel a higher price rise. Thomas explains that “This zone is confluenced by the ascending trendline from previous swing lows, offering a clear area for a liquidity sweep.” Bullish Or Bearish Scenario Next? In terms of where the Bitcoin price is headed next, it comes down to the liquidity sweep and if resistance is broken. As Thomas explains, a drop to the $93,000-$93,800 level for liquidity is most likely at this point to sweep out late longs and introduce fresh liquidity into the market. “A dip into this level that still respects the trendline would maintain bullish structure despite violating the local higher low.” Related Reading: Ethereum Price Completes Structure Break As Buyers Take Control, Why A Surge Above $4,400 Is Possible On the flip side, if the Bitcoin price were to fall lower than $93,000, then the sweep could be unsuccessful. This would lead to a break in the bull structure and likely cause the price to collapse further. “In the worst case scenario possibly invalidating the breakout thesis temporarily.” Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|SPONSORED|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-05-01 14:00:10

Is DOGE a good investment? Dogecoin has strong potential for growth due to its high adoption and strong community. However, DOGE is highly volatile and its unlimited supply raises questions about its future price. Social media news and trends also highly affect the meme coin, so diversification and research are advised. The coin is expected to touch the $0.491 level by 2026. Why is DOGE up? DOGE’s price increased to $0.1790 over the last 24 hours. DOGE is yet to overcome the strong resistance at the $0.1903 mark. What is the expected value of Dogecoin in 2025? Dogecoin is expected to trade at an average price of $0.263401 in 2025. Will DOGE reach $0.50? If the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish, DOGE will join the rally. As a meme coin, it runs mostly on positive speculation. It’s expected that the coin will touch this level by January 2027. Will DOGE reach $1? Considering Dogecoin’s current value, $1 is still a far-reaching target. However, robust community support for this meme coin can push it to $1 by 2029. Will DOGE hit $10? Despite the risk involved with meme-based crypto pairs like Dogecoin, they can still shoot up on positive momentum. However, the market speculates that DOGE cannot reach the $10 level in the foreseeable future. How much is $500 worth of Dogecoin right now? $500 is worth nearly 2,849.48 DOGE in May; however, this amount changes based on day-to-day price fluctuations. Does DOGE have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but looking at DOGE, it’s trading above its average price of the last two years. Currently, the coin is following a downward pattern since it peaked at $0.414 on January 17, 2025, but the trend is expected to change, and a positive outbreak can be expected. The DOGE/USD pair is expected to reach the $1.37 mark by 2031, so holding it for longer can be beneficial.

Our analysis shows that DOGE could cross $1.31 by 2031. Dogecoin historic price sentiment DOGE price history 2013 was the beginning of Dogecoin, and it surged to $0.0004 in the first days of trading. By March 2014, the coin attempted a breach of $0.001 but failed, closing the year at $0.0001. In the subsequent years, Dogecoin faced immense competition from new coins, including Stellar, Neo, and Monero, which dragged the coin’s price further down. According to the Dogecoin price history, it traded in a strict range of $0.002 to $0.0036 for most of 2019. In January 2021, DOGE saw significant gains, closing the month at $0.037. Subsequently, Dogecoin attained an ATH of $0.7376 on May 8, 2021, but lost 76% of its value, closing the year at $0.1703. In 2022, Dogecoin maintained an average market price of about $0.07. The coin began trading around $0.08 in 2023 and closed the year at $0.08955. In 2024, Dogecoin (DOGE) began consolidating around $0.08, surged above $0.2 during March’s bull run, fluctuated between $0.1011 and $0.1759 through mid-year, spiked to $0.4312 in November, and ended the year at $0.314. In January 2025, DOGE clocked the highest price of $0.41; however, after shedding 38% value, it stepped down to $0.258 in February. In March, DOGE’s value decreased further as it dipped to the $0.20 range, and April saw the lowest DOGE price of $0.142. However, at the start of May, Dogecoin is trading near the $0.170 mark, following some improvement.",Crypto Price Predictions|DOGE,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|MINING|SPONSORED|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-01 14:00:39

XRP , Solana (SOL) , Optimism (OP) , and Injective (INJ) are each showing key signals that suggest upside ahead—ranging from breakout formations to infrastructure expansion. Whether trading with $1,230 or simply looking for value, these tokens are gaining ground for a reason. XRP and Solana Stay in Focus XRP holds its position around $2.15 , with momentum supported by increased institutional access through futures ETF products. Traders are watching the $2.45 level closely, where a breakout could renew demand and set off a wave of short-term price action. Underlying volume remains strong, making XRP a name that continues to lead strategic conversations. Solana (SOL) is trading between $140 and $145 , still benefitting from institutional exposure and long-term developer interest. The key level to watch is $180 —a confirmed breakout above that could trigger a strong continuation move, especially as user activity and ecosystem growth remain high. Optimism and Injective Build Quiet Momentum Optimism (OP) , priced near $3.25 , remains a major player in Ethereum’s Layer 2 scene. While OP hasn’t surged recently, its infrastructure use and developer adoption continue to expand steadily. A slight uptick in Ethereum price could provide the catalyst Optimism needs to start climbing again. Injective (INJ) , valued at approximately $35 , has held firm as one of the more technically resilient altcoins in this cycle. Its core strength lies in supporting decentralized trading infrastructure, and investor confidence has remained high even without fresh headlines. INJ’s momentum looks to be building beneath the surface. ACT NOW — BIGGEST EVENT OF THE DECADE!

Crystal Intelligence to Acquire Whale Alert’s Scam Reporting Platform to Fight Crypto Scams Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but the acquisition is expected to close by the end of May. Once completed, Scam Alerts will operate as an independent, non-commercial entity within Crystal Intelligence. “Scam victims often have no recourse,” said Navin Gupta, CEO of Crystal Intelligence and former Ripple executive. “Scam Alert gives them a way to make their voices heard.” Gupta added that every fraud report submitted through the platform contributes to a clearer understanding of fraud tactics and distribution patterns, providing critical information for law enforcement and investigators. Scam Alerts allows crypto users to report scams, helping to map and analyze fraud schemes. With this acquisition, Crystal plans to streamline fraud reporting, expand multilingual support, and create a stronger support framework for victims. The firm also plans to improve coordination with global law enforcement and local blockchain communities. “Localization means more than just language for us; it’s about cultural context, regional scam models, and trusted community partners,” said Marina Khaustova, COO of Crystal. Whale Alert will remain as an advisory partner following the acquisition and will continue to contribute expertise to the development of the platform. Crystal Intelligence says its broader goal is to help make the crypto space safer and more trustworthy. *This is not investment advice.

Announced on May 1 via a press release shared with crypto.news, the alliance will focus on building technical infrastructure that supports privacy -preserving AI systems. At the core of the project is the proposed Intention Network Protocol which aims to enable AI agents to collaborate securely without compromising user control over personal data. INP is structured around three key components: “Intention Anchors” to capture user inputs with data ownership guarantees; the “Intention Mesh,” a decentralized environment for AI communication; and “Execution Nodes,” which act on user intentions with built-in privacy protections. The alliance also outlined a broader roadmap that includes decentralized data storage, open-source AI models, and tools for AI agents to transact and collaborate autonomously. According to the founders, this effort is meant to move the data economy from “attention-based” to “intention-based,” with users at the center.

Fraser Edwards, CEO of cheqd, told crypto.news in an interview that current AI models often trade in user data without meaningful consent. “Users pay with their personal data, which is extracted, aggregated, and commodified,” he said. The alliance’s approach, according to Edwards, enables users to selectively share data, potentially monetize it, and maintain the ability to revoke access, offering a level of control that centralized platforms struggle to provide. While previous efforts to “pay users for data” have stumbled, SAIA’s architecture is designed to treat user data as a reusable and verifiable asset within a consent-based ecosystem. It also includes compliance-focused tools, such as audit trails and selective disclosure, to help applications meet global privacy standards like GDPR. A full Q&A with Fraser Edwards on SAIA’s plans, challenges, and user incentives follows below.

That sounds interesting in theory, but what advantages will this deliver over Big Tech’s AI offerings? AI services are offered for free “for free” by trading their data and this has been accepted as normal for years by the vast majority of people. Why would users and developers switch to a self-sovereign model? What real incentive (monetary, privacy, or otherwise) makes your user-owned data approach compelling enough to drive adoption? Fraser Edwards: The core advantage of the Sovereign AI Alliance’s model is alignment. AI that works for you, not for platforms monetising your attention or data. Today’s “free” AI tools aren’t truly free. Users pay with their personal data, which is extracted, aggregated, and commodified, often in ways that can’t be controlled or audited. This fuels engagement driven systems that prioritise virality and retention over individual benefit. A real world example is the backlash against Meta’s AI being embedded into WhatsApp. Despite Meta’s claims of respecting privacy, users can’t turn it off, and few trust the company to act in their best interests. This erodes confidence in Big Tech’s data stewardship. In contrast, Sovereign AI is built around user-owned data, where individuals control how their information is used, shared, and monetised. The self-sovereign model empowers people to own their digital selves in a way that Big Tech can’t offer without dismantling its entire business model. For AI to be truly personalised and useful, it needs access to rich, cross-contextual data with full permission. If data is siloed across platforms, AI remains limited and impersonal. Sovereign AI enables intelligent systems that are both more powerful and more respectful of the people they serve. This model enables three incentives to drive adoption: Privacy by Design: Data isn’t siphoned into opaque corporate systems. Instead, it remains in users’ control via decentralised identity and storage infrastructure. Monetary Incentive: With frameworks like cheqd’s payment rails, users and developers can receive compensation for sharing verified data or training AI agents, creating a real data economy. Real Personalisation: Personal AIs and agents, like those being developed by DataHive, can act on your behalf based on your true intentions, not what maximises ad revenue.” CN: A core idea here is that individuals control (and potentially monetize) their own data. However, many past projects promised “get paid for your data” and struggled, partly because an average user’s data isn’t worth much at an individual level or worth the time. How will SAIA change that equation? Are you planning to reward users directly for contributing data or AI training feedback, or is the benefit more indirect (e.g. better personalization and privacy)? If users can’t earn significant income, what’s the draw for them to proactively share and manage their data in this network? FE: It’s true that past “get paid for your data” models often failed because they treated data like a one-off commodity rather than part of an ongoing, intent driven ecosystem. The Sovereign AI Alliance changes the equation by reimagining data as a reusable, high-value asset within a decentralised, intention-based AI framework. For cheqd, we approach this by enabling individuals to control and reuse their own data, but just as importantly, we’re building the infrastructure that incentivises companies and data siloes to release that data back to individuals in the first place. Rather than promising quick micro rewards for isolated data points, cheqd’s infrastructure supports a model where users can selectively share verified, reusable data, such as credentials, preferences, or consent, on their terms. This opens up the potential for more meaningful long term value, whether that’s in personalised AI services, selective monetisation, or simply better control. The real shift is in rebalancing power: making it viable for users to take their data with them and use it across different AI systems, without being trapped in siloes.” CN: With user-owned data at the center, how are you addressing privacy and compliance from the start? If personal data is being used to train or inform AI models, do users have fine-grained control and the ability to opt-out or revoke data? Recent regulatory actions show this is critical – e.g. Italy’s data protection authority temporarily banned ChatGPT over the “absence of any legal basis” for its mass collection of personal data for training. How will SAIA’s approach differ in handling user data so that it remains compliant with privacy laws (GDPR and others) and ethical norms? FE: Compliance and privacy are fundamental to SAIA’s architecture. The foundation of SAIA is user sovereignty by default, without the need for central data silos, in contrast to typical AI models that collect data in bulk without meaningful consent. Data stays under user control Users can grant, revoke, or limit access to their data at any time leveraging decentralised identity (cheqd) and storage protocols (Datagram and others). This mechanism is in line with GDPR notions like data minimisation and the right to be forgotten. Consent is explicit and revocable We are developing systems that allow users to express explicit consent to the usage of their data, such as for credential sharing, agent interactions, or AI training. With verifiable consent records and intention-specific use cases, legal foundation and traceability are guaranteed. Built-in compliance tooling We’re creating embedded compliance features, like audit trails, data provenance, and selective disclosure, so that AI agents and applications using SAIA’s framework are not just privacy-aligned but provably compliant with global regulations.” CN: cheqd brings decentralized identity (self-sovereign identity / SSI) and verification infrastructure to the alliance. How will SSI be included into the AI framework? For instance, will Intention Anchors use digital identities to verify data provenance or the reputation of AI agents? And given that decentralized identity is still nascent, even identity experts note that adoption is the biggest challenge due to added complexity for users and organizations​, how will you encourage and bootstrap the use of SSI within SAIA? FE: “SSI plays a key role in the Sovereign AI Alliance’s architecture. It is the layer of trust that connects AI agents, people, and data. Here is how we intend to get beyond adoption obstacles and how cheqd’s decentralised identity infrastructure fits into the framework. This also applies to AI agents themselves: by issuing verifiable credentials to agents, we can establish reputation, capability, and authenticity.

Wallets, decentralized applications (DApps) , block explorers and smart contracts follow different rules. “The result? A messy, inconsistent experience that breaks cross-chain UX,“ Wonderland stated. Wonderland is a group of developers, researchers and data scientists focused on improving the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem. The organization partnered with multiple DeFi protocols, including Optimism, Aztec, Connext and Yearn. Wonderland’s ERC-7828 and ERC-7930 explanation post. Source: Wonderland In the post, the organization shared what was discussed at a recent Ethereum Foundation interoperability working group call. Teddy from Wonderland explained that the current goal is to finalize both token standards within the next two weeks. He added: “We badly need feedback on the ETH-Magicians forum.” Related: Vitalik Buterin’s vision for Ethereum: Pectra, Glamsterdam and beyond Something for people, something for bots Wonderland explained that “ ERC-7930 defines a compact, binary format for interoperable addresses.” This format is machine-friendly and optimized for protocols that require a single representation for all blockchains. ERC-7828 expands that standard “by adding a human-readable layer, using formats like address@chain, ensuring everything stays clear and simple for users.” Together, the two are designed to enhance the experience of using Ethereum’s inter-blockchain ecosystem. “Target audience for ERC-7828 is anything that interacts with humans… It’s the text layer,” Teddy said during the call. Related: Ethereum Fusaka hard fork set for late 2025 Many chains, one address Put simply, the proposed system would allow the sender to specify the target blockchain when sending a payment address. This would include both a human-readable address@chain format and a machine-readable format for application programming interfaces. The setup prevents users from sending or receiving assets on the wrong blockchain, which helps prevent crypto losses. Currently, the same address can be used on multiple blockchains within the Ethereum ecosystem, which can lead to confusion. With the new setup, wallet operation can be blockchain-agnostic, and the address input into the user interface will also determine which blockchain the transaction is directed toward. This would, in turn, reduce friction, as users currently need to switch networks in wallet settings to move from chain to chain.

Price Prediction After Utility Token Plans Revealed",https://cryptonews.com/news/can-trump-coin-explode-1000-price-prediction-after-utility-token-plans-revealed/,"Trump Coin has risen by 3% today, with the meme token’s move to $13.40 coming as the crypto market dips by 0.5% in the past 24 hours. TRUMP is now up by 10.5% in a week and by 72% in the past fortnight, although the token remains down by 81% in relation to its ATH of $73.43 (set in January). Yet the past couple of weeks have been promising for the meme coin, with President Donald Trump boosting its price via an offer of a private dinner to the token’s 220 biggest holders. And with Trump’s media group now planning the launch of a utility token for its streaming service, Truth+, it’s possible that TRUMP Coin will continue its climb over the coming weeks. Can TRUMP Coin Explode 1,000%? Price Prediction After Utility Token Plans Revealed Writing in a letter to shareholders , the Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. revealed plans to expand Truth+, including adding a subscription service with “premium content.” The letter also revealed that the media group is weighing up the possibility of adding “a utility token within a Truth digital wallet” that will pay for “Truth+ subscription costs,” while later being usable for “other products and services in the Truth ecosphere.” Trump media, TRUTH, is seriously exploring launching a utility token soon Big whales eat shrimps kinda play maybe pic.twitter.com/7VCIv0Iy9i — Dippy.eth (@dippy_eth) April 29, 2025 The letter did not confirm that this will definitely happen, instead acknowledging only that the group is “exploring” the option of a utility token. Still, what it shows is a serious intent to delve deeper into the crypto ecosystem, and potentially to do things that will support the growth and price of Official Trump (TRUMP) itself. And the market appears to have taken the news in this way, with the chart for TRUMP Coin showing a recovery in momentum today. After dropping below yesterday, the token’s RSI (purple) has begun rising towards 50, from where it could easily push to higher levels. Source: TradingView We also see that TRUMP’s 30-period average (orange) has stopped its descent, with the token’s price likely to climb over the indicator very soon, signalling a potential breakout. Given its momentum, Trump Coin could reach $15 in the next couple of weeks, before working its way back to $20 by the second half of the year. Its growth in the second half of the year will depend on macroeconomics, with a return to open trade likely to see TRUMP hit $40. With that kind of upside in play, a 1,000% move no longer seems out of the question. Fresh Altcoin Gaining Traction as Traders Hunt the Next Breakout One argument against Trump Coin is that its biggest move may already be behind it. No amount of lip service to boosting ‘utility’ or expanding its ecosystem is going to change what it really is, which is a meme token. If so, some traders may already want to look for the next viral altcoin, one which could outperform the market as it weathers the current period of uncertainty. There are several presale coins which are promising in this regard, with one of the newest being Subbd (SUBBD) , which has now raised just over $290,000 in its sale. Spotted: a shiny new token making its debut – and no, it’s not just another coin with a cute name. $SUBBD presale is now officially live. And between us? Early buyers don’t just get perks… they get power. You know where to find it. https://t.co/8yAMjVQD5E pic.twitter.com/g33ipi9kp2 — SUBBD (@SUBBDofficial) April 3, 2025 What’s interesting about Subbd is that it’s launching an AI- and crypto-based adult content creation platform, one that is aiming to take on incumbents such as Only Fans. On the one hand, the use of crypto and smart contracts will ensure fair and transparent payments for content creators, with the use of NFTs also enabling them to monetize their posts. On the other hand, Subbd will provide AI-based tools that users can harness to aid and enhance their content creation, from the generation of ideas to the actual creation of content. This combination of features positions Subbd very nicely to grow once it launches in the next few months, at a time when adult content platforms remain hugely popular. Investors can join SUBBD’s presale now by going to the SUBBD website and connecting a compatible wallet, such as Best Wallet. The coin currently costs $0.0553, although this will continue to rise every few days, until the sale ends. The post Can TRUMP Coin Explode 1,000%?

44027549,https://blog.kraken.com/?p=28231,1746108510,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/98/default.png,How we identified a North Korean hacker who tried to get a job at Kraken,https://blog.kraken.com/news/how-we-identified-a-north-korean-hacker,"Every day, our dedicated security and IT teams successfully repel a wide range of attacks from various bad actors. From our years of experience, we know how vast the attack vectors of any major company are. And as we’re disclosing today, they can include unexpected areas, such as the company’s recruitment process. Our teams recently identified a North Korean hacker’s attempts to infiltrate our ranks by applying for a job at Kraken. Watch CBS News’ full coverage of how Kraken identified — and then strategically interacted with — a North Korean hacker who tried to get a job at Kraken What started as a routine hiring process for an engineering role quickly turned into an intelligence gathering operation, as our teams carefully advanced the candidate through our hiring process to learn more about their tactics at every stage of the process. This is an established challenge for the crypto community, with estimates indicating that North Korean hackers stole over $650 million from crypto firms in 2024 alone. We’re disclosing these events today as part of our ongoing transparency efforts and to help companies, both in crypto and beyond, to strengthen their defenses. The candidate’s red flags From the outset, something felt off about this candidate. During their initial call with our recruiter, they joined under a different name from the one on their resume, and quickly changed it. Even more suspicious, the candidate occasionally switched between voices, indicating that they were being coached through the interview in real time. Before this interview, industry partners had tipped us off that North Korean hackers were actively applying for jobs at crypto companies. We received a list of email addresses linked to the hacker group, and one of them matched the email the candidate used to apply to Kraken. With this intelligence in hand, our Red Team launched an investigation using Open-Source Intelligence gathering (OSINT) methods. One method involved analyzing breach data, which hackers often use to identify users with weak or reused passwords. In this instance, we discovered that one of the emails associated with the malicious candidate was part of a larger network of fake identities and aliases. This meant that our team had uncovered a hacking operation where one individual had established multiple identities to apply for roles in the crypto space and beyond. Several of the names had previously been hired by multiple companies, as our team identified work-related email addresses linked to them. One identity in this network was also a known foreign agent on the sanctions list. As our team dug deeper into the candidate’s history and credentials, technical inconsistencies emerged The candidate used remote colocated Mac desktops but interacted with other components through a VPN, a setup commonly deployed to hide location and network activity. Their resume was linked to a GitHub profile containing an email address exposed in a past data breach. The candidate’s primary form of ID appeared to be altered, likely using details stolen in an identity theft case two years prior. By this point, the evidence was clear, and our team was confident this wasn’t just a suspicious job applicant, but a state-sponsored infiltration attempt. Turning the tables – how our team responded Instead of tipping off the applicant, our security and recruitment teams strategically advanced them through our rigorous recruitment process – not to hire, but to study their approach. This meant putting them through multiple rounds of technical infosec tests and verification tasks, designed to extract key details about their identity and tactics. The final round interview? A casual chemistry interview with Kraken’s Chief Security Officer (CSO) Nick Percoco and several other team members. What the candidate didn’t realize was that this was a trap – a subtle but deliberate test of their identity. Between standard interview questions, our team slipped in two-factor authentication prompts, such as asking the candidate to verify their location, hold up a government-issued ID, and even recommend some local restaurants in the city they claimed to be in. At this point, the candidate unraveled. Flustered and caught off guard, they struggled with the basic verification tests, and couldn’t convincingly answer real-time questions about their city of residence or country of citizenship. By the end of the interview, the truth was clear: this was not a legitimate applicant, but an imposter attempting to infiltrate our systems. Commenting on the events, CSO Nick Percoco, said: “Don’t trust, verify. This core crypto principle is more relevant than ever in the digital age. State-sponsored attacks aren’t just a crypto, or U.S. corporate, issue – they’re a global threat. Any individual or business handling value is a target, and resilience starts with operationally preparing to withstand these types of attacks.” Key takeaways Not all attackers break in, some try to walk through the front door. As cyber threats evolve, so must our security strategies. A holistic, proactive approach is critical to protect an organization. Generative AI is making deception easier, but isn’t foolproof. Attackers can trick parts of the hiring process, like a technical assessment, but genuine candidates will usually pass real-time, unprompted verification tests. Try to avoid patterns in the types of verification questions that hiring managers use. A culture of productive paranoia is key. Security isn’t just an IT responsibility. In the modern era, it’s an organizational mindset. By actively engaging this individual, we identified areas to strengthen our defenses against future infiltration attempts. The next time a suspicious job application comes through remember: Sometimes, the biggest threats come disguised as opportunities.

Data from blockchain analytics platform Cryptometheus shows Cardano ( ADA ) recorded 21,440 GitHub commits across 550 repositories, ranking it #1 in developer activity over the recent period. By contrast, Ethereum ( ETH ) saw 20,998 commits across 278 repositories. In the past 7 days, Cardano had 29 developers making 228 commits, compared to Ethereum’s 15 developers and 199 commits. This surge points to deeper ecosystem engagement and reflects growing confidence in Cardano’s long-term roadmap. Cardano’s technical analysis also indicates increasing bullish momentum. Currently trading at $0.70, ADA is positioned above the 20-day exponential moving average at $0.6764 and the simple moving average at $0.6640, both of which now serve as short-term support. Most short-term moving averages are flashing buy signals, although longer-term indicators — like the 100-day and 200-day SMAs — still lean bearish. This suggests ADA may be in the early stages of a possible breakout. Cardano price analysis. Credit: crypto.news Although mixed, momentum indicators lean positive. The relative strength index at 56.7 is still in neutral territory, leaving room for potential future growth, while the moving average convergence divergence at 0.0118 displays bullish signs. ADA might rise to $0.80 if it can break above $0.74. On the downside, it may return towards the $0.61 area if it falls below $0.66.

According to CoinCodex’s price prediction , Cardano could rise 8.88% by May 31, reaching $0.758, with the Fear & Greed Index currently sitting at 53, indicating neutral sentiment. Cardano’s roadmap may soon serve as a major catalyst. In an April 19 interview with The Angry Crypto Show, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson said the project is “playing very aggressively with Bitcoin DeFi,” aiming to become the go-to platform for Bitcoin-based decentralized finance. He added: “There’s already $5.8 billion in TVL from the Bitcoin side… If you get 5% or 10% of the supply, the TVL will be larger than Solana or Ethereum.” Hoskinson also confirmed plans for a Bitcoin ( BTC ) bridge and Lace wallet integration, which could open new liquidity flows and cross-chain opportunities for ADA holders. Meanwhile, speculation around ADA spot exchange-traded funds has intensified. Canary Capital and Grayscale’s applications are still being reviewed, and the Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to make a final decision by May 29. Since Paul Atkins was appointed SEC chair, optimism has grown, raising the likelihood of a favorable decision.

Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart now see a 75% or greater chance the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves a range of spot altcoin ETFs by the end of 2025. Eight separate spot fund proposals are currently in front of the SEC, including ETFs tied to solana (SOL), litecoin (LTC), dogecoin (DOGE), XRP, cardano (ADA), avalanche (AVAX), polkadot (DOT), and hedera (HBAR). Balchunas and Seyffart believe index and basket-style ETFs — which group multiple cryptocurrencies — have the highest odds of approval, pegging those chances at 90%. The first key deadline comes on July 2, when the SEC must respond to proposals filed by firms including Grayscale, Bitwise, Franklin Templeton, and Hashdex for basked-style funds. Decisions on single-asset ETFs like SOL, DOGE, XRP, and ADA are expected in October, with others following in November and December. These are final deadlines, meaning the SEC — which previously delayed decisions — will be required to issue a final rulings. Some issuers have submitted intent to launch funds tracking smaller-cap tokens such as SUI, Trump Coin (TRUMP), and Melania Coin (MELANIA), but these have not yet advanced to the formal 19b-4 stage — a requirement filing to trigger an SEC review. Seyffart noted that SUI’s chances could be on par with the other altcoin filings. “I need to dive in a bit more for an official odds number, but I’d assume it would have similar prospects to the other altcoin ETFs,” he said. The outlook for altcoin ETFs shifted sharply after U.S. President Donald Trump took office, and his appointment of crypto friendly Paul Atkins as SEC chairman. Atkins recently told industry participants that innovation “has been stifled” and the existing regulatory framework “badly needs attention.”",Markets|Crypto ETF|News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|DOGE|REGULATION|SOL|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-01 15:12:16

This forecast is rooted in the MVRV Pricing Bands, a key on-chain metric used to gauge Bitcoin’s fair value relative to market behavior. The analysis, shared in a recent X post by Ali, has sparked new discussions among traders and investors as Bitcoin enters what many consider to be a crucial phase in its current market cycle. If #Bitcoin $BTC breaks and holds above $95,870, the next key target, based on the MVRV Pricing Bands, is $114,230. pic.twitter.com/iKPJvVaUtA — Ali (@ali_charts) April 30, 2025 Understanding the $95,870 Resistance Level The $95,870 mark represents more than just a psychological barrier. It aligns with critical resistance identified in Bitcoin’s recent trading history and coincides with the upper threshold of several technical indicators, including Fibonacci extensions and volume-weighted price zones. Market participants are closely watching this level as a potential trigger point that could invalidate bearish structures and confirm the continuation of a bullish macro trend. Ali’s projection of $114,230 as the next major target reflects an optimistic but data-driven outlook. Using the MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) Pricing Bands, which track the average investor’s unrealized profit or loss, the forecast suggests that Bitcoin’s market valuation still has significant room for expansion without entering overheated territory. These bands historically help pinpoint cyclical tops and bottoms, giving this analysis a layer of statistical credibility. MVRV Pricing Bands: A Reliable On-Chain Indicator The MVRV Pricing Bands have become a staple for analysts assessing Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. By comparing the current market price to the average price paid by all coin holders (realized value), MVRV can indicate when BTC is overvalued or undervalued relative to its historical norms. Ali’s use of this tool in projecting the $114,230 level implies that the price target isn’t just speculative—it’s rooted in macroeconomic and behavioral patterns reflected on-chain. During previous cycles, such as the 2017 and 2021 bull markets, MVRV bands were instrumental in identifying when Bitcoin was poised to either correct or surge . Currently, with Bitcoin hovering below $96,000, it appears to be approaching a pivotal zone where renewed demand could catalyze a breakout. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Context and Macro Sentiment Ali’s analysis arrives at a time of increasing institutional interest in Bitcoin. With U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs gaining traction, broader capital inflows could soon reinforce technical signals like the ones outlined in the MVRV bands. Furthermore, the recent Bitcoin halving in April 2024 has reduced new supply entering the market, a fundamental catalyst that historically precedes price appreciation over the following months. Sentiment across the market remains cautiously optimistic. While volatility persists due to macroeconomic uncertainty and regulatory developments, on-chain metrics like MVRV offer a more stable lens through which to view price potential. If Bitcoin successfully breaks and holds above the $95,870 resistance, momentum could quickly build toward Ali’s projected $114,230 level, driven by both technical conviction and renewed investor confidence. Bitcoin on the Brink of a Breakout As Bitcoin consolidates near critical resistance, all eyes are on whether the market can sustain a move above $95,870. Ali’s forecast—anchored in the reliable MVRV Pricing Bands—offers a clear, data-backed vision of what may lie ahead: a run toward $114,230. Whether this scenario unfolds hinges on market conviction and liquidity, but the technical roadmap is now clearly laid out. In a landscape increasingly influenced by institutional capital and blockchain-based finance, Bitcoin’s next major move could shape the remainder of 2025’s market narrative.

Worldcoin ( WLD )’s U.S. launch has kicked off with plenty of positive price action — but that doesn’t necessarily make Worldcoin a buy. The digital-identity cryptocurrency associated with Sam Altman ’s World project seeks to counteract the ramifications of artificial intelligence (AI) by providing a tamper-proof way of verifying one’s identity online, and launched in the U.S. on May 1. WLD surged from $1.03 to $1.16, before mounting a retreat to $1.08 by press time on May 1, bringing returns on the daily chart to 4.31%. Within the last 7 days, Worldcoin has rallied by 19.78%.

Worldcoin launch marred by continually high concentration Moreover, the issue of concentration remains a hot topic. In August of 2023, just 10 wallets accounted for 98% of WLD’s total supply. Progress has been made on that front — but that’s not to say that the present state of affairs is satisfactory, either. Per data retrieved by Finbold from market intelligence platform CoinCarp on May 1, the top 10 holders of Worldcoin still control 77.62% of the token’s total supply. To boot, none of the 10 largest wallets belong to exchanges, with Binance’s wallet, the largest of its kind, being the 15th largest address and accounting for just 0.58% of supply.

Over the past 24 hours, the global cryptocurrency market capitalization has decreased by 0.6%, currently standing at $3.11 trillion. At the time of writing, the daily crypto trading volume is $111 billion, higher than what we’ve been observing over the past several days. In the top 10 coins category, all coins have turned green. Solana (SOL) has increased the most. It’s up 3.4% to $151.58. It’s followed by Dogecoin (DOGE)’s 3% to the current price of $0.1791. The smallest increase is 0.4% by Binance Coin (BNB) , which now trades at $603.57. At the same time, Bitcoin (BTC) appreciated 1.5%, currently changing hands at $96,254, slowly climbing back to the $100,000 mark. Ethereum (ETH) is up by 2.9%, now trading at $1,849. When it comes to the top 100 coins per market cap, only eight are red today. XDC Network (XDC) decreased the most: 2.1% to $0.07741. Next one is Optimism (OP) , which fell 1.7% to $0.7354.

The second highest gainer is Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) , which appreciated 12.6%, now trading at $1.25. Blockaid Now Helps Power Ledger’s New Transaction Check Onchain security platform Blockaid announced its integration as a technology provider for Transaction Check , a new feature from the major crypto wallet maker Ledger . Transaction Check, alongside Clear Signing, makes signing transactions on Ethereum and EVM chains safer, says the press release. It analyses a transaction for any potential threats. By powering Transaction Check as one of its integrations, Blockaid’s Transaction Security Engine enables Ledger users to independently check for known threats. This happens in real time before approving a transaction. Security at use starts with knowing what you sign. Introducing Transaction Check — Now live.

Users get either a green light or a warning, as well as a link to a full simulation report. Therefore, Transaction Check aims to reduce vulnerabilities associated with blind signing, which sees users unknowingly approving malicious or altered transactions, the team states. “By delivering real-time transaction simulation and cryptographically signed verification directly to Ledger devices, Blockaid and Ledger are closing a critical gap that attackers have repeatedly exploited,” the press release says.

Ten years ago, the state created the United States’ first comprehensive regulatory framework for firms dealing in cryptocurrencies, including key consumer protection, anti-money laundering compliance and cybersecurity guidelines. In September 2015, the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) issued its first BitLicense to Circle Internet Financial, enabling the company to conduct digital currency business activity in the state. Ripple Markets received the second BitLicense in 2016. Circle and Ripple went on to become giant players in the global cryptocurrency and stablecoin industry. Today, the NYDFS regulates one of the largest pools of crypto firms in the world, and it is often cited as the gold standard for crypto regulation in the US. It’s against that background that Ken Coghill, NYDFS’s deputy superintendent for virtual currencies, appeared at Cornell Tech’s blockchain conference on April 25 to discuss “A New Era of U.S. Innovation in Crypto.” “We set the guardrails” Most of the firms that have come to the NYDFS for a BitLicense are crypto-native firms, and often, they are new to the financial world and not used to dealing with regulators. Many times they don’t fully understand that they are in control of someone else’s asset, noted Coghill at the New York City conference, adding: If you want to start a business and the only person you’re putting at risk is your own business, that’s not really our concern. We only exist because you’re selling something to somebody else, and you’re maintaining control over that product for someone else. “We set the guardrails,” Coghill said, and it’s the industry’s job to figure out how to stay within those guardrails. The NYDFS can’t possibly contemplate every element that’s going to go wrong in a business. These days, more conventional financial institutions are becoming interested in crypto as well, added Coghill. Large banks are beginning to offer crypto custody services, and others are starting to provide settlement services. “The conventional [bank] model is being brought into the crypto [sphere] primarily because it makes people feel comfortable,” said Coghill. Related: Trump’s first 100 days ‘worst in history’ despite crypto promises And while the NYDFS has only issued 22 BitLicenses to date, it appears to be ready to handle a tide of applications from TradFi firms if and when they materialize. “On a per capita basis, we have more supervisory resources focused on crypto businesses than we do for all of those other [non-crypto] businesses,” said Coghill. This includes 3,000 banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions. Dubai’s crypto regulator It wasn’t a direct route that brought Coghill to the NYDFS in July 2024. He spent the previous 12 years in the Middle East working for the Dubai Financial Services Authority, eventually becoming the agency’s head of innovation and technology risk supervision. It was a “whim” that took him to the Middle East in the first place, he recalled. “I went for three years and stayed for 12 years,” spending that time primarily as an official regulating global systemically important banks, or G-SIBs. There, he was called upon to develop a cryptocurrency supervision model, and so he “spent the last six years regulating cryptocurrency in the Middle East.” The Dubai Financial Services Authority offices. Source: Condé Nast Eventually, an opportunity arose to return to the US, where he had worked earlier as a manager in the department of market regulation at the Chicago Board Options Exchange. Before that he was an options trader. He took the new assignment with the NYDFS, among other reasons, because “the world looks to New York, and the world looks to the DFS” when it comes to regulation, he told the Cornell Tech audience. Panel moderator Neil DeSilva asked Coghill what good regulation looks like. “Good regulation is regulation that doesn’t prohibit activity but that applies appropriate guardrails that reduces risk to clients,” he answered. One can’t eliminate risk entirely; to do so would quash all business activity. Related: Institutions break up with Ethereum but keep ETH on the hook He compares regulation to a pendulum constantly swinging between two extremes: too lenient and too restrictive. “The pendulum swung too far to one end of the regulation in the last few years [i.e., too restrictive]. Now it’s swinging back.” What does the state regulator make of the fevered regulatory activity in Washington, DC at the federal level these days? There seem to be some “positive tailwinds” behind cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, noted DeSilva, himself a former chief financial officer for PayPal’s Digital Currencies and Remittances business. A pipeline to Washington “For DFS, it’s largely business as usual,” Coghill commented. That’s because New York State has long had crypto rules in place. In fact, “much of what’s happening now in Washington” — at the federal level — “is influenced by what we’ve done over the last 10 years” at the state level. The state agency has regularly communicated with the powers-that-be in the US capital regarding digital currencies. “We have a team that practically sits in Washington and has discussions with Congressional members, talking about what we think will work and what won’t work.” The NYDFS’ crypto initiatives have influenced other US states. California’s crypto reform legislation (AB 1934), signed into law in late September 2024, for instance, builds on New York State’s BitLicense and its limited-purpose trust charter regulations for digital currency businesses — even though BitLicense’s licensing requirements are relatively strict. Not all in the crypto industry have been enamored with the state’s crypto licensing regime, either, declaring BitLicenses too expensive. Its application fee is $5,000 — too strict with its detailed anti-money laundering protocols and required audits and generally too much of an obstacle for innovative crypto-native firms. Crypto exchange Kraken exited the state when New York implemented its BitLicense requirement, for instance. Coghill was asked by DeSilva how the NYDFS actually looks at decentralized protocols compared with how it views the centralized financial institutions that it has historically regulated. It’s important to look at the actual purpose of the product, Coghill answered. What’s its underlying intent? Who does it serve, and what are its good and bad impacts? “There are lots of innovations that are created for no purpose other than making a lot of money off of its customers,” said Coghill. “And so it’s incumbent on us to filter those out.” “We’re paid to look at everything in a dark, dark way. It’s not our job to look at and say, ‘Yes, this is fantastic.’” Rather, they examine a potential product and ask, “How is this bad for efficiency?” or “How is this bad for inclusion?” How does he think things will play out at the federal level this year regarding crypto and stablecoin legislation? What’s going to ultimately happen [in Washington, DC]? Who knows? We could know six months from now. We could know things next week. Things have been changing very rapidly recently. In the meantime, “we’re still accepting applications. We’re still processing those applications. We’re still focusing on our underlying objectives: protecting the market, protecting the consumers, supporting innovation.” Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fig ht",,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-01 15:17:05

Bitcoin ( BTC ) jumped above $97,000, up by almost 30% from its lowest level in April. Its rally occurred as investors adopted a risk-on sentiment, with the Crypto Fear and Greed Index rising to 55. U.S. stocks also continued their upward momentum, with the Dow Jones and Nasdaq 100 indices both jumping by over 350 points. Below are the top three reasons why Bitcoin may be on its way to $100,000, and possibly an all-time high, in May. 1. Bitcoin price’s death cross pattern failed in April One major reason for optimism is that Bitcoin avoided forming a death cross pattern last month. A death cross occurs when the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average — typically a bearish signal. In April, the spread between these two averages narrowed significantly but ultimately did not cross. This mirrors what happened in September 2023, when a near-death cross preceded an 83% rally in BTC. A similar setup could signal another bullish surge. Bitcoin has other bullish technical catalysts that may push it above $100,000 and even its all-time high. It formed a double-bottom pattern at $76,560, and has now moved above the neckline at $88,830. It has also moved above the upper side of the small bullish flag pattern shown in yellow. Therefore, all these patterns indicate further gains in May. BTC price chart | Source: crypto.news You might also like: Cardano holds above key support as developer activity tops Ethereum 2. Bitcoin’s institutional demand is rising Another potential catalyst for Bitcoin is the growing number of institutions actively purchasing the coin. A notable example is that spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded net inflows of $2.9 billion in April, bringing cumulative inflows to over $39 billion. In addition, more companies are building and increasing their Bitcoin treasuries. Cantor Fitzgerald, Tether, and SoftBank have teamed up to create Twenty One , a company whose sole purpose is to buy Bitcoin. Other firms, such as Trump Media and GameStop, have also announced plans to acquire Bitcoin. More companies are likely to continue buying Bitcoin as it gradually evolves into a safe-haven asset. It has outperformed stocks and other risk assets since Trump delivered his Liberation Day tariff speech. 3. Federal Reserve and Donald Trump pivot Bitcoin is also expected to receive a boost from Donald Trump and the Federal Reserve, particularly following this week’s economic data . A report released on Tuesday showed that consumer confidence tumbled in April. Another report revealed that the private sector created just 61,000 jobs in April, well below the median estimate of 121,000. The US economy also contracted for the first time since 2022, raising concerns about a possible recession. These numbers suggest that both Trump and the Fed may pivot this month. Trump could begin negotiating trade deals with countries, including China. Meanwhile, the Fed may signal that it is ready to intervene by cutting interest rates. These two actions will end the top risks facing the market this year, and push risky assets like Bitcoin higher.

Combining improvements to the execution and consensus layers, the upgrade builds on previous milestones, such as Shanghai and Dencun, according to Nansen analysis. Pectra doubles the blob data capacity per block from three to six, with a maximum of nine, allowing Layer-2 rollups to post more transaction data at lower costs. At the same time, the gas cost for traditional calldata will increase, nudging developers toward blob usage to support Ethereum’s ( ETH ) long-term scalability path.

EIP-7251 raises the maximum stake per validator from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH, allowing larger stakers to consolidate. Deposits and exits are now fully handled on-chain, cutting activation time from 12 hours to just 13 minutes, and simplifying withdrawals via regular transactions. From a usability standpoint, EIP-7702 introduces temporary smart contract functionality to externally owned accounts. This enables users to bundle actions, use custom signatures, or sponsor gas fees without converting wallets into smart contracts. Additional upgrades include lower-cost BLS cryptography support, extended block history for light clients, and the first phase of the EVM Object Format for cleaner smart contract coding. While not a radical overhaul, Pectra is expected to improve Layer-2 network performance, ease DeFi onboarding, and support more seamless interactions across dApps. Adoption will depend on wallet providers and developers, but the infrastructure changes are already in place.

Although the token gained 2.5% compared to March, it’s currently seeing a slight decline. So, what could May bring for Dogecoin ( DOGE )? Will the trend shift again, or is a slowdown likely to continue? Here’s what we know in our Dogecoin price prediction for May 2025. Table of Contents What is DOGE? DOGE price factors for May Dogecoin crypto price prediction: general outlook Dogecoin price prediction: May 2025 What is DOGE? Dogecoin was launched in 2013, originally inspired by the viral Shiba Inu meme, but it quickly gained traction as a serious cryptocurrency. Over the years, it has built a dedicated global community and attracted attention from major public figures like Elon Musk. You might also like: Elon Musk’s child proposal to Tiffany Fong — and the events leading up to it Technically, Dogecoin runs on a Litecoin-based codebase and uses the Scrypt algorithm, enabling faster and cheaper transactions than Bitcoin. One key characteristic is its unlimited supply — new coins can be mined without a cap, which makes it an inflationary digital asset rather than a deflationary one. What factors could shape Dogecoin price prediction for May 2025? Is Dogecoin a good investment? DOGE price factors for May Nasdaq has officially taken a big step toward making DOGE more accessible by applying to the U.S. SEC for the first-ever 21Shares Spot Dogecoin ETF in April 2025. If it gets approved, investors would be able to invest in Dogecoin without the need for crypto wallets. Such approval could significantly influence Dogecoin’s price by introducing new demand from both institutional and retail investors who previously stayed away from crypto due to complexity or regulatory concerns. The added credibility and accessibility from a regulated ETF could drive up investor confidence, increase liquidity, and potentially lead to upward price momentum — particularly if launched during a favorable market cycle or crypto bull run. Dogecoin crypto price prediction: general outlook As of April 30, 2025, DOGE is trading at $0.17, down about 5% in the past day and week. DOGE 1-day chart, April 2025 | Source: crypto.news In May 2025, we could see Dogecoin’s price move up and down, depending on a few important happenings in the market. One of the biggest factors is the ongoing talk around the 21Shares Dogecoin ETF. If the SEC gives the green light for the ETF, it could spark more interest from institutional investors and possibly lead to a significant price increase. Additionally, Dogecoin’s price may be affected by overall market conditions and broader cryptocurrency trends. Any news regarding regulatory changes, network upgrades, or major partnerships could further impact its price. On the flip side, market corrections or delays in ETF approval could exert downward pressure, resulting in short-term price declines. What are the analytical platforms forecasting in their Dogecoin price prediction for May 2025? Will Dogecoin go up or down? Dogecoin price prediction: May 2025 CoinCodex’s Dogecoin coin price prediction suggests that DOGE could see a small drop next month, with the potential to lose 2.45% and remain at approximately the same price level of $0.17 by May 29. The DOGE price prediction for April 30 leans bearish, as 18 indicators signal a decline, while 11 suggest a possible rebound. You might also like: DOGE price eyes 500% surge based on historical pattern – another cause for celebration after DogeDay According to DigitalCoinPrice’s Dogecoin price forecast, DOGE might increase by nearly 78% in May, potentially reaching a maximum price of $0.36.

Only if you’re okay with some volatility. There’s a lot of excitement around its community and the possible ETF, but expectations for May 2025 are mixed, so it’s worth being cautious. What happens with DOGE next month will depend on market events and time. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/banking-giant-morgan-stanley-prepares-to-launch-cryptocurrency-trading-for-individual-users-here-are-the-details/,"Morgan Stanley is reportedly preparing to launch cryptocurrency trading for individual users via its E*Trade platform, signaling a major shift in how traditional financial giants interact with digital assets. Morgan Stanley Plans to Launch Crypto Trading on E*Trade According to a report by Bloomberg, the initiative is in the early planning stages and could go live as soon as next year. The move would mark one of the most aggressive forays into retail crypto trading by a top U.S. bank and potentially put Morgan Stanley in direct competition with crypto-native exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken. Morgan Stanley is said to be considering partnerships with existing crypto firms to create the infrastructure needed for spot crypto trading. Currently, the bank primarily offers crypto-related ETFs, options, and futures to high-net-worth clients. But its E*Trade initiative will expand access to everyday investors. Domestic momentum has accelerated since Donald Trump took office, triggering a wave of regulatory pushback in the crypto space, sources told Bloomberg, emboldening traditional financial firms to reengage with the digital asset market more openly. If implemented, E*Trade’s launch would reflect a broader institutional pivot toward crypto amid loosening U.S. regulations. Charles Schwab is also reportedly exploring ways to offer spot crypto trading, while SoFi is planning a deeper push into the sector after observing what it calls a “fundamental shift” in the U.S. crypto landscape. Morgan Stanley acquired E*Trade for $13 billion in 2020, positioning it to expand into emerging asset classes like crypto by leveraging the retail trading platform’s user base. The planned offering could significantly reshape the competitive landscape by opening millions of retail accounts to digital assets. *This is not investment advice.

The market is buzzing with speculation about what May holds for these two popular cryptocurrencies. In this article, discover the factors driving their potential rise and explore expert price predictions for DOGE and PEPE. Find out which coins are poised for a breakout this month. DOGE Advances Steadily Amid Key Support and Resistance Zones Dogecoin posted a 5.4% rise in the past month and a steady 10.4% gain over the last six months. A slight weekly drop of 1.35% hints at a short-term pullback within a broader upward move. Price gains have been modest and have helped the coin consolidate while gradually building strength over time. The movement reflects measured advances rather than extreme volatility, with the coin showing controlled progress despite temporary setbacks. Current trading lies between approximately $0.14 and $0.20 with immediate resistance around $0.23 and support near $0.10. There is no clear dominant trend as buyers and sellers seem to be contesting control. A potential trading idea would be to look for entries near support levels and exits near resistance, keeping positions cautious amid mixed signals. Pepe Records Short-Term Surge While Staying Sideways Long-Term Pepe recorded a 23.78% increase over the past month with only a 0.52% gain in the past six months. Price activity maintained a steady pace, with a modest weekly rise of 0.88% indicating short-term upward movement amid a generally sideways trend. Historical performance reflects a sudden burst of buying interest that did not extend over the longer term, suggesting isolated momentum over a period of time. Current trading sees Pepe moving within a range of $0.00000647 to $0.00001057. Key levels include nearby resistance at $0.00001223 and clear support at $0.00000404. The 62.82 RSI and recent monthly rally hint at bullish pressure, though the overall trend remains ambiguous. Trading within these levels while watching for a break toward the second resistance at $0.00001633 may offer strategic opportunities. Conclusion DOGE and PEPE are attracting attention with their recent performance. Both coins are showing signs of potential growth. Analysts are watching closely as traders are optimistic. Current trends suggest increased interest could push prices higher. Staying informed on market movements will be crucial for both short-term and long-term strategies.

The fund brings the firm’s total assets under management to $550 million. Founded in 2022 by Tekin Salimi, a former partner at Polychain Capital, dao5 made early bets on projects including Story Protocol, Bittensor, Berachain and EigenLayer . The firm’s first fund, launched during the final days of the last bull market three years ago, was fully deployed and has already returned “the vast majority of commitments to its limited partners,” according to a press release shared with CoinDesk. “Crypto is entering its adolescence phase. The industry’s dependency on pure speculation as the driver of growth is no longer as effective as it once was,” Salimi said. Future success will be a product of “the real integration of blockchain technology into global financial, governmental, and private sector systems,” he said. The new fund’s focus is on-chain public infrastructure, novel stablecoin systems and “state-sovereign artificial intelligence.” In tandem with the fundraise, the firm plans for its dao5 fund to convert into a decentralized autonomous organization later this year.

Whale accumulation and the possible launch of a spot DOGE ETF approval in the US are two key bullish factors that could support long-term upside, though the impact of recent purchases remains insignificant. What Does the Future Hold? The largest meme coin in terms of market capitalization saw its price rally by almost 15% in the past two weeks. It pumped to as high as $0.19 on April 26 before retracing to the current $0.18 (per CoinGecko’s data). DOGE Price, Source: CoinGecko Numerous market observers have noted the positive performance lately, predicting a surge that has yet to stun the community. The X user Trader Tardigrade claimed DOGE has completed a price breakout when crossing $0.175, envisioning a rise above $0.20 in the following days. CryptoBullet was also optimistic. The analyst believes the OG meme coin “prints a textbook accumulation cylinder,” and according to this pattern, we might witness a “giant pump” in the next few months. They forecasted a possible cycle top of over $3.20 by the end of the year and then a subsequent drop to the current levels by 2027. Crypto Patel seems to be among the biggest bulls. The technical analyst argued that DOGE has bounced from the long-term support zone of $0.169 and could now be poised for a massive rally to as high as $32. Of course, such a price explosion seems highly unrealistic at this stage, as it would require Dogecoin’s market capitalization to exceed $4 trillion. For comparison, the entire crypto sector is currently valued at just above $3 trillion. The Bullish Factors One element that could positively impact the valuation of the meme coin is the whales’ activity. X user Ali Martinez revealed that large investors (those holding between one million and ten million DOGE) have accumulated 100 million tokens over the past week. The whales now own more than 10.5 billion DOGE, representing roughly 7% of the circulating supply of the asset . Such accumulations are usually monitored by smaller players and could encourage them to hop on the bandwagon, too. Purchasing DOGE tokens also reduces the asset’s supply on the open market, which , combined with non-declining demand , could trigger price spikes . However, in this particular case the scooped up amount (worth less than $20 million) seems insignificant to propel that type of scenario. Another factor worth exploring is the possible approval of a spot DOGE ETF in the United States. The investment vehicle would provide investors with an easy and regulated way to gain exposure to the meme coin. Much like buying traditional stocks, the spot ETF would be available through authorized brokerage accounts. Investors would hold shares of the fund, while the fund itself would purchase and securely store the actual cryptocurrency to support those holdings. The companies racing to launch such a product in the USA include 21Shares, Bitwise, and others. Earlier this month, 21Shares filed with the SEC for approval, naming Coinbase Custody as the custodian of the fund. Just a few days ago, Nasdaq submitted a form with the regulator , proposing the listing and trading of shares of the 21Shares Dogecoin ETF on its exchange. Following that development, the approval chances before the end of 2025 climbed to 75% (according to Polymarket).

After teasing to break its all-time high earlier this year, XRP rejected just below the $3.5 level and is currently trading comfortably over $2. Will it reclaim $3 next or $1 is its next stop? Let’s find out in this Ripple price prediction for May 2025. Table of Contents What is XRP? XRP short-term price prediction Ripple coin price prediction: short-term outlook XRP price factors for May 2025 Currently ranked at the 4th position with a market cap of $130.35 billion, XRP ( XRP ) has enjoyed a decent bull run so far with prices touching almost $3.5, in January 2025. Since then the token has seen a 52% drop in prices and is currently trading at $2.2290, and currently trading in a sideways pattern. XRP 1d chart | Source: crypto.news In this article, we’ll discuss the XRP crypto price prediction by giving you its short and price forecasts, and specifically focus on Ripple price prediction for May 2025. What is XRP? The cryptocurrency XRP is a native token of the open-source blockchain XRP Ledger. The purpose of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology is to facilitate international money transactions and currency exchange. Additionally, investors use it to profit from market changes and store value. On its payment platform, blockchain services provider Ripple also uses XRP and the XRP Ledger to let enterprises, organizations, and financial institutions conduct transactions. The holders of XRP maintain that the token has a lot of upside in the coming years, and due to its large fanbase it is ranked among the top 5 cryptocurrencies in the world.

Ripple coin price prediction: short-term outlook According to CoinCodex’s XRP price prediction for the near future, the token is predicted to drop by -17.40% and reach $1.8513 by May 29, 2025.

Feels like they have too much control… #Bitcoin #XRPArmy pic.twitter.com/eeRM2MnQoh — CUTN Crypto (@CUTNCrypto) April 29, 2025 XRP price factors for May 2025 A combination of cautious market mood and regulatory delays is influencing XRP’s pricing in May 2025. The original May 3rd deadline for the U.S. SEC’s judgment on Franklin Templeton’s planned spot XRP ETF has been extended to June 17. The proposal was submitted through the Cboe BZX Exchange in March, and the regulator stated that additional time was needed to review it. As market expectations rise for CME Group’s scheduled May 19 debut of XRP futures , this delay has increased confusion. With a 22% decrease in trading volume over the last day and an RSI of 30, which indicates bearish momentum, XRP is currently trading flat at $2.2290 despite these developments. In the meantime, Bitcoin is trading above $95K after regaining its positive momentum following a decline to $78K. This surge in Bitcoin ( BTC ) has pushed the altcoin market and is further expected to push it if BTC sustains its pump in the coming weeks. XRP traders seem to be waiting for regulatory certainty before making significant changes, despite the fact that overall market sentiment has improved.

Before investing in any cryptocurrency including XRP, please identify and understand the inherent risks that can come due to market volatility. Also, it should be noted that the sentiment in the cryptocurrency market changes quickly, and a price point that was once considered a very strong support or resistance may become invalid in a very short time. Hence it is advisable to do your research on the price action before having any price expectations for the future of the XRP token. Will Ripple go up or down? Cryptocurrencies in general experience rapid price swings that are directly driven by market sentiments, community engagement, events like token burns, and so on. While it is hard to determine how high the XRP token will go, it is important to look out for potential buying factors that may include new partnerships, increased token holders, or viral campaigns in general. It is also vital that you rely on financial experts and consult them for XRP price prediction, but even after all that, you should remain cautious as no one can accurately predict how high or low XRP can go. Should I invest in Ripple? Before investing in any cryptocurrency or trusting any Ripple price forecast, please identify and understand the inherent risks that can come due to market volatility. Also, it should be noted that cryptocurrencies in general are a highly speculative investment and their success not only relies on market volatility but also on the constant and sustainable growth of its community. Hence it is advisable to do your research on the token’s fundamentals which may very well decide the future of the XRP token. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

XRP, Arbitrum, Solana, and Sei Are Serious Players",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/whats-the-2025-crypto-breakout-xrp-arbitrum-solana-and-sei-are-serious-players/,"With 2025 well underway, crypto investors are searching for breakout narratives that could redefine their portfolios before summer. While Bitcoin and Ethereum remain cornerstones, it’s the altcoins like XRP , Arbitrum (ARB) , Solana (SOL) , and Sei (SEI) that are gaining serious momentum. Each of these projects is showing strong technicals, network upgrades, or ecosystem growth that puts them firmly in breakout territory. But one name catching insiders off guard— MAGACOINFINANCE —is quietly emerging as the dark horse for early-stage exposure. After an impressive 2025 rebound, XRP is consolidating above $2.20 and eyeing a breakout if resistance near $2.45 clears. Technical analysis shows bullish divergence on daily charts, and traders are watching for a move toward $5 if ETF speculation materializes. Ripple’s global payments infrastructure, recent positive momentum in the SEC case, and renewed institutional demand have made XRP a leader in this cycle’s altcoin rally. Arbitrum continues to lead Ethereum’s scaling race, boasting over $3 billion in TVL and supporting dozens of top dApps. While technicals suggest an ascending triangle with targets near $1.60–$1.80. With Coinbase’s BASE launching on similar infrastructure, ARB’s tech advantage and liquidity depth make it a serious Layer-2 contender for 2025. ACT NOW — BIGGEST EVENT OF THE DECADE! Solana has maintained strong support above $140 and is now testing resistance near $150. If cleared, analysts project a push toward $200–$250. Its blistering speed and cost-effectiveness have driven growth in stablecoin transfers, gaming, and NFTs. SEI is attracting early attention. Analysts point to its ability to front-run trades and offer low latency—making it ideal for decentralized order book systems. Price action is currently bullish, with the next key level at $0.26 if momentum continues. Why Investors Are Turning to MAGACOINFINANCE Before Listings Among the flurry of altcoin headlines, MAGACOINFINANCE is steadily emerging from the shadows with strong grassroots momentum. It’s not yet listed—but it’s making noise. This isn’t a copycat token riding meme hype. It’s a politically bold, culturally resonant project that’s mobilizing a real online movement. 50% More Tokens for Early Buyers MAGACOINFINANCE is offering early buyers a limited-time 50% bonus on all purchases. Just apply promo code MAGA50X at checkout to increase your allocation. This offer is only valid during the current pre-launch period—and once listings begin, this multiplier disappears for good. Final Thoughts XRP , Arbitrum , Solana , and Sei are all serious players heading into the heart of 2025. Whether it’s scaling speed, financial infrastructure, or ecosystem depth, these projects are in position to outperform. But for those looking beyond the charts and into early-stage narrative-driven altcoins, MAGACOINFINANCE stands out as the breakout that hasn’t fully broken yet. Keep your eyes on it—before the rest of the market does.

The dismissal makes Waltz the first senior official to get kicked out of the White House in Trump’s second term. The chaos started when Waltz added journalist Jeffrey Goldberg to a private Signal group where classified military operations were being discussed by top-ranking officials, including Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The information was exposed by The Atlantic , which confirmed Goldberg had received real-time details about a US airstrike in Yemen. He reportedly saw exact target coordinates, weapons packages, and timing just two hours before the bombs hit. Goldberg never hacked anything. He was added by Waltz himself, who later admitted, “I take full responsibility. I built the group,” during an interview with Fox News. The Signal group wasn’t official government communication. It was personal phones, off-grid, and used to talk about highly sensitive strikes like it was just another Tuesday. Trump held off firing but eventually pulled the trigger Though the exposure instantly embarrassed the administration, Trump didn’t fire Waltz on the spot. Instead, he told reporters he would “look into” it, while venting his frustration privately. CBS News and The Guardian both reported that Waltz had intended to add Brian Hughes, a national security spokesman, but instead dropped Goldberg into the chat. The phone contact had been mislabeled, and by the time anyone noticed, the journalist already had eyes on classified data. Waltz had joined the administration fresh from Congress, where he’d represented Florida’s 6th District until resigning in January. While in the House, he served on the Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, and Armed Services committees. He also came with 27 years in the Army and National Guard, retiring as a colonel. None of that background saved him once Goldberg saw the war plans before the strike even began. Democrats responded immediately. Representative Julie Johnson said, “One less person who will put our troops in harm’s way and risk our national security.” Representative Herb Conway posted, “Good start.” Representative Eugene Vindman wrote that we’re “halfway there,” and called for Pete Hegseth to get removed too.

44030247,https://timestabloid.com/?p=65739,1746113744,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Report: Secret XRP Ledger Where Banks Exchange XRP At Over $1,000",https://timestabloid.com/report-secret-xrp-ledger-where-banks-exchange-xrp-at-over-1000/,"A fresh wave of discourse has swept through the XRP community, stirred by prominent analyst and commentator All Things XRP. In a recent exposé, the analyst reignited conversations surrounding the existence of what some have labeled a “secret ledger” tied to the XRP ecosystem—an elusive infrastructure allegedly used by banks to quietly transfer massive sums behind the scenes. For years, this topic has sat on the fringe of XRP discourse, often written off as rumor or conspiracy. But according to All Things XRP, there’s far more substance to the claim than many believe. He asserts that this ledger is no myth. It’s a real, purpose-built solution Ripple introduced years ago—complete with formal documentation and public acknowledgment. WILD CLAIM: There's a secret version of the XRP Ledger… Where banks move billions—and you can’t even peek inside. Conspiracy? Not anymore. Let’s uncover the truth. pic.twitter.com/NQQh80rWCz — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) April 30, 2025 Inside Ripple’s Purpose-Built Infrastructure for Governments At the core of this debate lies Ripple’s CBDC Private Ledger, a specialized blockchain that was formally introduced in 2021. Unlike the open, permissionless XRP Ledger that powers retail XRP transactions, this private version was engineered specifically to meet the privacy and regulatory demands of central banks and sovereign institutions. This closed system is not integrated with the public XRP Ledger, nor does it utilize XRP as a settlement asset. Instead, it enables institutions to issue and manage central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) at scale, with full transactional confidentiality and compliance baked in. Ripple has detailed this architecture on its official blog and website, describing how the CBDC Private Ledger retains the performance and consensus efficiency of the public XRP Ledger while maintaining full isolation to serve its specialized audience. Debunking the $1,000 XRP Myth In corners of the XRP community, theories have circulated suggesting that XRP is being exchanged at exorbitant prices—sometimes quoted at $1,000 or more—on hidden or restricted networks. A now-infamous theory from a former fund manager in London claimed that such a price discrepancy is evidence of XRP’s true, suppressed value. He speculated that one day, the “public” and “private” ledgers would merge, unleashing a sudden price revaluation. However, All Things XRP directly challenged this idea by pointing to clear statements from Ripple CTO David Schwartz. Schwartz has unequivocally stated that no parallel pricing system exists for XRP. There is no version of the private ledger that involves buying or selling XRP at elevated values. The CBDC ledger does not involve XRP at all. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The analyst emphasized that while the notion of a shadow XRP market may seem alluring, it simply doesn’t hold up under scrutiny. If XRP were truly trading at significantly higher prices in a closed system, institutions would have no reason to ignore the public markets, where they could obtain it at a fraction of the cost. Reality Check: No Secret Markets, Just Enterprise Adoption While the disproof of a clandestine XRP price may dampen some of the more extreme theories, All Things XRP argued that the reality is no less impressive. The CBDC Private Ledger reflects Ripple’s strategic pivot toward sovereign and institutional utility, serving central banks as they explore tokenized national currencies. This architecture supports Ripple’s broader mission to provide scalable, enterprise-grade financial infrastructure. By offering tailored, private ledgers for regulated entities, Ripple is carving out a critical role in the evolving world of CBDCs without relying on public speculation or price-driven hype. Why the Private Ledger Still Matters All Things XRP concluded that the CBDC ledger is a crucial part of Ripple’s long-term vision, even if it doesn’t deliver the sensationalist outcomes some investors imagine. Rather than driving up XRP’s retail price through secretive channels, the private ledger underscores Ripple’s capacity to build infrastructure that meets the needs of real-world institutions. As central banks race to modernize their financial systems, Ripple’s dual-layer approach—public for open asset transfers, private for sovereign solutions—positions it uniquely in the fintech arena. It may not involve $1,000 XRP tokens in a hidden vault, but it does represent one of the clearest signals yet that Ripple’s technology is gaining traction where it matters most: in the foundations of global finance.

The move came after days of tight price action between $93,000 and $96,000, with total market capitalization reaching $1.90 trillion and 24-hour trading volume hitting $29.88 billion, according to recent crypto.news data. The rally builds on momentum that began in mid-April, when Bitcoin ( BTC ) decisively broke out of a long-standing consolidation phase near $74,400. Technical indicators suggest continued upward pressure, with major support now established in the $88,000–$90,000 zone. A dip toward $92,000 could offer a new entry point for long positions if supported by renewed volume, while a fall below $88,000 may signal broader correction risks. Read more: https://crypto.news/why-is-bitcoin-price-stuck-in-a-tight-range/ Is Bitcoin gaining momentum? This rise is nearly 30% from its April low, as investors embraced riskier assets. The rally gained momentum after the cryptocurrency avoided a death cross pattern in April, with bullish technical signals such as a double-bottom and bullish flag breakout suggesting further upside. Institutional interest also grew, with spot Bitcoin ETFs recording $2.9 billion in inflows last month and companies like Tether, SoftBank , and Trump Media adding Bitcoin to their treasuries. At the same time, disappointing U.S. economic data, including weak job growth and declining consumer confidence, fueled expectations of a rate cut by the Federal Reserve. These developments, along with the possibility of a trade policy pivot from Donald Trump, helped drive renewed optimism in Bitcoin’s path forward.

With major partnerships, integrations, and bullish regulatory developments, certain projects are standing out from the crowd. If you’re looking for altcoins to stack right now, here are three tokens that deserve a spot on your radar, according to Altcoin Buzz. Altcoin 1: XRP XRP (Ripple) is causing a stir after it tried to buy Circle, the company behind the USDC stablecoin, for $5 billion. However, Circle turned down the offer. This move was Ripple’s way of trying to take control of the stablecoin market. Ripple is also allegedly meeting with the new SEC chairman, Paul Atkins, which could help solve past legal issues and lead to better times for XRP. The price of XRP is showing signs it might go up soon. Altcoin 2: SUI Sui (SUI) is growing fast by adding Stacks and sBTC to its platform. This allows Bitcoin holders to use their Bitcoin in new ways on Sui. Recently, Sui has become more valuable than big projects like Avalanche and Chainlink. The team is also preparing for the Sui Base Camp event in Dubai, where they will reveal new projects and partnerships. The co-founder of Sui believes the network could become a multi-trillion-dollar project over the next 8 to 12 years as the crypto world continues to expand. Altcoin 3: HBAR Hedera (HBAR) has some exciting news. There’s an 80% chance that an HBAR ETF will be approved soon. If it happens, it could raise the price of HBAR. Hedera is also working with the Nairobi Stock Exchange to create a digital platform that will turn real-world assets, like real estate and stocks, into digital tokens. Hedera is known for being one of the fastest and cheapest blockchains, which makes it a top choice for tokenizing assets.

Robinhood reported first quarter results after Wednesday’s closing bell. Earnings per share of 37 cents was up 106% from last year while revenue of $927 million was up 50% year-over-year. The company saw record net deposits of $18 billion and reached new highs in Robinhood Gold subscribers, which climbed 90% to 3.2 million. The trading platform also continued to roll out new products, including AI-powered financial planning tools and an expanded prediction markets hub.

The stock traded lower by 4% following the report, suggesting the dip represents “a buying opportunity.” Robinhood’s stock recovered from its morning lows of $46.53 and traded at $48.64 at press time, down less than 1%. “They’re getting into Asia, they’re getting into Europe,” the analyst said. “Their product velocity is the best one I’ve ever seen with Robinhood Gold. Pretty much every quarter there is something new and so I think over time what you are going to see is that they are not going to bifurcate from the volatility, but they’re going to fare better than the volatility.” Robinhood deserves credit for its aggressive push into what Dolev describes as a $600 billion total addressable market. The company is seeing strong results, notably from higher net-worth clients that typically flock to legacy platforms like Schwab and Interactive Brokers. “Three years ago everyone thought [Robinhood] was a joke for millennials,” Dolev said. “And now people are taking them really seriously.

With a presale price still under $0.03 and a full DeFi ecosystem already taking shape, Mutuum is positioning itself as one of the best crypto investments before broader recognition sets in. Investors who are serious about catching the next major breakout are paying close attention — and for good reason. With multiple utility layers already in place and momentum growing by the day, it’s unlikely that MUTM will remain this affordable for much longer. Those aiming to find the next big crypto opportunity may want to take a closer look while the project is still in its presale phase. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum’s presale metrics tell a compelling story. Over $7.3 million has already been raised, fueled by the support of more than 9,200 holders, and 431 million tokens have been sold so far. Phase 4 of the presale is already over 52% completed, and once this phase closes, the token price will climb from $0.025 to $0.03. With a launch price firmly set at $0.06, early backers are positioning themselves to potentially double their investment even before MUTM hits public markets. This presale momentum isn’t just about hype; it reflects real confidence from a growing investor base that sees Mutuum as a serious player in the future of decentralized finance. The limited availability and steady buying pressure suggest that MUTM’s days under $0.03 are numbered. Those asking what crypto to invest in today should consider that waiting too long could mean missing out on one of the market’s best early-entry points. Real Utility Behind the Growth Mutuum Finance isn’t simply a token on the rise — it’s an entire decentralized ecosystem built for long-term relevance. The platform introduces a dual lending structure that blends peer-to-contract (P2C) pools for highly liquid assets and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending for more volatile tokens. This creates diversified liquidity strategies that appeal to a wide range of DeFi users, from conservative lenders to adventurous borrowers. Mutuum’s utility framework centers around mtTokens — ERC-20 tokens that reflect users’ deposits and steadily grow in value as interest accumulates. Holders of mtTokens can use them flexibly: as collateral for additional borrowing, for trading on secondary markets, or simply holding to passively accumulate yield. This simple yet powerful system empowers users to maximize returns without complicated reinvestment strategies. Mutuum has also introduced its own overcollateralized stablecoin directly within the platform’s ecosystem. Unlike typical stablecoins that rely on external reserves or third-party liquidity, Mutuum’s stablecoin is minted directly through user collateral. It is burned upon loan repayment, keeping the supply and demand equilibrium tightly balanced. For those seeking crypto investment opportunities with real-world applications, this system offers another compelling reason to engage with the platform early. Mutuum’s ability to create new borrowing and earning opportunities in a safe, decentralized environment strengthens its appeal to DeFi users who are becoming increasingly selective after several years of rapid market evolution. For potential investors, the real-world math looks very appealing. An investment of just $1,000 at the current price of $0.025 would allow you to acquire 40,000 MUTM tokens. Once the project completes its presale and officially launches at $0.06, that initial $1,000 investment will be worth $2,400 based purely on listing price — and that’s before any potential post-launch appreciation. Given the project’s fundamentals, strong user interest, and utility-driven growth, many see Mutuum Finance as a crypto prediction worth betting on. It represents exactly the kind of asymmetrical upside opportunity that made early DeFi investing so profitable in previous cycles. Mutuum Finance is showing all the classic signs of a project about to enter its next growth phase. Presale demand remains strong, token utility is genuinely innovative, and the platform’s foundation is built on sustainable, revenue-generating activity — not empty promises.

However, the bearish pressure over the markets was somewhat negligible, but the WLD bulls have managed to keep up the momentum of the rally. The technicians have been displaying strong directional movement, which favors a decent rise in the price. After the key development, here’s what’s next for the WLD price rally. The platform has entered the U.S. market, which has marked a major milestone for the crypto industry. It has launched the World ID, or Orb in six U.S. States: Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, and San Francisco. The Sam-Altman-led project aims at identity verification and offers WLD tokens for users who do so. With this, the demand for the token is expected to increase subsequently, and with the latest rise, the bulls seem to have gained huge control over the rally. The weekly chart of Worldcoin displays that the price has reached the lowest level of the consolidation, attracting the bulls. The buying pressure has grown considerably, which has pushed the price above the conversion line of the Ichimoku cloud. If the price maintains a considerable ascending trend, the conversion & base lines of the Ichimoku could undergo a bullish crossover, validating the start of a fresh bullish trend. On the other hand, the weekly MACD shows a drop in the selling pressure and with a rise in the buying volume, the price may also begin to surge. The US launch was accompanied by Coinbase listing the WLD token, enabling trade for US customers. Therefore, the volume is said to increase notably in the coming days, which could positively impact the WLD price. The next pitstop for the rally is the pivotal resistance zone between $2.2 and $2.4, and a rise above this range could elevate the levels to $4, completing the double bottom pattern. Hence, a breakout from here could trigger a strong upswing towards the double-digit figure.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|WLD,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-01 16:00:10

And right now, the buzz around early-stage projects is hard to ignore. If you’re paying attention to the current cycle, you know that getting into the right crypto coin presale could mean serious upside later. Whether you’re into utility-focused platforms, privacy tools, or AI-powered solutions, there’s a range of fresh opportunities lining up for 2025. Here’s a closer look at six standout crypto coin presales that are generating real attention from both early adopters and long-term thinkers. 1. BlockDAG: Earning Free BDAG Before Mainnet Launch Has Never Been Easier Among the many crypto coin presale campaigns gaining traction, BlockDAG continues to lead the conversation. It’s not just about coin sales here, it’s also about unlocking real earning potential. Through its powerful referral system, BlockDAG gives participants 25% in BDAG from every person they refer, while the referrals themselves receive 5% extra. It’s a setup that’s drawing attention from anyone looking to grow their holdings ahead of the platform’s official launch. Right now, BlockDAG is in presale batch 28, having raised more than $223 million in total. The current price per coin is $0.0262, which already reflects a 2,380% increase from the initial batch pricing. However, for limited time only, BDAG’s price has been reduced to $0.0019, to give new community members a chance to maximise their ROI before launch. Over 19.6 billion coins have been sold, underscoring the project’s growing popularity. With mainnet launch on the horizon and these bonus incentives limited to presale participants, this is a rare window that many believe won’t stay open for long. 2. Unstaked: AI-Powered Agents Automating Web3 Engagement Unstaked is tackling one of Web3’s biggest tasks: community growth. It’s doing this by deploying autonomous AI agents that manage engagement, content distribution, and promotion across decentralized platforms. What gives Unstaked an edge is its use of on-chain Proof of Intelligence, a mechanism that rewards results transparently and fairly. Currently in stage 2 of its presale, Unstaked has already raised over $867,000 in early support. Tokens are priced at $0.006695, and projections place its potential ROI at 2,700% by launch. If AI continues to integrate deeper into the Web3 stack, Unstaked is well-positioned to become a foundational tool for decentralized influence and engagement. 3. Cold Wallet: Secure, Private, and Built for What’s Ahead Cold Wallet is bringing something serious to the table in terms of user privacy. By integrating zero-knowledge proofs directly into a user-friendly wallet interface, it provides institutional-grade security in a way that’s accessible to everyday crypto users. It’s an important step forward for digital sovereignty. Now in its second presale stage, Cold Wallet is offering tokens at a price of $0.00714. Investors are eyeing a projected ROI of 4,900% at launch, making this one of the most promising early-stage plays for those focused on privacy-first solutions. With rising demand for secure self-custody, Cold Wallet is gaining momentum as a standout crypto coin presale in 2025. 4. Web3 ai: Smarter Tools for Crypto Investors Web3 ai is taking aim at crypto inefficiencies by arming users with AI-enhanced tools. From automated trading and smart alerts to fraud detection and portfolio balancing, this platform is designed to make crypto decision-making more accurate and accessible. It’s about putting pro-level tools into everyday hands. Still in its very first presale stage, tokens are available for just $0.0003. With a projected ROI of 1,747% at launch, early buyers are watching this one closely. For traders seeking high-impact, tech-driven solutions, Web3 ai is quickly becoming one of the most exciting crypto coin presales to watch this year. 5. Dragoin: Meme Culture Meets GameFi Utility Dragoin is building a meme-powered universe with real GameFi elements. Drawing inspiration from fantasy themes like Game of Thrones, this Ethereum-based project is building a play-to-earn mini-game where users train and battle dragons within Telegram to earn tokens and climb leaderboards. Dragoin is currently in its first presale stage with tokens priced at just $0.0000292. With a projected ROI of 6,700% at launch, the numbers speak for themselves. But beyond hype, it’s the token-burning mechanics, gamified incentives, and committed community that give Dragoin a shot at long-term relevance in the meme-meets-utility space. 6. Web3Bay: The Go-To Marketplace for Web3 Products Web3Bay is carving out a much-needed space in Web3 by serving as a marketplace for NFTs, crypto domains, and digital services. Designed to be a one-stop shop for buying, selling, and launching decentralized products, it offers creators and users a streamlined way to participate in the Web3 economy. Now in stage 5 of its presale, Web3Bay has raised over $1.72 million to date. Tokens are currently priced at $0.00524, with an expected launch price of $0.1959, setting up a projected ROI of 6,430%. As Web3 adoption grows, Web3Bay could become an essential launchpad for the next wave of digital creators and collectors. Closing Remarks If you’ve been watching the crypto coin presale scene, this year is offering no shortage of promising options. BlockDAG, Unstaked, Cold Wallet, Web3 ai, Dragoin, and Web3Bay each represent a different slice of what’s possible in Web3’s next chapter. BlockDAG especially is making a name for itself by rewarding early involvement with both strong presale performance and free token incentives. With its 2025 mainnet on the way, the opportunity to stack BDAG before launch won’t last forever. And when you combine tech, timing, and traction, that kind of opportunity is exactly what savvy investors look for. Disclosure: This is a sponsored press release.

The cryptocurrency, which had risen 8% from $2.06 to $2.28 last week, has now lost 3.5% from Monday’s opening price and 7% from its weekly high of $2.36. Related Reading: Only XRP? Expert Claims That’s All You Need To Succeed Market Expert Forecasts Potential 30% Fall To $1.55 A cryptocurrency analyst, Block Bull, forecasts that XRP might drop much deeper in the near future. From the analyst’s April 29 X post, XRP could not break the resistance level at the top of a bull flag pattern on the daily charts. This technical failure may push the price to $1.55, which would be “annoying as hell”, according to Block Bull – a 30% fall from the high of the pattern – and 28.6% from current levels. Block Bull informed followers this possible price fall would be brief and could prove to be the perfect entry point for investors. The analyst intimated big money players tend to use such downturns in markets to accumulate holdings at bargain rates. Likely $XRP is going to fall 30% along with $XLM that Ive just posted. bottom of bull flag and fib level will be a great entry $1.55 (annoying as hell) bleeding the average guy and this is why the rich get richer cos theyre the only ones able to afford to HODL pic.twitter.com/pG3h30Swks — 📈BLOCK BULL📈 (@TheBlockBull) April 29, 2025 XRP Not Alone As Bitcoin And Ethereum Also Struggle The decline pressure on XRP is in line with weaker trends in major cryptocurrencies overall. Bitcoin is struggling to remain above the $95,000 threshold while Ethereum has fallen below $1,800. That this is a market-wide correction and not a specific XRP problem is indicated. Competing Analysis Provides More Optimistic Forecast Not everyone who watches the market sees the dismal outlook. Others noted that while declining 6% in two days from $2.28 to $2.14, XRP has been able to remain above important support levels on shorter timeframes. They said that if XRP can hold support at $2.14, the price may bounce back to $2.24 or higher in short order. More positive predictions even indicate that XRP could hit $5 in a month, a new all-time high for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Code Wars: Cardano Claims The Crown From Ethereum In Core Development Liquidation Data Shows Market Imbalance Meanwhile, latest trading statistics by Coinglass indicate a shocking disparity in market positions. Within 24 hours, nearly $14 million of long positions (bets on the price going up) were liquidated, while just $1.48 million worth of short positions were sold. This almost 1000% gap indicates the majority of traders were placing bets on price rises when the market started going into decline. The sudden sell-off of such a large number of long positions had a cascade effect, dropping prices even quicker. Open interest also declined by 4%, indicating traders were closing out as uncertainty mounts. As of the most recent trading figures, XRP stands at $2.20, down 1.14% since the beginning of the day. Investors now have conflicting messages regarding whether to anticipate further declines or perhaps a possible rebound in the coming days.

Injective and Aptos Also Show Bullish Signs,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/can-ethereum-and-xrp-deliver-again-injective-and-aptos-also-show-bullish-signs/,"Investor interest is returning to familiar market leaders as several tokens demonstrate fresh signs of strength. Ethereum (ETH) and XRP are once again in the spotlight, backed by institutional support and promising technical formations. Alongside them, Injective (INJ) and Aptos (APT) are gaining traction with rising volume and increasingly bullish sentiment. Each of these assets is setting up for what could be an impactful run in the current cycle. Ethereum and XRP Set the Tone Ethereum (ETH) is trading close to $1,830 , supported by whale accumulation and growth in AI-driven and infrastructure-linked applications. Technical indicators remain solid, and confidence is growing around projections that point toward a move into the $2,500–$2,700 range. As network activity expands, ETH remains a foundational pick across investor profiles. XRP , meanwhile, holds steady at $2.15 , supported by the launch of futures ETFs and increasing volume across institutional trading platforms. The $2.45 resistance continues to act as a key test—any breakthrough could signal a new phase of growth and renewed market leadership. Injective and Aptos Continue to Build Momentum Injective (INJ) is holding strong around $35 , praised for its deep integration across trading ecosystems and consistent development milestones. While it hasn’t made daily headlines, the fundamentals behind INJ remain intact, and it’s increasingly viewed as one of the more mature infrastructure plays among altcoins. Aptos (APT) has risen to $9.35 , making a notable 18% weekly move. Its appointment as the official digital wallet provider for Expo 2025 Osaka has helped validate the project in broader markets. With increasing visibility and momentum, Aptos is well-positioned for another breakout if the broader trend continues. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST!

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/japan-based-investment-firm-metaplanet-decided-to-expand-to-america-here-are-the-details/,"Japan-based Bitcoin-focused firm Metaplanet is setting up a U.S. subsidiary in Florida as part of its expanded strategy to accumulate Bitcoin, with plans to raise up to $250 million and attract interest from U.S. institutional investors. Metaplanet Launches US Subsidiary in Florida, Aims to Raise $250 Million for Bitcoin Strategy Metaplanet confirmed that it has established a wholly owned subsidiary headquartered in Miami, citing the state’s pro-Bitcoin stance, financial innovation environment, and supportive regulatory climate as key reasons behind the move. “As a rapidly developing hub for Bitcoin-focused companies and financial innovation, Florida is known for its business-friendly policies and rising status as a global capital and technology hub,” the company said. The new US arm aims not only to attract new capital from American investors, but also to expand Metaplanet’s scope into a new time zone, increasing its global footprint and relevance. The move comes amid growing crypto momentum in Florida, where lawmakers and political figures have been actively pushing for deeper integration of Bitcoin into state-level fiscal policy. In April, the Florida House Insurance and Banking Committee passed legislation that would allow the state treasury to invest in Bitcoin. Florida’s crypto-friendly environment is further bolstered by political donations from crypto-backed PACs like Fairshake and figures like CFO Jimmy Patronis, who last year encouraged the Florida Retirement System to consider allocating a portion of its assets to Bitcoin. Recent filings revealed that the Florida Retirement System owns more than 160,000 shares of Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, the largest institutional holder of Bitcoin, indicating increasing institutional alignment with digital asset investment strategies. Metaplanet has rapidly increased its Bitcoin holdings this year. The company holds exactly 5,000 BTC worth approximately $474.7 million as of May 1, an increase of 184% since January 1, when it held just 1,762 BTC. *This is not investment advice.

Metaplanet Plans To Raise $250 Million For Its New Florida Arm The Tokyo-listed investment firm will operate its new entity, Metaplanet Treasury Corp., to tap into U.S. institutional investors and support round-the-clock operations across different time zones. Metaplanet selected Florida due to its increasing reputation as a hub for Bitcoin innovation and corporate adoption: “The reason for choosing Florida is clear: the state is rapidly emerging as a global hub for Bitcoin innovation, corporate adoption, and financial liberalization,” a Wednesday post on X from Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich explained. “With planned capital of up to $250 million, this move will accelerate its Bitcoin treasury strategy and serve as a crucial step in expanding access to liquidity for institutional investors in one of the world’s leading capital markets,” Gerovich continued. The creation of a U.S. arm follows Metaplanet’s appointment of Eric Trump, the son of U.S. President Donald Trump, to its strategic advisory board. Beyond the company’s goal of reaching 10,000 BTC in 2025, it has set a target of 21,000 BTC by the end of 2026. Bitcoin Accumulation Strategy Metaplanet has been actively buying the apex cryptocurrency since it formally adopted the Bitcoin treasury strategy in April 2024, surpassing the 5,000 BTC threshold last week after its latest 145 BTC buy, which is 50% of its year-end target. That was financed by what Metaplanet described as “Asia’s largest-ever” capital raise of $745 million, structured around zero-discount moving strike warrants. Metaplanet’s approach mirrors the Bitcoin playbook pioneered by Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin development company, Strategy. Earlier this week, Strategy announced the acquisition of an additional 15,355 BTC for $1.4 billion, pushing its substantial stack to 553,555 BTC , valued at over $52 billion.

Speaking during a keynote address at Paris Blockchain Week on Wednesday, the pundit walked the audience through the journey from Bitcoin’s first-generation model of decentralized value transfer, to Ethereum ’s introduction of programmable smart contracts, and finally to the third generation’s focus on scalability, governance, and interoperability. However, even with these advancements, Hoskinson argued that the current blockchain landscape remains incomplete. “What we’re missing is privacy, identity, and true cooperation ,” he noted . “If we want to see global adoption, we have to evolve beyond the zero-sum mindset.” Unlike past phases that often positioned themselves as competitors to legacy finance and one another, the fourth generation, according to Hoskinson, will aim to unify systems rather than replace them. This new era aims to eliminate the adversarial dynamics of current token economies, which often pit blockchain networks against each other in a race for dominance. “ Why can’t Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano all coexist and complement each other?” he asked. “The next evolution must be cooperative. It must offer abstraction, allowing users to access privacy and compliance without abandoning their existing ecosystems.” Hoskinson further pointed to privacy as a cornerstone of real-world business adoption. Whether it’s financial institutions, medical providers, or everyday consumers, he stressed that private data must be protected, but also usable in a compliant, auditable way when needed. To that end, he introduced Midnight, a new platform under development by Input Output Global (IOG). Notably, Midnight will feature chain abstraction, allowing users from networks like Bitcoin , XRP, and Solana to access its capabilities using their native tokens. The platform will also support privacy-focused smart contracts using a TypeScript-based language, with upgradeable zero-knowledge proofs at its core. In a surprise announcement, Hoskinson also revealed plans for a broad, non-adversarial token distribution through an airdrop to users across eight major networks, including Bitcoin, Ether, Cardano, XRP, and Solana. “ The future of crypto isn’t DeFi or TradFi,” he concluded. “It’s just ‘Fi’, a seamless, interoperable financial system that serves everyone without compromising on privacy or inclusion.” Interestingly, Hoskinson’s take is resonating across the crypto space, with projects like Shiba Inu leading the way. Notably, the network is enhancing blockchain interoperability through its Layer 2 solution, Shibarium, which now integrates Chainlink ’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). Shiba Inu is also prioritizing privacy and decentralized identity with its Shib Name Service (SNS), allowing users to create readable wallet addresses. This aligns with the Self-Sovereign Identity trend, enhancing security, user experience, and reducing censorship risks.",Cryptocurrency|Featured|News|Cardano|Charles Hoskinson,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|SHIB,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-01 16:09:07

Can It Hit $155 in Short-Term?,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/01/solana-surges-8-despite-global-economic-tensions-defies-correction,"Geopolitical tensions and evolving trade policies continue to shape cryptocurrency markets, with Solana emerging as a focal point amid global economic uncertainty. SOL has shown impressive recovery strength, climbing 8% from its April 30 low of $140 to around $152, with daily trading volume jumping 35% over 24 hours. This resilience comes as US-China trade relations deteriorate, creating ripple effects across traditional and digital asset markets. The move comes as the broader market gauge CoinDesk 20 Index, climbed about 4% on Thursday. Technical Analysis Highlights SOL recovered from a significant 7.4% correction on April 30, dropping from 148.03 to 140.63 before reaching new period highs at 152.69. Overall trading range of 12.04 points (8.3%) showcases volatility, with strong support established at 140.65. Volume analysis reveals heightened trading during the correction (2.4M+ volume) followed by sustained buying interest during recovery. Recent price action forms an ascending channel with resistance at 152.50, while the 148.50-149.50 zone serves as a key support level, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data. Bullish momentum appears sustainable with higher lows forming, suggesting potential continuation toward the 155.00 psychological level. In the last 100 minutes, SOL experienced significant volatility, dropping sharply from 152.38 to a low of 150.74 before staging a V-shaped recovery to 152.49. Key support established at 151.10, where substantial buying volume (44K+) emerged. A mid-session rally from 151.22 to 152.60 coincided with the highest volume spike (126K at 14:00), indicating strong institutional interest. The short-term ascending channel was established with resistance at 152.68 and support at 152.32. The 152.45-152.50 zone now serves as immediate resistance that could determine near-term direction.

The revelation, made at the ongoing Token2049 conference in Dubai by WLFI co-founder Zach Witkoff, marks a major milestone for the fledgling stablecoin, which has surged to a $2.1 billion valuation in record time despite its absence from major centralized crypto exchanges. A Rapid Ascent for USD1 Witkoff framed the partnership as a vote of confidence in USD1’s stability and utility. We thank MGX and Binance for their trust in us,” he said. Eric Trump, also present at the Dubai event, noted that digital assets like USD1 could “disintermediate financial institutions” and reduce the reliance on untrusted governments or currencies. His rhetoric is in keeping with that of his father, U.S. President Donald Trump’s pivot from crypto skeptic to self-styled champion of the industry. While MGX’s deal for a minority stake in Binance was first announced in March, the decision to use USD1 for settlement had been kept under wraps until now. The $2 billion deal was the biggest funding agreement made with a crypto platform and the largest to be paid out in stablecoin. USD1’s rise has been nothing short of meteoric. Within weeks of its launch, its market cap flashed past the $1 billion mark, outpacing the early performances of more established rivals like Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC. With 2,127,970,381 units circulating , the stablecoin now boasts a market cap of over $2.1 billion. Witkoff recently took to X to celebrate the milestone, with BitGo, USD1’s custody and infrastructure provider, calling it “the fastest rise from 0 to $1B in stablecoin history.” The company has played a major role in USD1’s development, using its Stablecoin-as-a-Service platform to support the asset’s rapid scaling. Initially deployed on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain (BSC), the stablecoin is set to expand to the Tron network, whose founder, Justin Sun, invested $75 million in WLFI earlier in the year. Stablecoin Hierarchy Under Threat? The U.S. dollar-pegged coin’s explosive growth comes amid intensifying competition in the stablecoin sector, with some raising eyebrows over its political associations and rapid adoption by institutional players like MGX. Still, its $2 billion valuation is far from USDT’s $149.3 billion, making up more than 61% of the total stablecoin market’s valuation. Previously, it was reported that USDT dominates Tron, boasting a 98.5% share of the network’s stablecoin supply, with the likes of USDD, TUSD, and USDC making up 1.15%, 0.26%, and 0.06%, respectively. However, USD1 is yet to be listed on major centralized exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, and observers expect such listings to expand its liquidity and potentially reshape the stablecoin hierarchy dramatically.

While Bitcoin saw its third-highest week in terms of SEC filings, a milestone that marks continued institutional interest in the leading asset, Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA) , XRP , and Dogecoin (DOGE) also recorded a similar increase in related filings. Data from investment data analytical platform Alphractal displayed a continuous rise in Ethereum (ETH)—-based ETF filings, with a massive jump in filing mentions, crossing 200 in 2024 and further solidifying its position as the top institutional alternative to Bitcoin. With smart contracts as a key point of appeal for market players, investors can be seen throwing their weight behind Cardano (ADA), as the ETF filing mentions crossed 80 in the previous year. Similarly, Dogecoin (DOGE), with more than 20 SEC filing mentions from the previous year, has been cited repeatedly in institutional portfolios — a development signaling that investors are beginning to take the leading and heavily criticized memecoin seriously. Institutional players are bracing up for the next phase of the crypto market While Bitcoin-based ETFs were initially the most demanded products, thanks to the asset’s attractive price value and massive adoption rates, the new development suggests growing trust among institutional investors in alternative coins. The shift indicates a focus on diversification as a key strategy among institutional players entering the market, and further affirms the growth and maturation of the crypto market and various blockchain ecosystems. It’s worth mentioning that SEC filings can be used to measure institutional interest in crypto, and the rise in altcoin-based ETF filings indicates that key players are preparing for the next phase of the market.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cardano|Dogecoin|Ethereum News|XRP News,EN,0,0,ADA|BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-01 17:11:35

Tesla Chair Denies WSJ Report “Earlier today, there was a media report erroneously claiming that the Tesla Board had contacted recruitment firms to initiate a CEO search at the company,” Denholm said . “This is absolutely false (and this was communicated to the media before the report was published).” Earlier today, there was a media report erroneously claiming that the Tesla Board had contacted recruitment firms to initiate a CEO search at the company.

Musk also took to X to deny the Wall Street Journal’s claim, calling the report an “extremely bad breach of ethics” and a “deliberately false article.” Elon Musk Addresses Tesla Scrutiny The SpaceX CEO has faced backlash for serving as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), with several politically motivated attacks against Tesla vehicles, dealerships, and charging stations taking place across the U.S. in recent months. The electric vehicle maker saw a dismal 2025 Q1 report last month, with the organization’s net profits plunging by over 71%. Speaking at a town hall in Wisconsin in March, the longtime crypto investor briefly addressed the criticism of his company. “My Tesla stock, and the stock of everyone who owns Tesla, has roughly halved,” he said at the event hosted by his crypto-friendly America PAC . “I mean, it’s a big deal.” Founded in 1889, the Wall Street Journal is the largest-circulation newspaper in the U.S., often featuring center-right views. Trump and his far-right affiliates have long voiced their distrust of certain media outlets, frequently referring to articles they disagree with as “fake news.” “WSJ is a discredit to journalism,” Musk said in a May 1 X post.

A coalition made up of the Solana Foundation, crypto asset manager Superstate, and DeFi platform Orca has submitted the 18-month pilot proposal to the SEC. Project Open aims to deliver instant trade settlement—something traditional finance has struggled to achieve—ultimately opening the door for a regulatory framework. While Solana’s 60% April-long surge has since plateaued, approval could reignite momentum, strengthening the altcoin’s case in the “best crypto to buy” conversation. Solana Price Analysis: Could Tokenisation Push SOL to $1000? No one has named specific chains, but Solana’s involvement puts it at the heart of the tokenization effort—a niche projected to grow to $19 trillion by 2033. It's pretty obvious that RWA is one of the highest upside sectors in the entire space. RWA tokenization on-chain is expected to reach nearly $19 trillion by 2033. pic.twitter.com/hHdN68REsl — Miles Deutscher (@milesdeutscher) April 21, 2025 This could be the catalyst needed to break above the $160 resistance and advance the breakout of a bullish 4-year cup-and-handle pattern. SOL / USDT 1-week chart, cup-and-handle pattern. Source: TradingView / Binance. A clean move above this level would bring the $190 resistance into focus — a likely retest point aligning with the upper bound of the descending channel forming the handle. This 25% setup is gaining credibility as technical indicators turn bullish. The RSI is climbing toward the neutral 50 line, showing growing buyer strength. Most notably, the MACD is nearing a bullish golden cross — poised to flip above the signal line for the first time since the post-election rally. Historically, this setup signals the early stages of a major trend reversal on higher time frames. If Solana can break above the pattern’s resistance, the rally could extend to $350 — a 200% gain from current levels. And if momentum holds, a run toward $1,000 isn’t off the table. Solana Faces One Major Roadblock – But This New Layer-2 Could Be the Game-Changer Speculators have been quick to rule out Solana as a candidate, questioning its ability to support the high-volume demand of global finance markets with its biggest limitation: scalability. But that narrative could shift with the arrival of Solaxy ($SOLX) , Solana’s first-ever Layer-2 scaling solution. Solana has long lacked this capability, limiting its DeFi and cross-chain use case—until now. By processing transactions off-chain and finalizing them on Solana, Solaxy significantly reduces congestion and lowers transaction costs, while offering seamless interoperability across both blockchains. With over $32.5 million in its ongoing presale , investors are already rallying behind the project. When demand for Solana increases, it could be the one to reap the fresh ecosystem liquidity. You can keep up with Solaxy on X and Telegram , or join the presale on the Solaxy website .

That same Cardano that was trading for just a few cents quietly built momentum and later turned early participants into six-figure holders. If you’re still kicking yourself for not jumping in early, you’re not alone. The crypto scene has seen this story play out a hundred times — and if you’re not learning from it, you’re just setting yourself up for the same cycle of regret. The real question now is: what’s that next low-key coin everyone’s overlooking? This is where Qubetics steps in. While the hype hasn’t reached its peak yet, its presale is already 32 stages deep — and it’s still accessible. That’s rare. Qubetics has fused cutting-edge tokenization technology with practical real-world utility, and that alone makes it the most talked about popular crypto coin to buy in niche crypto communities right now. The FOMO is building, and with its presale clock ticking down, early adopters who ignored it at $0.01 are watching the price climb with each passing week. You’re not too late — but you’re definitely not early anymore. Qubetics Could Be the Popular Crypto Coin To Buy Before the Window Shuts Those who got in on the Qubetics whitelist didn’t even need to pay upfront — they locked in $TICS at just $0.01 during the presale kickoff back on September 29, 2024. Since then, the project has quietly moved through 31 phases, and now it’s sitting at Stage 32 with a price of $0.2093. You’ve missed a big chunk of low-price opportunities, but this best crypto presale hasn’t escaped your reach just yet. Over $16.5 million has already poured in, with more than 510 million tokens sold and 25,500 holders on board. With each stage lasting only seven days and prices jumping 10% between stages, time isn’t on your side. At its current price, a simple $100 investment into Qubetics could grow into $477.80 if $TICS hits $1, or even up to $7,066 if it climbs to $15 post-mainnet — that’s a 7,066.39% return. And here’s the kicker: if the coin hits $10 after launch, which aligns with long-term projections, your $100 would become $4,677.59. With the mainnet set to launch in Q2 2025, momentum is gaining fast. This alone puts Qubetics in the spotlight as the popular crypto coin to buy before serious price action begins. Beyond the hype, the actual utility of Qubetics makes it different from countless altcoins. It’s pioneering a Real World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace — a space where physical and digital assets like real estate, music rights, or equity shares can be tokenized for easier trade. Think of a retired teacher in Chicago turning her home’s value into tradable tokens or a business owner in Lagos tokenizing equipment to fund expansion. Qubetics creates access, liquidity, and investment opportunities in ways that traditional finance just doesn’t allow. This real-world utility, matched with a strategic and fair presale structure, is what makes it the popular crypto coin to buy for those watching the 2025 charts closely. Cardano Was Slept On — Here’s What It’s Done Since Cardano didn’t scream for attention in its early days. In fact, when it launched in 2017, its ICO priced ADA at a fraction of a dollar. Most people ignored it because it lacked the noise and fanfare of Ethereum or Bitcoin. But those who bought early and held tight saw ADA reach an all-time high of $3.10 in 2021 — a wild transformation that turned patient believers into serious winners. That slow-and-steady strategy paid off, proving once again that the coins with real tech foundations often rise when no one’s looking. Since its early years, Cardano has kept developing, pushing smart contract capabilities, and expanding its DeFi footprint. And despite being overlooked at times, it continues to maintain a strong position in the crypto market by staying community-focused and building tech with a long game in mind. The same kind of quiet grind is exactly what Qubetics is replicating — early stages, strong utility, and a strategic rollout that could flip into huge growth once adoption kicks in. Conclusion: Missing Qubetics Now Could Be Your Next Crypto Regret If you missed out on Cardano before it pumped, ask yourself if you’re willing to miss out on something that shows the same early potential. Qubetics isn’t just another coin riding hype waves — it’s offering a presale opportunity with measurable ROI, real-world utility, and transparent project goals. With so many early wins already in the rearview mirror and new investors joining every day, this is your chance to join something still early, still affordable, and still under $0.21. So if you’re looking for the popular crypto coin to buy, stop scrolling. Qubetics is that one shot worth taking — just don’t wait too long to join this best crypto presale before the price breaks past your comfort zone.

However, a closer look at key market trends reveals that demand for the asset still favors many bullish possibilities. In April, MicroStrategy added 15,000 more BTC to its holdings, Bitcoin hit its third-highest week ever in terms of SEC Filings, and the asset crossed over the $90,000 price level, but the long-term rally is yet to kick off. To understand the current state of the market, it is worth noting that while Bitcoin is exiting exchanges and going into cold storage, a large portion is making its way into institutional custody through ETFs, trading infrastructure, and fund administrators, marking an upstream movement in the market. As Bitcoin retests its previous support and continues on an upward trajectory, short-term traders and long-term holders looking to take a profit enter the market, resulting in continuous selling. As a result, significant market buys like MicroStrategy’s $1.4B Bitcoin accumulation are unlikely to trigger major price rallies, as their key purchasing strategies are working hand in hand with an ever-changing market. Digital asset infrastructure producer Swan, convinced that the Bitcoin market is about to take a non-linear path, courtesy of institutional holders, wrote the following: “Miners produce ~13,500 BTC per month. But MicroStrategy—using cheap debt and relentless capital—has outpaced that production for months. They’re not just stacking. They’re compressing Bitcoin’s supply curve from the outside. This is a kind of synthetic halving. Not every four years—But every time institutional capital hits “buy.” At report time, Bitcoin is up 1.80% from the previous day and is now trading at $97,189. With the new month kicking off with leading assets adding weekly gains, the global crypto market cap, valued at $3 trillion, has increased by 1.29% over the last day.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|BTCUSD|BTCUSDC|BTCUSDT|Cryptocurrency News|XBTUSD,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-01 17:19:04

Here’s What Analysts Expect Next for Ripple,https://cryptonews.com/news/should-you-sell-xrp-this-may-heres-what-analysts-expect-next-for-ripple-price-prediction/,"XRP (XRP) is the best-performing cryptocurrency of the top 5 this year with annual gains of 7.5% despite the significant turbulence that the market has gone through. As May begins, the market’s old saying – “ Sell in May and go away ” – could be a cause of concern for the superstitious. However, market experts seem to believe that May could be as bullish as April was for cryptos. In this XRP price prediction , we’ll explore whether the rally has more room to run or if a cooldown is coming. Sell in May? Nah not happening. May 2025 looks more like a setup for upside than a month to bail out. There’s just too much bullish stuff happening On top of the historic supply squeeze I already posted about – and my deep dive into global liquidity and the M2 trends -… — Nic (@nicrypto) April 30, 2025 Nic Puckrin, the head of the crypto-focused online magazine CoinBureau, is just one of the long list of analysts who think that cryptocurrencies could move to higher ground this month. In an X post, he emphasized that Bitcoin (BTC) has performed positively in nine of the past twelve years during this month. He also said that institutional inflows to Bitcoin-spot ETFs and a lower correlation between BTC and stocks also support a bullish outlook for cryptos, including XRP. No Need to Sell in May as Long as XRP Stays Above These Support Levels Looking at the daily chart, the price broke above a descending triangle and immediately jumped above the 21-day EMA during a session that saw strong trading volumes. Recently, the price has moved near its 200-day EMA, meaning that the uptrend that started back in November has weakened as market participants wait for the next positive catalyst that could either make or break XRP. For now, the token’s outlook is still bullish as the 21-day EMA is still above the 200-day EMA while momentum indicators are still in positive territory. However, as XRP continues to consolidate, the $2.6 level remains the most critical resistance to watch as a break above this marker could mean that the token is ready for its next leg up. Meanwhile, its short-term and long-term EMAs remain the key support zones to monitor during what’s historically a bearish month. As long as the price holds above those levels, there’s little reason for panic selling in May. At the same time, as crypto markets gradually recover, emerging opportunities are beginning to outperform legacy assets. In particular, top crypto presales like MIND of Pepe are attracting investor attention thanks to their high upside potential compared to established coins like XRP or Bitcoin. MIND of Pepe (MIND) Raises Nearly $9M to Launch its Powerful AI Agent MIND of Pepe (MIND) leverages the power of AI and the popularity of the Pepe the Frog meme coin to captivate large audiences across social media platforms like X.

Speaking to cryptocurrency analyst Anthony Pompliano, CIA Deputy Director Michael Ellis spoke about Bitcoin. Stating that Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are permanent, Ellis also stated that they are useful for tracking enemies. Noting that Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are beneficial to intelligence, Ellis said that more and more institutions are adopting crypto and that this is a great trend. Stating that their support as the CIA is not a whim but strategic, Ellis argued that Bitcoin is especially useful for payment transactions and can be used in payments. The deputy director of the CIA has highlighted the intersection of national security and cryptocurrency, stating that the US is “enormous in its use of cryptocurrency to monitor and disrupt the activities of its adversaries.” At this point, Ellis stated that he sees Bitcoin as part of the global technological competition and said that the US should stay ahead of China and this can happen with BTC and crypto. Ellis, who was appointed Deputy Director of the CIA in February 2025, served in the NSA, the National Security Council, and as a Navy Reserve Intelligence Officer before joining the CIA. The CIA deputy director’s comments highlight Bitcoin’s growing role beyond investment, while also pointing to its increasing global use across public and private sectors, including the intelligence community. *This is not investment advice.

The stock rallied ahead of the quarterly report, expected after the markets close on May 1. Strategy (MSTR) was among the most actively traded stocks on May 1, ahead of the company’s quarterly results call. MSTR expanded in the past few days but broke above the $400 range for the first time in 2025. MSTR rose by 33.75% in the year to date, trading at $400.72. The shares briefly peaked at $401.10. In April, MSTR had its biggest gain since November 2024, regaining the hype from the previous BTC bull rally. Michael Saylor, executive chairman of Strategy, noted that MSTR has so far outperformed alongside BTC. $MSTR is now up more than 3000% since adopting the Bitcoin Standard. pic.twitter.com/ZqBKMHG999 — Michael Saylor (@saylor) May 1, 2025 The shares saw $2B of volumes traded in 90 minutes soon after the US market opening bell. The shares added 5.52% in the early morning hours, surpassing other tech stocks. The shares extended their momentum from April, when MSTR added over 70% to its price, with no pullbacks for the past three weeks. MSTR rallied in April, tracking the BTC recovery in the second half of the month. | Source: MSTR Google market summary The performance of MSTR surpassed the net gains of BTC for the year to date. The MSTR shares expanded as Strategy kept announcing weekly BTC purchases, but the last day led to an even stronger rally. MSTR outperformed tech stocks, which were pressured by the US trade war talks. The MSTR rally coincided with the ongoing recovery of BTC, up to $97,002.72. The leading coin expects to regain the $100,000 level soon, further boosting the exposure of MSTR. Strategy expanded its reserves to 2.63% of the BTC supply, becoming one of the largest single holders. The recent MSTR rally is also reviving the dilemma of whether owning MSTR is better compared to holding a self-custodied BTC. Can MSTR go through a short squeeze? MSTR is still far from its 12-month peak of $542.99. The recent rally is seen as either a short-term reaction to the earnings report or a potential short squeeze based on data about shorted MSTR shares and bets against Strategy. In the past, MSTR has shown limited signs of a short squeeze, leading to rallies above the $400 level. However, traders warned that MSTR is not likely to repeat the scenario of GameStop and rely on irrational holding. One mechanism with the effect of a short squeeze is the capital allocated to MSTY. The ticker represents an ETF that shorts MSTR. MSTR is setup for a squeeze because billions of dollars of capital are unknowingly short it for ""yield"" (MSTY). — Joe Burnett, MSBA (@IIICapital) May 1, 2025 Additionally, traders shorted derivative tickers MSTU and MSTX, also tied to the performance of MSTR. If MSTR continues the rally, some of those traders may have to close or cover their positions. Some of the short positions have been closed, but other holders may face ongoing losses. Previously, Saylor himself called for attempts at shorting MSTR to show confidence in the direction of the shares and the long-term potential of BTC. The other possible scenario for MSTR is that the rally will stall after the quarterly results come in, dampening the hype. Some of the expectations see MSTR crashing back under $350 after the earnings call. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

Here’s What Happened,https://timestabloid.com/cardanos-leios-shows-off-exceptional-efficiency-heres-what-happened/,"Cardano’s Leios architecture is already making waves within the blockchain community, with new details suggesting that the system’s scalability and efficiency may surpass long-standing industry expectations. In a recent X post, Cardano advocate Mintern shared insights from Input Output Global (IOG) Senior Prototyping Engineer Brian Bush, who revealed that Leios runs smoothly even under peak load on as few as two CPU cores. This revelation underscores a major milestone in Cardano’s pursuit of efficient, decentralized infrastructure. BREAKING NEWS: CARDANO’S LEIOS CAN RUN SMOOTHLY ON JUST 2 CORES IOG Senior Prototyping Engineer Brian Bush says “Cardano’s Leios is so efficient it runs smoothly on just 2–4 cores even at peak load. No need for high-end machine.” @InputOutputHK Is this the final blow to… pic.twitter.com/zit0ebzQl8 — Mintern (@MinswapIntern) May 1, 2025 Leios: Lightweight Performance, Heavyweight Impact At the heart of the announcement is Leios, a cornerstone component of Cardano’s evolution toward Voltaire—the governance era. Leios is part of a larger scaling initiative aimed at decoupling computation from consensus and enhancing throughput without sacrificing decentralization. Brian Bush’s comments confirm what Cardano developers have hinted at for months: the network’s ability to process high transaction volumes using minimal hardware resources is not just theoretical—it’s being proven in real-world conditions. According to Bush, Leios is “so efficient it runs smoothly on just 2–4 cores even at peak load,” eliminating the need for expensive, high-performance computing setups. This presents a sharp contrast to competing blockchain architectures that often require advanced infrastructure to maintain performance under stress. A Scalable Future Without the Hardware Arms Race The implications of this development are profound. Blockchain networks have long faced scrutiny over their scalability and resource requirements. Critics have questioned whether Cardano could ever meet the demands of global adoption without compromising its decentralized ethos or requiring costly machines that price out average users and validators. Leios directly addresses those concerns. By demonstrating that peak performance can be achieved using modest hardware, potentially even from consumer-grade laptops or low-powered servers, Cardano is reinforcing its commitment to accessibility and environmental sustainability. The architecture also aligns with the network’s long-standing philosophy: decentralization should be achievable without specialized, resource-intensive setups. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A Potential Turning Point for Cardano Skeptics For years, Cardano has faced criticism from skeptics who argue that its academic and methodical development approach comes at the expense of real-world performance. But recent advances, including Mithril for light client efficiency and Hydra for off-chain scaling, have shown Cardano’s layered roadmap to be yielding tangible results. With Leios joining this suite of innovations, Cardano is emerging as one of the most scalable, energy-efficient, and hardware-accessible networks in the blockchain space. Brian Bush’s statement might just be the final blow to those who have doubted Cardano’s technical viability. Lightweight Scalability, Heavyweight Potential As Cardano marches steadily toward full Voltaire implementation and greater governance decentralization, innovations like Leios will be pivotal. They not only bolster the network’s efficiency but also lower barriers to entry for participants across the globe. Thanks to Mintern’s spotlight on this critical update, it’s clear that Leios is not just a technical achievement—it’s a symbol of Cardano’s long-term vision becoming reality. Efficient, sustainable, and inclusive infrastructure may soon become the standard for next-generation blockchains, and Cardano looks well-prepared to lead the way.

The company made more than $1 billion in profit from its traditional investments during the first quarter. However, that’s a big drop compared to the $6 billion profit it reported in the previous quarter. Tether’s U.S. Treasury Holdings Approach $120 Billion Tether has released its Q1 2025 report, showing solid financial results despite a rocky quarter for the crypto market. In a press release today, the stablecoin company announced it made over $1 billion in operating profit during the first quarter. Its investments in U.S. Treasurys also reached nearly $120 billion, the highest in its history. These numbers, confirmed by global accounting firm BDO, shows Tether’s increased dominance. Tether’s USDT remains the world’s largest U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, with around $150 billion in circulation. The company regularly releases quarterly reports showing the reserves backing USDT. Also read: Tether Targets U.S. Stablecoin Launch, Awaits Regulatory Clarity Tether said its nearly $120 billion in U.S. Treasury exposure includes both direct investments and indirect holdings through money market funds and reverse repurchase agreements. Direct investments in Treasurys made up about $99 billion at the end of Q1. Tether made over $1 billion in profit in Q1 2025, down from $6 billion in the previous quarter. The earlier jump was mostly due to gains from Bitcoin and gold.

During its current phase 4 presale period Mutuum Finance (MUTM) draws investors with $7.3 million in funding at the $0.025 token price. Users have purchased over 425 million SOL tokens during this phase as 9,200 people held SOL for evidence of strong market demand. The DeFi project MUTM shows exceptional potential for a 35x post-launch growth because of its lending model and buy pressure factors which will outperform SOL and SHIB’s projected 3x-5x rises. Investors have joined MUTM presale because they recognize the market offers a hard-to-find investment chance. Solana’s Steady Climb Solana (SOL) follows a trajectory to achieve $2,000 because of expanding international usage while maintaining low scalability constraints. The cryptocurrency has managed to surpass $130 while delivering 6.4% weekly gains and increasing its trading volume by 56% to reach $3.4 billion. Experts predict the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will authorize SOL Exchange-Traded Funds in 2025 which might push its value to as high as $4,000. The expansion rate of SOL appears slower than other emerging projects in the market. At this point in time the established position of this cryptocurrency restricts quick-adjustments in price which means forecasts remain within 3x-5x of current values. Shiba Inu’s Whale Surge The surge of whale transactions for Shiba Inu (SHIB) has reached a 95% increase as whales move $7.75 million worth of tokens. Past price rallies during November 2024 increased 100% so upcoming market movements might potentially raise prices once again. The latest SHIB price rally has reached a critical point near $0.0000129 whereas reduced retail interest becomes apparent through the 30% decrease in address activity. Aggressive trading at exchanges creates positive signals but SHIB’s speculative nature limits its potential growth to between three and five times. Market volatility drives investors towards projects offering structured growth because stability along with utility become their primary concerns. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Powerhouse Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to grab investor interest during the fourth stage of its presale where it sells for $0.025. Current MUTM token investors will enjoy a 20% profit increase once phase 5 starts at $0.03 since the selling pace during phase 4 is accelerating rapidly. Analysts predict the tokenomics for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to return an ultimate ROI of 9,900% when the token lists at $0.06 while forecasts show a $2.50 post-launch target price produces a 140% gain. The decentralized borrowing and passive income features available through MUTM’s lending platform attract many users because of the platform’s appeal. Long-term holders benefit from continuous token demand that stems from its distribution system and purchase mechanism. Mutuum Finance’s Innovative Edge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team works diligently toward a Certik audit of their smart contract while pursuing its completion. Social media will publish a formal announcement to announce the completion date which will heighten investor trust. Users can now monitor the leaderboard of the top 50 MUTM holders who receive bonus tokens from maintaining their positions through a dashboard launch. The gamified motivation system increases user engagement then intensifies FOMO during the final moments of phase 4. MUTM stands as a DeFi leader in the market because of its ongoing $7.3 million presale while demonstrating practical use cases which enables competitive token value over speculative digital currencies. Mutuum Finance’s Market Moment The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) opportunity currently presents investors with the chance to enter the market for $0.025 ahead of the upcoming phase 5 price shift. The 35X potential of MUTM outpaces Solana along with Shiba Inu due to its strong lending system and specialized tokenomics design. High returns together with practical utility functions as a key requirement in the crypto market industry and MUTM fulfills this need.

Through the new Morpho Mini App and browser-based Oku Trade interface, users can earn rewards or take out loans without selling their assets. Verified users with a World ID will receive priority access to $5 million in token rewards distributed over the next year, a first for Morpho on any blockchain. World Chain’s human-first design plays a key role in this rollout. Gas fee subsidies for verified users make micro-lending feasible, while World ID enables reward targeting to real users rather than bots.

To read full editions, subscribe . Worldcoin — usable via the World mobile app — is finally launching in the US and making a big splash with a slew of big integrations. World cofounder and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman briefly took the stage during the live event Wednesday night and declared: “I am a very proud American.” Thanks for that, Sam. Orbs in America US residents can now get their irises scanned to claim some WLD tokens as part of an ongoing airdrop. Iris-scanning Orbs are being set up in Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville and San Francisco to start (sorry, New Yorkers). Those in the US who pre-registered for World have also been airdropped 150 WLD, which is about $150. The for-profit firm Tools for Humanity is the developer of World, and the nonprofit World Foundation is behind the Worldcoin token. TFH’s goal is to “verify” as many humans as possible and get people set up with World IDs so that humans can discern between AI or bot accounts and real human-run accounts. Users can get verified World IDs by getting their irises scanned by a metallic Orb (if this sounds dystopian to you, you’re not wrong). The next step in this vision is the Orb Mini, revealed Wednesday night. It looks like an eyephone with Apple Vision sockets on the back, if you ask me: NEW: the Orb Mini can scan to verify humans for the World Network pic.twitter.com/LbnuzU8OlO — The Drop (@thedropnft) May 1, 2025 The Orb Mini’s main purpose is to make scanning people’s irises easier, but at some point, it’s expected to also serve as a point-of-sale terminal. “We tried everything not to build a hardware device,” said Tools for Humanity CEO Alex Blania on developing the Orb concept. He also noted the company has spent “millions” on developing the Orbs. The Orb Mini as a point-of-sale would mean you could buy items using just your eyeballs, and the Orb would deduct the amount to be paid from your World wallet. Sounds like a Black Mirror episode — or like Amazon’s pay-with-your-palm thing. Until that day comes, you can pay for items with a World Visa card instead that pulls directly from your World wallet. The standard-size Orb has also been updated, which we knew about previously, and they’ve made a point of reminding us there’s an Nvidia chip in there. Orb manufacturing is being spun up in Texas, too. World 4.0 The World app received another big update with its 4.0 edition. Verified profile pictures and a Stripe integration are also being added. Within the World app, there’s now a prediction markets mini-app called Kalsi available to US residents where users can make predictions with WLD. Morpho, another miniapp, enables DeFi lending for World wallet users to borrow against crypto held in that wallet (Morpho’s also available for the US). Circle’s USDC is also being added natively to the World app, with plans for a Euro stablecoin to be added at some point. TFH is continuing its gaming plans with a “League of Humans” tournament with gaming tech firm Razer, will put Orbs in Razer stores, and may add its “Deep Face” tech to Razer webcams for deepfake prevention and human verification. During a press conference, the TFH team said South Korea is also a big focus for them because of the country’s strong presence in the gaming world. World ID badges on Tinder, Hinge, and Match will be piloted in Japan to verify dating profiles in the country. TFH says there are a total of 26 million World accounts now with 12 million verified users. Over 350 million World crypto wallet transactions have occurred in total. Despite all this news, the WLD token price didn’t do much — it climbed from about $1.02 at the start of the live event, rose to $1.16, and then fell back to $1.05 by the end of the night.

The product reduces the need for institutions to build their crypto platforms. Embed has already launched with bunq, a European neobank, as its first public partner. Kraken announced the launch of a new crypto-as-a-service product called Embed on April 30. The solution allows financial institutions to offer crypto trading directly to users through a single API integration. According to the announcement , Embed gives partners access to Kraken’s trading infrastructure and liquidity while offloading the operational demands of maintaining an in-house crypto marketplace. Institutions Get Crypto Trading with Kraken Financial institutions, including neobanks, fintechs, and traditional banks, can use the service to manage trading services programmatically, relying on Kraken’s regulatory and technical support. The product is already live through its first public partner, bunq, a European neobank. Additional integrations are expected to follow. “Kraken is a global leader in crypto, with over 15 years of experience operating one of the world’s most liquid crypto marketplaces,” said Kraken’s Head of Payments and Blockchain Brett McLain. “Our Crypto-as-a-Service solution enables a wide range of financial institutions to efficiently meet growing client demand without the complexity and overhead of running their own marketplace,” said McLain. He added that Embed would allow institutions to “adapt and thrive as crypto continues to gain mainstream adoption.” Layoffs and Preparation for U.S. Listing Kraken recently had another round of layoffs across multiple departments, marking the latest phase in its ongoing internal restructuring. The job cuts, reported to affect hundreds of employees, are part of a broader effort to streamline operations as the company prepares for a potential U.S. public listing in 2025. The exchange previously reduced its workforce by 15% in October 2024, including the departure of senior executives. Since the appointment of Arjun Sethi as co-CEO, the company has reportedly adopted a “rolling program” of layoffs while continuing to hire in select strategic areas. “Embed” comes at a moment when the regulatory environment for digital assets is beginning to stabilize in key markets. Rather than building full-scale crypto operations from scratch, institutions are increasingly turning to infrastructure providers to meet customer demand while staying within their compliance thresholds.

Both cryptocurrencies offer unique potential and distinct advantages in the market today. This article delves into the strengths and future prospects of each, providing insights to help determine which one stands out as the better investment. Will Aptos' innovative approach triumph, or will Celestia's promising technology take the lead? Aptos Market Update: Modest Rise Amid Persistent Downtrend Aptos price over the past month showed a modest gain of around 3.2%, while the six-month performance suffered a sharp decline of nearly 40%. This recent week's movement indicated a 1.5% upward trend, hinting at slight recovery efforts. However, long-term pressure on the asset remains evident, affecting overall performance. Current levels demonstrate a trading range of approximately $4.26 to $6.08, with immediate support near $3.17 and resistance around $6.80. Secondary levels are identified at $1.35 and $8.62. The RSI near 56 and modest momentum indicators suggest mixed control, indicating that traders may focus on consolidations within these key technical bounds for entry and exit points. Celestia: Steady Drops and Key Levels Offer Trading Opportunities Celestia lost about 10.70% in the last month and nearly 40% over the past six months. Price swings have been notable, showing a clear downward drift during both periods. Market behavior reflects bearish pressure, with a prolonged decline and no strong recovery. Recent figures indicate negative short-term sentiment, as the coin has struggled to reverse its overall downtrend. Current price is confined between $2.15 and $3.23. Resistance is seen at $3.77 while support is marked at $1.61, with a secondary resistance level at $4.84. Bears appear to be in control, and no clear trend has emerged. Traders may look for entry points near support and consider quick moves around resistance for potential short-term gains. Conclusion APT and TIA each have distinct strengths. APT shows promise with its quick transactions and solid backing. TIA stands out for its unique approach to decentralization. Both have potential in the market, but the choice depends on individual investment goals and risk tolerance. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

While the volume remains restricted within a range, the rise in the market capitalization suggests a notable rise in the bullish strength as the Bitcoin price rises past $97,000. Despite this rise, the token is expected to maintain a strong ascending trend and eventually reclaim $100K in a short while from now. The BTC price has consolidated for over a week and triggered a breakout above the range with capital influx and bullish sentiments swirling around $100K. On-chain data shows whales and the long-term holders are buying while the exchange reserves continue to drop. This generated a supply squeeze that pushed the price above the consolidated range. However, the price is required to rise above the ‘broken parabolic slope’ that may pave the way for a new ATH as suggested by crypto veteran Peter Brandt . Peter Brandt shared a historical chart of Bitcoin where the BTC price followed a parabolic curve in 2021 and formed a new ATH. Currently, the price has dropped below the curve, and a rise above the curve could trigger a strong bull run. The price is predicted to reach $125,000 to $150,000 by August-September 2025, but the analysts warn of a 50% or more correction after marking a new ATH. Here could be why the analyst foresees a massive drop. The open interest plays a major role in determining the mindset of the investors. The rise in open interest suggests the longs are paying the shorts, which indicates that longs have become dominant compared to shorts. Unfortunately, the open interest is still negative despite the price approaching $100K. The data from Coinanalyze shows that the Bitcoin funding rate has gone negative, while the predicted funding rate average is also negative. This suggests the shorts are still dominant over the longs, which circulates bearish clouds over the BTC price rally. However, the analyst believes that only the destruction of the USD may prevent the massive correction. Therefore, it would be interesting to watch the next Bitcoin (BTC) price action.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-01 17:45:58

He also said USD1 will integrate with the Tron network backed by billionaire Justin Sun. During the Token2049 in Dubai, Trump announced that the WLF USD stablecoin (USD1) was selected as the official stablecoin for MGX’s $2 billion investment in Binance. Zach Witkoff, the Co-founder of World Liberty Financial, teased more future partnerships for the DeFi protocol, adding that the platform aimed to establish USD1 as the preferred stablecoin in the DeFi and CeFi ecosystem, and the WLF team was working really hard on getting integrations into traditional retail point of sale systems.

The President’s son pointed out that the world was at the dialogue phase of the ‘crypto revolution,’ the people who were going to make it big were those who saw it today, ‘not in five years when half the explosive growth has happened’. He also criticized the inefficiencies and limited operating hours of the traditional financial system, calling it all a joke. Trump mentioned that sending funds internationally through SWIFT was slow, costly, and complex, emphasizing that crypto [almost] made banks redundant. An analysis report published by Statrys said the average transaction time on the SWIFT payment network was 20 hours and seven minutes. Additionally, 75% of SWIFT transactions involve one or two intermediary banks, meaning that these average 1 day and 11 hours to settle. However, a USDT or USDC stablecoin transaction on Ethereum settles within two to five minutes. “USD1 will become one of the most transparent and regulated stablecoins in the world…not only do we want to create a product in our stable point USD, one that can be sent across borders in a very seamless way, but transparency and frankly, consumer safety is paramount…” -Eric Trump, Son of President Donald Trump Witkoff also said the platform aimed to address the gaps that existed in the traditional financial system, including a lack of transparency, accessibility, and inefficiency in cross-border payments. According to Witkoff, the company’s aim was to democratize access to the financial system and bridge decentralized finance with traditional finance. Binance says the MGX deal was a major milestone for the exchange According to Binance, the MGX deal was the first institutional investment in Binance so far, the single largest investment into a crypto company, and the largest investment ever fully paid in crypto. Binance CEO Richard Teng also said the exchange’s ongoing investments in security and compliance reinforced the company’s mission to support a secure and trusted digital financial ecosystem. He added that the investment by MGX was a notable milestone for the crypto industry and Binance was working with regulators worldwide to establish transparent, responsible, and forward-thinking policies for the crypto industry. The investment will further solidify Binance’s presence in the Middle East, where it currently has over 1K employees, and strengthen its regulatory compliance and global expansion strategy. Teng said Binance was working with MGX to shape the future of digital finance, and the goal was to build a more inclusive and sustainable ecosystem with a strong focus on compliance, security, and user protection. Binance also launched ‘fund accounts’ recently, becoming the first crypto exchange to offer this feature. According to the exchange’s team, the initiative aimed to bridge the gap between crypto and traditional finance (TradFi) for institutional users, enhancing the platform’s appeal to professional investors like MGX.

As the world’s regulatory landscape evolves, this forum underscored LBank’s ongoing commitment to fostering a transparent, secure, and legally aligned Web3 ecosystem. Held at the prestigious Peregrine Ballroom, One&Only Royal Mirage, the forum gathered leading regulatory officials, legal experts, compliance professionals, and Web3 innovators to discuss the path forward towards a robust and sustainable compliance infrastructure for the crypto industry. With over 800 registered participants, highlighting the growing industry-wide focus on regulatory alignment. The forum featured two high-level panels: Panel 1: Smart Rules: Building Trust Through Embedded Compliance, moderated by Maleesha Gunawardana, Compliance Lead at LBank (UAE). Speakers included Dr. Ayesha Binlootah, Assistant Vice President at Dubai Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA); Dr. James Smith, Founder of Elliptic; ShiYun Chia, CEO of VerifyVASP; and Jason Allegrante, Chief Legal & Compliance Officer at Fireblocks. The discussion focused on several key topics, including Dubai’s regulatory readiness for the Travel Rule and how market participants can align with emerging virtual asset compliance frameworks. Dr. Ayesha Binlootah from VARA offered a regulatory perspective on how effective compliance can be embedded at both institutional and systemic levels. She emphasized that proactive regulatory frameworks and clear supervisory guidance are critical to building trust and resilience across the industry. Dr. James Smith, Founder of Elliptic, noted that as regulatory requirements grow increasingly complex, blockchain analytics is becoming a vital bridge for trust and collaboration between institutions and regulators. These tools help the market preemptively identify potential anomalies and enable proactive compliance implementation. Jason Allegrante, Chief Legal & Compliance Officer at Fireblocks, shared practical insights from an enterprise infrastructure perspective. He highlighted that one of the core challenges in technical compliance is maintaining user experience and operational agility while meeting high security and regulatory standards. ShihYun Chia, CEO of VerifyVASP, discussed how the Smart Rules framework supports the implementation of the Travel Rule in cross-border transactions. He shared how message standardization, the development of compliance signaling pathways, and improved interoperability are enabling the industry to build a more efficient and coordinated global network of virtual asset service providers. Panel 2: Global Playbooks: Navigating Compliance Across Jurisdictions, moderated by Harshil Agarwal, Senior Advisor at TLP Advisor. Speakers featured Rajesh Mohan, Digital Assets, Treasury & Traded Risk Management expert at Deloitte Middle East; Will Liao, Head of Fintech Innovation at PolyFlow; Sarah, Head of Payment Partnerships at Wello; and Mandy Ma, Senior Counsel at ALJAMHOR LAW. The second panel examined real-time compliance in global payment networks, particularly with the FATF’s Travel Rule and sanction screening mandates. Panelists discussed how blockchain and AI are transforming AML/KYC workflows and whether the industry has reached a tipping point in compliance technology adoption. Legal experts also shared insights into navigating the regulatory landscape in the GCC region, particularly in emerging markets like Saudi Arabia. The panel concluded with a discussion on the balance between regulatory harmonization and arbitrage, highlighting how evolving global frameworks like FATF and IOSCO may collide with fragmented national regimes. “It was a privilege to organize this important gathering in Dubai,” said David Gu, General Counsel of LBank. “The UAE has set a strong example in virtual asset regulation through its clarity and forward-thinking approach, and we’re especially grateful to VARA for its professionalism and vision. ‘Code Meets Law’ reflects our belief that the values that matter to humanity must be embedded into blockchain. As the industry evolves, we remain committed to advancing tech for good.” The successful execution of the “Code Meets Law” forum further solidifies LBank’s role as a key bridge between decentralized innovation and evolving global regulatory frameworks. By proactively engaging in compliance-centered discussions and fostering cross-jurisdictional collaboration, LBank continues to lead the industry toward a globally integrated and legally secure crypto environment.

Announced on May 1, the launch is a major step in Aztec’s mission to make privacy programmable and secure in the web3 ecosystem. The testnet follows years of research, development, and internal testing with more than 100 sequencers. Enhancing Privacy through Zero-Knowledge Proofs The testnet utilizes cutting-edge zero-knowledge (ZK) techniques to protect user data while maintaining Ethereum compatibility. This allows developers to build apps that can selectively conceal user data on-chain—without ceding control to any centralized party. Aztec’s in-house ZK proving system, PLONK, powers this privacy layer. Built in-house, PLONK enables fast verifiable proofs while supporting complex encrypted computations. It has been used previously in Aztec’s zk.money and Aztec Connect products. Noir: Making ZK Development Accessible On top of PLONK, Aztec has introduced Noir, its own programming language for zero-knowledge applications. Noir simplifies the development of private smart contracts without needing in-depth cryptographic knowledge. Developers can now focus on function while integrating strong privacy guarantees. The future of blockchain privacy is not black and white, Aztec co-founder Zac Williamson said. “Developers can leverage Aztec to build dApps with privacy functionality that’s natively integrated with Ethereum’s existing infrastructure,” he stated. Backed by Notable Funding Aztec’s release of testnet is backed by a $100 million Series B funding round led by a16z. The funding supports Aztec’s vision to scale encrypted smart contracts in the aim of supporting real-world use cases such as private DeFi, secure identity systems, and enterprise applications. a16z Crypto General Partner Ali Yahya said the investment was driven by Aztec’s ability to make privacy both scalable and accessible in web3.

The exchange said MOVE ( MOVE ) order books have already been switched to limit-only mode, meaning users can place or cancel limit orders, but trading at the market price is disabled. MOVE’s price dropped roughly 20% following Coinbase’s announcement, falling from $0.25 to $0.20.

In mid-April, the Movement Network was scrutinized after co-founder Cooper Scanlon took a leave of absence and reports surfaced of “market maker abnormalities.” Those abnormalities are now at the center of an investigation into a potential pump-and-dump scheme linked to a market maker called Web3Port. Internal documents obtained by CoinDesk reveal that Web3Port, a China-based firm, was assigned over 5% of MOVE’s total token supply, which was then allegedly routed through an obscure entity called Rentech. This arrangement allowed Rentech to offload MOVE tokens if the project’s fully diluted value exceeded $5 billion—an event that reportedly occurred on December 9, the day MOVE launched on Binance. BREAKING : $MOVE will delisted from @coinbase . Congratulations 🎊 to @movementlabsxyz @rushimanche pic.twitter.com/2MU1z5xWbz — Drop Bureau (@dropbureau) May 1, 2025 On that day, Web3Port liquidated 66 million MOVE tokens, generating $38 million in sales and triggering a sharp price decline. Those same tokens are now worth about $15.7 million. Contracts reportedly split the profits from such sales 50/50 between Rentech and the Movement Foundation. The Movement Foundation and Web3Port both have ties to World Liberty Financial Inc., a crypto venture backed by members of the Trump family. In January, WLFI purchased 3.42 million MOVE tokens for $1.5 million and also received a $10 million investment from Web3Port. Coinbase has not directly cited the pump-and-dump allegations in its delisting rationale but reiterated that it regularly monitors assets for compliance with listing standards.

Notably, there has been a renewed interest in meme coins. Retail traders are especially eyeing meme-themed coins at this time. President Trump’s campaign for his meme coin, TRUMP, might be credited with this fresh interest in speculative assets like meme coins. Notably, heightened campaign activity has sent the memecoin soaring by 54% in a single day, while social volume continues to rise. Meanwhile, leading memecoins Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are both struggling to find stability as the broader market bleeds. However, the market outlook for Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and XRP is still incredibly bullish. If Doge closes April above $0.20, the asset could revisit its previous all-time high at $0.74, according to a prominent analyst. A key pattern, the Accumulation Cylinder, has been spotted on Doge’s chart. The pattern typically signals key buying opportunities and hints that a price pump might be underway. “We don’t know what the catalyst will be, but something interesting is coming. Add here the BTC Dominance topping out, and we have a perfect recipe for a pump,” the analyst asserte d. While Shiba Inu’s price has declined alongside its trading volume, May has historically been a bullish month for the memecoin. If the asset mirrors its previous performance in the new month, a recovery may be recorded in the near term. At the time of this report, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are trading at $0.18 and $0.00001367, respectively. Interestingly, keywords such as “altcoin” and “alt season” have been trending on social media, hinting that positive sentiments for altcoin season have increased. Meanwhile, market players may have to wait to reap profits, particularly when market hype subsides. As Santiment noted, “History has shown that the most opportune entries into any sort of altcoin cycle are when the crowd is showing complete disinterest in altcoins.”",Cryptocurrency|News|Cardano|Ethereum News|SHIBA INU|Solana|XRP News,EN,0,0,ADA|MARKET|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-01 18:00:00

This major update will make the Ethereum network more scalable and efficient, and more. Similarly, Layer 2 solutions are getting popular, reducing transaction costs and network performance. While Ethereum is still making headlines, smart investors have been looking at another opportunity that can give them 100x returns. Enter Ruvi AI (RUVI) , a project that combines blockchain with artificial intelligence, giving crypto investors a chance to 100x their portfolio. Why Ruvi AI is Getting Attention Ruvi AI is a blockchain based platform that uses artificial intelligence to solve real world problems. Instead of focusing on speculative market appeal, Ruvi AI is solving industries like logistics, finance and supply chain management with practical applications. From fraud detection to data analysis, Ruvi AI’s technology provides value that goes beyond the usual hype. The project recently launched its beta product and it’s showing its utility and commitment to delivering solutions. This practical focus sets it apart as a project designed for longevity and utility, making it very attractive to investors who want more than hype driven gains. Ruvi AI’s Presale Success Ruvi AI has already shown its potential through a successful presale launch. Over 10 million tokens were sold in just a few days, raising over $100,000. Currently the token is priced at $0.01, but this won’t last long. As the presale moves into phase 2 the token price will increase by 50%, so early investment is crucial to maximize returns. Adding to this momentum, Ruvi AI rewards its early backers through a VIP incentive program, giving extra benefits to big investors. VIP Tier 2 Benefits Ruvi AI’s structured presale incentives provide a rare opportunity to maximize returns. Investors who accumulate 50,000 tokens qualify for VIP Tier 2, which comes with a 40% bonus, that’s an extra 20,000 tokens for free. At the current price of $0.01 per token, this would cost $500 but the investor will end up with 70,000 tokens. With Ruvi AI’s listing price set at $0.07, this $500 investment would be worth $4,900 immediately upon listing. But that’s not all. If market projections hold and Ruvi AI’s token reaches $1, this $500 investment would be worth $70,000, a 13,900% ROI. It’s structured incentives like these that make Ruvi AI an attractive option for those looking for high growth in the crypto space. Why Ruvi AI is A Smart Investment While Ethereum is focusing on scaling and solving its network issues, Ruvi AI offers a more revolutionary proposition. Its applications go to areas where businesses are actively looking for smarter solutions. Here’s why Ruvi AI stands out as a better opportunity to amplify your portfolio: Real-World Utility Unlike many speculative tokens, Ruvi AI provides solutions for industries. Its AI driven approach makes it a valuable tool for fraud prevention, operational efficiency and predictive analytics. Momentum in Its Early Stages The presale success shows strong demand from forward thinking investors. With more updates and developments down the line, Ruvi AI is set for massive long term growth. Strong Incentives for Early Investors The VIP rewards system, including the detailed Tier 2 plan, makes it very attractive for those who get in early. AI and Blockchain Combo By combining two technologies, Ruvi AI opens up opportunities for business efficiency, making it attractive to many industries. Timing is Everything Ethereum is evolving and blockchain is proving to innovate. But for those looking for higher returns in shorter timeframes, Ruvi AI is a much better option. The presale is moving fast and token prices will increase soon, so the window to get in early is closing. Imagine getting in on Ethereum or Bitcoin early. For many the regret of missing out on these giants still lingers. Don’t make the same mistake again with Ruvi AI. Early backers of Ruvi AI have the chance to be part of a project that doesn’t just promise but delivers. What to Do Next If you’re looking to diversify your crypto portfolio, Ruvi AI is worth a look. Its blockchain and AI combo intrigues and delivers solutions businesses need. Add this to the presale’s momentum and the VIP Tier 2 rewards and you have a once in a lifetime opportunity for massive returns. Visit Ruvi AI’s website to join the presale and get your tokens today. By investing now you not only get the early prices but position yourself for the kind of growth that can turn portfolios into fortunes. Don’t wait; opportunities like this don’t last!

Unstaked, Polygon, and Dogecoin Could Deliver Bigger Gains by 2025",https://nulltx.com/xrp-comeback-unstaked-polygon-and-dogecoin-could-deliver-bigger-gains-by-2025/,"XRP Eyes $5, But Unstaked and These Altcoins Could Deliver Bigger Gains First As XRP gains momentum toward a long-awaited recovery, a new wave of altcoins could steal the spotlight. Unstaked (UNSD), Polygon (POL), and Dogecoin (DOGE) are emerging as prime candidates for investors chasing outsized returns before XRP’s next major milestone at $5. Early-stage projects like Unstaked are gaining traction for offering exposure to entirely new market sectors, while established players like Polygon and Dogecoin continue to capitalize on their expanding ecosystems. Let’s break down why these three altcoins could deliver significant upside even before XRP completes its comeback. XRP: Recovery in Motion, but Competition Is Heating Up Currently trading near $2.30, XRP has stabilized after months of volatility. Analysts remain split on its short-term targets: projections range from $2.84 to $3.77 by year-end, with some outliers suggesting $5.81 or even $10 depending on regulatory approvals and broader market conditions. Key catalysts include speculation around XRP ETFs, the expansion of RippleNet into global banking partnerships, and final rulings on Ripple’s legal battles. While XRP’s long-term fundamentals remain strong, short-term price movements will likely hinge on external market factors and investor sentiment shifts. For now, XRP’s climb toward $5 is underway, but gains could unfold gradually rather than explosively. Altcoins Poised for Major Upside While XRP recovers, three altcoins present near-term opportunities for aggressive growth,and Unstaked leads the pack. Unstaked (UNSD): Building the Future of Web3 AI Unstaked (UNSD) is capturing early investor interest by offering something completely different: a decentralized AI agent economy built for real-world Web3 applications. Priced at just $0.006695 during Stage 2 of its presale, Unstaked empowers users to deploy autonomous AI agents that can post, moderate, and grow online communities across platforms like Telegram and X. Unlike many speculative AI projects, Unstaked will have functioning agents verified through its Proof of Intelligence framework. With a projected launch price of $0.1819, early buyers could capture over 2,600% upside if adoption scales. Backed by a $20 million liquidity pool and no private VC allocations, Unstaked positions itself as the AI layer for Web3’s next evolution. Investors looking for ground-floor exposure to a booming sector should have Unstaked high on their watchlists. Polygon (POL): Strengthening Its Ethereum Scaling Leadership Polygon continues to solidify its role in Ethereum’s scaling strategy. Trading around $0.22, Polygon benefits from growing dApp adoption, enterprise partnerships, and Layer 2 solutions like zkEVM. Analysts forecast that POL could surge toward $6.25 if Ethereum usage accelerates and scaling demands increase. While competition from other Layer 2s remains a challenge, Polygon’s first-mover advantage and strong developer ecosystem keep it well-positioned. It’s a lower-risk, medium-reward pick compared to earlier-stage projects like Unstaked, but remains a core altcoin to watch. Dogecoin (DOGE): Sentiment-Driven but Still Resilient Dogecoin is never far from the spotlight. Trading at $0.179, DOGE continues to thrive on community enthusiasm and broader crypto market rallies. Analysts project short-term upside toward $0.31, especially if altcoin season gains strength or another wave of celebrity endorsements pushes Dogecoin into mainstream news cycles. While fundamentally weaker than Unstaked or Polygon in terms of utility, Dogecoin’s viral potential and low entry price continue to attract speculative buyers looking for quick upside. Why Unstaked Stands Out Now XRP’s comeback story is far from over, but new opportunities are forming faster elsewhere. Unstaked (UNSD) offers a real, functional AI economy at a time when Web3 desperately needs scalable growth mechanisms. Meanwhile, Polygon’s scaling leadership and Dogecoin’s community-driven surges remain strong but carry very different risk profiles. For investors willing to think ahead and bet on the infrastructure of tomorrow, Unstaked’s combination of low presale entry, working technology, and massive sector potential offers a rare window of opportunity before the broader market catches on.

The analyst indicated that the altcoin could reach double digits if this breakout plays out as expected. XRP Price Eyes Rally To $55 With Potential Macro Channel Breakout In an X post, Egrag Crypto raised the possibility of a macro channel breakout for the XRP price and stated that the measured move points to a potential high of $55. He stated that he had his eyes on the $27 target, although he indicated that the altcoin will likely surpass this price level on this move as it looks to hit $55. Related Reading: Is The XRP Price Rally Over At $2.22? New Developments Suggest Major Pump Is Coming This ultra-bullish prediction came as the analyst revealed that the XRP price is currently in candle number 5. He remarked that if history is any guide, then market participants should be looking at a mega monthly candle. If XRP were to follow the same pattern, the analyst affirmed that the target of $17 is definitely in play. In another X post, Egrag Crypto again predicted that the XRP price could at least reach $27 in this market cycle. He stated that he is becoming increasingly convinced that XRP is mirroring the 2017 bull run, although the timing may be either delayed or accelerated. The analyst predicted that the altcoin would reach double digits by the end of Wave 3 this summer. Meanwhile, he believes Wave 4 will unfold over the next three years, followed by a bear market, and then the XRP price will reach triple digits in the next bull run. Egrag Crypto is confident that XRP could reach as high as $120 when that time comes. In the meantime, XRP is still battling to break above key resistance levels, which could pave the way for a new all-time high (ATH). A Bull Pennant Forming On Weekly Chart In an X post, crypto analyst XRPunkie drew attention to a bull pennant that was forming for the XRP price on the weekly chart. He stated that this bullish pattern is ready for a breakout once XRP completes the final pullback to between $1.80 and $2. The analyst added that the technical target of this bull pennant is between $13 and $14. XRPunkie warned that there will be more pullbacks along the way to $14, so he advised that investors look to secure profits. Related Reading: Analyst Sets XRP Price Target At $6.5, These Dates Are Key Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has indicated that the short-term target for the XRP price is between $2.70 and $2.90.

Backed by strong technicals, rising institutional interest, and real-world adoption signals, these four assets are showing signs of continued acceleration. Whether you’re investing with $684 or more, the market is offering strategic entry points that could deliver meaningful returns. XRP and Ethereum Remain Pillars of Strength XRP , trading around $2.15 , continues to benefit from growing ETF exposure. With ProShares’ XRP futures ETF already launched and CME’s version expected soon, institutional interest is ramping up. Analysts are keeping a close eye on the $2.45 resistance zone—breaking that level could spark renewed momentum through the next quarter. Ethereum (ETH) , sitting near $1,736 , maintains bullish momentum supported by whale accumulation and expanding ecosystem utility. As more AI and data-driven projects integrate with Ethereum, the network’s appeal grows. Analysts see further upside ahead, especially if ETH holds above its current support and approaches the $2,500 range. Kaspa and Aptos Bring Technical and Adoption Upside Kaspa (KAS) is priced around $0.10 , standing out for its blockDAG technology and rising interest in scalable proof-of-work alternatives. Forecasts suggest that if positive sentiment continues, KAS could move toward the $0.30 range as new capital flows into efficient infrastructure coins. Aptos (APT) , currently around $9.35 , surged recently with an 18% gain in just one week. The announcement that Aptos will serve as the digital wallet provider for Expo 2025 Osaka has added credibility and visibility. This real-world utility has given traders fresh confidence in APT’s future trajectory.

In a new video, the trader pseudonymously known as DonAlt tells the 66,300 subscribers of the TechnicalRoundup YouTube channel that ETH is his top pick in the crypto market, other than Bitcoin. “I like the chances of ETH. I think people are underestimating ETH just because it’s had bad price action, the same way people were [trash] talking Solana when it had bad price action, not because the coin was bad, just because of bad price action, like people were just joking about Solana all the time when it was trading below two digits, and then it went from nothing basically to $250. I think ETH is in a somewhat similar situation, but obviously Solana is taking a little bit of a bid away from from ETH.” Source: DonAlt/YouTube He also says that ETH against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) is holding key historic support levels on the weekly chart, indicating the top altcoin by market cap still has a good chance of a breakout. “When you look at the price history of ETH, it’s still trading multiples above where it traded against Bitcoin in 2015. It’s still trading multiples above where it was trading in 2017. It did retrace the 2020 move, which is quite a big deal. But I generally think people are just like, Oh yeah, look at that. And then they ignore all the left side… [ETH/BTC is] not the worst. It’s obviously not great. But this is not the worst. If I had to pick one asset other than Bitcoin in crypto for the long term, it would still be ETH for me.” Source: DonAlt/YouTube ETH/BTC is trading for 0.01914 BTC ($1,856) at time of writing, up nearly 2% in the last 24 hours.

While Ethereum enjoys first-mover advantages and widespread adoption through DeFi and NFTs, Cardano has opted for carefully phased rollouts, emphasizing stability, formal verification, and rigorous research-backed protocols. That patience may finally be paying off. According to the data Mintern highlighted, Cardano’s core developer activity—measured by meaningful GitHub commits and code contributions—has now outpaced Ethereum’s on a 12-month basis. This isn’t merely a metric of volume; it reflects consistent, long-term developer engagement with the protocol’s core systems, a strong indicator of ecosystem vitality and innovation momentum. What This Means for the Blockchain Landscape Ethereum has historically set the gold standard for blockchain development. As the foundation of most decentralized applications, smart contracts, and Layer 2 solutions, it has long been viewed as the leading platform for Web3 innovation. However, as Ethereum continues to face scalability bottlenecks, high gas fees, and the complexities of its evolving roadmap post-Merge, newer blockchains like Cardano are seizing the opportunity to iterate and improve. Cardano’s recent surge in developer activity coincides with several groundbreaking developments, including the rollout of the Leios scaling architecture , advancements in Hydra for off-chain processing, and steady progress toward Voltaire—the network’s decentralized governance era. These initiatives are not just theoretical; they’re translating into a groundswell of development participation that’s now visibly overtaking even Ethereum. Is This the Flippening No One Expected? The term “flippening” has historically referred to a hypothetical moment when Ethereum surpasses Bitcoin in market capitalization. But now, a different kind of flippening may be unfolding—one based not on price, but on innovation and developer commitment. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Cardano’s rise to the top in this key metric suggests that the blockchain wars may no longer be a two-player game dominated by Bitcoin and Ethereum. Instead, Cardano is proving that thoughtful, scalable, and community-driven innovation can command attention and resources—even without the hype that typically surrounds newer, flashier chains. A New Phase for Cardano—and the Industry This milestone may prompt a reevaluation across the industry about how success is measured in blockchain development. While total value locked (TVL) and market cap remain dominant indicators, developer activity is arguably the most telling sign of a protocol’s future relevance. Without developers pushing the boundaries of what’s possible, even the most capital-rich ecosystems risk stagnation. For Cardano, overtaking Ethereum in this regard is not just symbolic—it’s a signal that the blockchain’s methodical, research-first model is gaining serious traction among builders and researchers alike. As regulatory pressures mount and scalability becomes a priority across the space, Cardano’s mature and measured approach could be exactly what the next era of crypto requires. Mintern’s post captured the excitement and disbelief surrounding this flippening. But for those closely following Cardano’s journey, this development may be less surprising and more overdue. The real question now is: will the rest of the industry catch up to what Cardano’s builders already know? Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

At the same time, the last days the cost of the main cryptocurrency balanced in the zone of 95 thousand dollars and until today did not show sharp jumps. It turns out that there is indeed a correlation between these two indicators. In this regard, experts explained when to expect a new, larger BTC growth wave. What will happen to the Bitcoin price? Bitcoin exceeded the level of 97 thousand dollars this afternoon. The 15-minute chart of the cryptocurrency on the Binance exchange ends up looking like this: All this is happening against the backdrop of the withdrawal of coins from trading platforms. According to CryptoPotato source, some BTC is leaving exchanges for cold wallets, which is traditionally a bullish signal due to investors' long-term confidence in Bitcoin's growth. However, a significant portion of the coins are going into institutional storage. These are structures like ETF, which attract funds from major industry players. Here's a comment on what's going on. The coins aren't disappearing anywhere. They are simply moved to a new location for active use. In addition, not all of these BTC remain unmoved. Some are stored passively and some participate in structured products, yield platforms or are used as collateral. That is why the price of the first cryptocurrency does not grow instantly, analysts note. This is also true for the whole crypto market, as altcoins are largely dependent on what happens with BTC. Bitcoin is still a market, and in a market, sellers don't disappear anywhere. Some market players are traders aiming for short-term profits. Others are long-term holders locking in profits. There are also those who never realized what they bought. Experts also commented on the ongoing accumulation of bitcoins by Michael Saylor's Strategy company. According to them, miners mine about 13,500 BTC per month, but Strategy, resorting to various capital borrowing instruments, has been buying more than the aforementioned value of bitcoins for several months in a row. Thus, the company, which has become the largest institutional holder of BTC, has produced a kind of ”synthetic halving,” that is, a reduction in the volume of available cryptocurrency. They're not just hoarding, they're shrinking Bitcoin's supply curve externally. So yes, supply is shrinking. But the price moves when demand breaks equilibrium. And with an infinite volume of currency and a truly scarce asset, Bitcoin's next spurt won't be linear. It will be dramatic. And most likely irreversible. At the end of April, Bitcoin was up 14 percent, while Ethereum fell in price by 1.5 percent. Solana showed the best result and rose in price by 18.7 percent. Adoption of cryptocurrencies in the US Meanwhile, the North Carolina House of Representatives has passed a bill that would authorize the state to invest in digital assets - the initiative now moves to the Senate for further debate. The bill, HB92, was introduced on Feb. 10 and passed its third reading in the House on Wednesday. The document, chiefly authored by Republican Speaker Destin Hall, would allow the state to invest in qualified digital assets and consider including them in retirement plans for public employees. The bill directs the state treasurer's office to study suitable investment vehicles, propose contribution limits and develop educational materials explaining the risks of investing in digital assets. HB92 also proposes to investigate the possibility of creating a state reserve for confiscated or seized crypto assets, which would be overseen by the state Bureau of Investigation in coordination with law enforcement. On March 19, a second piece of legislation, SB 327, was filed in support of the House bill in North Carolina. This initiative would allow up to 10 percent of state funds to be channeled into Bitcoin, creating a formal reserve and enabling strategies for steaking, lending, and yield. The document, introduced by Republican Senators Todd Johnson, Brad Overkesh and Timothy Moffitt, positions Bitcoin investment as a ”financial innovation strategy” to enhance the state's economic potential. It has already passed its first reading in the Senate and has been sent to committee, where it must overcome several steps, including further readings, to become law. North Carolina isn't the only state going down the path of crypto adoption. Arizona, New Hampshire and Texas are also considering similar Bitcoin reserve legislation. At least a dozen other states are considering similar initiatives, some of which are simultaneously working on multiple cryptocurrency bills. A number of states, including Indiana and Florida, are discussing adding digital assets to the list of options for retirement systems. The bottom line The declining volume of bitcoins on exchanges and active purchases by institutional investors are creating a foundation for the next stage of market growth. Although the price is still reacting with restraint, experts have no doubts about the industry's prospects. In their opinion, the shortage of supply and growing interest on the part of the authorities and large investors in the United States will sooner or later end with a noticeable increase in the volatility of the digital asset.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-01 18:15:36

The coin, which caused its users to have expectations with the big update, has lost 30% of its value since the transition period. Sonic, a major project worth $1.65 billion, is headed by Andre Cronje, who is also the lead developer of Fantom and is considered by some to be the founder of the DeFi world. *This is not investment advice.
