DOGEN Rejoys Big Moment: Trump‚Äôs Victory Will Send It to the Moon Guess who is going to join Elon Musk‚Äôs moon mission soon? DOGEN, the boldest meme coin for alpha males, is gearing up for take-off as Trump's victory in the recent US election has the entire market euphoric about the prospects of cryptocurrencies, especially meme coins. Donald and Elon are Best Buddies for Meme Coins Donald Trump‚Äôs love for crypto is no secret ‚Äî he‚Äôs promised to make the U.S. the global crypto leader in his campaign.

Flex Hard, Earn Big ‚Äì DOGEN is Your Power Move! Cardano's ADA: A Sustainable and Scalable Blockchain Platform Cardano is a flexible and scalable blockchain platform designed for smart contracts. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, competes with Ethereum's ETH. Users can store value, make payments, and stake on the Cardano network. Cardano uses the energy-efficient Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, unlike the energy-intensive proof-of-work model. It divides its blockchain into two layers: one for transactions and one for smart contracts. This enhances its ability to process up to a million transactions per second. Cardano tokens, introduced in March 2021, offer secure, low-fee interactions with smart contracts. This sets a new benchmark for blockchain efficiency and scalability. Given its technological advances and sustainable approach, ADA looks attractive in the current market cycle. Polkadot (DOT): Connecting Blockchains for a More Scalable Future Polkadot (DOT) is a decentralized protocol and cryptocurrency that enables secure communication between different blockchains. It allows value and data to be shared across blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin without intermediaries. Polkadot uses parachains to improve speed and scalability, processing more transactions than Bitcoin and Ethereum. The DOT token is used for governance and staking, letting holders participate in development and transaction verification. Developed by Gavin Wood, a co-founder of Ethereum, and launched on May 26, 2020, Polkadot aims to create more interconnected and efficient blockchains. In the current market cycle, Polkadot's technology and potential to enhance blockchain interoperability continue to draw interest. Conclusion In the current bull run, while ADA and DOT have less short-term potential, DOGEN offers massive growth. Designed for those seeking luxury and success, it expects 700% presale growth with potential thousand-fold returns. Following tokens like BONK, DOGEN builds a community of market leaders and offers real value through exclusive perks for early adopters.

The platform consists of three interoperable chains‚Äîthe X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain‚Äîthat handle various operations like transactions and smart contracts. AVAX is the native token of Avalanche, used for transaction fees, staking to secure the network, and operating customizable Subnets. The technology allows users to create their own tokens and blockchains. With its strong utility, high performance, and eco-friendly design, AVAX holds potential in the current market cycle. Solana's SOL: A High-Speed Platform for Decentralized Applications Solana is a blockchain platform designed for scalability and speed, offering a foundation for decentralized applications alongside competitors like Ethereum and Cardano. Its architecture enables faster transactions and flexible development across multiple programming languages. SOL, the native cryptocurrency of Solana, is central to its ecosystem, facilitating transactions, running custom programs, and rewarding network participants. The coin holds value by underpinning the operation of the Solana network, allowing users access to a suite of projects. Unlike some platforms, Solana avoids sharding or second-layer solutions, aiming to attract developers and investors with its high-capacity network capable of hosting high-activity products and services. In the current market cycle, Solana's technology continues to garner attention for its scalability and efficiency.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) , market capitalization‚Äôs second-largest meme coin, posted 3% losses in the last 24 hours as the selloff took a sharp turn. Other meme tokens have traded along similar lines, further plunging market sentiments. In the last 24 hours, whales have offloaded huge SHIB tokens, pushing the asset further into the red zone. Crypto analytics firm Lookonchain flagged a huge sale activity. A crypto whale sold 250 billion SHIB tokens worth approximately $6 million, aiming to take profits before further damage. The trader‚Äôs SHIB portfolio stands in profit after scooping 15.28 trillion SHIB for $3.8K in August 2020. From that point, the meme coin‚Äôs price has soared following bull cycles and mass accumulations from the community. The whale holds $52 million worth of assets after raking in $109 million in profits. This transaction follows previous trends from other whales dumping the asset. On Dec 16, 43 billion tokens were transferred to an unknown wallet, raising community reactions. Meme coins are susceptible to high swings because of prices and market structure. Rally After The Storm Amid a downtrend, meme coins can spark a frenzy on a wider crypto bulk cycle. SHIB bulls remain optimistic for an uphill run, which U.S. institutional investors will likely spark . Before the dip, the asset soared above 90% since the United States elections. Market bulls poured funds into meme coins in expectation of easing regulations in the country, a catalyst to drive the next upward momentum. Similarly, institutional investors also moved assets to reposition ahead of next year‚Äôs projections. Crypto enthusiasts investinghaven explained the possibility of a turnaround on X (formerly Twitter). ‚Äú$ SHIB: 2025 Price Outlook This chart shows Shiba Inu‚Äôs price could peak near $0.0000998 in 2025, while the potential low is at $0.0000234. The path to these targets may see volatility, but it reflects broader crypto market trends. Patience could pay off for #SHIB.‚Äù Another factor that could spur increased accumulation is the altcoin season . This is characterized by fund flows from Bitcoin to other assets in a cycle. Several analysts have tipped an incoming altcoin season this month as whales move assets to other assets. However, volatility remains a key factor, with recent outflows and dwindling sentiments.",Cryptocurrency|News|SHIB|SHIBA INU,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-27 22:09:15

Focusing on Ripple could be a concerning precedent for future digital asset regulations in the U.S. This battle between the US Securities and Exchange Commission and Ripple Labs is so important in the crypto world that many are concerned with the regulations by the U.S. government toward its digital assets. SEC‚Äôs focus on Ripple while overlooking bigger issues Fox Business Reporter Charles Gasparino was critical of other high-profile cases with Sam Bankman-Fried, but the SEC‚Äôs action against Ripple and its native cryptocurrency, XRP, got attention. Gasparino argues that the SEC is focusing on Ripple, which may be irrelevant, especially since bigger fish (Sam Bankman) are floating in the finance world. This case has gone far beyond Ripple and is bound to rewrite how the U.S. will continue to regulate its cryptocurrencies from now on. In an interview he said, Ripple Labs and Chief Executive Officer Brad Garlinghouse feel the SEC went too far. They consider the case filed in December 2020 not only an attack on Ripple but also on the cryptocurrency industry at large. Garlinghouse has also voiced his criticism of the SEC, arguing that the case will be a bad precedent for the entire industry. He further argued that the SEC does not know how to regulate cryptocurrency and that it does not appreciate the distinction between digital assets and others. Ripple vs. SEC Ripple reportedly stated its frustration at the SEC‚Äôs failure to provide clear guidance on what a company operating in the space of cryptocurrencies and related companies should do in the regulations. Ripple partially won in the court judgment made in 2023 since it ruled that XRP sold on secondary markets cannot be considered a security. The judgment separates XRP from other traditional securities transactions and brings great victory to Ripple. However, the court held that XRP‚Äôs direct sales to institutional investors are securities transactions, further pointing to the complexity of the case and the differing nature in which XRP is applied in different contexts. There is an argument that digital assets like XRP must be treated exactly the same way as the real securities inside, with general grounds that protect investors from fraud. Gary Gensler is the SEC chair then. Mr. Gensler maintains that the crypto marketplace should follow securities laws. To him, XRP, among others, has a duty to comply with securities laws for the protection of investors. In fact, the statements released by the company in 2021 have Gensler referring to Bitcoin and Ethereum as commodities but many other tokens and cryptocurrencies as likely being securities and therefore subject to the regulations. According to the SEC, Ripple sales of XRP should be considered securities, whether these are institutional or retail sales, and therefore fall within the same rules of sales that apply to stock and bonds. This being the case, the greater conversation is about how the US government should regulate cryptocurrency. Critics have pointed out the aggressive stance that the SEC has taken towards Ripple.

Ethereum: A Leading Proof-of-Stake Blockchain with Growing Potential Ethereum is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain known for smart contracts and a wide range of decentralized applications. It supports decentralized finance and uses Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon to improve transaction efficiency. Ethereum introduced ERC-20 tokens, which are used across various applications, but transactions still require ETH for gas fees. Since its launch in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum has evolved, transitioning to Proof-of-Stake with the Merge in 2022. The upcoming sharding phase aims to enhance scalability and reduce costs. Ether (ETH) remains central, facilitating transactions and rewarding stakers. Based on historical price movements and BTC halving cycles, Ethereum's price predictions suggest potential growth. These developments may make Ethereum attractive in the current market cycle. XRP: A Fast, Low-Cost Cryptocurrency for Global Transactions XRP is a cryptocurrency that operates on the XRP Ledger. It is designed to be fast, low-cost, and open. XRP allows for borderless transactions that are resistant to censorship and counterfeiting. It does not rely on a central authority, making transactions secure and irreversible. XRP was created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz. They launched it with a supply of 100 billion tokens. Ripple received 80 billion XRP to improve network liquidity and support the ecosystem. Ripple uses XRP to facilitate quick and efficient transfers across different currencies. In the current market cycle, XRP's technology and potential applications may make it an interesting option for global payments. Conclusion As the bull run unfolds, traditional coins like ETH and XRP show less short-term potential. Investors are shifting to DOGEN, a meme token for those seeking luxury and success. Expected to grow 700% by the presale's end with potential for massive returns, DOGEN builds a community of leaders and offers real benefits to early adopters.

The decision to extradite Kwon to the US rather than his native South Korea comes after Montenegro‚Äôs Constitutional Court dismissed the disgraced Terra founder‚Äôs appeal. Do Kwon To Face Trial In the US One of the most notorious figures in the crypto industry is set to be deported to the United States. The Montenegrin Minister of Justice, Bojan Bo≈æoviƒá, has approved the extradition of bombastic South Korean entrepreneur Do Kwon, the Ministry announced on Friday. ‚ÄúIt was concluded that most of the criteria provided by law support the request for extradition by the competent authorities of the United States of America,‚Äù a translated statement from Bo≈æoviƒá reportedly said, according to news publication Vijesti . This follows a decision from the Constitutional Court of Montenegro earlier this week, which rejected Kwon‚Äôs appeal against a previous Supreme Court ruling. In September, the Supreme Court nullified Kwon‚Äôs deportation to South Korea and indicated that the Balkan nation‚Äôs Minister of Justice would make the final extradition decision. Extradition Nightmare Kwon founded Terraform Labs, popularly known for its algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD (UST) and its sister token LUNA. Both assets imploded in May 2022, wiping out over $40 billion in investor wealth overnight and triggering a chain of bankruptcies throughout the cryptosphere, before its founder went on a run from law enforcement around the world. He was arrested in March 2023 in Montenegro while attempting to travel to Dubai using a fake passport. Since being released from jail this March, Kwon has faced lengthy legal proceedings , with courts deciding between dueling demands to send him to the US or South Korea. The US has been particularly vocal in pursuing his extradition as it seeks to hold him accountable for his role in the shambolic collapse of the Terra ecosystem. Notably, in June, a New York jury found Terraform Labs and Kwon liable for fraud in a lawsuit brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The verdict included six charges, including intentionally misleading investors, misrepresentations about the success and stability of Terra, and ‚Äúreckless‚Äù mishandling of customer money. In June, the controversial company and its once-fugitive founder were fined a whopping $4.5 billion by the SEC after reaching a ‚Äúsettlement in principle‚Äù. While it‚Äôs not the outcome Kwon was hoping for, signing the order to have him transferred to the United States should hopefully conclude the multi-year legal battle.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News|Terra|USA,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|LUNA|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-27 22:14:39

However, in the last month, the price has decreased by 19.60%, including an 8.97% drop in the past week. Currently, SOL is trading between $160.72 and $214.47, reflecting significant volatility. Technical indicators point to potential market trends. SOL is below both its 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages at $189.09 and $190.79, respectively. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 33.48, and the Stochastic oscillator is at 16.54, both suggesting the asset is nearing oversold conditions. The MACD level of -2.081 indicates bearish momentum may continue. Key support and resistance levels are crucial for SOL's price movement. The nearest support level is at $141.08; if the price falls below this, it could test the second support at $87.33. On the upside, breaking through the nearest resistance at $248.58 may propel the price toward the second resistance level of $302. This would represent a substantial percentage gain from current levels. Based on this data, SOL's price could rise if it surpasses resistance levels or fall further if it breaks below support levels. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum (ETH) has experienced notable price movements recently. Over the past week, its price dropped by 8.42%, bringing it within the current range of $2881.83 to $3892.12. The monthly change shows a smaller decline of 2.61%, and over the past six months, ETH has decreased by 1.57%. Technical indicators suggest potential shifts in ETH's price. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 26.14, indicating that the asset is oversold. The Stochastic value is 12.83, supporting this oversold status. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level stands at -33.83, which could signal a forthcoming change in momentum. Both the 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are close, at $3355.12 and $3400.11 respectively, hinting at a consolidation phase. Looking ahead, if ETH manages to surpass the nearest resistance level at $4504, it could aim for the second resistance at $5515, offering potential gains of over 15% and 40% respectively from current levels. Conversely, if it falls below the nearest support at $2483.85, the next support level is at $1473.56, which would represent a significant decrease. Traders are watching these key levels closely, as they may indicate substantial price movements in the near future. Kaspa (KAS) Kaspa (KAS) has been experiencing a noticeable decline in its price recently. Over the past week, the coin's value has dropped by approximately 10.7%. Looking at the monthly performance, it has decreased by about 23.9%. In the last six months, Kaspa has seen a significant reduction of around 36.5% in its price. Currently, KAS is trading in the range of $0.10 to $0.15, indicating a downward trend. The coin is approaching its nearest support level at $0.08. If the price dips below this point, the next support is at $0.0342, which could imply a further decline. On the upside, the immediate resistance level is at $0.18. Surpassing this could lead Kaspa toward the second resistance at $0.22, representing a potential increase of over 45% from its current lower range. Technical indicators suggest mixed signals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is around 30.8, and the Stochastic oscillator is approximately 10.6, both indicating that Kaspa may be entering oversold territory. The Simple Moving Averages for both 10 and 100 days are at $0.12, showing that the price is consolidating around this point. However, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level is negative at -0.001554, hinting at bearish momentum. Based on these factors, Kaspa's price could either continue to decline or potentially rebound if buying interest increases. Conclusion Though SOL, ETH, and KAS are promising, XYZVerse (XYZ), the pioneering all-sport memecoin, offers early adopters growth potential, blending sports enthusiasm with meme culture for significant gains.

This will usher in new growth, with surging adoption tapping an all-time high. Recent activities in the bull cycle have led to uphill projections, although price corrections threaten momentum. In a new document, Saylor rolled out a taxonomy and proposed rights and responsibilities for participants in the crypto space. Notably, this boils down to ramping up activity in the United States and becoming a leader in space. In the run-up to November polls, President-elect Donald Trump restated his stance on the U.S. becoming a global leader in blockchain, Bitcoin, and artificial intelligence. A New All-Time Market Cap? According to the document, US participation in the crypto market will strengthen its position and lead to fresh capital inflow. Specifically, the total digital capital market is estimated to soar from $2 trillion to $280 trillion, with US investors dominating the scene. Saylor asserted that this would strengthen the dollar and reduce the national debt. Following Donald Trump‚Äôs win, institutional investors recorded massive inflows, taking the market cap above $3 trillion. This pushed the price of Bitcoin above $90K and eventually tapped $107K as buying intensified. Although the market faced slight sell pressures, traders looked to pro-market regulations as Republicans control both houses of Congress. Inflows are expected to drive global adoption, taking the market cap to an all-time high. The main instrument for the upswing is a Bitcoin strategic reserve. Tipped by most stakeholders, it is expected to attract bulls and help the county lower its debt. US Senator Cynthia Lummis proposed a bill that will see the country acquire 1 million BTC per year to be held for at least 20 years. Lummis proposes selling gold reserves to fund Bitcoin purchases. Saylor also noted that digital asset growth without Bitcoin is expected to notch inflows. A Path To Clear Rules Although sentiments have largely flipped positive following the advancement of pro-crypto bills, much effort is still required to bring the US into line with other jurisdictions. Per the document, Saylor seeks a clear framework for issuers, owners, and crypto exchanges to avoid the plethora of lawsuits previously recorded. ‚Äú Path to Legitimacy: Establish a global, real-time, and uninterrupted process for issuing, trading, and owning digital assets by individuals, corporations, and machines. Issuers: Rights: The right to create and issue digital assets. Responsibilities: Ensure fair disclosure and ethical behavior. Exchanges: Rights: The right to custody, trade, and transfer assets between clients and other exchanges. Responsibilities: Publish asset disclosures, protect client assets, and avoid conflicts of interest,‚Äù the document reads.",Cryptocurrency|Featured|News|Michael Saylor|MicroStrategy,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-27 22:19:29

Solana (SOL) SOL has seen notable price movements recently. Over the past six months, it has risen by 34.50%. However, in the last month, the price has decreased by 19.60%, including an 8.97% drop in the past week. Currently, SOL is trading between $160.72 and $214.47, reflecting significant volatility. Technical indicators point to potential market trends. SOL is below both its 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages at $189.09 and $190.79, respectively. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 33.48, and the Stochastic oscillator is at 16.54, both suggesting the asset is nearing oversold conditions. The MACD level of -2.081 indicates bearish momentum may continue. Key support and resistance levels are crucial for SOL's price movement. The nearest support level is at $141.08; if the price falls below this, it could test the second support at $87.33. On the upside, breaking through the nearest resistance at $248.58 may propel the price toward the second resistance level of $302. This would represent a substantial percentage gain from current levels. Based on this data, SOL's price could rise if it surpasses resistance levels or fall further if it breaks below support levels. Dogecoin (DOGE) Over the past week, Dogecoin has fallen by 12.79%, extending a month-long drop of 20.41%. Despite this downward trend, the meme-based cryptocurrency boasts a six-month gain of 153.49%. This contrast highlights its volatile nature, offering significant returns over the long term even amid short-term losses. Technical indicators suggest Dogecoin might be oversold. The Relative Strength Index is at 28.36, and the Stochastic oscillator stands at 16.03‚Äîboth below typical oversold thresholds. Additionally, the 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are converging at $0.32, indicating potential price stabilization or a reversal. Looking ahead, Dogecoin faces resistance at $0.48 and stronger resistance at $0.63. Breaking through these levels could signal substantial upside, potentially leading to double-digit percentage gains. On the downside, support lies at $0.18, with a deeper support level at $0.0257. If prices slip below these points, further declines may follow. Traders are watching these key levels to gauge Dogecoin's next move. Conclusion With SOL, DOGE, and the innovative XYZVerse uniting sports fans and meme culture, these coins are poised to lead the crypto market's surge into 2025.

Buterin‚Äôs Christmas gift will go toward upgrading the zoo‚Äôs facilities and supporting its Wildlife Sponsorship program. Crypto Meets Conservation In a letter addressed to Khao Kheow‚Äôs director shared on X, the Russian-born programmer explained that his involvement stemmed from a recent visit to the facility, where he was captivated by its commitment to animal welfare and community engagement. He thanked the zoo for welcoming him and highlighted Moo Deng‚Äôs unique role as a cultural ambassador for Thailand. Buterin praised the animal sanctuary‚Äôs efforts and reiterated the importance of improving the pygmy hippo habitat. He also acknowledged Thailand‚Äôs hospitality to the Ethereum community, especially during Devcon SEA in Bangkok last November. The 30-year-old said he would donate no less than 10 million baht, approximately $300,000 in Moo Deng‚Äôs name, to be delivered in two installments. The first contribution was made on December 26, with the date for the second set to be communicated later. Buterin has also promised an extra 88 ETH to ensure ongoing support for the zoo‚Äôs projects. Earlier, the establishment had posted on X expressing its appreciation for the Ethereum developer‚Äôs generosity, calling him ‚Äúan adoptive father to Moo Deng.‚Äù He responded, sharing his enthusiasm for the role and quoting a popular line from the Star Trek shows: ‚ÄúMay they live long and prosper.‚Äù Market Performance Moo Deng, already a beloved symbol in Thailand, gained global fame as the face of the MOODENG coin. The token has captured the crypto community‚Äôs attention despite recent market fluctuations. At the time of this writing, it was changing hands at $0.2693, with a 24-hour trading volume of $179.7 million, representing a 50.3% surge in activity compared to the previous day. While the token‚Äôs price dipped 3.2% in the past 24 hours, it gained 6.1% over the past week, outperforming the broader crypto market, which had seen a 1.2% decline in that period. Buterin previously liquidated over $1 million worth of meme tokens donated to him, including 10 billion MOODENG, giving the proceeds to various charities. Interestingly, he was recently critical of the meme coin space, decrying the proliferation of celebrity-inspired tokens. He argued that it would be better if they had a public goal aimed at promoting a specific cause or at least incorporated fun mechanics going beyond trading.

38202219,https://invezz.com/?p=2407689,1735338403,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Pig butchering crypto scams cost users $3.6 billion this year,https://invezz.com/news/2024/12/27/pig-butchering-crypto-scams-cost-users-3-6-billion-this-year/,"Pig butchering scams were the leading attack vector for the cryptocurrency space in 2024, resulting in multi-billion dollar losses for millions of investors. According to data from web3 security firm Cyver‚Äôs annual fraud report, scammers managed to dupe crypto users out of a whopping $3.6 billion this year, with the attacks spanning over 150,000 addresses and 800,000 transactions. The number, while significant, presents a slight drop in losses compared to the previous year, when roughly $3.96 billion was lost to similar schemes. What are pig butchering scams? Often involving sophisticated social engineering tactics, pig butchering scams are long-term fraud schemes that thrive on emotional manipulation, fake credibility, and the promise of high returns, making them one of the most insidious threats in the cryptocurrency space. The term ‚Äòpig butchering‚Äô has been derived from the practice of fattening a pig before slaughter, similar to how scammers build trust and rapport with their targets over weeks or even months. Fraudsters approach victims in various ways. Sometimes, they pose as romantic interests, sometimes as financial mentors, and gradually coax victims into fishy crypto investments that are too good to be true. Victims are usually led to fake trading platforms where they often see manipulated dashboards that display impressive returns to gain their trust and encourage investments. Once the victim is fully invested, the scammer disappears with the funds, leaving victims with little recourse and often no way to recover their losses. However, in a rare turn of events last month, the Federal Bureau of Investigation recovered $8.3 million connected to a pig butchering scheme. The case involved the former chief executive of Heartland Tri-State Bank, who misappropriated $47.1 million in customer funds, which ultimately led to the bank‚Äôs collapse. With pig butchering scams becoming increasingly common, authorities all across the globe have increased efforts to track and dismantle these often large criminal networks. Earlier this month, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission in Nigeria arrested 792 suspects allegedly involved in orchestrating pig butchering scams. Cyber attacks on the rise However, pig butchering scams are merely the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the various types of threats that plague the cryptocurrency industry. The Cyvers report notes that hacking attacks targeting the sector jumped 40% compared to last year, with access control breaches and smart contract vulnerabilities causing the most damage. As previously reported by Invezz, a separate report from security firm Hacken also highlights a similar trend. Notably, the centralized finance sector was the most affected, with private key compromises and weak access controls emerging as primary vulnerabilities, contributing to 75% of all exploits in 2024. Besides the aforementioned schemes, phishing attacks remain another persistent threat to crypto users. Since cryptocurrencies are inherently digital and transactions occur entirely online, the ecosystem remains highly vulnerable to such attacks. Even though such losses have been steadily declining over the past months, the complex and stealthy nature of the attack makes it a common weapon in the crypto scammer‚Äôs arsenal. For instance, on December 26, scammers were seen exploiting Google ads to distribute crypto-stealing phishing scripts while mimicking the Pugy Penguins project website with the malicious content hosted on the Adloox tracking domain.

Get in now, watch Catzilla wreck the market, and bring chaos to the competition! Shiba Inu (SHIB): Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Expanding Utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a memecoin inspired by Dogecoin but built on the Ethereum blockchain. Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi, SHIB started with a quadrillion tokens. Half of the tokens were sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin, who donated and burned large amounts, increasing SHIB's visibility. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB's Ethereum base allows for applications like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange. There are plans for a future NFT platform and a DAO-based governance system. This integration with Ethereum's ecosystem gives SHIB potential for broader utility. In the current market cycle, SHIB's developments may attract interest due to its expanding features. Conclusion Coins like SHIB may have less short-term potential, while Catzilla aims to bring financial freedom to everyone. Offering a 700% ROI potential during its presale, the token starts at $0.0002 and rises to $0.0016 over 14 stages.

After the holidays, the asset manager becomes one of the biggest Ethereum (ETH) whales after copping 993,591.95 ETH. This is equivalent to $3.5 billion worth of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. BlackRock Benefits from Spot Ethereum ETF BlackRock achieved this feat through its ETH Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) with the ticker ETHA. As of December 27, the firm‚Äôs Ethereum holding represents 0.12% of Ethereum‚Äôs total supply. Consequently, BlackRock has risen to become the world‚Äôs 12th-largest altcoin holder. This marks a laudable feat for a firm whose history with Ethereum began only this year. Contextually, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot Ethereum ETF applications made by eight firms, including BlackRock, in July 2024 after a long wait . Ethereum Price Struggles Post-ETF Approval Since the approval of the funds, Ethereum has had a good time in terms of growth. In addition, Donald Trump‚Äôs victory in the last United States elections held in November also contributed to the price rally. At this writing, Ethereum traded at $3,313.42 after losing 1% of its 24-hour price gain. The altcoin has been stuck between critical psychological levels in the last few weeks. According to crypto analyst Rekt Capital, it has struggled to break above the $4,000 mark . The coin passed this threshold in the past and peaked at $4,077 on December 6. There are speculations that Ethereum could slip further down to the point of losing up to 10% of its current price level. BlackRock IBIT Records Largest Outflow BlackRock‚Äôs Bitcoin ETF has also recorded a lot of success this past few weeks, although it hit a roadblock recently. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) recorded its biggest outflow just a day before Christmas. This coincided with when the United States spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded four straight days of withdrawals, with over $1.5 billion missing. On Wednesday, IBIT made headlines because of a large outflow of $188.7 million . This was the largest that the fund had seen since its inception. In the coming weeks, which coincides with Donald Trump‚Äôs entry into office, the outlook of these funds may improve.

Related Reading: Dogecoin 600% Rally Prediction Still On Track Before End Of 2024 ‚Äî Analyst According to recent studies, historical price fluctuations show that the popular meme coin may experience another parabolic boom. Dogecoin has been notorious for its wild price swings, and many predict that the coming year will be critical to its progress. Historical Patterns Suggest Potential Gains Dogecoin has had a history of sharp price increases followed by declines. For instance, in 2017 it rose 210% prior to reversing, then suddenly jumped 5,000%. In 2021, it followed a pattern, initially rising 476% before a significant reversal that ended with an astonishing increase of 12,000%. Dogecoin is now up around 440% over the last year, but has lately had a 46% pullback. Analysts believe that this repeated pattern implies a potential significant rally. Dogecoin Bullish Forecasts For 2025 Many analysts have made quite optimistic projections on the course Dogecoin‚Äôs price might take over 2025. While some have ranged within $1 and $3, others have pegged it as high as $10. Investments CEO said in a post on Christmas Day that Dogecoin would repeat its fourth-year cyclical performance. At the same time, he said that the meme coin‚Äôs rise would be better compared to that of 2021. A MASSIVE rally is coming for $DOGE, MUCH bigger than the one in 2021. Are you prepared? pic.twitter.com/auBAw7XMMn ‚Äî CEO (@Investments_CEO) December 25, 2024 Meanwhile, some likely involvement from Elon Musk may be another crucial point, who is probably going to have a key role to play in the meme coin community sometime in the next year. His influence will probably create just the ideal atmosphere for Dogecoin to reach new highs. According to analyst Javon Marks, Dogecoin may surge as high as 600%, reaching approximately $2.28 based on past trends and market behavior. He says that previous cycles have followed similar patterns, leading to huge price increases. Market Sentiment And Future Outlook Despite recent volatility in the market and some bearish pressures, analysts still believe in Dogecoin‚Äôs bright future. The cryptocurrency market has recently been very volatile, and yet most of the analysts still predict that when bitcoin will stabilize and start surging again, Dogecoin will be sure to do the same. More than 140% gain of the Dogecoin‚Äôs price, taking the currency above $0.8023 is predicted once bitcoin reverses its down move.

Cardano, which has a market capitalization of $31.4 billion, and Ripple‚Äôs XRP, with a market capitalization of $123 billion, could be planning to enter into a symbiotic relationship. Cardano‚Äôs founder, Charles Hoskinson , has aroused discussions about adding XRP to Cardano‚Äôs privacy-focused Midnight sidechain. XRP in Cardano‚Äôs Midnight? Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, has hinted at the likelihood of partnering with Ripple. He suggested that the Midnight sidechain focused on privacy could include XRP in the project. The discussion also covered Ripple‚Äôs RLUSD stablecoin as a potential addition to Cardano‚Äôs ecosystem. Hoskinson also mentioned that he had been holding talks with Ripple CTO David Schwartz as well as the company‚Äôs CEO Brad Garlinghouse. ‚ÄúDave Schwartz is a great guy. He‚Äôs a brilliant guy. It‚Äôs a lot of fun being in meetings with him, and I love to hang out with him,‚Äù Hoskinson stated. Ripple‚Äôs resilience amid its legal battles with the U.S. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) impressed Hoskinson. The court case between Ripple and the SEC started in December 2020. Through XRP, the SEC alleged that Ripple sold securities without receiving prior approval. In July of 2023, the federal court ruled that XRP is not a security when traded in public platforms, among other things. However, unfavorable penalties and appeal proceedings continue to exert regulatory pressure on Ripple. In a recent live stream , Hoskinson even boasted about how well the company is run to deal with lawsuits, delistings, and regulation. Despite setbacks, Ripple remains a key player in the crypto space. Hoskinson also discussed using XRP in Midnight. This sidechain is built to focus on privacy within decentralized applications. He also mentioned that Ripple‚Äôs RLUSD stablecoin could work in many ways for Cardano‚Äôs ecosystem. Hoskinson‚Äôs Budding Relationship with Ripple The Cardano founder‚Äôs comments show a shift in his stance toward Ripple. He previously publicly apologized to the XRP community on November 10. Collaboration talks suggest Ripple and Cardano may align on privacy and smart contract innovations. Ripple remains a top crypto player. XRP is the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, with a $31.4 billion market cap as of Dec. 27 (CoinMarketCap). Despite legal challenges, Ripple continues to push forward with new initiatives. The discussions signal a potential alliance between Ripple and Cardano . This could create new opportunities in blockchain privacy and stablecoin integration if realized. Both sides remain in talks as they navigate the evolving crypto landscape.",Cryptocurrency|Featured|News|ADA|Cardano|Charles Hoskinson|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,ADA|MARKET|REGULATION|SPONSORED|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-27 22:34:38

Ethena (ENA) Eyes Breakout as Altcoin Season Approaches Ethena (ENA) is showing promising signs amid growing optimism for an upcoming altcoin season. Despite a recent dip of -12.95% over the past week, ENA has surged 48.75% in the last month and an impressive 83.34% over six months. The RSI stands at 28.24, indicating oversold conditions, while the stochastic at 6.97 suggests potential upward momentum. With the current price hovering between $0.81 and $1.29, breaking above the nearest resistance at $1.55 could open the path to the second resistance at $2.04. This move could represent a significant gain from current levels. The SMA for 10-days is below the 100-days SMA, hinting at a possible trend reversal. ENA might be poised for substantial growth. Movement (MOVE) Soars: Nearly 1000% Monthly Gain Signals Bullish Momentum Movement (MOVE) has soared nearly 1000% in the past month, showcasing strong bullish momentum. This week alone, the price surged over 72%. Trading between $0.57 and $1.11, MOVE is approaching its nearest resistance at $1.39. A break above this level could see it targeting $1.93, offering significant gains. The Relative Strength Index sits at 43, suggesting there's room for growth before hitting overbought levels. The Stochastic oscillator indicates oversold conditions, hinting at a potential price rebound. With the 100-day Simple Moving Average at $0.94, Movement appears poised for continued growth in the upcoming altcoin season. Conclusion SHIRO, ENA, and MOVE show promise but may have less short-term potential. Catzilla, the ultimate meme coin hero, offers a 700% ROI potential during its presale.

Emerging blockchain platforms are poised to revolutionize the market by the year 2025. This article explores the innovative technologies that are expected to drive the next significant surge in digital currencies. Delve into the developments that could reshape the future of crypto and potentially transform the global financial system. Graphite Token (@G): Powering the Blockchain That Could Topple Ethereum and Solana Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) have had their time in the spotlight. Now, Graphite Token (@G) is here, bringing with it the power of the Graphite L1 blockchain designed to make crypto simpler, faster, and more rewarding for everyone. Could this be the next big thing to follow Ethereum‚Äôs legendary 4,000X growth? The secret to life-changing crypto profits lies in spotting the next hidden gem before the crowd. History shows that early adopters of projects with real utility reap massive rewards: Solana started at $0.04 and skyrocketed to nearly $300 ‚Äî a staggering +7,500%. Ethereum launched below $1 and climbed to around $4,000 ‚Äî an insane +400,000%. The secret to their growth? Utility. The more people use them, the more valuable their tokens become. But times have changed, and these blockchains aren‚Äôt cutting it anymore. Discover SOL and ETH Challenger for 4,000X Profit Potential What‚Äôs Wrong with Ethereum and Solana? Older blockchains face growing challenges like rising fees, complexity, regulatory uncertainty, and questions about reliability. Take Solana, which occasionally experiences network outages, or Ethereum, which saw a significant reduction in its burn rate in 2024. Between unpredictable gas costs, unsatisfactory speed, and unreliable service, users are starting to look elsewhere. The dominance of the ‚Äúold guard‚Äù is fading. What Graphite Brings to the Table Graphite is built to address the challenges of older blockchains with a set of practical features. Direct Rewards for Entry-Point Nodes Graphite has something no other blockchain offers. It lets entry-point nodes earn 50% of transaction fees passing through their nodes, so literally anyone contributing to its operations can earn a share. Transparent, Trust-Based Interactions Graphite‚Äôs reputation-based system introduces a Trust Score, a measure of user credibility similar to a credit rating in TradFi. This approach enhances transparency while keeping user privacy within the network where interactions are built on trust. Fair Fees, Fast Speed, and High Scalability Powered by the PoA Polymer 2.0 Algorithm, Graphite keeps fees plain and as low as possible by minimizing computational and energy costs. The network processes up to 1,400 transactions per second with confirmation times under 10 seconds, delivering a perfect balance of speed, cost-efficiency, and reliability. Security as a Top Priority Graphite enforces a one user - one account policy to safeguard its network against fraud and scams. Additionally, it offers an optional KYC verification procedure with three tiers of off-chain checks powered by ZKP to ensure compliance while protecting user data. With transaction filters, users can choose to interact only with accounts that meet specific KYC levels, adding an extra layer of security. Is This Your Chance to Get in Early? The Graphite blockchain is secure, transparent, scalable, and cost-efficient, making it the go-to choice for developers and users alike. With its practical approach and early adoption potential, Graphite is a project worth watching. For those looking to get in early, Graphite offers an opportunity to be part of a blockchain that‚Äôs designed for long-term growth and usability. Will it deliver 4,000X gains? Time will tell, but the foundation is strong. This could be your shot at 4,000X profits ‚Äî Don‚Äôt miss out! ARB Token: Empowering Ethereum with Arbitrum's Layer-2 Scaling ARB is the token powering Arbitrum, a Layer-2 solution for Ethereum developed by Offchain Labs. Arbitrum enhances Ethereum by increasing transaction speed, scalability, and privacy. It uses optimistic rollups to improve smart contract performance and lower execution costs. ARB serves as a governance token, allowing holders to vote on network decisions and participate in ecosystem development. The initial supply is 10 billion tokens, with a maximum yearly inflation rate of 2%. Distribution includes allocations to investors, DAOs, individual wallets, a DAO Treasury, and the team and advisors. The Arbitrum DAO oversees any changes in token allocation. Solana (SOL): Exploring a Scalable Blockchain for Decentralized Apps Solana is a blockchain platform that focuses on scalability. It provides a foundation for decentralized applications, similar to Ethereum and Cardano. Solana stands out because of its architecture designed for fast transactions and flexible development across many programming languages. SOL is the native cryptocurrency of Solana. It plays a central role in the ecosystem. Users can use SOL to facilitate transactions, run custom programs, and reward network supporters. The SOL coin holds value because it underpins the operation of the Solana ecosystem. It rewards participants and allows access to various projects. Solana avoids sharding or second-layer solutions for scalability. Its high-capacity network aims to attract developers and investors by hosting high-activity products and services. AVAX: Avalanche's Eco-Friendly Blockchain with High Transaction Capacity AVAX is the native token of Avalanche, a Layer-1 blockchain known for its low fees and quick transaction processing. The platform uses a hybrid consensus mechanism that combines classical and Nakamoto principles, aiming to finalize transactions in less than two seconds. Avalanche features three interoperable chains‚Äîthe X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain‚Äîthat handle various functions like transactions and smart contracts. AVAX plays a central role in the ecosystem, used for transaction fees, securing the network through staking, and operating multiple Subnets. This utility supports payments, staking rewards, and the creation of custom tokens and blockchains within the network. Conclusion In conclusion, while coins like ARB, SOL, and AVAX show promise, they may have less potential in the short term. The Graphite Token (@G) powers the innovative Graphite L1 blockchain, aiming to simplify crypto and deliver unmatched speed and rewards. It tackles issues like Ethereum's high fees and Solana's network outages by offering fair transaction costs and a Trust Score system based on reputation. A unique reward model allows entry-point nodes to earn 50% of transaction fees, encouraging active participation. With strong security through Polymer 2.0 and optional KYC verification, Graphite sets new standards for blockchain reliability. For early adopters, it presents an exciting opportunity to engage with a project built for long-term growth. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

Winter Pepe (PEPEWINT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEWINT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Winter Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Winter Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Winter Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Winter Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Winter Pepe by entering its contract address ‚Äì CUreLFB9SJmu6WEpotjmLJgt1khhdpneukDRJsbXFCGM ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner.

In its 2024 Web3 Security Report, Hacken says that the theft of private crypto keys remains the most ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù threat to crypto investors. According to Hacken, the number of smart contract exploits pale in comparison to how often private crypto keys are stolen. ‚ÄúIn 2024, access control exploits ‚Äì closely tied to private key compromises ‚Äì accounted for nearly of total crypto hack losses, up from 50% in 2023. This translates to nearly lost across Web3, a sharp increase from less than $1 billion the previous year. 75% $1.7 billion In comparison, smart contract vulnerability exploits contributed just 14% of the total losses in 2024, underscoring the dominant threat posed by unauthorized access and private key theft.‚Äù Private keys are strings of letters, words, and numbers generated by crypto wallets used to authorize transactions and prove ownership. They help encrypt data and assets to protect them from being stolen. The cybersecurity firm goes on to note four reasons why people tend to get their private keys stolen ‚Äì using an insecure management platform, being tricked by social engineering campaigns, insecure backups of data, and vulnerabilities within single-signature schemes of crypto wallets. According to Hacken, the largest exploit of 2024 was the hack of centralized Indian crypto exchange WazirX, which saw over $230 million worth of digital assets stolen. ‚ÄúDespite employing a robust multiparty security system, the exchange suffered a breach due to unauthorized fund movements from their wallets. WazirX utilized a Gnosis Safe multisig wallet requiring 4 out of 6 signatures for transactions. Five of the keys were managed by WazirX, while the sixth was held by Liminal, a digital asset custody provider. The attacker managed to manipulate the system, obtaining signatures from three WazirX signers and one from Liminal, allowing them to upgrade the wallet to a malicious contract and siphon off the funds.‚Äù Don't Miss a Beat ‚Äì Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Egrar Crypto, a technical analyst whose X account is followed by nearly 70,000 fans people, emphasized that Ripple could deliver much higher gains than Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH) during this stage of the bull market. #XRP ‚Äì Will Outperform #ETH and #BTC ‚Äì The Secret Is Under the Hood! #XRP Market Cap Window = $619.61B ‚Äì $1.56T Ready How and Why. This post focuses on XRP's Dominance and its Market Cap potential, revealing why it has a much higher multiplier than both ETH and BTC.‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/7CbaGlPxjr ‚Äî EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 25, 2024 He first shared an assessment of how XRP‚Äôs dominance has been evolving lately, moving from as little as 1% to over 5% in the past four years, primarily as a result of the legal victory that Ripple had in its case against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). He went on to predict that a break above the 0.5 Fibonacci level ‚Äì typically interpreted as a bullish signal ‚Äì could propel XRP‚Äôs dominance to 11.44%. Given that the combined value of cryptocurrencies currently stands at $3.28 trillion, that would mean XRP‚Äôs market value could be propelled to $375 million on short notice if that scenario unfolds as Egrar Crypto expects. This would result in 3X gains for XRP holders based on the token‚Äôs current market cap. However, Egrar predicts that the total market cap of cryptos could surge to $5.42 trillion once alt-coin season starts, meaning that reaching the 11.44% dominance level would mean a total market cap of $620 billion or 5X gains for XRP investors. Although past performance is not a guarantee of future outcomes, the trend for XRP dominance is currently on an upward path. If its ascent continues, these are plausible targets that could be reached in the medium term. XRP at $4 Before Year End is a Real Possibility From a technical standpoint, the $4 area is a feasible target that XRP could reach once the market shakes off the latest pullback and late buyers enter the scene to add more fuel to the rally. The post-election uptick that the crypto market experienced is interpreted by analysts as the first wave in what could be a prolonged climb for digital assets as multiple tailwinds including Donald Trump‚Äôs victory in the November U.S. presidential election and the Federal Reserve‚Äôs commitment to keep lowering rates are favoring higher prices for risky assets like cryptos. XRP has been the most favored asset of this rally of all the top 10 cryptocurrencies as it experienced a 253% uptick since a court of law ruled in favor of the company in its long-standing legal rift against the SEC. The robustness of the XRP network and the active involvement of its C-level officers along with a strong community of die-hard backers who have accompanied the project despite the many challenges it has faced could make XRP become a powerhouse in the cross-border payments, decentralized finance (DeFi) , and smart contracts segments. The launch of the stablecoin RLUSD is a step forward for the project to keep expanding its reach. During the latest pullback, XRP has found support at around $1.95 per token. This is the most critical area to watch moving forward. As long as it holds, it could serve as a launching pad once alt-season kicks in. The short-term target of $4 seems attainable and this would result in XRP doubling its market cap. However, the target shared by Egrar Crypto provides a longer-term view of the potential of this cryptocurrency to keep expanding its footprint in the crypto market.

This widespread dip in altcoin prices is largely tied to Bitcoin's dominance (BTC.D), which currently sits at a high 58.1%. What is BTC.D and Why Does It Matter? Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) is the percentage of the total cryptocurrency market made up by Bitcoin. When BTC.D is high, it means most of the money in the market is flowing into Bitcoin rather than altcoins. This often happens during times of uncertainty, as investors see Bitcoin as a safer bet compared to smaller coins.For altcoins to thrive, BTC.D needs to go down. A lower BTC.D signals that investors are moving funds into smaller altcoins, which drives their prices up. Historically, BTC.D starts to drop in the first quarter of a new year. When this happens, it usually kicks off an ""altcoin season,"" where altcoins grow much faster than Bitcoin.That means altcoins such as $WIF, $BONK, $ETH, $SOL, and $SHIB will likely start moving to the upside significantly. However, to maximize gains, it‚Äôs essential to pick the highest winners. Among the most promising winners for the upcoming altcoin season, experts highlight Altura ($ALU) as a standout project. Why Altura ($ALU) Could Be the Star of Altcoin Season One of the most exciting projects to watch during the next altcoin season is Altura($ALU). Altura is an AI-driven cryptocurrency that‚Äôs focused on revolutionizing the NFT and gaming world. By using artificial intelligence, Altura offers cutting-edge solutions that are catching the attention of both crypto and tech enthusiasts.Currently, Altura is only at a $100 million market cap, making it an undervalued gem. A 10x growth would mean reaching just a $1 billion market cap, which is considered achievable given the rapid growth of the AI and gaming industries. These industries are expanding at an incredible pace, and Altura‚Äôs unique role in both sectors gives it a strong chance to succeed.What makes Altura special is not just its innovative approach but also its potential for massive returns. Experts predict it could deliver gains as high as 10x to 20x for early investors. While other coins may also rise during altcoin season, they might not provide the same explosive returns as Altura . Its focus on two of the fastest-growing industries‚ÄîAI and gaming‚Äîpositions it as a leader in the space. Final Thoughts The current struggles in the altcoin market are closely tied to Bitcoin's dominance. As long as BTC.D stays high, altcoins are likely to remain under pressure. However, history shows that this trend doesn‚Äôt last forever. Once BTC.D starts to decline, altcoin season can begin, creating exciting opportunities for smaller coins.For investors looking to maximize their returns, keeping an eye on promising projects like Altura ($ALU) is essential. With its strong use of AI and its position in the rapidly growing NFT and gaming sectors, Altura could lead the next wave of altcoin growth and deliver impressive returns in the coming months. Its low current market cap makes it a prime candidate for explosive gains, offering a rare opportunity in the crypto market. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Currently, the Bitcoin price is retesting the support line of an Ascending Channel after crashing below $95,000. A crypto analyst has predicted that if it can hold this key support level, it could stage a recovery and skyrocket to its next bullish target, aligning with the upper resistance line of the channel. Bitcoin Price Retest Support Line; New Target In Sight In a chart illustrating Bitcoin‚Äôs price movement within an Ascending Channel, Trader Tardigrade, a crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), revealed that the cryptocurrency has temporarily declined below the lower support line on the channel. The analyst labeled this decline a ‚ÄúFalse Break,‚Äù highlighting that the Ascending Channel remains intact despite the drop. Related Reading: Ethereum Total Value Locked Reaches Highest Level Since 2022 After Crossing $90 Billion, Will Price Follow? As indicated by the red circle in the price chart, the False Break suggests that Bitcoin‚Äôs brief move below the support level was short-lived and does not confirm the continuation of its previous downtrend. Trader Tardigrade noted that after Bitcoin‚Äôs False break, the cryptocurrency quickly moved back into the Ascending Channel to reclaim the lower support line. Interestingly, Bitcoin‚Äôs drop below the False break comes as the pioneer cryptocurrency experienced a sharp price crash below $95,000. Lately, the flagship cryptocurrency has been under significantly bearish pressure, recording notable declines as market volatility intensifies. Despite this bearish performance, Trader Tardigrade has disclosed that Bitcoin is now retesting the channel‚Äôs support line again, aiming to break above and trigger a price reversal. The analyst predicts that if Bitcoin can hold this support line, it will likely continue moving upwards within the channel. Consequently, the analyst has forecasted that Bitcoin‚Äôs next price target would be the upper resistance line of the Ascending Channel. Looking at the price chart, the channel points upwards towards a range between $110,000 and $112,000. If Bitcoin can successfully recover toward the upper resistance line, it could signal the continuation of a bullish trend within the Ascending Channel. Additionally, a breakout above the resistance line could further validate the bullish momentum, setting up a stage for Bitcoin to potentially target higher price levels and possibly retest its all-time high. Related Reading: Here Are The Major Bitcoin Support Levels To Watch As Bulls Push For $100,000 Again Analyst Says Bitcoin Could Crash To $87,000 Bitcoin is currently in a downward trend, experiencing severe price declines despite analysts‚Äô optimistic projections of a price surge. According to crypto analyst Titan of Crypto, the Bitcoin price could see another decline, with the support level at $87,000 being the next target. However, according to the analyst, a drop to this price low could bring ‚Äúmaximum pain‚Äù to both short‚Äîand long-term investors. Nevertheless, Titan of Crypto believes this severe price decline could also present a strong foundation for Bitcoin‚Äôs next price rally. He emphasized that price movements are rarely linear, highlighting the crypto market‚Äôs inherent unpredictability and volatility. Despite Bitcoin‚Äôs bearish behavior, Titan of Crypto confidently predicts that a price rally to $110,000 is inevitable.

Cardano Price Outlook & Dogecoin Whale Activity Soar,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdags-whitepaper-v3-reveals-tech-progress-cardano-price-outlook-dogecoin-whale-activity-soar/,"As the altcoin sector braces for an expected $2.5 trillion surge, giants like Cardano, Dogecoin, and BlockDAG (BDAG) are picking up steam. The Cardano price outlook is attracting attention with a surge in whale activity as hefty investors scoop up 160 million ADA tokens following its recent slip to $0.91. In tandem, Dogecoin whales are tactically maneuvering through critical support levels, eyeing the $0.684 mark. On the other hand, BlockDAG, fresh off the release of its Whitepaper V3, continues to draw in crypto whales eager for the next blockbuster financial opportunity. The whitepaper sheds light on significant updates and strategic plans for BlockDAG‚Äôs tech through 2025. What‚Äôs more, this utility-centric project is causing a splash in the presale market, having raised over $173 million across 26 batches, rapidly closing in on its ambitious $600 million target. Cardano Price Outlook: Will It Breach $1 & Hit $2.27? The buzz around Cardano price outlook is growing as major investors accumulate 160 million ADA tokens post its dip to $0.91. After a 6% recovery, ADA now trades at $0.95, with forecasts suggesting it could rise to $1.2 soon if it surpasses the critical $1 mark. Looking further ahead, the long-term outlook sets a $2.27 target, making the $1 level crucial for upward momentum. Yet, the road to recovery for Cardano price outlook is not without its bumps. The drop in daily active users by 58% poses questions about lasting engagement. Furthermore, there are worries about its resilience in holding the $0.90 support amid market ups and downs. Can Dogecoin Whale Activity Push to $0.415? A recent update from @CryptoMichNL on platform X underscored that the ‚ÄúAltcoin market capitalization has beautifully retested and is set to climb to $2.5T.‚Äù This statement underscores the heightened activity across altcoins, notably Dogecoin, which continues to captivate due to significant whale movements. Currently at $0.348, Dogecoin Whale movements have maintained the essential $0.264 support level, targeting $0.415 and $0.684. While such whales frequently ignite price hikes, their influence brings about concerns regarding market equilibrium. Observers note that Dogecoin‚Äôs limited utility detracts from its competitiveness, and its volatile price trends cause hesitation among investors, highlighting the need for more robust fundamentals to sustain long-term growth. BlockDAG‚Äôs Whitepaper V3: Tackling Crypto‚Äôs Scalability & Privacy Issues The anticipated altcoin boom, projected to push the market to a staggering $2.5 trillion, has all eyes on ventures ready to lead this explosive growth. At the forefront is BlockDAG, a cutting-edge blockchain platform reshaping the crypto landscape. Having already amassed over $173 million by offloading more than 17.5 billion BDAG coins, BlockDAG has outstripped all expectations. Early backers have witnessed an incredible 2,240% growth in their holdings, as the price of BDAG coins skyrocketed from an initial $0.001 to $0.0234 in the current batch. BlockDAG‚Äôs recently launched Whitepaper V3 has enthralled both developers and whales, unveiling advanced solutions that tackle scalability, privacy, and compatibility challenges. It seamlessly integrates the UTXO model for private transactions and the account-based model for Ethereum-compatible smart contracts, creating an ideal platform for DeFi, dApps, and NFTs. The document also introduces the Phantom GhostDAG protocol, pioneering a partially ordered transaction system that slashes fees while safeguarding transaction integrity, setting a new efficiency standard in the blockchain arena. This innovation is igniting a flurry of interest among crypto enthusiasts, fueling a swift uptick in presale holdings. Market experts now believe BlockDAG could hit its $600 million presale goal sooner than anticipated. With BDAG coins in high demand, the ongoing presale batch is nearing completion, poised to trigger a sharp price rise in the subsequent phase. For those eyeing the best crypto project , the time to dive in is now, before the opportunity dwindles and prices spike. What is the Best Crypto Project? The altcoin arena is abuzz, with the Cardano price outlook hinting at renewed whale accumulations, and Dogecoin whale activity solidifying key supports. Yet, the spotlight is increasingly on BlockDAG, which is setting new standards with its latest Whitepaper V3 and impressive presale achievements. Having already surpassed the $173 million mark, BlockDAG is quickly nearing its $600 million goal. For those still pondering the next big crypto project, BlockDAG is emerging as a standout contender, offering unparalleled growth potential.

Trump Cyborg (TRUMPCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCYB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Cyborg launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Cyborg on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Cyborg by entering its contract address ‚Äì 9yaNQ89EaQ2nEDczZpuTZfDwfiYCxbwSYC4JeiWLDE57 ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCYB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-28 00:07:43

Sounds like a dream portfolio, doesn‚Äôt it? In the fast-paced crypto world, where fortunes can be made overnight, three names stand out: BTFD Coin (BTFD), Ponke (PONKE), and COQ Inu (COQ). Each is blazing a unique trail in the meme coin landscape. BTFD Coin has captivated investors with its massive presale success, Ponke is breaking boundaries with decentralised utility, and COQ Inu is charting new territory with cutting-edge interoperability. Here‚Äôs why these projects are the top new meme coins with 1000X potential. BTFD Coin: A Festive Presale Like No Other Let‚Äôs start with the hottest meme coin on the block‚Äîthe BTFD Coin. Imagine an investment that not only promises massive returns but also rewards you with a 50% bonus just for getting in early. In Stage 13 of its presale, BTFD is priced at $0.000142 per coin, and with the BIG50 code, investors can maximise their holdings. This isn‚Äôt just a coin; it‚Äôs a movement. ‚Äú Buy The Dip ‚Äù isn‚Äôt just a slogan‚Äîit‚Äôs a strategy. The project is built on the principle that dips are opportunities, not setbacks. It‚Äôs no wonder BTFD has already raised over $4.6 million, sold 60 billion coins, and attracted 6,900+ enthusiastic holders. The coin‚Äôs Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, now in beta, is adding another layer of excitement. While rewards aren‚Äôt live yet, the gameplay is drawing attention from both gamers and investors. Add to this a staking system offering 90% APY and a referral programme that‚Äôs turning the community into a marketing powerhouse, and it‚Äôs clear BTFD is here to stay. To paint a picture, investing $5,000 at the current presale price would get you 35.2 million BTFD coins. With the BIG50 bonus, that jumps to 52.8 million. When the coin lists at $0.0006, your investment could balloon to $31,680. Joining is simple. Visit the BTFD Presale Page , connect your wallet, don‚Äôt forget to apply the BIG50 code for 50% extra BTFD Coins, and secure your investment before January 5, 2025. Act fast! Ponke: Utility That Sets It Apart Ponke is more than just another meme coin. With the launch of PonkeSwap, a decentralised exchange, it‚Äôs proving that meme coins can offer real-world utility. This move positions Ponke as a serious contender in the crypto space, appealing to both meme enthusiasts and utility-focused investors. Despite its innovative strides, Ponke has faced its share of challenges. After its Binance Futures listing, the coin experienced a short-lived surge, climbing from $0.44 to $0.55, only to settle at its current price of $0.32. While the volatility might deter some, it also presents an opportunity for those who believe in Ponke‚Äôs long-term vision. Ponke‚Äôs ability to adapt and innovate, particularly in the decentralised finance (DeFi) space, makes it a coin to watch. Its commitment to blending entertainment and functionality sets it apart in a crowded market. COQ Inu: Innovation Through Interoperability COQ Inu is rewriting the playbook for meme coins by integrating Chainlink‚Äôs Cross-Chain Token Standard. This technological leap allows COQ to operate seamlessly across multiple blockchains, making it more accessible and versatile than many of its competitors. Currently priced at $0.00000157, COQ Inu has seen a 15.74% price dip over the past week. While this might raise eyebrows, it‚Äôs important to remember that innovation often comes with growing pains. COQ‚Äôs focus on technological advancement positions it as a long-term player in the meme coin space. By addressing the interoperability challenge, COQ Inu is not just riding the meme coin wave‚Äîit‚Äôs leading it. Investors who value cutting-edge solutions in the crypto space will find COQ Inu‚Äôs approach both refreshing and promising. Turning Dips Into Opportunities The 1973 stock market crash taught us an invaluable lesson: downturns aren‚Äôt failures; they‚Äôre opportunities. Smart investors turned that chaos into immense wealth by buying undervalued assets. BTFD Coin embodies this ethos, offering a chance to invest before the next bull run. By focusing on presale opportunities, BTFD allows investors to get in early, maximise their returns, and ride the wave of its innovative ecosystem. Conclusion If you‚Äôre looking for the top new meme coins with 1000X potential , BTFD Coin is the standout choice based on current trends. Its limited-time 50% bonus, thriving presale, and innovative features make it a must-have for forward-thinking investors. While Ponke and COQ Inu bring their unique strengths to the table, it‚Äôs BTFD‚Äôs momentum and ROI potential that truly shine. Don‚Äôt miss your chance to be part of this revolution.

The Bitget Token ( BGB ) is trading at $7.37 at time of writing and is up nearly 28% in the past 24 hours and more than 70% in the past week. BGB‚Äôs gains partially materialized amid news that Bitget plans to merge the token with its other native asset, the Bitget Wallet Token ( BWB ). BWB, the 638th-ranked crypto asset by market cap, is down more than 4% in the past day but up nearly 45% in the past week. Bitget‚Äôs merger will unify both tokens under the BGB label. The exchange says the decision was driven by community demand. Explains Bitget chief executive Gracy Chen, ‚ÄúBy merging BGB and BWB, we are taking a major step toward building a unified and robust ecosystem that bridges on-chain and off-chain applications. This move will enhance the utility of BGB, and ensure that every holder benefits from Bitget ecosystem growth.‚Äù Bitget says BWB holders on the exchange can automatically swap their BWB to BGB at a 0.08563 ratio, which the firm says was calculated using a 7-day average closing price of the BWB/USDT pair on Bitget. BGB is currently the 22nd-ranked crypto asset by market cap. The overall crypto market cap dropped by 4.7% on Thursday, according to CoinGecko.

As we approach 2025, investors and enthusiasts are keen to identify which cryptocurrencies will lead the charge. Here‚Äôs a curated list of the top five cryptocurrencies expected to make a substantial impact: 1. Qubetics ($TICS) Qubetics is making waves by integrating decentralised Virtual Private Networks (dVPNs) into its ecosystem. This addition enhances user privacy and supports various decentralised services, including DeFi, NFTs, and decentralised storage. Qubetics dVPN upholds the core principles of autonomy and decentralisation central to Web3 by ensuring secure and private connections.Currently, in Presale Phase 14, Qubetics offers a compelling opportunity for early investors. With TICS tokens priced at $0.037, the project has already raised over $7.9 million, attracted more than 12,100 holders, and sold 379 million tokens. The presale structure includes weekly phases with a 10% price hike, culminating in a 20% increase in the final stage. Analysts project a post-presale target of $0.25 per token, indicating a potential ROI of 563.81% for early adopters. Forecasts suggest that Qubetics could reach $10 to $15 after the mainnet launch, underscoring its potential as a top cryptocurrency to watch in 2025 . 2. Bitcoin (BTC) As the pioneer of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin continues to dominate the market. In 2024, Bitcoin experienced significant gains, surpassing $100,000 due to interest in spot Bitcoin ETFs, a supply-reducing halving event, and expectations of pro-crypto policies following political developments. Analysts maintain a largely positive outlook for Bitcoin through 2025, with varying predictions. Bitwise forecasts Bitcoin could attain $200,000 and potentially $500,000 if the U.S. government adopts a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Standard Chartered shares a positive outlook, while VanEck projects Bitcoin reaching $180,000 amidst significant volatility. 3. Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink‚Äôs decentralised oracle network is a cornerstone in the blockchain ecosystem, providing reliable real-world data to smart contracts. Its effectiveness in integrating off-chain data with on-chain applications has led to widespread adoption across various sectors. As blockchain technology continues to permeate different industries, Chainlink's role becomes increasingly vital, positioning it as a promising investment for those looking toward 2025. 4. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum remains at the forefront of decentralised applications and smart contract platforms. The anticipated full deployment of Ethereum 2.0 aims to address scalability issues, potentially leading to higher transaction speeds and lower gas fees. This evolution could further solidify Ethereum's position as a leading platform for DeFi, NFTs, and other blockchain-based applications. Analysts project that Ethereum could trade in a wide range, with a minimum price of $2,670 and a maximum of $5,990 by 2025, depending on market momentum. 5. VeChain (VET) VeChain focuses on enhancing supply chain efficiency and sustainability through its innovative use of decentralised technology. VeChain enables businesses to streamline operations and build consumer trust by providing transparent and tamper-proof data on products and services. As global supply chains become increasingly complex, VeChain's solutions are well-positioned to address these challenges, making it a cryptocurrency to watch in the coming years. Conclusion The cryptocurrency market is poised for significant developments as we approach 2025. Projects like Qubetics , with its innovative dVPN integration and established players like Bitcoin, Chainlink, Ethereum, and VeChain, offer diverse opportunities for investors and technology enthusiasts alike. Staying informed and conducting thorough research are essential steps for anyone looking to navigate this dynamic landscape and capitalise on the potential growth of these digital assets.

Says Oppenheimer banking analyst Chris Kotowski, ‚ÄúOnce you get much below the biggest banks, then it does become really hard to make the necessary investments and have the same name recognition‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre a very mobile society, especially since Covid. Lots of people that move from New York to Florida for example, do you really need to have a different bank in Florida than you do in New York?‚Äù The consolidation of power by the biggest US banks highlights the struggle of smaller institutions to deal with regulation, volatile interest rates and the ability of larger banks to spread their presence digitally across the country.

Prince Elon launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Prince Elon on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Prince Elon by entering its contract address ‚Äì 7rAsmWGTtPFY9RFnhd9biard7PrWtw5ZigowwfmaXUQ ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONPRIN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-28 01:27:00

Dogecoin Has Seen Positive Signals On TD Sequential & Whale Supply In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a Tom Demark (TD) Sequential signal that Dogecoin has just witnessed on its 4-hour price chart. The ‚ÄúTD Sequential‚Äù refers to a technical analysis indicator that‚Äôs used for locating points of probable reversal for any asset‚Äôs price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Tokens Have Only Been Getting Older This Bull Run, Analyst Reveals The indicator includes two phases, called the setup and countdown. During the first of these, the setup, candles in the price of the same color are counted up to nine. These candles aren‚Äôt necessary to be consecutive. When the nine candles are in, the setup is said to be finished, and the TD Sequential gives a reversal signal for the asset. Naturally, if the candles involved in the setup‚Äôs completion were green, the indicator would suggest a top, and if they were red, the signal would be for a bottom. As soon as the setup is over, the countdown phase begins. This phase of the TD Sequential works exactly the same as the setup, except for the fact that it involves thirteen candles, not nine. Once these candles have also been printed, the indicator gives another buy or sell signal for the price. Recently, Dogecoin has finished the first of these TD Sequential phases. Here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows this signal in DOGE‚Äôs 4-hour price: As is visible in the above graph, the Dogecoin 4-hour price has completed the TD Sequential setup with nine green candles, which implies the coin may now be set for a turnaround to the upside. This isn‚Äôt the only positive signal that DOGE has observed recently, as Martinez has pointed out in another X post¬†that the whales have been busy purchasing during the last couple of days. The on-chain indicator cited by the analyst is the Supply Distribution from the analytics firm Santiment, which tells us about the amount of supply that any particular wallet group is holding right now. Below is the chart for the metric that specifically shows the data for the whale cohort, massive investors carrying between 10 million and 100 million tokens: From the graph, it‚Äôs apparent that the Dogecoin supply held by the whales has registered an increase recently. More specifically, the whales have added a net amount of 90 million DOGE (worth around $28.7 million) to their holdings in the last two days. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Bull Run Over?

In an interview with Anthony Pompliano, he pointed out that while the SEC was targeting Ripple, other high-profile figures like Sam Bankman-Fried were involved in serious financial misconduct without facing similar regulatory pressure. Gasparino argued that this was an example of regulatory overreach.

Gasparino explained that his interest in Ripple began years earlier when he covered Ethereum‚Äôs efforts to establish its own regulatory framework, which led to a viral reaction after a clip of his reporting was shared by a Ripple supporter.

Top Crypto to Buy Now Amid Solana‚Äôs $776M Inflows and Ethereum Whale Moves What if you could secure your financial future by investing in the right crypto at the right time? With blockchain technology rapidly redefining our digital interactions, picking the top cryptos to buy and hold for the long term has never been more crucial. The latest updates on Ethereum and Solana are stirring the crypto market, but the buzz around Qubetics ($TICS) is stealing the spotlight. While Ethereum faces market tremors from whale activity and Solana demonstrates its robust market recovery, Qubetics‚Äô presale generates unmatched excitement. This article will explore the developments of Qubetics, Solana, and Ethereum, helping you decide which crypto is the most promising to buy and hold for the long term. Qubetics: Transforming Web3 Privacy with dVPN In a world where digital privacy is constantly threatened, Qubetics ($TICS) is rewriting the rules. As part of its expansive Web3 infrastructure, Qubetics offers a decentralised VPN (dVPN) service. Unlike traditional VPN providers, which often track and control user data, the Qubetics dVPN relies on a peer-to-peer, blockchain-powered network. This decentralisation means no single entity can manipulate or monitor your online activity, ensuring true privacy and resistance to censorship. What makes this even more compelling is how it incentivises participation. Users who share bandwidth are rewarded with TICS tokens, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem. Enhanced security features, such as multi-hop routing and end-to-end encryption, bolster anonymity and protect sensitive data. This innovation makes Qubetics a standout among the top cryptos to buy and hold for the long term. Qubetics recently hosted an engaging AMA session, providing insights into their vision and addressing community questions. This transparent approach reinforces its commitment to building trust and fostering a loyal investor base. Solana: A Marriage of Innovation and Controversy Solana has made headlines for reasons beyond its technological advancements. Co-founder Stephen Akridge, embroiled in a legal dispute, faces allegations of withholding yield generated by Solana tokens during a divorce settlement. Despite this drama, Solana‚Äôs performance speaks volumes. With $776 million in daily inflows, the blockchain is cementing its reputation as a reliable platform for developers and investors alike. Boasting faster transactions and lower costs, Solana continues to attract attention as a leading competitor in the crypto space. It‚Äôs a testament to its potential for long-term growth, even amidst personal controversies. Ethereum: Whale Activity Sparks Investor Curiosity Ethereum, one of the most established blockchains, recently experienced significant activity. An ICO whale, known for strategic profit-taking, transferred 4,160 ETH‚Äîworth approximately $14.5 million‚Äîto Kraken. This move has raised concerns about potential selling pressure, which could lead to short-term price fluctuations. Historically, this whale has timed exits during market peaks, as seen with a $10.1 million sale earlier this month. Such activity fuels speculation about Ethereum‚Äôs immediate market trends. However, its long-term value remains undisputed, making it a staple in any portfolio. The Qubetics Presale: A Gateway to Early-Stage Gains The Qubetics presale is where the excitement truly builds. Currently, in Phase 14, $TICS tokens are priced at $0.037. With over $7.9 million raised, 12,100+ holders, and 379 million tokens sold, this presale has already captured significant attention. Investors are flocking to secure their share, knowing that each phase brings a 10% price increase, culminating in a 20% surge in the final stage. Missing out now could mean paying more later, making it one of the top cryptos to buy and hold for the long term. The momentum surrounding Qubetics is growing daily, driven by its unique use cases and token economics. Early investors gain financially and position themselves at the forefront of blockchain innovation. Will you be one of them? Conclusion: Which Crypto Should You Back? The crypto market is alive with opportunities, and each coin‚ÄîEthereum, Solana, and Qubetics ($TICS)‚Äîoffers unique advantages. Ethereum‚Äôs proven history, Solana‚Äôs technological prowess, and Qubetics‚Äô innovative dVPN service collectively highlight why these are the top cryptos to buy and hold long-term.

As part of its expansive ecosystem, Qubetics introduces a decentralised VPN (dVPN) service that aims to redefine internet privacy and security. Unlike traditional VPNs, which often centralise user data and risk breaches, the Qubetics dVPN leverages blockchain to decentralise operations. But what does this mean for users? The Qubetics dVPN ensures that no central authority controls user traffic, eliminating censorship and enhancing privacy. Its peer-to-peer network provides unmatched transparency and rewards users who share bandwidth with $TICS tokens. Imagine an internet where your privacy is protected, your data is encrypted, and you‚Äôre incentivised to participate. Could this be the future of secure browsing? Additionally, Qubetics has been fostering a stronger connection with its community by hosting an engaging AMA session . These sessions provide clarity, insights, and a sneak peek into their ambitious roadmap. With innovations like these, Qubetics is swiftly positioning itself as a top crypto to invest in. Bitwise Eyes New Horizons with Bitcoin ETF Bitcoin continues to lead the charge in crypto innovation. Bitwise Asset Management has recently filed for a new exchange-traded fund (ETF) aimed at companies holding substantial Bitcoin reserves. The proposed Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF will invest in publicly traded firms with at least 1,000 BTC in their treasuries. This initiative, detailed in a filing submitted on 26 December, includes rigorous criteria for companies to qualify, ensuring transparency and stability. By prioritising firms with significant Bitcoin holdings, the ETF aims to provide exposure to Bitcoin‚Äôs value while diversifying risks. This development underscores Bitcoin‚Äôs enduring role as a pillar of the crypto ecosystem. Arweave: A New Chapter in Decentralised Storage Arweave, the blockchain designed for permanent data storage, continues to make waves with its innovative use cases. Offering a decentralised solution to data archiving, Arweave ensures information is accessible and tamper-proof forever. Its unique permaweb structure increasingly appeals to developers and organisations seeking reliable and secure storage. This commitment to advancing storage technology positions Arweave as a noteworthy contender in the blockchain sector. As enterprises and projects increasingly demand decentralised solutions, Arweave‚Äôs relevance and utility only grow stronger. Qubetics Presale: Don‚Äôt Miss the Next Big Leap The excitement surrounding Qubetics‚Äô presale is palpable. Currently, in Phase 14, the presale is structured to reward early adopters with significant price gains. Each phase introduces a 10% price increase, culminating in a 20% jump in the final stage. At present, $TICS tokens are priced at $0.037, with over $7.9 million already raised. This dynamic pricing model reflects the project‚Äôs growing demand and incentivises investors to act quickly. As one of the top cryptos to invest in , Qubetics offers a rare opportunity to get in early on a project with immense potential. If you want to combine innovation, community, and investment growth, Qubetics might just be the game-changer you‚Äôre waiting for. Conclusion: A Bright Future for Crypto Investors The latest developments across Qubetics, Bitcoin, and Arweave demonstrate the immense innovation within the cryptocurrency world. Analysts predict exciting trajectories for all three projects, with each catering to unique market needs. However, the standout opportunity lies with Qubetics ($TICS). Its decentralised VPN service, robust community engagement, and thrilling presale make it one of the top cryptos to invest in today.

Instead, the market is moving sideways, hinting at a period of consolidation within an overall uptrend. At the time of writing, XRP is down by more than two percent and is trading at $2.17. Uptrend Still in Play Despite the current consolidation, the overall trend for XRP is still bullish. The price action looks like a temporary pullback, rather than the start of a downtrend. If the price continues to move upward, it could challenge its all-time high of around $3.25 to $3.30, which also aligns with a critical Fibonacci level. Holding Above the 2021 High A key point to note is that XRP is holding above its 2021 high of $1.96. This is a strong signal of market strength. Maintaining this level is crucial for XRP‚Äôs continued positive momentum, and as long as the price stays above this, the market outlook remains favorable. Short-Term Market Behavior: Triangle Formation On the shorter time frame, XRP is currently forming a triangle pattern. While triangle patterns can lead to breakouts in either direction, they are fragile and tend to be less reliable. As a result, there is a possibility of short-term bearish action, but the price could also break to the upside. Key Levels for Risk Management For traders, it‚Äôs important to monitor the key support and resistance levels within this triangle. The price must hold above the $1.95 support level to maintain the triangle pattern. If it falls below this point, the likelihood of a bearish move increases, and the triangle scenario may be invalidated. The $1.95 level is the key support for XRP and if the price stays above this, the consolidation pattern is likely to continue. However, if the price drops below this level, we could see a more significant pullback, with the next support areas being around $1.80 to $1.39.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-28 02:31:34

Winter Pepe (PEPEWINT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEWINT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Winter Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Winter Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Winter Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Winter Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Winter Pepe by entering its contract address ‚Äì CUreLFB9SJmu6WEpotjmLJgt1khhdpneukDRJsbXFCGM ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEWINT.

Lightchain AI, currently in its presale phase at just $0.003, is attracting significant attention for its innovative use of artificial intelligence in blockchain. Positioned as a promising project, its unique features and tokenomics set it apart from other tokens in the space. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu continues to maintain its place as one of the most recognized meme coins, with ongoing developments aimed at expanding its ecosystem. Both tokens offer intriguing opportunities for investors looking to capitalize on the next wave of crypto market growth. In this article, we‚Äôll take a closer look at the potential of these two altcoins and why they are worth keeping an eye on. Lightchain AI: Redefining Blockchain with Artificial Intelligence Lightchain AI is changing the blockchain world by smoothly combining smart machines with blockcÕèhain tech. As a fresh idea, it offers special traits that boost growth, safety, and speed, giving a new type of blockchain answer. With its smart machine-led method Lightchain AI can make tasks automatic improve deal times and fine-tune network work. Right now in its early sale phase at $0.003, it shows a good chance for first buyers to join in a project that mixes two of the most changing technologies. The money system and plan of Lightchain AI also show its power to make a strong mark in the crypto area. Shiba Inu: Riding the Meme Coin Wave with Continued Developments Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a meme coin that has been making waves in the cryptocurrency community since its launch in 2020. As a decentralized cryptocurrency, SHIB operates on the Ethereum blockchain and presents a fun and tongue-in-cheek approach to crypto investing. Despite its playful nature, SHIB has maintained strong support from its dedicated community and has recently made headlines with new developments aimed at expanding its ecosystem. This includes plans for decentralized exchange listings, integration with online gaming platforms, and partnerships with major companies such as Amazon. With these exciting developments on the horizon, SHIB continues to show potential for long-term growth. In addition, SHIB has also shown resilience during periods of market volatility. While other altcoins may experience significant dips in value, SHIB has managed to maintain a relatively stable price range. This makes it an attractive option for investors looking for a more secure and less volatile alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Which Altcoin Should You Watch? When deciding which altcoin to watch, two standout options in the current market are Lightchain AI and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Lightchain AI, with its innovative blend of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology, is gaining significant attention. Currently in its presale phase at $0.003, it offers investors an early entry into a promising project focused on improving scalability and security through AI-driven solutions. With a solid roadmap and unique tokenomics, Lightchain AI stands out as a long-term investment opportunity. On the other hand, Shiba Inu continues to be a dominant force in the meme coin space, with a growing ecosystem and increasing community engagement. While Lightchain AI offers a tech-driven approach, Shiba Inu remains a popular choice for those looking to invest in a recognized and growing community. But lightchain AI is more potential and more opportunities to grow.",Press Release,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|SHIB,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-28 03:00:00

This is evident in Bitcoin reserves on spot exchanges, which had been in a steady decline for weeks, now seeing a notable uptick with an inflow exceeding 20,000 BTC, according to CryptoQuant analyst IT Tech. Simultaneously, netflows across all exchanges turned positive, registering an increase of 15,800 BTC. These shifts mark a reversal from the consistent outflow trend observed in previous weeks, suggesting that traders may be preparing for increased activity on exchanges. Related Reading: Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Giving Potential Buy Signal, Quant Says Detailing The Increasing Exchange Reserves and Positive Netflows When Bitcoin reserves rise on exchanges, it typically signals an intent to trade or sell, introducing the possibility of selling pressure. Similarly, positive net flows indicate that the volume of Bitcoin moving onto exchanges is outpacing the volume being withdrawn. Historically, such patterns have often been associated with periods of increased market volatility. While the long-term accumulation trend remains intact, these new inflows highlight a short-term shift in sentiment, suggesting that investors may be positioning themselves for profit-taking or preparing for potential price corrections. IT Tech wrote: If reserves and netflows continue to rise, we could see increased volatility and potential downward pressure on Bitcoin‚Äôs price in the near term. This reversal highlights the importance of monitoring exchange activity for early signs of changing market sentiment. Another Bitcoin Metric Signalling Growing Buying Pressure While there have been signs of looming price action, another CryptoQuant analyst Burak Kesmeci has highlighted an opposite key observation: Bitcoin Taker Buy Volume on Binance has surged to $8.3 billion. This metric tracks the total volume of buy transactions executed by ‚Äútakers‚Äù on Binance‚Äîmarket participants who purchase BTC at current market prices using existing liquidity. An increase in Taker Buy Volume is generally interpreted as a sign of heightened investor interest and growing buying pressure.

Just last month, Bonk caught everyone‚Äôs eye with its explosive surge, but it seems there‚Äôs a new player in town that‚Äôs stealing the show. BTFD Coin (BTFD), with its presale performance skyrocketing past $4.6 million and growing, is breaking records like it‚Äôs smashing pi√±atas. If you thought meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu had their moment, think again. BTFD Coin is proving that the best meme coins with 1000X potential aren‚Äôt a thing of the past‚Äîthey‚Äôre just getting started. Over the years, meme coins have gone from a joke to some of the most lucrative investments in the crypto world. They‚Äôve built communities, inspired memes, and, yes, created millionaires overnight. But here‚Äôs the kicker: BTFD Coin isn‚Äôt just another meme coin riding the hype wave. It‚Äôs shaking things up with a killer play-to-earn (P2E) game , a robust referral programme, juicy staking rewards, and a tight-knit community that‚Äôs growing faster than you can say ‚ÄúHODL.‚Äù It‚Äôs not just riding the meme coin trend; it‚Äôs redefining it. So, what‚Äôs the scoop on Bonk and BTFD Coin? Why is BTFD dominating headlines, and what makes it the hottest presale of the year? Let‚Äôs dive into this ultimate showdown of the best meme coins with 1000X potential and find out why BTFD Coin‚Äôs presale is your golden ticket to the next crypto bull run. Bonk: The Viral Star That Keeps People Talking When Bonk burst onto the scene, it felt like the early days of Dogecoin all over again. As the first Solana-based meme coin to go mainstream, Bonk gained traction thanks to its loyal community and unique decentralised approach. It was fun, quirky, and completely on-brand for what people expect from meme coins. Its interactive ‚Äúpop-to-click‚Äù feature drew thousands to its ecosystem, making it a viral sensation practically overnight. But here‚Äôs the thing‚Äîas fun as Bonk is, its utility is limited. It‚Äôs like a firework show that dazzles the crowd but fades fast. After peaking at $2 earlier this year, it‚Äôs now trading at around $0.7, a sharp reminder of how volatile these coins can be. Analysts predict that Bonk could recover if Bitcoin rallies, potentially reaching $3 or $4 next year. But without significant updates or additional use cases, it‚Äôs walking a tightrope. Despite its shortcomings, Bonk still holds a spot in the hearts of meme coin enthusiasts. It‚Äôs nostalgic and taps into that community-driven ethos that made Dogecoin a legend. However, when you‚Äôve got a coin like BTFD that‚Äôs smashing presale records, Bonk starts to look a little like yesterday‚Äôs news. Could Bonk reinvent itself and climb back up the charts? Sure. But for now, it‚Äôs more of a gamble than a strategic play. BTFD Coin: The New King of Meme Coins If Bonk is the cool kid everyone wants to be friends with, BTFD Coin is the overachiever breaking every record in the book. BTFD Coin has raised over $4.6 million in its presale, with 60 billion coins sold and 6,900 holders already in the mix. That‚Äôs not just impressive; it‚Äôs jaw-dropping. And the cherry on top? You can unlock 50% extra coins using the code BIG50. Seriously, who does that? But let‚Äôs not stop at the numbers. BTFD Coin has real utility, something that sets it apart from the pack. Its P2E game isn‚Äôt just a gimmick; it‚Äôs a full-blown ecosystem where players can earn while having a blast. The referral programme sweetens the deal, giving users a reason to spread the word and grow the community. Add staking rewards into the mix, and you‚Äôve got a meme coin that‚Äôs not just for laughs but for long-term gains. Let‚Äôs break it down with an example. Imagine you‚Äôve got $25,000 burning a hole in your pocket. At Stage 13, with a price of $0.000142 per BTFD Coin, you‚Äôd snag 176,056,338 coins. Now, hold onto your hat: when the presale price hits $0.0006, your investment will balloon to $105,633. Yeah, you read that right. That‚Äôs more than four times your initial investment. Talk about a glow-up. And we haven‚Äôt even talked about the community yet. BTFD‚Äôs following is growing faster than a TikTok trend, with over 6,900 bulls rallying behind it. This isn‚Äôt just hype; it‚Äôs a movement. Analysts are already predicting that BTFD could become the poster child for the next crypto bull run, and honestly, it‚Äôs hard to argue with that. Why BTFD Coin Is the Smart Play Right Now When you stack BTFD Coin against Bonk, it‚Äôs like comparing a Tesla to a tricycle. Bonk has its charm, sure, but BTFD is the complete package. It‚Äôs got utility, it‚Äôs got community, and most importantly, it‚Äôs got potential. The best meme coins with 1000X potential aren‚Äôt just about riding a wave; they‚Äôre about building something that lasts. And that‚Äôs exactly what BTFD Coin is doing. With its presale already past $4.6 million and a total of 16 stages, the opportunities here are as juicy as a summer barbecue. The BIG50 code gives you 50% extra coins, making this one of the most generous presale offers on the market. If you‚Äôre looking for a meme coin that‚Äôs more than just a pretty face, BTFD is it.

Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have tumbled, with BTC falling below 95K and ETH now down to the 3300 range. It has been over a month since Bitcoin touched 94K, and it continues trading in a range between 94K and 108K. Top altcoins are showing bearish momentum, with most coins down by 1% to 5% over the last 24 hours. The overall market cap has also dropped by approximately 2%, now standing at 3.28 trillion. Trading volume has seen a significant decline of 34%, as many investors are in a holiday mood and enjoying the last days of 2024. Market activity is expected to pick up after the first week of January when trading volume will likely return to normal levels. The Fear and Greed Index is currently at 51, indicating a neutral sentiment in the market. Crypto Market Today: BTC, ETH, XRP, and SOL Prices Drop Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, and Solana (SOL) have faced significant declines, mirroring the overall market downturn. The holiday season slowdown continues to impact trading volumes and prices. Bitcoin Market Today Bitcoin (BTC) price was trading at $94,327, down approximately 2% over the last 24 hours. Its 24-hour low and high were $93,440 and $97,429, respectively. Robert Kiyosaki has made a bold prediction , forecasting that Bitcoin will reach $350,000 by 2025 and urging investors to prioritize self-custody over institutional ETFs. According to SoSo Value , BTC ETFs saw an outflow of $367 million on Friday, with Fidelity accounting for $208 million of the outflow. Ark & 21Shares reported an outflow of $112 million, while data from BlackRock is still awaited. Ethereum Market Today Ethereum (ETH) price dropped by about 1%, now at $3,329, with a 24-hour low of $3,307 and a high of $3,441. The ETH ETF saw an inflow of $27 million yesterday, as Fidelity purchased $27 million worth of Ethereum. This shift in the crypto market today highlights the growing institutional interest in Ethereum. XRP Market Today XRP price was trading at $2.144 at the time of writing, down by approximately 2%. Its 24-hour low and high were $2.126 and $2.234, respectively. Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton has criticized a newly finalized crypto tax reporting rule issued by the Biden administration. Solana Market Today Solana (SOL) price was down by 2%, trading at $184. Its 24-hour low and high were $183 and $194, respectively. Coingape analysts reported the reason behind the Solana price dump . Meme Cryptocurrency Market Today Meme cryptocurrency market today is following the pattern of top altcoins. Dogecoin (DOGE) was down by 1%, trading at $0.3142, while Shiba Inu (SHIB) dropped by just half a percent in the last 24 hours. BONK, however, saw a 4% increase, with the ‚ÄúBURNmas‚Äù event contributing to the burn of over 1 trillion coins. Crypto Market Gainers Today Virtual Protocol Virtual Protocol (VIRTUAL) became the top gainer today, with its price jumping by 15% in the last 24 hours. Its 24-hour low and high were $3.05 and $3.58, respectively. Coingape analysts also reported the top cryptos to invest in for 2025. Bitget Token Bitget Token (BGB) price was up by 9% in the last 24 hours, trading at $8.36. The rise in price is mainly due to Bitget revealing plans for an $800 million token burn in the future. This development is affecting the crypto market today, driving positive momentum for Bitget Token. Crypto Market Losers Today FTX Token FTX Token (FTT) price was down by 16%, making it the worst-performing crypto in the last 24 hours. Its 24-hour low and high were $3.27 and $3.93, respectively. This decline reflects the challenges faced by FTX in the crypto market today. Zcash Zcash (ZEC) was down by 10%, trading at $61.72. Its 24-hour low and high were $61.61 and $68.92, respectively. This drop reflects the volatility in the crypto market today. Besides this, there has been no improvement in the hourly chart, and no major change in the price of top altcoins and Bitcoin in the last hour. Most likely, we will see significant price changes in the crypto market today next week, once the holiday period is over.

This move aims to provide investors new opportunities to leverage the Solana blockchain ecosystem. VolatilityShares Filled For Solana Futures ETF According to Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store VolatilityShares has recently proposed to launch a unique exchange-traded open-end index fund (ETF) based on Solana futures. As per the application, the proposed ETF will offer exposure to Solana futures with a variety of leverage options, including 1x, 2x, and -1x.

Solana ETF a Game-Changer? The proposed ETF will focus on Solana futures, trading exclusively on exchanges registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). This ensures a regulated and secure environment for investors, adding credibility to the crypto investment space. Solana, known for its lightning-fast transactions and low costs, has already captured the attention of the crypto community. If approved, this ETF could give investors a unique way to benefit from Solana‚Äôs growing ecosystem while catering to both risk-takers and cautious players.

Trump Cyborg (TRUMPCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCYB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Cyborg launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Cyborg on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Cyborg by entering its contract address ‚Äì 9yaNQ89EaQ2nEDczZpuTZfDwfiYCxbwSYC4JeiWLDE57 ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCYB.

Despite short-term declines, the cryptocurrency shows signs of stabilizing above a key support level. Recent Price Action Mirrors 2018 Trends Recent price movements have drawn comparisons to XRP‚Äôs behavior in 2018 when prices often surged beyond the upper Bollinger Band before retreating to the median line. XRP, which has dropped by approximately 5.18% over the past week, continues aligning with this historical pattern. Current projections suggest further declines could push the cryptocurrency to $2.103, a support level indicated by the lower Bollinger Band on the daily chart. According to data from CoinMarketCap, this would represent an additional 2.18% decrease from its current value of $2.15. Weekly Indicators Suggest Stabilization is Possible Despite these declines, the weekly Bollinger Bands present a more optimistic outlook. If the lower band on the weekly chart shifts upward, it could prevent XRP from falling to the grim $1 projection. This development would mitigate fears of a deeper decline and allow the cryptocurrency to consolidate above $2 soon. While uncertainty lingers, this potential stabilization provides hope for investors monitoring XRP‚Äôs performance closely. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Activity Signals Strength Amid Volatility XRP remains a key player in the cryptocurrency market, trading above $2 per token and holding the position of the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. With a market cap of $123 million and daily trading volumes reaching $4.67 billion, XRP‚Äôs activity underscores its resilience. These figures mark a significant turnaround compared to two months ago, highlighting how rapidly market dynamics can shift. While XRP‚Äôs current situation highlights opportunities and risks, its ability to hold above key support levels will determine its outlook. The weeks ahead will reveal whether XRP can capitalize on its current support level to mount a recovery or whether further declines are imminent. For now, market participants will continue to monitor the interplay between daily and weekly indicators to anticipate the next phase of price action. By staying above $2 and maintaining strong trading volumes, XRP is well-positioned to navigate this period of uncertainty, even as technical indicators point to potential short-term challenges.

Currently trading at $3,321, ETH‚Äôs resilience has been notable, especially amidst a broader market correction led by Bitcoin (BTC). This recent downturn has tested ETH‚Äôs critical support level at $3,290, effectively preventing a decline toward the psychologically significant $3,000 barrier. Could Ethereum Reach $14,000 By March 2025? Crypto expert Crypto Rover has made headlines with his bold prediction that ETH is poised for an ‚Äúexplosion‚Äù in the first quarter (Q1) of 2025. His confidence is bolstered by historical trends observed in previous Bitcoin Halving years, particularly in 2017 and 2021, where ETH experienced substantial double-digit increases from January through March. In 2017, Ethereum recorded impressive monthly gains of 31.9% in January, 48% in February, and a staggering 214% in March. Similarly, in 2021, ETH saw significant gains of 78.5% in January, 8.4% in February, and 34.7% in March. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reserve Idea Sparks Cautious Response From Japan PM: Report According to the expert‚Äôs analysis, these historical trends indicate that if Ethereum sustains its current price level for the rest of the year, it could experience a comparable path in 2025. Based on these historical figures and averages from the price increases between 2017 and 2021, it is possible that ETH might reach about $5,000 in January, around $6,400 in February, and by March, it could soar to $14,336 per token. Such increases would not only signify a recovery but also potentially triple Ethereum‚Äôs all-time high of $4,878 reached in November 2021. Beyond Ethereum, other altcoins such as XRP, Solana (SOL), Binance Coin (BNB), and even meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) are also expected to benefit from this market correction and consolidation. Crypto Rover has also cautioned altcoin holders, stating, ‚ÄúNow is the worst time to sell. Our portfolios still have the potential to do a 10x from here. The next three months are going to be incredible.‚Äù Key Support Levels For ETH‚Äôs Price In addition to these bullish predictions, analyst Gabriel Maur has weighed in on Ethereum‚Äôs current price action, emphasizing key support levels between $2,800 and $2,900. The analyst notes that the structure of support has transitioned into resistance, which, once broken, becomes a crucial support level.

This growth has reinforced investor confidence in cryptocurrencies and paved the way for broader acceptance within the financial markets. As institutional adoption gains momentum, the cryptocurrency landscape is set to evolve further. Bitcoin‚Äôs remarkable performance in 2024 has left a lasting impression on the financial world. This development has sparked renewed interest among both seasoned investors and newcomers eager to explore the cryptocurrency market. It has become clear that Bitcoin‚Äôs rise is more than just a passing trend ‚Äì it‚Äôs a sign of the times. Additionally, the integration of cryptocurrency into alternative sources like online gambling is reshaping how players engage with gaming platforms. For instance, Cryptorino casino reviewed by the experts at Kryptocasinos demonstrates how this niche is gaining popularity among enthusiasts who value both transparency and innovation in their gaming experiences.

Bitcoin‚Äôs Impact on the Financial Market The surge of Bitcoin in 2024 has undeniably shifted the dynamics of the financial market. By outperforming traditional assets such as stocks and gold, Bitcoin has proven its worth as a reliable investment option amidst economic uncertainty. This shift can be attributed to several factors, including growing institutional adoption and enhanced regulatory clarity, which have collectively bolstered investor confidence. Institutional investors, who were once skeptical of cryptocurrencies, are now showing increased interest in Bitcoin due to its potential for high returns. The presence of big players in the market has not only legitimized Bitcoin but has also provided a much-needed boost to its liquidity. Furthermore, clearer regulatory frameworks have alleviated some of the concerns surrounding security and legality, making it easier for investors to participate in the crypto market. This shift towards Bitcoin is indicative of a broader trend where digital currencies are becoming integral to diversified investment portfolios. As traditional financial institutions begin to embrace cryptocurrencies , people can expect further integration and acceptance within mainstream finance. This evolution is poised to redefine how people perceive and interact with money in the years to come. Cryptocurrency in Mainstream Finance The increasing acceptance of cryptocurrencies in mainstream finance marks a pivotal moment for digital currencies. In 2024 alone, several key developments have accelerated this trend. Notable among these is the integration of cryptocurrencies into payment systems by major corporations, enhancing their usability for everyday transactions. This mainstream acceptance is further underscored by the introduction of crypto-based financial products such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which provide a bridge between traditional finance and digital assets. These products offer retail investors easier access to cryptocurrencies without needing to directly purchase or manage them. As awareness grows, more individuals are likely to consider incorporating digital assets into their investment strategies. As cryptocurrencies become more embedded within conventional financial systems, their role as legitimate assets continues to solidify. This transition reflects changing consumer preferences and technological advancements that favor decentralized financial solutions over centralized ones. Future Outlook for Cryptocurrencies Looking ahead to 2025, there are both challenges and opportunities awaiting cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and altcoins. Technological advancements will continue driving innovation within blockchain networks while also addressing scalability issues that currently limit widespread adoption. Regulatory developments will play a crucial role in shaping future trends across global markets. However, greater transparency could lead to increased acceptance among regulators worldwide ‚Äì ultimately benefiting long-term growth prospects within this dynamic industry sector. The convergence between technology companies investing heavily into blockchain research alongside existing financial institutions exploring new avenues presents exciting possibilities moving forward, bringing the world closer to realizing the full potential inherent within decentralized finance ecosystems today.

This has led to a weakened Korean won (KRW) and a higher price for the leading cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Kimchi Premium Surges In South Korea According to CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, the KRW-USD trading pair has reached a 15-year low, reflecting dwindling confidence among South Koreans in their fiat currency. The depreciating won has driven South Koreans to invest in emerging assets like Bitcoin to safeguard the purchasing power of their KRW during times of economic uncertainty. In a post on X, Ju explained that South Korean crypto traders are increasingly converting KRW into cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and USD-pegged stablecoin USDT on the Upbit exchange, where BTC is trading at a premium of 3-5%. This price difference, commonly referred to as the Bitcoin ‚Äòkimchi premium,‚Äô occurs when BTC trades at a higher price on South Korean exchanges compared to global platforms. Typically, the so-called kimchi premium arises due to high local demand , increasing regulatory barriers, and limited arbitrage opportunities in South Korea‚Äôs cryptocurrency market. However, in this instance the premium is primarily driven by the weakening KRW due to rising political turmoil in the country. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading in South Korea for 145,000,000 KRW or approximately $98,600, while on a global exchange like Binance, BTC is trading at $95,315. The difference between these platforms highlights the impact of the kimchi premium. What‚Äôs Causing The KRW Decline? The South Korean won‚Äôs decline can be attributed to ongoing political unrest, which has intensified since December 3. On this date, the now-impeached, former president Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law for six hours before reversing the decision. Following this, South Korea‚Äôs parliament impeached Han Duck-soo, the country‚Äôs prime minister and acting president. These dramatic developments have sent shockwaves through global markets, undermining confidence in South Korea‚Äôs democratic institutions and raising fears of the country facing its worst political crisis in decades. The monthly chart below illustrates how the KRW has plunged to its lowest value against the USD since March 2009. In a separate post on X, Jeff Park, head of alpha strategies at investment manager Bitwise, highlighted that South Korea‚Äôs political turmoil centers on allegations of election fraud and a loss of trust in the country‚Äôs National Election Commission (NEC). Park commented: The use of impeachment as a political tool, combined with allegations of foreign election interference, underscores the fragility of democracy in the face of disinformation. This is not just a Korean story; it‚Äôs a warning for democracies worldwide. The political unrest in South Korea has sent its cryptocurrency market into a frenzy , leading to record-breaking trading volumes. At press time, BTC trades at $95,315, down 0.2% in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin News|binance|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|KimChi Premium|KRWUSD|political crisis|South Korea|Upbit,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|SEI|JUP|BSV|WLD|APE|HNT|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2024-12-28 05:00:14

Del Mar Energy Inc. has patented a new technology,https://timestabloid.com/a-new-kind-of-alternative-energy-source-del-mar-energy-inc-has-patented-a-new-technology/,"Del Mar Energy Inc., a recognized leader in advanced energy technologies, has made a significant scientific breakthrough by proposing an innovative approach to energy generation that has the potential to fundamentally change the current energy paradigm. The developed methodology not only solves the problem of global energy supply, but also helps minimize environmental risks associated with traditional energy sources. The company‚Äôs key innovation is based on the use of piezoactive materials ‚Äì complex composites that have the ability to convert mechanical vibrations into electric current. What makes the approach unique is the versatility of the technology, which allows energy to be extracted from a wide range of mechanical influences such as vehicle vibrations, acoustic waves and even human movement. This wide range of applications makes piezoactive materials a promising tool for energy systems of different scales ‚Äì from stand-alone devices to large infrastructure facilities. At the official presentation, Del Mar Energy Inc.‚Äôs CEO, Michael Lattema, emphasized the strategic importance of the development, ‚ÄúWe stand at the threshold of a new technological era. Our achievements are not only a scientific breakthrough, but also an opportunity to rethink the role of energy in ensuring the sustainable development of society‚Äù. One of the key characteristics of the new technology is its environmental neutrality. The process of producing and using piezoactive materials minimizes dependence on rare earth elements, which helps reduce the carbon footprint and vulnerability of global supply chains. In addition, an energy generation system based on these materials creates virtually no waste, making it environmentally friendly. Potential applications of the technology are already being actively discussed in expert circles. For example, it is proposed to use piezoactive materials in road surfaces, where energy can be generated by mechanical effects from vehicle traffic. Additionally, research is underway to integrate the technology into the architecture of energy-efficient buildings, which could partially power themselves through vibrations caused by wind loads or operational activity. Renewable energy experts praise the potential of this invention. Edward Hoffman, a professor of energy systems at Harvard University, said, ‚ÄúThe technology proposed by Del Mar Energy Inc. opens new perspectives for the transition to sustainable energy. If it can be scaled and integrated into existing infrastructure, it will significantly reduce dependence on fossil fuels.‚Äù The company intends to launch pilot projects in three key markets ‚Äì North America, Europe and Asia. Successful completion of testing will pave the way for mass adoption of the technology in the coming decades. Del Mar Energy Inc. estimates that their development will become an integral element of the global energy system based on the principles of sustainability and efficiency. Del Mar Energy Inc.‚Äôs achievement represents an outstanding example of the synergy of scientific research and innovative technologies aimed at solving global challenges. The company encourages the international community of scientists and engineers to collaborate to create an energy ecosystem capable of ensuring a sustainable future for all.

Their currency market exchange rates can vary with as much volatility as BTC and tend to track along with Bitcoin‚Äôs price. In fact, big rallies for BTC tend to lead to major bull runs in altcoin markets as well. Seasoned crypto day and swing traders refer to these movements as ‚Äúalt season.‚Äù While Bitcoin posted a price gain of 121% from New Year‚Äôs Day to Christmas Eve this year, the following six altcoins saw increases ranging from 1,249% to a staggering 1.84 million percent for a latecomer to altcoin markets this year that only launched in October. Lower down in this article is the entire list of top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap ranked in order of gains they delivered from Jan. 1 through Dec. 24 this year. The author calculated these gains by taking the average crypto exchange price on Dec. 24 and dividing it by the average price on Jan. 1. Accordingly, some coins may be more or less profitable to day trade or swing trade than they appear on this list due to their market movements between the beginning and end dates for this calculation. Several of these coins would show much higher percentage gains if the end date were calculated from price peaks that happened earlier in the year. But here are the six that did best for investors who dollar cost average or hold long term. 1. Fartcoin Blew Investors Away This Year Fartcoin now valued at $1.2 Billion ‚Äì what an explosion! pic.twitter.com/q53MnDbJwh ‚Äî Barchart (@Barchart) December 24, 2024 The silent but violent creeper rally for Fartcoin blew away crypto markets this year. This hot meme coin is a fresh one. It began to rally right out the gate following its launch in mid-October. Following the November election, however, this Solana Program Library meme coin really ripped. Trump‚Äôs reelection saw most crypto markets rally, but Fartcoin posted a 300% gain in a matter of days from Nov. 5 through Nov. 18. Then in December, Fartcoin took another leg up to above $1 by Dec. 19. Now, Fartcoin is poised to run to $2 per token on popular Solana decentralized exchanges (DEX) like Radium and Meteroa VD. What could be behind such a hilarious meme economy? Perhaps it has something to do with the name Trump being a traditional slang term for a‚Äîwell for‚Äîa Bronx cheer. In addition, this meme coin is the latest demonstration of the ease of use, low fees, and high liquidity for issuing new currency on the Solana network. The smart contract Layer 1 blockchain continues neck-and-neck with Ethereum in the race to dominate decentralized finance. From its debut through Dec. 24, Fartcoin‚Äôs price posted a percentage gain of 1,847,357%, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Who would have thought that a currency named Fartcoin would earn the highest percentage gains of any cryptocurrency in 2024? Anyone who‚Äôs been paying attention to the meme coin sector: These ragtag upstarts are decidedly the shock jocks of the digital finance industry. 2. MANTRA Bags Win For RWA Tokenization Several meme coins have flown up the price charts in 2024, but so also have altcoins with specific use cases and direct utility. That‚Äôs shown the market‚Äôs demand for currencies that power useful applications and artificial intelligence (AI). Mantra continued hitting new ATHs all year, in June, July, and October, and then surged to a major peak in November, which dwarfed all previous records. From January through December, this crypto gained the second most ROI out of any top 100 coin. Mantra‚Äôs (OM) crypto token is the currency that powers its Layer-1 blockchain focused on security and optimized for real-world asset tokenization (RWA). The platform is built from the ground up to comply with and enforce real-world regulatory requirements in accounting for real-world assets. Why Mantra‚Äôs Price Ratcheted Up In 2024 Launched in Q4 2020, Mantra has come a long way in the meantime. A big part of Mantra OM‚Äôs rise this year is its successful attainment of licensing from financial authorities to remain compliant with regulators as it expands to a global user base. Mantra secured licensing from authorities in the United Arab Emirates in addition to its license to operate and provide regulated financial services in Hong Kong. That will help it to become a key player in building a truly global ‚ÄúInternet of Things.‚Äù In June, Mantra‚Äôs (OM) tokens achieved an all-time high of $1.09. Moreover, this was a remarkable milestone because the rest of the cryptocurrency market was in a slump at the time. That milestone came as a result of a partnership between Mantra and the UAE‚Äôs Zand Bank. The two are collaborating to define clear frameworks for RWA tokenization that comply with the Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority of Dubai. After that, OM hit another all-time record high in October. That came after Mantra‚Äôs price surged more than 60% in under 30 days to nearly $1.50 with a total market cap of $1.2 billion. Overall, Mantra (OM)‚Äôs price gained 8,776% on crypto markets from Jan. to Dec. this year. 3. Virtuals Protocol Wins Crypto AI Meta Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) is a new Layer-2 decentralized protocol that works across blockchain L1s and the Web 1.0 and 2.0 layers. But its main feature is the tokenized, decentralized creation and management of ‚ÄúAI agents.‚Äù These artificially intelligent agents can be deployed from the blockchain to social media apps like Telegram and to online games and metaverses‚Äîhence the name Virtuals. As a result of its enormous increases, the token for Virtuals Protocol was the third biggest gainer in 2024. From Jan. 1 to Dec. 24, VIRTUAL grew in price by 6,068%. 4. Ondo, Another Sweep for RWA Tokenization Markets heavily rewarded real-world asset tokenization in 2024. They also liked currency platforms with other specific, unique, and valuable use cases (think Render token and AIOZ Network). The appearance, however, of not one but two different RWA tokens in the six leading cryptos by ROI in 2024 underscores the promise of this segment. Ondo is another RWA token that saw posted big gains. Ondo tokens allow users to participate in its decentralized autonomous organization and have special perks for users of Flux Finance, which is governed by Ondo DAO. Altcoin traders know that winners tend to win again. Ondo hit new all-time high exchange rates in April , March, and May before doing so again in December . That supported its class-leading gains this year. Ondo‚Äôs price increased from Jan. 1 to Dec. 24 by 1,758%. 5. Aerodome Chalks Boon For Decentralized Exchanges Utility and memes hauled the most annual ROI in 2024. Utility strikes again with Aerodome, an automated market maker (AMM) for Coinbase‚Äôs Ethereum Layer-2 platform, Base. Aerodrome works by serving Base‚Äôs central liquidity hub with a clever liquidity incentive engine governed by a decentralized consensus model. Exchange rates for its AERO tokens took flight this year. Listed on crypto exchanges starting in Aug. 2023, Aerodome (AERO) hit soaring ATHs in Mar. and Apr. this year. The AMM altcoin did it again in Dec.. From Jan. 1 to Dec. 24, AERO notched 1,672%. 6. Pepe Memes Still Hot Coin In 2024 The original and leading Pepe economy brings up the rear on this list of top gainers this year. What can you really say about Pepe? Memeing Web3 feels good , man. Pepe gained 1,249% from Jan. 1. to Dec. 24 this year.

She filed some grave charges against Akridge for using her blockchain expertise to¬†take millions of dollars worth of staking rewards from her Solana holdings. According to the lawsuit, Akridge allegedly controlled her crypto accounts between March and May, taking all the staking commissions for himself. The couple ended their 10-year marriage in February 2023. Rossi has filed a lawsuit accusing Akridge of breaking agreements, unfairly benefiting from her money, and committing fraud. She is asking for compensation for the financial losses she says he caused her. Co-founded by Stephen Akridge, along with Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal, Solana has played a key role in advancing decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 technologies. Akridge, who previously worked at Qualcomm, was a principal engineer at Solana and is now the CEO of Cyber Grant, a cybersecurity company. A Complex Crypto Case The case highlights the challenges of managing crypto assets in personal disputes. Staking rewards are a popular way for crypto holders to earn passive income, with Solana offering annual yields of 5.6% to 12%. Liquid staking platforms like Jito make this even more attractive by allowing users to earn extra rewards through decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Community Reactions and Next Steps So far, neither Akridge nor Solana Labs has commented on the allegations. The lawsuit has drawn attention from the crypto community, involving personal and financial disputes tied to the rapidly growing blockchain space. As Solana continues to grow in the DeFi world, this case reminds us of the importance of clear asset management, especially in high-stakes environments like crypto. The outcome of this legal battle could set a precedent for how similar cases are handled. With Solana ETFs on the way, such negative news can impact future adoptions raising questions on crypto integrity.",News|Crypto Scam,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|SOL,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-28 05:16:44

Blockchain tracker Whale Alert detected the transfer of nearly three trillion SHIB tokens, an event linked to BTCTurk, Turkey‚Äôs second-largest centralized cryptocurrency exchange. The movement of such a significant amount of SHIB has sparked discussion and speculation about its purpose. Massive SHIB Transaction Uncovered The transaction involved the transfer of 2,884,590,622,344 SHIB tokens, valued at approximately $65.7 million. Whale Alert identified the funds as being moved from BTCTurk to an anonymous wallet. On-chain data reveals that the transfer occurred within the past 17 hours. This movement of one of the most recognized meme coins has captured the attention of crypto enthusiasts, with some suggesting it could involve a large holder, or ‚Äúwhale,‚Äù moving their assets. BTCTurk, however, clarified that the transfer was part of routine operations. A statement says, ‚Äúthese transfers are fully managed by us, and there is nothing out of the ordinary.‚Äù We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Additional Transactions and Speculation The SHIB transfer was not the only large movement tracked by Whale Alert. The platform also reported three significant Ethereum (ETH) transactions from BTCTurk. These transfers included 23,285 ETH, 20,000 ETH, and another 20,000 ETH, collectively valued at $220 million. BTCTurk explained that these transactions were part of their ‚Äúwallet optimization efforts.‚Äù Despite this clarification, some crypto community members speculated about the nature of these movements, with concerns raised about the possibility of a security breach. The exchange responded to these speculations directly under Whale Alert‚Äôs posts, reiterating that the transfers were internal and standard operational procedures. SHIB Metaverse Launches on Shibarium Meanwhile, the Shiba Inu team has made progress on a long-awaited project. The SHIB Metaverse is now accessible for early users through the Shibarium blockchain. This development marks a significant milestone for the SHIB ecosystem after years of preparation by the team, including the pseudonymous leader, Shytoshi Kusama. Users can now connect their wallets to the Metaverse, claim virtual land plots, and explore various features. This virtual environment allows users to construct homes, explore temples, interact with nature, and participate in community-building activities. The launch represents a significant step in expanding the utility of SHIB beyond its meme coin origins. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Dogecoin remains the leading crypto in the meme coin ecosystem. A recent change in fortune has seen the Dogecoin price drop by over 20%, but the Dogecoin bulls are fighting back. Meanwhile, DOGE investors are looking at Lunex Network , a new decentralized finance (DeFi) token, as a viable crypto investment to diversify their portfolios. Currently in presale, Lunex has raised over $5.5 million and there‚Äôs more to come. Let‚Äôs find out why investors are bullish on the relatively unknown crypto project before launch. A DOGE alternative is a great idea for investors While the numbers look good for DOGE presently, the meme coin faces a challenge ‚Äì it‚Äôs a coin backed by social media hype from influential personalities like Elon Musk. That means a slowdown in its hype could result in less demand for the meme token, especially since competitors like PEPE and WIF have higher gains. That‚Äôs why utility-backed assets like Lunex are great options for Dogecoin investors. The Lunex Network is already showing how much utility has on price growth with its presale , which has raised over $5.5 million. What are these use cases? First, the Lunex ecosystem has a cross-chain DEX that supports trading across multiple blockchain networks. With over 50,000 crypto pairs, the DEX prevents liquidity issues for DeFi traders and investors. There‚Äôs also a self-custodial wallet to store any of the supported cryptocurrencies. With support for over 40 blockchains and thousands of assets, it‚Äôs easy to store and manage funds on a single device. Moreover, Lunex token holders can stake their coins for up to 18% APY. These exciting features make Lunex a great crypto investment for investors. Interestingly, the ongoing presale provides a limited-time opportunity for interested investors to stack up LNEX tokens at a discounted rate of $0.0048. Dogecoin maintains pole position in the meme coin market Dogecoin has been in the news after its year-on-year growth of over 250%. However, the recent price drop in the broader crypto market saw its market cap threatened. After falling into the red zone in the past week, the DOGE price and market cap are now back up. For context, the Dogecoin price is down by about 13% in recent days. However, DOGE bulls have been fighting back, evident through its rebounding price. Similarly, the DOGE market cap has increased by over 3% within the same period per data from CoinMarketCap, reinforcing the coin‚Äôs position as the top meme cryptocurrency by market capitalization. However, there‚Äôs still a long way to go for DOGE to turn around the losses from the past weeks into gains. Can DOGE reach $1 in 2025? There have been different DOGE price predictions ahead of the new year. Many believe that DOGE will move from its current price of less than $1 to be the next meme coin to reach $1. The optimistic DOGE price prediction makes it a potentially rewarding crypto investment for investors and traders looking for short-term gains. The potential increase will be influenced by factors like Elon Musk and his social media hype, Donald Trump‚Äôs new administration, and increased demand for DOGE among traders.

CIFR's strategic growth includes significant capacity increases in Texas, with new facilities like Black Pearl and Stingray, enhancing mining efficiency and computational power. Despite cash burn concerns, CIFR's low production costs and high gross margins position it well to capitalize on the ongoing cryptocurrency bull market. I upgrade CIFR to a ""Buy"" due to its growth potential in Bitcoin, AI, and HPC markets, though investors should expect high volatility. Cipher Mining Inc. ( CIFR ) is currently working towards strengthening its positioning among Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining and high-performance computing [HPC] infrastructure. To this end, CIFR focuses on obtaining low-cost energy and operational efficiencies as it builds its data center capacity. CIFR‚Äôs growing mining fleet is also adapting to the challenges of the 2024 Bitcoin halving and potentially volatile market conditions. So far, CIFR‚Äôs operations have increased with the acquisition and development of new facilities. Its target is to reach 23.5 EH/s by the end of 2025. Similarly, the company believes its business is also a good fit for the emerging AI and HPC market trends. For instance, Meta ( META ) and Nvidia ( NVDA ) use CIFR‚Äôs infrastructure. So I lean bullish on CIFR‚Äôs as it has a low-cost production model backed by secular tailwinds with high Bitcoin prices. More than a Miner: Business Overview Cipher Mining Inc. is a technology and infrastructure company that develops and operates data centers designed for Bitcoin mining. It also uses excedent energy monetization by providing infrastructure for Artificial Intelligence [AI] and High-Performance Computing [HPC] tasks. Source: Corporate Presentation. October 31, 2024. Since my previous analysis , CIFR has made surprising progress as it scaled its operations ahead of the 2024 Bitcoin [BTC] halving. This is why CIFR is now able to reap the rewards from those strategic decisions, as Bitcoin mining rewards are now cut by half, which typically heralds a secular bull market in cryptocurrencies. Texas Play: Strategic Growth Moreover, CIFR successfully increased its capacity by 300 MW with its 70-acre Black Pearl facility in Texas. This will essentially increase the efficiency and hash rate it uses to provide its mining and computing services. CIFR‚Äôs goal is to reach a production of 23.5 exahash per second [EH/s] by the end of 2025, which would basically make CIFR a leader in its industry. Thus, CIFR‚Äôs Black Pearl site‚Äôs production will contribute to this goal by enabling more mining rigs and boosting the computational power rate. The data center at the Black Pearl site is under construction and scheduled to be operational in Q2 2025. Source: Corporate Presentation. October 31, 2024. Additionally, on November 26, 2024, CIFR announced the acquisition of another 250-acre site in Stingray, West Texas. As you may have noticed, Texas is a sector with low-cost energy resources, which is ideal for CIFR‚Äôs business model. The company disclosed it paid $4.1 million upfront and signed the agreement to a variable fee of $1.5 per megawatt-hour [MWh] for five years after the site started operations. The variable cost is linked to the amount of energy CIFR‚Äôs installation consumes from the grid. After all, this site is directly connected to the main power grid with an agreement with ONCOR that will be fully supplied by 1H2026. Mining Efficiency and Future Expansion Furthermore, on December 03, 2024, the company recently disclosed that 202 Bitcoins were mined in November. This included 30 Bitcoins mined at joint venture data centers and 13 Bitcoins from excess electricity monetized at $96,542 per Bitcoin. In other words, in that single month, it generated roughly $19.5 million in revenues, which implies an impressive annual revenue run rate of $234.0 million. However, CIFR actually sold 234 Bitcoin to manage its liquidity and still held another 1,383 Bitcoin in its treasury. In fact, it has 258 Bitcoin as collateral to ensure its financial operations. Additionally, CIFR has 76,000 mining rigs deployed, with 12.0 EH/s, which is close to their year-end 2024 target of 13.5 EH/s for bitcoin mining. Likewise, its fleet‚Äôs efficiency (energy consumption per terahash) was 20.8 joules per terahash [J/TH], slightly less than the projected value of 18.9 J/TH. So, while CIFR seems to have come in slightly below its internal projections, it‚Äôs still benefiting immensely from the ongoing bull market in Bitcoin. Source: Corporate Presentation. October 31, 2024. It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that CIFR‚Äôs Odessa site has upgrades that should be ready by year-end 2024. If they materialize, it could place its operations among the industry‚Äôs most efficient mining fleets. This matters because, together with the Black Pearl site, the new Stingray facility, and a total of 11 sites, CIFR would reach a total power pipeline of 2.6 GW by 2027. Bitcoin and HPC Markets Currently, the Bitcoin mining industry reported record-low hash prices in Q3 2024, which translated into reduced revenues. However, CIFR mitigated these headwinds with its low-cost units, which are as low as $0.027/kWH. This means that in 2024, the company achieved an all-in cost of production for one Bitcoin of approximately $18,162. This production cost implies an extraordinarily favorable ROIC, as Bitcoin trades multiple times higher than that. Note that these costs already include energy, grid fees, and other energy-linked expenses. Moreover, CIFR‚Äôs Odessa has the lowest electricity cost per Bitcoin, approximately $17,561. This facility is the company‚Äôs primary production hub and contributes around 83% of its Bitcoin mining operations. The rest of its mining comes from joint venture facilities with higher costs than Odessa, with a mean cost per Bitcoin of $22,928. Source: Corporate Presentation. October 31, 2024. CIFR is currently among the leading Bitcoin miners in terms of Bitcoin production costs. For comparison, miners such as the giant Marathon Digital Holdings ( MARA ) had an average electricity cost of $22,000 to $24,000 per BTC. Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) had a power-related cost average of around $26,000 . However, RIO has higher than CIFR‚Äôs mining costs, averaging approximately $20,000 per BTC. Hut 8 Mining ( HUT ) is closer to CIFR because it also aims to be a diversified company that offers HPC workloads. But again, HUT‚Äôs costs are around $31,482 per Bitcoin mined as of Q3 2024. Moreover, in hash rate terms, CIFR‚Äôs target of 35 EH/s with fleet efficiency of 15 J/TH by year-end 2025 would only strengthen its cost advantage due to low energy costs and operational efficiency. Source: Corporate Presentation. October 31, 2024. According to its latest earnings call , the company plans on expanding its capacity to 927 MW in 2025. For this, it‚Äôll increase by 866 MW with new facilities, like the Black Pearl, as it becomes operational. The increase in capacity from 327 MW in 2024 to 927 MW in 2025 is part of the company‚Äôs strategy to grow and produce Bitcoins as efficiently as possible. Furthermore, CIFR is leveraging its large sites, fast energization, and the use of its data centers by major companies like McKinsey, Meta, and Nvidia. In fact, the company believes it can become a key player in the HPC and AI markets. This is why CIFR is actually well-positioned to capitalize on the current power scarcity and support computing loads for these types of corporate tasks. In a way, CIFR‚Äôs mining operations give it a unique set of competitive advantages to fulfill those requirements. Diversification with AI and HPC is key because it‚Äôll transform CIFR from a pure-miner play closer to a general computing firm. Mining is highly profitable during a bull market, but AI and HPC are much more stable with recurring revenue streams, which lowers CIFR‚Äôs exposure to Bitcoin‚Äôs cyclicality. You see, most of CIFR‚Äôs data centers, like the Odessa site, have Application-Specific Integrated Circuit [ASIC] mining rigs designed for cryptocurrency mining. However, the newer projects like the Black Pearl and Stingray facilities are developed to support dual purposes including Bitcoin mining and colocation agreements for AI and HPC tenants. Source: CME. These tenants use GPUs and other specialized equipment requiring specific cooling systems, high bandwidth, and redundant power supplies. The company plans to integrate its AI and HPC capacities into its broader 2.6 GW total power potential by 2027, which indicates an emphasis on the new focus of its portfolio. But it also shows its business will be much more flexible going forward. For instance, industry data suggests AI inference workloads can generate $7 in revenue for every $1 spent on GPU over four years. This is likely significantly higher than Bitcoin mining‚Äôs ROI during a bear market. So, dedicating a fraction of its capacity to HPC tasks lets CIFR tap into that growing global AI market . Computing demand from that sector is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 37% from 2024 to 2030. It‚Äôs also worth highlighting that on December 16, 2024, Bitcoin hit a record-high price of $106,449. For instance, the US elections were a positive catalyst for the price of Bitcoin because President Trump has repeatedly signaled a favorable stance towards this industry. Also, the Fed is on a rate-cutting cycle , which should act as an additional tailwind for asset prices as well. The CME rate probability tool suggests there‚Äôs an 82.7% aggregate probability of lower rates by December 2025. In my opinion this will give a macro environment for CIFR‚Äôs business. Relatively Cheap: Valuation Analysis From a valuation perspective, CIFR trades at a $1.9 billion market cap. This means the company is no longer a microcap, but I also believe there‚Äôs still more room to grow as long as the cryptocurrency secular bull market continues. As of Q3 2024, CIFR‚Äôs balance sheet held $25.3 million in cash and short-term investments against no financial debt other than typical operating liabilities. I also see its balance sheet also has $95.5 million worth of Bitcoin. Its equity book value reached $672.0 million, suggesting a P/B of 2.3. This actually appears reasonable compared to its sector‚Äôs median P/B of 3.5. Source: Seeking Alpha. According to Seeking Alpha‚Äôs dashboard on CIFR, CIFR is projected to generate $301.1 million in revenues by 2025. Naturally, we need to take these projects with a grain of salt because they rely substantially on the price of Bitcoin. As long as the current cryptocurrency bull market continues, it should be a realistic projection, but I believe its long-term revenue growth will be highly volatile because the underlying commodity is highly erratic as well. Investment Caveats and Risk Analysis Nonetheless, $301.1 million in future revenues implies a forward P/S of 6.3. This is actually slightly higher than its sector‚Äôs median forward P/S of 3.3. Still, I believe the main metric to track is CIFR‚Äôs gross margins, which should capture its Bitcoin production cost relative to the price it realizes when monetizing it. Currently, CIFR‚Äôs gross margins stand at 62.3%, which is significantly higher than its sector‚Äôs gross margins of 51.0%. However, we can‚Äôt ignore that if CIFR‚Äôs infrastructure expansion somehow leads to higher production costs, it could hit substantially its margins. Similarly, if the price of Bitcoin declines substantially, it could lead to equally large shareholder losses. Investors need to fully understand that, for now, CIFR remains largely a derivative on the price of Bitcoin itself. In the long run, CIFR‚Äôs operations might diversify more into other areas like AI and HPC computing, but for now, it‚Äôs still largely a miner and nothing more. As with other mining companies, as long as the underlying commodity rallies, the stock will likely follow as well. But the inverse is also true, so new investors need to understand this is a highly cyclical security by nature. Source: CIFR‚Äôs latest 10-Q. Another potential red flag is that CIFR‚Äôs cash burn remains persistent despite its secular tailwinds. I estimate CIFR‚Äôs trailing nine-month cash burn reached $224.5 million by adding its CFOs and Net CAPEX. This figure includes its intangible asset purchases and Bitcoin sales. Clearly, CIFR has made substantial CAPEX investments expecting to monetize them into 2025, but if the price of Bitcoin declines, it could also lead to massive losses for investors. Source: TradingView. Nevertheless, on balance, I believe it‚Äôs fair to lean bullish on CIFR, as it‚Äôs focused on growing its operations to capitalize on a multitude of highly promising secular trends (Bitcoin, AI, HPC computing). Hence, I feel it‚Äôs fair to upgrade CIFR to a ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù for investors who understand this will be a volatile security. ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù Upgrade: Conclusion Overall, I believe CIFR has outpaced my initial expectations, which is why I feel it deserves a rating upgrade. In particular, I like its pivot towards potentially diversifying its business in the long run with AI and HPC computing. Also, as long as the ongoing cryptocurrency bull market persists, the company seems well-positioned to continue creating shareholder value. I do have some cash burn concerns, but if Bitcoin rallies more into 2025, then I anticipate CIFR will generate substantial revenues that will allow it to recoup its 2024 CAPEX. Thus, I rate CIFR a ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù for investors who understand this is a highly cyclical and volatile stock closely linked to the price of Bitcoin itself.",BTC-USD|CIFR|CIFRW,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-12-28 05:31:21

Prince Elon (ELONPRIN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONPRIN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Prince Elon can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Prince Elon could become the next viral memecoin. Prince Elon launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Prince Elon on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Prince Elon by entering its contract address ‚Äì 7rAsmWGTtPFY9RFnhd9biard7PrWtw5ZigowwfmaXUQ ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others.

If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONPRIN.

The pullback may be scary to some, but that‚Äôs just what happens in the crypto market. As these coins go through hard times, savvy investors are turning to Lunex Network and its trailblazing presale. This project is turning heads and has an explosive potential that would see it rise to unprecedented levels. That is why many have dubbed it the fastest growing crypto token today. Lunex Network Presale Keeps Soaring Higher Lunex Network is a brand new presale that is shaking things up pretty well right now. Even though it debuted just a couple of months ago, it has raised over $5.5 million from investors. In addition to that, 2.5 trillion tokens have been sold in the presale, since everyone wants a piece of it. The major reason investors are going in on Lunex is its potential for accelerated growth. The protocol champions crypto swaps across multiple blockchain networks, which is a groundbreaking feature in the DEX arena. To top that, Lunex favors community growth and development. This is evident in its staking rewards and revenue sharing strategies. Lunex tokens are purchased from the open market and a portion of this is shared amongst LNEX holders as staking rewards. In this manner, LNEX rewards loyal holders and simultaneously fosters a strong community. These features combine to paint a stellar future for the project. The Lunex presale is available for $0.0048 but it is billed to appreciate by 800% before the presale ends. This is why several experts have called it the fastest growing crypto of the moment. Will Chainlink Price Weather The Crypto Storm? Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that is very important for the efficient execution of smart contracts. But this has not spared Chainlink price from the latest market correction. LINK has shed just about 15% from its peak in early December and now consolidates around $242. Despite the current slump, analysts still have a positive outlook for Chainlink. Technical indicators continue to show bullish LINK predictions. Given Chainlink‚Äôs importance to smart contracts, there‚Äôs a good chance of a LINK resurgence. Toncoin Slides Dangerously After November Boom TON is the native token of the Telegram Open Network (TON), and its November rally has drawn genuine interest from investors. But since the last market correction, Toncoin has shed significant portions of its value, and TON holders are starting to get concerned. To put things into perspective, TON fell by as much as 15% over the last couple of weeks and it has been on a downward trend since the market correction. Despite the temporary setback, experts maintain conservative optimism about TON‚Äôs future. But it‚Äôs better to take this optimism with a pinch of salt. Join the fastest growing crypto train Owing to their struggles after the last market correction, investors aren‚Äôt too keen on TON and Chainlink. This dip didn‚Äôt affect Lunex Network since it‚Äôs a crypto presale, and that is why it is a highly recommended investment option. Lunex Network is starting a revolutionary movement, and it‚Äôs only a matter of time before it goes viral. Joining the Lunex train before it hits the limelight could fetch investors profits in excess of 10,000%. No one should miss out on it.

Regulatory changes and a crypto-friendly SEC leadership could enhance Bitcoin ETF efficiency, making IBIT more appealing and reducing costs for investors. Short-term volatility persists, but demand-supply dynamics and miners' HODLing behavior support a bullish outlook for Bitcoin and IBIT by 2025. IBIT offers a convenient way for investors to gain crypto exposure without direct ownership hassles, benefiting from BlackRock's management and liquidity. After a 15% dive from its mid-December peak of $60.7, the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) trades around $53.5. It has heftily outperformed the S&P 500 this year, showing crypto's resiliency in a highly volatile year, as highlighted by the orange chart below. seekingalpha.com After the election of a crypto-friendly President and powerful rhetoric like elevating Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) to become a national reserve asset, its value crossed the psychological $100K level about two weeks back. However, Jerome Powell's subsequently making unfavorable comments about the Fed's ability to hold digital assets, and sounding hawkish on monetary policy did send prices lower. In such a context, while volatility risks should persist in the short term, this thesis aims to paint a bullish outlook for 2025 based mainly on demand-supply economics. Also, after recent comments by one of the SEC‚Äôs commissioners, there is likely to be a policy shift towards crypto which may enhance BTC's appeal and improve the tracking efficiency of ETFs investing in the digital asset. Changes in Crypto Regulations Could Benefit IBIT First, looking at the leadership change at the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission), the current Chair Gary Gensler is preparing to vacate his position. While he can be credited with approving several Bitcoin ETFs in January this year, this came only after he faced legal pressure. For this matter, a U.S. appeal court ruled in favor of Grayscale's application to convert its Bitcoin Trust into a spot ETF in August 2023, a move that was initially opposed by U.S. regulators. Therefore with Gensler's departure, there are expectations of a more supportive regulatory environment for crypto investments. This is especially so because Paul Atkins who has been nominated by President-Elect Trump as his replacement has experience in financial services including crypto and regulatory compliance since he served as one of the SEC's commissioners from 2002 to 2008. Also, he currently leads Patomak Global Partners, a financial compliance consultancy company, and is co-chair of the Token Alliance , an industry-led initiative of the Chamber of Digital Commerce. Since the alliance focuses on connecting crypto exchanges with blockchain projects, it shows Atkins' commitment to fostering innovation in the blockchain-based payment world. Tellingly, this is an area where the U.S. is behind other developed countries, and, in addition to providing more balanced regulatory oversight (in contrast to his predecessor), Mr. Atkins possesses the qualifications necessary for making sweeping changes. Thus, from strict regulation , regulators may be more open to deep crypto-related regulatory changes, a possibility supported by Commissioner Hester Peirce who indicated that under new leadership, the SEC may revise key decisions on crypto ETFs and in-kind redemptions . Well, these would allow ETF investors to redeem (sell) their shares for the underlying digital asset, for example, Bitcoin instead of going through cash. In other words, in-kind redemptions could enable the exchange of ETF shares for crypto, which could then be transferred to a wallet. This is also synonymous with more efficient transactions and eliminates costs (trading and taxation) associated with cash transactions for those wishing to convert their Bitcoins to ETF shares As a result, this can improve tracking efficiency or the degree to which an ETF's market price is aligned with its NAV. In this way, IBIT can track Bitcoin price movements more closely potentially reducing the 20% performance gap as shown below. seekingalpha.com Looking further, direct exchanges of ETF shares for crypto could potentially enhance liquidity in the ecosystem, in turn leading to lower costs for fund managers namely by avoiding the buy/sell spreads normally associated with converting Bitcoins to cash. Consequently, if these cost savings are passed on to investors, in-kind redemptions could lead to lower expense ratios, but this ultimately depends on the funds' structure and objectives. Volatility Risks are likely to Persist in the short term but Therefore, innovation, whereby Bitcoin is used for purposes other than storing value, can lead to more demand while in-kind redemption can increase efficiency gains in turn increasing the appeal of spot ETFs like IBIT. However, this cannot happen overnight or just by changing one rule. The reason is in-kind redemption introduces other challenges like having sufficient Bitcoin liquidity (compared to cash before), especially during volatile market conditions. The reason is a liquid market reduces the bid-ask spread and increases the efficiency of the trading experience each time there is a transaction, or a buy at the offer or sell at the bid. Also, for the mechanism to function well, the custody risks associated with transferring large volumes have to be addressed to avoid incidents like the Ronin Network hack (2022) involving $600 million worth of coins being lost. In the same vein, using blockchain and cryptocurrencies to allow people to transact directly should also incorporate risk mitigation strategies because of scams and hacks and millions of dollars of losses suffered. Therefore, it may take some time before crypto-friendly measures are implemented and in the meantime, due to high expectations, there may be further volatility, a possibility supported by the price situated below the 10-day moving average and the RSI of 55 being overbought territory at the time of writing (chart below). The momentum (www.seekingalpha.com) However, looking beyond the short term, as far as Bitcoin trades above the $80K break-even level, miners who are essential components of the ecosystem as the producers of digital assets should continue to stay profitable. Demand-supply economics is Favorable to Digital Asset Prices This suggests they can obtain relatively more cash per Bitcoin they sell on the open market to finance their operations, in turn allowing them to HODL or hold more coins in their treasuries, thereby reducing supply. Ultimately, this supports digital asset prices. On the other hand, Jerome Powell has said that the Fed cannot hold Bitcoins, which somewhat goes against Trump‚Äôs intent of creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve. This may have reduced crypto allure in the minds of some investors and possibly contributed to BTC falling off its mid-December peak of $106K. Another contributory factor that also negatively impacted the broader market is interest rates likely to stay higher longer in 2025 as the fight against inflation lingers on. This makes the cost of capital dearer for miners planning to refinance or invest in new and more efficient equipment. Thus, in case asset prices fall further, miners may be constrained to sell more Bitcoins, resulting in more supply and pressurizing prices. However, this is currently not the case with a top crypto analyst stating that the BTC market is increasingly dominated by the HODLing sentiment since miners believe its value will go higher. Now, in the rapidly shifting dynamics of the crypto market, miners HODLing their Bitcoins is key as it means less supply is likely to reach the markets, implying that as long as demand is sustained, asset prices could rise. To come up with an estimate, I consider that currently, Bitcoin hovers around the $96K level which is near my prediction of $95.4K calculated some six weeks earlier in my previous thesis on the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA: BITO ). At that time, I used a multiplier of 9.18%, a figure obtained after accounting for past inflows, liquidity conditions, and price elasticity. Again, using the same multiplier and incrementing BTC's current value of 96K by 9.18%, I obtain a target of $104.8K or roughly $105K. Making the case for an investment in IBIT, Amid Volatility Now, by holding Bitcoin directly, IBIT tracks the digital asset's price movements closely. Thus, its shares should also gain, but, this time, I multiply its current share price of $53.5 by 7.34% (or 80% of 9.18%) to take into account IBIT's approximately 20% of deviation from Bitcoin's price. Hence, I obtained a target of $57.4, which represents only a modest upside of around 7% but is justified because of the risks. www.ishares.com One of these could be momentum-related or failure to sustainably break through the key resistance level of $100K, thereby causing selling pressure. Second, Bitcoin remains rate-sensitive not only because higher borrowing costs impact the finances of miners as mentioned earlier but also because higher interests could shift investor mindset to becoming more risk-averse. Thus, they could dump riskier digital assets like Bitcoin alongside growth stocks like tech and flock to value stocks. Third, with the investment products around BTC growing in sophistication, hackers may be tempted to target more vulnerable components of the ecosystem including crypto wallets, and exchanges. Talking of exchanges, any occurrence of an FTX-style scandal can be highly detrimental to the trust factor. Fourth, any news update about Bitcoin used for illicit activities as earlier emphasized by Gensler may undermine regulatory efforts to bring changes, especially innovation. Still, we are at a uniquely favorable juncture for Bitcoin with a Republican- controlled Congress , increasing crypto ownership among Americans, ETF-led adoption, and strong network effects, implying the cryptocurrency can rise further. Add to this drastically lower Bitcoin issuance, or the number of units awarded to miners which has dropped to around 412 daily from 943 before the April halving, implying more scarcity. Equally important, a more favorable regulatory environment could increase the efficiency of ETF transactions and reduce costs. For this purpose, IBIT is already trusted by many who want crypto exposure but without enduring the hassles of direct ownership, such as subscribing to an exchange and owning a wallet. Finally, another advantage is it is managed by giant asset manager BlackRock ( BLK ) and comes with better liquidity and trading volumes given its sizable assets under management. This is more than 2.5 times higher than its two closest peers Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ) and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ) as shown below, making it easier for large investors to enter or exit positions. www.seekingalpha",IBIT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-12-28 05:47:25

Starting in 2027, DeFi platforms will have to collect user trading information, issue tax forms, and provide customer details like names and addresses. This rule is meant to make digital asset taxes similar to traditional ones. However, some experts worry that this could be tough for decentralized platforms since they don‚Äôt have centralized entities to collect this data. This change is part of the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, but it‚Äôs facing opposition from crypto groups. Why Experts are Against the Rule? Crypto industry leaders are pushing back against the IRS‚Äôs new rule that treats decentralized exchanges (DeFi platforms) like traditional brokers. Uniswap‚Äôs Chief Legal Officer, Katherine Minarik, and CEO, Hayden Adams, both argue that the rule should be challenged, with Adams hoping it will be rejected through the Congressional Review Act. Yep, @CampbellJAustin beat me to it.

Recent Reserves And Netflows Indicate Market Reversal,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/is-the-tide-turning-for-bitcoin-recent-reserves-and-netflows-indicate-market-reversal/,"Analysts from the market intelligence company CryptoQuant note that current patterns in Bitcoin (BTC) metrics indicate possible changes in market dynamics. Bitcoin Price Faces Short-Term Volatility After a period of steady decline, spot exchange reserves have experienced a notable uptick, reflecting an inflow of 20,000 BTC. This increase suggests that more Bitcoin is being deposited into exchanges, which often indicates an intention to trade or sell. This type of behavior may add further selling pressure to the Bitcoin price, which has declined almost 7% over the last two weeks, signaling a potential early sign of short-term volatility. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Struggles to Hold Ground: Another Drop Incoming? Simultaneously, netflows across all exchanges have turned positive, with a net increase of 15,800 BTC. This reversal from the predominantly negative trend seen in recent weeks implies that inflows to exchanges are now exceeding outflows. When combined with rising reserves, this shift strengthens the likelihood of increased trading activity or profit-taking by investors, according to CryptoQuant‚Äôs analysis. While the broader trend in the market has favored accumulation and self-custody, these recent changes may reflect a growing caution among investors, who might be preparing for profit-taking or bracing for a potential price correction. Furthermore, a report by Bloomberg highlights a key metric gauging investor interest in Bitcoin from South Korea, which has risen to a four-month high amid ongoing political turmoil in the East Asian country. Trading Volumes Surge As Political Crisis Unfolds Known as the ‚ÄúKimchi Premium,‚Äù this metric measures the price gap between Bitcoin on South Korean exchange Upbit and Coinbase. Recently, this premium surged to the range of 3-5%, indicating heightened demand from South Korean investors. Per the report, the political landscape in South Korea has been tumultuous, particularly following President Yoon Suk Yeol‚Äôs brief and controversial declaration of martial law earlier this month, which lasted only six hours before being rescinded. Subsequently, the National Assembly impeached Yoon on December 14, suspending his powers and elevating Prime Minister Han Duck-soo to the role of acting president. In a further development, the parliament voted to impeach Han as well, marking a historic first for an acting president in South Korea. These political upheavals have rattled financial markets, coinciding with growing economic challenges and increasing nuclear threats from North Korea. The South Korean won has also seen a decline of 0.35% against the US dollar. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Setting For a Big Move ‚Äì Breakout Or Downturn? According to Bloomberg, South Korea remains one of the most active retail markets for cryptocurrencies, with trading volumes on Korea-based exchanges often surpassing those on traditional stock exchanges. Ki Young Ju, founder and CEO of CryptoQuant, pointed out that corporate accounts are not permitted on Korean crypto exchanges, meaning that the vast majority of crypto activity in the country is driven by retail investors. The Kimchi Premium has become a well-known metric for measuring retail interest in cryptocurrency, and factors such as strict currency controls and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations have contributed to this phenomenon. At the time of writing, BTC is priced at $93,938, experiencing a 2.5% decrease over the last 24 hours, with its closest support level at $92,000 serving to halt additional declines for the top cryptocurrency in the market.

Yet, as the market matures, some prominent DOGE enthusiasts focus on projects with more tangible use cases. One such enthusiast is a prominent Dogecoin millionaire who is now betting big on a new real estate altcoin, PCHAIN , that promises to revolutionize the property investment landscape. This altcoin aims to democratize access to the $600 trillion global real estate market using blockchain technology to tokenize real estate assets. With the Dogecoin price struggling in recent months, top market analysts strongly believe this real estate altcoin could emerge as the next big winner, outpacing DOGE‚Äôs gains by Q2 2025. The Dogecoin millionaire‚Äôs move has sparked widespread interest in the crypto community, as this real estate altcoin presents a compelling alternative to meme-based investments. The altcoin seeks to bridge the gap between digital assets and tangible wealth creation by focusing on real-world applications. The Dogecoin Millionaire and the Quest for the Next Big Break in the Crypto Market This prominent DOGE millionaire turned a modest $10,000 investment in DOGE into over $2 million during its rally to $0.73 in May 2021. Riding on the enthusiasm of the ‚ÄúDoge Army‚Äù and tweets from Tesla CEO Elon Musk, this DOGE millionaire epitomized the kind of success story that draws many to the crypto market. However, since its peak, DOGE has faced challenges. Its price has fluctuated significantly, losing much of its momentum. For the Dogecoin millionaire, DOGE‚Äôs declining momentum marked the beginning of a new search for the next big thing break in the crypto market. The DOGE millionaire has identified a real estate altcoin, PCHAIN, with the potential to outpace Dogecoin come Q2 2025. PCHAIN is the utility token of PropiChain, a blockchain-powered real estate platform using cutting-edge technologies to revolutionize the real estate industry. Unlike Dogecoin, whose value is driven primarily by hype and social media momentum, this real estate altcoin is backed by real-world assets and an innovative ecosystem poised to disrupt the $600 trillion global real estate market. With the clock ticking toward 2025, this DOGE millionaire believes this real estate altcoin will live up to its potential and leave Dogecoin in its shadow. The Dogecoin Millionaire‚Äôs Reason for Betting Big on the Real Estate Altcoin While explaining the rationale behind his huge investment in the real estate altcoin, PCHAIN, the DOGE millionaire, said, ‚ÄúDogecoin was a phenomenal ride, but it‚Äôs primarily driven by hype and sentiment. I‚Äôm now looking for projects with real-world utility and long-term growth potential. PropiChain (PCHAIN) ticks all the boxes.‚Äù The millionaire has reportedly allocated about 50% of his portfolio to PCHAIN, which he believes positions him for significant returns by Q2 2025. ‚ÄúReal estate is a multi-trillion-dollar market, and tokenization is the future. I‚Äôm confident that PropiChain will outpace DOGE in terms of market cap and adoption by Q2 2025,‚Äù he added. According to analysts, PropiChain‚Äôs growth potential is significant, given the global real estate market‚Äôs size. By tapping into this massive industry, this real estate altcoin has the opportunity to establish itself as a cornerstone of blockchain-based real estate transactions, further reinforcing the DOGE millionaire‚Äôs belief in the crypto token. PropiChain Powering the Future of Global Real Estate PropiChain is revolutionizing the global real estate sector with state-of-the-art technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), the Metaverse, blockchain-based tokenization of Real World Assets (RWA), and smart contracts. The platform offers investors round-the-clock personalized support through AI-powered virtual assistants and chatbots, providing step-by-step guidance throughout the investment journey. These innovative tools ensure a seamless and tailored experience designed to meet each investor‚Äôs unique needs. PropiChain‚Äôs advanced predictive AI capabilities analyze market trends and dynamics to deliver highly precise forecasts. These insights empower investors with actionable data, enabling them to identify and seize emerging opportunities in an ever-changing market. This technological advantage helps users navigate the complexities of the real estate industry with greater confidence. Furthermore, PropiChain integrates the Metaverse to utilize virtual reality and 3D visualization for immersive property exploration. The Metaverse feature allows investors to virtually tour properties anywhere in the world, eliminating the necessity of on-site visits and making global property exploration more accessible. PCHAIN‚Äôs blockchain-powered tokenization of real-world assets represents a transformative shift in the real estate industry. By converting physical property assets into digital tokens, the platform facilitates fractional ownership, enabling individuals with small capital to purchase fractions of high-value properties. This inclusive strategy opens doors to premium real estate markets for a broader audience and attracts a more diverse pool of investors. In addition, PropiChain enhances operational efficiency through the use of smart contracts, which automate key processes such as property leasing and lease renewals. These automated solutions reduce reliance on intermediaries, cutting costs and saving time while increasing the transparency and efficiency of real estate transactions. PCHAIN‚Äôs innovative approach sets new standards for accessibility, efficiency, and innovation in the real estate sector. Conclusion The Dogecoin millionaire‚Äôs bet on PCHAIN for its potential to outpace DOGE in 2025 underscores the prospect and profit potential of PropiChain. The first round of the PCHAIN presale grossed over $1.3 million, while the second round raised over $500,000, a sign of investor confidence in the project‚Äôs potential. After this second presale round, the token price will increase from $0.011 to $0.023 for the final presale round. Join the PCHAIN presale now for the massive profit potential and to enjoy early access to the future of the $600 trillion global real estate market. Analysts project your $1000 early investment would yield over $315,000 by Q2 2025. The token is listed on CoinMarketCap , indicating the project is ready to take the crypto market by storm. BlockAudit , a top blockchain security firm, audited the project‚Äôs smart contract and found no vulnerability.

Bitcoin's 133% YTD performance and potential for further gains make it a compelling investment, despite its historical volatility and downside risks. The incoming Trump administration's potential National Bitcoin Reserve and favorable regulatory backdrop could serve as significant bullish catalysts in 2025. IBIT offers a convenient way to gain bitcoin exposure with lower transaction costs, and its growing AUM and trading volume reflect strong investor interest. Wall Street‚Äôs crystal balls are out in full force. With just a few trading days left in 2024, S&P 500 price forecasts are generally bullish (for the first time in three years) while prognostications for bitcoin are likewise sanguine. According to data gathered by Bitwise, the average 2025 price target for bitcoin is above $170,000. Of course, this is not as pure of a sellside look compared to SPX targets since not all of the big banks produce bitcoin forecasts and there are some small companies with vested interests in bitcoin growth also putting out forecasts. Still, it‚Äôs clear that bullishness around bitcoin remains in full force after a 133% year-to-date performance, making bitcoin the top sub-asset class of the year. I produced Seeking Alpha‚Äôs first analysis of the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) back in January. It has grown to become the largest spot bitcoin ETF. I was neutral on IBIT back then, but turned bullish in the second quarter ‚Äì that's when I bought the fund. While others have a much lower bitcoin cost basis, I see upside looking ahead to 2025 after the recent pullback from $108,000. 2025 Bitcoin Price Targets Andr√© Dragosch, PhD | Bitcoin & Macro YTD Asset Returns: Bitcoin Leads Goldman Sachs According to the issuer, IBIT seeks to reflect generally the performance of the price of bitcoin. The ETF enables investors to get exposure to bitcoin through the convenience of an exchange-traded product, helping remove the operational, tax, and custody complexities of holding bitcoin directly. IBIT has been the most traded bitcoin exchange-traded product since its launch, providing investors with potentially lower transaction costs. IBIT has grown massively from its January inception. Total assets under management is now $53 billion, with increased volume since the start of the fourth quarter. Its annual expense ratio is low at 0.12%, though BlackRock notes that after the 12-month waiver period that began on January 11, 2024, the Sponsor‚Äôs Fee will be 0.25%. Share-price momentum has been very strong this year, though there have been bouts of volatility and drawdowns that shareholders of the ETF needed to stomach. I expect more volatility next year. Of course, IBIT does not pay a dividend , but I recently pointed out that there is a liquid covered-call bitcoin ETF: the YieldMax Bitcoin Option Income Strategy ETF (YBIT) which I had a nearer-term hold rating on back when bitcoin was above $100,000 per token. IBIT is a risky ETF given its historical standard deviation trends, but liquidity is strong . Average daily volume is north of 25 million shares, while its 30-day median bid/ask spread is tight at just two basis points, per iShares. Turning to my opinions on bitcoin and why I‚Äôm optimistic about the world‚Äôs most valuable cryptocurrency, take a look at the below graph. After gold‚Äôs 2024 rally, bitcoin is just 11% of gold‚Äôs market cap. I assert that there‚Äôs a runway for bitcoin to approach gold in total value. If that were the case, then bitcoin could eventually approach the $1 million mark. That would take years, in my view, but we have seen that bitcoin rallies can be intense. Bitcoin Still A Small Asset Compared to Gold In Gold We Trust Report It‚Äôs important to be realistic about returns and volatility, though. While bull runs in bitcoin have resulted in thousands of percentage points of gains, drawdowns have typically been on the order of 70% or more. So, prospective investors must be aware of the significant downside risk that‚Äôs possible. Recognize the Risk: Bitcoin Drawdowns Have Been Intense Koyfin Charts A potential bullish catalyst in 2025 is the so-called National Bitcoin Reserve that could be put in place by President-elect Trump. As it stands, there‚Äôs an implied 58% chance that it will be created before January 1, 2026. That‚Äôs a key variable ‚Äì if it‚Äôs effectively constructed, then there would likely be added demand for bitcoin. High Hopes for a Bitcoin Reserve Kalshi With a favorable regulatory backdrop given the incoming administration and a new SEC chairperson set to take over in January, let‚Äôs also analyze historical seasonal trends. January has typically been a solid month for the token. The average gain since 2011 has been 12% with a median first-month return of 5%. Fifty-seven percent of Januarys have been up. For Q1 as a whole, it‚Äôs the only quarter with positive mean returns for each of the three months. So, seasonality is generally bullish right now. Bitcoin: Bullish Q1 Seasonal Trends Barchart The Technical Take With optimism on the sellside, a still-modest value compared to gold, some bullish political catalysts in the new year, and sanguine seasonals, the technical situation is decent. Notice in the chart below that bitcoin has pulled back from its all-time high above $108,000. The rally to triple digits came on weaker RSI momentum, which was a bearish harbinger. For now, I see support in the low $90,000s and just above $85,000. If it drops below those levels, then a retest of the March 2024 highs near $74,000 could be in play. But take a look at the long-term 200-day moving average ‚Äì its slope is positive, which shows that the bulls control the primary trend, Bitcoin turned extended versus the 200dma earlier this month, so I see the current pullback as healthy. Moreover, the RSI momentum gauge has not turned oversold, which is another sign that the bears have not gained a whole lot of traction. On the upside, if we take the $55,000 range from late 2021 through earlier this year, and add that on top of the $74,000 breakout point, then we arrive at a ballpark target of near $129,000. Bitcoin: Bullish Long-Term Breakout Targets $120-$130k Stockcharts.com The Bottom Line I have a buy rating on IBIT. I own the fund, and I see further upside in 2025. I encourage fellow investors and prospective investors to recognize that IBIT and bitcoin will likely be highly volatile in the next 12 months as macro news, namely concerning developments with the Trump administration, could be up and down. But with some upside catalysts next year and positive seasonals and technicals, the bullish factors outweigh the bearish risks.",BTC-USD|IBIT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-12-28 06:03:00
38214731,https://coinpedia.org/?p=399138,1735365851,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,Bitcoin Weekly Trade Analysis: Is BTC Price Set for a 20% Drop Ahead of Yearly Close?,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-weekly-trade-analysis-is-btc-price-set-for-a-20-drop-ahead-of-yearly-close/,"The post Bitcoin Weekly Trade Analysis: Is BTC Price Set for a 20% Drop Ahead of Yearly Close? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Bitcoin bulls have switched to the passive mode as they cannot exert enough pressure even in times of a drop in selling volume. This indicates a lack of interest among the market participants, as bears also remain inactive. In such a scenario, an extended pullback usually attracts buying volume and as a result, the last week of the year may attract another 10% to 12% loss, pushing the token under the bearish influence. The BTC trading volume has surged to some extent compared to the past couple of days, which suggests the volatility could pick up during the weekend. The star token continued to break the supports after failing to secure levels above the resistance, weakening the bulls to some extent. In such a case, the possibility of recovery could be only if the token manages to trade above the pivotal support of around $92,000, which may lay the foundation for the trade in 2025. The BTC price displays some possibility of a bullish rebound as it heads towards the lower support of the falling wedge. The two levels to watch at the moment are $95,767 and $93,211, which are the 50-day SMA & EMA, respectively, acting as interim resistance and support. Breaking any of these levels may have a huge impact on the yearly close, as a rise above the resistance could initiate an early breakout above the falling wedge. Besides, a drop below the support could drag the levels close to the support at $92,109 and collide with the descending trend line as well. The RSI is decremental, which indicates the trend could remain under bearish influence, activating the lower targets. Therefore, if the Bitcoin price fails to initiate a recovery to $100K during the weekend, a bearish signal could be confirmed with the support lying between $71,000 and $81,000 while long-term support being around $65,000. Hence, these targets could be activated only if the token closes the weekly trade below the pivotal range of around $92,200, delaying a new ATH for several weeks. Therefore, considering the current price action, it appears that the range between $80,000 and $85,000 could be a good buyback range, which could offer a good long-term opportunity for the Bitcoin (BTC) price rally.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-28 06:04:11

The filing includes products with 1x, 2x leveraged, and -1x inverse exposure to Solana futures. Thus, it will allow traders to benefit from both ‚Äì upward and downward SOL price movements. Volatility Shares Futures Solana ETF Come With Leverage Options Volatility Shares filed a futures Solana ETF with the SEC offering leveraged options allowing traders to bet on swing movements for SOL price in either direction. Basically, this futures ETF will allow investors exposure to Solana‚Äôs performance through futures contracts. The fund focuses on futures contracts traded exclusively on Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) registered exchanges. The ETF will mirror 100% of SOL returns by primarily investing in near-term and next-term Solana futures contracts. Moreover, to support this investment, the fund maintains collateral in the form of cash, cash equivalents, and high-quality securities. Thus, the futures ETF will provide investors with a structured approach and a regulated way to gain exposure to SOL price movements. It will also maintain appropriate collateral to back its future position. This is not the first time Volatility Shares is planning to launch a future crypto ETF. Previously, the firm played a significant role in pushing forward the Ether futures ETFs. Clearing Path for Spot SOL ETF? Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg‚Äôs senior ETF analyst, has weighed in on the recent filing for Solana (SOL) futures-based ETFs by Volatility Shares, calling it a ‚Äúwild‚Äù move. Balchunas pointed out the unusual timing, as Solana futures are not yet live, and noted the inclusion of a leveraged 2x product as particularly bold. ‚ÄúThis is hardcore,‚Äù Balchunas remarked. Balchunas further stated that the ETF filing marks the imminent launch of Solana futures and that this development could improve the odds of spot Solana ETF approval in the future. However, earlier this month, Balchunas had predicted that Litecoin and HBAR ETFs would get approval even before Solana ETFs hit the market. As of press time, the Solana price is trading down 2.87% at $184. Since mid-November, SOL has been moving sideways with other players like BNB Coin and XRP overtaking it in the crypto ranks. Market analysts predict a Solana price surge to $1,000 in the case if the US SEC gives a green light for spot ETF.
