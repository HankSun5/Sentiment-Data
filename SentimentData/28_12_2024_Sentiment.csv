This exciting possibility is capturing the attention of the crypto community, sparking speculation about its future success. DOGEN Rejoys Big Moment: Trump’s Victory Will Send It to the Moon Guess who is going to join Elon Musk’s moon mission soon? DOGEN, the boldest meme coin for alpha males, is gearing up for take-off as Trump's victory in the recent US election has the entire market euphoric about the prospects of cryptocurrencies, especially meme coins.

With these two icons fueling the fire, meme coins are set for a wild ride! DOGE Soars 130% in Just One Week!

Flex Hard, Earn Big – DOGEN is Your Power Move! Cardano's ADA: A Sustainable and Scalable Blockchain Platform Cardano is a flexible and scalable blockchain platform designed for smart contracts. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, competes with Ethereum's ETH. Users can store value, make payments, and stake on the Cardano network. Cardano uses the energy-efficient Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, unlike the energy-intensive proof-of-work model. It divides its blockchain into two layers: one for transactions and one for smart contracts. This enhances its ability to process up to a million transactions per second. Cardano tokens, introduced in March 2021, offer secure, low-fee interactions with smart contracts. This sets a new benchmark for blockchain efficiency and scalability. Given its technological advances and sustainable approach, ADA looks attractive in the current market cycle. Polkadot (DOT): Connecting Blockchains for a More Scalable Future Polkadot (DOT) is a decentralized protocol and cryptocurrency that enables secure communication between different blockchains. It allows value and data to be shared across blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin without intermediaries. Polkadot uses parachains to improve speed and scalability, processing more transactions than Bitcoin and Ethereum. The DOT token is used for governance and staking, letting holders participate in development and transaction verification. Developed by Gavin Wood, a co-founder of Ethereum, and launched on May 26, 2020, Polkadot aims to create more interconnected and efficient blockchains. In the current market cycle, Polkadot's technology and potential to enhance blockchain interoperability continue to draw interest. Conclusion In the current bull run, while ADA and DOT have less short-term potential, DOGEN offers massive growth. Designed for those seeking luxury and success, it expects 700% presale growth with potential thousand-fold returns. Following tokens like BONK, DOGEN builds a community of market leaders and offers real value through exclusive perks for early adopters.

SOL, the native cryptocurrency of Solana, is central to its ecosystem, facilitating transactions, running custom programs, and rewarding network participants. The coin holds value by underpinning the operation of the Solana network, allowing users access to a suite of projects.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) , market capitalization’s second-largest meme coin, posted 3% losses in the last 24 hours as the selloff took a sharp turn. Other meme tokens have traded along similar lines, further plunging market sentiments. In the last 24 hours, whales have offloaded huge SHIB tokens, pushing the asset further into the red zone. Crypto analytics firm Lookonchain flagged a huge sale activity. A crypto whale sold 250 billion SHIB tokens worth approximately $6 million, aiming to take profits before further damage. The trader’s SHIB portfolio stands in profit after scooping 15.28 trillion SHIB for $3.8K in August 2020. From that point, the meme coin’s price has soared following bull cycles and mass accumulations from the community. The whale holds $52 million worth of assets after raking in $109 million in profits. This transaction follows previous trends from other whales dumping the asset. On Dec 16, 43 billion tokens were transferred to an unknown wallet, raising community reactions. Meme coins are susceptible to high swings because of prices and market structure. Rally After The Storm Amid a downtrend, meme coins can spark a frenzy on a wider crypto bulk cycle. SHIB bulls remain optimistic for an uphill run, which U.S. institutional investors will likely spark . Before the dip, the asset soared above 90% since the United States elections. Market bulls poured funds into meme coins in expectation of easing regulations in the country, a catalyst to drive the next upward momentum. Similarly, institutional investors also moved assets to reposition ahead of next year’s projections. Crypto enthusiasts investinghaven explained the possibility of a turnaround on X (formerly Twitter). “$ SHIB: 2025 Price Outlook This chart shows Shiba Inu’s price could peak near $0.0000998 in 2025, while the potential low is at $0.0000234. The path to these targets may see volatility, but it reflects broader crypto market trends. Patience could pay off for #SHIB.” Another factor that could spur increased accumulation is the altcoin season . This is characterized by fund flows from Bitcoin to other assets in a cycle. Several analysts have tipped an incoming altcoin season this month as whales move assets to other assets. However, volatility remains a key factor, with recent outflows and dwindling sentiments.",Cryptocurrency|News|SHIB|SHIBA INU,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-27 22:09:15

Focusing on Ripple could be a concerning precedent for future digital asset regulations in the U.S. This battle between the US Securities and Exchange Commission and Ripple Labs is so important in the crypto world that many are concerned with the regulations by the U.S. government toward its digital assets. SEC’s focus on Ripple while overlooking bigger issues Fox Business Reporter Charles Gasparino was critical of other high-profile cases with Sam Bankman-Fried, but the SEC’s action against Ripple and its native cryptocurrency, XRP, got attention. Gasparino argues that the SEC is focusing on Ripple, which may be irrelevant, especially since bigger fish (Sam Bankman) are floating in the finance world. This case has gone far beyond Ripple and is bound to rewrite how the U.S. will continue to regulate its cryptocurrencies from now on. In an interview he said, Ripple Labs and Chief Executive Officer Brad Garlinghouse feel the SEC went too far. They consider the case filed in December 2020 not only an attack on Ripple but also on the cryptocurrency industry at large. Garlinghouse has also voiced his criticism of the SEC, arguing that the case will be a bad precedent for the entire industry. He further argued that the SEC does not know how to regulate cryptocurrency and that it does not appreciate the distinction between digital assets and others. Ripple vs. SEC Ripple reportedly stated its frustration at the SEC’s failure to provide clear guidance on what a company operating in the space of cryptocurrencies and related companies should do in the regulations. Ripple partially won in the court judgment made in 2023 since it ruled that XRP sold on secondary markets cannot be considered a security. The judgment separates XRP from other traditional securities transactions and brings great victory to Ripple. However, the court held that XRP’s direct sales to institutional investors are securities transactions, further pointing to the complexity of the case and the differing nature in which XRP is applied in different contexts. There is an argument that digital assets like XRP must be treated exactly the same way as the real securities inside, with general grounds that protect investors from fraud. Gary Gensler is the SEC chair then. Mr. Gensler maintains that the crypto marketplace should follow securities laws. To him, XRP, among others, has a duty to comply with securities laws for the protection of investors. In fact, the statements released by the company in 2021 have Gensler referring to Bitcoin and Ethereum as commodities but many other tokens and cryptocurrencies as likely being securities and therefore subject to the regulations. According to the SEC, Ripple sales of XRP should be considered securities, whether these are institutional or retail sales, and therefore fall within the same rules of sales that apply to stock and bonds. This being the case, the greater conversation is about how the US government should regulate cryptocurrency. Critics have pointed out the aggressive stance that the SEC has taken towards Ripple.

Ethereum: A Leading Proof-of-Stake Blockchain with Growing Potential Ethereum is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain known for smart contracts and a wide range of decentralized applications. It supports decentralized finance and uses Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon to improve transaction efficiency. Ethereum introduced ERC-20 tokens, which are used across various applications, but transactions still require ETH for gas fees. Since its launch in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum has evolved, transitioning to Proof-of-Stake with the Merge in 2022. The upcoming sharding phase aims to enhance scalability and reduce costs. Ether (ETH) remains central, facilitating transactions and rewarding stakers. Based on historical price movements and BTC halving cycles, Ethereum's price predictions suggest potential growth. These developments may make Ethereum attractive in the current market cycle. XRP: A Fast, Low-Cost Cryptocurrency for Global Transactions XRP is a cryptocurrency that operates on the XRP Ledger. It is designed to be fast, low-cost, and open. XRP allows for borderless transactions that are resistant to censorship and counterfeiting. It does not rely on a central authority, making transactions secure and irreversible. XRP was created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz. They launched it with a supply of 100 billion tokens. Ripple received 80 billion XRP to improve network liquidity and support the ecosystem. Ripple uses XRP to facilitate quick and efficient transfers across different currencies. In the current market cycle, XRP's technology and potential applications may make it an interesting option for global payments. Conclusion As the bull run unfolds, traditional coins like ETH and XRP show less short-term potential. Investors are shifting to DOGEN, a meme token for those seeking luxury and success. Expected to grow 700% by the presale's end with potential for massive returns, DOGEN builds a community of leaders and offers real benefits to early adopters.

The decision to extradite Kwon to the US rather than his native South Korea comes after Montenegro’s Constitutional Court dismissed the disgraced Terra founder’s appeal. Do Kwon To Face Trial In the US One of the most notorious figures in the crypto industry is set to be deported to the United States. The Montenegrin Minister of Justice, Bojan Božović, has approved the extradition of bombastic South Korean entrepreneur Do Kwon, the Ministry announced on Friday. “It was concluded that most of the criteria provided by law support the request for extradition by the competent authorities of the United States of America,” a translated statement from Božović reportedly said, according to news publication Vijesti . This follows a decision from the Constitutional Court of Montenegro earlier this week, which rejected Kwon’s appeal against a previous Supreme Court ruling. In September, the Supreme Court nullified Kwon’s deportation to South Korea and indicated that the Balkan nation’s Minister of Justice would make the final extradition decision. Extradition Nightmare Kwon founded Terraform Labs, popularly known for its algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD (UST) and its sister token LUNA. Both assets imploded in May 2022, wiping out over $40 billion in investor wealth overnight and triggering a chain of bankruptcies throughout the cryptosphere, before its founder went on a run from law enforcement around the world. He was arrested in March 2023 in Montenegro while attempting to travel to Dubai using a fake passport. Since being released from jail this March, Kwon has faced lengthy legal proceedings , with courts deciding between dueling demands to send him to the US or South Korea. The US has been particularly vocal in pursuing his extradition as it seeks to hold him accountable for his role in the shambolic collapse of the Terra ecosystem. Notably, in June, a New York jury found Terraform Labs and Kwon liable for fraud in a lawsuit brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The verdict included six charges, including intentionally misleading investors, misrepresentations about the success and stability of Terra, and “reckless” mishandling of customer money. In June, the controversial company and its once-fugitive founder were fined a whopping $4.5 billion by the SEC after reaching a “settlement in principle”. While it’s not the outcome Kwon was hoping for, signing the order to have him transferred to the United States should hopefully conclude the multi-year legal battle.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News|Terra|USA,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|LUNA|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-27 22:14:39

Make All Your Wishes Come True with the XYZ winning team! Solana (SOL) SOL has seen notable price movements recently. Over the past six months, it has risen by 34.50%. However, in the last month, the price has decreased by 19.60%, including an 8.97% drop in the past week. Currently, SOL is trading between $160.72 and $214.47, reflecting significant volatility. Technical indicators point to potential market trends. SOL is below both its 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages at $189.09 and $190.79, respectively. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 33.48, and the Stochastic oscillator is at 16.54, both suggesting the asset is nearing oversold conditions. The MACD level of -2.081 indicates bearish momentum may continue. Key support and resistance levels are crucial for SOL's price movement. The nearest support level is at $141.08; if the price falls below this, it could test the second support at $87.33. On the upside, breaking through the nearest resistance at $248.58 may propel the price toward the second resistance level of $302. This would represent a substantial percentage gain from current levels. Based on this data, SOL's price could rise if it surpasses resistance levels or fall further if it breaks below support levels. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum (ETH) has experienced notable price movements recently. Over the past week, its price dropped by 8.42%, bringing it within the current range of $2881.83 to $3892.12. The monthly change shows a smaller decline of 2.61%, and over the past six months, ETH has decreased by 1.57%. Technical indicators suggest potential shifts in ETH's price. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 26.14, indicating that the asset is oversold. The Stochastic value is 12.83, supporting this oversold status. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level stands at -33.83, which could signal a forthcoming change in momentum. Both the 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are close, at $3355.12 and $3400.11 respectively, hinting at a consolidation phase. Looking ahead, if ETH manages to surpass the nearest resistance level at $4504, it could aim for the second resistance at $5515, offering potential gains of over 15% and 40% respectively from current levels. Conversely, if it falls below the nearest support at $2483.85, the next support level is at $1473.56, which would represent a significant decrease. Traders are watching these key levels closely, as they may indicate substantial price movements in the near future. Kaspa (KAS) Kaspa (KAS) has been experiencing a noticeable decline in its price recently. Over the past week, the coin's value has dropped by approximately 10.7%. Looking at the monthly performance, it has decreased by about 23.9%. In the last six months, Kaspa has seen a significant reduction of around 36.5% in its price. Currently, KAS is trading in the range of $0.10 to $0.15, indicating a downward trend. The coin is approaching its nearest support level at $0.08. If the price dips below this point, the next support is at $0.0342, which could imply a further decline. On the upside, the immediate resistance level is at $0.18. Surpassing this could lead Kaspa toward the second resistance at $0.22, representing a potential increase of over 45% from its current lower range. Technical indicators suggest mixed signals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is around 30.8, and the Stochastic oscillator is approximately 10.6, both indicating that Kaspa may be entering oversold territory. The Simple Moving Averages for both 10 and 100 days are at $0.12, showing that the price is consolidating around this point. However, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level is negative at -0.001554, hinting at bearish momentum. Based on these factors, Kaspa's price could either continue to decline or potentially rebound if buying interest increases. Conclusion Though SOL, ETH, and KAS are promising, XYZVerse (XYZ), the pioneering all-sport memecoin, offers early adopters growth potential, blending sports enthusiasm with meme culture for significant gains.

38201138,https://zycrypto.com/?p=99437,1735337969,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor Pitches $280 Trillion Crypto Market Capitalization,https://zycrypto.com/microstrategys-michael-saylor-pitches-280-trillion-crypto-market-capitalization/,"MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor has proposed a new framework for digital asset implementation in the United States. This will usher in new growth, with surging adoption tapping an all-time high. Recent activities in the bull cycle have led to uphill projections, although price corrections threaten momentum. In a new document, Saylor rolled out a taxonomy and proposed rights and responsibilities for participants in the crypto space. Notably, this boils down to ramping up activity in the United States and becoming a leader in space. In the run-up to November polls, President-elect Donald Trump restated his stance on the U.S. becoming a global leader in blockchain, Bitcoin, and artificial intelligence. A New All-Time Market Cap? According to the document, US participation in the crypto market will strengthen its position and lead to fresh capital inflow. Specifically, the total digital capital market is estimated to soar from $2 trillion to $280 trillion, with US investors dominating the scene. Saylor asserted that this would strengthen the dollar and reduce the national debt. Following Donald Trump’s win, institutional investors recorded massive inflows, taking the market cap above $3 trillion. This pushed the price of Bitcoin above $90K and eventually tapped $107K as buying intensified. Although the market faced slight sell pressures, traders looked to pro-market regulations as Republicans control both houses of Congress. Inflows are expected to drive global adoption, taking the market cap to an all-time high. The main instrument for the upswing is a Bitcoin strategic reserve. Tipped by most stakeholders, it is expected to attract bulls and help the county lower its debt. US Senator Cynthia Lummis proposed a bill that will see the country acquire 1 million BTC per year to be held for at least 20 years. Lummis proposes selling gold reserves to fund Bitcoin purchases. Saylor also noted that digital asset growth without Bitcoin is expected to notch inflows. A Path To Clear Rules Although sentiments have largely flipped positive following the advancement of pro-crypto bills, much effort is still required to bring the US into line with other jurisdictions. Per the document, Saylor seeks a clear framework for issuers, owners, and crypto exchanges to avoid the plethora of lawsuits previously recorded. “ Path to Legitimacy: Establish a global, real-time, and uninterrupted process for issuing, trading, and owning digital assets by individuals, corporations, and machines. Issuers: Rights: The right to create and issue digital assets. Responsibilities: Ensure fair disclosure and ethical behavior. Exchanges: Rights: The right to custody, trade, and transfer assets between clients and other exchanges. Responsibilities: Publish asset disclosures, protect client assets, and avoid conflicts of interest,” the document reads.",Cryptocurrency|Featured|News|Michael Saylor|MicroStrategy,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-27 22:19:29

With the potential of Solana, the popularity of Dogecoin, and the rise of XYZVerse, these digital currencies might spark the next big movement by 2025. What developments could position them at the forefront of the industry's resurgence? Trump's Victory Sparks Crypto Chaos: $XYZ Meme Coin Ready to Deliver a 99,900% Knockout Donald Trump’s election victory has triggered a seismic shift in the crypto market, setting the stage for a bull run like no other. As the dust settles, major coins limp forward with uninspiring double-digit gains, while meme coins are stealing the show. PNUT’s recent 4,500% surge? FRED’s 6,000% explosion? Ancient history, buried in the ashes of short-lived hype. These coins buckled under selling pressure, leaving FOMO-ridden investors licking their wounds. But the crypto battlefield doesn’t wait for the weak — a new titan has emerged with plans to obliterate profit records and deliver an earth-shaking 99,900% surge. Take the XYZ Side - The Undisputed Champion of Meme Coins $XYZ Breaks into the Ring to Knockout Meme Coin Legends Meet $XYZ - the first-ever all-sports memecoins for true crypto degens hungry for 1000X profits. This is the token for those who thrive on the thrill of competition. As Trump takes the reins, the crypto market is set to erupt so the competition is getting fierce. Only the strongest tokens can survive in this no-mercy arena. Here comes the dawn of a crypto era for those with balls of steel — the guys like Joe Rogan and Dana White — who’d proudly rally behind Trump’s team. With such true men of business on board, there is no place for old pussy meme coins, it's time for real brutal coins. Fueled by the sports mentality, the $XYZ token has emerged as the ultimate contender ready to crush competitors and rocket to the moon on Elon Musk’s mission. $XYZ is on its way to the winner's podium to become a badge of honor for those who live and breathe sports and crypto. $XYZ Already Delivers Even Before Hitting the Market The $XYZ presale is underway, providing access to the token at a special pre-listing price. Launch Price: $0.0001 Price Now: $0.001333 In just a couple of months, $XYZ already soared over 1330%!

The $XYZ presale is already smashing through stages with the speed of a champion’s knockout blow. Join $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions! Solana (SOL) SOL has seen notable price movements recently. Over the past six months, it has risen by 34.50%. However, in the last month, the price has decreased by 19.60%, including an 8.97% drop in the past week. Currently, SOL is trading between $160.72 and $214.47, reflecting significant volatility. Technical indicators point to potential market trends. SOL is below both its 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages at $189.09 and $190.79, respectively. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 33.48, and the Stochastic oscillator is at 16.54, both suggesting the asset is nearing oversold conditions. The MACD level of -2.081 indicates bearish momentum may continue. Key support and resistance levels are crucial for SOL's price movement. The nearest support level is at $141.08; if the price falls below this, it could test the second support at $87.33. On the upside, breaking through the nearest resistance at $248.58 may propel the price toward the second resistance level of $302. This would represent a substantial percentage gain from current levels. Based on this data, SOL's price could rise if it surpasses resistance levels or fall further if it breaks below support levels. Dogecoin (DOGE) Over the past week, Dogecoin has fallen by 12.79%, extending a month-long drop of 20.41%. Despite this downward trend, the meme-based cryptocurrency boasts a six-month gain of 153.49%. This contrast highlights its volatile nature, offering significant returns over the long term even amid short-term losses. Technical indicators suggest Dogecoin might be oversold. The Relative Strength Index is at 28.36, and the Stochastic oscillator stands at 16.03—both below typical oversold thresholds. Additionally, the 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are converging at $0.32, indicating potential price stabilization or a reversal. Looking ahead, Dogecoin faces resistance at $0.48 and stronger resistance at $0.63. Breaking through these levels could signal substantial upside, potentially leading to double-digit percentage gains. On the downside, support lies at $0.18, with a deeper support level at $0.0257. If prices slip below these points, further declines may follow. Traders are watching these key levels to gauge Dogecoin's next move. Conclusion With SOL, DOGE, and the innovative XYZVerse uniting sports fans and meme culture, these coins are poised to lead the crypto market's surge into 2025.

Buterin’s Christmas gift will go toward upgrading the zoo’s facilities and supporting its Wildlife Sponsorship program. Crypto Meets Conservation In a letter addressed to Khao Kheow’s director shared on X, the Russian-born programmer explained that his involvement stemmed from a recent visit to the facility, where he was captivated by its commitment to animal welfare and community engagement. He thanked the zoo for welcoming him and highlighted Moo Deng’s unique role as a cultural ambassador for Thailand. Buterin praised the animal sanctuary’s efforts and reiterated the importance of improving the pygmy hippo habitat. He also acknowledged Thailand’s hospitality to the Ethereum community, especially during Devcon SEA in Bangkok last November. The 30-year-old said he would donate no less than 10 million baht, approximately $300,000 in Moo Deng’s name, to be delivered in two installments. The first contribution was made on December 26, with the date for the second set to be communicated later. Buterin has also promised an extra 88 ETH to ensure ongoing support for the zoo’s projects. Earlier, the establishment had posted on X expressing its appreciation for the Ethereum developer’s generosity, calling him “an adoptive father to Moo Deng.” He responded, sharing his enthusiasm for the role and quoting a popular line from the Star Trek shows: “May they live long and prosper.” Market Performance Moo Deng, already a beloved symbol in Thailand, gained global fame as the face of the MOODENG coin. The token has captured the crypto community’s attention despite recent market fluctuations. At the time of this writing, it was changing hands at $0.2693, with a 24-hour trading volume of $179.7 million, representing a 50.3% surge in activity compared to the previous day. While the token’s price dipped 3.2% in the past 24 hours, it gained 6.1% over the past week, outperforming the broader crypto market, which had seen a 1.2% decline in that period. Buterin previously liquidated over $1 million worth of meme tokens donated to him, including 10 billion MOODENG, giving the proceeds to various charities. Interestingly, he was recently critical of the meme coin space, decrying the proliferation of celebrity-inspired tokens. He argued that it would be better if they had a public goal aimed at promoting a specific cause or at least incorporated fun mechanics going beyond trading.

Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) PNUT is a fresh, meme-inspired cryptocurrency token making waves on the Solana blockchain. With a total supply of 100 million tokens, it boasts zero transaction taxes, a revoked contract, and a burnt liquidity pool. These features aim to ensure the security and safety of holders' assets. The token's mascot, Pnut, is a cheerful squirrel reminiscent of popular meme characters, adding a light-hearted and community-driven spirit to the project. For those interested, acquiring PNUT is straightforward through platforms like Jupiter Aggregator. In today's ever-changing crypto market, PNUT offers a unique blend of fun and practicality. Its presence on Solana means fast transactions and low fees, which could appeal to many users. The zero transaction taxes make trading PNUT more attractive compared to other tokens that have additional costs. While the crypto market is unpredictable, PNUT's engaging approach and solid technology might help it stand out among other meme coins. With the growing interest in community-focused projects, PNUT could be an interesting option for enthusiasts watching current market trends. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) PENGU is the official coin of Pudgy Penguins, a vibrant community that has become the face of crypto. From big brands sporting the Penguin to appearances in ETF commercials, the Pudgy Penguin has soared in popularity. With millions of followers and over 50 billion views, it's more than just an image—it's a cultural icon.

To surpass the S&P 500. The logic is as bold as it is simple: 6900 is greater than 500, so SPX6900 must be superior. This playful reasoning has caught the attention of many who believe that bigger numbers might just mean better investments. But how does SPX6900 fare in today's market? As cryptocurrencies evolve, meme tokens like SPX6900 are gaining traction. They offer a fun twist compared to traditional coins.

Its AI-generated concept has captured the imagination of investors and crypto enthusiasts alike. As the market seeks fresh and novel projects, Turbo Token's AI heritage could give it an edge over traditional memecoins. While the volatility of cryptocurrencies remains a factor, the blending of AI technology with blockchain might signal a new trend worth watching. Compared to other tokens, Turbo's innovative background may make it an intriguing option for those interested in the intersection of AI and finance.

38202219,https://invezz.com/?p=2407689,1735338403,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Pig butchering crypto scams cost users $3.6 billion this year,https://invezz.com/news/2024/12/27/pig-butchering-crypto-scams-cost-users-3-6-billion-this-year/,"Pig butchering scams were the leading attack vector for the cryptocurrency space in 2024, resulting in multi-billion dollar losses for millions of investors. According to data from web3 security firm Cyver’s annual fraud report, scammers managed to dupe crypto users out of a whopping $3.6 billion this year, with the attacks spanning over 150,000 addresses and 800,000 transactions. The number, while significant, presents a slight drop in losses compared to the previous year, when roughly $3.96 billion was lost to similar schemes. What are pig butchering scams? Often involving sophisticated social engineering tactics, pig butchering scams are long-term fraud schemes that thrive on emotional manipulation, fake credibility, and the promise of high returns, making them one of the most insidious threats in the cryptocurrency space. The term ‘pig butchering’ has been derived from the practice of fattening a pig before slaughter, similar to how scammers build trust and rapport with their targets over weeks or even months. Fraudsters approach victims in various ways. Sometimes, they pose as romantic interests, sometimes as financial mentors, and gradually coax victims into fishy crypto investments that are too good to be true. Victims are usually led to fake trading platforms where they often see manipulated dashboards that display impressive returns to gain their trust and encourage investments. Once the victim is fully invested, the scammer disappears with the funds, leaving victims with little recourse and often no way to recover their losses. However, in a rare turn of events last month, the Federal Bureau of Investigation recovered $8.3 million connected to a pig butchering scheme. The case involved the former chief executive of Heartland Tri-State Bank, who misappropriated $47.1 million in customer funds, which ultimately led to the bank’s collapse. With pig butchering scams becoming increasingly common, authorities all across the globe have increased efforts to track and dismantle these often large criminal networks. Earlier this month, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission in Nigeria arrested 792 suspects allegedly involved in orchestrating pig butchering scams. Cyber attacks on the rise However, pig butchering scams are merely the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the various types of threats that plague the cryptocurrency industry. The Cyvers report notes that hacking attacks targeting the sector jumped 40% compared to last year, with access control breaches and smart contract vulnerabilities causing the most damage. As previously reported by Invezz, a separate report from security firm Hacken also highlights a similar trend. Notably, the centralized finance sector was the most affected, with private key compromises and weak access controls emerging as primary vulnerabilities, contributing to 75% of all exploits in 2024. Besides the aforementioned schemes, phishing attacks remain another persistent threat to crypto users. Since cryptocurrencies are inherently digital and transactions occur entirely online, the ecosystem remains highly vulnerable to such attacks. Even though such losses have been steadily declining over the past months, the complex and stealthy nature of the attack makes it a common weapon in the crypto scammer’s arsenal. For instance, on December 26, scammers were seen exploiting Google ads to distribute crypto-stealing phishing scripts while mimicking the Pugy Penguins project website with the malicious content hosted on the Adloox tracking domain.

Shiba Inu (SHIB): Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Expanding Utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a memecoin inspired by Dogecoin but built on the Ethereum blockchain. Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi, SHIB started with a quadrillion tokens. Half of the tokens were sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin, who donated and burned large amounts, increasing SHIB's visibility. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB's Ethereum base allows for applications like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange. There are plans for a future NFT platform and a DAO-based governance system. This integration with Ethereum's ecosystem gives SHIB potential for broader utility. In the current market cycle, SHIB's developments may attract interest due to its expanding features. Conclusion Coins like SHIB may have less short-term potential, while Catzilla aims to bring financial freedom to everyone. Offering a 700% ROI potential during its presale, the token starts at $0.0002 and rises to $0.0016 over 14 stages. With governance features, loyalty rewards, and staking options, Catzilla invites enthusiasts to join its mission against crypto villains.

After the holidays, the asset manager becomes one of the biggest Ethereum (ETH) whales after copping 993,591.95 ETH. This is equivalent to $3.5 billion worth of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. BlackRock Benefits from Spot Ethereum ETF BlackRock achieved this feat through its ETH Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) with the ticker ETHA. As of December 27, the firm’s Ethereum holding represents 0.12% of Ethereum’s total supply. Consequently, BlackRock has risen to become the world’s 12th-largest altcoin holder. This marks a laudable feat for a firm whose history with Ethereum began only this year. Contextually, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot Ethereum ETF applications made by eight firms, including BlackRock, in July 2024 after a long wait . Ethereum Price Struggles Post-ETF Approval Since the approval of the funds, Ethereum has had a good time in terms of growth. In addition, Donald Trump’s victory in the last United States elections held in November also contributed to the price rally. At this writing, Ethereum traded at $3,313.42 after losing 1% of its 24-hour price gain. The altcoin has been stuck between critical psychological levels in the last few weeks. According to crypto analyst Rekt Capital, it has struggled to break above the $4,000 mark . The coin passed this threshold in the past and peaked at $4,077 on December 6. There are speculations that Ethereum could slip further down to the point of losing up to 10% of its current price level. BlackRock IBIT Records Largest Outflow BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF has also recorded a lot of success this past few weeks, although it hit a roadblock recently. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) recorded its biggest outflow just a day before Christmas. This coincided with when the United States spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded four straight days of withdrawals, with over $1.5 billion missing. On Wednesday, IBIT made headlines because of a large outflow of $188.7 million . This was the largest that the fund had seen since its inception. In the coming weeks, which coincides with Donald Trump’s entry into office, the outlook of these funds may improve.

Related Reading: Dogecoin 600% Rally Prediction Still On Track Before End Of 2024 — Analyst According to recent studies, historical price fluctuations show that the popular meme coin may experience another parabolic boom. Dogecoin has been notorious for its wild price swings, and many predict that the coming year will be critical to its progress. Historical Patterns Suggest Potential Gains Dogecoin has had a history of sharp price increases followed by declines. For instance, in 2017 it rose 210% prior to reversing, then suddenly jumped 5,000%. In 2021, it followed a pattern, initially rising 476% before a significant reversal that ended with an astonishing increase of 12,000%. Dogecoin is now up around 440% over the last year, but has lately had a 46% pullback. Analysts believe that this repeated pattern implies a potential significant rally. Dogecoin Bullish Forecasts For 2025 Many analysts have made quite optimistic projections on the course Dogecoin’s price might take over 2025. While some have ranged within $1 and $3, others have pegged it as high as $10. Investments CEO said in a post on Christmas Day that Dogecoin would repeat its fourth-year cyclical performance. At the same time, he said that the meme coin’s rise would be better compared to that of 2021. A MASSIVE rally is coming for $DOGE, MUCH bigger than the one in 2021. Are you prepared? pic.twitter.com/auBAw7XMMn — CEO (@Investments_CEO) December 25, 2024 Meanwhile, some likely involvement from Elon Musk may be another crucial point, who is probably going to have a key role to play in the meme coin community sometime in the next year. His influence will probably create just the ideal atmosphere for Dogecoin to reach new highs. According to analyst Javon Marks, Dogecoin may surge as high as 600%, reaching approximately $2.28 based on past trends and market behavior. He says that previous cycles have followed similar patterns, leading to huge price increases. Market Sentiment And Future Outlook Despite recent volatility in the market and some bearish pressures, analysts still believe in Dogecoin’s bright future. The cryptocurrency market has recently been very volatile, and yet most of the analysts still predict that when bitcoin will stabilize and start surging again, Dogecoin will be sure to do the same. More than 140% gain of the Dogecoin’s price, taking the currency above $0.8023 is predicted once bitcoin reverses its down move.

Cardano, which has a market capitalization of $31.4 billion, and Ripple’s XRP, with a market capitalization of $123 billion, could be planning to enter into a symbiotic relationship. Cardano’s founder, Charles Hoskinson , has aroused discussions about adding XRP to Cardano’s privacy-focused Midnight sidechain. XRP in Cardano’s Midnight? Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, has hinted at the likelihood of partnering with Ripple. He suggested that the Midnight sidechain focused on privacy could include XRP in the project. The discussion also covered Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin as a potential addition to Cardano’s ecosystem. Hoskinson also mentioned that he had been holding talks with Ripple CTO David Schwartz as well as the company’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse. “Dave Schwartz is a great guy. He’s a brilliant guy. It’s a lot of fun being in meetings with him, and I love to hang out with him,” Hoskinson stated. Ripple’s resilience amid its legal battles with the U.S. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) impressed Hoskinson. The court case between Ripple and the SEC started in December 2020. Through XRP, the SEC alleged that Ripple sold securities without receiving prior approval. In July of 2023, the federal court ruled that XRP is not a security when traded in public platforms, among other things. However, unfavorable penalties and appeal proceedings continue to exert regulatory pressure on Ripple. In a recent live stream , Hoskinson even boasted about how well the company is run to deal with lawsuits, delistings, and regulation. Despite setbacks, Ripple remains a key player in the crypto space. Hoskinson also discussed using XRP in Midnight. This sidechain is built to focus on privacy within decentralized applications. He also mentioned that Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin could work in many ways for Cardano’s ecosystem. Hoskinson’s Budding Relationship with Ripple The Cardano founder’s comments show a shift in his stance toward Ripple. He previously publicly apologized to the XRP community on November 10. Collaboration talks suggest Ripple and Cardano may align on privacy and smart contract innovations. Ripple remains a top crypto player. XRP is the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, with a $31.4 billion market cap as of Dec. 27 (CoinMarketCap). Despite legal challenges, Ripple continues to push forward with new initiatives. The discussions signal a potential alliance between Ripple and Cardano . This could create new opportunities in blockchain privacy and stablecoin integration if realized. Both sides remain in talks as they navigate the evolving crypto landscape.",Cryptocurrency|Featured|News|ADA|Cardano|Charles Hoskinson|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,ADA|MARKET|REGULATION|SPONSORED|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-27 22:34:38

Ethena (ENA) Eyes Breakout as Altcoin Season Approaches Ethena (ENA) is showing promising signs amid growing optimism for an upcoming altcoin season. Despite a recent dip of -12.95% over the past week, ENA has surged 48.75% in the last month and an impressive 83.34% over six months. The RSI stands at 28.24, indicating oversold conditions, while the stochastic at 6.97 suggests potential upward momentum. With the current price hovering between $0.81 and $1.29, breaking above the nearest resistance at $1.55 could open the path to the second resistance at $2.04. This move could represent a significant gain from current levels. The SMA for 10-days is below the 100-days SMA, hinting at a possible trend reversal. ENA might be poised for substantial growth. Movement (MOVE) Soars: Nearly 1000% Monthly Gain Signals Bullish Momentum Movement (MOVE) has soared nearly 1000% in the past month, showcasing strong bullish momentum. This week alone, the price surged over 72%. Trading between $0.57 and $1.11, MOVE is approaching its nearest resistance at $1.39. A break above this level could see it targeting $1.93, offering significant gains. The Relative Strength Index sits at 43, suggesting there's room for growth before hitting overbought levels. The Stochastic oscillator indicates oversold conditions, hinting at a potential price rebound. With the 100-day Simple Moving Average at $0.94, Movement appears poised for continued growth in the upcoming altcoin season. Conclusion SHIRO, ENA, and MOVE show promise but may have less short-term potential. Catzilla, the ultimate meme coin hero, offers a 700% ROI potential during its presale.

Emerging blockchain platforms are poised to revolutionize the market by the year 2025. This article explores the innovative technologies that are expected to drive the next significant surge in digital currencies. Delve into the developments that could reshape the future of crypto and potentially transform the global financial system. Graphite Token (@G): Powering the Blockchain That Could Topple Ethereum and Solana Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) have had their time in the spotlight. Now, Graphite Token (@G) is here, bringing with it the power of the Graphite L1 blockchain designed to make crypto simpler, faster, and more rewarding for everyone. Could this be the next big thing to follow Ethereum’s legendary 4,000X growth? The secret to life-changing crypto profits lies in spotting the next hidden gem before the crowd. History shows that early adopters of projects with real utility reap massive rewards: Solana started at $0.04 and skyrocketed to nearly $300 — a staggering +7,500%. Ethereum launched below $1 and climbed to around $4,000 — an insane +400,000%. The secret to their growth? Utility. The more people use them, the more valuable their tokens become. But times have changed, and these blockchains aren’t cutting it anymore. Discover SOL and ETH Challenger for 4,000X Profit Potential What’s Wrong with Ethereum and Solana? Older blockchains face growing challenges like rising fees, complexity, regulatory uncertainty, and questions about reliability. Take Solana, which occasionally experiences network outages, or Ethereum, which saw a significant reduction in its burn rate in 2024. Between unpredictable gas costs, unsatisfactory speed, and unreliable service, users are starting to look elsewhere. The dominance of the “old guard” is fading. What Graphite Brings to the Table Graphite is built to address the challenges of older blockchains with a set of practical features. Direct Rewards for Entry-Point Nodes Graphite has something no other blockchain offers. It lets entry-point nodes earn 50% of transaction fees passing through their nodes, so literally anyone contributing to its operations can earn a share. Transparent, Trust-Based Interactions Graphite’s reputation-based system introduces a Trust Score, a measure of user credibility similar to a credit rating in TradFi. This approach enhances transparency while keeping user privacy within the network where interactions are built on trust. Fair Fees, Fast Speed, and High Scalability Powered by the PoA Polymer 2.0 Algorithm, Graphite keeps fees plain and as low as possible by minimizing computational and energy costs. The network processes up to 1,400 transactions per second with confirmation times under 10 seconds, delivering a perfect balance of speed, cost-efficiency, and reliability. Security as a Top Priority Graphite enforces a one user - one account policy to safeguard its network against fraud and scams. Additionally, it offers an optional KYC verification procedure with three tiers of off-chain checks powered by ZKP to ensure compliance while protecting user data. With transaction filters, users can choose to interact only with accounts that meet specific KYC levels, adding an extra layer of security. Is This Your Chance to Get in Early? The Graphite blockchain is secure, transparent, scalable, and cost-efficient, making it the go-to choice for developers and users alike. With its practical approach and early adoption potential, Graphite is a project worth watching. For those looking to get in early, Graphite offers an opportunity to be part of a blockchain that’s designed for long-term growth and usability. Will it deliver 4,000X gains? Time will tell, but the foundation is strong. This could be your shot at 4,000X profits — Don’t miss out! ARB Token: Empowering Ethereum with Arbitrum's Layer-2 Scaling ARB is the token powering Arbitrum, a Layer-2 solution for Ethereum developed by Offchain Labs. Arbitrum enhances Ethereum by increasing transaction speed, scalability, and privacy. It uses optimistic rollups to improve smart contract performance and lower execution costs. ARB serves as a governance token, allowing holders to vote on network decisions and participate in ecosystem development. The initial supply is 10 billion tokens, with a maximum yearly inflation rate of 2%. Distribution includes allocations to investors, DAOs, individual wallets, a DAO Treasury, and the team and advisors. The Arbitrum DAO oversees any changes in token allocation. Solana (SOL): Exploring a Scalable Blockchain for Decentralized Apps Solana is a blockchain platform that focuses on scalability. It provides a foundation for decentralized applications, similar to Ethereum and Cardano. Solana stands out because of its architecture designed for fast transactions and flexible development across many programming languages. SOL is the native cryptocurrency of Solana. It plays a central role in the ecosystem. Users can use SOL to facilitate transactions, run custom programs, and reward network supporters. The SOL coin holds value because it underpins the operation of the Solana ecosystem. It rewards participants and allows access to various projects. Solana avoids sharding or second-layer solutions for scalability. Its high-capacity network aims to attract developers and investors by hosting high-activity products and services. AVAX: Avalanche's Eco-Friendly Blockchain with High Transaction Capacity AVAX is the native token of Avalanche, a Layer-1 blockchain known for its low fees and quick transaction processing. The platform uses a hybrid consensus mechanism that combines classical and Nakamoto principles, aiming to finalize transactions in less than two seconds. Avalanche features three interoperable chains—the X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain—that handle various functions like transactions and smart contracts. AVAX plays a central role in the ecosystem, used for transaction fees, securing the network through staking, and operating multiple Subnets. This utility supports payments, staking rewards, and the creation of custom tokens and blockchains within the network. Conclusion In conclusion, while coins like ARB, SOL, and AVAX show promise, they may have less potential in the short term. The Graphite Token (@G) powers the innovative Graphite L1 blockchain, aiming to simplify crypto and deliver unmatched speed and rewards. It tackles issues like Ethereum's high fees and Solana's network outages by offering fair transaction costs and a Trust Score system based on reputation. A unique reward model allows entry-point nodes to earn 50% of transaction fees, encouraging active participation. With strong security through Polymer 2.0 and optional KYC verification, Graphite sets new standards for blockchain reliability. For early adopters, it presents an exciting opportunity to engage with a project built for long-term growth. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

Winter Pepe (PEPEWINT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEWINT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Winter Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Winter Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Winter Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Winter Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Winter Pepe by entering its contract address – CUreLFB9SJmu6WEpotjmLJgt1khhdpneukDRJsbXFCGM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

In its 2024 Web3 Security Report, Hacken says that the theft of private crypto keys remains the most “significant” threat to crypto investors. According to Hacken, the number of smart contract exploits pale in comparison to how often private crypto keys are stolen. “In 2024, access control exploits – closely tied to private key compromises – accounted for nearly of total crypto hack losses, up from 50% in 2023. This translates to nearly lost across Web3, a sharp increase from less than $1 billion the previous year. 75% $1.7 billion In comparison, smart contract vulnerability exploits contributed just 14% of the total losses in 2024, underscoring the dominant threat posed by unauthorized access and private key theft.” Private keys are strings of letters, words, and numbers generated by crypto wallets used to authorize transactions and prove ownership. They help encrypt data and assets to protect them from being stolen. The cybersecurity firm goes on to note four reasons why people tend to get their private keys stolen – using an insecure management platform, being tricked by social engineering campaigns, insecure backups of data, and vulnerabilities within single-signature schemes of crypto wallets. According to Hacken, the largest exploit of 2024 was the hack of centralized Indian crypto exchange WazirX, which saw over $230 million worth of digital assets stolen. “Despite employing a robust multiparty security system, the exchange suffered a breach due to unauthorized fund movements from their wallets. WazirX utilized a Gnosis Safe multisig wallet requiring 4 out of 6 signatures for transactions. Five of the keys were managed by WazirX, while the sixth was held by Liminal, a digital asset custody provider. The attacker managed to manipulate the system, obtaining signatures from three WazirX signers and one from Liminal, allowing them to upgrade the wallet to a malicious contract and siphon off the funds.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Egrar Crypto, a technical analyst whose X account is followed by nearly 70,000 fans people, emphasized that Ripple could deliver much higher gains than Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH) during this stage of the bull market. #XRP – Will Outperform #ETH and #BTC – The Secret Is Under the Hood! #XRP Market Cap Window = $619.61B – $1.56T Ready How and Why. This post focuses on XRP's Dominance and its Market Cap potential, revealing why it has a much higher multiplier than both ETH and BTC.… pic.twitter.com/7CbaGlPxjr — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 25, 2024 He first shared an assessment of how XRP’s dominance has been evolving lately, moving from as little as 1% to over 5% in the past four years, primarily as a result of the legal victory that Ripple had in its case against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). He went on to predict that a break above the 0.5 Fibonacci level – typically interpreted as a bullish signal – could propel XRP’s dominance to 11.44%. Given that the combined value of cryptocurrencies currently stands at $3.28 trillion, that would mean XRP’s market value could be propelled to $375 million on short notice if that scenario unfolds as Egrar Crypto expects. This would result in 3X gains for XRP holders based on the token’s current market cap. However, Egrar predicts that the total market cap of cryptos could surge to $5.42 trillion once alt-coin season starts, meaning that reaching the 11.44% dominance level would mean a total market cap of $620 billion or 5X gains for XRP investors. Although past performance is not a guarantee of future outcomes, the trend for XRP dominance is currently on an upward path. If its ascent continues, these are plausible targets that could be reached in the medium term. XRP at $4 Before Year End is a Real Possibility From a technical standpoint, the $4 area is a feasible target that XRP could reach once the market shakes off the latest pullback and late buyers enter the scene to add more fuel to the rally. The post-election uptick that the crypto market experienced is interpreted by analysts as the first wave in what could be a prolonged climb for digital assets as multiple tailwinds including Donald Trump’s victory in the November U.S. presidential election and the Federal Reserve’s commitment to keep lowering rates are favoring higher prices for risky assets like cryptos. XRP has been the most favored asset of this rally of all the top 10 cryptocurrencies as it experienced a 253% uptick since a court of law ruled in favor of the company in its long-standing legal rift against the SEC. The robustness of the XRP network and the active involvement of its C-level officers along with a strong community of die-hard backers who have accompanied the project despite the many challenges it has faced could make XRP become a powerhouse in the cross-border payments, decentralized finance (DeFi) , and smart contracts segments. The launch of the stablecoin RLUSD is a step forward for the project to keep expanding its reach. During the latest pullback, XRP has found support at around $1.95 per token. This is the most critical area to watch moving forward. As long as it holds, it could serve as a launching pad once alt-season kicks in. The short-term target of $4 seems attainable and this would result in XRP doubling its market cap. However, the target shared by Egrar Crypto provides a longer-term view of the potential of this cryptocurrency to keep expanding its footprint in the crypto market.

Both said they would prefer to see how other countries – such as the USA – develop Bitcoin reserves before taking action. In Japan, the government issued a statement in response to a question from a lawmaker who suggested the state begin stockpiling BTC . And in Moscow, the nation’s Finance Minister stated that Russia would be “better off keeping” its “powder dry.” Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba (left), Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov (right); (Sources: Ogiyoshisan ;Kremlin.ru [CC BY-SA 3.0; CC BY 4.0] Japan, Russia: No Bitcoin Reserve Plans On December 11, the Japanese lawmaker Satoshi Hamada asked for the government’s opinion on his claim that “Japan should follow the example of the United States and other countries.” Hamada urged Tokyo to “consider converting part of its foreign exchange reserves into cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.” In a government release published on the Japanese House of Councillors’ website , Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’s office stated that it does not yet “have a detailed understanding of developments in the United States and other countries.” Ishiba’s office said that plans to roll out a national Bitcoin reserve in the US and elsewhere were “still in their early stages.” As such, the PM’s team said, it is still “difficult for the government to express a view” on the matter.

And the PM’s team wrote that existing foreign currency reserves are only “intended to stabilize Japan’s foreign currency-denominated assets and foreign currency bond markets.” The government added that the “volatility of cryptoassets, including Bitcoin,” made them “incompatible with the current system.” The Japanese media outlet CoinPost wrote that the “official response from Prime Minister Ishiba” once again “demonstrates that the Japanese government is maintaining a cautious stance” on crypto. Ishiba has made a series of cagey remarks on crypto adoption in recent weeks . These include non-committal and conservative comments on possible crypto tax reforms and Bitcoin spot ETF approval. The outlet wrote that Ishiba’s comments come “amid ongoing discussions both at home and abroad about using crypto as a national reserve asset.” No Russian BTC Reserve? Meanwhile, Russia’s RBC reported that Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told a student audience at the state-run Financial University that “the issue of creating a cryptocurrency reserve could be considered in the future,” but noted that the matter was not currently on the table.

However, there is also a risk of loss. So the state does not take those kinds of financial risks. Not at all. It is better to earn less, but keep – as they say – your powder dry,” Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov Siluanov added that despite the rapid growth in BTC prices this year, “cryptocurrencies are less predictable today than other assets.” However, he added: “Maybe someday, we will come around to the idea of [building a national Bitcoin reserve]. The Americans are talking about this now. They are talking about using crypto as a national reserve asset. But since crypto is a very volatile instrument, investing a sovereign state’s funds in something so [unpredictable] is probably dangerous.” Trump Ready to Act US President-elect Donald Trump has spoken about launching state-operated BTC reserve on multiple occasions. ‘Crazy worked just fine the first time’: Why some Republicans see Trump’s imperialist musings as an act of negotiation. https://t.co/WXlPZ4eDle — POLITICO (@politico) December 26, 2024 American lawmakers have already prepared the ground for this, crafting a bill that would prepare the legal framework for such a move.

This widespread dip in altcoin prices is largely tied to Bitcoin's dominance (BTC.D), which currently sits at a high 58.1%. What is BTC.D and Why Does It Matter? Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) is the percentage of the total cryptocurrency market made up by Bitcoin. When BTC.D is high, it means most of the money in the market is flowing into Bitcoin rather than altcoins. This often happens during times of uncertainty, as investors see Bitcoin as a safer bet compared to smaller coins.For altcoins to thrive, BTC.D needs to go down. A lower BTC.D signals that investors are moving funds into smaller altcoins, which drives their prices up. Historically, BTC.D starts to drop in the first quarter of a new year. When this happens, it usually kicks off an ""altcoin season,"" where altcoins grow much faster than Bitcoin.That means altcoins such as $WIF, $BONK, $ETH, $SOL, and $SHIB will likely start moving to the upside significantly. However, to maximize gains, it’s essential to pick the highest winners. Among the most promising winners for the upcoming altcoin season, experts highlight Altura ($ALU) as a standout project. Why Altura ($ALU) Could Be the Star of Altcoin Season One of the most exciting projects to watch during the next altcoin season is Altura($ALU). Altura is an AI-driven cryptocurrency that’s focused on revolutionizing the NFT and gaming world. By using artificial intelligence, Altura offers cutting-edge solutions that are catching the attention of both crypto and tech enthusiasts.Currently, Altura is only at a $100 million market cap, making it an undervalued gem. A 10x growth would mean reaching just a $1 billion market cap, which is considered achievable given the rapid growth of the AI and gaming industries. These industries are expanding at an incredible pace, and Altura’s unique role in both sectors gives it a strong chance to succeed.What makes Altura special is not just its innovative approach but also its potential for massive returns. Experts predict it could deliver gains as high as 10x to 20x for early investors. While other coins may also rise during altcoin season, they might not provide the same explosive returns as Altura . Its focus on two of the fastest-growing industries—AI and gaming—positions it as a leader in the space. Final Thoughts The current struggles in the altcoin market are closely tied to Bitcoin's dominance. As long as BTC.D stays high, altcoins are likely to remain under pressure. However, history shows that this trend doesn’t last forever. Once BTC.D starts to decline, altcoin season can begin, creating exciting opportunities for smaller coins.For investors looking to maximize their returns, keeping an eye on promising projects like Altura ($ALU) is essential. With its strong use of AI and its position in the rapidly growing NFT and gaming sectors, Altura could lead the next wave of altcoin growth and deliver impressive returns in the coming months. Its low current market cap makes it a prime candidate for explosive gains, offering a rare opportunity in the crypto market. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Currently, the Bitcoin price is retesting the support line of an Ascending Channel after crashing below $95,000. A crypto analyst has predicted that if it can hold this key support level, it could stage a recovery and skyrocket to its next bullish target, aligning with the upper resistance line of the channel. Bitcoin Price Retest Support Line; New Target In Sight In a chart illustrating Bitcoin’s price movement within an Ascending Channel, Trader Tardigrade, a crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), revealed that the cryptocurrency has temporarily declined below the lower support line on the channel. The analyst labeled this decline a “False Break,” highlighting that the Ascending Channel remains intact despite the drop. Related Reading: Ethereum Total Value Locked Reaches Highest Level Since 2022 After Crossing $90 Billion, Will Price Follow? As indicated by the red circle in the price chart, the False Break suggests that Bitcoin’s brief move below the support level was short-lived and does not confirm the continuation of its previous downtrend. Trader Tardigrade noted that after Bitcoin’s False break, the cryptocurrency quickly moved back into the Ascending Channel to reclaim the lower support line. Interestingly, Bitcoin’s drop below the False break comes as the pioneer cryptocurrency experienced a sharp price crash below $95,000. Lately, the flagship cryptocurrency has been under significantly bearish pressure, recording notable declines as market volatility intensifies. Despite this bearish performance, Trader Tardigrade has disclosed that Bitcoin is now retesting the channel’s support line again, aiming to break above and trigger a price reversal. The analyst predicts that if Bitcoin can hold this support line, it will likely continue moving upwards within the channel. Consequently, the analyst has forecasted that Bitcoin’s next price target would be the upper resistance line of the Ascending Channel. Looking at the price chart, the channel points upwards towards a range between $110,000 and $112,000. If Bitcoin can successfully recover toward the upper resistance line, it could signal the continuation of a bullish trend within the Ascending Channel. Additionally, a breakout above the resistance line could further validate the bullish momentum, setting up a stage for Bitcoin to potentially target higher price levels and possibly retest its all-time high.

According to crypto analyst Titan of Crypto, the Bitcoin price could see another decline, with the support level at $87,000 being the next target. However, according to the analyst, a drop to this price low could bring “maximum pain” to both short—and long-term investors. Nevertheless, Titan of Crypto believes this severe price decline could also present a strong foundation for Bitcoin’s next price rally. He emphasized that price movements are rarely linear, highlighting the crypto market’s inherent unpredictability and volatility. Despite Bitcoin’s bearish behavior, Titan of Crypto confidently predicts that a price rally to $110,000 is inevitable.

Cardano Price Outlook & Dogecoin Whale Activity Soar,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdags-whitepaper-v3-reveals-tech-progress-cardano-price-outlook-dogecoin-whale-activity-soar/,"As the altcoin sector braces for an expected $2.5 trillion surge, giants like Cardano, Dogecoin, and BlockDAG (BDAG) are picking up steam. The Cardano price outlook is attracting attention with a surge in whale activity as hefty investors scoop up 160 million ADA tokens following its recent slip to $0.91. In tandem, Dogecoin whales are tactically maneuvering through critical support levels, eyeing the $0.684 mark. On the other hand, BlockDAG, fresh off the release of its Whitepaper V3, continues to draw in crypto whales eager for the next blockbuster financial opportunity. The whitepaper sheds light on significant updates and strategic plans for BlockDAG’s tech through 2025. What’s more, this utility-centric project is causing a splash in the presale market, having raised over $173 million across 26 batches, rapidly closing in on its ambitious $600 million target. Cardano Price Outlook: Will It Breach $1 & Hit $2.27? The buzz around Cardano price outlook is growing as major investors accumulate 160 million ADA tokens post its dip to $0.91. After a 6% recovery, ADA now trades at $0.95, with forecasts suggesting it could rise to $1.2 soon if it surpasses the critical $1 mark. Looking further ahead, the long-term outlook sets a $2.27 target, making the $1 level crucial for upward momentum. Yet, the road to recovery for Cardano price outlook is not without its bumps. The drop in daily active users by 58% poses questions about lasting engagement. Furthermore, there are worries about its resilience in holding the $0.90 support amid market ups and downs. Can Dogecoin Whale Activity Push to $0.415? A recent update from @CryptoMichNL on platform X underscored that the “Altcoin market capitalization has beautifully retested and is set to climb to $2.5T.” This statement underscores the heightened activity across altcoins, notably Dogecoin, which continues to captivate due to significant whale movements. Currently at $0.348, Dogecoin Whale movements have maintained the essential $0.264 support level, targeting $0.415 and $0.684. While such whales frequently ignite price hikes, their influence brings about concerns regarding market equilibrium. Observers note that Dogecoin’s limited utility detracts from its competitiveness, and its volatile price trends cause hesitation among investors, highlighting the need for more robust fundamentals to sustain long-term growth. BlockDAG’s Whitepaper V3: Tackling Crypto’s Scalability & Privacy Issues The anticipated altcoin boom, projected to push the market to a staggering $2.5 trillion, has all eyes on ventures ready to lead this explosive growth. At the forefront is BlockDAG, a cutting-edge blockchain platform reshaping the crypto landscape. Having already amassed over $173 million by offloading more than 17.5 billion BDAG coins, BlockDAG has outstripped all expectations. Early backers have witnessed an incredible 2,240% growth in their holdings, as the price of BDAG coins skyrocketed from an initial $0.001 to $0.0234 in the current batch. BlockDAG’s recently launched Whitepaper V3 has enthralled both developers and whales, unveiling advanced solutions that tackle scalability, privacy, and compatibility challenges. It seamlessly integrates the UTXO model for private transactions and the account-based model for Ethereum-compatible smart contracts, creating an ideal platform for DeFi, dApps, and NFTs. The document also introduces the Phantom GhostDAG protocol, pioneering a partially ordered transaction system that slashes fees while safeguarding transaction integrity, setting a new efficiency standard in the blockchain arena. This innovation is igniting a flurry of interest among crypto enthusiasts, fueling a swift uptick in presale holdings. Market experts now believe BlockDAG could hit its $600 million presale goal sooner than anticipated. With BDAG coins in high demand, the ongoing presale batch is nearing completion, poised to trigger a sharp price rise in the subsequent phase. For those eyeing the best crypto project , the time to dive in is now, before the opportunity dwindles and prices spike. What is the Best Crypto Project? The altcoin arena is abuzz, with the Cardano price outlook hinting at renewed whale accumulations, and Dogecoin whale activity solidifying key supports. Yet, the spotlight is increasingly on BlockDAG, which is setting new standards with its latest Whitepaper V3 and impressive presale achievements. Having already surpassed the $173 million mark, BlockDAG is quickly nearing its $600 million goal. For those still pondering the next big crypto project, BlockDAG is emerging as a standout contender, offering unparalleled growth potential.

Trump Cyborg (TRUMPCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCYB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Cyborg launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Cyborg on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Cyborg by entering its contract address – 9yaNQ89EaQ2nEDczZpuTZfDwfiYCxbwSYC4JeiWLDE57 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCYB.

Sounds like a dream portfolio, doesn’t it? In the fast-paced crypto world, where fortunes can be made overnight, three names stand out: BTFD Coin (BTFD), Ponke (PONKE), and COQ Inu (COQ). Each is blazing a unique trail in the meme coin landscape. BTFD Coin has captivated investors with its massive presale success, Ponke is breaking boundaries with decentralised utility, and COQ Inu is charting new territory with cutting-edge interoperability. Here’s why these projects are the top new meme coins with 1000X potential. BTFD Coin: A Festive Presale Like No Other Let’s start with the hottest meme coin on the block—the BTFD Coin. Imagine an investment that not only promises massive returns but also rewards you with a 50% bonus just for getting in early. In Stage 13 of its presale, BTFD is priced at $0.000142 per coin, and with the BIG50 code, investors can maximise their holdings. This isn’t just a coin; it’s a movement. “ Buy The Dip ” isn’t just a slogan—it’s a strategy. The project is built on the principle that dips are opportunities, not setbacks. It’s no wonder BTFD has already raised over $4.6 million, sold 60 billion coins, and attracted 6,900+ enthusiastic holders. The coin’s Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, now in beta, is adding another layer of excitement. While rewards aren’t live yet, the gameplay is drawing attention from both gamers and investors. Add to this a staking system offering 90% APY and a referral programme that’s turning the community into a marketing powerhouse, and it’s clear BTFD is here to stay. To paint a picture, investing $5,000 at the current presale price would get you 35.2 million BTFD coins. With the BIG50 bonus, that jumps to 52.8 million. When the coin lists at $0.0006, your investment could balloon to $31,680. Joining is simple. Visit the BTFD Presale Page , connect your wallet, don’t forget to apply the BIG50 code for 50% extra BTFD Coins, and secure your investment before January 5, 2025. Act fast! Ponke: Utility That Sets It Apart Ponke is more than just another meme coin. With the launch of PonkeSwap, a decentralised exchange, it’s proving that meme coins can offer real-world utility. This move positions Ponke as a serious contender in the crypto space, appealing to both meme enthusiasts and utility-focused investors. Despite its innovative strides, Ponke has faced its share of challenges. After its Binance Futures listing, the coin experienced a short-lived surge, climbing from $0.44 to $0.55, only to settle at its current price of $0.32. While the volatility might deter some, it also presents an opportunity for those who believe in Ponke’s long-term vision. Ponke’s ability to adapt and innovate, particularly in the decentralised finance (DeFi) space, makes it a coin to watch. Its commitment to blending entertainment and functionality sets it apart in a crowded market. COQ Inu: Innovation Through Interoperability COQ Inu is rewriting the playbook for meme coins by integrating Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Token Standard. This technological leap allows COQ to operate seamlessly across multiple blockchains, making it more accessible and versatile than many of its competitors. Currently priced at $0.00000157, COQ Inu has seen a 15.74% price dip over the past week. While this might raise eyebrows, it’s important to remember that innovation often comes with growing pains. COQ’s focus on technological advancement positions it as a long-term player in the meme coin space. By addressing the interoperability challenge, COQ Inu is not just riding the meme coin wave—it’s leading it. Investors who value cutting-edge solutions in the crypto space will find COQ Inu’s approach both refreshing and promising. Turning Dips Into Opportunities The 1973 stock market crash taught us an invaluable lesson: downturns aren’t failures; they’re opportunities. Smart investors turned that chaos into immense wealth by buying undervalued assets. BTFD Coin embodies this ethos, offering a chance to invest before the next bull run. By focusing on presale opportunities, BTFD allows investors to get in early, maximise their returns, and ride the wave of its innovative ecosystem. Conclusion If you’re looking for the top new meme coins with 1000X potential , BTFD Coin is the standout choice based on current trends. Its limited-time 50% bonus, thriving presale, and innovative features make it a must-have for forward-thinking investors. While Ponke and COQ Inu bring their unique strengths to the table, it’s BTFD’s momentum and ROI potential that truly shine. Don’t miss your chance to be part of this revolution.

The Bitget Token ( BGB ) is trading at $7.37 at time of writing and is up nearly 28% in the past 24 hours and more than 70% in the past week. BGB’s gains partially materialized amid news that Bitget plans to merge the token with its other native asset, the Bitget Wallet Token ( BWB ). BWB, the 638th-ranked crypto asset by market cap, is down more than 4% in the past day but up nearly 45% in the past week. Bitget’s merger will unify both tokens under the BGB label. The exchange says the decision was driven by community demand. Explains Bitget chief executive Gracy Chen, “By merging BGB and BWB, we are taking a major step toward building a unified and robust ecosystem that bridges on-chain and off-chain applications. This move will enhance the utility of BGB, and ensure that every holder benefits from Bitget ecosystem growth.” Bitget says BWB holders on the exchange can automatically swap their BWB to BGB at a 0.08563 ratio, which the firm says was calculated using a 7-day average closing price of the BWB/USDT pair on Bitget. BGB is currently the 22nd-ranked crypto asset by market cap. The overall crypto market cap dropped by 4.7% on Thursday, according to CoinGecko.

As we approach 2025, investors and enthusiasts are keen to identify which cryptocurrencies will lead the charge. Here’s a curated list of the top five cryptocurrencies expected to make a substantial impact: 1. Qubetics ($TICS) Qubetics is making waves by integrating decentralised Virtual Private Networks (dVPNs) into its ecosystem. This addition enhances user privacy and supports various decentralised services, including DeFi, NFTs, and decentralised storage. Qubetics dVPN upholds the core principles of autonomy and decentralisation central to Web3 by ensuring secure and private connections.Currently, in Presale Phase 14, Qubetics offers a compelling opportunity for early investors. With TICS tokens priced at $0.037, the project has already raised over $7.9 million, attracted more than 12,100 holders, and sold 379 million tokens. The presale structure includes weekly phases with a 10% price hike, culminating in a 20% increase in the final stage. Analysts project a post-presale target of $0.25 per token, indicating a potential ROI of 563.81% for early adopters. Forecasts suggest that Qubetics could reach $10 to $15 after the mainnet launch, underscoring its potential as a top cryptocurrency to watch in 2025 . 2. Bitcoin (BTC) As the pioneer of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin continues to dominate the market. In 2024, Bitcoin experienced significant gains, surpassing $100,000 due to interest in spot Bitcoin ETFs, a supply-reducing halving event, and expectations of pro-crypto policies following political developments. Analysts maintain a largely positive outlook for Bitcoin through 2025, with varying predictions. Bitwise forecasts Bitcoin could attain $200,000 and potentially $500,000 if the U.S. government adopts a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Standard Chartered shares a positive outlook, while VanEck projects Bitcoin reaching $180,000 amidst significant volatility. 3. Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink’s decentralised oracle network is a cornerstone in the blockchain ecosystem, providing reliable real-world data to smart contracts. Its effectiveness in integrating off-chain data with on-chain applications has led to widespread adoption across various sectors. As blockchain technology continues to permeate different industries, Chainlink's role becomes increasingly vital, positioning it as a promising investment for those looking toward 2025. 4. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum remains at the forefront of decentralised applications and smart contract platforms. The anticipated full deployment of Ethereum 2.0 aims to address scalability issues, potentially leading to higher transaction speeds and lower gas fees. This evolution could further solidify Ethereum's position as a leading platform for DeFi, NFTs, and other blockchain-based applications. Analysts project that Ethereum could trade in a wide range, with a minimum price of $2,670 and a maximum of $5,990 by 2025, depending on market momentum. 5. VeChain (VET) VeChain focuses on enhancing supply chain efficiency and sustainability through its innovative use of decentralised technology. VeChain enables businesses to streamline operations and build consumer trust by providing transparent and tamper-proof data on products and services. As global supply chains become increasingly complex, VeChain's solutions are well-positioned to address these challenges, making it a cryptocurrency to watch in the coming years. Conclusion The cryptocurrency market is poised for significant developments as we approach 2025. Projects like Qubetics , with its innovative dVPN integration and established players like Bitcoin, Chainlink, Ethereum, and VeChain, offer diverse opportunities for investors and technology enthusiasts alike. Staying informed and conducting thorough research are essential steps for anyone looking to navigate this dynamic landscape and capitalise on the potential growth of these digital assets.

JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo – the four largest banks in the US – recorded $88 billion in collective profits in the first nine months of the year, the Financial Times reports , using figures from BankRegData. The banking giants now account for 44% of all the industry’s profits, and when you combine the “Big Four” with US Bank, PNC and Truist – the next three largest banks – the seven institutions are reaping 56% of all the profits in the field, up from 48% in 2023. PNC bank didn’t respond to FT’s requests for comments while the other six banks declined to comment altogether. Says Oppenheimer banking analyst Chris Kotowski, “Once you get much below the biggest banks, then it does become really hard to make the necessary investments and have the same name recognition… We’re a very mobile society, especially since Covid. Lots of people that move from New York to Florida for example, do you really need to have a different bank in Florida than you do in New York?” The consolidation of power by the biggest US banks highlights the struggle of smaller institutions to deal with regulation, volatile interest rates and the ability of larger banks to spread their presence digitally across the country.

Prince Elon (ELONPRIN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONPRIN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports.

Dogecoin Has Seen Positive Signals On TD Sequential & Whale Supply In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a Tom Demark (TD) Sequential signal that Dogecoin has just witnessed on its 4-hour price chart. The “TD Sequential” refers to a technical analysis indicator that’s used for locating points of probable reversal for any asset’s price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Tokens Have Only Been Getting Older This Bull Run, Analyst Reveals The indicator includes two phases, called the setup and countdown. During the first of these, the setup, candles in the price of the same color are counted up to nine. These candles aren’t necessary to be consecutive. When the nine candles are in, the setup is said to be finished, and the TD Sequential gives a reversal signal for the asset. Naturally, if the candles involved in the setup’s completion were green, the indicator would suggest a top, and if they were red, the signal would be for a bottom. As soon as the setup is over, the countdown phase begins. This phase of the TD Sequential works exactly the same as the setup, except for the fact that it involves thirteen candles, not nine. Once these candles have also been printed, the indicator gives another buy or sell signal for the price. Recently, Dogecoin has finished the first of these TD Sequential phases. Here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows this signal in DOGE’s 4-hour price: As is visible in the above graph, the Dogecoin 4-hour price has completed the TD Sequential setup with nine green candles, which implies the coin may now be set for a turnaround to the upside. This isn’t the only positive signal that DOGE has observed recently, as Martinez has pointed out in another X post that the whales have been busy purchasing during the last couple of days. The on-chain indicator cited by the analyst is the Supply Distribution from the analytics firm Santiment, which tells us about the amount of supply that any particular wallet group is holding right now. Below is the chart for the metric that specifically shows the data for the whale cohort, massive investors carrying between 10 million and 100 million tokens: From the graph, it’s apparent that the Dogecoin supply held by the whales has registered an increase recently. More specifically, the whales have added a net amount of 90 million DOGE (worth around $28.7 million) to their holdings in the last two days. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Bull Run Over?

However, for those seeking more affordable options with greater potential for growth, altcoins are an excellent choice. These alternatives to Bitcoin provide quicker transactions, distinctive features, and unique applications. They’re also within reach for those with smaller budgets, offering chances to achieve significant returns. Deterred by Bitcoin’s steep price or its uncertain future returns? What if you could invest just $100 and position yourself for considerable short-term gains? The strategy involves selecting altcoins that offer affordability, innovation, and solid foundations. Let’s delve into the altcoins with the most potential available now, including a standout project—BlockDAG.

Its development is grounded in peer-reviewed research, ensuring reliability and robust security. Its multi-layered structure promotes efficient processing and scalability for future expansion. The Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus model of Cardano drastically reduces its energy footprint, ranking it among the most eco-conscious blockchains. The Alonzo upgrade has broadened its capabilities, introducing smart contracts that facilitate DeFi, supply chain solutions, and more. 4. Ripple (XRP): Streamlining International Payments Ripple is modernizing international payments by remedying inefficiencies found in conventional banking, offering rapid and cost-effective transfers. Its blockchain solution is specially designed for cross-border payments, enabling financial entities to transmit funds globally in moments with negligible fees. Ripple’s extensive partnerships with banks and payment services globally showcase its potential to reform international finance. Despite legal hurdles, Ripple continues to focus on innovation and international growth, which could further elevate its use and market position with a positive outcome in its legal dealings. The Bottom Line Among altcoins with the most potential, BlockDAG is notable for its unique DAG-based structure, successful early sales, and the anticipated launch of its mainnet. These milestones position it well for both immediate profits and sustained development. To achieve a well-rounded crypto portfolio, mixing BlockDAG with cryptos like Toncoin, Polygon, and Cardano could optimize returns while ensuring diversification. With an initial investment of $100, you can begin assembling a collection of promising cryptos expected to yield notable outcomes.

In an interview with Anthony Pompliano, he pointed out that while the SEC was targeting Ripple, other high-profile figures like Sam Bankman-Fried were involved in serious financial misconduct without facing similar regulatory pressure. Gasparino argued that this was an example of regulatory overreach. He also said that Ripple’s technology, which underlies XRP, has potential but is now forced to operate overseas due to the lack of clear regulations in the U.S. The SEC’s legal actions have created uncertainty, and even after a judge made a decision in favor of Ripple, Gasparino criticized the ruling. “So they ( the SEC) bring the case, they get this judge who says, ‘Oh no, the investors, the retail investors don’t need the disclosure, they’re okay not disclosing to retail, but they should have disclosed it to the institution.’ This idiotic judge didn’t even know that she established precedent that there should be less disclosure for retail,” he said The judge had decided that Ripple did not need to disclose information to retail investors but should have disclosed it to institutional investors, a move Gasparino called “stupid.” He said that the ruling created a dangerous precedent for less disclosure for retail investors, explaining the mess that the case had become. Gasparino explained that his interest in Ripple began years earlier when he covered Ethereum’s efforts to establish its own regulatory framework, which led to a viral reaction after a clip of his reporting was shared by a Ripple supporter. Gasparino believes the scrutiny of Ripple and XRP seemed unjust, particularly when compared to the leniency shown to other figures.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-28 02:12:25

Top Crypto to Buy Now Amid Solana’s $776M Inflows and Ethereum Whale Moves What if you could secure your financial future by investing in the right crypto at the right time? With blockchain technology rapidly redefining our digital interactions, picking the top cryptos to buy and hold for the long term has never been more crucial. The latest updates on Ethereum and Solana are stirring the crypto market, but the buzz around Qubetics ($TICS) is stealing the spotlight. While Ethereum faces market tremors from whale activity and Solana demonstrates its robust market recovery, Qubetics’ presale generates unmatched excitement. This article will explore the developments of Qubetics, Solana, and Ethereum, helping you decide which crypto is the most promising to buy and hold for the long term. Qubetics: Transforming Web3 Privacy with dVPN In a world where digital privacy is constantly threatened, Qubetics ($TICS) is rewriting the rules. As part of its expansive Web3 infrastructure, Qubetics offers a decentralised VPN (dVPN) service. Unlike traditional VPN providers, which often track and control user data, the Qubetics dVPN relies on a peer-to-peer, blockchain-powered network. This decentralisation means no single entity can manipulate or monitor your online activity, ensuring true privacy and resistance to censorship. What makes this even more compelling is how it incentivises participation. Users who share bandwidth are rewarded with TICS tokens, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem. Enhanced security features, such as multi-hop routing and end-to-end encryption, bolster anonymity and protect sensitive data. This innovation makes Qubetics a standout among the top cryptos to buy and hold for the long term. Qubetics recently hosted an engaging AMA session, providing insights into their vision and addressing community questions. This transparent approach reinforces its commitment to building trust and fostering a loyal investor base. Solana: A Marriage of Innovation and Controversy Solana has made headlines for reasons beyond its technological advancements. Co-founder Stephen Akridge, embroiled in a legal dispute, faces allegations of withholding yield generated by Solana tokens during a divorce settlement. Despite this drama, Solana’s performance speaks volumes. With $776 million in daily inflows, the blockchain is cementing its reputation as a reliable platform for developers and investors alike. Boasting faster transactions and lower costs, Solana continues to attract attention as a leading competitor in the crypto space. It’s a testament to its potential for long-term growth, even amidst personal controversies. Ethereum: Whale Activity Sparks Investor Curiosity Ethereum, one of the most established blockchains, recently experienced significant activity. An ICO whale, known for strategic profit-taking, transferred 4,160 ETH—worth approximately $14.5 million—to Kraken. This move has raised concerns about potential selling pressure, which could lead to short-term price fluctuations. Historically, this whale has timed exits during market peaks, as seen with a $10.1 million sale earlier this month. Such activity fuels speculation about Ethereum’s immediate market trends. However, its long-term value remains undisputed, making it a staple in any portfolio. The Qubetics Presale: A Gateway to Early-Stage Gains The Qubetics presale is where the excitement truly builds. Currently, in Phase 14, $TICS tokens are priced at $0.037. With over $7.9 million raised, 12,100+ holders, and 379 million tokens sold, this presale has already captured significant attention. Investors are flocking to secure their share, knowing that each phase brings a 10% price increase, culminating in a 20% surge in the final stage. Missing out now could mean paying more later, making it one of the top cryptos to buy and hold for the long term. The momentum surrounding Qubetics is growing daily, driven by its unique use cases and token economics. Early investors gain financially and position themselves at the forefront of blockchain innovation. Will you be one of them? Conclusion: Which Crypto Should You Back? The crypto market is alive with opportunities, and each coin—Ethereum, Solana, and Qubetics ($TICS)—offers unique advantages. Ethereum’s proven history, Solana’s technological prowess, and Qubetics’ innovative dVPN service collectively highlight why these are the top cryptos to buy and hold long-term. Yet, the spotlight shines brightest on Qubetics . Its presale is a rare chance to join a project that combines cutting-edge technology with lucrative early investment opportunities. With price increases on the horizon, there’s no better time to dive in. Secure your stake in the future with Qubetics ($TICS), your gateway to blockchain success.

As part of its expansive ecosystem, Qubetics introduces a decentralised VPN (dVPN) service that aims to redefine internet privacy and security. Unlike traditional VPNs, which often centralise user data and risk breaches, the Qubetics dVPN leverages blockchain to decentralise operations. But what does this mean for users? The Qubetics dVPN ensures that no central authority controls user traffic, eliminating censorship and enhancing privacy. Its peer-to-peer network provides unmatched transparency and rewards users who share bandwidth with $TICS tokens. Imagine an internet where your privacy is protected, your data is encrypted, and you’re incentivised to participate. Could this be the future of secure browsing? Additionally, Qubetics has been fostering a stronger connection with its community by hosting an engaging AMA session . These sessions provide clarity, insights, and a sneak peek into their ambitious roadmap. With innovations like these, Qubetics is swiftly positioning itself as a top crypto to invest in. Bitwise Eyes New Horizons with Bitcoin ETF Bitcoin continues to lead the charge in crypto innovation. Bitwise Asset Management has recently filed for a new exchange-traded fund (ETF) aimed at companies holding substantial Bitcoin reserves. The proposed Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF will invest in publicly traded firms with at least 1,000 BTC in their treasuries. This initiative, detailed in a filing submitted on 26 December, includes rigorous criteria for companies to qualify, ensuring transparency and stability. By prioritising firms with significant Bitcoin holdings, the ETF aims to provide exposure to Bitcoin’s value while diversifying risks. This development underscores Bitcoin’s enduring role as a pillar of the crypto ecosystem. Arweave: A New Chapter in Decentralised Storage Arweave, the blockchain designed for permanent data storage, continues to make waves with its innovative use cases. Offering a decentralised solution to data archiving, Arweave ensures information is accessible and tamper-proof forever. Its unique permaweb structure increasingly appeals to developers and organisations seeking reliable and secure storage. This commitment to advancing storage technology positions Arweave as a noteworthy contender in the blockchain sector. As enterprises and projects increasingly demand decentralised solutions, Arweave’s relevance and utility only grow stronger. Qubetics Presale: Don’t Miss the Next Big Leap The excitement surrounding Qubetics’ presale is palpable. Currently, in Phase 14, the presale is structured to reward early adopters with significant price gains. Each phase introduces a 10% price increase, culminating in a 20% jump in the final stage. At present, $TICS tokens are priced at $0.037, with over $7.9 million already raised. This dynamic pricing model reflects the project’s growing demand and incentivises investors to act quickly. As one of the top cryptos to invest in , Qubetics offers a rare opportunity to get in early on a project with immense potential. If you want to combine innovation, community, and investment growth, Qubetics might just be the game-changer you’re waiting for. Conclusion: A Bright Future for Crypto Investors The latest developments across Qubetics, Bitcoin, and Arweave demonstrate the immense innovation within the cryptocurrency world. Analysts predict exciting trajectories for all three projects, with each catering to unique market needs. However, the standout opportunity lies with Qubetics ($TICS). Its decentralised VPN service, robust community engagement, and thrilling presale make it one of the top cryptos to invest in today. As $TICS tokens edge closer to their next price hike, the window for early investment narrows. Will you seize the moment and become part of Qubetics’ groundbreaking journey?

Instead, the market is moving sideways, hinting at a period of consolidation within an overall uptrend. At the time of writing, XRP is down by more than two percent and is trading at $2.17. Uptrend Still in Play Despite the current consolidation, the overall trend for XRP is still bullish. The price action looks like a temporary pullback, rather than the start of a downtrend. If the price continues to move upward, it could challenge its all-time high of around $3.25 to $3.30, which also aligns with a critical Fibonacci level. Holding Above the 2021 High A key point to note is that XRP is holding above its 2021 high of $1.96. This is a strong signal of market strength. Maintaining this level is crucial for XRP’s continued positive momentum, and as long as the price stays above this, the market outlook remains favorable. Short-Term Market Behavior: Triangle Formation On the shorter time frame, XRP is currently forming a triangle pattern. While triangle patterns can lead to breakouts in either direction, they are fragile and tend to be less reliable. As a result, there is a possibility of short-term bearish action, but the price could also break to the upside. Key Levels for Risk Management For traders, it’s important to monitor the key support and resistance levels within this triangle. The price must hold above the $1.95 support level to maintain the triangle pattern. If it falls below this point, the likelihood of a bearish move increases, and the triangle scenario may be invalidated. The $1.95 level is the key support for XRP and if the price stays above this, the consolidation pattern is likely to continue. However, if the price drops below this level, we could see a more significant pullback, with the next support areas being around $1.80 to $1.39.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-28 02:31:34

Winter Pepe (PEPEWINT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEWINT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Winter Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Winter Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Winter Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Winter Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Winter Pepe by entering its contract address – CUreLFB9SJmu6WEpotjmLJgt1khhdpneukDRJsbXFCGM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEWINT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-28 02:52:00

Lightchain AI, currently in its presale phase at just $0.003, is attracting significant attention for its innovative use of artificial intelligence in blockchain. Positioned as a promising project, its unique features and tokenomics set it apart from other tokens in the space. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu continues to maintain its place as one of the most recognized meme coins, with ongoing developments aimed at expanding its ecosystem. Both tokens offer intriguing opportunities for investors looking to capitalize on the next wave of crypto market growth. In this article, we’ll take a closer look at the potential of these two altcoins and why they are worth keeping an eye on. Lightchain AI: Redefining Blockchain with Artificial Intelligence Lightchain AI is changing the blockchain world by smoothly combining smart machines with blockc͏hain tech. As a fresh idea, it offers special traits that boost growth, safety, and speed, giving a new type of blockchain answer. With its smart machine-led method Lightchain AI can make tasks automatic improve deal times and fine-tune network work. Right now in its early sale phase at $0.003, it shows a good chance for first buyers to join in a project that mixes two of the most changing technologies. The money system and plan of Lightchain AI also show its power to make a strong mark in the crypto area. Shiba Inu: Riding the Meme Coin Wave with Continued Developments Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a meme coin that has been making waves in the cryptocurrency community since its launch in 2020. As a decentralized cryptocurrency, SHIB operates on the Ethereum blockchain and presents a fun and tongue-in-cheek approach to crypto investing. Despite its playful nature, SHIB has maintained strong support from its dedicated community and has recently made headlines with new developments aimed at expanding its ecosystem. This includes plans for decentralized exchange listings, integration with online gaming platforms, and partnerships with major companies such as Amazon. With these exciting developments on the horizon, SHIB continues to show potential for long-term growth. In addition, SHIB has also shown resilience during periods of market volatility. While other altcoins may experience significant dips in value, SHIB has managed to maintain a relatively stable price range. This makes it an attractive option for investors looking for a more secure and less volatile alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Which Altcoin Should You Watch? When deciding which altcoin to watch, two standout options in the current market are Lightchain AI and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Lightchain AI, with its innovative blend of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology, is gaining significant attention. Currently in its presale phase at $0.003, it offers investors an early entry into a promising project focused on improving scalability and security through AI-driven solutions. With a solid roadmap and unique tokenomics, Lightchain AI stands out as a long-term investment opportunity. On the other hand, Shiba Inu continues to be a dominant force in the meme coin space, with a growing ecosystem and increasing community engagement. While Lightchain AI offers a tech-driven approach, Shiba Inu remains a popular choice for those looking to invest in a recognized and growing community. But lightchain AI is more potential and more opportunities to grow.",Press Release,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|SHIB,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-28 03:00:00

This is evident in Bitcoin reserves on spot exchanges, which had been in a steady decline for weeks, now seeing a notable uptick with an inflow exceeding 20,000 BTC, according to CryptoQuant analyst IT Tech. Simultaneously, netflows across all exchanges turned positive, registering an increase of 15,800 BTC. These shifts mark a reversal from the consistent outflow trend observed in previous weeks, suggesting that traders may be preparing for increased activity on exchanges. Related Reading: Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Giving Potential Buy Signal, Quant Says Detailing The Increasing Exchange Reserves and Positive Netflows When Bitcoin reserves rise on exchanges, it typically signals an intent to trade or sell, introducing the possibility of selling pressure. Similarly, positive net flows indicate that the volume of Bitcoin moving onto exchanges is outpacing the volume being withdrawn. Historically, such patterns have often been associated with periods of increased market volatility. While the long-term accumulation trend remains intact, these new inflows highlight a short-term shift in sentiment, suggesting that investors may be positioning themselves for profit-taking or preparing for potential price corrections. IT Tech wrote: If reserves and netflows continue to rise, we could see increased volatility and potential downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price in the near term. This reversal highlights the importance of monitoring exchange activity for early signs of changing market sentiment. Another Bitcoin Metric Signalling Growing Buying Pressure While there have been signs of looming price action, another CryptoQuant analyst Burak Kesmeci has highlighted an opposite key observation: Bitcoin Taker Buy Volume on Binance has surged to $8.3 billion. This metric tracks the total volume of buy transactions executed by “takers” on Binance—market participants who purchase BTC at current market prices using existing liquidity. An increase in Taker Buy Volume is generally interpreted as a sign of heightened investor interest and growing buying pressure. Binance Bitcoin Taker Buy Volume Reaches $8.3 Billion! “We have observed that the Binance Taker Buy Volume has formed higher lows. This indicates that investor interest is increasing and buying pressure is strengthening.” – By @burak_kesmeci Link 👇https://t.co/axZopFuK0v pic.twitter.com/POtTGvcxrY — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) December 26, 2024 Kesmeci noted that over the past 60 days, Binance Taker Buy Volume has consistently formed higher lows. This trend indicates persistent buying activity despite occasional market corrections. Related Reading: BTC price is moving upwards on the 2-hour chart. Source: BTC/USDT on TradingView.com The sustained increase in Taker Buy Volume suggests that demand remains strong, potentially driving Bitcoin prices upward in the near term.

Just last month, Bonk caught everyone’s eye with its explosive surge, but it seems there’s a new player in town that’s stealing the show. BTFD Coin (BTFD), with its presale performance skyrocketing past $4.6 million and growing, is breaking records like it’s smashing piñatas. If you thought meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu had their moment, think again. BTFD Coin is proving that the best meme coins with 1000X potential aren’t a thing of the past—they’re just getting started. Over the years, meme coins have gone from a joke to some of the most lucrative investments in the crypto world. They’ve built communities, inspired memes, and, yes, created millionaires overnight. But here’s the kicker: BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme coin riding the hype wave. It’s shaking things up with a killer play-to-earn (P2E) game , a robust referral programme, juicy staking rewards, and a tight-knit community that’s growing faster than you can say “HODL.” It’s not just riding the meme coin trend; it’s redefining it. So, what’s the scoop on Bonk and BTFD Coin? Why is BTFD dominating headlines, and what makes it the hottest presale of the year? Let’s dive into this ultimate showdown of the best meme coins with 1000X potential and find out why BTFD Coin’s presale is your golden ticket to the next crypto bull run. Bonk: The Viral Star That Keeps People Talking When Bonk burst onto the scene, it felt like the early days of Dogecoin all over again. As the first Solana-based meme coin to go mainstream, Bonk gained traction thanks to its loyal community and unique decentralised approach. It was fun, quirky, and completely on-brand for what people expect from meme coins. Its interactive “pop-to-click” feature drew thousands to its ecosystem, making it a viral sensation practically overnight. But here’s the thing—as fun as Bonk is, its utility is limited. It’s like a firework show that dazzles the crowd but fades fast. After peaking at $2 earlier this year, it’s now trading at around $0.7, a sharp reminder of how volatile these coins can be. Analysts predict that Bonk could recover if Bitcoin rallies, potentially reaching $3 or $4 next year. But without significant updates or additional use cases, it’s walking a tightrope. Despite its shortcomings, Bonk still holds a spot in the hearts of meme coin enthusiasts. It’s nostalgic and taps into that community-driven ethos that made Dogecoin a legend. However, when you’ve got a coin like BTFD that’s smashing presale records, Bonk starts to look a little like yesterday’s news. Could Bonk reinvent itself and climb back up the charts? Sure. But for now, it’s more of a gamble than a strategic play. BTFD Coin: The New King of Meme Coins If Bonk is the cool kid everyone wants to be friends with, BTFD Coin is the overachiever breaking every record in the book. BTFD Coin has raised over $4.6 million in its presale, with 60 billion coins sold and 6,900 holders already in the mix. That’s not just impressive; it’s jaw-dropping. And the cherry on top? You can unlock 50% extra coins using the code BIG50. Seriously, who does that? But let’s not stop at the numbers. BTFD Coin has real utility, something that sets it apart from the pack. Its P2E game isn’t just a gimmick; it’s a full-blown ecosystem where players can earn while having a blast. The referral programme sweetens the deal, giving users a reason to spread the word and grow the community. Add staking rewards into the mix, and you’ve got a meme coin that’s not just for laughs but for long-term gains. Let’s break it down with an example. Imagine you’ve got $25,000 burning a hole in your pocket. At Stage 13, with a price of $0.000142 per BTFD Coin, you’d snag 176,056,338 coins. Now, hold onto your hat: when the presale price hits $0.0006, your investment will balloon to $105,633. Yeah, you read that right. That’s more than four times your initial investment. Talk about a glow-up. And we haven’t even talked about the community yet. BTFD’s following is growing faster than a TikTok trend, with over 6,900 bulls rallying behind it. This isn’t just hype; it’s a movement. Analysts are already predicting that BTFD could become the poster child for the next crypto bull run, and honestly, it’s hard to argue with that. Why BTFD Coin Is the Smart Play Right Now When you stack BTFD Coin against Bonk, it’s like comparing a Tesla to a tricycle. Bonk has its charm, sure, but BTFD is the complete package. It’s got utility, it’s got community, and most importantly, it’s got potential. The best meme coins with 1000X potential aren’t just about riding a wave; they’re about building something that lasts. And that’s exactly what BTFD Coin is doing. With its presale already past $4.6 million and a total of 16 stages, the opportunities here are as juicy as a summer barbecue. The BIG50 code gives you 50% extra coins, making this one of the most generous presale offers on the market. If you’re looking for a meme coin that’s more than just a pretty face, BTFD is it.

Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have tumbled, with BTC falling below 95K and ETH now down to the 3300 range. It has been over a month since Bitcoin touched 94K, and it continues trading in a range between 94K and 108K. Top altcoins are showing bearish momentum, with most coins down by 1% to 5% over the last 24 hours. The overall market cap has also dropped by approximately 2%, now standing at 3.28 trillion. Trading volume has seen a significant decline of 34%, as many investors are in a holiday mood and enjoying the last days of 2024. Market activity is expected to pick up after the first week of January when trading volume will likely return to normal levels. The Fear and Greed Index is currently at 51, indicating a neutral sentiment in the market. Crypto Market Today: BTC, ETH, XRP, and SOL Prices Drop Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, and Solana (SOL) have faced significant declines, mirroring the overall market downturn. The holiday season slowdown continues to impact trading volumes and prices. Bitcoin Market Today Bitcoin (BTC) price was trading at $94,327, down approximately 2% over the last 24 hours. Its 24-hour low and high were $93,440 and $97,429, respectively. Robert Kiyosaki has made a bold prediction , forecasting that Bitcoin will reach $350,000 by 2025 and urging investors to prioritize self-custody over institutional ETFs. According to SoSo Value , BTC ETFs saw an outflow of $367 million on Friday, with Fidelity accounting for $208 million of the outflow. Ark & 21Shares reported an outflow of $112 million, while data from BlackRock is still awaited. Ethereum Market Today Ethereum (ETH) price dropped by about 1%, now at $3,329, with a 24-hour low of $3,307 and a high of $3,441. The ETH ETF saw an inflow of $27 million yesterday, as Fidelity purchased $27 million worth of Ethereum. This shift in the crypto market today highlights the growing institutional interest in Ethereum. XRP Market Today XRP price was trading at $2.144 at the time of writing, down by approximately 2%. Its 24-hour low and high were $2.126 and $2.234, respectively. Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton has criticized a newly finalized crypto tax reporting rule issued by the Biden administration. Solana Market Today Solana (SOL) price was down by 2%, trading at $184. Its 24-hour low and high were $183 and $194, respectively. Coingape analysts reported the reason behind the Solana price dump . Meme Cryptocurrency Market Today Meme cryptocurrency market today is following the pattern of top altcoins. Dogecoin (DOGE) was down by 1%, trading at $0.3142, while Shiba Inu (SHIB) dropped by just half a percent in the last 24 hours. BONK, however, saw a 4% increase, with the “BURNmas” event contributing to the burn of over 1 trillion coins. Crypto Market Gainers Today Virtual Protocol Virtual Protocol (VIRTUAL) became the top gainer today, with its price jumping by 15% in the last 24 hours. Its 24-hour low and high were $3.05 and $3.58, respectively. Coingape analysts also reported the top cryptos to invest in for 2025. Bitget Token Bitget Token (BGB) price was up by 9% in the last 24 hours, trading at $8.36. The rise in price is mainly due to Bitget revealing plans for an $800 million token burn in the future. This development is affecting the crypto market today, driving positive momentum for Bitget Token. Crypto Market Losers Today FTX Token FTX Token (FTT) price was down by 16%, making it the worst-performing crypto in the last 24 hours. Its 24-hour low and high were $3.27 and $3.93, respectively. This decline reflects the challenges faced by FTX in the crypto market today. Zcash Zcash (ZEC) was down by 10%, trading at $61.72. Its 24-hour low and high were $61.61 and $68.92, respectively. This drop reflects the volatility in the crypto market today. Besides this, there has been no improvement in the hourly chart, and no major change in the price of top altcoins and Bitcoin in the last hour. Most likely, we will see significant price changes in the crypto market today next week, once the holiday period is over.

This move aims to provide investors new opportunities to leverage the Solana blockchain ecosystem. VolatilityShares Filled For Solana Futures ETF According to Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store VolatilityShares has recently proposed to launch a unique exchange-traded open-end index fund (ETF) based on Solana futures. As per the application, the proposed ETF will offer exposure to Solana futures with a variety of leverage options, including 1x, 2x, and -1x.

Something to watch as VolatilityShares pushed the SEC on ether futures ETFs. pic.twitter.com/lRs0XXMj5g — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) December 27, 2024 This diverse leverage structure is designed to cater to different risk appetites, enabling investors to potentially maximize their gains or hedge against market downturns. Solana ETF a Game-Changer? The proposed ETF will focus on Solana futures, trading exclusively on exchanges registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). This ensures a regulated and secure environment for investors, adding credibility to the crypto investment space. Solana, known for its lightning-fast transactions and low costs, has already captured the attention of the crypto community. If approved, this ETF could give investors a unique way to benefit from Solana’s growing ecosystem while catering to both risk-takers and cautious players. Volatility Shares Dual-Asset ETFs VolatilityShares is no stranger to innovation in the ETF market. The company previously introduced an innovative line of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that offer 100% leveraged exposure to two assets at once. This unique “one-plus-one” model allows investors to combine major asset classes like cryptocurrencies, stock indices, and market volatility in a single portfolio. The new ETFs include options such as BTC+ETH, Nasdaq+ETH, S&P+BTC, S&P+ETH, S&P+Nasdaq, and S&P+VIX, bridging the gap between traditional markets and digital assets.

Trump Cyborg (TRUMPCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCYB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Cyborg launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Cyborg on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Cyborg by entering its contract address – 9yaNQ89EaQ2nEDczZpuTZfDwfiYCxbwSYC4JeiWLDE57 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCYB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-28 04:12:00

Despite short-term declines, the cryptocurrency shows signs of stabilizing above a key support level. Recent Price Action Mirrors 2018 Trends Recent price movements have drawn comparisons to XRP’s behavior in 2018 when prices often surged beyond the upper Bollinger Band before retreating to the median line. XRP, which has dropped by approximately 5.18% over the past week, continues aligning with this historical pattern. Current projections suggest further declines could push the cryptocurrency to $2.103, a support level indicated by the lower Bollinger Band on the daily chart. According to data from CoinMarketCap, this would represent an additional 2.18% decrease from its current value of $2.15. Weekly Indicators Suggest Stabilization is Possible Despite these declines, the weekly Bollinger Bands present a more optimistic outlook. If the lower band on the weekly chart shifts upward, it could prevent XRP from falling to the grim $1 projection. This development would mitigate fears of a deeper decline and allow the cryptocurrency to consolidate above $2 soon. While uncertainty lingers, this potential stabilization provides hope for investors monitoring XRP’s performance closely. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Activity Signals Strength Amid Volatility XRP remains a key player in the cryptocurrency market, trading above $2 per token and holding the position of the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. With a market cap of $123 million and daily trading volumes reaching $4.67 billion, XRP’s activity underscores its resilience. These figures mark a significant turnaround compared to two months ago, highlighting how rapidly market dynamics can shift. While XRP’s current situation highlights opportunities and risks, its ability to hold above key support levels will determine its outlook. The weeks ahead will reveal whether XRP can capitalize on its current support level to mount a recovery or whether further declines are imminent. For now, market participants will continue to monitor the interplay between daily and weekly indicators to anticipate the next phase of price action. By staying above $2 and maintaining strong trading volumes, XRP is well-positioned to navigate this period of uncertainty, even as technical indicators point to potential short-term challenges.

Currently trading at $3,321, ETH’s resilience has been notable, especially amidst a broader market correction led by Bitcoin (BTC). This recent downturn has tested ETH’s critical support level at $3,290, effectively preventing a decline toward the psychologically significant $3,000 barrier. Could Ethereum Reach $14,000 By March 2025? Crypto expert Crypto Rover has made headlines with his bold prediction that ETH is poised for an “explosion” in the first quarter (Q1) of 2025. His confidence is bolstered by historical trends observed in previous Bitcoin Halving years, particularly in 2017 and 2021, where ETH experienced substantial double-digit increases from January through March. In 2017, Ethereum recorded impressive monthly gains of 31.9% in January, 48% in February, and a staggering 214% in March. Similarly, in 2021, ETH saw significant gains of 78.5% in January, 8.4% in February, and 34.7% in March. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reserve Idea Sparks Cautious Response From Japan PM: Report According to the expert’s analysis, these historical trends indicate that if Ethereum sustains its current price level for the rest of the year, it could experience a comparable path in 2025. Based on these historical figures and averages from the price increases between 2017 and 2021, it is possible that ETH might reach about $5,000 in January, around $6,400 in February, and by March, it could soar to $14,336 per token. Such increases would not only signify a recovery but also potentially triple Ethereum’s all-time high of $4,878 reached in November 2021. Beyond Ethereum, other altcoins such as XRP, Solana (SOL), Binance Coin (BNB), and even meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) are also expected to benefit from this market correction and consolidation. Crypto Rover has also cautioned altcoin holders, stating, “Now is the worst time to sell. Our portfolios still have the potential to do a 10x from here. The next three months are going to be incredible.” Key Support Levels For ETH’s Price In addition to these bullish predictions, analyst Gabriel Maur has weighed in on Ethereum’s current price action, emphasizing key support levels between $2,800 and $2,900. The analyst notes that the structure of support has transitioned into resistance, which, once broken, becomes a crucial support level. The upward trend indicated by the 55-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) further supports the bullish sentiment. Related Reading: Bitcoin $90K Level Is Crucial For Bulls – Price Could Tag $79K If BTC Loses It As long as ETH remains above this critical support region on weekly closes, the probability of continued upward momentum stays in favor of buyers. Maur identifies imminent targets of $4,093 and $4,868 (the previous all-time high), suggesting that if ETH closes above its all-time high, it may enter a price discovery phase with Fibonacci extensions indicating further upside potential.

This growth has reinforced investor confidence in cryptocurrencies and paved the way for broader acceptance within the financial markets. As institutional adoption gains momentum, the cryptocurrency landscape is set to evolve further. Bitcoin’s remarkable performance in 2024 has left a lasting impression on the financial world. This development has sparked renewed interest among both seasoned investors and newcomers eager to explore the cryptocurrency market.

Bitcoin’s Impact on the Financial Market The surge of Bitcoin in 2024 has undeniably shifted the dynamics of the financial market. By outperforming traditional assets such as stocks and gold, Bitcoin has proven its worth as a reliable investment option amidst economic uncertainty. This shift can be attributed to several factors, including growing institutional adoption and enhanced regulatory clarity, which have collectively bolstered investor confidence. Institutional investors, who were once skeptical of cryptocurrencies, are now showing increased interest in Bitcoin due to its potential for high returns. The presence of big players in the market has not only legitimized Bitcoin but has also provided a much-needed boost to its liquidity. Furthermore, clearer regulatory frameworks have alleviated some of the concerns surrounding security and legality, making it easier for investors to participate in the crypto market. This shift towards Bitcoin is indicative of a broader trend where digital currencies are becoming integral to diversified investment portfolios. As traditional financial institutions begin to embrace cryptocurrencies , people can expect further integration and acceptance within mainstream finance. This evolution is poised to redefine how people perceive and interact with money in the years to come. Cryptocurrency in Mainstream Finance The increasing acceptance of cryptocurrencies in mainstream finance marks a pivotal moment for digital currencies. In 2024 alone, several key developments have accelerated this trend. Notable among these is the integration of cryptocurrencies into payment systems by major corporations, enhancing their usability for everyday transactions. This mainstream acceptance is further underscored by the introduction of crypto-based financial products such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which provide a bridge between traditional finance and digital assets. These products offer retail investors easier access to cryptocurrencies without needing to directly purchase or manage them. As awareness grows, more individuals are likely to consider incorporating digital assets into their investment strategies. As cryptocurrencies become more embedded within conventional financial systems, their role as legitimate assets continues to solidify. This transition reflects changing consumer preferences and technological advancements that favor decentralized financial solutions over centralized ones. Future Outlook for Cryptocurrencies Looking ahead to 2025, there are both challenges and opportunities awaiting cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and altcoins. Technological advancements will continue driving innovation within blockchain networks while also addressing scalability issues that currently limit widespread adoption. Regulatory developments will play a crucial role in shaping future trends across global markets. However, greater transparency could lead to increased acceptance among regulators worldwide – ultimately benefiting long-term growth prospects within this dynamic industry sector. The convergence between technology companies investing heavily into blockchain research alongside existing financial institutions exploring new avenues presents exciting possibilities moving forward, bringing the world closer to realizing the full potential inherent within decentralized finance ecosystems today.

Del Mar Energy Inc. has patented a new technology,https://timestabloid.com/a-new-kind-of-alternative-energy-source-del-mar-energy-inc-has-patented-a-new-technology/,"Del Mar Energy Inc., a recognized leader in advanced energy technologies, has made a significant scientific breakthrough by proposing an innovative approach to energy generation that has the potential to fundamentally change the current energy paradigm. The developed methodology not only solves the problem of global energy supply, but also helps minimize environmental risks associated with traditional energy sources. The company’s key innovation is based on the use of piezoactive materials – complex composites that have the ability to convert mechanical vibrations into electric current. What makes the approach unique is the versatility of the technology, which allows energy to be extracted from a wide range of mechanical influences such as vehicle vibrations, acoustic waves and even human movement. This wide range of applications makes piezoactive materials a promising tool for energy systems of different scales – from stand-alone devices to large infrastructure facilities. At the official presentation, Del Mar Energy Inc.’s CEO, Michael Lattema, emphasized the strategic importance of the development, “We stand at the threshold of a new technological era. Our achievements are not only a scientific breakthrough, but also an opportunity to rethink the role of energy in ensuring the sustainable development of society”. One of the key characteristics of the new technology is its environmental neutrality. The process of producing and using piezoactive materials minimizes dependence on rare earth elements, which helps reduce the carbon footprint and vulnerability of global supply chains. In addition, an energy generation system based on these materials creates virtually no waste, making it environmentally friendly. Potential applications of the technology are already being actively discussed in expert circles. For example, it is proposed to use piezoactive materials in road surfaces, where energy can be generated by mechanical effects from vehicle traffic. Additionally, research is underway to integrate the technology into the architecture of energy-efficient buildings, which could partially power themselves through vibrations caused by wind loads or operational activity. Renewable energy experts praise the potential of this invention. Edward Hoffman, a professor of energy systems at Harvard University, said, “The technology proposed by Del Mar Energy Inc. opens new perspectives for the transition to sustainable energy. If it can be scaled and integrated into existing infrastructure, it will significantly reduce dependence on fossil fuels.” The company intends to launch pilot projects in three key markets – North America, Europe and Asia. Successful completion of testing will pave the way for mass adoption of the technology in the coming decades. Del Mar Energy Inc. estimates that their development will become an integral element of the global energy system based on the principles of sustainability and efficiency. Del Mar Energy Inc.’s achievement represents an outstanding example of the synergy of scientific research and innovative technologies aimed at solving global challenges. The company encourages the international community of scientists and engineers to collaborate to create an energy ecosystem capable of ensuring a sustainable future for all.

38213127,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376077,1735362611,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/38213127.jpeg,The Top 100 Crypto Assets’ 6 Best Performers in 2024,https://cryptopotato.com/the-top-100-crypto-assets-6-best-performers-in-2024/,"Altcoins include all the other Internet currencies secured by cryptographic blockchains, in addition to Bitcoin, which is a seminal and first-in-class cryptocurrency. Their currency market exchange rates can vary with as much volatility as BTC and tend to track along with Bitcoin’s price. In fact, big rallies for BTC tend to lead to major bull runs in altcoin markets as well. Seasoned crypto day and swing traders refer to these movements as “alt season.” While Bitcoin posted a price gain of 121% from New Year’s Day to Christmas Eve this year, the following six altcoins saw increases ranging from 1,249% to a staggering 1.84 million percent for a latecomer to altcoin markets this year that only launched in October. Lower down in this article is the entire list of top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap ranked in order of gains they delivered from Jan. 1 through Dec. 24 this year. The author calculated these gains by taking the average crypto exchange price on Dec. 24 and dividing it by the average price on Jan. 1. Accordingly, some coins may be more or less profitable to day trade or swing trade than they appear on this list due to their market movements between the beginning and end dates for this calculation. Several of these coins would show much higher percentage gains if the end date were calculated from price peaks that happened earlier in the year. But here are the six that did best for investors who dollar cost average or hold long term. 1. Fartcoin Blew Investors Away This Year Fartcoin now valued at $1.2 Billion – what an explosion! pic.twitter.com/q53MnDbJwh — Barchart (@Barchart) December 24, 2024 The silent but violent creeper rally for Fartcoin blew away crypto markets this year. This hot meme coin is a fresh one. It began to rally right out the gate following its launch in mid-October. Following the November election, however, this Solana Program Library meme coin really ripped. Trump’s reelection saw most crypto markets rally, but Fartcoin posted a 300% gain in a matter of days from Nov. 5 through Nov. 18. Then in December, Fartcoin took another leg up to above $1 by Dec. 19. Now, Fartcoin is poised to run to $2 per token on popular Solana decentralized exchanges (DEX) like Radium and Meteroa VD. What could be behind such a hilarious meme economy? Perhaps it has something to do with the name Trump being a traditional slang term for a—well for—a Bronx cheer. In addition, this meme coin is the latest demonstration of the ease of use, low fees, and high liquidity for issuing new currency on the Solana network. The smart contract Layer 1 blockchain continues neck-and-neck with Ethereum in the race to dominate decentralized finance. From its debut through Dec. 24, Fartcoin’s price posted a percentage gain of 1,847,357%, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Who would have thought that a currency named Fartcoin would earn the highest percentage gains of any cryptocurrency in 2024? Anyone who’s been paying attention to the meme coin sector: These ragtag upstarts are decidedly the shock jocks of the digital finance industry. 2. MANTRA Bags Win For RWA Tokenization Several meme coins have flown up the price charts in 2024, but so also have altcoins with specific use cases and direct utility. That’s shown the market’s demand for currencies that power useful applications and artificial intelligence (AI). Mantra continued hitting new ATHs all year, in June, July, and October, and then surged to a major peak in November, which dwarfed all previous records. From January through December, this crypto gained the second most ROI out of any top 100 coin. Mantra’s (OM) crypto token is the currency that powers its Layer-1 blockchain focused on security and optimized for real-world asset tokenization (RWA). The platform is built from the ground up to comply with and enforce real-world regulatory requirements in accounting for real-world assets. Why Mantra’s Price Ratcheted Up In 2024 Launched in Q4 2020, Mantra has come a long way in the meantime. A big part of Mantra OM’s rise this year is its successful attainment of licensing from financial authorities to remain compliant with regulators as it expands to a global user base. Mantra secured licensing from authorities in the United Arab Emirates in addition to its license to operate and provide regulated financial services in Hong Kong. That will help it to become a key player in building a truly global “Internet of Things.” In June, Mantra’s (OM) tokens achieved an all-time high of $1.09. Moreover, this was a remarkable milestone because the rest of the cryptocurrency market was in a slump at the time. That milestone came as a result of a partnership between Mantra and the UAE’s Zand Bank. The two are collaborating to define clear frameworks for RWA tokenization that comply with the Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority of Dubai. After that, OM hit another all-time record high in October. That came after Mantra’s price surged more than 60% in under 30 days to nearly $1.50 with a total market cap of $1.2 billion. Overall, Mantra (OM)’s price gained 8,776% on crypto markets from Jan. to Dec. this year. 3. Virtuals Protocol Wins Crypto AI Meta Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) is a new Layer-2 decentralized protocol that works across blockchain L1s and the Web 1.0 and 2.0 layers. But its main feature is the tokenized, decentralized creation and management of “AI agents.” These artificially intelligent agents can be deployed from the blockchain to social media apps like Telegram and to online games and metaverses—hence the name Virtuals. As a result of its enormous increases, the token for Virtuals Protocol was the third biggest gainer in 2024. From Jan. 1 to Dec. 24, VIRTUAL grew in price by 6,068%. 4. Ondo, Another Sweep for RWA Tokenization Markets heavily rewarded real-world asset tokenization in 2024. They also liked currency platforms with other specific, unique, and valuable use cases (think Render token and AIOZ Network). The appearance, however, of not one but two different RWA tokens in the six leading cryptos by ROI in 2024 underscores the promise of this segment. Ondo is another RWA token that saw posted big gains. Ondo tokens allow users to participate in its decentralized autonomous organization and have special perks for users of Flux Finance, which is governed by Ondo DAO. Altcoin traders know that winners tend to win again. Ondo hit new all-time high exchange rates in April , March, and May before doing so again in December . That supported its class-leading gains this year. Ondo’s price increased from Jan. 1 to Dec. 24 by 1,758%. 5. Aerodome Chalks Boon For Decentralized Exchanges Utility and memes hauled the most annual ROI in 2024. Utility strikes again with Aerodome, an automated market maker (AMM) for Coinbase’s Ethereum Layer-2 platform, Base. Aerodrome works by serving Base’s central liquidity hub with a clever liquidity incentive engine governed by a decentralized consensus model. Exchange rates for its AERO tokens took flight this year. Listed on crypto exchanges starting in Aug. 2023, Aerodome (AERO) hit soaring ATHs in Mar. and Apr. this year. The AMM altcoin did it again in Dec.. From Jan. 1 to Dec. 24, AERO notched 1,672%. 6.

She filed some grave charges against Akridge for using her blockchain expertise to take millions of dollars worth of staking rewards from her Solana holdings. According to the lawsuit, Akridge allegedly controlled her crypto accounts between March and May, taking all the staking commissions for himself. The couple ended their 10-year marriage in February 2023. Rossi has filed a lawsuit accusing Akridge of breaking agreements, unfairly benefiting from her money, and committing fraud. She is asking for compensation for the financial losses she says he caused her. Co-founded by Stephen Akridge, along with Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal, Solana has played a key role in advancing decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 technologies. Akridge, who previously worked at Qualcomm, was a principal engineer at Solana and is now the CEO of Cyber Grant, a cybersecurity company. A Complex Crypto Case The case highlights the challenges of managing crypto assets in personal disputes. Staking rewards are a popular way for crypto holders to earn passive income, with Solana offering annual yields of 5.6% to 12%. Liquid staking platforms like Jito make this even more attractive by allowing users to earn extra rewards through decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Community Reactions and Next Steps So far, neither Akridge nor Solana Labs has commented on the allegations. The lawsuit has drawn attention from the crypto community, involving personal and financial disputes tied to the rapidly growing blockchain space. As Solana continues to grow in the DeFi world, this case reminds us of the importance of clear asset management, especially in high-stakes environments like crypto. The outcome of this legal battle could set a precedent for how similar cases are handled. With Solana ETFs on the way, such negative news can impact future adoptions raising questions on crypto integrity.",News|Crypto Scam,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|SOL,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-28 05:16:44

Blockchain tracker Whale Alert detected the transfer of nearly three trillion SHIB tokens, an event linked to BTCTurk, Turkey’s second-largest centralized cryptocurrency exchange. The movement of such a significant amount of SHIB has sparked discussion and speculation about its purpose. Massive SHIB Transaction Uncovered The transaction involved the transfer of 2,884,590,622,344 SHIB tokens, valued at approximately $65.7 million. Whale Alert identified the funds as being moved from BTCTurk to an anonymous wallet. On-chain data reveals that the transfer occurred within the past 17 hours. This movement of one of the most recognized meme coins has captured the attention of crypto enthusiasts, with some suggesting it could involve a large holder, or “whale,” moving their assets. BTCTurk, however, clarified that the transfer was part of routine operations. A statement says, “these transfers are fully managed by us, and there is nothing out of the ordinary.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Additional Transactions and Speculation The SHIB transfer was not the only large movement tracked by Whale Alert. The platform also reported three significant Ethereum (ETH) transactions from BTCTurk. These transfers included 23,285 ETH, 20,000 ETH, and another 20,000 ETH, collectively valued at $220 million. BTCTurk explained that these transactions were part of their “wallet optimization efforts.” Despite this clarification, some crypto community members speculated about the nature of these movements, with concerns raised about the possibility of a security breach. The exchange responded to these speculations directly under Whale Alert’s posts, reiterating that the transfers were internal and standard operational procedures. SHIB Metaverse Launches on Shibarium Meanwhile, the Shiba Inu team has made progress on a long-awaited project. The SHIB Metaverse is now accessible for early users through the Shibarium blockchain. This development marks a significant milestone for the SHIB ecosystem after years of preparation by the team, including the pseudonymous leader, Shytoshi Kusama. Users can now connect their wallets to the Metaverse, claim virtual land plots, and explore various features. This virtual environment allows users to construct homes, explore temples, interact with nature, and participate in community-building activities. The launch represents a significant step in expanding the utility of SHIB beyond its meme coin origins. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Dogecoin remains the leading crypto in the meme coin ecosystem. A recent change in fortune has seen the Dogecoin price drop by over 20%, but the Dogecoin bulls are fighting back. Meanwhile, DOGE investors are looking at Lunex Network , a new decentralized finance (DeFi) token, as a viable crypto investment to diversify their portfolios. Currently in presale, Lunex has raised over $5.5 million and there’s more to come. Let’s find out why investors are bullish on the relatively unknown crypto project before launch. A DOGE alternative is a great idea for investors While the numbers look good for DOGE presently, the meme coin faces a challenge – it’s a coin backed by social media hype from influential personalities like Elon Musk. That means a slowdown in its hype could result in less demand for the meme token, especially since competitors like PEPE and WIF have higher gains. That’s why utility-backed assets like Lunex are great options for Dogecoin investors. The Lunex Network is already showing how much utility has on price growth with its presale , which has raised over $5.5 million. What are these use cases? First, the Lunex ecosystem has a cross-chain DEX that supports trading across multiple blockchain networks. With over 50,000 crypto pairs, the DEX prevents liquidity issues for DeFi traders and investors. There’s also a self-custodial wallet to store any of the supported cryptocurrencies. With support for over 40 blockchains and thousands of assets, it’s easy to store and manage funds on a single device. Moreover, Lunex token holders can stake their coins for up to 18% APY. These exciting features make Lunex a great crypto investment for investors. Interestingly, the ongoing presale provides a limited-time opportunity for interested investors to stack up LNEX tokens at a discounted rate of $0.0048. Dogecoin maintains pole position in the meme coin market Dogecoin has been in the news after its year-on-year growth of over 250%. However, the recent price drop in the broader crypto market saw its market cap threatened. After falling into the red zone in the past week, the DOGE price and market cap are now back up. For context, the Dogecoin price is down by about 13% in recent days. However, DOGE bulls have been fighting back, evident through its rebounding price. Similarly, the DOGE market cap has increased by over 3% within the same period per data from CoinMarketCap, reinforcing the coin’s position as the top meme cryptocurrency by market capitalization. However, there’s still a long way to go for DOGE to turn around the losses from the past weeks into gains. Can DOGE reach $1 in 2025? There have been different DOGE price predictions ahead of the new year. Many believe that DOGE will move from its current price of less than $1 to be the next meme coin to reach $1. The optimistic DOGE price prediction makes it a potentially rewarding crypto investment for investors and traders looking for short-term gains. The potential increase will be influenced by factors like Elon Musk and his social media hype, Donald Trump’s new administration, and increased demand for DOGE among traders.

CIFR's strategic growth includes significant capacity increases in Texas, with new facilities like Black Pearl and Stingray, enhancing mining efficiency and computational power. Despite cash burn concerns, CIFR's low production costs and high gross margins position it well to capitalize on the ongoing cryptocurrency bull market. I upgrade CIFR to a ""Buy"" due to its growth potential in Bitcoin, AI, and HPC markets, though investors should expect high volatility. Cipher Mining Inc. ( CIFR ) is currently working towards strengthening its positioning among Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining and high-performance computing [HPC] infrastructure. To this end, CIFR focuses on obtaining low-cost energy and operational efficiencies as it builds its data center capacity. CIFR’s growing mining fleet is also adapting to the challenges of the 2024 Bitcoin halving and potentially volatile market conditions. So far, CIFR’s operations have increased with the acquisition and development of new facilities. Its target is to reach 23.5 EH/s by the end of 2025. Similarly, the company believes its business is also a good fit for the emerging AI and HPC market trends. For instance, Meta ( META ) and Nvidia ( NVDA ) use CIFR’s infrastructure. So I lean bullish on CIFR’s as it has a low-cost production model backed by secular tailwinds with high Bitcoin prices. More than a Miner: Business Overview Cipher Mining Inc. is a technology and infrastructure company that develops and operates data centers designed for Bitcoin mining. It also uses excedent energy monetization by providing infrastructure for Artificial Intelligence [AI] and High-Performance Computing [HPC] tasks. Source: Corporate Presentation. October 31, 2024. Since my previous analysis , CIFR has made surprising progress as it scaled its operations ahead of the 2024 Bitcoin [BTC] halving. This is why CIFR is now able to reap the rewards from those strategic decisions, as Bitcoin mining rewards are now cut by half, which typically heralds a secular bull market in cryptocurrencies. Texas Play: Strategic Growth Moreover, CIFR successfully increased its capacity by 300 MW with its 70-acre Black Pearl facility in Texas. This will essentially increase the efficiency and hash rate it uses to provide its mining and computing services. CIFR’s goal is to reach a production of 23.5 exahash per second [EH/s] by the end of 2025, which would basically make CIFR a leader in its industry. Thus, CIFR’s Black Pearl site’s production will contribute to this goal by enabling more mining rigs and boosting the computational power rate. The data center at the Black Pearl site is under construction and scheduled to be operational in Q2 2025. Source: Corporate Presentation. October 31, 2024. Additionally, on November 26, 2024, CIFR announced the acquisition of another 250-acre site in Stingray, West Texas. As you may have noticed, Texas is a sector with low-cost energy resources, which is ideal for CIFR’s business model. The company disclosed it paid $4.1 million upfront and signed the agreement to a variable fee of $1.5 per megawatt-hour [MWh] for five years after the site started operations. The variable cost is linked to the amount of energy CIFR’s installation consumes from the grid. After all, this site is directly connected to the main power grid with an agreement with ONCOR that will be fully supplied by 1H2026. Mining Efficiency and Future Expansion Furthermore, on December 03, 2024, the company recently disclosed that 202 Bitcoins were mined in November. This included 30 Bitcoins mined at joint venture data centers and 13 Bitcoins from excess electricity monetized at $96,542 per Bitcoin. In other words, in that single month, it generated roughly $19.5 million in revenues, which implies an impressive annual revenue run rate of $234.0 million. However, CIFR actually sold 234 Bitcoin to manage its liquidity and still held another 1,383 Bitcoin in its treasury. In fact, it has 258 Bitcoin as collateral to ensure its financial operations. Additionally, CIFR has 76,000 mining rigs deployed, with 12.0 EH/s, which is close to their year-end 2024 target of 13.5 EH/s for bitcoin mining. Likewise, its fleet’s efficiency (energy consumption per terahash) was 20.8 joules per terahash [J/TH], slightly less than the projected value of 18.9 J/TH. So, while CIFR seems to have come in slightly below its internal projections, it’s still benefiting immensely from the ongoing bull market in Bitcoin. Source: Corporate Presentation. October 31, 2024. It’s also worth mentioning that CIFR’s Odessa site has upgrades that should be ready by year-end 2024. If they materialize, it could place its operations among the industry’s most efficient mining fleets. This matters because, together with the Black Pearl site, the new Stingray facility, and a total of 11 sites, CIFR would reach a total power pipeline of 2.6 GW by 2027. Bitcoin and HPC Markets Currently, the Bitcoin mining industry reported record-low hash prices in Q3 2024, which translated into reduced revenues. However, CIFR mitigated these headwinds with its low-cost units, which are as low as $0.027/kWH. This means that in 2024, the company achieved an all-in cost of production for one Bitcoin of approximately $18,162. This production cost implies an extraordinarily favorable ROIC, as Bitcoin trades multiple times higher than that. Note that these costs already include energy, grid fees, and other energy-linked expenses. Moreover, CIFR’s Odessa has the lowest electricity cost per Bitcoin, approximately $17,561. This facility is the company’s primary production hub and contributes around 83% of its Bitcoin mining operations. The rest of its mining comes from joint venture facilities with higher costs than Odessa, with a mean cost per Bitcoin of $22,928. Source: Corporate Presentation. October 31, 2024. CIFR is currently among the leading Bitcoin miners in terms of Bitcoin production costs. For comparison, miners such as the giant Marathon Digital Holdings ( MARA ) had an average electricity cost of $22,000 to $24,000 per BTC. Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) had a power-related cost average of around $26,000 . However, RIO has higher than CIFR’s mining costs, averaging approximately $20,000 per BTC. Hut 8 Mining ( HUT ) is closer to CIFR because it also aims to be a diversified company that offers HPC workloads. But again, HUT’s costs are around $31,482 per Bitcoin mined as of Q3 2024. Moreover, in hash rate terms, CIFR’s target of 35 EH/s with fleet efficiency of 15 J/TH by year-end 2025 would only strengthen its cost advantage due to low energy costs and operational efficiency. Source: Corporate Presentation. October 31, 2024. According to its latest earnings call , the company plans on expanding its capacity to 927 MW in 2025. For this, it’ll increase by 866 MW with new facilities, like the Black Pearl, as it becomes operational. The increase in capacity from 327 MW in 2024 to 927 MW in 2025 is part of the company’s strategy to grow and produce Bitcoins as efficiently as possible. Furthermore, CIFR is leveraging its large sites, fast energization, and the use of its data centers by major companies like McKinsey, Meta, and Nvidia. In fact, the company believes it can become a key player in the HPC and AI markets. This is why CIFR is actually well-positioned to capitalize on the current power scarcity and support computing loads for these types of corporate tasks. In a way, CIFR’s mining operations give it a unique set of competitive advantages to fulfill those requirements. Diversification with AI and HPC is key because it’ll transform CIFR from a pure-miner play closer to a general computing firm. Mining is highly profitable during a bull market, but AI and HPC are much more stable with recurring revenue streams, which lowers CIFR’s exposure to Bitcoin’s cyclicality. You see, most of CIFR’s data centers, like the Odessa site, have Application-Specific Integrated Circuit [ASIC] mining rigs designed for cryptocurrency mining. However, the newer projects like the Black Pearl and Stingray facilities are developed to support dual purposes including Bitcoin mining and colocation agreements for AI and HPC tenants. Source: CME. These tenants use GPUs and other specialized equipment requiring specific cooling systems, high bandwidth, and redundant power supplies. The company plans to integrate its AI and HPC capacities into its broader 2.6 GW total power potential by 2027, which indicates an emphasis on the new focus of its portfolio. But it also shows its business will be much more flexible going forward. For instance, industry data suggests AI inference workloads can generate $7 in revenue for every $1 spent on GPU over four years. This is likely significantly higher than Bitcoin mining’s ROI during a bear market. So, dedicating a fraction of its capacity to HPC tasks lets CIFR tap into that growing global AI market . Computing demand from that sector is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 37% from 2024 to 2030. It’s also worth highlighting that on December 16, 2024, Bitcoin hit a record-high price of $106,449. For instance, the US elections were a positive catalyst for the price of Bitcoin because President Trump has repeatedly signaled a favorable stance towards this industry. Also, the Fed is on a rate-cutting cycle , which should act as an additional tailwind for asset prices as well. The CME rate probability tool suggests there’s an 82.7% aggregate probability of lower rates by December 2025. In my opinion this will give a macro environment for CIFR’s business. Relatively Cheap: Valuation Analysis From a valuation perspective, CIFR trades at a $1.9 billion market cap. This means the company is no longer a microcap, but I also believe there’s still more room to grow as long as the cryptocurrency secular bull market continues. As of Q3 2024, CIFR’s balance sheet held $25.3 million in cash and short-term investments against no financial debt other than typical operating liabilities. I also see its balance sheet also has $95.5 million worth of Bitcoin. Its equity book value reached $672.0 million, suggesting a P/B of 2.3. This actually appears reasonable compared to its sector’s median P/B of 3.5. Source: Seeking Alpha. According to Seeking Alpha’s dashboard on CIFR, CIFR is projected to generate $301.1 million in revenues by 2025. Naturally, we need to take these projects with a grain of salt because they rely substantially on the price of Bitcoin. As long as the current cryptocurrency bull market continues, it should be a realistic projection, but I believe its long-term revenue growth will be highly volatile because the underlying commodity is highly erratic as well. Investment Caveats and Risk Analysis Nonetheless, $301.1 million in future revenues implies a forward P/S of 6.3. This is actually slightly higher than its sector’s median forward P/S of 3.3. Still, I believe the main metric to track is CIFR’s gross margins, which should capture its Bitcoin production cost relative to the price it realizes when monetizing it. Currently, CIFR’s gross margins stand at 62.3%, which is significantly higher than its sector’s gross margins of 51.0%. However, we can’t ignore that if CIFR’s infrastructure expansion somehow leads to higher production costs, it could hit substantially its margins. Similarly, if the price of Bitcoin declines substantially, it could lead to equally large shareholder losses. Investors need to fully understand that, for now, CIFR remains largely a derivative on the price of Bitcoin itself. In the long run, CIFR’s operations might diversify more into other areas like AI and HPC computing, but for now, it’s still largely a miner and nothing more. As with other mining companies, as long as the underlying commodity rallies, the stock will likely follow as well. But the inverse is also true, so new investors need to understand this is a highly cyclical security by nature. Source: CIFR’s latest 10-Q. Another potential red flag is that CIFR’s cash burn remains persistent despite its secular tailwinds. I estimate CIFR’s trailing nine-month cash burn reached $224.5 million by adding its CFOs and Net CAPEX. This figure includes its intangible asset purchases and Bitcoin sales. Clearly, CIFR has made substantial CAPEX investments expecting to monetize them into 2025, but if the price of Bitcoin declines, it could also lead to massive losses for investors. Source: TradingView. Nevertheless, on balance, I believe it’s fair to lean bullish on CIFR, as it’s focused on growing its operations to capitalize on a multitude of highly promising secular trends (Bitcoin, AI, HPC computing). Hence, I feel it’s fair to upgrade CIFR to a “Buy” for investors who understand this will be a volatile security. “Buy” Upgrade: Conclusion Overall, I believe CIFR has outpaced my initial expectations, which is why I feel it deserves a rating upgrade. In particular, I like its pivot towards potentially diversifying its business in the long run with AI and HPC computing. Also, as long as the ongoing cryptocurrency bull market persists, the company seems well-positioned to continue creating shareholder value. I do have some cash burn concerns, but if Bitcoin rallies more into 2025, then I anticipate CIFR will generate substantial revenues that will allow it to recoup its 2024 CAPEX. Thus, I rate CIFR a “Buy” for investors who understand this is a highly cyclical and volatile stock closely linked to the price of Bitcoin itself.",BTC-USD|CIFR|CIFRW,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-12-28 05:31:21

Prince Elon (ELONPRIN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONPRIN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Prince Elon can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Prince Elon could become the next viral memecoin. Prince Elon launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Prince Elon on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Prince Elon by entering its contract address – 7rAsmWGTtPFY9RFnhd9biard7PrWtw5ZigowwfmaXUQ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONPRIN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-28 05:32:00

The pullback may be scary to some, but that’s just what happens in the crypto market. As these coins go through hard times, savvy investors are turning to Lunex Network and its trailblazing presale. This project is turning heads and has an explosive potential that would see it rise to unprecedented levels. That is why many have dubbed it the fastest growing crypto token today. Lunex Network Presale Keeps Soaring Higher Lunex Network is a brand new presale that is shaking things up pretty well right now. Even though it debuted just a couple of months ago, it has raised over $5.5 million from investors. In addition to that, 2.5 trillion tokens have been sold in the presale, since everyone wants a piece of it. The major reason investors are going in on Lunex is its potential for accelerated growth. The protocol champions crypto swaps across multiple blockchain networks, which is a groundbreaking feature in the DEX arena. To top that, Lunex favors community growth and development. This is evident in its staking rewards and revenue sharing strategies. Lunex tokens are purchased from the open market and a portion of this is shared amongst LNEX holders as staking rewards. In this manner, LNEX rewards loyal holders and simultaneously fosters a strong community. These features combine to paint a stellar future for the project. The Lunex presale is available for $0.0048 but it is billed to appreciate by 800% before the presale ends. This is why several experts have called it the fastest growing crypto of the moment. Will Chainlink Price Weather The Crypto Storm? Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that is very important for the efficient execution of smart contracts. But this has not spared Chainlink price from the latest market correction. LINK has shed just about 15% from its peak in early December and now consolidates around $242. Despite the current slump, analysts still have a positive outlook for Chainlink. Technical indicators continue to show bullish LINK predictions. Given Chainlink’s importance to smart contracts, there’s a good chance of a LINK resurgence. Toncoin Slides Dangerously After November Boom TON is the native token of the Telegram Open Network (TON), and its November rally has drawn genuine interest from investors. But since the last market correction, Toncoin has shed significant portions of its value, and TON holders are starting to get concerned. To put things into perspective, TON fell by as much as 15% over the last couple of weeks and it has been on a downward trend since the market correction. Despite the temporary setback, experts maintain conservative optimism about TON’s future. But it’s better to take this optimism with a pinch of salt. Join the fastest growing crypto train Owing to their struggles after the last market correction, investors aren’t too keen on TON and Chainlink. This dip didn’t affect Lunex Network since it’s a crypto presale, and that is why it is a highly recommended investment option. Lunex Network is starting a revolutionary movement, and it’s only a matter of time before it goes viral. Joining the Lunex train before it hits the limelight could fetch investors profits in excess of 10,000%. No one should miss out on it.

Regulatory changes and a crypto-friendly SEC leadership could enhance Bitcoin ETF efficiency, making IBIT more appealing and reducing costs for investors. Short-term volatility persists, but demand-supply dynamics and miners' HODLing behavior support a bullish outlook for Bitcoin and IBIT by 2025. IBIT offers a convenient way for investors to gain crypto exposure without direct ownership hassles, benefiting from BlackRock's management and liquidity. After a 15% dive from its mid-December peak of $60.7, the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) trades around $53.5. It has heftily outperformed the S&P 500 this year, showing crypto's resiliency in a highly volatile year, as highlighted by the orange chart below. seekingalpha.com After the election of a crypto-friendly President and powerful rhetoric like elevating Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) to become a national reserve asset, its value crossed the psychological $100K level about two weeks back. However, Jerome Powell's subsequently making unfavorable comments about the Fed's ability to hold digital assets, and sounding hawkish on monetary policy did send prices lower. In such a context, while volatility risks should persist in the short term, this thesis aims to paint a bullish outlook for 2025 based mainly on demand-supply economics. Also, after recent comments by one of the SEC’s commissioners, there is likely to be a policy shift towards crypto which may enhance BTC's appeal and improve the tracking efficiency of ETFs investing in the digital asset. Changes in Crypto Regulations Could Benefit IBIT First, looking at the leadership change at the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission), the current Chair Gary Gensler is preparing to vacate his position. While he can be credited with approving several Bitcoin ETFs in January this year, this came only after he faced legal pressure. For this matter, a U.S. appeal court ruled in favor of Grayscale's application to convert its Bitcoin Trust into a spot ETF in August 2023, a move that was initially opposed by U.S. regulators. Therefore with Gensler's departure, there are expectations of a more supportive regulatory environment for crypto investments. This is especially so because Paul Atkins who has been nominated by President-Elect Trump as his replacement has experience in financial services including crypto and regulatory compliance since he served as one of the SEC's commissioners from 2002 to 2008. Also, he currently leads Patomak Global Partners, a financial compliance consultancy company, and is co-chair of the Token Alliance , an industry-led initiative of the Chamber of Digital Commerce. Since the alliance focuses on connecting crypto exchanges with blockchain projects, it shows Atkins' commitment to fostering innovation in the blockchain-based payment world. Tellingly, this is an area where the U.S. is behind other developed countries, and, in addition to providing more balanced regulatory oversight (in contrast to his predecessor), Mr. Atkins possesses the qualifications necessary for making sweeping changes. Thus, from strict regulation , regulators may be more open to deep crypto-related regulatory changes, a possibility supported by Commissioner Hester Peirce who indicated that under new leadership, the SEC may revise key decisions on crypto ETFs and in-kind redemptions . Well, these would allow ETF investors to redeem (sell) their shares for the underlying digital asset, for example, Bitcoin instead of going through cash. In other words, in-kind redemptions could enable the exchange of ETF shares for crypto, which could then be transferred to a wallet. This is also synonymous with more efficient transactions and eliminates costs (trading and taxation) associated with cash transactions for those wishing to convert their Bitcoins to ETF shares As a result, this can improve tracking efficiency or the degree to which an ETF's market price is aligned with its NAV. In this way, IBIT can track Bitcoin price movements more closely potentially reducing the 20% performance gap as shown below. seekingalpha.com Looking further, direct exchanges of ETF shares for crypto could potentially enhance liquidity in the ecosystem, in turn leading to lower costs for fund managers namely by avoiding the buy/sell spreads normally associated with converting Bitcoins to cash. Consequently, if these cost savings are passed on to investors, in-kind redemptions could lead to lower expense ratios, but this ultimately depends on the funds' structure and objectives. Volatility Risks are likely to Persist in the short term but Therefore, innovation, whereby Bitcoin is used for purposes other than storing value, can lead to more demand while in-kind redemption can increase efficiency gains in turn increasing the appeal of spot ETFs like IBIT. However, this cannot happen overnight or just by changing one rule. The reason is in-kind redemption introduces other challenges like having sufficient Bitcoin liquidity (compared to cash before), especially during volatile market conditions. The reason is a liquid market reduces the bid-ask spread and increases the efficiency of the trading experience each time there is a transaction, or a buy at the offer or sell at the bid. Also, for the mechanism to function well, the custody risks associated with transferring large volumes have to be addressed to avoid incidents like the Ronin Network hack (2022) involving $600 million worth of coins being lost. In the same vein, using blockchain and cryptocurrencies to allow people to transact directly should also incorporate risk mitigation strategies because of scams and hacks and millions of dollars of losses suffered. Therefore, it may take some time before crypto-friendly measures are implemented and in the meantime, due to high expectations, there may be further volatility, a possibility supported by the price situated below the 10-day moving average and the RSI of 55 being overbought territory at the time of writing (chart below). The momentum (www.seekingalpha.com) However, looking beyond the short term, as far as Bitcoin trades above the $80K break-even level, miners who are essential components of the ecosystem as the producers of digital assets should continue to stay profitable. Demand-supply economics is Favorable to Digital Asset Prices This suggests they can obtain relatively more cash per Bitcoin they sell on the open market to finance their operations, in turn allowing them to HODL or hold more coins in their treasuries, thereby reducing supply. Ultimately, this supports digital asset prices. On the other hand, Jerome Powell has said that the Fed cannot hold Bitcoins, which somewhat goes against Trump’s intent of creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve. This may have reduced crypto allure in the minds of some investors and possibly contributed to BTC falling off its mid-December peak of $106K. Another contributory factor that also negatively impacted the broader market is interest rates likely to stay higher longer in 2025 as the fight against inflation lingers on. This makes the cost of capital dearer for miners planning to refinance or invest in new and more efficient equipment. Thus, in case asset prices fall further, miners may be constrained to sell more Bitcoins, resulting in more supply and pressurizing prices. However, this is currently not the case with a top crypto analyst stating that the BTC market is increasingly dominated by the HODLing sentiment since miners believe its value will go higher. Now, in the rapidly shifting dynamics of the crypto market, miners HODLing their Bitcoins is key as it means less supply is likely to reach the markets, implying that as long as demand is sustained, asset prices could rise. To come up with an estimate, I consider that currently, Bitcoin hovers around the $96K level which is near my prediction of $95.4K calculated some six weeks earlier in my previous thesis on the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA: BITO ). At that time, I used a multiplier of 9.18%, a figure obtained after accounting for past inflows, liquidity conditions, and price elasticity. Again, using the same multiplier and incrementing BTC's current value of 96K by 9.18%, I obtain a target of $104.8K or roughly $105K. Making the case for an investment in IBIT, Amid Volatility Now, by holding Bitcoin directly, IBIT tracks the digital asset's price movements closely. Thus, its shares should also gain, but, this time, I multiply its current share price of $53.5 by 7.34% (or 80% of 9.18%) to take into account IBIT's approximately 20% of deviation from Bitcoin's price. Hence, I obtained a target of $57.4, which represents only a modest upside of around 7% but is justified because of the risks. www.ishares.com One of these could be momentum-related or failure to sustainably break through the key resistance level of $100K, thereby causing selling pressure. Second, Bitcoin remains rate-sensitive not only because higher borrowing costs impact the finances of miners as mentioned earlier but also because higher interests could shift investor mindset to becoming more risk-averse. Thus, they could dump riskier digital assets like Bitcoin alongside growth stocks like tech and flock to value stocks. Third, with the investment products around BTC growing in sophistication, hackers may be tempted to target more vulnerable components of the ecosystem including crypto wallets, and exchanges. Talking of exchanges, any occurrence of an FTX-style scandal can be highly detrimental to the trust factor. Fourth, any news update about Bitcoin used for illicit activities as earlier emphasized by Gensler may undermine regulatory efforts to bring changes, especially innovation. Still, we are at a uniquely favorable juncture for Bitcoin with a Republican- controlled Congress , increasing crypto ownership among Americans, ETF-led adoption, and strong network effects, implying the cryptocurrency can rise further. Add to this drastically lower Bitcoin issuance, or the number of units awarded to miners which has dropped to around 412 daily from 943 before the April halving, implying more scarcity. Equally important, a more favorable regulatory environment could increase the efficiency of ETF transactions and reduce costs. For this purpose, IBIT is already trusted by many who want crypto exposure but without enduring the hassles of direct ownership, such as subscribing to an exchange and owning a wallet. Finally, another advantage is it is managed by giant asset manager BlackRock ( BLK ) and comes with better liquidity and trading volumes given its sizable assets under management. This is more than 2.5 times higher than its two closest peers Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ) and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ) as shown below, making it easier for large investors to enter or exit positions. www.seekingalpha",IBIT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-12-28 05:47:25

Starting in 2027, DeFi platforms will have to collect user trading information, issue tax forms, and provide customer details like names and addresses. This rule is meant to make digital asset taxes similar to traditional ones. However, some experts worry that this could be tough for decentralized platforms since they don’t have centralized entities to collect this data. This change is part of the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, but it’s facing opposition from crypto groups. Why Experts are Against the Rule? Crypto industry leaders are pushing back against the IRS’s new rule that treats decentralized exchanges (DeFi platforms) like traditional brokers. Uniswap’s Chief Legal Officer, Katherine Minarik, and CEO, Hayden Adams, both argue that the rule should be challenged, with Adams hoping it will be rejected through the Congressional Review Act. Yep, @CampbellJAustin beat me to it.

Recent Reserves And Netflows Indicate Market Reversal,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/is-the-tide-turning-for-bitcoin-recent-reserves-and-netflows-indicate-market-reversal/,"Analysts from the market intelligence company CryptoQuant note that current patterns in Bitcoin (BTC) metrics indicate possible changes in market dynamics. Bitcoin Price Faces Short-Term Volatility After a period of steady decline, spot exchange reserves have experienced a notable uptick, reflecting an inflow of 20,000 BTC. This increase suggests that more Bitcoin is being deposited into exchanges, which often indicates an intention to trade or sell. This type of behavior may add further selling pressure to the Bitcoin price, which has declined almost 7% over the last two weeks, signaling a potential early sign of short-term volatility. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Struggles to Hold Ground: Another Drop Incoming? Simultaneously, netflows across all exchanges have turned positive, with a net increase of 15,800 BTC. This reversal from the predominantly negative trend seen in recent weeks implies that inflows to exchanges are now exceeding outflows. When combined with rising reserves, this shift strengthens the likelihood of increased trading activity or profit-taking by investors, according to CryptoQuant’s analysis. While the broader trend in the market has favored accumulation and self-custody, these recent changes may reflect a growing caution among investors, who might be preparing for profit-taking or bracing for a potential price correction. Furthermore, a report by Bloomberg highlights a key metric gauging investor interest in Bitcoin from South Korea, which has risen to a four-month high amid ongoing political turmoil in the East Asian country. Trading Volumes Surge As Political Crisis Unfolds Known as the “Kimchi Premium,” this metric measures the price gap between Bitcoin on South Korean exchange Upbit and Coinbase. Recently, this premium surged to the range of 3-5%, indicating heightened demand from South Korean investors. Per the report, the political landscape in South Korea has been tumultuous, particularly following President Yoon Suk Yeol’s brief and controversial declaration of martial law earlier this month, which lasted only six hours before being rescinded. Subsequently, the National Assembly impeached Yoon on December 14, suspending his powers and elevating Prime Minister Han Duck-soo to the role of acting president. In a further development, the parliament voted to impeach Han as well, marking a historic first for an acting president in South Korea. These political upheavals have rattled financial markets, coinciding with growing economic challenges and increasing nuclear threats from North Korea. The South Korean won has also seen a decline of 0.35% against the US dollar. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Setting For a Big Move – Breakout Or Downturn? According to Bloomberg, South Korea remains one of the most active retail markets for cryptocurrencies, with trading volumes on Korea-based exchanges often surpassing those on traditional stock exchanges. Ki Young Ju, founder and CEO of CryptoQuant, pointed out that corporate accounts are not permitted on Korean crypto exchanges, meaning that the vast majority of crypto activity in the country is driven by retail investors. The Kimchi Premium has become a well-known metric for measuring retail interest in cryptocurrency, and factors such as strict currency controls and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations have contributed to this phenomenon. At the time of writing, BTC is priced at $93,938, experiencing a 2.5% decrease over the last 24 hours, with its closest support level at $92,000 serving to halt additional declines for the top cryptocurrency in the market.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-will-dominate-2025-analyst-claims-heres-why/,"A recent tweet by prominent cryptocurrency analyst BarriC has generated significant discussion within the XRP community . The analyst predicts substantial growth for XRP in 2025, suggesting that the current period offers a valuable accumulation opportunity. This article will analyze BarriC’s claims, considering supporting factors and recent market activity. XRP To Dominate 2025 BarriC’s tweet asserts that XRP will “dominate 2025.” This prediction is coupled with a specific timeframe for accumulation, suggesting that the current price range of $2-$2.30 in 2024 represents a “cheap” entry point. The analyst pinpoints the second week of January 2025 as the beginning of a significant “alt season,” implying widespread growth across alternative cryptocurrencies, with XRP leading the charge. $XRP will dominate 2025 That gives everyone a few days left to accumulate #XRP at the cheap price of $2-$2.30 in 2024 Once we get to the second week of January 2025 we will experience the beginning of the biggest alt season anyone has ever seen That’s when we see the next god… — BarriC (@B_arri_C) December 25, 2024 This period is expected to culminate in what the analyst describes as a “god candle” for XRP, signifying a large and rapid price increase, ultimately pushing the asset into double-digit valuations. Anticipated Regulatory and Political Shifts Two major factors have been cited to support this optimistic outlook. The inauguration of a new U.S. administration and the anticipated departure of Gary Gensler from his position as Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The change in political leadership in the United States and a change of leadership at the SEC could potentially usher in a more favorable regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies, including XRP. The context of the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple Labs is crucial here. The outcome of this legal battle has had a direct impact on XRP’s price and market performance. If the change in administration and at the SEC results in clearer regulations or a shift in the regulatory approach towards cryptocurrencies, it could be viewed positively by the market and potentially contribute to a price increase for XRP. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Impact of Whale Accumulation In addition to these factors, recent market activity strengthens the case for a potential price surge. Crypto investor Armando Pantoja recently highlighted substantial whale accumulation of XRP. According to Pantoja, 50 million XRP was acquired by whales in a single weekend. Pantoja’s commentary on this activity, stating that “They move in silence before the storm,” suggests that these large investors are strategically positioning themselves for an anticipated upward price movement. Whale accumulation is often interpreted as a bullish signal, as it demonstrates significant investment and confidence from major market participants. Large-volume purchases can impact the market and can be a sign of increased confidence and market participation. While regulatory developments and whale activity can provide valuable insight, they do not guarantee specific outcomes.

Yet, as the market matures, some prominent DOGE enthusiasts focus on projects with more tangible use cases. One such enthusiast is a prominent Dogecoin millionaire who is now betting big on a new real estate altcoin, PCHAIN , that promises to revolutionize the property investment landscape. This altcoin aims to democratize access to the $600 trillion global real estate market using blockchain technology to tokenize real estate assets. With the Dogecoin price struggling in recent months, top market analysts strongly believe this real estate altcoin could emerge as the next big winner, outpacing DOGE’s gains by Q2 2025. The Dogecoin millionaire’s move has sparked widespread interest in the crypto community, as this real estate altcoin presents a compelling alternative to meme-based investments. The altcoin seeks to bridge the gap between digital assets and tangible wealth creation by focusing on real-world applications. The Dogecoin Millionaire and the Quest for the Next Big Break in the Crypto Market This prominent DOGE millionaire turned a modest $10,000 investment in DOGE into over $2 million during its rally to $0.73 in May 2021. Riding on the enthusiasm of the “Doge Army” and tweets from Tesla CEO Elon Musk, this DOGE millionaire epitomized the kind of success story that draws many to the crypto market. However, since its peak, DOGE has faced challenges. Its price has fluctuated significantly, losing much of its momentum. For the Dogecoin millionaire, DOGE’s declining momentum marked the beginning of a new search for the next big thing break in the crypto market. The DOGE millionaire has identified a real estate altcoin, PCHAIN, with the potential to outpace Dogecoin come Q2 2025. PCHAIN is the utility token of PropiChain, a blockchain-powered real estate platform using cutting-edge technologies to revolutionize the real estate industry. Unlike Dogecoin, whose value is driven primarily by hype and social media momentum, this real estate altcoin is backed by real-world assets and an innovative ecosystem poised to disrupt the $600 trillion global real estate market. With the clock ticking toward 2025, this DOGE millionaire believes this real estate altcoin will live up to its potential and leave Dogecoin in its shadow. The Dogecoin Millionaire’s Reason for Betting Big on the Real Estate Altcoin While explaining the rationale behind his huge investment in the real estate altcoin, PCHAIN, the DOGE millionaire, said, “Dogecoin was a phenomenal ride, but it’s primarily driven by hype and sentiment. I’m now looking for projects with real-world utility and long-term growth potential. PropiChain (PCHAIN) ticks all the boxes.” The millionaire has reportedly allocated about 50% of his portfolio to PCHAIN, which he believes positions him for significant returns by Q2 2025. “Real estate is a multi-trillion-dollar market, and tokenization is the future. I’m confident that PropiChain will outpace DOGE in terms of market cap and adoption by Q2 2025,” he added. According to analysts, PropiChain’s growth potential is significant, given the global real estate market’s size. By tapping into this massive industry, this real estate altcoin has the opportunity to establish itself as a cornerstone of blockchain-based real estate transactions, further reinforcing the DOGE millionaire’s belief in the crypto token. PropiChain Powering the Future of Global Real Estate PropiChain is revolutionizing the global real estate sector with state-of-the-art technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), the Metaverse, blockchain-based tokenization of Real World Assets (RWA), and smart contracts. The platform offers investors round-the-clock personalized support through AI-powered virtual assistants and chatbots, providing step-by-step guidance throughout the investment journey. These innovative tools ensure a seamless and tailored experience designed to meet each investor’s unique needs. PropiChain’s advanced predictive AI capabilities analyze market trends and dynamics to deliver highly precise forecasts. These insights empower investors with actionable data, enabling them to identify and seize emerging opportunities in an ever-changing market. This technological advantage helps users navigate the complexities of the real estate industry with greater confidence. Furthermore, PropiChain integrates the Metaverse to utilize virtual reality and 3D visualization for immersive property exploration. The Metaverse feature allows investors to virtually tour properties anywhere in the world, eliminating the necessity of on-site visits and making global property exploration more accessible. PCHAIN’s blockchain-powered tokenization of real-world assets represents a transformative shift in the real estate industry. By converting physical property assets into digital tokens, the platform facilitates fractional ownership, enabling individuals with small capital to purchase fractions of high-value properties. This inclusive strategy opens doors to premium real estate markets for a broader audience and attracts a more diverse pool of investors. In addition, PropiChain enhances operational efficiency through the use of smart contracts, which automate key processes such as property leasing and lease renewals. These automated solutions reduce reliance on intermediaries, cutting costs and saving time while increasing the transparency and efficiency of real estate transactions. PCHAIN’s innovative approach sets new standards for accessibility, efficiency, and innovation in the real estate sector. Conclusion The Dogecoin millionaire’s bet on PCHAIN for its potential to outpace DOGE in 2025 underscores the prospect and profit potential of PropiChain. The first round of the PCHAIN presale grossed over $1.3 million, while the second round raised over $500,000, a sign of investor confidence in the project’s potential. After this second presale round, the token price will increase from $0.011 to $0.023 for the final presale round. Join the PCHAIN presale now for the massive profit potential and to enjoy early access to the future of the $600 trillion global real estate market. Analysts project your $1000 early investment would yield over $315,000 by Q2 2025. The token is listed on CoinMarketCap , indicating the project is ready to take the crypto market by storm. BlockAudit , a top blockchain security firm, audited the project’s smart contract and found no vulnerability.

Bitcoin's 133% YTD performance and potential for further gains make it a compelling investment, despite its historical volatility and downside risks. The incoming Trump administration's potential National Bitcoin Reserve and favorable regulatory backdrop could serve as significant bullish catalysts in 2025. IBIT offers a convenient way to gain bitcoin exposure with lower transaction costs, and its growing AUM and trading volume reflect strong investor interest. Wall Street’s crystal balls are out in full force. With just a few trading days left in 2024, S&P 500 price forecasts are generally bullish (for the first time in three years) while prognostications for bitcoin are likewise sanguine. According to data gathered by Bitwise, the average 2025 price target for bitcoin is above $170,000. Of course, this is not as pure of a sellside look compared to SPX targets since not all of the big banks produce bitcoin forecasts and there are some small companies with vested interests in bitcoin growth also putting out forecasts. Still, it’s clear that bullishness around bitcoin remains in full force after a 133% year-to-date performance, making bitcoin the top sub-asset class of the year. I produced Seeking Alpha’s first analysis of the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) back in January. It has grown to become the largest spot bitcoin ETF. I was neutral on IBIT back then, but turned bullish in the second quarter – that's when I bought the fund. While others have a much lower bitcoin cost basis, I see upside looking ahead to 2025 after the recent pullback from $108,000. 2025 Bitcoin Price Targets André Dragosch, PhD | Bitcoin & Macro YTD Asset Returns: Bitcoin Leads Goldman Sachs According to the issuer, IBIT seeks to reflect generally the performance of the price of bitcoin. The ETF enables investors to get exposure to bitcoin through the convenience of an exchange-traded product, helping remove the operational, tax, and custody complexities of holding bitcoin directly. IBIT has been the most traded bitcoin exchange-traded product since its launch, providing investors with potentially lower transaction costs. IBIT has grown massively from its January inception. Total assets under management is now $53 billion, with increased volume since the start of the fourth quarter. Its annual expense ratio is low at 0.12%, though BlackRock notes that after the 12-month waiver period that began on January 11, 2024, the Sponsor’s Fee will be 0.25%. Share-price momentum has been very strong this year, though there have been bouts of volatility and drawdowns that shareholders of the ETF needed to stomach. I expect more volatility next year. Of course, IBIT does not pay a dividend , but I recently pointed out that there is a liquid covered-call bitcoin ETF: the YieldMax Bitcoin Option Income Strategy ETF (YBIT) which I had a nearer-term hold rating on back when bitcoin was above $100,000 per token. IBIT is a risky ETF given its historical standard deviation trends, but liquidity is strong . Average daily volume is north of 25 million shares, while its 30-day median bid/ask spread is tight at just two basis points, per iShares. Turning to my opinions on bitcoin and why I’m optimistic about the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency, take a look at the below graph. After gold’s 2024 rally, bitcoin is just 11% of gold’s market cap. I assert that there’s a runway for bitcoin to approach gold in total value. If that were the case, then bitcoin could eventually approach the $1 million mark. That would take years, in my view, but we have seen that bitcoin rallies can be intense. Bitcoin Still A Small Asset Compared to Gold In Gold We Trust Report It’s important to be realistic about returns and volatility, though. While bull runs in bitcoin have resulted in thousands of percentage points of gains, drawdowns have typically been on the order of 70% or more. So, prospective investors must be aware of the significant downside risk that’s possible. Recognize the Risk: Bitcoin Drawdowns Have Been Intense Koyfin Charts A potential bullish catalyst in 2025 is the so-called National Bitcoin Reserve that could be put in place by President-elect Trump. As it stands, there’s an implied 58% chance that it will be created before January 1, 2026. That’s a key variable – if it’s effectively constructed, then there would likely be added demand for bitcoin. High Hopes for a Bitcoin Reserve Kalshi With a favorable regulatory backdrop given the incoming administration and a new SEC chairperson set to take over in January, let’s also analyze historical seasonal trends. January has typically been a solid month for the token. The average gain since 2011 has been 12% with a median first-month return of 5%. Fifty-seven percent of Januarys have been up. For Q1 as a whole, it’s the only quarter with positive mean returns for each of the three months. So, seasonality is generally bullish right now. Bitcoin: Bullish Q1 Seasonal Trends Barchart The Technical Take With optimism on the sellside, a still-modest value compared to gold, some bullish political catalysts in the new year, and sanguine seasonals, the technical situation is decent. Notice in the chart below that bitcoin has pulled back from its all-time high above $108,000. The rally to triple digits came on weaker RSI momentum, which was a bearish harbinger. For now, I see support in the low $90,000s and just above $85,000. If it drops below those levels, then a retest of the March 2024 highs near $74,000 could be in play. But take a look at the long-term 200-day moving average – its slope is positive, which shows that the bulls control the primary trend, Bitcoin turned extended versus the 200dma earlier this month, so I see the current pullback as healthy. Moreover, the RSI momentum gauge has not turned oversold, which is another sign that the bears have not gained a whole lot of traction. On the upside, if we take the $55,000 range from late 2021 through earlier this year, and add that on top of the $74,000 breakout point, then we arrive at a ballpark target of near $129,000. Bitcoin: Bullish Long-Term Breakout Targets $120-$130k Stockcharts.com The Bottom Line I have a buy rating on IBIT. I own the fund, and I see further upside in 2025. I encourage fellow investors and prospective investors to recognize that IBIT and bitcoin will likely be highly volatile in the next 12 months as macro news, namely concerning developments with the Trump administration, could be up and down. But with some upside catalysts next year and positive seasonals and technicals, the bullish factors outweigh the bearish risks.",BTC-USD|IBIT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-12-28 06:03:00
38214731,https://coinpedia.org/?p=399138,1735365851,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,Bitcoin Weekly Trade Analysis: Is BTC Price Set for a 20% Drop Ahead of Yearly Close?,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-weekly-trade-analysis-is-btc-price-set-for-a-20-drop-ahead-of-yearly-close/,"The post Bitcoin Weekly Trade Analysis: Is BTC Price Set for a 20% Drop Ahead of Yearly Close? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Bitcoin bulls have switched to the passive mode as they cannot exert enough pressure even in times of a drop in selling volume. This indicates a lack of interest among the market participants, as bears also remain inactive. In such a scenario, an extended pullback usually attracts buying volume and as a result, the last week of the year may attract another 10% to 12% loss, pushing the token under the bearish influence. Bitcoin Faces Bearish Pressure: Key Support Levels to Watch for Year-End The BTC trading volume has surged to some extent compared to the past couple of days, which suggests the volatility could pick up during the weekend. The star token continued to break the supports after failing to secure levels above the resistance, weakening the bulls to some extent. In such a case, the possibility of recovery could be only if the token manages to trade above the pivotal support of around $92,000, which may lay the foundation for the trade in 2025. The BTC price displays some possibility of a bullish rebound as it heads towards the lower support of the falling wedge. The two levels to watch at the moment are $95,767 and $93,211, which are the 50-day SMA & EMA, respectively, acting as interim resistance and support. Breaking any of these levels may have a huge impact on the yearly close, as a rise above the resistance could initiate an early breakout above the falling wedge. Besides, a drop below the support could drag the levels close to the support at $92,109 and collide with the descending trend line as well. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Prediction For December 28 , The RSI is decremental, which indicates the trend could remain under bearish influence, activating the lower targets. Therefore, if the Bitcoin price fails to initiate a recovery to $100K during the weekend, a bearish signal could be confirmed with the support lying between $71,000 and $81,000 while long-term support being around $65,000. Hence, these targets could be activated only if the token closes the weekly trade below the pivotal range of around $92,200, delaying a new ATH for several weeks. BTC Price Action Therefore, considering the current price action, it appears that the range between $80,000 and $85,000 could be a good buyback range, which could offer a good long-term opportunity for the Bitcoin (BTC) price rally. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The filing includes products with 1x, 2x leveraged, and -1x inverse exposure to Solana futures. Thus, it will allow traders to benefit from both – upward and downward SOL price movements. Volatility Shares Futures Solana ETF Come With Leverage Options Volatility Shares filed a futures Solana ETF with the SEC offering leveraged options allowing traders to bet on swing movements for SOL price in either direction. Basically, this futures ETF will allow investors exposure to Solana’s performance through futures contracts. The fund focuses on futures contracts traded exclusively on Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) registered exchanges. The ETF will mirror 100% of SOL returns by primarily investing in near-term and next-term Solana futures contracts. Moreover, to support this investment, the fund maintains collateral in the form of cash, cash equivalents, and high-quality securities. Thus, the futures ETF will provide investors with a structured approach and a regulated way to gain exposure to SOL price movements. It will also maintain appropriate collateral to back its future position. This is not the first time Volatility Shares is planning to launch a future crypto ETF. Previously, the firm played a significant role in pushing forward the Ether futures ETFs. Clearing Path for Spot SOL ETF? Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst, has weighed in on the recent filing for Solana (SOL) futures-based ETFs by Volatility Shares, calling it a “wild” move. Balchunas pointed out the unusual timing, as Solana futures are not yet live, and noted the inclusion of a leveraged 2x product as particularly bold. “This is hardcore,” Balchunas remarked. Balchunas further stated that the ETF filing marks the imminent launch of Solana futures and that this development could improve the odds of spot Solana ETF approval in the future. However, earlier this month, Balchunas had predicted that Litecoin and HBAR ETFs would get approval even before Solana ETFs hit the market. As of press time, the Solana price is trading down 2.87% at $184. Since mid-November, SOL has been moving sideways with other players like BNB Coin and XRP overtaking it in the crypto ranks. Market analysts predict a Solana price surge to $1,000 in the case if the US SEC gives a green light for spot ETF.

It seems every week brings a new sensation, with clever branding, fun communities, and impressive use cases catching everyone’s eye. Despite a turbulent crypto market, these meme coins have held their ground, proving that there’s more to them than just laughs. This week, the spotlight is on BTFD Coin (BTFD), Fantom, Cronos CRO, and Stellar. Let’s dive into what makes these coins worth your attention and why they’re the top new meme coins to join this week. 1. BTFD Coin (BTFD) BTFD Coin is rapidly making a name for itself in the crowded meme coin market. Currently in its 13th presale stage, BTFD Coin has impressively raised over $4.6 million and gained the support of more than 6,900 holders—affectionately known as Bulls. The current price stands at $0.000142, showcasing a remarkable return on investment (ROI) of 3,450%since its initial price of $0.000004. The presale continues to gain momentum, having surpassed $1 million in under 10 days and $2.5 million in just 14 days since its launch, with over 60 billion $BTFD coins sold to date. As this meme coin gains traction, there’s an exciting opportunity for investors, especially with the special offer to use the BIG50 code to unlock extra coins. BTFD Coin stands out by blending fun with real utility, making it a potentially rewarding investment in the cryptocurrency landscape. Don’t miss out on becoming part of this vibrant community! The charm of BTFD Coin isn’t just in the numbers, though. It’s got a fully-fledged Play 2 Earn (P2E) game, which launched in beta during Stage 10. While the beta doesn’t offer rewards just yet, the gameplay is already turning heads. Add to that a generous staking programme with a 90% annual percentage yield (APY) and a referral programme that gives users a chance to earn even more, and you’ve got a recipe for success. Another highlight? The Bulls Squad. This is an exclusive community of BTFD enthusiasts who get early access to updates, premium perks, and behind-the-scenes news. It’s all about building a tight-knit group of believers who see the massive potential in this coin. Why did this coin make it to this list? Simple.

Fantom Next up is Fantom, a name that’s already well-known in the crypto world but continues to innovate and expand its appeal. Fantom stands out because of its incredibly fast and scalable blockchain platform, which is perfect for decentralised finance (DeFi) applications. While it’s not strictly a meme coin, its growing community and creative branding give it that meme-worthy vibe, making it a worthy contender in this list of top new meme coins to join this week. Fantom’s edge lies in its Lachesis consensus mechanism, which ensures near-instant transactions and low fees. It’s the kind of tech that makes you wonder, “Why isn’t everyone using this?” The project’s focus on sustainability is also a big plus, particularly in today’s environmentally-conscious world. And if you’re into DeFi, you’ll love how Fantom integrates with various protocols to offer staking, lending, and yield farming opportunities. Another reason Fantom’s got everyone’s attention? Its partnerships. Fantom has been making waves with collaborations that boost its ecosystem’s utility and user base. It’s the kind of coin that’s constantly innovating, which is exactly what you want in your portfolio. Why did this coin make it to this list? Fantom’s tech is ahead of the curve, its branding is engaging, and its potential for growth is undeniable. While it’s not a traditional meme coin, its rising popularity and fun-loving community earn it a spot here. Jump in before it skyrockets further. 3. Cronos (CRO) Cronos CRO is the native token of the Cronos blockchain, which powers the Crypto.com ecosystem. With its sleek branding and growing adoption, it’s no wonder Cronos has made waves recently. And while it may not scream “meme coin” at first glance, its community’s enthusiasm and dedication give it that playful edge we’re celebrating this week. Cronos’ charm lies in its focus on interoperability and decentralised applications (dApps). The blockchain’s compatibility with Ethereum and Cosmos networks allows it to support a wide range of assets and dApps. That means more opportunities for developers and users alike. And let’s not forget the massive backing from Crypto.com, which gives Cronos a level of credibility and reach that most meme coins can only dream of. But there’s more. Cronos has been making strides in the NFT space, attracting creators and collectors with its user-friendly tools and low fees. It’s also gaining traction in DeFi, with staking and yield farming options that appeal to both beginners and seasoned investors. Why did this coin make it to this list? Cronos CRO combines serious utility with a community-driven approach that makes it feel like a meme coin—but with real substance. It’s a versatile asset with the potential to thrive in various sectors of the crypto market. Don’t miss your chance to be part of its journey. 4. Stellar Stellar has been quietly making waves in the crypto scene for years, but its recent developments have given it a fresh buzz. Known for its focus on financial inclusion, Stellar’s blockchain aims to make cross-border payments faster, cheaper, and more accessible. It’s a noble mission that’s resonated with a growing number of users and investors. What makes Stellar stand out is its partnership with major financial institutions and its integration with traditional banking systems.

Wanting to be part of the next big move in the crypto market , Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders are now gravitating towards a new player in the PayFi sector— Remittix (RTX) . Financial experts believe Remittix will outperform XLM’s recent meteoric rise as it gains more ground in the $190 trillion payment market. With RTX set to be the next 50x altcoin , it looks to thoroughly outperform SHIB which could increase by more than 240%. Stellar (XLM) Prepares for New Pump After Cooling Off In November, Stellar (XLM) was one of the best altcoins , skyrocketing by more than 600%. CoinMarketCap’s data shows that the Stellar coin increased from $0.09200 to trade as high as $0.5700. However, XLM has cooled off, dropping back to the $0.380 range. Despite the recent Stellar price action pointing towards bear action, Javon Marks, a top analyst and strategist has said that everything has led to a possible continuation. Marks also confirmed that Stellar (XLM) has formed yet another bullish pattern. According to his analysis, the Stellar crypto will rise to $ $0.681 first. If XLM can hold above this level, it will open up the altcoin price for a bigger increase in the coming weeks. The final target set by Marks for Stellar (XLM) is at $1.2, representing an increase of more than 220% from its current range. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Confirms Bullish Continuation Set for 240% As a result of the recent market correction, $SHIB tumbled from $0.00003400 to retest the support level at $0.00001800. However, the memecoin has bounced off this strong support to reclaim $0.00002300, per CoinMarketCap . This recent Shiba Inu price action has been confirmed to be the beginning of a bullish continuation by Javon Marks. TheMoonCarl has confirmed this, saying that the Shiba Inu coin is ranging within an ascending triangle on the 1W chart. According to his analysis, the conservative target for Shiba Inu (SHIB) in this bull cycle is around $0.000056. Marks is even more bullish, saying that the Shiba Inu token could well trade as high as $0.000081 in this cycle, a 240% increase from its current range. Why SHIB Investors Are Migrating To Remittix (RTX) While the memecoin could record substantial gains in 2025, it doesn’t compare to Remittix (RTX) , the next 50x altcoin, according to financial experts. The forecasts for RTX, a coin priced at $0.0163, are bullish because of its revolutionary cross-border payment solution. International money transfers are known for being slow, expensive, inefficient, and for most people in the world, unavailable. This issue is taken care of by Remittix which lets anyone send 30+ fiat currencies to any bank account from their cryptocurrency wallets. Remittix allows users to receive 50+ top crypto coins and convert them without any FX fees. It is also faster, cheaper, more reliable, and available to anyone from anywhere on earth. It does this by using Unified Compliance frameworks, advancing the right partnership with global corporations, and tokenizing fiat currencies. Remittix is not just for retail crypto users. Its use case naturally catches the eye of institutional investors who can quickly spur crypto adoption, and Remittix starts climbing up the crypto ladder. The DeFi project has already raised over $650K in its first presale week, highlighting how much interest there is from investors. Can Remittix Outperform Top Altcoins; Stellar and Shiba Inu? Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders pivoting towards this promising new PayFi project Remittix (RTX) underscores the allure of the new altcoin . Set in a $190 trillion market, RTX looks to score bigger gains than Stellar, with a potential rise of 50x in this bull cycle.

As a new project, it brings massive promise for the 2025 bull run. That’s because DTX Exchange brings great perks and features for traders. They can use this new crypto trading platform to make higher profits while trading and improve themselves. The best part is that the DTX token also promises life-changing gains for investors. Namely, it’s set to surge by 100x by Q1 of 2025, fueled by the bull run and massive demand! DTX Exchange: The Future of Trading Starts Here DTX Exchange is a cutting-edge new trading platform. As such, it brings great features for traders, allowing them to finally have a better trading experience. One such feature is its easy-to-use platform. Namely, the DTX Exchange interface is suitable for both new and seasoned traders. It allows them to trade many different assets from one dashboard. This will help them a lot, as they won’t have to switch between multiple platforms to trade. Furthermore, DTX Exchange makes asset management much easier. It does this through its Phoenix Wallet. The Phoenix Wallet is a great new wallet that supports 10,000+ assets. So, it lets you manage all your investments in one safe place. This will reduce the time it takes for you to keep all your investments in check. So you’ll get more time to focus on your trading and strategy. DTX Exchange will also help you boost your profits. That’s because it offers a massive 1,000x leverage to traders. Such an offer can’t be found anywhere else right now, which is yet another feature that will attract many traders as the bull run heats up. With this kind of leverage, you can turn even a small trade into huge profits, making life-changing money with just a few trades. Also, you won’t have to make multiple trades every day to hit your goals anymore! In addition, DTX Exchange offers one of the best features you can have during a bull run—speed! Namely, by using the VulcanX blockchain, DTX Exchange offers a massive 100,000 TPS. This is an unparalleled speed by all accounts, trumping Solana’s 600 TPS significantly! A Fair Investment Opportunity for Everyone: Only With DTX Exchange DTX Exchange also brings some features that are extremely rare in today’s market. One of them is an incredibly fair launch system. Usually, new projects are supported by large investors like whales and VCs. In these cases, the large investors get in before everyone else. This gives them the power to manipulate the token price. Also, they will make much larger profits than others because they’ve entered much earlier. So, they can nuke the chart and take their profits out of the blue, leaving everyone else with nothing. This is why many see new projects as very risky. However, DTX Exchange is here to change all of that. Firstly, it isn’t backed by any large investors. Instead, currently, over 300,000 individual wallets are supporting DTX. And this number is growing with every new day. Also, DTX is currently in its public presale, giving everyone an equal opportunity to get in. So, there are no whales or VCs that can ruin DTX’s price. This is extremely rare for a new project, which is one of the many reasons why so many investors are scrambling to get in! Furthermore, DTX Exchange has an incremental cliff price system. This makes sure that the DTX price increases steadily as it starts and continues trading on exchanges. So, no investors will be left with their accounts drained, and everyone can profit massively off of DTX Exchange! Start the Bull Run With a Bang: Join the DTX Public Presale Now! The bull run is set to be extremely kind to DTX. Namely, experts see this promising token as the leader of the bull run, which is why they’re so confident in it. Also, DTX Exchange’s popularity will be fueled by the great perks it offers to traders. All of these combined can take DTX’s price to massive highs very soon! Right now, DTX is in Stage 7 of its public presale, as Stage 6 got sold out in record time. At this stage, you can purchase your DTX tokens at $0.14, but you’ll have to hurry. Stage 7 will end very soon, and Stage 8 will take its place with DTX selling for $0.14. DTX’s price will continue to rise during the presale, launching at $0.20 in the end. Once this happens, experts say DTX’s price rally will begin . They foresee DTX’s price rising by 100x in just a few months after the launch, bringing life-changing gains to holders as it does!

His commentary highlights significant price levels that could dictate the asset’s future movement, framing them as pivotal for understanding potential bullish or bearish trends. #XRP – Noise Until One of These Happens Key Levels to Watch: 1⃣ $2.00 – A confirmed break here, and we’ll be heading toward the lower targets. 2⃣ $2.65 – Break this level, and fireworks will ignite! The upper targets will be in play! #XRPFamily STAY STEADY AND… pic.twitter.com/sDPUwY3fyK — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 26, 2024 Key Insights from Egrag Crypto’s Analysis Egrag Crypto identified two critical levels to monitor in XRP’s price action: $2.00 Level: According to Egrag Crypto, a confirmed breakdown of the $2.00 price point could signal bearish momentum, potentially driving XRP toward lower price zones. This threshold is seen as a crucial support level, and failure to maintain it could indicate increased selling pressure. $2.65 Level: On the flip side, a successful breakout above $2.65 is described as a bullish trigger that could pave the way for higher price targets. Egrag Crypto suggests this movement could ignite substantial upward momentum, implying the possibility of XRP reaching or exceeding the $2.91, $3.55, or $3.77 levels marked on the chart. XRP Price Analysis The accompanying chart visually depicts XRP’s price consolidating within a triangular formation, bounded by support at $2.00 and resistance near $2.65. This pattern often represents a period of indecision, where price compresses before a significant breakout or breakdown. The yellow box around the triangle highlights the broader consolidation range, while annotated price levels provide further clarity on possible scenarios. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP Community Reacts The analysis sparked discussions among the XRP community. An X user, Razor, offered a contrasting perspective, asserting that traditional chart patterns may be irrelevant in the current market environment. Razor commented: “Charts mean shit now, crypto has moved into a different space. Price will be determined on utility and the value it brings to the system. I see a lot more stability in the market for utility coins going forward.” This viewpoint highlights an evolving trend in the cryptocurrency space, where utility and fundamental value are increasingly seen as key drivers of long-term price stability, as opposed to speculative trading or purely technical indicators. Final Thoughts Egrag Crypto’s analysis provides a structured framework for understanding XRP’s potential price movement in the near term. It equips traders and investors with actionable insights by identifying critical levels and offering possible scenarios. However, as Razor’s comment suggests, the crypto market is maturing, with utility and adoption playing a larger role in determining long-term value. For now, XRP enthusiasts are advised to monitor the $2.00 and $2.65 levels, as the asset’s price action near these thresholds could provide crucial signals for its next major move.

The major happenings for the current week were the creativity of hackers in hacking and the weak spots still existing in the ecosystem. Below, is a close-up view of the hacker attacks this week. Fraudsters in Pig Butchering Scams Defraud Victims of $3.6 Billion. In 2024, Pig Butchering scams took over $3.6 billion and are one of the most dangerous threats to crypto users. These elaborate schemes establish a foundation of trust, finally leading to the victims being manipulated into investing in fake crypto investment platforms. In total, there were 800,000 fake transactions made to over 150,000 Ethereum wallets. Phishing Ads con NFT users of Pudgy Penguins With a new phishing technique, fraudsters launched Google ads to trick Pudgy Penguins NFT project members into handing over their wallet information to fake sites. The campaign targeted ad networks and weak Web3 front-ends. That is why ad blockers, URL checks, and separation of wallets’ actions in safe zones are advised, according to the experts. Animoca Brands Chairman’s X Account Hacked Hackers managed to breach Yat Siu’s X account to pump up a fictitious “ANIMOCA” token before running off after the fraud was unmasked. Mishap which was worked around the 2FA security shows vulnerability within social media platforms and the need to confirm such announcements before putting resources on any investment offers. Crypto Miner Suffers $1MILLION Theft From Zoom Malware A DeFi miner lost $1 million after a phishing attack that seemed like a fake Zoom app. In addition to directly stealing funds, the malware obtained credentials of wallets and private keys to boost the threat of malware-based schemes. $500,000 Lost Through Fraudulent X Account Phishing Scams Phishing emails which copied official letters were used to con 15 high-profile X accounts, in which attackers stole more than $500,000 . Such scams made people provide their login information and 2FA codes. Security specialists advise to not re-use passwords, use hardware wallets, 2-factor authentication and confirm emails before acting on them. Lazarus Group Allegations Strike at Hyperliquid In the Layer-1 DeFi platform Hyperliquid, $250 million has been net outflow, after which it was accused of being hacked by North Korea’s Lazarus Group . Despite the platform’s denial of this, its token lost 20% of its value leading to discussions about the danger of centralization of validators and poor measures for security. The events of the week show that hackers are becoming more professional and equipped as the cryptocurrency market remains weak. From phishing attacks, and social engineering tactics to malware attacks, it is extremely important to keep an eye out and avoid leaving various assets open-ended. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Winter Pepe (PEPEWINT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEWINT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Winter Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Winter Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Winter Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Winter Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Winter Pepe by entering its contract address – CUreLFB9SJmu6WEpotjmLJgt1khhdpneukDRJsbXFCGM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEWINT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-28 06:55:00

XRP Army Responds",https://timestabloid.com/now-that-rlusd-is-live-what-is-stopping-xrp-getting-to-100-xrp-army-responds/,"A tweet by prominent crypto enthusiast XRP Avengers has sparked a spirited discussion within the cryptocurrency community. The post , which says, “Now that $RLUSD is now live, what’s stopping #XRP price getting to $100?” has generated diverse perspectives from supporters, skeptics, and market analysts. This discourse sheds light on the factors influencing XRP’s price and the challenges it faces in achieving the ambitious target of $100 per token. RLUSD’s Role in the XRP Ecosystem RLUSD, a stablecoin issued on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), has recently gone live, signifying another milestone in XRPL’s ongoing evolution. Stablecoins like RLUSD are designed to provide liquidity, reduce volatility, and promote seamless cross-border transactions. Their integration into the XRP ecosystem strengthens its utility and appeal to financial institutions, retail users, and developers. While this is a significant development, it alone may not be sufficient to drive XRP’s price to the speculative $100 level. XRP Army’s Perspectives on the $100 Price Target George Vedelek, a commenter in the thread, attributed XRP’s potential price surge to future regulatory clarity. He speculated that a political shift, such as former President Donald Trump returning to office, could lead to executive orders fostering a favorable environment for cryptocurrency growth. While political and regulatory developments often impact market sentiment, the direct correlation between a single political event and XRP reaching $100 remains speculative. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Another user, Andor Byrd, provided a more technical viewpoint, emphasizing the importance of network volume. He pointed out that XRP’s intended use case—facilitating high-volume transactions on a global scale—is essential for significant price appreciation. Byrd acknowledged the possibility of a rapid increase in transaction volume but expressed skepticism about the timeline, stating, “Sure, but when?” Similarly, TFC Guy outlined key factors needed to achieve a $100 price point: massive adoption, regulatory clarity, market optimism, and favorable supply-demand dynamics. He noted that while RLUSD adds utility to the XRPL ecosystem , broader adoption and systemic growth are critical for XRP’s long-term price trajectory. The community’s reactions to XRP Avengers’ tweet illustrate the diverse opinions surrounding XRP’s potential. While some view regulatory clarity as a catalyst, others emphasize the importance of network activity and real-world use cases. While RLUSD’s launch is a notable development, the $100 price target for XRP remains speculative and dependent on multiple variables.

Who can forget the explosion of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? Recently, however, things have been dicey. Popcat, one of the hottest meme coins on the Solana blockchain, saw its price nosedive over 50% in a month. Similarly, Snek, inspired by the classic Nokia snake game, has had its moments of glory but remains a niche player. Amid this chaos, a new star has emerged— BTFD Coin . Its presale has shattered records, pulling in over $4.6 million in just weeks and reigniting excitement in the crypto world. Let’s dive in and see why these three coins are some of the best crypto to invest in 2024. Meme coins have captivated the world for years. What started as jokes turned into full-blown financial movements. Investors and Gen Z traders alike can’t resist the charm of coins like Popcat, which bank on cultural quirks and nostalgia. But meme coins are no longer just about the memes. They integrate games, staking rewards, and community power to create lasting value. Enter BTFD Coin—a game-changer poised to set the meme coin market on fire with its play-to-earn (P2E) game , referral program, and staking rewards. This isn’t just another meme coin; it’s a powerhouse backed by a strong community and tangible benefits. Ready to explore the best crypto to invest in? Here’s a deep dive into BTFD Coin, Popcat, and Snek. BTFD Coin: Turning Dips Into Dollars BTFD Coin’s story is the kind of underdog success that crypto enthusiasts dream about. Starting at just $0.000004 per coin, the token has skyrocketed to a current Stage 13 price of $0.000142. That’s an 837.5% ROI for early investors ! With over $4.6 million raised and more than 60 billion coins sold, BTFD has proven it’s not here to play—it’s here to win. Let’s talk strategy. Imagine investing $20,000 at the Stage 7 price of $0.000064. By the end of the presale, when the coin lists at $0.0006, your $20,000 could balloon to over $187,500. That’s life-changing money, and it’s why analysts can’t stop buzzing about BTFD Coin’s potential. So, what makes BTFD Coin a standout? First, there’s its killer P2E game, where players can earn while having fun. Then there’s the referral program—bring in friends, and you’re rewarded in BTFD. And let’s not forget the staking rewards, which encourage long-term holding and boost the coin’s stability. Ready to grab your share? Head to the presale page at btfd.io . Connect your wallet, enter the bonus code BIG50 for extra coins, and secure your spot before the presale ends. Popcat: The Meme That Went Too Far? Popcat is the quintessential meme coin. Born on the Solana blockchain, it gained massive popularity with its quirky “pop-to-click” feature. At its peak, it crossed the $2 mark. But by December 2024, it had plummeted to $0.7. So, is Popcat still one of the best crypto to invest in? The answer—maybe. Popcat’s main selling point is its charm. Its interactive website, featuring a cartoon cat that “pops” when clicked, is undeniably fun. But there’s a catch: no pop-to-earn mechanism. Without real utility, the coin’s value hinges on market trends and meme culture. Analysts predict that if Bitcoin rallies in 2025, Popcat could climb back to $3 or $4. Otherwise, it may continue its rollercoaster ride, potentially sinking to $0.5 by 2030. Popcat’s community is its saving grace. Meme coins live and die by their fanbase, and Popcat’s supporters are nothing if not loyal. However, without updates or added functionality, it’s hard to see how it competes with dynamic projects like BTFD Coin. Snek: Nostalgia Meets Blockchain Snek taps into a different kind of nostalgia. Inspired by the classic Nokia snake game, this play-to-earn token combines gaming and crypto in a simple and charming way. At its recent peak price of $0.0094, Snek made waves among gamers and blockchain enthusiasts. But here’s the kicker: Snek’s appeal might also be its Achilles’ heel. Its gaming-centric approach is a hit among niche audiences, but it lacks the broader appeal needed for explosive growth. Unlike BTFD Coin, which offers multiple incentives like staking and referral bonuses, Snek’s success largely depends on its nostalgic gameplay. That said, Snek’s simplicity has its own magic. It’s easy to pick up, fun to play, and taps into a market of casual gamers. If you’re looking for a bit offbeat project but still among the best crypto to invest in, Snek deserves a spot on your radar. How to Join the BTFD Coin Presale Want to get in on the action? Here’s how to buy BTFD Coin and unlock bonus coins using the BIG50 code. Go to the Presale Page . Click “Connect Wallet” and select your wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet). Locate the Bonus Code field, enter BIG50, and click “Apply.” Input the amount of BTFD you want to buy and review the discounted price. Click “Buy Now” and confirm the transaction in your wallet. Easy, right? Don’t wait too long—the presale is in its 13th stage, and prices will only go up. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin is a no-brainer for anyone looking for the best crypto to invest in right now. With its explosive presale performance, innovative P2E game, and robust community, it’s set to redefine what meme coins can achieve. Popcat and Snek have their merits, but they’re no match for the momentum behind BTFD Coin. Don’t miss out. Join the BTFD Coin presale today and turn market dips into massive gains. Visit btfd.io now, use the BIG50 code, and get ready to ride the wave to crypto success!

Introduction of the TREAT Token Building upon the momentum of the metaverse launch, Kusama has introduced the TREAT token, poised to become a central component of the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Although details regarding TREAT’s functionalities are forthcoming, it is anticipated to serve multiple roles, including governance, rewards, and enhancing user engagement within the ecosystem. Kusama has indicated that TREAT will help reward systems and DeFi integrations, facilitating innovative partnerships, and empowering users by granting them a voice in decision-making processes through voting mechanisms.

This partnership focuses on utilizing Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology. It allows computations on encrypted data without decryption, ensuring data privacy and security. TREAT is expected to facilitate efficient data processing within this framework, highlighting Shiba Inu’s commitment to leveraging advanced technologies for societal benefit.

These initiatives enhance user experience, foster community engagement, and expand the ecosystem’s utility beyond its origins.

The analyst explained that the pullback could push BTC’s price to the broadening pattern that completed with a breakout above $73,600. However, Kibar emphasized that the head and shoulders pattern must fully materialize for a significant pullback in BTC price to occur. He stated: Seeing it is not enough. It needs to materialize with a breach below the neckline. There are many cases of failed head and shoulders tops especially in steady uptrends well above the year-long average. Other crypto analysts have also shared similar bearish outlooks for Bitcoin’s price. For instance, technical analyst Ali Martinez identified $92,730 as a crucial price level for the top cryptocurrency. According to Martinez, losing this level could push BTC into “free fall territory,” based on UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD). Related Reading: Bitcoin Sell-Off Likely When This Metric Reaches 4%, Analyst Explains For the uninitiated, URPD is a metric that shows the distribution of Bitcoin’s Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) across various price levels, based on when they were last moved. Essentially, it helps identify price zones where significant BTC accumulation or spending occurred, providing insights into investor behavior and market sentiment. In addition, former Wall Street derivatives trader Tone Vays warned that BTC trading below the $95,000 price level would be “very, very bad” for the flagship digital asset. Similarly, renowned trader Peter Brandt recently highlighted the risk of BTC breaking down from a ‘broadening triangle’ formation, potentially falling to the $70,000 level. While several analysts predict a potential price correction, others remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. Thomas Lee of Fundstrat Capital projected that BTC could surge as high as $250,000 by 2025. However, he acknowledged the possibility of a short-term correction to $60,000 early next year before Bitcoin enters a historic bull run. The Long-Term Bullish Case For BTC While BTC may indeed face a looming price correction according to some analysts, the long-term price projections remain overwhelmingly bullish. Crypto asset manager Sygnum posits that BTC may face ‘demand shocks’ due to strong institutional interest in the asset, driving its price significantly higher.

If this pattern plays out, it could trigger renewed bullish momentum for the digital asset. At press time, BTC trades at $94,149, down 2.5% in the past 24 hours.

While these rules largely target DeFi trading platforms rather than individual taxpayers, they will impact how DeFi platforms operate and the experience of their customers. Under Section 6045 of the US tax code, brokers are required to collect know-your-customer (KYC) information from customers, calculate gains and losses, and report this data to the IRS via forms like 1099-B. Last year, the IRS expanded these rules to include custodial cryptocurrency brokers like centralized exchanges (CeFi). Now, the IRS has clarified how these rules apply to the DeFi ecosystem. Interface Layer: This layer allows users to interact with DeFi platforms, including screens, buttons, forms, and other visual elements on websites, mobile apps, and browser extensions. Application Layer: This layer facilitates the execution of trades, including verification and recording of transactions on the blockchain. Consensus layer: Responsible for recording financial transactions on the distributed ledger, including transactions made by users trading digital assets using DeFi protocols.

These platforms, which have the most direct contact with users, will now face stricter reporting requirements. Starting January 1, 2027, DeFi platforms operating as front-end trading services must: Collecting KYC information from customers during onboarding, similar to centralized exchanges. Tracking client transactions and reporting income to both the IRS and clients via Form 1099-DAs. If you are a customer of a front-end DeFi platform, here is what you should expect: KYC Requirements: Similar to the onboarding process for centralized platforms, you will be required to provide your personal information for identification purposes. Tax Reporting: While platforms will report trading income, you will still need to use crypto tax software to track your cost basis and calculate your gains or losses. *This is not investment advice.

ADA is trying to keep momentum, struggling to attain $21 in this cycle. However, a promising rival token valued at just $0.15 is likely to outshine it, maybe crossing the $21 milestone in the first 100 days of 2025. This article examines the present status of Cardano price and the reasons behind why its competitor, Rexas Finance (RXS), could generate significant returns. Cardano Price Struggles in the Market At $0.8777 today, Cardano price has dropped significantly from its early November spike after Donald Trump’s election triumph. ADA broke beyond the $1 barrier, reaching a high of $1.3187 on December 03, 2024 but during the recent bear market, it has suffered a 33.45% drop. This declining trend raises questions about ADA’s ability to keep its current gains, let alone meet its aggressive price forecasts. Cardano’s stagnation in value highlights its shortcomings, as rivals provide more flexible ecosystems and greater growth possibilities. Considering these elements, experts have doubts on Cardano price reaching $21 this cycle. The larger market is uncertain, and the token finds it challenging to inspire fresh investor interest. Cardano (ADA) price chart Rexas Finance (RXS): The $0.15 Cardano (ADA)’s Rival Cardano faces mounting challenges as Rexas Finance (RXS) emerges as a fierce competitor with remarkable growth potential. Currently priced at just $0.15 during its Stage 10 presale, RXS has already demonstrated impressive momentum, achieving a 5x increase since its initial stage. The RWA token project has successfully raised over $30.27 million in its presale, reflecting strong investor confidence and interest. Rexas Finance is transforming the blockchain by closing the real-world and digital economy gap. Its network lets users tokenize actual assets effortlessly, permitting fractional ownership and opening new frontiers for world asset management. With a complete toolkit, including the Rexas Token Builder and the Rexas Launchpad, RXS lets people and companies tokenize assets and quickly generate money. Rexas Finance is leading the way in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, unlike ADA, which has struggled to be widely applicable outside its natural habitat. Its creative strategy makes it a fierce competitor to reach exponential expansion and overcome significant price benchmarks in the following months. Rexas Finance Tokenomics Rexas Finance (RXS) Crossing $21 by Early 2025 According to market analysts, Rexas Finance (RXS) will earn 13,900% profit, driving its price to over $21 in the first 100 days of 2025. This optimism is fueled by its strong ecosystem, Certik audit certification, and unparalleled tokenizing powers. Investors globally have embraced the platform’s goal of democratizing asset ownership. Rexas Finance eliminates obstacles, including complicated legal systems and geographic limitations, by allowing users to tokenize real-world assets such as real estate, goods, and intellectual property. Its presale success and attraction to both retail and institutional investors have come from this practical value. Moreover, Rexas Finance (RXS) keeps developing confidence within the crypto community by stressing security and openness. Certik audit confirms Rexas Finance’s technical integrity and increases investor confidence. With a clear route map and great community support, RXS has positioned itself as a top candidate for exceptional 2025 growth. Rexas Finance also offers a $1M giveaway prize, further encouraging ecosystem involvement. With more than 579,000 entries recorded, the promotion will award 20 winners $50,000 worth of RXS tokens. This deliberate project has improved user involvement and broadened its community base, enabling ongoing expansion. Utilizing the platform’s creative ecosystem and quick presale success, this early-stage cryptocurrency hopes to draw attention as a deserving substitute for Cardano. Final Thoughts: Cardano Price Struggles as Rexas Finance Rises While Cardano price struggles to maintain momentum amidst market uncertainties, Rexas Finance (RXS) stands out as a rising star with extraordinary growth potential. With its innovative approach to real-world asset tokenization, strong presale performance, and robust ecosystem, RXS has positioned itself as a formidable competitor. As Cardano (ADA) faces challenges in achieving its ambitious price targets, Rexas Finance’s promising trajectory and ambitious roadmap make it a compelling investment opportunity, poised to deliver remarkable returns in the coming months and potentially surpass significant milestones like $21 by early 2025.

Dogecoin: The Meme Cryptocurrency with Growing Influence Dogecoin (DOGE) emerged in 2013 as a playful alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies, featuring a Shiba Inu dog from a popular meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin was designed to be abundant, with no maximum supply and 10,000 new coins mined every minute. Initially considered a joke, it gained significant value in 2021, becoming one of the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. This rise was driven by social media influence and interest from figures like Elon Musk. Dogecoin’s potential lies in its active community and the impact of social media on its popularity. Its appeal in the current market cycle depends on these factors and broader trends in the cryptocurrency space. Conclusion With DOGE and XRP showing less short-term potential, attention shifts to Catzilla, the ultimate meme coin hero bringing financial freedom to all. Offering 700% ROI during its presale from $0.0002 to $0.0016 over 14 stages, Catzilla provides governance, loyalty rewards, and staking options.

Recent technical analysis highlights a breach of the upper Bollinger Band at $0.6374, with the 20-day moving average acting as a median point at $0.21. This situation is reminiscent of 2021 when XLM peaked at $0.797 before suffering a sharp 48.73% decline within a week. Over the past three weeks, XLM has already dropped by over 40%, and at the time of writing, it is trading at $0.3541—down 0.4% in the last 24 hours, as reported by CoinMarketCap. Analysts suggest that XLM could face a further 45% drop if bearish market conditions persist. While historical patterns provide some context, external market forces and overall cryptocurrency sentiment remain key factors in determining the token’s future performance. Japanese Government Hesitant on Bitcoin as a Reserve Asset The Japanese government has recently expressed caution regarding Bitcoin’s adoption as a reserve currency. According to Wu Blockchain, citing CoinPost, Satoshi Hamada, a member of Japan’s House of Councillors, urged the government to follow the United States in incorporating Bitcoin into its reserve strategy. Despite these calls, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba stated that Japan lacks sufficient information on the U.S.’s actions concerning Bitcoin reserves. Additionally, crypto assets are not classified as foreign exchange under Japan’s regulatory framework, and concerns about the security and liquidity of such assets have further complicated their consideration as reserves. The government’s stance underscores a cautious approach toward integrating volatile assets into national financial policies. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Shiba Inu (SHIB) Faces Critical Support Level Test Shiba Inu (SHIB) is grappling with significant market challenges, as bearish sentiment weighs heavily on the asset. On-chain data shows that SHIB is trading near $0.00002164, with its key support at the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) under considerable strain. The 200-day EMA is now closely aligned with the asset’s current price, creating an additional layer of vulnerability. A failure to hold these critical support levels could trigger a steep decline, potentially pushing SHIB down to $0.0000204 or lower. Large transaction volumes involving institutional investors have also declined sharply, suggesting reduced confidence in the asset. If key support is lost, panic selling could further amplify losses. However, there remains some potential for recovery if SHIB rebounds from the 200-day EMA and attracts speculative interest. The coming days are expected to be pivotal for XLM, SHIB, and the broader cryptocurrency market, as external factors and investor sentiment continue to shape their trajectories.

With an additional layer of Bitcoin futures integration, the proposed ETFs would track the performance of the S&P 500, Nasdaq-100, and gold. How Will the ProShares Bitcoin-Hedged ETFs Function? As per the SEC filing, these Bitcoin-hedged ETFs will combine long positions in underlying stocks or gold with a short position on the U.S. dollar and a long position in Bitcoin via futures contracts. With this strategy, ProShares seeks to leverage Bitcoin’s potential as an alternative asset while offering exposure to traditional financial markets. Note that the fund doesn’t make any direct investment into Bitcoin. The SEC filing notes that the short U.S. dollar/long Bitcoin strategy is executed by investing in future contracts for Bitcoin. Thus, it provides a currency hedge for the U.S. dollar exposure tied to the S&P 500 stock position. Reset on a monthly basis, this hedge aims to reduce the effects of fluctuations in the U.S. dollar’s value relative to Bitcoin. This move marks another step in Bitcoin’s growing influence over traditional finance (TradFi). Over the years, institutions have been exploring innovative ways to integrate Bitcoin and digital assets into conventional investment methods. Furthermore, industry leaders like Robert Kiyosaki are turning bullish expecting it to hit $350K by the end of 2025. Demand for BTC Bond ETF on the Rise The latest filing from ProShares reflects the growing market confidence towards the flagship crypto. Notably, following the filing of Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Company ETF , REX has proposed a new exchange-traded fund (ETF) aimed at investing in convertible bonds issued by companies that hold Bitcoin in their corporate treasuries. Dubbed the “Bitcoin Corporate Treasury Convertible Bond ETF,” it seeks to provide investors with exposure to firms like MicroStrategy, Marathon Digital, Metaplanet, and others that leverage Bitcoin as a strategic asset. The fund commits to investing at least 80% of its net assets, including any borrowings, in these specialized convertible bonds, noted the filing. The structure offers investors a unique way to gain exposure to companies involved in the bitcoin space while focusing on their convertible bond offerings rather than direct equity or cryptocurrency investments. Inflows into spot BTC ETFs have skyrocketed after Donald Trump’s election victory last month with hopes of rising Bitcoin adoption in the market. The total inflows since inception have skyrocketed to more than $35.6 billion with BlackRock’s IBIT alone seeing over $37 billion in inflows.

Will that finally change for the asset in 2025? Here’s ChatGPT’s answer. Can XRP Break Above $3.4 in 2025? It’s safe to say that the Trump-induced rally after his decisive win in the 2024 US presidential elections benefited some assets more than others. XRP stood quietly below $0.6 but on the hopes that the SEC lawsuit will finally be resolved during a more favorable administration and better regulations, it skyrocketed within several weeks to almost $3. However, its run was halted there and Ripple’s native cross-border token even slipped below $2 on a couple of occasions. It now stands at around $2.15, which is more than 35% away from its January 7, 2018 all-time high of $3.4. With just a few days left in 2024, it seems highly unlikely that this record will fall by January 1. But, what are XRP’s chances for a new all-time high in 2025? Well, ChatGPT’s answer was quite bullish, actually. In the first part, the AI chatbot indicated that numerous analysts and forecasts envision XRP going to $4.5 in H1 of 2025, driven by “factors such as increased adoption and favorable regulatory develpoments.” Furthermore, the AI tool asserted that the asset could shot up to $7 if the aforementioed factors align with better market conditions and investor sentiment. Nevertheless, it also had a second part to its answer, suggesting that “XRP may underperform in 2025 as investors might shift their focus to newer cryptocurrencies, potentially impacting its growth prospects.” And Perplexity Says…? ChatGPT’s rival also outlined XRP’s spectacular price growth at the end of 2024 and highlighted three probable scenarios for the asset for the next year. The conservative one sees XRP stabilizing between its current level and $3. The more optimistic one foresees a price rally to uncharted territory of $4.44 and $5.25. The more outrageous prediction indicates a run toward $8 by the end of 2025. Such a price tag would put XRP’s market capitalization at roughly $500 billion, which would make it the second-largest by that metric if ETH’s stays the same. Perplexity mentioned essentially the same factors that could propel a price rally for XRP, including better regulatory landscape in the US, bullish market sentiment across the entire crytpo fieled, and growing institutional adoption. The last part could be fastlaned if the upcoming SEC administration approves a Ripple ETF , just like it did with BTC and ETH in 2024.

When it goes live, it will become the second memecoin ETP on a regulated stock exchange, following in the footsteps of the Dogecoin ETP. The coin has seen a jump of 400% this year showcasing immense community support to push it to new heights. Many seem to be taking for granted how incredible it is for a #memecoin to have an ETP. There are millions of memecoins, and there are at least 8 memecoins above $1 billion market cap! Of these, only one currently has an ETP on a regulated stock exchange: $DOGE . $FLOKI is next… https://t.co/mPEoIvHrUM — B (Da Viking) (@100bviking) December 27, 2024 Floki’s bullish move is creating a possibility of a memecoin breakout in 2025 as following the lead many others will jump on the ETP mania to leverage the success. Following the news Floki is expected to rise in price and may attract big institutional support. What is the Proposal? As per the proposal, it will allocate a portion of the 16.3 billion tokens in the community’s buyback wallet to provide liquidity for the ETP, while the remaining tokens will be burned. As a result, the token’s price surged 5%, reaching $0.0001797, with trading volume jumping by 58% in just 24 hours. The community-driven projects are seen as a hot choice for crypto investors as many meme coins are supported by political leaders and celebrities. Interest Market is Heating Up Hence, market analysts are bullish about Floki’s potential. With futures open interest (OI) increasing by 10% and derivative volumes up by 74%, there’s a noticeable surge in market interest. Some analysts predict that Floki could rally by over 50%, possibly reaching $0.00055, and even target $0.00080. This growing attention from both traders and analysts highlights Floki’s bullish outlook, especially as the ETP launch could significantly boost its market visibility and investor interest. What Next? Floki Inu is in a recovery phase where its price is holding steady but at the same time it is getting ready for a potential jump. Right now, it’s stuck below a key price level of $0.0002761. If it manages to break through this level, it could soar, with some analysts predicting it could reach as high as $0.0005467, which would be a huge 200% increase from where it is now. The excitement around Floki comes from its strong community, growing partnerships, and increasing attention in the market. If the token can break out soon, it might offer a big opportunity for investors willing to take on some risk. Though the excitement is high, it is better to analyze the market first before investing in the hyped projects as many analysts warn that such projects can be fatal once the craze on social media fades.

In a new interview with Anna Tutova, the CEO of Coinstelegram, Hayes says Bitcoin could hit seven figures in about a year or so due to a massive expansion of monetary supply from governments. “I believe we can get to $1 million end of the cycle – $1 million… b ecause the amount of money that’s going to be printed is going to be absolutely insane as every government around the world does the same thing, which is print money to make my people feel happy because the global growth is slowing… I think that we’re in a transition period of a global financial system. We’re going to change it. The elites will resist the change, which means they’re going to print a lot of money and more money that’s ever been printed because they don’t want the post-World War II US hegemony to change.” Bitcoin is trading for $94,244 at time of writing, down 1.8% in the last 24 hours. Asked how long the current bull market may last, Hayes says, “ Maybe 2026, 2027 is my estimate, but who knows.” He also says that while some altcoins have plummeted, the overall crypto market cap is up compared to more than a year ago, indicating the upward trend remains intact. “The aggregate value of all of crypto has still increased over the last 12 to 18 months, so I believe we’re still in a bull market.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Although it had its share of struggles, the Pepe coin price performance has equipped crypto investors with heavy returns. One such investor made $11.7M recently, showcasing the token’s high profit potential. Let’s discuss what’s happening. Crypto Investor Made $11.7M With PEPE Token’s Downtrend According to Lookonchain , a popular analytics page on X, a crypto investor made incredibly heavy returns in Pepe Coin. Interestingly, all this happened when the PEPE token was in a dip, shocking every reader. The crypto user has been holding millions of this frog-themed coin and dumped them when the PEPE price began to decline after it hit the ATH of $0.00002825 around three weeks ago. With that, the crypto investor made $11.7M in profits, which could have been higher if he had not missed the ATH. Regardless, Pepe Coin’s price performance has helped investors make heavy returns. Interestingly, he is still busy accumulating more PEPE. In the last week alone, he has spent $24.5M to buy 1.42T PEPE, continuing his profit-making journey with this frog-theme meme coin. Interestingly, this is not the first person who has made heavy returns with PEPE. Another PEPE trader made millions after turning $70 into $7M over the PEPE’s impressive price performance. PEPE Token’s Bullish Returns, Price Surged 4% Today Pepe Coin has become one of the most profitable meme coins ever since the beginning of the year due to its constant surges. With that, he achieved multiple all-time highs within the year, and the most recent was just 19 days ago. However, a downtrend began right after that, pushing the PEPE price 35% away, currently trading at $0.00001829 after a 4% surge in the last 24 hours. Interestingly, this happened with the rising investor interest. Earlier, the PEPE’s trading volume peaked at $2.13 billion, indicating high investor activity and whale buying. Furthermore, the technical indicators show a strong buying zone, which could propel the PEPE price higher and out of this slump. What’s In There For You? Considering meme-themed cryptocurrency performance this year, many crypto investors turned bullish, with high returns. As a result, 2024 has become the year of meme coins, which users can consider buying after running proper technical analysis and market research. In today’s case, Pepe Coin is gaining strength on the charts after hitting ATH just a few weeks ago. Now, it has to see if the PEPE token will continue to benefit investors or if the PEPE price will struggle with a market dip.

Trump Cyborg (TRUMPCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCYB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Cyborg launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Cyborg on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Cyborg by entering its contract address – 9yaNQ89EaQ2nEDczZpuTZfDwfiYCxbwSYC4JeiWLDE57 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCYB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-28 08:20:00

In a report published on December 27, Thorn predicted that while discussions around a Bitcoin reserve policy may progress, the government will focus on managing its existing Bitcoin stockpile rather than acquiring more. Thorn suggested that there might be “movement within departments and agencies to examine an expanded Bitcoin reserve policy.” US Government Holds 183K BTC As of now, the US government holds approximately 183,850 BTC, valued at $17.36 billion, according to blockchain analysis platform Spot on Chain . This Bitcoin is spread across various known wallet addresses. Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis has proposed the Bitcoin Act, which, if enacted, would significantly shift the government’s approach. The act outlines a plan for the US Treasury to purchase 200,000 BTC annually over five years, building a reserve of one million Bitcoin to be held for at least 20 years. Galaxy Digital analyst “JW” also weighed in, suggesting that up to five Nasdaq 100 companies and five nation-states could add Bitcoin to their balance sheets or sovereign wealth funds in the near future. JW argued that increasing global competition might push nations, particularly those unaligned with or adversarial to the US, to adopt Bitcoin mining or accumulation strategies. 21 – The U.S. government will not purchase Bitcoin in 2025, but it will create a stockpile using coins it already holds, and there will be some movement within the departments and agencies to examine an expanded Bitcoin reserve policy. – @intangiblecoins — Galaxy Research (@glxyresearch) December 27, 2024 Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has recently expressed skepticism, noting on December 26 that the Japanese government lacked sufficient understanding of the actions being taken by the US or other nations regarding Bitcoin reserves. Meanwhile, former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao speculated that smaller nations might be the first to adopt Bitcoin reserves. Speaking at the Bitcoin MENA conference in Abu Dhabi on December 9, Zhao also suggested that China could eventually embrace a strategic Bitcoin reserve, although he acknowledged that such changes would likely unfold gradually. US States Consider Adding Bitcoin To Reserves Ohio has become the latest US state to consider adding Bitcoin to its treasury reserves, following the introduction of a new bill by House Republican leader Derek Merrin. The initiative mirrors recent moves by Texas and Pennsylvania to establish Bitcoin reserves. On 12 December 2024, Texas Representative Giovanni Capriglione introduced the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act, which proposes that the state comptroller hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset for at least five years. Pennsylvania took a similar step in November, with Representative Mike Cabell proposing a bill to allow its treasury to allocate up to 10% of its balance sheet in Bitcoin, citing the asset’s potential to hedge against economic uncertainty. Furthermore, corporate Bitcoin holders like MicroStrategy and Metaplanet have expanded their Bitcoin holdings. MARA Holdings (MARA) has also bought 11,774 BTC in the latest acquisition, the company announced on X on Dec. 10. Likewise, Riot Platforms, a Bitcoin mining company, announced plans to raise $500 million through a private bond offering to bolster its Bitcoin reserves further.

Rossi claims in a lawsuit filed in San Francisco Superior Court that Akridge exploited his superior knowledge of cryptocurrencies to siphon staking rewards from her digital wallet, according to a report by Bloomberg . Staking, a process that involves pledging cryptocurrency assets to validate blockchain transactions, can yield significant returns in the form of additional tokens. Akridge Reportedly Controlled Her Accounts Rossi’s complaint alleges that Akridge covertly controlled her accounts, reaping all the staking commissions allocated to her. The value of the disputed tokens has been redacted in the court documents, but Rossi has described the amounts involved as “significant.” She has also requested portions of the case remain confidential due to the sensitive financial details. The legal dispute follows the couple’s divorce filing in February 2023 after a decade of marriage. Rossi is seeking damages for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and fraud. NEW: Stephen Akridge, a co-founder of @solanalabs and holder of Solana tokens, a digital asset that has a total market cap of over $90 billion, is facing legal action in San Francisco state court. — Michael A. Mora (@MichaelAdamMora) December 26, 2024 Solana, known for its rapid transaction speeds and growing ecosystem, has been a standout performer in the cryptocurrency market despite earlier setbacks, including its association with Sam Bankman-Fried and the FTX collapse. The platform’s recent resurgence in value has further amplified interest in the tokens at the center of the lawsuit. According to Rossi, Akridge previously worked at Qualcomm Inc. and served as Solana’s principal engineer, collaborating closely with co-founders Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal. The lawsuit proceeds under the title Rossi v. Akridge, CGC-24-620900. Solana DEX Trading Volume Surpasses $100B Solana achieved over $100 billion in decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume for the second consecutive month in December. With a $107.865 billion in monthly DEX volume (as of Dec. 27), Solana outpaced its competitors in December, including Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Ethereum ( ETH ), which recorded $91.444 billion and $84.168 billion. In November, Solana also reigned supreme with $129.736 billion in DEX volume, well ahead of Ethereum’s $70.635 billion. As reported, Solana has overtaken Ethereum as the top destination for new developers in 2024, breaking Ethereum’s eight-year dominance in the space. According to a December 12 report by Electric Capital, Solana saw 7,625 new developers join its ecosystem this year, surpassing Ethereum’s 6,456. The surge was driven largely by increased developer activity in Asia. Notably, Solana also briefly surpassed Ethereum on two significant occasions. On March 18, Solana’s network activity exceeded Ethereum’s due to heightened demand for Solana-based meme coins. Later, on October 28, Solana’s daily network fee generation surpassed Ethereum’s for a 24-hour period. In another incident, earlier this month, prominent blockchain researcher Max Resnick announced that he has shifted from Ethereum infrastructure firm ConsenSys to SOL-focused R&D company Anza. Resnick previously led research at ConsenSys’ Special Mechanisms Group, where he voiced support for alternative scaling models.

His assertions have sparked significant debate, as they challenge widely accepted narratives about the origins of these digital assets. Farina specifically attributes the creation of Bitcoin to the National Security Agency (NSA) and asserts that XRP represents a more refined evolution of blockchain technology. Below, we examine his key points. The creators of BTC also created $XRP . The CIA & NSA deployed BTC to prevent foreign powers from developing similar tech that would dominate digital payments, and make billions. “Satoshi Nakamoto” is an organization. pic.twitter.com/rxtIWN1HZE — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) December 26, 2024 Bitcoin’s Alleged Government Origins Farina argues that Bitcoin was created by the NSA as a “beta test coin”. According to his theory, the pseudonymous “Satoshi Nakamoto” is not an individual but rather an organization linked to intelligence agencies. Farina posits that the major reason for creating Bitcoin was to monitor and control global financial transactions, serving as a precursor to central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). He also highlights Bitcoin’s limitations as a functional currency, emphasizing issues such as high fees, slow transaction speeds, and the reliance on secondary solutions like the Lightning Network to facilitate smaller transactions. Farina concludes that these shortcomings render Bitcoin unsuitable for widespread financial adoption, particularly for CBDCs. XRP as Bitcoin 2.0 Farina claims that XRP was designed to address Bitcoin’s inefficiencies, describing it as “Bitcoin 2.0.” He credits XRP’s co-creators— David Schwartz , Jed McCaleb, and Arthur Brito—with building a more practical and scalable blockchain solution. Farina highlights XRP’s speed, low transaction costs, and ability to handle large-scale financial transactions as key advantages over Bitcoin. He further argues that XRP is uniquely positioned to become the backbone of the global financial system, particularly in the context of CBDCs . Farina asserts that XRP’s regulatory compliance and technical capabilities make it the only digital asset capable of dethroning Bitcoin and facilitating instant, large-scale value transfers. Implications for the Financial System Farina suggests that blockchain technology, including Bitcoin and XRP, is fundamentally aimed at enabling CBDCs. He dismisses the notion that Bitcoin was created to undermine traditional financial systems, framing it instead as a government-controlled experiment. In his view, XRP and similar assets represent the “final product” intended to integrate seamlessly into a revamped global financial system. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Farina also stresses the importance of early adoption. He advises individuals to invest in XRP and other promising digital assets, positioning them as key components of the future financial landscape. He predicts that XRP holders will benefit from opportunities such as lending their holdings to financial institutions and earning yields without selling their assets. Controversial Assertions and Public Reaction Farina’s claims have drawn criticism and skepticism from many within the cryptocurrency community. While the idea of government involvement in Bitcoin’s creation has been discussed in conspiracy theories, there is no concrete evidence for this narrative. While XRP’s capabilities are well-documented, the assertion that it was designed by the same people behind Bitcoin lacks credibility. Farina’s assertions raise important questions about the transparency and governance of blockchain technologies. Regardless of whether his claims hold merit, they underscore the need for continued scrutiny and debate within the cryptocurrency space.

Uniswap CEO Expresses Similar Concerns Uniswap CEO Hayden Adams expressed similar concerns, stating that he hopes the ruling will be overturned through the Congressional Review Act (CRA) or legal challenges. The IRS’s new regulations, unveiled on December 27, mandate brokers to report gross proceeds from digital asset transactions, including cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This expanded scope now includes front-end DeFi platforms and is set to be implemented in 2027. Critics argue that these requirements are ill-suited for the decentralized nature of such platforms, which often lack the infrastructure for traditional reporting. Robin Singh, CEO of crypto tax platform Koinly, warned that compliance could impose significant operational and technical burdens on decentralized businesses. “The decentralized structure of these platforms makes traditional reporting exceptionally challenging,” Singh noted. 5/ If you are a customer of a front-end trading service, expect the following in the future: – Share your KYC info similar to CeFi exchanges during onboarding. – Receive tax forms with only proceeds (you will still have to use a crypto tax software tool to keep track of your… — Shehan (@TheCryptoCPA) December 27, 2024 Bill Hughes, a lawyer at blockchain development firm Consensys, described the ruling as “all cost, no benefit” and criticized its global reach, which demands reporting for both U.S. and international users. He predicted that the regulation would face Congressional review and potential disapproval. Critics also slammed the IRS for releasing the ruling during the holiday season, suggesting an intentional move to limit public response. Jake Chervinsky, Chief Legal Officer at venture capital firm Variant, labeled the rule an “unlawful” measure by the outgoing administration’s “anti-crypto army.” He argued that it could be overturned by the courts or a new administration. Crypto Veterans Call on New Congress to Repeal the Regulations Alexander Grieve of Paradigm called for the new Congress to repeal the regulations through the CRA. “Treasury/IRS just dropped their DeFi broker regs, which impose substantial centralized reporting requirements on DeFi (starting Jan 1, 2027), and hoover up user data to the govt,” he wrote on X. “The new pro-crypto Congress can, and should, roll these back via the CRA process next year.” Miles Jennings, General Counsel at a16z Crypto, accused the IRS of overstepping by redefining “effectuate transactions” to encompass DeFi activity. When you challenge government abuses of power, the response is even more transparent and desperate abuses. The broker reporting rule is an obvious example — A fantastical expansion of the words “effectuate transactions” to enable the IRS to ban DeFi. This despite courts… — miles jennings (@milesjennings) December 27, 2024 Advocacy groups like the Blockchain Association echoed these sentiments, calling the rule a final effort to drive the U.S. crypto industry offshore. “On behalf of the industry, we’re prepared to take aggressive action to fight back. We also look forward to working with the new pro-crypto Congress and Administration to roll back this and other anti-innovation rules.” Kristin Smith, the group’s CEO, emphasized the urgent need for policymakers to reconsider the broader implications of the ruling.

Due to BTC’s steep correction and failure to recover, the outlook for altcoins looks bleak. Although Ripple rallied nearly 500% in the past few weeks, these five signs suggest XRP price could crash to $1 soon. 5 Sell Signals That Suggest XRP Price Could Crash to $1 Let’s explore five sell signals hinting at a drop in XRP price to $1. Due to BTC’s weakness, the crypto market outlook could trigger a crash that impacts even XRP. A plummet in XRP network activity and daily active addresses suggests that investors are not interested in the remittance token. This drop in investor activity could lead to a significant correction. The 365-day MVRV indicator hints at massive unrealized profits, which could trigger a crash if these holders attempt to realize profits. Whales have continued to offload their holdings for the past month. Technicals suggest XRP price could trigger a 31% crash as it hovers inside a descending triangle. General Crypto Market Weakness Affects XRP Price Bitcoin’s 15% drop from ATH of $108,421 caused crypto markets to crumble. Top altcoins, including XRP, that were up massively have retraced most of their gains. Due to altcoins’ high correlation with Bitcoin, they tend to follow the path set by the leader. With BTC showing signs of a further decline, XRP price will also follow suit, potentially tagging the $1 level. Decline in Daily Active Addresses & Network Growth When the network’s growth and daily active addresses drop, it indicates that investors, both new and existing, are not interested in the token at the current price level. This often happens after an uptrend, where both the metrics tank, suggesting an exodus of investors and hints at a potential reversal of Ripple price to $1. XRP DAA, Network Growth Ripple Long-Term Holders’ Massive Unrealized Gains The 365-day MVRV for Ripple stands at 77%, showing that investors who purchased XRP in the past year at an average profit of 77%. During the yearly high, this number stood at 200%. High unrealized gains often become a source of selling pressure if investors decide to book profits. This is the third sign that hints XRP price could crash to $1 again. XRP 365-day MVRV Ripple Whales Sell XRP Between November 29 and December 28, whales holding between 100 K and 1 M XRP offloaded 110 M tokens. This selloff could be another reason why XRP price has crashed 32% from the yearly high of $2.90. If this trend continues, XRP price could crash down to $1. XRP Whales XRP Price Analysis: A Crash to $1 Likely XRP price has formed a descending triangle setup, which contains lower highs and equal lows, connected by trend lines. This setup often leads to bearish breakouts and forecasts a 31% crash to $1.34, obtained by measuring the triangle’s height and adding it to the base at $1.95. For this setup to be successful, XRP price needs to break below the $1.95 support level, which is the triangle’s base. If bulls fail to stabilize Ripple at $1.34, it could trigger a further drop to $1. XRP/USDT 4-hour chart On the other hand, if Bitcoin reverses the bearish outlook, then XRP price could. In such a case, a recovery from $1.34 leading to a breakout above the triangle’s declining trend line will signal a bullish outlook. Such a development could lead to a revisit of $2.90 followed by $3.

This move requires these protocols to disclose Know Your Customer (KYC) information for digital asset transactions. The IRS estimates that up to 875 DeFi brokers could be affected by these new rules, which has quickly triggered a community backlash. In simple terms, the new rules say that certain DeFi platforms, which help people buy and sell digital assets, will now be treated like brokers. On top of that, the proposed KYC details are creating security issues in the investor’s mind and legal experts are strongly objecting to the move stating it as constitutional violation. In response, the IRS stated that this will help make sure people are paying the right taxes. However, many people in the crypto world are worried about these new requirements. Lawsuit Filed to Counter the IRS Rule In place of the controversy, the Blockchain Association, in collaboration with the DeFi Education Fund and the Texas Blockchain Council, has filed a lawsuit against the IRS, challenging the new regulations. Today we’re taking action, filing a lawsuit that argues today’s broker rulemaking violates the Administrative Procedure Act and is unconstitutional.

She is hopeful that Trump’s pro-crypto Congress and Administration will understand the complications of such outreach which suppress innovation. Moreover, the legal community is also not happy with the laws, Jake Chervinsky, chief legal officer at Variant, called the rule “the dying gasp of the anti-crypto army” and urged that it be overturned either by the courts or the new administration. Community Pours Their Support Adding to the sentiments, Miles Jennings, general counsel of a16z Crypto, criticized the rule as an overreach, calling it a “fantastical expansion” of the term “effectuate transactions.” He warned that the new rules could potentially allow the IRS to regulate or even ban DeFi platforms.

Notably, recent market stats indicate that the US Spot BTC ETFs closed the week with $287 million outflows, raising market concerns amid BTC price dip to $94K. In turn, crypto enthusiasts are now thoroughly monitoring the flagship token’s future price movements amid declining institutional interest and recent volatility. Bitcoin ETFs Record $287M In Outflows Raising Market Concerns As per the latest data offered by Farside Investors , Bitcoin ETFs recorded $287.9 million worth of outflows as of December 27. The remarkable outflows, underlining declining institutional interest, have raised severe investor uncertainty amid the market’s current volatility. Data indicated that Fidelity’s FBTC registered $208.2 million in outflows yesterday. Further, even Ark Invest’s ARKB witnessed $112.6 million in outflows. Also, Bitwise’s BITB reported $36 million in outflows, whereas Invesco’s BTCO saw $14.2 million. Besides, it’s also worth mentioning that BlackRock’s IBIT saw $79.4 million in inflows. Nevertheless, data collectively hinted at a considerable decline in institutional interest, raising concerns over the flagship crypto’s future movements. Conversely, CoinGape also reported that BTC ETFs saw $450 million worth of inflows recently, which adds a contrasting tint to the asset’s future movements. The strong inflow suggests that a recovery for Bitcoin may also be possible moving ahead, whilst the current outflows are a direct result of market volatility. What’s Next For BTC? At the time of reporting, BTC price tanked nearly 0.5% intraday and is currently sitting at $94,214. Its 24-hour low and high were $93,310.74 and $97,294.85, respectively. Notably, weekly charts show a 5% drop in value, mirroring a turbulent crypto market whilst also aligning with outflows in Bitcoin ETF. The turbulency aligns with the U.S. Fed’s hawkish stance on rate cuts, with no major macroeconomic events until the next year. However, it’s worth mentioning that BTC whales are buying the dip, as reported by CoinGape. Besides, long-term prospects for the flagship crypto remain optimistic across the broader industry. Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki, a renowned name across the crypto industry, anticipates BTC price hitting $350K by 2025. Overall, despite the outflows and recent market volatility, Bitcoin showcases the potential for further gains ahead.

Calling the decision “idiotic,” Gasparino faced criticism from crypto market enthusiasts and lawyers. His remarks not only sparked controversy but also highlighted differing perspectives on the implications of the case for the crypto industry. XRP News: Lawyer Criticizes Charles Gasparino’s Comment In the latest interview with Anthony Pompliano, Gasparino criticized Judge Torres for allegedly establishing a precedent of lesser disclosure for retail investors compared to institutions. Referring to the judge’s decision as “stupid,” he argued it could harm retail investor protections. However, crypto influencer Tony Edward countered this viewpoint, accusing Gasparino of bias. Edward said Gasparino’s stance suggests that “he wants Ripple to lose. Judge Torres clearly stated secondary market sales are not securities because many investors would not know who the hell Ripple is.” Edward further pointed out that investors in secondary markets often have no ties to Ripple, underscoring the legitimacy of the court’s distinction. In addition, lawyer Bill Morgan offered a different perspective, asserting Gasparino lacks understanding of the case. He emphasized that the ruling only addressed Ripple’s programmatic sales, not all secondary market transactions. Morgan added, “As for Charles Gasparino, it is quite apparent he does not understand XRP or crypto.” Ripple Case In Focus Amid Recent Market Developments Gasparino has consistently criticized the SEC’s approach, accusing the agency of misplaced priorities. He highlighted the leniency shown to figures like Sam Bankman-Fried while Ripple faced aggressive scrutiny. According to him, this selective enforcement reflects regulatory overreach. Despite acknowledging Ripple’s technological potential, Gasparino lamented its forced shift overseas due to unclear U.S. regulations. In the latest XRP news, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse echoed similar frustrations, calling the SEC’s actions an industry-wide threat. He argued that the agency’s failure to provide clear guidance hampers innovation in the U.S. crypto sector. Meanwhile, the focus on the XRP lawsuit intensified with a crucial deadline approaching next month. In addition, speculations are soaring about whether the incoming US SEC Chair will drop the ongoing Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit. Notably, Ripple’s partial victory in 2023 brought relief to the XRP community. The court ruled that secondary market sales of XRP are not securities, separating these transactions from direct institutional sales. However, the re-appeal of the US SEC has further fueled speculations. Despite that, it appears that the market sentiment remained strong, especially as Donald Trump’s election win fueled optimism over a pro-crypto regulatory environment in the US. XRP price also recorded a robust rally since November, before witnessing a volatile trading in recent weeks amid a broader market downturn. However, despite the gloomy sentiment, analysts remained optimistic about the future trajectory of Ripple’s native crypto. In a recent analysis, a top expert even predicted Ripple’s native crypto to soar past the $20 mark ahead.

Investors are strongly advised to exercise caution and conduct their own research. Will BRETT reach $1? Based on the analysis’s critical prediction, BRETT could reach $1 by 2030, with its potential high projected at $1.16. However, given earlier projections, it is unlikely to reach this milestone before 2030. Will BRETT reach $5? BRETT’s near-term goal of reaching $5 seems unlikely. Current predictions suggest it may peak at around $1 by 2030, influenced by crypto market trends and community support. Is Brett listed on Binance? Brett Coin (BRETT) is currently not listed on Binance for trading. Although, it remains available on other exchanges like Bybit, Gate.io , and KuCoin Does BRETT have a good long-term future? BRETT is projected to reach between $0.70 by 2027 and $1 by 2030, depending on market conditions and adoption of the Base network. Its growth is expected to be influenced by cryptocurrency market trends and regulatory developments.

In 2027, the coin could be worth between $37.96 and $44.68, with an average price of $42.95 By 2030, Cosmos (ATOM) might touch $74 Cosmos (ATOM) is a blockchain ecosystem that facilitates interoperability among independent blockchains. Co-founded by Jae Kwon and Ethan Buchman in 2014, Cosmos aims to create a decentralized network of blockchains that can communicate and transact seamlessly. Its main components include the Cosmos Hub, which serves as the central chain, and multiple “zones” that operate under their own rules while connecting to the Hub. The platform uses the Tendermint consensus algorithm and Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol to enable fast low-cost transactions. Fees average around $0.01, and confirmation times are approximately seven seconds. Cosmos employs a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism, allowing users to stake their ATOM tokens for network security and transaction validation. Since its ICO in 2017, Cosmos has raised significant funding and established a growing ecosystem, including notable projects like Terra and Binance. With over 286 million ATOM tokens in circulation and a market cap exceeding $7.7 billion, Cosmos is positioned as a key player in the evolving landscape of blockchain technology, often referred to as the “Internet of Blockchains” for its ambitious goal of connecting diverse blockchain networks Overview Cryptocurrency Cosmos Token ATOM Current Price $6.43 Market Cap $2.51B Trading Volume $480.94M Circulating Supply 390.93M ATOM All-time High $ 44.70 on Sept 19, 2021 All-time Low $1.13 on Mar 12, 2020 24-hour High $6.79 24-hour Low $6.41 Cosmos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Prediction $ 8.60 (32.84%) Volatility (30-day variation) 11.63% 50-Day SMA $7.47 14-Day RSI 45.33 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 74 (Greed) Green Days 16/30 (53%) 200-Day SMA $5.95 Cosmos (ATOM) technical price analysis TL; DR Breakdown: ATOM is bearish at $6.431, with resistance at $9.775 and support at $5.568; RSI near 42 suggests limited buying pressure in the 1-Day chart. In the 4-Hour Chart, it trades at $6.438, below the $6.656 SMA. Resistance at $7.039 and support at $6.273, with weak momentum confirmed by a negative MACD crossover. ATOM/USD 1-Day price chart ATOM 1-Day price chart ; Tradingview On December 28, the 1-day chart for Cosmos (ATOM) shows the price at $6.431, below the 20-day SMA of $7.671, indicating bearish momentum. The chart shows resistance at $9.775 (upper Bollinger Band), while support lies near $5.568 (lower Bollinger Band). The RSI is 42.26, leaning towards the oversold region, suggesting reduced buying strength. Also, the recent downward movement on the chart showcases a cooling period after a prior bullish rally. If the price breaks below $5.568, further declines are expected, while a rebound above the SMA at $7.671 could indicate a recovery. On the other hand, Bollinger Bands suggest increased volatility. Traders need to trade cautiously. ATOM/USD 4-hour price chart ATOM 4-hour price chart ; Tradingview The 4-hour Cosmos (ATOM) chart shows the price trading at $6.438, below the 20-SMA at $6.656, indicating bearish sentiment. Resistance is evident at $7.039 (upper Bollinger Band), while support is at $6.273 (lower Bollinger Band). The Balance of Power (BoP) is -0.39, suggesting sellers have a slight advantage. The MACD line at -0.106 remains below the signal line at -0.096, confirming bearish momentum. A break below $6.273 could trigger further downside, potentially testing lower levels. However, a reversal above $6.656 may pave the way for a recovery toward $7.039. Momentum remains weak, potentially leading to short-term volatility.

Based on the 1-day and 4-hour charts, ATOM/USD is poised for potential downward movement as bearish momentum dominates. On the daily chart, the price is below the 20-SMA, with resistance at $9.775 and support at $5.568, indicating a larger bearish trend. The 4-hour chart also points in the same direction, with the price below $6.656 (20-SMA) and resistance at $7.039. The MACD and RSI signal weak momentum and minimal buying strength. If the price falls below $6.273, further declines toward $5.568 are likely. However, a reversal above $6.656 could spark recovery, targeting the $7.039 resistance. Caution remains amid low momentum. Is Cosmos a good investment? Cosmos (ATOM) shows potential as an investment due to its innovative approach to blockchain interoperability and recent upgrades like ATOM 2.0. Analysts predict long-term price growth, but the crypto market is highly volatile. Investors should conduct their research and consider risks before investing in ATOM. Is Cosmos a Safe Network? The Cosmos network is built on the Tendermint consensus protocol, offering robust security and interoperability features. However, like all blockchain systems, it faces potential risks, requiring users to remain cautious and well-informed about emerging vulnerabilities and challenges. Will Cosmos reach $50? Based on Cosmo’s current market trends and growth projections, Cosmos (ATOM) is expected to reach a value of approximately $50 by 2029. Will Cosmos reach $100? Current predictions suggest that Cosmos (ATOM) will unlikely reach $100 soon. Analysts estimate it would require a significant increase of over 900% to hit that price. Our forecasts place its maximum potential around $73.66 by 2030, indicating limited short-term growth potential. Does Cosmos have a good long-term future? Cosmos (ATOM) promises a strong long-term future, with forecasts indicating significant price increases over the next decade. Analysts predict that ATOM could reach values as high as $74 by 2030, driven by its unique position in the blockchain ecosystem and ongoing developments in interoperability and scalability. The Cosmos Hub is well-established and supported by a dedicated community, enhancing its growth and adoption prospects in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape.

During the bullish market cycle of 2021, Cosmos saw its price peak at over $44, driven by significant investor interest and market optimism. However, following this surge, on 3rd April 2022, the price of Cosmos (ATOM) sharply declined to $6.39. Since then, Cosmos entered a prolonged phase of consolidation, trading within a range between $6.39 and $16 as market dynamics fluctuated. In early 2024, particularly around 8th March, Cosmos encountered significant resistance at the $13 level, struggling to gain momentum above this point. This resistance reflected broader market sentiment and potential selling pressure. By July 2024, ATOM’s price was trading in a narrower range, between $5 and $6, indicating a lack of upward momentum. By August 2024, the price had further dipped to $4.02, suggesting increasing bearish pressure. This recent decline highlights ongoing challenges for Cosmos in maintaining its price stability and suggests potential further downside as market bears dominate, putting pressure on potential buyers to defend against a continued downward trend. On September 2024, the Cosmos price ranged between $4 to $5, and on October 06, the price traded at $4.5837 with a trading volume of $48.48M. On November 5, ATOM was trading at $4.10. By December 5, ATOM’s price surged significantly, trading at $10.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ATOM|BLOCKCHAIN|ICO|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-28 08:49:40

Market participants who entered during the token’s recent rally are experiencing losses, though sentiment remains hopeful. Some prominent crypto analysts suggest that XRP may soon break through this period of consolidation to reach new heights. Conditions for XRP Rally to $4.50 Crypto influencer Ben Armstrong, known as “BitBoy,” has outlined the critical level XRP must surpass to initiate its next significant price rally. In a recent tweet, Armstrong emphasized the importance of XRP closing daily and weekly candles above $2.75. If this condition is met, he believes the digital asset could achieve a rally to $4.50. When $XRP is closing daily and weekly candles above $2.75 it’s time to rock and roll to $4.50 — The BitBoy (@BenArmstrongsX) December 17, 2024 XRP briefly reached $2.72 after Ripple announced the launch of its stablecoin, RLUSD . Many anticipated that this news would catalyze XRP’s price, but the token quickly retraced, largely impacted by Bitcoin’s market downturn. Despite this, Armstrong maintains that reclaiming the $2.75 level remains the key trigger for XRP’s upward movement. He has also suggested that this price target could be reached by the end of the year. XRP’s Path Toward Reclaiming Its All-Time High Adding to the bullish outlook, another prominent crypto analyst named “360 Trader” has presented an even more optimistic perspective. The analyst predicts that XRP is on the verge of recovering its all-time high (ATH) of $3.84 and establishing a strong price base above it. They argue this would provide the foundation for XRP’s “true” bull run, potentially leading to unprecedented price levels. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Sentiment: Optimism vs. Skepticism The broader crypto community continues to monitor XRP’s performance with mixed expectations. Optimists point to potential catalysts, including the anticipated resolution of Ripple’s ongoing legal battle and the possible approval of an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). Both developments are expected to boost market confidence significantly. On the other hand, skeptics caution against overestimating XRP’s potential in the near term. Some predict a possible decline to $0.50 , citing historical patterns and market volatility as key risks. As the end of the year approaches, XRP’s price movement remains a focal point for analysts and investors alike. While the asset has been trading within a narrow range over the past two weeks, key developments and market trends could dictate its next major move. Whether XRP can meet Armstrong’s $2.75 threshold and surge to $4.50, or face further pullbacks, remains to be seen. However, enthusiasts and critics agree that the coming months will be pivotal for the digital asset’s trajectory.

The nation, known for its abundant hydroelectric resources, saw tax receipts from crypto mining fall by 50% compared to the previous year. How Does Kyrgyzstan Tax Crypto Mining? According to a report by the Ministry of Economy and Finance, Kyrgyzstan collected just 46.6 million Kyrgyzstani soms (around $535,000) in mining taxes this year, a significant decrease from the 93.7 million soms ($1.08 million) collected in 2023. The decline was evident early on, with a 29.7% drop in revenue during the first seven months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Kyrgyzstan imposes a 10% tax on the electricity used by crypto miners, which also includes value-added tax (VAT) and sales tax. This taxation model initially helped boost revenue, particularly during the early stages of 2023. Back then, the country reported a dramatic increase in mining taxes, collecting 78.6 million soms ($883,000) in the first few months, far exceeding the 11.1 million soms ($133,200) collected during the same period in 2022. What’s Behind the Decline? The reasons for the sharp drop in mining tax revenue remain unclear. Some suggest that regulatory uncertainties or reduced mining activity may have contributed. Additionally, Kyrgyzstan’s affordable hydroelectric power has made it an attractive place for crypto miners, but recent changes in energy policies or costs may have impacted the sector. New Opportunities for Mining Despite the fall in tax revenue, there are ideas worldwide to improve crypto mining. In Germany, for example, miners use extra renewable energy to power Bitcoin operations, which helps reduce energy waste and stabilize power grids. Countries like Kyrgyzstan could explore similar solutions to boost the sector while supporting their economy. This decline in tax revenue is a challenge for Kyrgyzstan, but it also opens doors to rethink strategies and create a more sustainable future for cryptocurrency mining.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-28 09:00:05

Bitcoin On Track For $185,000 By Year-End 2025 According to Galaxy Research, Bitcoin is poised to exceed $150,000 in the first half of 2025 and may reach or surpass $185,000 by the end of the year. This bullish outlook is underpinned by a combination of increasing institutional, corporate, and nation-state adoption. Historically, Bitcoin has outperformed traditional asset classes, including the S&P 500 and gold, and this trend is expected to continue as it captures approximately 20% of gold’s market capitalization. Related Reading: Chainlink Is Forming A Head-And-Shoulders Pattern – Confirmation Could Take LINK To $14 The report notes that US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) are anticipated to surpass $250 billion in assets under management (AUM) by 2025. With over $36 billion in net inflows recorded in 2024, these ETPs have become the most successful launch cohort in history, attracting investments from major hedge funds and institutional players. As Bitcoin solidifies its position as a leading asset, Galaxy Research forecasts that at least one prominent wealth management platform will recommend a Bitcoin allocation of 2% or more. This shift is expected to further drive inflows into Bitcoin ETPs, increasing their AUM. The report also highlights the likelihood of reaching consensus on significant protocol upgrades among Bitcoin developers, which has historically been difficult to achieve, and is expected to include enhancements that improve transaction programmability. Dogecoin Poised For Resurgence Ethereum is projected to trade above $5,500 in 2025, driven by easing regulatory constraints on decentralized finance (DeFi) and increased institutional interest. Galaxy Research anticipates that Ethereum staking rates will surpass 50%, with the possibility of spot-based ETH exchange-traded funds being allowed to stake a portion of the ETH they hold. The decentralized finance (DeFi) market on Bitcoin is also expected to grow significantly. The amount of Bitcoin locked in DeFi smart contracts could nearly double in 2025, according to the firm.

The report also predicts that Dogecoin will reach a market cap of $100 billion, potentially crossing the $1 mark amidst broader market dynamics, including institutional adoption and new regulatory frameworks that may influence the future of meme-based cryptocurrencies. In the regulatory arena, Galaxy Research anticipates that bipartisan legislation governing stablecoin issuance will be enacted by the end of 2025, providing a clear framework for issuers. At present, BTC is trading at $94,648, showing a 1% loss in the last 24 hours. Ethereum, conversely, is priced at $3,359, reflecting a 1% increase over the same period. Dogecoin is priced at $0.314, experiencing minimal gains of only 0.5% during this timeframe.

Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President there could be shifts in how the SEC handles the case. Gasparino made it clear that, as a reporter, he remains neutral in the crypto debate and will cover the story objectively, regardless of the outcome, as he does not have any personal stake in XRP. “I think there’s a chance it gets reversed and XRP and Ripple’s back on the hook. The SEC may drop the whole thing now that Trump’s in there. That’s a whole other thing you have to worry about. And this is why I get it from both sides, both pro-crypto and anti-crypto,” He Said. Ripple Case Under Paul Atkins There is growing speculation about how the Ripple case could be affected by the incoming SEC chair, Paul Atkins, following the resignation of the current chair, Gary Gensler, on January 20, the same day as President Trump’s inauguration. The SEC’s filing deadline for its appeal is approaching on January 15, after the agency requested a 90-day extension in October, pushing the deadline past the US Presidential Election. The transcripts for the appeal are set to be ordered by December 31 and must be fully delivered by January 30, 2025. March 2025 will be a critical month when the plaintiff will present arguments against Ripple and its CEO, Brad Garlinghouse.

Instead, officials may focus on managing and safeguarding their existing Bitcoin reserve, totaling around 183,850 BTC, worth $17.36 billion, as identified by blockchain analytics platform Spot on Chain. Focus Shifts to Bitcoin Reserve Policy Alex Thorn, Galaxy Digital’s head of research, highlighted that while no direct purchases are anticipated, discussions about a broader Bitcoin reserve policy could gain momentum within federal departments and agencies. Thorn suggested this could involve strategies to solidify Bitcoin as a critical reserve asset for the nation. A significant proposal in this context is Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis’ Bitcoin Act 2024 . If enacted, the legislation would enable the government to systematically acquire 200,000 BTC annually over five years, building a substantial reserve of 1 million Bitcoin to be held for at least 20 years. The potential for such a policy underscores growing recognition of Bitcoin’s role as a strategic asset. Global Ripple Effects of US Bitcoin Strategy The US government’s actions—or inaction—on Bitcoin could have far-reaching implications. Galaxy Digital analyst “JW” pointed out that as Bitcoin continues to gain traction, up to five Nasdaq 100 companies and an equal number of nation-states might integrate Bitcoin into their balance sheets or sovereign wealth funds. JW also warned of a potential race among nations to mine or acquire Bitcoin, especially unaligned nations or those with adversarial relations to the US. “Competition among nation-states, particularly those with significant sovereign wealth or geopolitical ambitions, could accelerate Bitcoin adoption strategies,” JW explained. While some countries, like Japan, remain cautious, others are exploring Bitcoin’s potential as a reserve asset . Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba expressed uncertainty about the global shift toward Bitcoin adoption, noting that Japan was not yet prepared to formalize its stance. Meanwhile, former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao speculated that smaller nations might be the first to adopt Bitcoin reserve, with China possibly leading strategic adoption efforts. As the conversation around Bitcoin reserve intensifies, the US’s next steps will likely shape global attitudes toward cryptocurrency as a financial and geopolitical tool.

Bitcoin enjoyed a spark towards the latter end of 2024, with the asset bursting out after a Trump-fuelled rally. It is no surprise that it did a remarkable job hitting over $100k this year. While Bitcoin did about 50% since November 3, other assets followed suit, with Dogecoin posting double its price. While the crypto assets enjoyed a stellar run towards the end of the year, gold has been dominating, having itself a wonderful year. Prices of the precious metal surged by 28%, pushing financial investors back to the asset as a safe haven amid rising geopolitical and economic tensions. Gold started the year at $2014, having itself a wonderful year amid several highs before hitting $2,719 in late November. Experts predict a wonderful 2025 for gold Usually, most assets in the financial market experience a pullback after a huge rally like gold’s. Investors are conversant with the market, more reason why they remain unfazed by the asset’s recent drop to around $2,603. But with many Western countries starring inflation in the eye amid other geopolitical issues, investors are predicting a great 2025 for gold. Gold Bullion Company’s Managing Director Rick Kanda lauded the asset’s rise in 2024, noting that it was a record year for the asset. “There’s no denying that 2024 has been a record year for gold,” Kanda said. He also made bold predictions about the precious metal heading into the new year. “It’s reached colossal new highs and broken records. This is… a result of economic uncertainty, changes in global inflation , and also increased demand,” he added. Gold has usually done well, especially when investors shift their funds into the asset while relying less on bond markets and equity. The popular notion is that gold also serves other purposes, giving it an inherent value. For instance, aside from its use as a currency, the asset is also used to mark jewelry and other technological products. According to UK-based gold marketplace Bullion Vault, investors are skeptical about the current global situation getting better next year. With Donald Trump preparing to enter the White House , experts are expecting several conflicts. In addition, the platform says it expects its users to consolidate their positions instead of selling. The recent survey carried out by the firm among its users shows that they believe the asset could hit $3,070 by 2025. Most of the respondents cited geopolitical tensions and economic issues driving the growth of the yellow metal. Donald Trump’s Bitcoin crusade amid rising debts With most people using the economic situation and geopolitical tensions as their reasons for holding gold, others are pointing to the increase in sovereign debt. Economies across the West are currently witnessing huge deficits as economic growths continue to mount pressure on countries to increase state spending. This trend had previously emerged in 2007/8 with the pandemic causing it to worsen. Meanwhile, Donald Trump may be relying on his new-found Bitcoin love. With most countries pushing to establish their Bitcoin reserve, the United States is looking to lead the pack. President-elect Donald Trump recently confirmed plans for a national Bitcoin reserve after Bitcoin hit above the $100k mark for the first time. In his speech at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Trump said the United States could do something nice with BTC. He highlighted the need to be ahead of other countries, a notion that the incoming United States President has always echoed. “We’re gonna do something great with crypto because we don’t want China, or anybody else… but others are embracing it, and we want to be ahead,” he said. However, the idea seems not to resonate with everyone as critics have poked holes in the strategy. Skeptics are seeing the move as the United States government playing a fool. They see the strategy as an avenue to run up borrowing costs, which could prove dire for the country. It could worsen the already bad inflation numbers, and the dollar would be at the receiving end. A Bitcoin reserve could also open financial institutions up for Bitcoin adoption, allowing customers to use the asset as collateral for loans. If the asset drops, it could prove costly for the financial institution.

These digital assets, often driven by strong community support and perceived decentralization, are no longer just a laughing matter; they’ve become a force to be reckoned with. As we approach 2025, it’s time to take a closer look at some of the top meme coins by market capitalization that are capturing attention, and possibly, investment. The power of community What sets meme coins apart is their fervent community backing. In many cases, these projects are more influenced by community decisions than other crypto ventures, adding to their perceived decentralization. While the actual level of decentralization is debatable, the fact remains that these coins enjoy massive participation and enthusiasm from their holders. So, with the end of 2024 in sight, let’s explore three meme coins that should be on every crypto-enthusiast’s radar in January 2025. Dogecoin (DOGE): the original meme coin pioneer First up is Dogecoin, the undisputed OG of the meme coin world. Conceived as a lighthearted joke in 2013 by Jackson Palmer, a product manager at Adobe, and Billy Markus, a software developer at IBM, Dogecoin, with its Shiba Inu dog mascot, has become a cultural phenomenon. This open-source, peer-to-peer cryptocurrency, inspired by Litecoin, experienced a massive surge during the 2017 bull run, before declining with the 2018 crash. However, thanks to a very strong community, especially one fronted by Elon Musk, Dogecoin has made a huge comeback. Musk, a vocal proponent of Dogecoin, champions its utility as a low-fee, blockchain-based payment mechanism. The current price of Dogecoin stands at $0.31, with a market cap of $47.2 billion, and it has seen a YTD change of +258%. Dogecoin’s price has surged over 200% since November 2024, making it a top-performing memecoin. While the price has undergone a slight correction, trading near the $0.3 level, a breakout above $0.4 is critical for Dogecoin to regain its bullish momentum. On the downside, the $0.35 level provides significant support, aligned with its 50-day EMA. Shiba Inu (SHIB): the “Dogecoin killer” Next is Shiba Inu, arguably the second most recognizable meme-inspired crypto asset. Launched anonymously by “Ryoshi” in August 2020, Shiba Inu aims to be the “Dogecoin Killer.” Unlike Dogecoin, Shiba Inu is an Ethereum-based altcoin, but it also features a Shiba Inu as its mascot. After a tough 2022, Shiba Inu has shown moderate recovery, following the wider market recovery led by heavyweights like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The coin has a current price of $0.000022, with a market cap of $13.13 billion, and has seen a YTD change of +115.5%. Despite facing a 40% retracement from its December 2024 highs, Shiba Inu’s strong community has remained steadfast, actively supporting the token. The Shiba Inu ecosystem is evolving, with a metaverse where players can interact, earn rewards, and enjoy a decentralized experience. SHIB price needs to surpass the $0.00003 level to spark renewed bullish momentum. Immediate support lies near the 200-day EMA. Pepe (PEPE): the frog’s leap into the memecoin scene Finally, there’s Pepe, a relatively new Ethereum-based meme coin that has quickly surged in popularity. Based on the popular internet meme of a green cartoon frog, Pepe arrived with the promise of overthrowing dog-based meme coins. The project has seen explosive growth since launch, with a current price of $0.000018, a market cap of $7.68 billion, and an impressive YTD change of +1309%. According to its website, Pepe is designed to be the “most memorable memecoin,” with the caveat that it has no intrinsic value or expectation of financial return. Despite this, PEPE has demonstrated a remarkable 400% rally since its launch, even breaking into the top 100 coins for a brief period. Pepe coin’s price has recently corrected, along with other market heavyweights. Currently trading below its 50-day EMA, a breakout above this level and the R1 Fibonacci pivot near $0.000025 is needed to regain momentum. The support zone between the 200-day EMA and the S1 Fibonacci pivot is crucial to prevent further losses.

This marks an impressive 276% increase from $5.1 at the start of the year, showcasing the token’s growing value and utility. As the platform currency of Gate.io, $GT benefits from robust ecosystem support. Holders gain exclusive opportunities to participate in Startup mining, which enables subscriptions to promising new projects. To date, the total cumulative airdrop value distributed through Gate.io’s Startup program has surpassed $120 million, offering users significant rewards and benefits. It’s no surprise many view $GT as a token that provides “double benefits” for its holders. $GT’s total supply is capped at just 300 million tokens, with most already destroyed. This leaves an actual circulating supply of fewer than 100 million tokens. Additionally, Gate.io implements a quarterly buyback and burn mechanism, allocating 15% of its revenue to reduce the circulating supply. This deflationary strategy creates a strong foundation for continued price growth. 最近，平台币表现强劲，我持有的 $GT 也已实现3️⃣倍，昨天更是突破新高。作为 https://t.co/mACJUKt6ZH 的平台币，$GT 不仅享有生态支持的优势，还通过 Startup 挖矿，为持币者提供优先参与高潜力项目认购的机会。截至目前，Startup 累计空投价值已超 1.2 亿美元，可以说“持币即享双重收益”。 $GT … pic.twitter.com/N2bWKpdQ8p — 感悟.eth (@GanWu666) December 27, 2024 Gate.io’s ecosystem is constantly evolving, delivering value and innovation to its users. From the Startup launchpad and Meme Innovation Zone to advanced features like Yubibao, copy trading, and quantitative trading bots, the platform enhances the user experience while driving demand for $GT. With its deflationary tokenomics, high rewards, and a rapidly expanding ecosystem, $GT is positioned for long-term growth. As Gate.io continues to innovate, the future for $GT holders looks brighter than ever. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The altcoins have suffered as well, with many violent price corrections from the likes of AVAX, LINK, SUI, and others. BTC’s Struggles See No End The Fed-induced correction began last week as bitcoin dumped from its latest all-time high of over $108,000 to $92,000 in just a few days. It managed to recover some ground last weekend and even spiked to $99,000, but that was short-lived, and the asset headed straight south on Monday. After another slump toward $92,000, the bull took charge and pushed it to a multi-day peak of just under $100,000. However, this rally was halted quickly as well, and bitcoin started losing value once again in the following days. After failing at $97,000 yesterday, the bears drove it down once more to under $94,000. Although it has been able to recover some ground since then and now trades above that line, BTC is still more than 2% down on the day. Its market capitalization has dumped to $1.870 trillion on CG, and its dominance over the alts has retraced to 54.4%. Bitcoin/Price/Chart 28.12.2024. Source: TradingView Alts in Red Only The alternative coins are deep in red today as well. Ethereum was stopped on a few occasions at $3,500 and is down to $3,360 now. XRP is well below $2.2, while BNB fights to remain above $700. SOL, ADA, DOGE, and TON have produced losses of up to 3%. Even more painful declines come from AVAX, SUI, LINK, DOT, and HBAR. In fact, Chainlink’s token has plummeted by nearly 10% and is deep beneath $22. Most lower- and mid-cap alts are in a similar state as well. Consequently, the total crypto market cap has dumped by $150 billion in the past two days to just over $3.4 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

Polkadot’s price movement has positioned it as a key player in the ongoing bull market , while Bonk’s community-driven growth keeps it in the spotlight. Meanwhile, Lunex Network emerges as a strong contender, capturing investor attention with its potential. This article explores the factors fueling their rise and why they are the focus of market discussions. Lunex Network ’s Growing Influence In The DeFi Space As market sentiments turn bullish, Lunex Network is lauded as a significant player among DeFi platforms, capturing attention from analysts and traders. What sets Lunex Network apart from the competition is its focus on combining technology with user-driven utilities. The platform’s non-custodial wallet and cold storage feature has caused ripples across the decentralized market front. Token holders no longer require third-party custodians of their assets, passwords, and wallet keys. This add-on from Lunex Network clearly aligns with the core values of the crypto movement. Another differentiator is Lunex Network ‘s unified asset tracking that provides users with real-time analytics, simplifying portfolio management and decision-making. This toolset supports novice traders and experts as they navigate the crypto market. In the near term, Lunex Network could stand shoulder to shoulder with other well-known projects, with an exciting future ahead of it. DOT Expected To Catapult By 100% In Near Term Polkadot’s price is trading above $7, reflecting a solid 20% increase over the past month. DOT has maintained stability above its key support level of $6.8, while resistance at $7.2 remains a crucial hurdle for further upward movement. With 16 green days in the past month, DOT currently trades above its 200-day SMA. DOT ’s cross-chain interoperability remains a significant driver of its adoption, with parachain auctions continuing to fuel ecosystem expansion. The MACD level and moving averages indicate a consolidation phase for DOT , which could precede a breakout. Per analysis , DOT is forecasted to rise by 97% and hit $14 in the coming weeks. BONK Burn Event Sparks Excitement In Meme Community Bonk ( BONK ) is experiencing renewed interest after announcing a 1 trillion BONK burn in a BURNmas event . This strategic move has sparked excitement among the community and investors, leading to its appearance in the top gainers list. BONK is currently trading 1,412.30% above the 200-Day SMA as the doggo-themed coin closes in on top 50 status. Technical indicators suggest a short-term bullish trend, with BONK aiming to retest its previous highs. According to crypto analysts like CoinCodex, the price of BONK is predicted to rise by 228% and reach $ 0.0001 before February 2025. If BONK continues to build on its community engagement and market activity, it could sustain its upward momentum. Conclusion The $LNEX presale is now live, with tokens available for just $0.0048 each. In addition to a deflationary system, presale investors who hold LNEX tokens for a minimum of 30 days can earn up to 18% APY in income.

Bitcoin’s current value is near $94,000, highlighting the volatility as the year draws to a close. Amidst this uncertainty, the question arises: Is it feasible to transform $1,000 into $10 million in crypto trading by January? Can $1K Turn into $10M in Crypto Trading by January? The prospect of escalating a mere $1,000 investment to an astounding $10 million by January 2025 captivates many in the crypto market sector. Despite the prevalent bearish trends that many crypto news are experiencing, the inherently volatile market conditions suggest. Such a dramatic increase isn’t out of the realm of possibility during a bullish phase. Investors remain hopeful for a market recovery, eyeing significant gains. SPX6900 (SPX) SPX6900 (SPX), a blockchain-based cryptographic token, has recently shown significant promise for diverse scientific uses. Currently priced at $0.799, SPX has climbed 5% in the last day. Over the past month, its value has increased by over 30%. This growth positions SPX6900 as a standout investment. Investors speculate whether turning a $1,000 stake into $10 million by early January could be feasible. As January approaches, many view SPX6900 as a strategic opportunity to amplify initial investments dramatically.

Set to list at $0.0505, DexBoss aims to enhance the DeFi landscape by integrating centralized exchange features into its decentralized platform. The project employs a deflationary strategy, utilizing a buyback-and-burn approach to increase scarcity and potential value for its users. With a capped supply and projected rising demand, DexBoss positions itself as a promising crypto trading investment for those exploring opportunities in decentralized finance. This model supports the project’s goal of sustaining investor interest over the long term. BabyDoge (BABYDOGE) BabyDoge, a leading meme coin on the BNB chain, was originally created as a humorous take with a serious aim to promote animal adoption awareness. This token gained a significant pop culture boost following a tweet from Elon Musk, earning it the status of an endearing symbol. Baby Doge’s main purpose is to cultivate an engaging meme community that champions animal welfare and encourages pet adoption. Presently, it is valued at $0.00000003228, showing an impressive monthly increase of 35.78%. This recent spike in value brings up an intriguing question: this could lead to investing $1,000, realistically turn into $10 million by the beginning of January. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin (DOGE), a meme-based cryptocurrency , has witnessed an impressive 280% surge in its value over the past year. Currently, the price of DOGE stands at $0.316, marking a modest 1% growth in the last 24 hours. This increase consolidates its position as a top crypto trading investment choice for January. Notably, a significant uptick in large-scale transactions exceeding $100,000 has occurred. This rise in whale activity, aligning with the coin’s price spike, signals robust interest from major investors. These large strategic purchases likely influence Dogecoin’s market dynamics and drive its ongoing momentum.

AMP price analysis gives out a bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. Cryptocurrency value has depreciated to a low of $0.00776 over the last 24 hours. AMP coin has devalued up to 2.91% amidst the growing downside. The red candlestick on the one-day price chart marks a downward momentum. Technical indicators give out a neutral verdict regarding the current market scenario. Whereas the price charts confirm a rising bearish activity for the day. Is AMP a good investment? AMP has been struggling with a bearish trend for the past few months. Despite this, its strong fundamentals suggest it could be a solid long-term investment. Crypto analysts suggest that the approaching weeks can steadily increase the cryptocurrency’s value. A bullish rally may be expected in the latter part of this year (2024), potentially pushing the AMP above $0.01. Why is AMP down? AMP’s price has decreased today. Additionally, the coin has experienced a loss of 2.91% if observed over the last 24 hours. The price is trading at $0.00776 as the coin is under a bearish spell for now, moreover, the bears remained on the lead this week. Will AMP reach $0.010? AMP’s resistance level is at $0.005; yet, a break above this level is possible if sufficient buying momentum builds. A break near or above $0.010 will require a more robust push but isn’t impossible, as the coin achieved this level on March 12, 2024. Will AMP reach $1? Amp has never spiked above the $0.12 level. Even this price mark was observed only once at the start of the token’s launch, and AMP has never seen this level. It seems highly unlikely for AMP to achieve $1 soon. Will AMP reach $10? According to Cryptopolitan’s price prediction, AMP will not achieve this level in the next 10 years until something unusual happens. Considering AMP’s current market cap of only $204 million, the scenario seems almost impossible. Does AMP have a good long-term Future? Amp is trading near its average price level if observed over the longest price period levels. It can be a good long-term investment, as its price will double in 2025 and reach $0.068 by 2030.

Following a rejection at $30, LINK has corrected 27% testing crucial support levels at $22. On the other hand, LINK whales have been accumulating at every price dip highlighting bullishness among long-term players. Where is Chainlink Price Moving Next? Chainlink is seeing strong selling pressure with the LINK price today correcting by another 5.7% in the last 24 hours and is currently trading at $21.36 with a market cap of $13.63 billion. The Coinglass data shows a 12% drop in the LINK open interest to $551 million. Also, the 24-hour liquidations have soared to $3.02 million of which $2.83 million is in long liquidation. Popular crypto analyst Solberg Invest has flagged a potential head-and-shoulders pattern forming on Chainlink’s (LINK) chart, suggesting the possibility of a price decline. The analyst noted that if the Chainlink price breaches the pattern’s neckline, the token could target $16.6, with a worst-case scenario seeing a drop to $12.5. This technical formation adds a cautious note to LINK’s outlook, urging traders to monitor the market closely for further developments. Source: Solberg Invest Despite this short-term bearishness, crypto investors continue to remain bullish for the long term. As per the CoinCodex data, 62% of investors believe that the LINK price can shoot up to $35 in the next month and further to $40 over a three-month period. This means that LINK investors can mint nearly 100% gains by the end of Q1 2025. Having said that, it appears that Chainlink could witness a strong rebound ahead if bulls regain momentum. Besides, a recent LINK price prediction showed that the crypto is likely to hit $44 by next month, which has fueled market sentiment. LINK Whale Accumulation on the Rise Blockchain analytics firm Santiment reports that Chainlink price has experienced a major retracement in the latter half of December, mirroring trends across the broader crypto market. Despite the decline, key active whales holding between 1 million and 10 million LINK have taken advantage of the dip to accumulate. As per data from Santiment, these influential holders have added 3.58 million LINK – valued at approximately $76.9 million – over the past three days. Such whale activity is often considered a bullish indicator, suggesting potential long-term support for LINK’s price trajectory. Source: Santiment With the LINK whale continuing to withdraw their assets, the exchange reserves have taken a significant dip. According to data from CryptoQuant, the exchange reserve dropped to 161.5 million highlighting a shift in market dynamics, with large investors moving their holdings away from exchanges.

Overall, cryptocurrency market capitalisation dropped approximately 2.6% to $3.46 trillion by late Friday after hitting a weekly high of $3.6 trillion after Christmas day. A risk-off sentiment prevailed across the market due to a lack of any solid catalysts, and the market lull intensified towards the middle of the week, with liquidity and trading volumes dipping as a result of the holiday season. Early week profit taking by long-term holders and poor performance of US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds kept market sentiment subdued, with the effect spilling over to the altcoin market as well. The crypto fear and greed index had dropped to neutral levels around the low 50s, confirming the lack of momentum in the market. By the end of the week, only a handful of the top tokens managed to retain gains from the post-election rally that began after Donald Trump won the 2024 US elections. Even though some whale buying and institutional activity returned towards the end of the week, analysts remained cautious, with many expecting a deeper correction scenario to play out. Will Bitcoin rise again? Bitcoin showed some late-week resilience after a $14.2 billion options expiry with a ‘max pain’ point of $85,000, which initially had traders anticipating a major correction. However, the flagship cryptocurrency managed to hold above key support levels and even peaked above $97,330 at 9:06 a.m. UTC on Dec. 27, just an hour after the expiry event. Yet, a prominent trader on TradingView pointed to BTC’s negative correlation with the USDT Dominance Index, which measures USDT’s overall market share. Notably, the metric shows signs of a rebound, which is typically seen when BTC hits a local top. Basically, this rebound indicates a capital flight to safety as liquidity moves to Tether when traders expect volatility or further downside pressure. The analyst warns that a potential bulltrap scenario might be playing out soon where the bellwether sees a short spike before quickly correcting. He urged caution as the sudden rise could mislead many into believing the up trend has resumed again. Some other forecasts see Bitcoin dropping towards the $80 – $60k range in the coming days. According to Mark Newton, managing director at Fundstrat, Bitcoin will target price levels as high as $250,000 next year but could correct to as low as $60,000 before that happens. Fellow analyst Benjamin Cohen also expects a similar drop but notes it could be a flash crash on the day Donald Trump takes office , drawing parallels with past performance of the Invesco QQQ Trust as current BTC price action is showing similarities. Meanwhile, analyst Ali Martinez believes Bitcoin needs to hold above $93,806, or else it could risk dropping towards $70k, pointing to factors such as increased BTC transfers to exchanges and increased profit taking. However, a sustained close above $97,300 or a daily close above $100k would invalidate this scenario. At the time of writing, the leading crypto exchanged hands at $94,171, down 2.7% over the past week. A more pronounced drop was seen for several altcoins, but the top performers managed to pull in notable gains over the week. Top altcoins this week Bitget token Bitget (BGB) outperformed the market with an over 100% rally over the past week. The altcoin boasted a market cap of over $11.3 billion, making it the largest altcoin on the list. Source: CoinMarketCap BGB continued to capitalise on the hype generated by several developments that were unveiled over the course of December. Most recently, the altcoin got a boost after the Seychelles-based crypto exchange announced it would merge BGB with the Bitget Wallet Token (BWB) into a single utility token. Prior to that, the exchange’s planned collaboration with the Tron blockchain and its meme coin launcher, SunPump, acted as a catalyst for the past week’s rally. Virtuals protocol Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) was one of the best-performing artificial intelligence-focused cryptocurrencies, with gains of over 44% recorded in the past week. On the yearly time frame, the gains are locked in at over 23,000%, making it one of the best-performing tokens this year. Source: CoinMarketCap VIRTUAL rode the AI agent wave and the broader growth in the AI sector. As a decentralised AI agent network, the protocol has drawn in a plethora of users over the past year to launch such agents. With the number of AI agents increasing on the platform, users have locked in VIRTUAL tokens, leading to a surge in its price. When writing, VIRTUAL held a market cap of $3.36 billion. Movement Movement (MOVE), an Ethereum layer 2 network, rallied 27% this week to hit a market cap of over $2.3 billion late Friday, just weeks after launching earlier in the month. Source: CoinMarketCap MOVE surged amid excitement surrounding its mainnet beta launch and token generation event (TGE) on December 9. 1 billion tokens were distributed as a part of the TGE, which led to increased trading activity. The price rally got a major boost after the network integrated Wrapped Bitcoin on December 19, bringing more liquidity towards its decentralised finance ecosystem. Alongside this, on-metric shows increased activity on the network with a surge in active addresses on the network.

Lee Sang-jun, the former CEO of Bithumb, was sentenced to two years in prison, while Ahn Sung-hyun, a well-known golfer married to actress Song Yu-ri, received a four-and-a-half-year sentence. Altcoin Price Manipulation and Bribes The trial, held on December 26, revealed surprising details about how these individuals attempted to rig the cryptocurrency market . Prosecutors revealed that Lee , in exchange for large bribes, agreed to list a specific altcoin on Bithumb’s platform. In return, Lee received around 3 billion Korean won (roughly $2 million) in cash, along with luxury watches, high-end bags, and even exclusive restaurant memberships. The bribes were given by Kang Jong-hyun, a reclusive businessman and close associate of both Lee and Ahn. His goal was to artificially boost the value of a low-cap altcoin by listing it on Bithumb, causing its price to rise quickly. Golfer Ahn’s Role in the Scam Ahn Sung-hyun played a key role in the plot as well. Businessman Kang provided Ahn with a large sum of money to bribe Lee into listing the altcoin. However, Ahn didn’t stop there. Prosecutors discovered that Ahn kept some of the money for himself and used it to buy stocks. In total, Ahn pocketed 2 billion Korean won (about $1.5 million), which he spent to make personal investments. The court was harsh on Ahn, describing them as “heinous” and accusing him of using stolen funds to further his financial interests. Ahn’s ties to both Lee and Kang played a central role in the crime, revealing a dangerous web of corruption. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Hacks This Week: Pudgy Penguins Phishing Scam Leads the Pack , Kang’s Secret Ownership of Bithumb Kang, the businessman behind the bribes, was sentenced to one and a half years in prison.

His efforts to manipulate altcoin prices on the exchange were key to this bribery scheme. The case highlights the darker side of the crypto world, where unregulated markets can be easily manipulated for personal profit. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

IBIT's shares also trade at a marginal discount to its premium, and is the only spot Bitcoin ETF that trades at a discount to its premium as compared to peers. On a borad level, institutional demand for Bitcoin ETFs surged, with IBIT managing ~$53 billion, nearly half of the total spot Bitcoin ETF AUMs. The long-term bullish outlook on Bitcoin remains intact, with an expected price ascent through 2025; IBIT trades at a marginal discount, making it attractive. Investment Thesis Last month, Bitcoin finally broke out from the tight trading pattern it held for 7 months on the back of the U.S. election results. This led to the digital asset creating a new ATH record of $106k, backed by the optimism surrounding the pro-Bitcoin stance the incoming U.S. administration is expected to adopt. The bullishness in Bitcoin led to robust inflows into the spot Bitcoin ETFs, which also created their new records. For example, net inflows into Bitcoin ETFs recently crossed $100 billion in AUM and have also overtaken gold AUMs, signaling a strong shift in appetite for Bitcoin as an alternative asset that deserves allocation in portfolios. The price of Bitcoin has pulled back since creating the $106k ATH a few weeks ago, and I believe the digital asset is currently in a consolidation phase with long-term bullish indicators remaining intact. Given my optimism for Bitcoin, I continue to recommend BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (NASDAQ: IBIT ) as the primary vehicle to hold Bitcoin for those investors who prefer Bitcoin exposure via ETFs over digital wallets. IBIT is now the largest spot Bitcoin ETF available, sees healthy inflows, and is cheaper relative to its peers, making this recommendation an easy Buy. IBIT Is The Cheapest ETF Available - See Its Premium To NAV My overall outlook on Bitcoin is bullish, and I continue to expect Bitcoin to move higher through next year on the back of improved price discovery and elevated demand rising not just from retail investors but also institutional buyers. In my last note on IBIT, I explained why IBIT presented itself “as a stable alternative for investors looking to invest in Bitcoin without the bells and whistles that come with directly investing in Bitcoin.” In that note, I talked about strong retail interest, which was driving momentum in spot Bitcoin ETFs such as IBIT, and how the Bitcoin halving that occurred earlier this year would eventually lead to decelerating Bitcoin supply and higher prices. Heavy institutional demand in spot Bitcoin ETFs has led to surging asset volumes for Bitcoin ETFs, leading to one of the sharpest spikes in AUMs among spot Bitcoin ETFs. 21Shares, an ETP firm that specializes in crypto-based ETFs/ETPs and partners with ARK on certain crypto ETFs in the US, issued a report last month where they noted that: Institutions strategically accumulated more bitcoin ETF shares during Q3 than they did in Q2, indicating sustained confidence among major institutional investors. 21Shares compiled data from Bloomberg and noticed that not only was Bitcoin ETF AUM from institutional investors rising, but so was the volume of institutional investors, which was behind the rapid ascent of Bitcoin ETF AUM this year. Separate research showed that Bitcoin ETFs collectively crossed over $100B in AUM, surpassing gold ETFs AUM as well. Exhibit A: Bitcoin ETFs surpassed gold-backed ETFs this year in terms of assets managed. (K33 Research) At the time of writing this note, the value of AUM in all spot Bitcoin ETFs totaled $112.6 billion. This is a remarkable feat these ETFs have been able to achieve, considering that 11 months ago most of these Bitcoin ETFs never existed. Exhibit B: Total Bitcoin ETF AUM trends through 2024 show growth stacked at the start and end of the year. (coinglass) Compared to all the Bitcoin ETFs, State Street’s SPDR Gold Trust (NYSEARCA: GLD ), the most popular gold ETF, has $73.3 billion in assets managed. Given that most gold ETFs, such as GLD, had a ~2-decade head start, the appreciation in AUMs by spot Bitcoin ETFs has marked a turning point in expandable appetite for Bitcoin ETFs. Leading the charge for Bitcoin ETFs is BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, which is now the largest Bitcoin ETF by assets managed. With ~$53 billion in assets, IBIT is the largest spot Bitcoin ETF available to investors, surpassing its predecessor, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust ETF (NYSEARCA: GBTC ). Via IBIT, BlackRock continues to offer investors a stable and relatively cheap alternative for investors to get exposure to Bitcoin. IBIT’s $53 billion in assets managed also means IBIT’s assets account for almost half of the total ~$112 billion spot Bitcoin ETF AUMs I mentioned earlier. Exhibit C: Top Bitcoin ETFs ranked versus BlackRock’s IBIT Bitcoin ETF, ordered by AUM (Author's compilation of top Bitcoin ETFs) Clearly, from Exhibit C, I note that IBIT is the largest spot Bitcoin ETF by AUM and still has comparative ETF fees of just 0.25%, which is within the range of its peer ETFs, barring Grayscale’s GBTC ETF on the high end and BTC ETF on the low end of the fee spectrum. As can also be seen from Exhibit C, the YTD returns for most ETFs, barring Grayscale’s ETFs, fall within the ~104% average returns for the year. All the ETFs that I mentioned above in Exhibit C do trade at a premium to their NAV, which might put off some investors as they wait for a better entry point. Still, for those investors who have a bullish outlook on the underlying asset, Bitcoin, these nuances of ETFs don't really matter. But for those who are looking to deploy more capital, IBIT appears to be trading at a much more affordable premium as compared to its peers, as seen in Exhibit D below. Exhibit D: BlackRock’s IBIT trades at a much more affordable premium to its NAV as compared to the other top spot Bitcoin ETFs. (yCharts) Per the chart above, IBIT is trading at a razor-thin discount to its NAV as compared to its peers, which trade at razor-thin premiums as compared to their NAV. But as I mentioned earlier, as long as investors maintain a bullish outlook on Bitcoin, these specifics really do not matter for the average investor. My 2025 Outlook On Bitcoin Is Still Positive I had noted in my previous note on IBIT how halvings tend to be eventually positive for the price discovery of Bitcoin, leading to higher prices for the digital asset. With this year’s halving in April complete, we are now on our way to the fifth halving, and Bitcoin’s price ascent so far still looks on par if I look at the previous price trends since their respective halvings. Exhibit E: Bitcoin still has enough room to continue its ascent higher and should follow the price trajectories of its previous Bitcoin halvings. (glassnode) As noted by the fifth epoch, or cycle, in black in the chart above, we should continue to experience a higher price trajectory in Bitcoin, and I anticipate that to happen through the course of 2025. Additionally, global liquidity cycles also should get better through 2025, which is a strong indicator for Bitcoin to continue performing through next year. The chart below does indicate some compression in liquidity, but I view that as seasonal, and I expect the reversal in liquidity through next year, which should keep the momentum in Bitcoin and other Bitcoin ETFs such as IBIT. Exhibit F: elevated levels of Global liquidity bodes well for Bitcoin’s prices. (bGeometrics) Risks & Other Factors To Consider As I noted in the previous section, liquidity cycles globally tend to compress around the end of the year and the start of the new year. But in my opinion, these cycles usually will pick up unless there is a recession or severe global event that causes headwinds for global liquidity. In such cases, as we witnessed in Q1 2022, Bitcoin will face pressure and severe volatility. Another marginal headwind investors should note here is that 2025 could see an entire new suite of crypto-focused ETF products being pushed into the market. Last month, option-related products for many spot Bitcoin ETFs, including IBIT, started trading on markets. These option products come after Ethereum-based ETFs were launched mid-year. Bitwise has also filed an S-1 to launch an ETF that offers exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum . There are more crypto products in the pipeline, which I expect will compete for crypto allocation of portfolio capital. This might put short-term pressure on Bitcoin. But, over the long term, these products harbor more opportunity for general crypto adoption, which is long-term positive for Bitcoin. Takeaway IBIT remains a strong ETF candidate for investors to allocate capital towards if they are interested in gaining or adding incremental exposure to Bitcoin via ETFs. The long-term indicators remain intact for Bitcoin to continue its ascent higher through 2025, and I expect ETFs such as IBIT to be beneficiaries of Bitcoin’s price ascent. The ETF also trades at a marginal discount to many of its ETF peers, which makes IBIT relatively attractive. I continue to recommend my Buy rating on IBIT.",IBIT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-12-28 10:07:26

A Comprehensive Islamic Perspective,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/forex-trading-halal-or-haram/,"Forex Trading: Halal or Haram? A Comprehensive Islamic Perspective Forex trading has become a popular financial activity globally, offering opportunities to earn profit by trading currencies. However, for Muslims, the question arises: Is forex trading halal or haram? The answer to this question lies in understanding Islamic financial principles and how they apply to forex trading. In this article, we will explore the Islamic perspective on forex trading, the factors that make it halal or haram, and how Muslims can participate in forex trading ethically. What Is Forex Trading? Forex trading, also known as foreign exchange trading, involves buying and selling currency pairs in the global currency market to make a profit. Traders speculate on the price movements of currencies like USD, EUR, GBP, and JPY, aiming to capitalize on their value fluctuations. Forex trading operates 24/5 and is driven by global events, market trends, and economic indicators. The forex market’s leverage, liquidity, and profit potential attract traders worldwide, including those from Islamic communities. The Islamic Perspective on Forex Trading Islamic finance operates under specific guidelines to ensure all financial transactions are ethical, transparent, and free from prohibited activities. These principles are derived from Shariah law , and any form of trade or investment must comply with the following criteria: 1. Prohibition of Riba (Interest) Interest-based transactions are strictly forbidden in Islam. In traditional forex trading, interest may be incurred through overnight positions or swap rates, which contradict Islamic principles. 2. Gharar (Uncertainty and Speculation) Islam discourages excessive uncertainty and speculative transactions, which are prevalent in forex trading. Contracts must be clear and transparent to avoid exploitation or unfair practices. 3. Haram Activities Investments must not involve haram (forbidden) industries or activities, such as alcohol, gambling, or unethical businesses. 4. Immediate Settlement In Islamic finance, trades must involve the immediate transfer of goods or services. This principle raises questions about the legitimacy of delayed settlements in forex trading. When Is Forex Trading Considered Halal? Forex trading can be deemed halal if it complies with Islamic principles. To ensure halal forex trading, the following conditions must be met: 1. No Riba (Interest-Free Accounts) Forex brokers offering Islamic forex accounts ensure that no interest is charged or earned on overnight positions. These accounts are designed for Muslim traders, eliminating swap rates or interest charges. 2. Transparency in Contracts All transactions should be clear, transparent, and free from ambiguity. The terms of the trade, including profit and loss potential, must be explicitly defined. 3. No Speculative Gambling Forex trading should not resemble gambling. Instead, traders must base their decisions on analysis, research, and market understanding rather than blind speculation. 4. Immediate Execution Forex trades should involve the instant exchange of currency. Contracts that delay settlement or involve deferred payments are not compliant with Islamic principles. When Is Forex Trading Considered Haram? Forex trading is considered haram if it involves activities that contradict Shariah principles. Here are common scenarios where forex trading is deemed haram: 1. Earning Interest (Riba) If a trader earns or pays interest on overnight positions, it violates Islamic laws, making the trade haram. 2. Excessive Speculation (Gharar) Trading purely based on speculation or without proper analysis can be likened to gambling, which is forbidden in Islam. 3. Trading with Leverage While leverage allows traders to control larger positions with smaller investments, it often involves borrowing, which may include interest payments, rendering it non-compliant. 4. Haram Activities or Industries Investing in or benefiting from haram industries through forex trading is strictly prohibited. Islamic Forex Accounts: A Solution for Ethical Trading To cater to Muslim traders, many brokers now offer Islamic forex accounts . These accounts align with Shariah principles by eliminating interest-based transactions and ensuring ethical practices. Key Features of Islamic Forex Accounts: No Swap Fees: Swap rates or rollover fees are removed for overnight positions. Transparent Contracts: Terms are clear and straightforward. Ethical Trading: Brokers comply with halal trading practices, avoiding haram activities. Popular Brokers Offering Islamic Accounts: Exness XM IC Markets Pepperstone Before opening an Islamic forex account, traders should verify the broker’s credentials and Shariah compliance. Scholarly Opinions on Forex Trading Islamic scholars have diverse opinions regarding forex trading. While some consider it haram due to its speculative nature and involvement of interest, others believe it can be halal if conducted under specific conditions. Support for Halal Forex Trading: Scholars argue that forex trading, when done with Islamic accounts, eliminates haram elements like riba. Proper analysis and risk management ensure that trading does not become speculative gambling. Criticism of Forex Trading: Critics highlight the high-risk nature of forex trading, which can resemble gambling. The use of leverage and delayed settlements are common concerns. How to Trade Forex Halal? A Step-by-Step Guide If you’re a Muslim trader aiming to trade forex ethically, follow these steps: Step 1: Choose a Shariah-Compliant Broker Select a broker offering Islamic forex accounts to ensure your trades are free from interest. Step 2: Learn the Market Educate yourself about forex trading fundamentals, technical analysis, and market trends to make informed decisions. Step 3: Avoid Speculation Base your trades on thorough research and analysis instead of gambling or guesswork. Step 4: Use Proper Risk Management Implement stop-loss and take-profit levels to minimize risks and protect your capital. Step 5: Trade Ethically Ensure that your trades involve immediate execution and do not violate Islamic principles. Forex Trading Alternatives for Muslim Investors If you’re unsure about forex trading’s halal status, consider alternative investment options: 1. Stocks (Halal Stocks) Invest in Shariah-compliant companies listed on Islamic stock indices like Dow Jones Islamic Market Index. 2. Sukuk (Islamic Bonds) Sukuk provides returns without earning interest, making it a halal investment option. 3. Real Estate Investing in properties offers stable, long-term returns and complies with Islamic principles. Advantages and Risks of Halal Forex Trading Advantages: Ethical Compliance: Trade with peace of mind knowing your investments align with your faith. Access to Global Markets: Participate in one of the world’s largest financial markets. Financial Opportunities: Leverage forex trading to diversify your investment portfolio. Risks: Market Volatility: Forex markets can be unpredictable and risky. High Leverage: Even with Islamic accounts, using leverage can lead to significant losses. Complexity: Forex trading requires a deep understanding of market dynamics. Conclusion: Is Forex Trading Halal or Haram? The halal or haram status of forex trading depends on how it is conducted. By eliminating interest, avoiding speculation, and adhering to Shariah principles, forex trading can be considered halal. However, traders must exercise caution, choose Shariah-compliant brokers, and trade ethically to ensure compliance with Islamic laws. For Muslims interested in exploring forex trading, Islamic forex accounts offer a viable solution. Always consult with knowledgeable scholars or Islamic finance experts if you have doubts about the permissibility of forex trading.

38222390,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=115359,1735381751,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,How to Trade Gold in Forex: A Comprehensive Guide,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/how-to-trade-gold-in-forex/,"How to Trade Gold in Forex: A Comprehensive Guide Trading gold in the forex market offers a unique opportunity for traders to diversify their portfolios and take advantage of gold’s status as a safe-haven asset. With its deep historical roots and strong connection to global economic trends, gold (traded as XAU/USD ) has become a favorite among forex traders. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to successfully trade gold in the forex market. Why Trade Gold in Forex? Gold trading has gained immense popularity among forex traders due to its benefits and dynamic nature. Here’s why gold stands out: 1. Safe-Haven Asset Gold is often considered a hedge against inflation, currency devaluation, and economic uncertainty. During times of financial instability, investors flock to gold, causing its price to rise. 2. High Liquidity The gold market is one of the most liquid in the world, making it easier for traders to execute trades with minimal slippage. 3. Diversification Trading gold allows forex traders to diversify their portfolios and reduce risk by not solely relying on currency pairs. 4. Strong Correlation with USD Gold is typically priced in U.S. dollars, and its price often inversely correlates with the strength of the dollar. This correlation offers additional trading opportunities. How to Start Trading Gold in Forex Step 1: Understand the Basics of XAU/USD Gold is traded as XAU/USD in the forex market. XAU represents one troy ounce of gold, while USD is the U.S. dollar. The price of XAU/USD reflects how many dollars are required to purchase one ounce of gold. Step 2: Choose a Reliable Broker To trade gold, you’ll need a broker that offers XAU/USD trading. Look for brokers with: Tight spreads Fast execution Access to advanced charting tools Regulation by reputable financial authorities Step 3: Analyze the Gold Market Gold prices are influenced by various factors, including: Economic Data: GDP reports, unemployment rates, and inflation data. Central Bank Policies: Interest rate decisions and monetary policy statements. Geopolitical Events: Wars, trade disputes, and political instability often boost gold prices. Strategies for Trading Gold in Forex 1. Trend Following Gold often exhibits strong trends, making it an ideal asset for trend-following strategies. Use moving averages (e.g., 50-day and 200-day) to identify trends. Enter trades when the price crosses above or below the moving average. 2. Breakout Trading Gold frequently experiences price consolidations followed by significant breakouts. Identify key resistance and support levels. Use volume indicators to confirm breakouts. 3. News Trading Gold prices are sensitive to economic and geopolitical news. Monitor economic calendars for significant events like Federal Reserve announcements. Trade based on anticipated reactions to news, such as interest rate cuts or geopolitical tensions. 4. Hedging with Gold Gold can be used to hedge against currency risks in your forex portfolio. For example, if you hold USD-based assets and anticipate a dollar decline, buying XAU/USD can offset losses. Technical Analysis for Gold Trading Key Indicators for Gold Trading Relative Strength Index (RSI): Identifies overbought or oversold conditions. Fibonacci Retracement Levels: Helps determine potential support and resistance levels. Bollinger Bands: Measures volatility and identifies breakout opportunities. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence): Signals potential reversals and trends. Chart Patterns to Watch Double Bottoms/Double Tops: Often signal reversals in gold’s price direction. Triangles: Indicate potential breakouts, either bullish or bearish. Head and Shoulders: Suggest trend reversals, particularly in trending markets. Fundamental Analysis for Gold Trading 1. U.S. Dollar Strength Gold and the U.S. dollar generally have an inverse relationship. A strong dollar often leads to lower gold prices and vice versa. 2. Inflation Rates High inflation erodes currency value, increasing gold’s appeal as a store of value. 3. Central Bank Actions Central banks are significant players in the gold market. Increased gold purchases by central banks often boost prices. 4. Geopolitical Risks Events like wars or economic sanctions typically drive demand for gold, pushing prices higher. Risk Management in Gold Trading 1. Set Stop-Loss Orders Protect your capital by placing stop-loss orders at strategic levels. 2. Use Proper Position Sizing Avoid risking more than 1-2% of your trading account on a single trade. 3. Diversify Your Trades Don’t rely solely on gold; diversify across different assets to mitigate risk. 4. Monitor Leverage While leverage can amplify profits, it also increases risk. Use leverage cautiously when trading gold. Best Times to Trade Gold in Forex Gold trading is most active during overlapping market hours, particularly: New York Session (1:00 PM – 10:00 PM GMT): High liquidity due to the U.S. market. London Session (8:00 AM – 5:00 PM GMT): European traders contribute to market activity. Common Mistakes to Avoid in Gold Trading 1. Ignoring Risk Management Failing to set stop-loss orders or over-leveraging can lead to significant losses. 2. Overtrading Avoid excessive trading based on emotional decisions or short-term price movements. 3. Neglecting News Events Economic reports and geopolitical developments can drastically affect gold prices. 4. Trading Without a Plan Always have a clear strategy and stick to it. Conclusion: Mastering Gold Trading in Forex Trading gold in the forex market offers immense opportunities for both novice and experienced traders. By understanding the factors influencing gold prices, employing effective trading strategies, and managing risks prudently, you can enhance your trading success. Whether you’re looking to hedge against market volatility or diversify your portfolio, gold remains a reliable and dynamic asset in the forex trading world. Ready to trade gold in forex?

Analysts Say This Level Is Key,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/is-bitcoin-ending-2024-on-a-high-note-analysts-say-this-level-is-key/,"As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to move sideways, investors wonder whether the flagship crypto will end the year positively or on a sour note. Some analysts suggest a close above recently lost levels could propel BTC’s price to new highs. Related Reading: Analyst Forecast ‘Highly Bullish’ 2025 For Ethereum: Is The Bleeding Over? Bitcoin’s Red Week, Green Year Since breaking past the long-awaited $100,000 barrier in early December, Bitcoin has seen two significant corrections to the lower zone of its one-month range. Throughout the month, the flagship crypto’s price has traded between $90,000 and $108,000, hovering between $96,000 and $102,000 for most of December. However, since reaching its latest all-time high (ATH) of $108,353 ten days ago, Bitcoin has lost the $100,000 support zone, falling to its lowest price in weeks. Over the past week, BTC has struggled to reclaim the $98,000 support zone, losing its Christmas retest above this level on Thursday. Now, the largest crypto by market capitalization moves within the mid-zone of its monthly range, displaying a candle that “doesn’t look great but also not the worst. Neutral, and still a few more days to go,” as Altcoin Sherpa stated. The analyst suggested that Bitcoin could see “some weird price action over the next few weeks with despair followed by an absolute moon mission and killer alt season.” Meanwhile, Daan Crypto Trades called BTC’s current price action the “end of the year chop.” He noted that as Bitcoin moves sideways, liquidity is “building on both sides,” with an area of interest below $94,000 and a key level above the $100,000 mark. Some investors asked the community to zoom out on BTC’s chart, highlighting that the cryptocurrency remains within a historical range despite the horizontal trajectory. If Bitcoin were to end the year at its current price, it would still record a 48.15% return in Q4 and a 122% increase in the yearly timeframe. Bitcoin Risks Fall To One-Month Lows Analyst Carl Runefelt considers that investors should watch the $92,500 support zone, as breaking below that horizontal level could send BTC’s price to $86,000. Similarly, Ali Martinez warned investors about a key level for BTC. Martinez asserted that investors “don’t want Bitcoin to dip below $92,730,” explaining that it is “essentially free fall territory” if the flagship crypto loses that level. According to the analyst, the flagship crypto could fall as low as $70,000 if it loses the key support zone based on the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) chart. In a previous post, he explored a bearish outlook where BTC could fall as low as $60,000, noting that several experts forecasted a correction anywhere from 23% to 36% for BTC. Martinez considers a 25% crash to the $70,000 mark possible, as the URPD chart shows minimal support below the $93,806 and $92,730 zones. “If this critical demand area doesn’t hold, we could see a sharp drop to $70,085,” he warned.

PENGU Flips BONK Amid Whale Accumulation He also pointed out that Bitcoin broke below one of its “most significant support zones at $97,300,” which suggests a bearish outlook while it isn’t reclaimed. However, the analyst asserted that this outlook would be invalidated if BTC has “a sustained close above $97,300 and, more critically, a daily close above $100,000.” Martinez added that reclaiming these levels could start the next leg toward the $168,000 target. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $94,587, a 1.24% decrease in the daily timeframe.

It’s surprising, as the token has been under a major downtrend and consolidation for years. Interestingly, the token is up when the crypto market is falling, gaining every investor’s attention. So, let’s discuss why the FSL ecosystem’s native token is pumping out of the blue. GMT Price Booming With Increased Trading Volume & OI STEPN GMT’s price began rising around a month ago, but it fell short and declined again with the crypto market’s downtrend. After that, it hit the month’s bottom at $0.129 before starting a recovery three days ago. This happened because investors’ trading activity increased its demand. This becomes clearer when the 24-hour trading volume hits $1.92B after a 228.37% surge. Additionally, the Coinglass reports reveal a 63% increase in Open Interest. As a result, the GMT token’s price has surged 40% over the last 24 hours. More importantly, it’s up by 60% over the week, pushing its market capitalization to $621.89M. Interestingly, there is no significant reason behind this increased investor interest, but there was a spike in short liquidations in December. Although this suggests that traders are betting against the current surge, they got liquidated with the GMT price rally. Eventually, the shorts began rebuying the assets and accelerating the STEPN token price. However, in contrast, the crypto exchange has witnessed an increased inflow of the GMT token. If this inflow or dumping continues, it could eventually affect the GMT price. Additionally, a possible Bitcoin price crash to $60k could influence the entire crypto market’s performance, including GMT. Will GMT’s Price Rally Sustain? After a 60% rally over the week, the GMT chart is forming an inverse head and shoulders pattern, which is a sign of a potential bullish reversal. Additionally, the RSI is bullish, adding to the previous outlook, but it’s near the overbuying zone, which could change things in the long term. However, the Awesome Oscillator is flipping bullish as it attempts to flip above the zero mean level. With that, a breakout above $0.248 could push the STEPN GMT token to $0.4155. However, the price could drop to $0.161 before this breakout, but any move down to $0.161 could disturb the bullish momentum. Careful consideration and strategic trades need to be placed between these zones. What Investor’s Should Do? The FSL ecosystem’s token hit its prime around three and half years ago when it achieved the ATH of $4.11. However, with years of struggle, the target has moved 95% away from that, putting the long holder in a major loss. However, the current situation has opened the opportunity for immediate gains, as the GMT price is constantly moving upwards. As a result, the investors are also getting ready for sale with the inflows rising on the crypto exchanges . Clear strategic planning and careful trades are needed to earn profits, as the STEPN GMT token’s chart forms an inverse head and shoulders pattern. This could push the price to $0.4155 and higher if things went well.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) bullish momentum may be at risk as market analysts observe a resurgence in Tether (USDT) dominance , raising concerns about a potential crash. According to TradingView contributor Forex Mindset , this trend could lead Bitcoin to test crucial support levels around $81,500 , fueled by bearish momentum and overbought RSI indicators. Understanding USDT Dominance and Its Implications USDT dominance refers to the percentage share of Tether, a popular stablecoin, in the overall cryptocurrency market. A rising USDT dominance often indicates: Increased Demand for Stability: Investors may be moving funds into USDT to hedge against potential market volatility. Weakened Buying Pressure: A shift away from BTC and other volatile assets toward stablecoins could signal waning confidence in the market’s short-term upside. Forex Mindset suggests that the recovery in USDT dominance aligns with historical patterns that precede Bitcoin price corrections. Key Factors Contributing to Bearish Bitcoin Outlook 1. Overbought RSI Signals The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for Bitcoin shows overbought conditions, hinting at a possible trend reversal. Historically, overbought RSI levels have been precursors to significant price pullbacks. 2. Weak Support at $81,500 Analysts identify $81,500 as a critical support level for BTC. A breach of this level could lead to accelerated selling pressure, dragging Bitcoin prices lower. 3. Macroeconomic Concerns Uncertainty surrounding Federal Reserve monetary policies continues to weigh on investor sentiment. Rising interest rates and tighter financial conditions could further dampen appetite for riskier assets like Bitcoin. Historical Context: USDT Dominance vs. Bitcoin Price Previous instances of rising USDT dominance have coincided with notable Bitcoin price declines: May 2021: USDT dominance spiked during Bitcoin’s crash from $64,000 to $30,000 . November 2022: A similar pattern emerged as Bitcoin plummeted to $15,500 amid market-wide turmoil following the FTX collapse. If history repeats itself, the current rise in USDT dominance could foreshadow another downturn for Bitcoin. Is the Bitcoin Bull Run Over? Despite bearish signals, many market participants remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term prospects: 1. Institutional Interest Remains Strong Large institutions continue to accumulate Bitcoin, with significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs and custody services. Increased adoption by financial giants like BlackRock and Fidelity provides a strong foundation for BTC’s future growth. 2. Upcoming Halving Event Bitcoin’s next halving , scheduled for mid-2025, is expected to reduce supply and potentially drive prices higher. Historically, halving events have been followed by significant bull runs. 3. Expanding Use Cases Bitcoin is gaining traction as a hedge against inflation and a store of value, attracting both retail and institutional investors. Strategies for Investors Amid Volatility For those navigating the current market uncertainty, here are some strategies to consider: 1. Diversify Holdings Balance exposure to volatile assets like Bitcoin with stablecoins or other less risky investments. 2. Monitor Key Support Levels Keep an eye on $81,500 and other significant support zones. Use stop-loss orders to protect against sudden downturns. 3. Stay Updated on Market Trends Follow indicators like USDT dominance, RSI levels, and macroeconomic developments to anticipate potential market movements. Conclusion The recovery in USDT dominance raises concerns about a potential Bitcoin price correction, with analysts pointing to $81,500 as a crucial support level. While short-term risks loom, Bitcoin’s long-term fundamentals remain robust, driven by institutional adoption and upcoming milestones like the halving event. Investors should tread cautiously, stay informed, and consider diversifying their portfolios to navigate potential volatility in the weeks ahead.

The billionaire CEO of Tesla has been in a long-standing battle with OpenAI, accusing the firm of going against its promises to investors. The SpaceX boss filed an injunction asking the court to block OpenAI’s transition into a for-profit organization. The brief was submitted by Encode’s legal counsel at the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. In the brief, the organization asserts that granting OpenAI’s for-profit status will undermine the company’s vision. This means that its technologies will no longer be developed and deployed in a way that will be safe and beneficial to the public. Encode joins the fight against OpenAI’s transition In its brief , Encode mentioned that OpenAI’s vision statement needs to be taken seriously. “OpenAI and its CEO, Sam Altman, claim to be developing society-transforming technology, and those claims should be taken seriously,” the brief read. The brief also said that it is in the best interest of the general public to have a public charity control the firm’s actions. Encode believes that if the public charity controls OpenAI’s actions, it can prioritize public benefits and not just focus on generating returns for its privileged investors. Another portion of the brief mentioned that the move should be blocked because the general public already has vested interests in the technology. Encode’s lawyers also ripped into OpenAI’s move to cede control to a PBC. “The move would convert an organization bound by law to ensure the safety of advanced AI into one bound by law to ‘balance’ its consideration of any public benefit against ‘the pecuniary interests of [its] stockholders,” it said. The legal counsels noted in the brief, the company’s ethos of not competing with safety-conscious projects that are close to building AGI before it does. Meanwhile, if it moves to a for-profit organization, it would have to discard such initiatives. It also said that if the time comes for the non-profit arm to push for safety by returning investor’s equity, it would be blocked from doing so after the restructuring. Encode’s brief also said that the firm’s humanity-first responsibility to the public would evaporate if the move is approved. It claims the safety-focused approach would be breached, a move that could harm public interest. The non-profit arm could also be forced to relinquish control at any point in time with no commitment made towards public safety. OpenAI’s new model and its legal battle with Elon Musk OpenAI was initially founded as a non-profit organization in 2015, with the company just a research lab. Along the line, it needed capital to carry out some of its projects, paving the way for its current structure. The company has raised funds from several venture capitalists and corporations, including its biggest investor to date, Microsoft. Presently, the company has a hybrid structure, a profit arm that is controlled by its non-profit arm which provides a capped profit for investors and employees. The company has also hinted in a blog about its intention to transition its for-profit arm into a Delaware Public Benefit Corporation (PBC). With this, its non-profit arm will continue to exist but will surrender control of shares at the PBC. Elon Musk, one of the co-founders and an early contributor filed a lawsuit requesting the court to block the transition. Musk accused the firm of abandoning its original vision, denying the public from having access to its research. OpenAI hit back at Musk, calling his accusations baseless. The firm claimed he was the first to suggest the move to a for-profit model. Encode is not the first organization to back Elon Musk and oppose OpenAI’s transition. Meta Platforms sent a letter to California general attorney Rob Bonta arguing against the shift. According to the Facebook parent company and fellow rival in the AI scene, the move will have a shattering effect on Silicon Valley. The company also registered its faith in fellow rival Elon Musk to lead the case and represent the general public.

The Nasdaq Composite led the decline, dropping 2.10% , while the S&P 500 fell 1.53% , and the Dow Jones Industrial Average decreased by 1.13% . The downturn reflects growing investor concerns over macroeconomic uncertainty and market volatility. What Caused the Market Decline? 1. Concerns Over Interest Rate Policy Persistent fears about the Federal Reserve’s monetary tightening measures contributed to market unease. Investors are weighing the possibility of further rate hikes to combat inflation, which could dampen economic growth. 2. Economic Data Misses Expectations Recent economic reports indicate slower-than-expected consumer spending during the holiday season. Weaker retail performance has added to concerns about the health of the U.S. economy. 3. Tech Sector Under Pressure The tech-heavy Nasdaq suffered the steepest losses, with major companies such as Tesla , Apple , and Nvidia facing sharp declines. Rising interest rates disproportionately affect tech firms, which rely on growth-driven valuations. Sector Performance Highlights 1. Technology Tesla dropped 3.5% , while Apple fell 2.8% , leading losses in the tech sector. Chipmakers such as AMD and Nvidia also experienced declines amid concerns about reduced demand in 2025. 2. Financials Financial stocks remained relatively stable but faced minor losses as interest rate concerns persisted. JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America reported declines of 0.9% and 0.8% , respectively. 3. Consumer Discretionary Retail stocks like Target and Amazon struggled as holiday sales data revealed lackluster performance. Amazon fell 2.2% , reflecting broader concerns about consumer spending. Market Sentiment: What Are Analysts Saying? 1. Volatility to Persist Analysts expect heightened market volatility in the coming weeks as investors process economic data and corporate earnings reports. “This pullback is likely a response to mixed signals from economic indicators,” said a senior analyst at Morgan Stanley. 2. Buying Opportunities Amidst the Decline Some strategists view the downturn as a chance to accumulate quality stocks at lower prices. “Long-term investors should focus on sectors like healthcare and energy, which may offer resilience in a slowing economy,” noted an equity strategist. Global Market Impacts 1. Asian and European Markets The losses in U.S. markets followed a similarly weak performance in Asian and European markets earlier in the day. Japan’s Nikkei 225 and Germany’s DAX closed down 1.7% and 1.3% , respectively. 2. Impact on Cryptocurrencies The decline in equity markets mirrored the performance of major cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin and Ethereum down 2% and 1.5% , respectively. How Should Investors Respond? 1. Diversification is Key Investors should ensure their portfolios are diversified across various sectors and asset classes to mitigate risks during volatile periods. 2. Monitor Key Economic Data Keep an eye on upcoming economic reports, including the Federal Reserve’s next meeting and corporate earnings announcements. 3. Stay Focused on Long-Term Goals While market pullbacks can be unsettling, they often present buying opportunities for long-term investors. Conclusion The U.S. markets experienced significant intraday losses on December 27, with the Nasdaq Composite, S&P 500, and Dow Jones all declining amid growing economic uncertainty and pressure on the technology sector. As investors navigate this challenging environment, staying informed and maintaining a long-term perspective will be crucial.

Fidelity’s FBTC led the exodus, with outflows amounting to $208.2 million , followed by ARK Invest’s ARKB with $112.59 million , Bitwise’s BITB with $35.98 million , and Invesco’s BTCO with $14.15 million . Interestingly, while several ETFs faced outflows, BlackRock’s IBIT and Grayscale’s GBTC bucked the trend, registering net inflows of $79.4 million and $3.75 million , respectively. Key ETF Performances on December 27 1. Fidelity’s FBTC Leads Outflows Net Outflow: $208.2 million Fidelity’s FBTC accounted for the bulk of the day’s ETF outflows, signaling cautious sentiment among institutional investors. 2. ARK Invest’s ARKB Net Outflow: $112.59 million ARK Invest’s Bitcoin ETF also recorded substantial outflows, reflecting reduced exposure among its investor base. 3. Bitwise’s BITB and Invesco’s BTCO Net Outflows: $35.98 million and $14.15 million, respectively. Both ETFs followed the broader trend of net outflows, though their figures were smaller compared to FBTC and ARKB. 4. BlackRock’s IBIT and Grayscale’s GBTC See Net Inflows Net Inflows: $79.4 million (IBIT) and $3.75 million (GBTC). BlackRock’s IBIT showed resilience, attracting significant inflows as it continues to solidify its position in the Bitcoin ETF space. Grayscale’s GBTC also reported modest positive inflows, hinting at targeted interest from long-term investors. What Do These Movements Indicate? The ETF net outflows reflect mixed sentiment among investors amid broader cryptocurrency market uncertainty. Here are the likely factors influencing the flows: 1. Market Volatility and Profit-Taking Bitcoin’s recent price fluctuations have led many investors to lock in profits. ETF outflows often correlate with market corrections, as traders shift assets to stablecoins or cash for risk management. 2. Institutional Caution The significant outflows from major ETFs like FBTC and ARKB may signal caution from large-scale investors amid uncertain market conditions. 3. Differing Sentiments Across ETFs The inflows into BlackRock’s IBIT suggest confidence in BlackRock’s management and reputation, even as other ETFs struggled to retain investor funds. Grayscale’s GBTC inflows indicate continued interest from traditional investors familiar with the Grayscale brand. Broader Implications for Bitcoin ETFs 1. Mixed Investor Sentiment While outflows dominate the narrative, the inflows into IBIT and GBTC highlight contrasting investor strategies. 2. Regulatory and Macro Factors Regulatory developments surrounding Bitcoin and broader economic conditions play a critical role in influencing ETF inflows and outflows. Investors are closely watching for any updates from the SEC and Federal Reserve policies that might affect Bitcoin’s trajectory. 3. Long-Term Growth Potential Despite short-term outflows, the growing adoption of Bitcoin ETFs and the increasing participation of institutional players underline the asset’s long-term potential. Investor Takeaways 1. Monitor Bitcoin’s Price Levels The outflows may indicate near-term bearish sentiment, especially if Bitcoin struggles to maintain key support levels. 2. Focus on Fund Stability ETFs like BlackRock’s IBIT that attract inflows even during periods of market uncertainty can signal stronger investor confidence. 3. Diversify Across Asset Classes Investors should consider balancing their cryptocurrency exposure with other asset classes to mitigate risks associated with market volatility. Conclusion The net outflow of $287.77 million from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on December 27 highlights a period of caution among investors, with Fidelity’s FBTC and ARK Invest’s ARKB leading the withdrawals. However, inflows into BlackRock’s IBIT and Grayscale’s GBTC reflect continued faith in select products, even amid market turbulence.

According to insights compiled by BeInCrypto , 2025 promises to be a transformative year for blockchain and digital assets. From advancements in AI-powered agents to the adoption of stablecoins in emerging markets, here’s what nine crypto executives believe will shape the cryptocurrency market in the coming year. Key Trends Shaping the Cryptocurrency Market in 2025 1. AI Agents Revolutionizing Blockchain Tasks The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in blockchain systems is set to redefine the industry. What Are AI Agents?

Recent Examples: Projects like BlackRock’s tokenized treasury funds exemplify the growing institutional interest in RWAs. Benefits: Increased liquidity for traditionally illiquid assets. Greater accessibility for retail and institutional investors. Enhanced stability within volatile cryptocurrency markets. 3. Bitcoin Reserves as a Financial Tool Governments and municipalities are exploring Bitcoin reserves to enhance financial resilience. Case Studies: Bhutan and Vancouver are actively investigating Bitcoin reserves to support their economies. U.S. initiatives hint at broader adoption of Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Why Now? The increasing recognition of Bitcoin’s utility as a store of value makes it an attractive option for both sovereign nations and local governments. 4. A Friendlier Regulatory Landscape Crypto executives foresee significant improvements in the regulatory environment. Key Drivers: A potential leadership shift at the U.S. SEC , which could lead to more accommodating policies. Regulatory advancements in regions like the Asia-Pacific and European Union . Impact on the Market: Favorable regulations can boost institutional confidence, reduce compliance barriers, and foster innovation. 5. Stablecoin Adoption in Emerging Markets Stablecoins are becoming essential tools for daily transactions in regions grappling with economic instability. Hotspots: Adoption is surging in Latin America (LATAM) and Africa due to currency volatility and inflation. Applications: Everyday transactions for goods and services. Protection of savings against local currency depreciation. Broader Blockchain Adoption Trends 1. Institutional Interest Booming Institutions are increasingly exploring blockchain solutions for use cases ranging from supply chain management to cross-border payments. Tokenization of assets and blockchain-based finance could see a significant boost in 2025. 2. DeFi Evolution Decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms are expected to become more user-friendly, integrating AI and real-world assets to cater to both retail and institutional investors. 3. NFTs Making a Comeback Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are anticipated to regain momentum, fueled by innovative use cases in gaming, metaverse platforms, and digital collectibles. Challenges to Overcome While the outlook for 2025 is optimistic, several hurdles remain: Regulatory Uncertainty in Key Markets Progress in the U.S. and EU could be slowed by political changes or unforeseen challenges. Scalability Issues With rising adoption, blockchain networks must scale efficiently to handle increased transaction volumes. Cybersecurity Risks The growth of blockchain technology also invites more sophisticated hacking attempts. How Investors Can Prepare for 2025 1. Diversify Across Emerging Trends Invest in areas poised for growth, such as RWAs , AI-integrated platforms , and DeFi protocols . 2. Monitor Regulatory Developments Stay informed about changing laws and policies in key markets like the U.S., EU, and Asia-Pacific. 3. Leverage Stablecoins For investors in emerging markets, stablecoins offer a reliable hedge against local currency risks. 4. Stay Updated on Institutional Moves Watch for announcements from major corporations and financial institutions regarding blockchain initiatives and cryptocurrency holdings. Conclusion The predictions from crypto executives paint an exciting picture for 2025, with advancements in AI, tokenization, and stablecoins driving the market forward. While challenges remain, the growing integration of blockchain technology into mainstream financial and business systems signals a bright future for the industry. Investors and enthusiasts alike should watch these trends closely, as they could offer both opportunities and insights into the evolving cryptocurrency landscape.

Ethereum (ETH), the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is poised for significant growth over the next year, according to a new report from Galaxy Research . The firm predicts that Ether will surpass a price of $5,500 in 2025, citing favorable conditions for the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, growing blockchain adoption, and a resurgence in the NFT market as key catalysts for this growth. Key Drivers Behind ETH’s Projected Growth 1. Improved DeFi Regulatory Environment Galaxy Research highlights the potential for regulatory clarity to bolster the DeFi sector. As governments implement regulatory sandboxes , DeFi platforms may see increased adoption from institutional investors. Regulatory certainty could attract significant capital, fostering innovation and expansion within Ethereum’s ecosystem. 2. Blockchain Testing in Capital Markets The report anticipates that traditional financial institutions will test public blockchains for capital market applications . Ethereum, with its smart contract capabilities and widespread adoption, is well-positioned to be a preferred platform. Successful implementation of blockchain solutions in regulated environments could drive institutional demand for ETH. 3. NFT Market Resurgence Non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which fueled a major crypto bull market in 2021, are expected to recover in 2025. Ethereum remains the dominant blockchain for NFTs, with projects like OpenSea and Blur driving significant activity. The re-emergence of high-value NFT projects could further increase transaction volume and demand for ETH. Ethereum’s Role in the Broader Crypto Ecosystem 1. The Backbone of DeFi Ethereum powers the majority of DeFi applications, including lending, borrowing, and decentralized exchanges. Its role as the foundational layer of DeFi ensures its continued relevance, especially with the sector’s projected growth. 2. Transition to Ethereum 2.0 The Ethereum network has undergone a significant transformation, transitioning to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. This shift has reduced energy consumption and increased scalability, making Ethereum more attractive to developers and investors. 3. Layer-2 Solutions The proliferation of Layer-2 scaling solutions like Arbitrum , Optimism , and Polygon has eased network congestion and reduced gas fees. These advancements have enhanced Ethereum’s usability, encouraging more adoption across various sectors. What Does This Mean for Investors? 1. Long-Term Growth Opportunity A price target of $5,500 represents significant upside potential for Ethereum, which is currently trading around $1,800-$2,000 . Long-term holders can benefit from Ethereum’s expanding ecosystem and increasing institutional interest. 2. Diversification Through DeFi and NFTs Investors can explore opportunities within Ethereum-based DeFi platforms and NFT projects. Exposure to these sectors can provide diversified returns while leveraging Ethereum’s growth. 3. Staking Rewards The move to PoS has introduced staking as a means to earn passive income. Staking ETH can provide consistent returns while supporting the network’s security. Challenges to Consider While the outlook for Ethereum is positive, certain challenges could impact its growth trajectory: 1. Regulatory Risks Unfavorable regulations, particularly in major markets like the U.S. and EU, could dampen investor confidence. 2. Competition from Other Blockchains Rivals like Solana , Avalanche , and Binance Smart Chain are aggressively targeting Ethereum’s market share with faster and cheaper solutions. 3. Network Upgrades Delays or complications in implementing future upgrades could hinder Ethereum’s scalability and adoption. Expert Insights 1. Galaxy Research’s Perspective Galaxy Research sees Ethereum as a linchpin for the evolving crypto ecosystem. With its robust infrastructure and unmatched developer activity, Ethereum remains a clear leader in the blockchain space. 2. Broader Industry Sentiment Mike Novogratz , CEO of Galaxy Digital, recently emphasized Ethereum’s potential to dominate not just in DeFi but also in traditional finance. Other analysts predict a multi-trillion-dollar market cap for Ethereum by 2030, driven by its utility across industries. Conclusion The prediction that Ethereum could surpass $5,500 in 2025 underscores the blockchain’s growing influence in the digital economy. From DeFi innovation to a revitalized NFT market , Ethereum is poised to capitalize on multiple growth avenues. Investors should keep a close eye on regulatory developments, technological advancements, and emerging competitors while positioning themselves to benefit from Ethereum’s long-term potential.

Despite short-term bearish risks, long-term forecasts project significant growth, with price targets of $200,000 by 2025 and $740,000 by 2028 , according to BeInCrypto . The world’s largest cryptocurrency has faced headwinds in recent weeks, with investors moving $3 billion worth of Bitcoin to exchanges and ETF outflows exceeding $1 billion . These indicators suggest heightened caution and the potential for further corrections. Short-Term Outlook: Why Bitcoin May Drop to $60K 1. Stalling Momentum Bitcoin’s recent inability to sustain higher price levels indicates a pause in its upward trajectory. Analysts attribute this to a lack of new buyers entering the market, coupled with profit-taking by early investors. 2. Weakening Support Levels The $70,000 support level has shown signs of fragility, leaving the door open for further declines to $60,000 . A drop below this threshold could trigger additional sell-offs, intensifying bearish sentiment. 3. Rising Exchange Inflows Investors moved $3 billion worth of Bitcoin to exchanges, a move often associated with selling pressure. Such large-scale transfers indicate a cautious market sentiment, as traders prepare for potential volatility. ETF Outflows Signal Investor Caution The cryptocurrency market has also witnessed significant ETF outflows , totaling more than $1 billion. These outflows highlight a shift in sentiment among institutional investors, who may be adopting a wait-and-see approach amid current market conditions. ETF trends often mirror broader market sentiment, making this an important metric for assessing near-term risks. Long-Term Predictions Remain Optimistic Despite short-term uncertainties, analysts maintain a positive outlook for Bitcoin’s long-term growth. 1. Price Targets $200,000 by 2025 : Analysts believe Bitcoin will benefit from increasing adoption, technological advancements, and the upcoming 2024 halving event. $740,000 by 2028 : The growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a store of value and its integration into financial systems are expected to drive substantial price appreciation. 2. Institutional Adoption Major corporations and financial institutions continue to accumulate Bitcoin, signaling confidence in its long-term potential. Regulatory clarity in key markets could further accelerate institutional participation. 3. Global Macro Trends Bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge against inflation and economic instability remains a key driver for its adoption. With central banks around the world exploring digital currencies, Bitcoin’s role as the leading decentralized asset is expected to strengthen. What Does This Mean for Investors? 1. Short-Term Caution Investors should prepare for potential volatility, particularly if Bitcoin dips below $60,000 . Stop-loss orders and risk management strategies are crucial during periods of uncertainty. 2. Long-Term Opportunity The current dip may present a buying opportunity for those with a long-term investment horizon. Accumulating Bitcoin during corrections has historically proven to be a profitable strategy. Key Indicators to Watch 1. Exchange Activity Monitor exchange inflow and outflow volumes, which provide insights into market sentiment and potential selling pressure. 2. ETF Trends ETF inflows or outflows can signal shifts in institutional sentiment, impacting Bitcoin’s price trajectory. 3. Support and Resistance Levels Keep an eye on critical price levels, such as $70,000 (support) and $60,000 (potential target). Conclusion While Bitcoin faces short-term risks, including a potential dip to $60,000 , its long-term growth prospects remain strong. Analysts project significant gains, driven by increased adoption, institutional investment, and macroeconomic trends. For investors, maintaining a balanced perspective and leveraging market corrections as buying opportunities can pave the way for future gains. As the cryptocurrency market evolves, staying informed about key developments will be essential for navigating both short-term challenges and long-term opportunities.

38222815,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=115339,1735382656,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crypto Fear & Greed Index Drops to 72: Market Sentiment Remains in the ‘Greed’ Zone,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-fear-greed-index-drops-to-72-2/,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index Drops to 72: Market Sentiment Remains in the ‘Greed’ Zone The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a widely-used sentiment indicator for the cryptocurrency market, registered a score of 72 on Dec. 28. While this marks a two-point decline from the previous day, the index remains firmly in the “Greed” zone , signifying overall optimism among market participants. This metric, developed by Alternative , gauges market sentiment on a scale from 0 to 100 , where 0 represents extreme fear and 100 denotes extreme greed. With its current position, the index highlights a market driven by confidence, though the slight dip suggests a mild cooling of sentiment. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a sentiment analysis tool designed to measure the emotional dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. It aggregates data from six core factors: 1. Volatility (25%) Measures the degree of price fluctuations in the market. High volatility often correlates with increased fear. 2. Market Momentum/Volume (25%) Tracks the trading volume and momentum of major cryptocurrencies. High momentum typically reflects bullish sentiment. 3. Social Media (15%) Monitors mentions, trends, and activity on platforms like Twitter. Positive buzz amplifies the “Greed” reading. 4. Surveys (15%) Based on community polls about market sentiment. Offers insight into the perception of retail investors. 5. Bitcoin Dominance (10%) Reflects Bitcoin’s share of the overall cryptocurrency market cap. A declining dominance suggests increasing interest in altcoins. 6. Google Trends (10%) Analyzes search interest in Bitcoin-related terms. Spikes in search volume can indicate heightened attention. What Does a Score of 72 Indicate? 1. Sustained Optimism The “Greed” zone (scores between 55–75) reflects an optimistic market outlook. Investors are confident, potentially taking on more risk to capitalize on bullish trends. 2. Cooling Enthusiasm The slight dip from 74 to 72 suggests a tempered sentiment compared to previous days. External factors, such as market corrections or regulatory news, could influence this shift. Current Market Factors Influencing the Index 1. Bitcoin Price Consolidation Bitcoin has been trading within a relatively narrow range, fostering market stability. Stable prices reduce fear, encouraging greater participation in the market. 2. Seasonal Market Trends Year-end activities, including portfolio rebalancing, often impact market sentiment. The crypto market has historically seen increased activity during the holiday season. 3. Increased Altcoin Activity Rising interest in altcoins, as evidenced by gains in trading volume for projects like Ethereum and Solana , boosts market momentum. Risks of High “Greed” Levels While a high score in the “Greed” zone can signify bullish sentiment, it also presents potential risks: 1. Overbought Conditions A persistent “Greed” reading often coincides with overbought market conditions. This increases the likelihood of corrections as investors take profits. 2. Emotional Decision-Making High levels of greed can lead to irrational investment decisions, such as chasing pumps or over-leveraging positions. Potential Implications for the Market 1. Increased Retail Participation Positive sentiment can attract more retail investors, driving up trading volumes. The fear of missing out (FOMO) often amplifies during “Greed” phases. 2. Altcoin Market Expansion As Bitcoin stabilizes, funds may flow into altcoins, leading to increased activity in projects with strong fundamentals. 3. Heightened Volatility Risk A sentiment shift from greed to fear can trigger sharp market corrections, emphasizing the need for cautious trading strategies. How to Navigate the Current Market For Bitcoin Investors Monitor key support and resistance levels. Consider partial profit-taking if Bitcoin shows signs of overextension. For Altcoin Traders Focus on projects with high trading volumes and significant use cases. Stay vigilant about potential market corrections triggered by profit-taking in Bitcoin. For Long-Term Holders Stick to your strategy and avoid reacting emotionally to short-term sentiment changes. Use dips in the “Greed” zone as buying opportunities if fundamentals remain strong. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s score of 72 highlights sustained optimism in the cryptocurrency market, with a slight dip signaling tempered enthusiasm. As the market remains in the “Greed” zone, traders and investors should balance their strategies, recognizing the potential for both continued growth and heightened volatility. Keeping an eye on sentiment metrics like the Fear & Greed Index can help market participants make more informed decisions, navigating the fine line between confidence and caution.

Usage: Traders look for strong momentum and enter trades in the direction of the breakout. 4. Trend Following Strategy In this strategy, traders align their trades with the prevailing market trend. Tools: Trendlines, moving averages, and price swings. 5. Reversal Strategy Reversal strategies involve identifying when a trend is likely to change direction. Indicators: Double tops/bottoms, head and shoulders patterns.

Instead, policymakers may leverage the country’s existing Bitcoin stockpile as part of a potential Bitcoin reserve policy , according to a Cointelegraph report . Current U.S. Bitcoin Holdings The U.S. government holds approximately 183,850 BTC , valued at $17.36 billion as of today. These holdings primarily stem from: Seizures of illicit funds , such as the Silk Road case. Auctioning of confiscated Bitcoin , which contributed to its reserve. Proposed Bitcoin Reserve Policy 1. The Bitcoin Act 2024 Senator Cynthia Lummis has introduced the Bitcoin Act 2024 , which proposes: Accumulating 1 million BTC over five years. Purchasing 200,000 BTC annually , creating a substantial Bitcoin reserve. 2. Strategic Importance of Bitcoin Reserves Advocates argue that a national Bitcoin reserve could: Diversify the country’s financial assets. Act as a hedge against inflation. Strengthen U.S. leadership in global digital asset markets. Why the U.S. Might Not Buy Bitcoin in 2025 1. Leverage Existing Holdings Galaxy Digital suggests the government may rely on its current Bitcoin stockpile, strategically utilizing it rather than expanding it through new purchases. 2. Policy Deliberations Ongoing debates about Bitcoin’s role in national reserves might delay significant action. Skepticism among policymakers regarding Bitcoin’s volatility and regulatory implications. 3. Alternative Approaches Instead of purchasing, the government could explore using Bitcoin for: Backing a digital dollar. Supporting financial aid programs or blockchain initiatives. Potential Impacts of the Bitcoin Act 2024 1. Market Influence If the U.S. commits to buying 200,000 BTC annually , it could: Drive demand and increase Bitcoin prices. Set a global precedent, encouraging other nations to follow suit. 2. Industry Growth A formal Bitcoin reserve policy could catalyze: Increased institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. Development of blockchain infrastructure within the U.S. 3. Regulatory Considerations Policymakers would need to address: Tax implications of Bitcoin holdings. Security measures to protect the national reserve. What This Means for the Crypto Market 1. Government Influence The U.S. government’s stance on Bitcoin as a strategic asset will significantly influence global market dynamics. Speculation about a reserve policy could create price volatility in the short term. 2. Institutional Adoption A clear policy framework could encourage private institutions to increase their Bitcoin holdings, further mainstreaming digital assets. 3. Geopolitical Implications A national Bitcoin reserve would strengthen the U.S.’s position in the global digital economy , especially as other countries explore central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Conclusion While Galaxy Digital predicts that the U.S. government will refrain from purchasing more Bitcoin in 2025, the possibility of implementing a Bitcoin reserve policy highlights the increasing relevance of digital assets in national economic strategies. Whether through leveraging existing holdings or adopting a formal accumulation plan, the U.S. is poised to play a critical role in shaping the future of cryptocurrency.

Lightchain AI (LCAI) is capturing attention with its groundbreaking innovations like Proof of Intelligence (PoI) and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), seamlessly integrating AI with blockchain for unprecedented scalability and efficiency. Currently in its presale at just $0.003 per token, LCAI offers investors a unique opportunity to get in early on a project poised for transformative growth in decentralized technology and AI. The Next Big Altcoin Opportunity- What Sets It Apart From SOL and XRP The digital money market always looks for the next big altcoin, and this new player is different with special value ideas that go beyond Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP). Different from SOL which pays much attention to speed and size, and XRP which is about payments across borders, this altcoin brings a new way to use it that has no equal value in its system. Its strong token rules, new tech, and promise to fix real-life issues give it an edge. The mix of top AI tools and eco-friendly blockchain fixes draws in both regular folks and big investors. With a fast-growing group of users and smart deals boosting its use, this altcoin is ready for quick growth catching the eye of investors looking for big chances i͏n the blockchain area. $630 to $63,000- The 100-Day Growth Potential Explained The potential for $630 to grow into $63,000 within 100 days hinges on the exponential trajectory of a high-performing altcoin with solid fundamentals and market demand. This altcoin’s unique ecosystem positions it as a disruptor, targeting real-world challenges with scalable solutions. Its deflationary tokenomics, reduced supply over time, and innovative reward systems incentivize early adopters while driving value. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, its adoption is rapidly growing due to its seamless integration with trending technologies like AI and blockchain interoperability. Market catalysts such as strategic partnerships, a growing user base, and bullish sentiment in the altcoin sector amplify this growth potential. With its market cap still at an early stage, the possibility of rapid price appreciation is significant. Investors betting $630 today could see life-changing returns as the crypto market anticipates an explosive rally over the coming months. How Lightchain AI (LCAI) Will Convert $630 to $63,00 Investing $630 in Lightchain AI (LCAI) during its presale phase, where tokens are priced at $0.003, would yield 210,000 tokens. Analysts project that LCAI could reach $50 per token, which would value your investment at $10,500,000. This growth potential is attributed to LCAI’s innovative integration of artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, featuring unique elements like the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM). These advancements position LCAI to address real-world challenges across various industries, enhancing its adoption and value. However, it’s important to recognize that such projections are speculative and depend on various factors, including market demand, technological advancements, and successful execution of the project’s roadmap. Investors should conduct thorough research and consider the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrency investments before committing funds. Why $LCAI Could Be the Biggest Opportunity of 2024/2025 Whenever a token starts gaining attention as a potential 100x or even 500x investment, the first question is almost always the same: Why should I trust this project? Here’s why Lightchain AI is different. 1. An Innovative Consensus Mechanism (PoI) Unlike traditional methods like Proof of Stake (PoS) or Proof of Work (PoW), PoI rewards meaningful AI computations instead of wasting resources on unnecessary tasks. This approach not only saves energy but also contributes directly to AI innovation. Plus, it’s environmentally conscious. 2. Practical Utility With AIVM Blockchains that promise a lot but deliver little are a thing of the past. The AIVM is set to power the next generation of decentralized apps designed for AI-specific purposes—from predictive analytics to natural language processing (NLP). Developers are already considering this platform as the smartest choice for their next big project. 3. The Numbers Speak For Themselves A presale price of $0.003 is almost unheard of for a project with this level of innovation. Let’s break down how $300 could grow into $100K. $300 at $0.003 gets you 100,000 $LCAI tokens If $LCAI hits $1 (a reasonable target for 2025 based on its roadmap), that’s $100,000. For some context, early adopters of tokens like Solana and Binance Coin saw similar entry prices turn into significant returns. Lightchain AI is following a similar trajectory but with a groundbreaking focus on technology. 4. Supported By A Strong Roadmap This isn’t a short-lived project. The Lightchain Roadmap is detailed and extends all the way to its Mainnet Launch. Testnets are operational, validator nodes are ready, and discussions with major industry players are already underway. Progress is steady, and the timeline is clear. Phase 1- Prototype Creation and Community Development Phase 2- Testnet Release and Optimization Phase 3- Mainnet Activation (the big moment!) The milestones planned for 2024 are set to make waves. If $LCAI achieves even a portion of its goals, 100x gains may prove to be an underestimation. Wrapping Up Things Investing in Lightchain AI presents a unique opportunity to gain exposure to the growing intersection of blockchain and artificial intelligence technologies. Its innovative approach, solid fundamentals, and potential for exponential growth make it a compelling investment option for those seeking transformative opportunities in the crypto market. However, as with any investment, it is important to conduct thorough research and understand the risks involved before committing funds. With its upcoming Mainnet launch and strong roadmap, Lightchain AI has the potential to be one of the biggest success stories of 2024/2025. Are you ready to join the revolution?

The move potentially ends a legal saga and a standoff between the US and South Korea over competing extradition demands for Do Kwon. Do Kwon To Be Extradited The decision to extradite Do Kwon to the US was approved by Montenegro’s Justice Minister Bojan Bozovic. The move comes after a Supreme Court ruling and legal evaluation, which lasted for over a year. According to Montenegro’s Supreme Court, both the US and South Korea had met legal conditions for extradition. “JUST IN: Terra Luna Founder Do Kwon to be extradited to the United States.” Do Kwon and his business partner Han Cheng Jun were arrested in March 2023 at Podgorica airport, attempting to travel to Dubai using forged passports. Kwon also served a four-month prison sentence in Montenegro for document forgery. Montenegro’s Ministry of Justice said in a statement, “The Ministry of Justice examined all the facts and circumstances, including the severity of the crimes, the jurisdiction of the offenses, and the extradition requests. Most criteria favored the US request. Most criteria envisaged by the law are in favor of the extradition demands from the institutions of the United States of America.” Bozovic decided on Friday but did not specify when the handover would happen. The Charges Against Do Kwon Do Kwon faces charges in New York and Seoul over the collapse of the TerraUSD stablecoin in 2022, which led to losses worth a staggering $40 billion and the collapse of several prominent crypto companies. The Manhattan US Attorney’s office brought fraud charges against Do Kwon last year but has not commented on Montenegro’s decision. US authorities claim that Do Kwon misled investors and believe he is hiding substantial assets. Furthermore, it is unclear if Friday’s decision is final because courts in Montenegro have also previously ruled that Do Kwon must be extradited to South Korea instead of the US. Do Kwon’s lawyer, Goran Rodic, who attempted to get him extradited to South Korea, has also not spoken about the decision. Terraform and Do Kwon were found personally liable for fraud after a civil trial following allegations by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Following the trial, Terraform has agreed to pay $4.5 billion and settle the case with the SEC. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The big banks, who once rolled their eyes at crypto and left it to the small fry, are now elbowing their way into the market. They see the dollar signs, and apparently, they’ve decided that reputation be damned. The fees are too good to ignore. Bitcoin’s transformation from “hyped-up fraud” (thanks Jamie Dimon ) to a cash cow has been nothing short of wild. The SEC approved Bitcoin spot ETFs. Add Trump’s return to office and his administration’s apparent crypto-friendliness, and you’ve got Wall Street rolling up its sleeves and getting dirty. Big money and bigger risks for Wall Street Barclays and Citigroup are leading the charge, underwriting multiple convertible bond offerings for MicroStrategy. JPMorgan’s also in the mix, doing the same thing for big Bitcoin miners like Core Scientific and Mara. Even Goldman Sachs is cashing in, raising funds for Applied Digital, a company that builds data centers for Bitcoin miners. More than $13 billion in crypto-related convertible bonds have been issued this year, most of it in just the past few months. Fees? Banks are raking in at least $200 million from these deals, according to estimates. MicroStrategy alone has handed over 2% fees on its mind-blowing $21 billion equity offering. But don’t think Wall Street’s gone full crypto fanboy. The big players are still picky. Coinbase, a well-established exchange, is a safer bet than, say, a startup Bitcoin miner. Even among similar companies, reputational baggage matters. MicroStrategy might be a Bitcoin darling, but Michael Saylor’s legal history isn’t exactly squeaky clean. Still, when the fees are this fat, banks seem willing to hold their noses. And since a few big banks jump in, the rest can’t afford to sit on the sidelines. Competition is fierce, and no banker wants to explain to their boss why they’re slipping in the league tables. That said, Wall Street’s love for crypto has its limits. The banks still draw the line with certain industries. Adult entertainment and cannabis—legal but taboo sectors—are still no-go zones for many. Crypto straddles that line, a gray area where respectability clashes with profit potential.

The report also talks about big changes in DeFi, stablecoins, and how institutions might embrace crypto in the coming years. Crypto Predictions for 2025 from @glxyresearch Featuring… bitcoin and ether price, ETHBTC, both Dogecoin and D.O.G.E., stablecoins, defi, L2s, policy, VC, and more… Here are the predictions we just sent to @galaxyhq clients and counterparties — Galaxy Research (@glxyresearch) December 27, 2024 Bitcoin and Ethereum to Go Higher Bitcoin is expected to surpass $150,000 in the first half of the year, potentially hitting $185,000 by year-end, driven by institutional, corporate, and even nation-state adoption. Ethereum, too, is set to shine, with its price predicted to climb above $5,500, fueled by regulatory clarity and partnerships between decentralized finance (DeFi) and traditional finance (TradFi). US Spot Bitcoin ETP Growth The total value of Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) in the U.S. will exceed $250 billion. This growth reflects increased institutional and retail interest in Bitcoin. Bitcoin as a Top Asset Bitcoin will outperform most other assets globally when considering risk and returns. Its resilience will make it a favorite for both retail and institutional investors. Wealth Management Allocation Leading financial platforms will recommend allocating at least 2% of portfolios to Bitcoin. This will encourage more investors to include Bitcoin in their long-term plans. Corporate and National Adoption Five major Nasdaq-listed companies and five countries will add Bitcoin to their reserves. This will solidify Bitcoin’s role as a global asset for both corporations and nations. Bitcoin Protocol Upgrade Developers will agree on a significant upgrade to Bitcoin’s technology . This could include new features to improve functionality and scalability. Mining Partnerships with AI Over half of the top Bitcoin mining companies will partner with AI or high-performance computing firms. These collaborations will enhance mining efficiency and reduce environmental impact. Bitcoin in DeFi The amount of Bitcoin used in decentralized finance (DeFi) will nearly double. This shows Bitcoin’s growing utility beyond being just a store of value. Ethereum Staking Boom Over 50% of Ethereum’s supply will be staked, showing confidence in its long-term value. Staking will also strengthen the network’s security. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Market Today (Dec 28, 2024): Bitcoin Stuck Below $95k, as Altcoins Struggle , ETH/BTC Ratio Fluctuation Ethereum’s value compared to Bitcoin will drop below $0.03 but recover to over $0.06 by year-end. This reflects shifting investor sentiment throughout the year. Layer 2 Dominance Layer 2 networks will generate more activity than alternative Layer 1 blockchains. They will offer faster and cheaper transactions, attracting more users. DeFi Dividend Era Decentralized applications will distribute at least $1 billion in rewards to users. This marks a shift toward sharing profits with participants. On-Chain Governance Revival DeFi projects will experiment with new governance models to involve users in decision-making. This will make the ecosystem more decentralized and innovative. Custodian Banks Enter Crypto The world’s four largest custodian banks will start offering crypto services. This will bridge the gap between traditional finance and digital assets. New Stablecoins At least ten new stablecoins will launch, backed by traditional finance partners. These stablecoins will bring more liquidity and trust to the market. Stablecoin Supply Surge The total supply of stablecoins will double to over $400 billion. This reflects the growing demand for stable, blockchain-based assets. Tether’s Market Share Decline Tether’s dominance will drop below 50%, facing competition from alternatives like USDC and new offerings like BlackRock’s BUIDL. Crypto Venture Capital Boom Venture capital investment in crypto will exceed $150 billion, growing by over 50% year-over-year. This influx will fuel innovation across the industry. Stablecoin Legislation The U.S. Congress will pass laws regulating stablecoins , signed by President Trump in 2025. However, broader crypto market regulations will remain unresolved. U.S. Bitcoin Reserves The U.S. government won’t buy more Bitcoin but will use its existing holdings to build reserves. Agencies will explore policies for managing Bitcoin reserves. SEC Investigates Prometheum The SEC will investigate Prometheum, a special-purpose broker-dealer. This could set a precedent for how crypto platforms are regulated. Dogecoin Hits $1 Dogecoin will finally reach $1 , with its market cap soaring to $100 billion. This will make the memecoin a major player in the crypto world. The year-ending predictions are setting a bullish tone for the year 2025, though the market is also cautious about a potential market crash after Trump officially takes charge till then it’s all speculative. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

This marked the highest trading activity in three months for the network, reaffirming its dominance in the NFT ecosystem. The surge underscores not just the Ethereum’s resilience but also its ability to evolve and capture speculative momentum. Whether this marks the beginning of a sustained NFT revival or a temporary bubble, the spotlight remains firmly on Ethereum and its ecosystem of innovators. Pudgy Penguins Drive Ethereum NFT Resurgence The surge was largely driven by the Pudgy Penguins collection, which generated an astonishing $108 million in trading volume. This spike followed the much-anticipated launch of the collection’s native PENGU token . The launch not only attracted traders but also saw individual Pudgy Penguins NFTs trading for over 29 ETH before a sharp cooldown post-token issuance. The $PENGU token distribution extended beyond traditional holders, incorporating eligible wallets from both Ethereum and Solana ecosystems. This strategy broadened the market impact, pulling in new participants and sparking speculative interest in Ethereum-based NFTs. Prominent Collections The Pudgy Penguins’ success appeared to set off a chain reaction across other leading NFT collections. Notable projects like Azuki and Doodles witnessed major upticks in trading activity, recording $23 million and $17 million in volumes, respectively. Speculators seemed to anticipate similar token launches from these collections, fueling a broader shift in market expectations toward tokenized NFT ecosystems. Ethereum’s commanding lead in the NFT sector remains evident, with its $186 million trading volume vastly overshadowing Bitcoin’s $33 million for the same period. While competing chains have made strides in building their own NFT ecosystems, the sheer scale of Ethereum’s activity highlights its continued role as the go-to platform for high-value transactions and innovation. As the market digests the implications of the Pudgy Penguins’ tokenization strategy, speculation grows over whether other major collections will follow suit. The success of $PENGU may well set a precedent, sparking a new wave of token launches aimed at revitalizing NFT markets.

In 2025, it will range between $0.5961 and $0.7106, with an average price of $0.6128. In 2030, it will range between $4.01 and $4.77, with an average price of $4.12. Algorand’s capabilities make it an interesting prospect for investors and developers interested in smart contracts and blockchain interoperability. A 2019 video featured Gary Gensler, Securities and Exchange Commission chair, referring to Algorand as a great technology and using it as an example when discussing the decentralization of cryptocurrencies. Will ALGO go up? Can it reach $10? Where will ALGO be in 5 years? We explore these and more in our Cryptopolitan price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Algorand Ticker ALGO Current price $0.3335 Market cap $2.77B Trading volume $197.13M Circulating supply 8.33B All-time high $3.28 on Jun 21, 2019 All-time low $0.08761 on Sep 11, 2023 24-hour high $0.3581 24-hour low $0.3284 Algorand price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day variation) 14.22% 50-day SMA $0,3273 200-day SMA $0.1821 Sentiment Neutral Fear and Greed Index 72 (Greed) Green days 16/30 (53%) Algorand price analysis As of December 28, ALGO’s price had risen by 16.23% in 30 days, making it one of the best-performing mega-altcoins in the last quarter of 2024. Algorand’s total value locked (TVL), the amount of funds locked up by an ecosystem’s decentralized applications has been volatile and bullish in December as users deposit their assets into the protocol. On the contrary, the protocol’s stablecoin market cap tanked to the $38M level in November from $135M, then proceeded with a gradual recovery. The value is now at $57M. The statistics pointed to growing user interest in the protocol’s stablecoins, which provide stability in the highly volatile market. Algorand 1-day chart analysis ALGO/USD 1-day chart.

Per our technical indicators, ALGO’s price trend is neutral, and the fear and greed index shows greed among investors. Data analysis, however, shows rising activity in decentralized finance applications and stablecoin demand. Why is ALGO up? ALGO is trading at previous highs set in 2022, the recovery could be attributed to the crypto market’s general bullish sentiment which saw its market cap rise above $3.2 trillion. Will ALGO reach $0.15? ALGO’s monthly resistance level stands at $0.15. With the negative market momentum rising, a correction breakout is highly probable. Will ALGO reach $10? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely for ALGO to break above $10 in the period ending 2030. Will ALGO reach $100? At $100, Algorand market capitalization has to rise above $700 billion from the current $1.2 billion. In comparison, Ethereum’s market capitalization is at $400 billion. Per our price prediction, Algorancd is highly unlikely to reach $100. Does ALGO have a good long-term future? Like most mega-altcoins, Algorand is trading at its lowest level this year. A break below 30 RSI will be crucial to sending it to previous highs. Looking ahead, ALGO will register new all-time highs in the coming years. Is ALGO a good investment? Analysis by Intotheblock shows that 97% of holders are at a loss at the current price. The figure will likely drop lower in the short term. However, as our Cryptopolitan price prediction shows, this will change over the long term. Recent news The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) now offers blockchain education training to 24,000 personnel worldwide to UNDP, UN Volunteers, and the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF). The training for the academy is in partnership with the Algorand Foundation , an organization focused on enabling an inclusive, decentralized, and borderless global economy.

Algorand historic price sentiment Algorand price history: Coinstats Algorand held its token sale in June 2019 at $2.4 each. Union Square Ventures, Lemniscap, and NGC Ventures, among others, held earlier funding rounds. The public sale raised $60.40 million while funding rounds raised $66 million. Token sale participants who held their tokens since launch are down 90%. Binance listed ALGO on 21 June 2019. According to Coinmarketcap data, it pumped after the listing to reach its all-time high (ATH) at $3.28. ALGO later crashed; four months later, it was down 90% from ATH. In July 2021, Coinbase listed ALGO. As a result, it gradually recovered and peaked at $0.637 in August. In retrospect, 2021 was the golden year for the crypto market. The emergence of NFTs, DeFi growth, and institutional interest drove growth. So, in 2021, it rose from a low of $0.32 in January to $2.3 in October, a 200% gain. Nothing prepared crypto enthusiasts for the 2023 crypto winter, which worsened with the FTX crash. The year closed with ALGO trading at $0.23. The decline continued through 2023, registering an all-time low at $0.0876 in September. The market’s recovery began in October. By the end of the year, it had risen above $0.2. It now trades at $0.13. It began recovering in November from a low of $0.12, rising as high as $0.59 in December.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ALGO|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-28 11:45:37

With the year coming to an end in just a few days, on-chain data actually shows that this could all change in a rather unexpected fashion. Trading Volumes Mean Gains? The broader end of 2024 was quite spectacular as BTC skyrocketed from under $70,000 to over $108,000 within less than two months after the US presidential elections. On a micro-scale, though, the asset has been struggling for the past ten days as it tumbled from that aforementioned all-time high to $92,000 in days and sits at $94,000 now. Moreover, the trading volumes have slumped in the past week, which is quite expected given the Holiday season. That, though, could actually be the propeller of a price rally, according to data from Santiment. The analytics platform indicated that in times of low trading volumes, whales play a particularly important role if their accumulation levels continue. In the final days of 2024, trading volume is way down across crypto sectors.

In fact, “speculative altcoins” are even more susceptible to price gains on such occasions, which could be beneficial for meme coins such as DOGE. On-chain data shared by Ali Martinez indicates that Dogecoin whales used the dip to acquire more of the largest meme coin in the past few days. Whales bought over 90 million #Dogecoin $DOGE in the past 48 hours! pic.twitter.com/lGsMtz0iPp — Ali (@ali_charts) December 27, 2024 Stablecoins on Binance The other factor is the growing stablecoin reserve on the world’s largest crypto exchange.

With 2024 fast approaching, three Ethereum-based coins are becoming the talk of the town with the potential to make a smaller $1000 investment into a life-changing $100,000. So, we’ve got Shiba Inu (SHIB), Floki (FLOKI), and the new kid on the block, Yeti Ouro (YETIO), all of which offer their own unique features and growth potential. Shiba Inu (SHIB): The ‘Dogecoin Killer’ Since its introduction, Shiba Inu dubbed the “Dogecoin killer,” has taken the crypto world by storm. Although there was a recent setback, with a decrease of 11.68% in the last month, SHIB price is still holding firm on the market and Shiba Inu has a strong community. 1-month Shiba Inu price chart- source: CoinMarketCap SHIB’s huge supply of 589.5 trillion tokens has created a minute price, but this hasn’t stopped its ardent fanbase. With developments in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), it’s possible that the project’s ecosystem will continue to grow and drive future price appreciation. Floki (FLOKI): The Meme Coin Inspired By A Viking Named for Elon Musk’s Shiba Inu, Floki has found its place in the meme coin space. FLOKI has fallen 18.98% in the last month but remains a community-driven project with an ambitious roadmap. 1-month FLOKI price chart- source: CoinMarketCap Through NFTs, gaming metaverse, and education platforms, FLOKI’s team is looking to build utility while stepping towards integrating its coins into the online merchant world. Such initiatives could result in massive value for FLOKI holders over the coming years. Yeti Ouro (YETIO): A Game Changer For New Users Now, let us consider the newcomer who is piquing the excitement of the crypto world: Yeti Ouro. YETIO is far from a run-of-the-mill meme coin; it is a utility generator in an innovative new gaming ecosystem. Yeti Ouro’s centerpiece is Yeti Go, a Play-to-Earn (P2E) racing game developed on the Unreal Engine. This high-octane game aims to mix the fast-paced world of racing with the ability to earn crypto. Knock rivals from the platforms, use power-ups, dodge obstacles, and earn YETIO tokens; that’s what players will do. What makes YETIO unique is its actual use within the Yeti Go ecosystem: In-game purchases: Get skins, power-ups, and other items to customize your racing experience. Race entry fees: Compete in higher-stakes tournaments for bigger YETIO rewards. Marketplace: Trade goods and collectibles with other players. Stake: Lock up your tokens for extra rewards and exclusive features The Yeti Ouro dev team works hard to enable a seamless and intuitive gamer player experience. They are putting in work to make sure Yeti Go doesn’t lean too much either way, crazy fun or strategic gameplay, which is good because casual gamers and crypto enthusiasts alike will use Yeti Go. Don’t Fade Yeti Ouro Referral Campaign Yeti Ouro Introduction Referral Campaign Yeti Ouro is also a referral-based project. Those who refer friends to join the presale will receive a 10% bonus as an investor. It allows you to earn more tokens while adding another member to the Yeti Ouro family! The referral program is easy to join. This unique referral link can be found on the Yeti Ouro dashboard for all investors. When they share this link with their friends and fellow crypto enthusiasts, not only do they earn more YETIO, but they are also another building block to the future of this exciting project. Looking Ahead Heading into 2024, Yeti Ouro is one of the projects with the most potential. Whereas the likes of Shiba Inu and Floki still lean heavily on community support and the meme culture that we have seen has a lot to offer, YETIO has something unique on its hands, a mixture of gaming excitement and crypto innovation which could see it carve out a substantial portion in both markets. For investors who want to convert $1000 to $100,000, YETIO is showing you an early phase of a project with a direct and apparent utility and growth potential. Yeti Ouro is poised to ride this wave towards greatness, as gaming and crypto have become a successful formula for the blockchain world.

Alex Thorn, head of research at Galaxy Research, said in a December 27 report: “The US government will not buy Bitcoin in 2025. However, there will be some movement at the departmental level to consider an expanded BTC reserve policy”. The fact that it’s considering the reserve policy suggests this is more about long-term positions rather than short-term market positioning. Bitcoin Act 2024: A Game-Changer? The proposed BTC Act 2024 by Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming could be a game-changer in the US government’s approach toward BTC. If passed, the act would grant the government the power to purchase 200,000 BTC every year over a period of five years, amassing a reserve of 1 million BTC to be held for a minimum of 20 years. Such a daring move could place Bitcoin at the heart of the US Treasury’s approach. Broader Global Perspectives It’s not just about the US, however. Galaxy analyst “JW” believes up to five Nasdaq 100 companies and nation-states could join the party by adding BTC to their respective balance sheets or sovereign wealth funds by 2025. The Japanese Prime Minister, Shigeru Ishiba, also acknowledged global interest but sounded uncertain. “It is difficult for the government to express its views”, Ishiba said, citing a lack of understanding about BTC reserve strategies by countries like the US. At the same time, former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao suggested that smaller countries could very well take the lead in the implementation of BTC reserves. At the Bitcoin MENA conference in Abu Dhabi, Zhao highlighted the gradual nature of this shift, saying strategic adoption could start with the smaller-scale nations. Competitive Dynamics in Bitcoin Adoption The shifting US government position might have implications for the global approach. JW believes that a more aggressive US position could result in a race to adopt Bitcoin among nations. “Competition among unaligned or adversarial nations will drive strategies to mine or acquire Bitcoin,” JW said. As BTC continues to mature as an asset globally, nations and corporations alike will likely revisit their strategies. While the US is unlikely to buy BTC in 2025, its policy shifts may pave the way for broader adoption and competition in the cryptocurrency space.",Blockchain|Regulation|Web3,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2024-12-28 12:02:47

The scam uses deceptive Google ads to redirect users to fake websites, stealing crypto wallet credentials. This attack coincides with the growing popularity of the PENGU token, which has seen massive gains. Experts warn that this sophisticated scam highlights the increasing threats to Web3 security, urging users to verify URLs and use ad blockers to protect their assets. Sophisticated Phishing Scam Targets Pudgy Penguins NFT Holders The Pudgy Penguins phishing scam has emerged as a serious threat to crypto security, specifically targeting NFT holders of the popular project. The scam involves malicious Google ads hosted on the Adloox tracking domain, which execute harmful JavaScript code to detect Web3 wallets. If a wallet is detected, users are redirected to a counterfeit Pudgy Penguins website, “pudqypenguin[.]com,” designed to steal sensitive information like wallet credentials and private keys. This attack exploits vulnerabilities in well-established ad networks, making it especially deceptive as it appears on trusted websites. Scammers use the Prebid.js header bidding library, along with the Adloox analytics module, to serve these harmful ads to unsuspecting users. The fake websites closely resemble the official Pudgy Penguins platform, making it difficult for users to detect the scam. Security experts like Scam Sniffer and ZachXBT have issued warnings and advised users to remain vigilant. To avoid falling victim to this scam, users should use ad blockers, check URLs before connecting their wallets, and employ separate browsers for crypto activities. This attack underscores the rising risks in the Web3 space and calls for stronger user education and security practices. Recently, Animoca Brands founder Yat Siu’s X account was compromised and the bad actors promoted a fake token. However, the team quickly addressed the issue and asked investors to not engage in the post. PENGU Token Price and Market Performance Released on December 17, the PENGU token has become a dominant player in the Solana meme coin space. The recent PENGU airdrop and major listings has gained traction from the broader market, which in turned boosted its prices higher. However, its price has slightly dipped by 3%, trading at $0.03472. Over the past 24 hours, its low and high were $0.03325 and $0.03557, respectively. PENGU token boasts a market cap of $2.17 billion with a trading volume of $446 million, solidifying its position above competitors like BONK and WIF.

The group is fighting against new IRS laws that will classify some protocols in the DeFi sector as brokers. The new regulation will mandate the protocols to give up user transaction details through the Know Your Customer (KYC) information. According to the IRS, the new regulation could affect about 875 DeFi protocols, a move that has triggered the entire crypto community. The new law intends to treat any platform that traders buy and sell assets in the DeFi sector as a broker. Legal experts strongly oppose the move, citing several constitutional rights violations. Investors are also wary about the security issues that the proposed KYC details may present. Blockchain Association files lawsuit to counter the IRS The initial IRS directive was met with market-wide dissatisfaction, with traders objecting to the regulations. In response to their dissatisfaction, the IRS said it will ensure that the right people are paying their taxes promptly. With the controversy still in the air, the Blockchain Association announced that it has filed its lawsuit challenging the new regulation. Today, @BlockchainAssn , @fund_defi , and @TXblockchain_ filed a lawsuit challenging the IRS’ broker rulemaking. This rule – as the countless comment letters warned – risks crippling the U.S. digital asset sector. https://t.co/D8VsDpNJvW pic.twitter.com/8HDvpIhBHC — Blockchain Association (@BlockchainAssn) December 28, 2024 According to its post on X (formerly Twitter), the Blockchain Association said it filed the lawsuit in collaboration with the DeFi Education Fund and the Texas Blockchain Council. The body stated that the rule could threaten the booming digital asset sector in the United States. It also mentioned that the same warnings had been communicated to the IRS through countless comment letters. According to the legal head of the association, Marisa Coppel, the IRS went beyond its statutory authority by leveling the protocols as brokers, noting that it is an infringement on people’s rights. “The IRS and Treasury have gone beyond their statutory in expanding the definition of ‘broker’ to include providers of DeFi trading front-ends even though they do not effectuate transactions. Not only is this an infringement on the privacy rights of individuals using decentralized technology, it would push this entire, burgeoning technology offshore.” She noted that the Blockchain Association will continue to stand with users and fight against any form of misguided regulations. “Blockchain Association continues to stand with innovators and users of DeFi and will continue to fight this misguided rule-making to ensure the United States remains a home for decentralized finance technology and developers alike,” she added. The crypto community criticizes the IRS Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith, some high-profile individuals in the crypto sector, and the entire community have also criticized the move, with others offering support. Smith has urged the IRS to reverse the rules, expressing strong opposition to some aspects of it. She is also confident that the incoming Trump administration will understand the dire effects that such a move may have on innovation in the country. Representing the legal community and showing displeasure at the regulations, Variant Chief Legal Officer Jake Chervinsky has noted that the regulation is a dying gasp from the anti-crypto army. He also urged the court to overturn the regulations, saying if the court refuses to do the needful, the new administration will do it. General Counsel of A16z Crypto, Miles Jennings has criticized the rule, saying it is an overreach. He said the new rules give the IRS the authority to regulate, sanction, or even ban DeFi platforms. Some users on X have also called it an intentional move by the Biden administration to sabotage the incoming pro-crypto Trump administration. The crypto community has always come together to criticize regulations that may hinder the growth of the crypto industry. With the incoming pro-crypto Trump administration, there is confidence that laws like these will be rejected outrightly.

In a new video, the analyst pseudonymously known as Credible Crypto tells his 65,700 YouTube subscribers that payments-focused digital asset XRP has one of the most bullish market structures in crypto based on the charts. “[XRP] is probably the most bullish altcoin in the space right now… XRP is one of the few coins right now that is printing a very clear bullish impulsive structure on lower time frames, on higher time frames, on every time frame. And very easily cleanly identifiable… That’s kind of what we’re seeing here on XRP – is that very clean price action that shows impulsive price movement.” Source: Credible Crypto/X The pseudonymous analyst, who regularly applies the Elliott Wave theory in his technical analysis, says that XRP could explode by up to 1,295% from the current level. In technical analysis, the Elliott Wave theory suggests that a bullish asset witnesses a five-wave rally before a correction occurs in a three-wave pattern. Says Credible, “I do think XRP here is gearing up for that next impulse to the upside following the one that started off at $1.28. Again this next initial impulse to the upside should… take us to $4+ and new all-time highs. The exciting thing is that would be just a third sub-wave of a larger third-wave move that ultimately should take us to $5+ plus. And by the time we’re gearing up for this final fifth wave, I would imagine that we would have hit double digits at that point. And this fifth wave will take us to the blow-off top or the final top of $20 to $30.” Source: Credible Crypto/X XRP is trading at $2.15 at time of writing.

Following the footsteps of Dogecoin, this looming exchange-traded-product launch has echoed substantial optimism over other meme coins’ future actions. Market watchers anticipate more such offerings ahead, primarily as the broader market expects more such financial products ahead. Floki ETP Launch Echoes Optimism Over Other Meme Coins’ Future Notably, the Floki community has been reportedly making monumental strides in the wake of its ETP creation. CoinGape recently reported that the token’s community has also passed a crucial proposal ensuring the creation of liquidation for an ETP launch. Meanwhile, the community also aims to burn a certain amount of tokens in preparation for its ETP creation. Overall, the broader market expects the ETP creation to substantially bolster the price of the leading dog meme-themed crypto . Notably, Dogecoin, another leading meme coin , that saw phenomenal gains this cycle, witnessed an ETP launch in November. The meme coin witnessed the Valour Dogecoin ETP launch, enhancing the meme-themed asset’s market visibility. Overall, these ETP launches have glimmered immense hope for future exchange-traded products backed by meme-themed coins such as BONK, PEPE, & others. Will A Meme Coin Rally Commence In 2025? Given that ETPs backed by other meme tokens are launched moving ahead, the broader sector could witness phenomenal gains. Previously, CoinGape reported that the Bonk community was eyeing an ETP launch in the U.S. for retail and institutional investors. Notably, the project’s team was in work with New York-based Osprey Funds for the ETP launch. This saga has injected an additional dose of optimism among investors expecting other meme coin-backed ETPs. While Floki ETP is expected to bring more institutional interest toward the coin, it could also pave the way for other meme coin ETPs as well, causing a bullish ripple effect for the broader sector.

Technical indicators as well as the price chart give out a bullish verdict regarding the current market scenario. Is XRP a good investment? XRP, a cryptocurrency specifically tailored for rapid and cost-effective cross-border transactions, holds promise within global finance. The extent of adoption and Ripple’s strides in forging strategic partnerships are pivotal in shaping XRP’s value trajectory. As with any investment, the outlook for XRP remains uncertain, necessitating a cautious approach and thorough due diligence. Why is XRP up? The XRP/USD crypto pair price has increased as the buying influx was abruptly taken, taking the price to $2.157. The RSI has also risen above 40, the continual upside can lead beyond the neutral region. Will XRP recover? XRP is dipping over the short term; nevertheless, the drop in price levels is gradual, with bullish periods in between. The price action is nothing unusual in the crypto market, with equal chances of price reversal. Will XRP reach $1? XRP will have to surpass several resistance levels to reach $1. With a not-very-solid bearish trend and XRP’s current price action, it is possible that the coin can get $1 by next year as demand for XRP tokens rises and XRP’s growth remains consistent. The last time XRP was seen on the $1 level was November 30, 2021. Will XRP reach $10? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, XRP has a low chance of reaching $10 in the next five years. However, it is expected to reach $10 by 2031 if XRP ecosystem adoption by major financial institutions continues which still makes it a good option to buy XRP. Will XRP reach $100? If one XRP coin is worth $100, its market cap must be more than $5.4 trillion. Comparatively, Bitcoin’s market cap is $1.18 trillion; considering the current global economic situation, it is unlikely for XRP to reach $100 under current market dynamics. Does XRP have a good long-term future? XRP is expected to increase in value gradually over the coming years giving good yields to XRP holders and institutional investors. Currently, the coin is trading at the lowest level of the last year; however, it is expected to reach the highest price of $7 by 2030, which makes it a valuable asset for multiple gains after significant market capitalization with continuous efforts by Ripple Labs. However, regulatory uncertainties still linger on with the Ripple lawsuit. Recent news/opinions on the Ripple Network Raoul Pal, CEO of Real Vision, admitted his misjudgment about XRP as the token surged past $2. It now ranks third in cryptocurrency market capitalization, with Ripple’s market cap climbing 22% and its 24-hour trading volume rising by 21.81% to $19.27 billion on December 2, 2024. Read more about it here . Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research, comments on the XRP price, noting that XRP is a relic of past crypto trends. Large holders are disappointed, and investors are becoming less interested due to its lack of innovation and frequent legal entanglements. The future market performance for XRP is still grim if it can’t address its legal problems or provide creative applications.

XRP historic price sentiment Before 2017, the asset’s value hovered around $0.01; in April 2017, it rose to $0.05; the gradual climb soon continued as it reached $0.25 in May, showing a positive price action as Ripple continued to excel. XRP price history Towards the end of 2019, XRP price stabilized at around $0.30 and did not cross the $0.5 mark throughout the year. However, the bullish run of 2020 pushed the coin’s value to a peak price of $0.8, gaining investor interest before finishing the year at $0.66. Early 2021 was supposed to be bullish for XRP, but the SEC announced a lawsuit that derailed investors. Nonetheless, XRP beat the odds and surged above $1.5 during the year, but by 2022 it plummeted significantly to as low as $0.31. XRP started 2023 at $0.335, and on July 13, it almost doubled its value in a steep spike. It shot from $0.470 to $0.814 while swinging towards $0.9 for a few hours. A partial victory against the SEC triggered the price jump, surging the trading volume. XRP closed 2023 at about $0.62. In 2024, XRP has so far ridden the market wave. The bears earlier on and then a bullish price movement by mid-March resulted in a market price of $0.72, according to data from the cryptocurrency market. In July, XRP traded between $0.418 and $0.658, showing a good recovery. However, the coin went under bearish pressure at the start of August, falling back down to the $0.550 range as per crypto markets records showing high volatility. In September 2024, XRP recovered up to the $0.642 level, but the price went down to the $0.500 range in October. A tremendous bullish impulse was observed in November when XRP touched the $1.96 mark and is trading above $2 at the start of December.",Crypto Price Predictions|Ripple|XRP,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-28 12:56:00

New tax rules for DeFi platforms will take effect from 2027. The IRS will treat DeFi platforms facilitating transactions as brokers. The U.S. Treasury Department, through the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), has finalized regulation integrating decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms into the existing tax framework. In a recent report, the regulatory agency noted that the new rules will be implemented in 2027, allowing the platforms to organize their data for proper reporting. It is worth clarifying that the new regulation targets “trading front-end service providers,” which the IRS has classified as brokers due to their intermediary roles in facilitating digital asset transactions. The IRS believes that this classification will improve tax compliance within the growing DeFi sector. According to the IRS, the new rule classifies platforms offering digital assets sales or exchanges as brokers, regardless of whether they use smart contracts.

While the United States is often seen as a leader in both financial and technological advancement, it has clearly struggled in recent years to establish clear (and consistent) crypto regulation frameworks. You might also like: Can global regulation keep up with the tokenization boom? | Opinion This lack of clarity has allowed other countries, particularly in the Middle East and Asia, to take the lead. High-growth economies in these regions are creating frameworks tailored to digital assets, which are often more effective than those in the West. These regulations offer a model for the rest of the world to follow. If the West doesn’t catch up, it risks being left behind as the crypto industry shifts its center of gravity. The US should not be the blueprint for regulations In the past years, the US has struggled in its attempt to regulate the crypto industry, with regulatory entities, such as the SEC, often taking hostile and inconsistent measures. High-profile lawsuits against Ripple and Coinbase made headlines globally, which have cast a shadow over innovation and pushed some crypto firms to move to friendlier countries. The absence of clear guidelines from the SEC has left founders and investors walking on eggshells, uncertain if their next move could get them into legal trouble. One of the main issues is that the US has been trying to fit digital assets into existing laws (e.g., securities and commodities regulations), which were never designed for crypto in the first place. While the US’s newly elected crypto-friendly Congress indicates hope for progress, the country has a lot of catching up to do. Waiting for the United States to set the standard is no longer viable when others are already leading. Emerging markets are the hidden gem of regulations In the meantime, high-growth markets such as Indonesia and Malaysia have introduced a new way to approach crypto regulations, with an understanding that digital assets are not enemies but should be regulated like any other assets. While the US SEC spent years trying to classify cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum ( ETH ), as securities, Indonesia’s Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency (known as BAPPEBTI) officially classified all digital assets as commodities as early as 2019. In Malaysia, the Securities Commission created a comprehensive framework for crypto exchanges with high standards for licensing, investor protection, and anti-money laundering. This has also been implemented in Indonesia, which rolled out clearer rules for exchanges, such as mandatory client fund segregation, strong security demands, and token listing requirements. In both countries, these measures have reduced fraud and improved trust in the overall system, making using crypto safer for everyone (and more enticing!). This is the level of clarity and engagement we need as we move into broader web3 adoption globally. As a result, the Asian crypto market is thriving. The Indonesian crypto market surpassed $30 billion in transactions from January to October 2024, a 350% increase compared to the previous year. It is now the third-largest country globally for cryptocurrency adoption, just ahead of the U.S. In fact, in this index, seven of the top 20 countries are in Central and Southern Asia and Oceania, which signals that the crypto world is a multipolar industry. Emerging markets lead in crypto utility But why are high-growth markets seemingly more advanced in crypto regulations? It’s because in these markets, crypto utility shines brighter than anywhere else. Crypto addresses several pitfalls, such as high remittance costs and limited access to owning assets and investing. On average, remittance fees are around 6.65% of the amount sent, which can take a big portion out of what workers send back to their families. In the Philippines, remittances make up nearly 10% of the country’s GDP, showing just how important they are. Digital assets also serve as a hedge against inflation. In Asia and the Middle East, gold has traditionally been a safe and reliable asset that has been able to retain value over the years. However, access to owning physical gold is complicated, with high entry fees, storage issues, and a lack of accessibility for everyday people. Crypto allows the creation of tokenized gold, enabling consumers to own a tokenized, digital fraction of gold at a much lower price, thereby lowering barriers to entry. Crypto regulations in high-growth markets aren’t perfect, and it will take a few more years for them to become even more comprehensive. But these markets understand that effective regulation can’t be one-size-fits-all, and they are tailoring rules for real digital asset use cases. The future of crypto won’t be defined by Wall Street or Silicon Valley. It will be defined by the people who can use crypto daily to solve real-world problems and address the pitfalls of traditional finance. Which is exactly what crypto was made for.

Ripple (XRP) One of the most creative cryptocurrency initiatives, Ripple aims to transform international financial transactions. XRP, in contrast to conventional cryptocurrencies. Ripple is focused on resolving practical issues, especially those pertaining to international payments. It is a great candidate for widespread adoption because its main goal is to enable quick, affordable, and secure money transfers between banks and financial organisations. Ripple is unique because of its cutting-edge blockchain technology, which gets rid of the inefficiencies in conventional financial systems. With minimal costs, XRP transactions settle in three to five seconds, outperforming even the majority of cryptocurrencies and conventional wire transfers. As a result, Ripple is now the preferred partner of more than 300 financial institutions, such as American Express and Santander. Ripple’s decentralized blockchain, the XRP Ledger, can process 1,500 transactions per second and offers strong security without sacrificing scalability. Additionally, Ripple is actively pursuing regulatory certainty, which will result in important alliances and widespread usage. Ripple is regaining the trust of institutions and investors alike following its recent partial success in its continuing legal struggle with the SEC. XRP’s promise for 2025 rests in its capacity to take a bigger chunk of the $156 trillion cross-border payment market. Ripple’s cutting-edge infrastructure and practical applications make it a long-term winner as blockchain use increases. Retail and institutional investors have the chance to participate in a cryptocurrency that is not only speculative but also has the potential to revolutionize global banking through XRP. 3. Polkadot (DOT) Polkadot is a groundbreaking blockchain technology that tackles interoperability, one of the most important problems in the cryptocurrency industry. Polkadot, created by Dr. Gavin Wood, a co-founder of Ethereum, allows many blockchains, or parachains, to function in unison. This opens up previously unheard-of possibilities for decentralized apps by establishing a single ecosystem in which value and data may move freely. The distinctive feature of Polkadot is its shared security paradigm, which allows all parachains to profit from the strong security of the main relay chain. This guarantees that Polkadot-based projects continue to be safe and scalable. Furthermore, the Substrate architecture allows developers to design unique blockchains for certain use cases without sacrificing compatibility. In Polkadot’s ecosystem, the native coin, DOT, is essential. In order to keep the network decentralized and community-driven, it is utilized for bonding, staking, and governance. In addition to helping to secure the network, investors may stake their DOT tokens to get alluring returns. Polkadot has a competitive edge thanks to its emphasis on scalability and interoperability as blockchain technology approaches widespread usage. Polkadot is anticipated to develop into a center for decentralized ecosystems by 2025, which would make DOT a valuable asset with substantial room for expansion. Polkadot offers a distinctive value offering that blends creativity, utility, and sustainability, regardless of your level of experience as an investor. 4. Chainlink (LINK) As the industry-leading decentralized oracle network, Chainlink is essential to integrating blockchain-based smart contracts with actual facts. Simply said, Chainlink makes it possible for smart contracts to access external data feeds, APIs, and other off-chain resources. As a result, it is essential for supply chain management, insurance, and decentralized finance (DeFi). Chainlink’s strong infrastructure guarantees the security and dependability of data. Because it is decentralized, there is no chance of manipulation, guaranteeing that smart contracts operate precisely in accordance with actual circumstances. With connectors spanning Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Solana, and more, this special capability has made Chainlink the preferred choice for important blockchain projects. A key component of Chainlink’s ecosystem, the LINK token serves as both a staking tool to guarantee data integrity and a payment method for node operators. The need for LINK is increasing along with the use of smart contracts, which makes it a desirable investment choice. In order to improve its usefulness and security, Chainlink is extending its products with cutting-edge features like staking and the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). Chainlink is positioned to be a key player in integrating blockchain technology with conventional industries by 2025. LINK is among the top cryptocurrencies for long-term returns because it provides investors with a unique blend of solid fundamentals and market demand. 5. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin, which was first developed as a joke, has grown to become one of the most well-known cryptocurrencies in the world. What began as a humorous meme currency has gained widespread notice, a devoted following, and practical applications. Dogecoin has proven its resilience in the erratic cryptocurrency market with support from well-known individuals like Elon Musk. Dogecoin has an infinite supply, which makes it an inflationary currency in contrast to Bitcoin, which has a 21 million coin restriction. Even though this may appear to be a disadvantage, it guarantees that DOGE will continue to be a useful medium for regular transactions. It is the best option for tipping, charity gifts, and microtransactions because of its quick processing times and minimal transaction costs. Dogecoin’s potential for development in 2025 rests on its capacity to take advantage of widespread use. Its increasing usefulness is demonstrated by recent advancements, including partnerships with retail platforms and integration with Tesla’s payment system. Additionally, the Dogecoin Foundation has created technological advancements to improve the security and scalability of the network. DOGE is a special opportunity for investors. Although there are dangers associated with its speculative character, its enormous community support and growing number of real-world applications make it a coin worth keeping an eye on. Dogecoin’s potential to evolve from a joke to a useful digital asset might result in substantial profits as the cryptocurrency industry develops. How Altcoins Work? Like Bitcoin, altcoins use blockchain technology to enable and secure transactions over decentralized, trustless peer-to-peer networks. The Ethereum blockchain serves as a distributed ledger, transparently and irrevocably documenting all contracts and transactions. One of the main advantages of blockchain technology is its transparency, which guarantees that everyone involved has access to the same data. Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) are two examples of consensus procedures used in cryptocurrency networks to validate transactions. PoS uses less energy since it depends on users holding and staking their coins to validate transactions, whereas PoW needs a lot of processing power to solve complicated issues. This staking procedure is a desirable choice for many as it not only promotes network security but also enables participants to get incentives. Altcoins’ decentralized structure and creative consensus techniques guarantee their continued security, openness, and censorship resistance. These characteristics make altcoins an attractive substitute for established financial systems, offering a more inclusive and intermediary-free future for financial transactions. Why Choose Altcoins? First, let’s ask the obvious: why not just use Bitcoin? Although Bitcoin is the forerunner of all cryptocurrencies, altcoins frequently have distinctive characteristics and cutting-edge technologies. Many address practical issues or enhance Bitcoin’s drawbacks, such as its scalability or energy usage. Additionally, altcoins often have lower entry costs, allowing you to purchase more units for less money. Additionally, during bull markets, they frequently enjoy larger percentage returns. Consider them the crypto equivalent of small-cap stocks: more risky but perhaps more lucrative. Factors to Consider Before Choosing the Best Altcoin To Buy Now It is crucial to carry out due diligence and comprehensive study before entering the altcoin investing industry. Investors may make wise choices and steer clear of potential traps by having a thorough understanding of the underlying technology, the project team, and the market potential. When in doubt, seeking advice from a financial adviser with expertise in cryptocurrency might yield insightful information. Although there are many potential benefits to investing in lesser-known cryptocurrencies, there are also many risks, including the potential for total loss. These risks can be mitigated by diversifying a cryptocurrency portfolio by holding a combination of well-known and prospective altcoins. Investors searching for expansion prospects may find altcoins appealing because to their distinctive features and cutting-edge technologies. The secret to investing in altcoins successfully is to be knowledgeable and flexible. Because the cryptocurrency market is so dynamic, investors may make more informed and timely decisions by staying up to date on the most recent news, trends, and regulatory developments. A well-rounded approach to altcoin investing enables investors to take advantage of the possibilities and negotiate the intricacies of the crypto markets. Pros and Cons of Altcoins Because of the cryptocurrency market’s potential for explosive development and innovation, investing in altcoins can yield substantial financial gains. By weighing the benefits and hazards of various digital assets, altcoins offer a means of diversifying a cryptocurrency portfolio. Some investors believe that altcoins provide a safer option when the economy is unstable, such during times of severe inflation. However, there are hazards associated with the altcoin market. In contrast to Bitcoin, which is widely accepted and has a strong market presence, many altcoins are more vulnerable to hazards, including market instability and fraud. The process of purchasing cryptocurrencies and verifying their legality can be made more difficult by issues with availability and governmental control. Setting specific investing objectives and using risk management strategies, such stop-loss orders, and altcoin diversification, are necessary to navigate these dangers. It might also be advantageous to have a long-term investment stance, concentrating on initiatives with sound foundations and practical uses. An investor might increase their chances of success in the altcoin markets by carefully preparing and researching prospective benefits. Conclusion: Best Altcoins To Buy Now It’s critical to consider each project’s long-term utility, scalability, and growth potential while looking for the best cryptocurrencies to invest in right now. Cryptocurrencies with distinctive value propositions that make them exceptional investments for 2025 and beyond include Dogecoin, Chainlink, Ripple, Polkadot, and LHUNT. From cutting-edge VR-blockchain integration to cross-border payments and decentralized oracles, each of these initiatives fills a unique niche and presents several chances for significant profits. LHUNT stands out as the best option among these. It is a once-in-a-generation investment opportunity due to its revolutionary methodology. LHUNT may pave the way for revolutionary returns in the upcoming years with a verified listing and the possibility of large staking payouts.

According to the SEC filing, these Bitcoin-hedged ETFs will strategically pair long positions in stocks or gold with short positions on the US dollar, complemented by long positions in Bitcoin through futures contracts. The ETF will allow ProShares to harness Bitcoin’s potential as an alternative asset while maintaining exposure to traditional financial markets. Importantly, the fund does not involve direct investments in Bitcoin itself. Observers see the filings as an indication of the growing market confidence in flagship crypto projects. REX had also proposed a new exchange-traded fund (ETF) aimed at investing in convertible bonds issued by companies that hold Bitcoin in their corporate treasuries How will the ProShare Bitcoin-hedged ETFs function? The filing outlines more details on how the ProShare Bitcoin hedged ETFs will look. Bitcoin futures contracts will execute the short US dollar/long Bitcoin component. The setup establishes a currency hedge against the US dollar exposure associated with S&P 500 stock positions. The hedge will shield against the fluctuation in dollar value relative to Bitcoin. Current events show Bitcoin’s increasing dominance within traditional finance spheres. Several traditional operators, mainly financial institutions , have devised ways of blending Bitcoin and other digital assets into mainstream investment strategies. Vocal financial advisory personalities, including Robert Kiyosaki, have also stressed that Bitcoin is yet to reach its peak, claiming that it will hit $350,000 by the end of 2025. Bitcoin ETF markets soared past $36 billion in investor capital The Bitcoin market has enjoyed a stable and comfortable environment, triggering its growth. Political developments, especially digital asset stakeholders who overtly supported the US president-elect, Donald Trump, have boosted crypto prospects. Trump has promised a favorable crypto environment during his administration, including establishing the National Bitcoin Reserve . The sentiments have raised optimism, driving the Bitcoin price to over $100,000. One of the most notable developments this year was the launch of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States on January 11. The ETFs allowed investors indirect ownership of Bitcoins without physical custody. The Bitcoin ETF market share has grown past $36 billion on the back of investors seeking crypto exposure.

If this selling pressure continues to increase, ETH could drop as low as $2,600. Let’s examine technical and on-chain analysis to determine Ethereum’s (ETH) health and what’s next. Ethereum Price Risks Correction As 110,000 ETH Flows to Exchanges Ethereum price has crashed 25% from its yearly high of $4,107 but has recovered to $3,358, where it currently trades. Since ETH trades between two key make-or-break hurdles at $3,613 and $3,029, there is no directional bias yet. If ETH overcomes the former hurdle, it could kickstart a rally to the upside. On the other hand, a breakdown of $3,029 could result in a crash. ETH/USDT 12-hour chart Considering the supply of Ethereum held on exchanges has seen an uptick of 110,000 ETH, a potential selloff could be around the corner. Typically, an increase in ETH held on centralized platforms could be for selling, aka booking profits or as collateral. This metric increases during the cycle top as more investors want to book profits. The supply held on exchanges reduces at the bottom as investors do not look to sell and instead secure their holdings on cold wallets. As a result, ETH prices could continue to decline in the near future. ETH Supply on Exchanges Ethereum Whales Book Profit After Recent Crash The Network Realized Profit/Loss indicator saw massive upticks on December 23 and 26, suggesting massive profit-taking activity from holders. Positive spikes note profit-taking and negative spikes indicate capitulation. If NPL is negative after a crash, it indicates that investors are capitulating and is a good area to buy. On the contrary, a positive spike after a drop suggests that holders are not confident in a future rally and are expecting a further decline in Ethereum prices. ETH NPL All in all, Ethereum price prediction suggests that a drop is likely. As noted, Ether needs to break the $3,029 support level to kickstart a correction that knocks it down to $2,600. Supporting this bearish outcome is ETH flooding on exchanges and profit-taking activity.

Two of the top memecoins during this wave of investment were Ethereum’s PEPE and Solana’s BONK, rallying by 150% and 200% , respectively. As we approach 2025 and a new big bull cycle, insiders question which of these meme coins will see the biggest gains over the coming weeks. While many have set their price targets for $PEPE and $BONK, Remittix (RTX) h5x as been identified as the next altcoin as it taps a much bigger market. Pepe (PEPE) Rebounds, Prepares for Massive Rally The frog-themed crypto, Pepe, felt the heat in the recent crypto market correction. CoinMarketCap’s data shows that the Pepe coin price dropped to $0.00001400 for the first time since November 5. However, the meme coin has rebounded, reclaiming the critical support level at $0.00001800. The futures open interest of $PEPE has also been growing steadily over the last few days, reaching a high of $151 million. The MVRV-Z score shows that the Pepe crypto is oversold and due for a massive price pump. Chandler Bing has reported that Pepe (PEPE) has formed a bullish megaphone pattern. If this pattern holds, the memecoin will clear its current ATH of $0.00002803. According to Chandler’s forecast, the Pepe price may cross $0.00006500 in 2025. If the rally extends it may peak at $0.0001, equaling the 2021 market cap of $SHIB. Analysts Share Optimistic Outlook for Bonk (BONK) The biggest Solana memecoin, Bonk (BONK) also took a huge hit during the recent market dip. From its ATH of $0.00005825, the Bonk coin has plunged by more than 40%, CoinMarketCap’s data shows. Though the outlook for $BONK is quite grim, analysts are still positive about the memecoin. According to a Bonk price chart shared by Frumza, the price of $BONK could increase by 135% over the next few weeks. The Bonk crypto price prediction showed that the price will hit $0.00007500 with a new all-time high. The prediction from Bluntz_Capital is similar but with a potential target of $0.0000700 in early 2025. By the end of this bull cycle, $BONK could delete another zero, meaning a rise of 210% from the current price. Why Analysts Believe Remittix (RTX) is the Next 100X Coin While the memecoins have led the market in 2024, analysts believe Remittix (RTX) could be the next big player in the DeFi space. Remittix has been getting a lot of interest because industry experts believe that its platform could be the major payment bridge foundation between crypto and fiat. Remittix is designed to reinvent the $190 trillion global cross-border payment market, promising users cheap, instant transfers, and transparency from anywhere in the world. The platform supports over 50 crypto pairs and 30+ fiat currencies, more than what the likes of Wise and Stripe offer. Remittix also integrated local payment networks into its platform, which allows users to instantly send fiat to any supported bank account. Remittix’s innovative platform could make it quickly become the standard for cross-border payments. With the $190 trillion market set to be reinvented by Remittix, the RTX coin is destined to be one of the biggest gainers of this bull cycle. With a current RTX coin price of $0.0156, analysts say that the altcoin price could shoot up by more than 100x before mid-2025. The Best Memecoin To Buy Now: BONK or Pepe? While Solana’s BONK outperformed $PEPE in 2024, this bull cycle will see Pepe record more gains. However, since the memecoin is past its era of explosive growth, the best crypto to buy in this bull cycle is RTX. The platform not only offers utility, but massive growth potential as it looks to reinvent a $190 trillion market.

TAO, FET, RENDER Plunge, But Lightchain AI Shows Promise",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/ai-crypto-winter-tao-fet-render-plunge-but-lightchain-ai-shows-promise,"The ongoing market correction has taken a toll on many AI-focused cryptocurrencies, with tokens like TAO, Fetch.ai (FET), and Render (RNDR) seeing significant price drops. However, Lightchain AI (LCAI) is breaking the mold with its innovative technology, clear roadmap, and a strong presale opportunity that’s catching the eye of investors. Join the Lightchain AI Presale today and secure your place in this promising project. Positioned as a disruptor in the blockchain and AI space, Lightchain AI is emerging as a sustainable alternative for those navigating the challenges of the crypto winter. TAO, FET, and RENDER Why Are They Struggling? The drop in TAO, Fetch.ai, and Render can be linked to some reasons. Worries about being too high in price have made a big impact, as lots of AI tokens went up a lot before this year, pushed more by excitement than by real use, which caused prices to go way up. Also, the market fill up has turned into a problem. Many AI-centered projects are getting in the area and making it harder to compete, which causes a drop of investor interest. Plus, even if these tokens offer hopeful ideas, their missing real-world uses have made it tough to explain their high market values͏. Even with their fresh traits, these plans are now having a hard time showing they can last. This has made room for newer and more sharp plans, like Lightchain AI, to pull in money backers. Why Lightchain AI Stands Out in the AI Crypto Space As the broader crypto market faces turbulence, Lightchain AI’s clear roadmap and early adoption opportunities position it as a strong contender for long-term success. With its presale price of just $0.0041, the token offers investors a low-risk entry point with the potential for exponential returns as the project progresses. Upcoming milestones, such as the January 2025 testnet launch and the March 2025 mainnet rollout, will further validate the platform’s capabilities and drive adoption. By focusing on practical utility and scalability, Lightchain AI is setting itself apart from competitors that rely solely on hype. So join presale today and secure your spot in Lightchain AI, the project that’s defying the AI crypto winter with its innovative approach and strong fundamentals. Don’t miss out on this opportunity to be part of a game-changing platform that is shaping the future of blockchain and artificial intelligence. How To buy Lightchain AI Tokens? To buy Lightchain AI (LCAI) tokens during the presale, set up a compatible wallet like MetaMask or Trust Wallet on the Ethereum (ERC-20) network. Fund your wallet with Ethereum (ETH), which you can purchase on exchanges like Coinbase or Binance and transfer to your wallet. ETH is needed for buying LCAI and covering transaction fees. Visit the official Lightchain AI presale website, connect your wallet, and use the dashboard to select your payment method (ETH or USDT) and enter the amount. Confirm the transaction in your wallet, and the LCAI tokens will be sent to you once processed. New users can also buy ETH with credit or debit cards via Ramp Network or MoonPay, then follow the same steps to complete their purchase. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

The IRS’s “broker” definition conflicts with SEC and CFTC regulations in crypto. Ripple CTO warns that users may turn to unsafe, anonymous DeFi platforms. The IRS’s finalization of the second half of its controversial broker rule marks a significant shift in the regulatory landscape for decentralized finance (DeFi). Jake Chervinsky, the CLO of Variant Fund, stated that by the start of 2027, the rule would require a lot of DeFi front-ends to enforce Know Your Customer (KYC) processes for their users. This decision has sparked outrage in the crypto community, with critics arguing that the rule is an overreach of governmental power. Further, they stated that it violates constitutional rights, posing a threat to innovation in the DeFi space.

While the premier cryptocurrency did make a play for the $100,000 mark on Christmas day, it didn’t take long for the bears to resume control. It was pretty much the same story for most of the other large-cap assets, including Ethereum, Solana, and the in-form XRP. The recent bearish climate of the crypto market has pushed a cloud of skepticism over the digital asset sector as the historic year 2024 draws to a close. Why Is Trading Activity Dwindling In The Market? In its latest post on the X platform, market intelligence firm Santiment shared an interesting insight into the crypto market in the final days of 2024. According to the blockchain company, market trading volume is steadily dropping across various cryptocurrency sectors. Data from Santiment shows that the trading volume is down by 64% in the past week, with sectors like AI/Big Data and meme coin reaching new weekly lows. This seems like a complete turnaround from a positive market trend considering that the price of Bitcoin only just set a new record high of $108,135 in the previous week. At the same time, Santiment believes that everyone should have anticipated the downturn of trading volume, especially that of speculative altcoins. “With the holidays here and traders getting their year-end finances in order, the final week of December is often one of the least active times of each year,” the analytics firm explained. Similarly, a Quicktake analyst with the pseudonym Grizzly mentioned that the Coinbase Premium Index, which tracks the percent difference between Coinbase Pro price (USD pair) and Binance price (USDT pair), has been on a decline due to similar reasons. Grizzly said reduced market participation during the holiday season, alongside limited cash flow, has likely contributed to the price decline. However, Santiment noted that the crypto market could see at least “one final big unexpected” rally before 2024 ends if whales continue to exhibit their strong accumulation tendency. This market pump could happen even with the current lack of retail attention and participation. Total Crypto Market Capitalization As of this writing, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization stands at around $3.43 trillion, reflecting a 2.2% decline in the past 24 hours. With the crypto market cap up by more than 100% year-to-date, there is no question that, regardless of how the year ends, 2024 has been an excellent period for the digital asset sector.",Crypto News|bitcoin|crypto|Santiment|Trading Volume,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|SEI|JUP|BSV|WLD|APE|HNT|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2024-12-28 13:30:55

Bitcoin (BTC) has dipped to trade at $94,000, and Ethereum (ETH) has fallen to the $3,300 range. Additionally, top altcoins exhibit bearish momentum, losing between 1% and 5% in the past 24 hours. Amid this cautious market, four Ethereum coins—Phala Network (PHA), Minotaurus (MTAUR), Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL), and DeXe (DEXE)—are showing remarkable potential to deliver significant returns. 4 Ethereum Coins Turning $100 to $1000 As December Comes to a Close Here are Ethereum-based tokens standing out in the bear market, earning investors substantial returns, as December ends, ushering in a new year. 1. Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL): Ethereum Coin Ring the AI Hype Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) has emerged as one of the top crypto gainers today, achieving a new all-time high of $3.58, before retracting to its current price of $3.44 after surging 15% in 24 hours. The Ethereum token has surged by 257.23% over the last month, propelled by the rapidly expanding AI and metaverse sectors. Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) price chart Expecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 45% in the AI agents industry, VIRTUAL’s incorporation of AI and Big Data is revolutionary. Key drivers of VIRTUAL’s success include: Binance listing: The coin’s price spiked after its listing on Binance, attracting significant whale interest. Metaverse integration: VIRTUAL leverages AI to create immersive digital experiences and generative AI applications. Technical outlook: The coin recently invalidated a bearish double-top pattern, breaking above $3.31 resistance. Analysts expect its bullish momentum to continue, with a potential target of $5 by 2025. Investors keen on cutting-edge AI and metaverse projects should consider VIRTUAL as a transformative opportunity. 2. Minotaurus (MTAUR): A Rising Star in Web3 Gaming Minotaurus (MTAUR) is gaining traction in the blockchain-powered gaming sector, as December comes to a closure. MTAUR tokens are attractively priced at 0.00006001 USDT in its current presale—a 70% reduction from the anticipated listing price of 0.00020 USDT, following an even lower initial price of 0.000040 USDT, demonstrating growth of over 200%. Minotaurus Tokenomics Designed for the Minotaurus game, MTAUR facilitates access to advanced features, offering referral-based incentives and vesting-linked benefits. Key highlights: Audited smart contracts : Verified by SolidProof and Coinsult, ensuring a secure and transparent ecosystem. Gaming industry growth: As Web3 gaming expands, MTAUR’s unique incentives make it a promising contender. With its strategic focus on gamification and community engagement, MTAUR is poised for long-term success, as an early-stage cryptocurrency . 3. Phala Network (PHA): AI Meets Blockchain Phala Network (PHA) is revolutionizing Web3 AI by integrating artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. It has rallied 245.08% over the past month to trade today at $0.5385, with significant momentum following its listing in Bitget’s Innovation Zone . Bitget’s promotional zero-fee trading offer and its reputation as a leading Web3 exchange have further fueled PHA’s rise. Phala Network (PHA) price chart Key innovations include: AI-agent contract: A groundbreaking feature enabling tamper-proof AI agents to interact with on-chain smart contracts. Developer tools: Advanced frameworks for creating decentralized, AI-driven applications. Phala Network’s emphasis on enhancing Web3 AI functionalities establishes it as a frontrunner in the industry, presenting an attractive opportunity for technology-oriented investors. 4. DeXe (DEXE): The Ethereum Coin is the Backbone of DAO Innovation DeXe (DEXE) is driving innovation in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). Its protocol fosters sustainable DAO growth by emphasizing meritocracy, incentive alignment, and expert participation. Governed by the DeXe DAO, the $DEXE token serves as its governance tool. Priced at $12.96, the token saw increased market activity with its 24-hour trading volume skyrocketing by 84.45% to $740.53 million. Key features: Meritocratic governance: A unique infrastructure designed for effective and scalable DAO operations. Increased participation: Active incentives encourage meaningful member contributions. With a year-to-date gain of 236.11%, DEXE is an attractive Ethereum token for investors interested in decentralized governance systems. Final Thoughts Despite the broader market’s bearish momentum, VIRTUAL, MTAUR, PHA, and DEXE offer exceptional potential for investors aiming to turn $100 into $1000. Their innovative approaches to AI, gaming, Web3, and DAOs set them apart as standout performers. With these Ethereum coins gaining traction, the holiday season might still bring festive returns for crypto enthusiasts.

An example of such a rival is Rexas Finance (RXS), which increased its value from $0.03 during the presale to $0.175 after raising more than 33 million dollars. Its new business model of integrating blockchain technology with real-world assets has made it a company being compared to Solana (SOL), a giant in the sector. But can RXS truly succeed Solana, and how high can it rise? Solana’s Legacy Based on the accepted understanding of global cryptocurrency networks, the Solana network’s competitive advantage lies in its market scalability and transaction speed, which are estimated to reach thousands of transactions per second. Its strong ecosystem, consisting of DeFi and NFTS, has allowed the creation of numerous decentralized applications. Rexas Finance (RXS) is carving a niche for itself rather quickly. Starting at just $0.03 and climbing to $0.175 during its presale, RXS raised more than $31 million. It brings innovations such as tokenizing real-world assets and creating NFTs via artificial intelligence, making the race for the best blockchain-friendly. Rexas Finance (RXS): Bridging Blockchain and Real-World Assets Rexas Finance differs from others by emphasizing the tokenization of real-world assets that integrate with conventional finance. RXS facilitates the digitization of real estate, among other types of assets, creating a new market for asset liquidity and fractional ownership. This strategy eliminates such restrictions and widens the target market to include those unaccustomed to the crypto space. Rexas Token Builder is one of the applications offered to users that do not require any technical know-how to create and manage their tokenized assets, which is an essential part of Rexas Finance’s ecosystem. It also supports budding companies via its Rexas Launchpad, advancing its ecosystem. In contrast to Solana, which is more exclusively for developers, Rexas Finance aims to include everyone and enable its blockchain technology to be used in various scenarios. Community Engagement and Security: Could Rexas Finance Outshine Solana? Solana’s (SOL) swift and inexpensive transactions have enabled it to foster a robust and devoted community of developers, creators, and investors. The community builds and interacts within its decentralized ecosystem. The Solana Foundation has also promoted community initiatives such as grants and partnerships to strengthen the ecosystem. However, this large community has experienced network outages, which raised questions about its security and reliability. On the other hand, Rexas Finance (RXS) completely emphasized community and security issues at the very onset of its downfall. After undergoing a stringent CertiK audit, the platform’s smart contracts have been fully sanctioned with no vulnerabilities. RXS also has a $1 million giveaway for the community to drive interaction through social networks. Twenty lucky winners can win 50,000 RXS tokens each by participating in referrals and completing activities. The giveaway results from these concentrated initiatives on security and community, and RXS will likely surpass Solana's legacy. The Case for Rexas Finance as Solana’s Successor Rexas Finance has penetrated the blockchain ecosystem and is showing itself as worthy of competition to Solana, which is known to be the prime factor in the industry. Solana’s history has provided it with some serious challenges regarding network reliability. Still, Rexas has promised stability thanks to its strong technology wrap-around and its target to solve real-world use cases, which are pretty appealing. Rexas Finance fuels its promises of being cost-efficient and stable, allowing it to stand out. With Rexas Finance looking to be revolutionary in the trillion-dollar real estate sector, Rexas’s growth looks exponential compared to Solana, which has a smaller market capitalization. Conclusion Rexas Finance shows that cryptocurrencies are just the tip of the iceberg regarding blockchain applications. In terms of market potential, this journey from $0.03 to $0.175 is massive and inspires confidence in investors. If the pace remains the same, along with strong fundamentals, it can grow to be one of the major players in the crypto space with the potential to compete with Solana. For Investors looking for newer, exciting opportunities in the scalable blockchain aspects, Rexas Finance is a chance to be involved in the more expected revolutionary shift.

While analysts predict Cardano’s (ADA) price to reach an impressive $3 due to its growing adoption, FXGuys is planning something even bigger for its investors. Experts have selected $FXG as the token to outperform in the market, but investors are asking what makes $FXG special over major players like Cardano’s ADA. Let’s find out! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Experts Forecast New Highs for Cardano, But Is ADA the Best Crypto to Invest in Now? Analyst Darren has claimed that Cardano has not yet shown its full potential in the crypto market. Darren noted that ADA is on the brink of a major breakout. This optimistic prediction is supported by ADA’s positive market sentiment and current momentum. Cardano’s ADA has shown strong price performance since November’s bull run. The ADA price jumped 154.5% from $0.33 on November 1, 2024, to $0.84 on November 20. By November 30, Cardano’s ADA extended further by 35.71% to $1.14. However, ADA lost momentum, dropping 7.89% to $1.05 just 16 days into December. Darren highlighted that the adoption of Cardano’s ADA will grow, suggesting a strong upward trajectory. The analyst noted that ADA’s price could propel toward $3 in the near term and that’s only the beginning. However, despite experts’ optimistic future predictions of ADA, investors seeking the best crypto coin to buy now are shifting focus to $FXG for maximized gains.

The dog-themed Solana-based coin has become one of the most recognized meme coins, with its market capitalization reaching $2.7 billion in May. Bonk (BONK) is a crypto token built on the Solana blockchain, much like DOGE, WIF, or SHIB. Bonk is a digital asset that can be traded on a number of online platforms, such as Binance, KuCoin, Kraken, MEXC, CoinEx, OKX, gate.io, and Bybit. Bonk has a maximum supply of 93 trillion. It is important to note that 66 trillion BONK are already in circulation. Interestingly, despite being a meme coin, Bonk’s supply is tied to its burning process to appreciate its value. The token became popular in 2022 after an airdrop to the Solana community. Despite its popularity and appeal, Bonk is highly volatile, and wild swings in its price action are routine. Along with being a meme coin, the Bonk ecosystem is far more diverse. Several projects built around Bonk also increase its utility prospects, which makes it a popular choice among traders and is also considered the primary trigger behind its 2024 bull run. Bonk Swap, Bonk Rewards, and Bonk BOT are the main features of the Bonk ecosystem.

Is Bonk a good investment? After its launch in December 2022, Bonk quickly gained traction. Being on the Solana blockchain triggered a huge surge in SOL’s price, attributed to Bonk’s unique distribution strategy. Bonk is a meme coin, but it has many side projects that contribute to its usability and make it more valuable than a mere dog meme coin. It is expected that by 2030, Bonk will reach $0.000292, which is approximately 15 times its current price, making it a good investment to consider. Why is Bonk down? Bonk lost a substantial portion of its value over the last 24 hours. In the last few hours, its value decreased by $0.000003145. Today’s decreasing pressure triggered a massive descent in the coin’s value. Will Bonk Recover? Bonk is currently trading in its middle price range. Considering the current situation, the coin’s price has initiated a recovery as the crypto pair has secured support at the $0.00001812 level. The recovery can continue as long as buyers remain consistent. Will Bonk reach $0.000055? Bonk’s strongest current resistance level is $0.0000255. However, just a few days ago, Bonk saw some price action above this level. Bonk may not break above this level in the short term, but according to market speculation, it will reach $0.000055 by mid-2026. Will Bonk reach $0.000100? Cryptopolitan’s Bonk price prediction suggests that the coin can reach $0.000100 and surpass it by 2028. When Bonk reaches this price level, its market capitalization will increase 4.5-fold. Will Bonk reach $1? According to Cryptopolitan’s price prediction, Bonk may not achieve the $1 level in the foreseeable future. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $1, which seems impossible as of now. Does Bonk have a good long-term Future? Bonk has garnered much attention from investors with its community-driven value. However, analysts do not share the same sentiment and are divided in their views on the crypto pair. This is true to an extent, as after its initial surge, sustaining the momentum has proved a challenge for Bonk. According to The Cryptopolitan’s review of the cryptocurrency, it is expected that Bonk will reach a maximum value of $0.000292 by the end of 2030, which is quite a bit above its current price.

Rollblock’s tamper-proof smart contracts, AI-driven games, and community-backed rewards are transforming online gaming with its revolutionary GambleFi platform powered by Ethereum. With over $7.7 million raised and RBLK tokens gaining in value, Rollblock is rapidly becoming the top crypto investment of 2025. This game-changing platform is turning heads with its potential for massive growth. Rollblock Positioning Itself to Be a Leader in the Gambling Market Rollblock (RBLK) is an online gambling platform that aims to disrupt the GameFi sector. It’s commitment to offering fair odds and providing robust security measures has been attracting a growing number of daily active users. The worldwide gambling industry is projected to grow from $540.3 billion in 2023 to $744.8 billion by 2028, with Rollblock positioning itself as a leader in the space. The platform combines gaming with earning via its community-backed casino and Play-to-Earn token. With an Ethereum-based ecosystem, 7,000 AI-powered games, token burns, staking rewards, and weekly dividends, Rollblock is reinventing online gambling. One of Rollblock’s standout features is its innovative buyback model. This system involves repurchasing RBLK tokens to support their value growth, which bolsters investor confidence and contributes to long-term stability. Investors have already shown significant interest, with Rollblock raising over $7.7 million and selling over 21 million RBLK tokens during its presale. At just $0.044 per token, early participants can take advantage of the opportunity before prices soar. Market enthusiasts think Rollblock might reach an all-time high on its current trajectory. Analysts Believe Tron (TRX) Can Hit $1 in 2025 Tron (TRX) is among the best altcoins operating. CoinMarketCap noted that the token was down 16.3% last week but gained roughly 25% over the previous thirty days. This remarkable month-long gain demonstrates Tron’s resilience and growth potential. The latest price surge has analysts paying rapt attention. BullishBanter, a well-known market expert, predicts TRX could rebound to $0.32 shortly. He believes surpassing this level might unlock significant upward momentum, pushing the token to even higher price points. Another analyst, EWT, shared an even more optimistic outlook. He forecasts that Tron could rally to $1 before the current market cycle ends. Tron’s technical indicators remain bullish. The relative strength index is above average and heading towards the overbought area, suggesting more upward pressure on the price. Binance Coin Faces Short-term Bearish Challenges Binance Coin (BNB) continues to showcase its market dominance. Recent technical analysis reveals that the price is steady at nearly $720, with strong support at $700. However, there are signs of bearish sentiment as whale activity declines, and futures open interest has dropped by nearly 50%, reaching $433 million. This lack of momentum could create short-term challenges for BNB. Regardless of these hurdles, analysts remain cautiously optimistic about BNB’s potential. They point to a symmetrical triangle breakout, which might drive the price to $850 (+ nearly 20%). However, BNB is under continuous regulatory scrutiny and competition from various other platforms, posing concerns regarding its long-term success. Though doubts regarding Binance’s future may harm BNB’s performance, the short-term outlook is encouraging. Rollblock’s Innovative Feature Attracts Tron and BNB Holders Rollblock’s ability to integrate advanced technology and provide tangible rewards sets it apart from competitors like Tron and Binance Coin, positioning it as a game-changer. The platform’s success, raising over $7.7 million, reflects its disruptive potential and growing appeal among investors. Rollblock is not just a gambling platform; it’s a transformative opportunity for those seeking innovation and long-term growth in the crypto market.

Prince Elon (ELONPRIN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONPRIN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Prince Elon can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Prince Elon could become the next viral memecoin. Prince Elon launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Prince Elon on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Prince Elon by entering its contract address – 7rAsmWGTtPFY9RFnhd9biard7PrWtw5ZigowwfmaXUQ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONPRIN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-28 13:54:11

The current downward momentum has sparked concerns among investors and analysts, with many questioning whether Bitcoin has reached its cycle top. Sentiment in the market has shifted dramatically, with fear replacing the once euphoric optimism that drove the cryptocurrency to recent highs. Related Reading: Chainlink Is Forming A Head-And-Shoulders Pattern – Confirmation Could Take LINK To $14 Despite the unease, crypto analyst Ali Martinez offers a more optimistic perspective on the situation. In a recent analysis shared on X, Martinez suggested that a 20% to 30% correction could actually be the most bullish outcome for Bitcoin at this stage. He highlights how such pullbacks have historically set the stage for stronger rallies by shaking out weaker hands and allowing the market to reset before resuming its upward trajectory. As Bitcoin’s price action teeters on the edge of a potential breakdown, all eyes are on the key support levels that could determine the next move. Will Bitcoin confirm the fears of a cycle top, or will a healthy correction provide the foundation for the next leg of its rally? The coming weeks will be crucial in shaping the narrative for the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Correction Looms Bitcoin appears on the verge of entering a critical correction phase, with the $92K level emerging as the line in the sand. Analysts and investors are increasingly concerned that a drop below this threshold—and potentially the $90K mark—could trigger a wave of selling pressure, driving the price into sub-$80K territory. The growing fear has cast a shadow over Bitcoin’s bullish narrative as many brace for potential downside risks.

Martinez offers a contrarian viewpoint, suggesting that a 20% to 30% correction could be the most bullish outcome for Bitcoin within the context of a bull trend. Martinez presented a compelling chart showcasing every Bitcoin correction exceeding 20% during past bull markets. His findings reveal that each of these corrections acted as a reset for the market, shaking out weaker hands and paving the way for stronger rallies. Martinez emphasizes that corrections are a natural and healthy component of Bitcoin’s price cycles, especially during bull runs. By allowing the market to recalibrate, they set the stage for sustained upward momentum. If Bitcoin does experience a significant pullback, it could be the precursor to a more robust and prolonged rally in the coming months. BTC Testing ‘The Last Line Of Defense’ Bitcoin is currently trading at $94,500, grappling with sustained selling pressure and bearish price action. The market sentiment has shifted significantly in recent days, with fears of a deeper retracement gaining traction among analysts and investors. Many believe that if Bitcoin loses the $92,000 mark, it could open the door for an accelerated decline. The $90,000 level is emerging as the critical support zone that Bitcoin must hold to maintain its bullish outlook. This level represents a psychological and technical barrier that could determine the cryptocurrency’s trajectory in the weeks ahead. If BTC manages to stay above $90K, analysts anticipate a strong recovery that could reignite bullish momentum and lead to a push toward previous highs.

A decisive break below the $90,000 level would likely exacerbate selling pressure, driving Bitcoin into deeper correction territory. In such a scenario, prices could fall as low as $75,000, marking a significant pullback from recent highs.

However, things have turned different this time, as Elisa Rossi has pulled the Solana co-founder, Stephen Akridge, in a significant Solana Controversy, including staking reward thefts and much more. Let’s discuss the whole story. Who is Elisa Rossi and Her Relation To Stephen Akridge? Elisa Rossi was married to Stephen Akridge for 10 years before the couple got separated in February 2023. The couple had quite a long journey together and grew rich and famous, especially with Stephen’s role in Solana, the third biggest blockchain network. At present, SOL price sits at $187 with a market capitalization of $89.4B. However, Akridge moved away from Solana Labs in January 2024 and has launched Anza. He is also the CEO of Cyber Grant, which is a cybersecurity company. The couple got divorced in early 2023 but are now in the limelight after Rossi sued Akridge. Rossi has openly called the divorce acrimonious and prolonged in a recent lawsuit. This Solana controversy highlighted the importance of understanding crypto distribution and management among spouses. Stephen Akridge’s Sued in Staking Reward Theft The Bloomberg report states that Rossi has sued her ex-husband, the Solana co-founder, for claims that Stephen used his crypto knowledge to steal millions of staking rewards from her portion of crypto. As a divorce settlement, Elisa Rossi received a significant portion of digital assets in three crypto wallets from her ex-husband, per Law.com . However, she had to file the lawsuit in San Francisco court after she realized that Stephen stole the staking commissions from her portion. The alleged crypto steal happened between March and May when Akridge still controlled her crypto accounts and stole the stalking commission for himself by directing her SOL to his control. Rossi claimed that she found out about this two months after the divorce and has reached out to him over a dozen times in the last few months, but he has failed to do so and even laughed in her face, saying, “Good luck getting those staking rewards from me,” per lawsuit filings. Overall, Rossi has sued Stephen Akridge for failing to adhere to divorce agreements, crypto theft, and fraud, and unfairly embezzling her money. With the Solana controversy and lawsuit, she wishes to receive compensation for the financial losses her husband has caused her. She also requests additional punitive or statutory exemplary damages and judgment interest per legal obligations. Does it Impact the Crypto Industry? Stephen Akridge’s lawsuit has gained significant attention from crypto enthusiasts, but it is a personal matter and does not really affect the performance of Solana or the crypto industry. However, this Solana controversy shows how people should have a decent knowledge of cryptocurrency and its functioning, considering its wide adoption and usage. In many cases, spouses like Elisa Rossi have faced similar crypto asset distribution issues due to unawareness. More importantly, in general, crypto scams have disturbed people’s lives.

This time, a phishing campaign centered around fake Zoom meeting links has left victims counting massive losses in cryptocurrency. Fake Zoom Invites Mask Malware A recent report by blockchain security firm SlowMist detailed a sophisticated phishing campaign targeting cryptocurrency users through fake Zoom meeting links. The attack has reportedly resulted in the theft of millions of digital assets. It involved the use of a fraudulent domain resembling the authentic one. This site mimicked the genuine Zoom interface to trick unassuming victims into downloading a malicious installation package. Once executed, the malware prompted users to enter their system passwords which enabled the collection of sensitive information such as KeyChain data, browser credentials, and cryptocurrency wallet details. Upon analysis, SlowMist said that it identified the malware’s code as a modified osascript script. The script extracted and encrypted user data before transmitting it to a hacker-controlled server flagged as malicious by threat intelligence platforms. The server’s IP address was traced to the Netherlands, and the attackers’ monitoring tools, including logs showing Russian script usage, suggest a connection to Russian-speaking operatives. On-chain tracking through SlowMist’s MistTrack tool revealed that the hackers’ primary wallet amassed over $1 million, converting stolen assets into 296 ETH. Further transfers led to a secondary address which is now linked to transactions across popular crypto exchanges such as Binance, Gate.io, and MEXC. A complex network of smaller wallets and flagged addresses, including those tagged “Angel Drainer” and “Pink Drainer,” facilitated fund dispersal. “These types of attacks often combine social engineering and Trojan techniques, making users vulnerable to exploitation. The SlowMist Security Team advises users to carefully verify meeting links before clicking, avoid executing unknown software and commands, install antivirus software, and update it regularly.” Phishing Scams Hit Alarming Highs There has been a surge in crypto phishing scams lately. Earlier this month, a fraudulent work meeting link sent via KakaoTalk caused a person to lose $300,000 in cryptocurrency. The malware-compromised funds were transferred to a BingX-associated wallet. The link installed malware and compromised Ethereum and Solana wallets. Another blockchain security expert, Scam Sniffer reported over $9.4 million was lost in phishing attacks in November alone. Malicious blockchain signatures remain a top threat, as scammers exploit fraudulent transaction permissions to drain wallets, including high-profile thefts exceeding $36 million.

Is There a Need to Panic? Here’s What to Know,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/what-is-the-latest-tether-usdt-fud-is-there-a-need-to-panic-heres-what-to-know/,"The European cryptocurrency market is set for a seismic change as the Crypto Asset Markets Regulation (MICAr) comes into full force on December 30, 2024. The delisting of Tether’s USDT from most centralized European exchanges is among the most significant changes that have stirred fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) in the market. Here’s what it means for crypto users, businesses, and the future of digital assets. MICAr stands for Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation. This comprehensive regulatory framework sets licensing requirements for cryptocurrency businesses in the European Union (EU), including “transitional rules” that facilitate compliance across EU member states. MICAr essentially creates a transparent environment for crypto activities by requiring Know Your Customer (KYC) processes for crypto transactions and wallets. While advocates see this as a step towards legitimacy of the market, critics argue that it could stifle innovation and invade privacy. MICAr is also expected to impact global crypto regulation, with the US and other countries likely to adopt similar rules in the near future. What Will Change Within the Scope of MICAr? Travel Rule Travel Rule, bir AB lisansı altında faaliyet gösteren kripto para işletmelerinin, boyutlarına bakılmaksızın tüm işlemler için hem gönderenlerin hem de alıcıların kimliklerini toplamasını ve paylaşmasını zorunlu kılacak. Bu kural aşağıdakiler için geçerlidir: Exchange transactions: Exchanges will share users' personal data during transfers. Hot and cold wallets: Even personal wallets should be tied to verified identities, giving authorities and exchanges full visibility of transactions. Critics argue that such extensive data collection increases the risk of privacy violations and data leaks. Related News: Veteran Analyst il Capo Reveals He's Buying More of This Altcoin After Today's Rally Tether (USDT) Delisting One of the most immediate impacts of MICAr is the delisting of Tether’s USDT, the world’s largest stablecoin by market cap. USDT will no longer be available on most centralized exchanges in Europe from December 30. While USDC (USD Coin) has been deemed compliant and will remain in use, the loss of USDT could disrupt trading pairs and liquidity. More stablecoins could follow, potentially reducing options for users in the EU. What Does This Mean for Users? Exchange-to-Exchange Transfers: Personal data will now accompany every transaction. This lack of anonymity raises concerns about where private information might go and how securely it will be handled. Hot and Cold Wallets: Tying wallets to identities undermines the privacy that crypto wallets have traditionally offered. Even offline wallets that do not provide direct on-ramps for fiat currency will face KYC requirements. MICAr advocates argue that tighter regulations will combat criminal activity like money laundering and tax evasion. But research shows that personal wallets do not significantly contribute to these risks because they do not involve fiat currency coming in and out. Critics argue that the measures disproportionately affect privacy-conscious users and set a worrying precedent for global crypto governance. *This is not investment advice.

Trump Cyborg (TRUMPCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCYB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Cyborg launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Cyborg on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Cyborg by entering its contract address – 9yaNQ89EaQ2nEDczZpuTZfDwfiYCxbwSYC4JeiWLDE57 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCYB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-28 14:36:00

As of today, December 28, 2024, WIF has begun experiencing upward momentum, with the price surge standing out notably compared to other assets. The significant price surge in WIF can be explained by the recent breakout of the descending price action pattern, interest from long-term holders, and the shift in market sentiment across the cryptocurrency landscape. Dogwifhat (WIF) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, WIF has not only broken out of a descending price action pattern but has also successfully retested its crucial support level of $1.80. This recent support for WIF is the third occurrence since November 2024. Source: Trading View WIF Price Prediction Based on historical price momentum, whenever the meme coin reaches this level, it experiences buying pressure and notable upside momentum. This time, experts and analysts anticipate a similar kind of upside momentum in the future. Based on the recent price action, if WIF successfully breaches the descending triangle price action pattern and closes a four-hour candle above the $1.945 mark, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 35% to reach the $2.65 mark in the future. WIF’s bullish thesis will only hold if it successfully breaches and closes a candle above the inclined trendline, otherwise, it may fail. $16 Million Worth of WIF Outflow Besides this bullish price action, investors and long-term holders have continuously been accumulating the tokens despite the price struggling to gain momentum, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Source: Coinglass Data from WIF spot inflow/outflow reveals that exchanges across the cryptocurrency landscape have witnessed an outflow of a significant $16 million in WIF meme coins. The term “outflow” refers to the movement of assets from exchanges to wallet addresses, which potentially indicates upside momentum and an ideal buying opportunity.

However, with increasing competition and market fluctuations, many are left wondering whether XRP’s next big move will solidify its place as a leading cryptocurrency or leave it playing catch-up. The possibility of XRP exploding by 1000% in 2025 is not mere speculation — it’s grounded in its unique use case and growing adoption. But in a market as dynamic as crypto, other players are stepping up, including innovative altcoins like BeerBear , which promise incredible returns and gamified ecosystems. Let’s explore why XRP and tokens like BeerBear could lead the charge in 2025. BeerBear: Smashing Scammers, Chugging Profits, and Bringing the Fun Back to Crypto!

XRP and BeerBear: The Future Titans of 2025? The narrative surrounding XRP and its potential 1000% explosion is built on real-world utility and institutional partnerships. As banks and payment providers continue to adopt XRP’s RippleNet, its demand is poised to skyrocket. However, newer players like BeerBear add a refreshing dimension to crypto investments. While XRP thrives on its role in the financial sector, BeerBear taps into the growing appeal of gamified ecosystems and community-driven platforms. The $BEAR token offers users an engaging way to earn, play, and invest, bridging the gap between fun and financial growth. This innovative approach makes BeerBear a strong contender for massive adoption, even as XRP remains a trusted stalwart. Both projects highlight a crucial trend in 2025: diversification. Investors no longer rely solely on established tokens like XRP but are increasingly drawn to innovative, high-growth opportunities like BeerBear. This shift reflects the evolving priorities of crypto users who want both stability and excitement. Conclusion As the crypto landscape evolves, XRP is undoubtedly one of the key players to watch. Its potential 1000% growth by 2025 could make it the biggest winner of the decade. However, the rise of innovative altcoins like BeerBear shows that the market’s future isn’t limited to traditional heavyweights. Whether you’re betting on XRP’s institutional adoption or BeerBear’s gamified community, one thing is clear: 2025 will be a defining year for crypto investments.

On Dec. 27, the National Bank of Cambodia issued a groundbreaking announcement that – for the first time – would permit commercial banks and payment firms to process Category 1 crypto assets. Examples of such assets include, but are not limited to, stablecoins like USDC and USDT, and CBDCs. Unbacked cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other decentralized tokens, remain strictly prohibited under the new regulations. This move marks an important, yet judicious step in how Cambodia is handling the phenomenon of cryptocurrencies in zeroing in on digital assets backed by fiat currency. Conditions for Service Providers Banks and payment firms must first get formal permission from the NBC before engaging in any crypto-related service offerings. The approved entities can cash or sell digital currencies in traditional ones, transfer cryptos between accounts, and offer custody services related to such assets. However, the NBC has set strict rules to protect the clients. For example, financial institutions are not allowed to use their clients’ crypto assets for their own financial gain. This is a protective measure against the misappropriation of assets and in conformity with international standards on crypto regulations. A Cautious Shift Toward Digital Assets Cambodia earlier had a blanket ban on all cryptocurrency-related transactions due to perceived extreme volatility and tendencies for unlawful use, including money laundering and fraud. The latest move softens that stance, but the country is treading carefully by focusing on regulated, fiat-backed digital currencies instead of speculative assets. Wider Implications Cambodia’s move to regulated crypto services is part of a global trend. The territories at the forefront of the effort to incorporate digital currencies into their financial systems include Hong Kong, the U.S., and the UAE. Still, Cambodia has only recently started down the path of adoption and regulation. Challenges to Adoption Despite this development, the regulatory framework of Cambodia has remained restrictive. The country was blocking 16 major crypto exchanges, including Binance, Coinbase, and OKX, earlier this month after those failed to secure licenses from its Securities and Exchange Regulator. Yet, Cambodian officials believe that digital currencies have a potential to contribute to strengthening the local currency-the Cambodian riel-and decreasing dependence on the U.S. dollar. This strategic approach has marked Cambodia’s intention to balance financial innovation with risk management and paved the way for further developments in its crypto ecosystem.",Blockchain|Regulation|Web3,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2024-12-28 15:14:00

However, recent volatility and growing competition from newer blockchains have led analysts to speculate about an impending ETH crash. While this might sound like bad news for Ethereum holders, it opens a golden opportunity for alternative investments, especially altcoins poised to capitalize on ETH’s potential decline. Among these altcoins are emerging projects with high growth potential, like BeerBear . With its unique utility, strong community, and gamified ecosystem, BeerBear is setting the stage for massive gains. Let’s explore why altcoins like BeerBear might be your best bet for a 500% ROI by 2025. BeerBear: Smashing Scammers, Chugging Profits, and Bringing the Fun Back to Crypto!

Why Altcoins Like BeerBear Stand Out in the Post-ETH Crash Era An ETH crash could usher in a redistribution of investment capital, with altcoins benefiting the most. Projects like BeerBear are particularly well-positioned to attract these funds, thanks to their community-first approach and focus on utility. BeerBear isn’t just a speculative asset— it’s a vibrant ecosystem offering staking rewards, gamified experiences, and tangible benefits like NFTs. This multifaceted approach appeals to both seasoned investors and crypto newcomers, ensuring strong adoption. With a tokenomics model designed to reward early adopters and sustain long-term growth, BeerBear is a prime candidate for exponential gains. The combination of accessible pricing, high rewards, and strong anti-scam initiatives sets BeerBear apart from traditional altcoins. Investors tired of empty promises from older projects are flocking to tokens with real value propositions, and BeerBear delivers exactly that. Conclusion As Ethereum navigates turbulent waters, altcoins are emerging as the shining stars of the crypto space. Projects like BeerBear, with their innovative ecosystems and commitment to community, are leading the charge. The potential for 500% or greater ROI by 2025 is no longer just a dream —it’s a very real possibility for those who recognize the opportunities in today’s market. With BeerBear’s presale heating up, now is the perfect time to make your move. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or a curious newcomer, the BeerBear ecosystem offers something for everyone.

The couple were married for 10 years before filing for divorce in 2023. However, Rossi has now filed legal claims that Akridge misappropriated “millions of dollars” in cryptocurrency. Allegations of Stolen Crypto Rewards According to the report , Rossi claims that the Solana co-founder stole “millions of dollars” from the gains from her digital wallet holdings of Solana (SOL). Notably, Akridge’s ex-wife accuses him of redirecting staking commissions from her holdings for his benefit. This is according to a complaint she filed at California Superior Court, San Francisco County. She alleged this happened between March and May 2023 after the couple filed for divorce in February. Rossi is now seeking damages for breach of contract and fraud, including undue enrichment. Akridge has been involved in other projects before co-founding Solana. He worked with Qualcomm Inc. as a principal engineer for the blockchain. Solana’s Historical Market Resurgence Solana has recorded interesting price development as it crashed from about $134 in 2022 to a low of $10 in the same year. The challenges resulted from the asset’s close association with now-disgraced Sam Bankman-Fried and his trading firm, Alameda Research. However, SOL has moved past that ugly incident and sits among the top 10 crypto assets by market capitalization. Solana’s market capitalization stands at over $89.73 billion as the asset continues to make waves in the crypto sector. As of this writing, SOL is trading at $186.43, a 2.12% decline in the last 24 hours. The asset has witnessed increased price fluctuation that saw it plunge to a low of $177 and a high of $201. As the coin battles this market volatility, its trading volume has declined significantly by 21.98% to $2.15 billion. Solana’s Growing DeFi Appeal The Solana network has recently become a major attraction in decentralized finance (DeFi). Many developers are shifting from Ethereum to Solana , and the network has over 7,600 new developers. This figure flips those on Ethereum, a development analyst expects to reflect in the price outlook soon.

At the forefront is BTFD Coin, which smashed through $4.6 million in its presale, drawing over 6,900 holders. Meanwhile, Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to reign supreme in the meme coin world, and Turbo (TURBO) is carving out a niche with its eco-friendly blockchain innovations. If you’re looking for the top crypto presales to buy, these three are worth a closer look. Meme coins have skyrocketed from quirky novelties to serious contenders in the cryptocurrency world. They’ve attracted massive communities, delivered jaw-dropping returns, and added a fun twist to investing. Enter BTFD Coin, which takes everything meme coins do best and amps it up with play-to-earn (P2E) games, staking rewards, and a powerful referral programme. With its thriving community and innovative features, it’s set to redefine the genre. And let’s not forget history’s lessons. Back in 1973, a global economic crash showed how market dips can be golden opportunities. Savvy investors know this, and BTFD’s name is a cheeky nod to that strategy. When chaos hits the market, it’s time to grab the dips—because those who do often come out on top. BTFD Coin: A Meme Coin Revolution in Progress It’s not every day you find a presale like BTFD Coin. This isn’t your run-of-the-mill meme coin; it’s a full-blown movement. With over $4.6 million raised in its presale, 60 billion coins sold, and 6,900 holders onboard, BTFD is already making waves. Currently in Stage 13, the price per coin is $0.000142. By the end of its presale, the listing price is expected to hit $0.0006, which has analysts buzzing with excitement. So, what’s driving all this hype? Utility. Unlike many meme coins that rely solely on community buzz, BTFD has tangible offerings. Its P2E game promises to engage users while rewarding them with BTFD tokens. The staking programme lets investors earn passively, and the referral system—complete with bonuses—is pulling in droves of new buyers. This is more than just a coin; it’s an ecosystem built for growth. Let’s run the numbers. Say you invest $35,000 in BTFD at the current presale price of $0.000142. That nets you approximately 246,478,873 BTFD coins. Once the price reaches $0.0006 post-presale, your investment could be worth a whopping $147,887. It’s no wonder people are flocking to this presale. Getting started is easy. Head to the presale page, connect your wallet, and don’t forget to use the bonus code BIG50 to snag an extra 50% in coins. With 16 stages total, the price rises at every step, so acting quickly could save you heaps. Dogecoin: The OG Meme Coin That Won’t Quit If there’s one coin that needs no introduction, it’s Dogecoin (DOGE). What started as a joke has become a household name, boasting one of the largest and most loyal communities in crypto. Over the years, DOGE has gone from tipping currency to a major player in the market, even earning endorsements from high-profile figures like Elon Musk. DOGE’s strength lies in its simplicity. It’s not trying to be the next Ethereum or Bitcoin. Instead, it’s carved out its own lane as a fun, lighthearted coin with massive community backing. That community power has proven to be a driving force behind its price surges, making it a reliable contender during bull runs. But Dogecoin isn’t just about memes anymore. It’s making strides in real-world adoption, with merchants worldwide accepting it for everything from coffee to Tesla accessories. Developers are also working on scaling improvements, ensuring DOGE remains relevant as blockchain technology evolves. It’s this blend of old-school charm and modern utility that keeps Dogecoin in the spotlight. For those looking at top crypto presales to buy, DOGE remains an anchor in the meme coin category. Its market resilience and widespread recognition make it a staple in many portfolios, proving that sometimes, the classics really are the best. Turbo: The Eco-Friendly Innovator in Crypto If you’re after something fresh and innovative, Turbo (TURBO) is one to watch. Turbo is shaking up the crypto space with its eco-friendly blockchain solutions, offering a sustainable alternative in an industry often criticised for its environmental impact. It’s a project that’s as forward-thinking as it is functional, combining cutting-edge tech with a commitment to sustainability. Turbo’s standout feature is its energy-efficient consensus mechanism. While traditional blockchains like Bitcoin rely on energy-intensive mining, Turbo uses a greener approach that drastically reduces its carbon footprint. This not only appeals to eco-conscious investors but also aligns with global efforts to combat climate change. The project’s utility doesn’t stop there. Turbo’s roadmap includes plans for decentralised finance (DeFi) applications, making it more than just an eco-friendly token. From staking to yield farming, Turbo is building an ecosystem designed to attract both retail and institutional investors. And let’s talk about its presale. Turbo’s launch has generated significant buzz, thanks to its unique value proposition and strong community engagement. It’s a fresh face in a crowded market, proving that innovation still has a place in crypto.

Leading the charge is BTFD Coin, whose presale performance has been nothing short of legendary, raising over $4.6 million and selling more than 60 billion coins across 6,900 holders. Meanwhile, Mog Coin (MOG) is luring in new investors with its viral appeal, and Baby Dogecoin (BABYDOGE) is levelling up with gaming features that have everyone talking. The cryptocurrency space hasn’t been this electric since Shiba Inu and SPX6900 redefined the culture. Over the years, meme coins have skyrocketed from being mere jokes to becoming a financial powerhouse. Think about Dogecoin’s massive surge or Shiba Inu’s entry into the top cryptos by market cap. These projects thrive on community power, viral campaigns, and real utility. Enter BTFD Coin — a project ready to revolutionise the meme coin space with its play-to-earn (P2E) game, staking rewards, and referral programme. Analysts say BTFD is primed to redefine the genre, giving investors another reason to buy the dips. With every market dip, savvy investors sniff out opportunities. History proves this, especially during events like the 1973 global economic crash. As chaos gripped the markets, those who bought the dips often emerged wealthier. BTFD Coin embraces this spirit, blending meme culture with economic smarts, ensuring it’s not just a coin but a movement. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Movement Redefining Value If you’ve been watching the crypto presale scene, you’ve probably already heard of BTFD Coin. It’s not just riding the meme wave; it’s making waves of its own. With a name that cheekily nods to the famous trading mantra “buy the f****** dip,” BTFD isn’t just about humour; it’s about strategy. The presale has been flying off the shelves, crossing $4.6 million and selling over 60 billion coins to 6,900 eager investors. Currently, in Stage 13, the price per coin is $0.000142, with analysts predicting a post-presale listing price of $0.0006. Here’s why BTFD is the talk of the town. It’s not just another meme coin. It comes with real utility, including a highly anticipated P2E game, where players can earn rewards in BTFD tokens. Add to that the staking programme, where holders can grow their portfolios passively, and a referral system that rewards users for bringing in their mates. The buzz is justified. Think about this: if you invested $35,000 at the current presale price of $0.000142, you’d snag around 246,478,873 BTFD coins. Once the price hits $0.0006 post-presale, your investment would balloon to $147,887. Talk about a cheeky return on investment! With 16 stages in the presale, each stage sees a price hike. Early birds are clearly the winners here. And don’t forget the bonus code BIG50, which gifts you 50% extra coins when used. To join the BTFD revolution, head to the presale page , connect your wallet, apply the code, and lock in your purchase before prices climb higher. Mog Coin (MOG): A Viral Sensation with Real Staying Power Next up is Mog Coin (MOG), a project that’s capitalising on the meme coin formula with a fresh twist. Born out of internet culture, MOG leans heavily into its community’s strength, driving its value with viral campaigns and grassroots support. It’s the kind of coin that thrives on memes, tweets, and TikTok videos—a perfect recipe for the Gen Z and Millennial crowd. Mog Coin’s primary appeal is its relatability. With its cat-themed branding and no-nonsense vibe, it’s both accessible and endearing. It’s a reminder that crypto doesn’t always have to be overly technical or serious. However, what’s serious is MOG’s potential. With increasing listings on centralised exchanges and growing social media hype, analysts believe MOG is poised for a significant breakout. What sets Mog Coin apart is its unwavering commitment to community-driven growth. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies that rely on large institutions or foundations, MOG thrives on its fans’ collective power. It’s proof that a shared vision and some cheeky memes can go a long way in the crypto world. Investors who got in early are already seeing substantial returns, but the project’s roadmap suggests there’s plenty of room to grow. From partnerships with influencers to charity initiatives supporting animal welfare, MOG is more than just a flash in the pan. It’s building a brand that could stand the test of time. Baby Dogecoin (BABYDOGE): Where Memes Meet Gaming Baby Dogecoin (BABYDOGE) has been a fan favourite since its launch, but it’s the recent pivot to gaming that’s got everyone’s attention. BABYDOGE is already well-known for its charitable efforts and strong community backing, but its entry into the gaming space marks a new chapter. The BABYDOGE gaming ecosystem aims to attract players and investors alike. By integrating play-to-earn mechanics, Baby Dogecoin has created a platform where users can have fun while earning rewards. This shift not only broadens its appeal but also adds real-world utility to a coin initially known for its meme value. Another standout feature is BABYDOGE’s deflationary model. With every transaction, a percentage of tokens are burned, reducing supply and potentially increasing value over time. It’s a smart strategy that rewards long-term holders and creates a sense of exclusivity. But it’s not all about tech and utility. Baby Dogecoin remains true to its meme roots, with campaigns that tug at heartstrings and tickle funny bones. The gaming move is just another way the coin is staying ahead in a highly competitive market. Whether you’re in it for the laughs or the gains, BABYDOGE offers something for everyone. How to Join the BTFD Coin Presale Investing in BTFD Coin is a breeze. Here’s the process: Go to the Presale Page: Visit https://www.btfd.io/buy-now/ .

Both have earned their place in the memecoin hall of fame, with DOGE gaining early fame as the “people’s cryptocurrency” and SHIB proving the power of community-driven projects. But as we look toward 2025, the question remains: Which of these tokens has the potential to break the $0.01 barrier and emerge as the dominant memecoin? While SHIB and DOGE may dominate headlines, a new wave of meme tokens like BEERBEAR is challenging these established players with a mix of innovation, gamification, and rewarding ecosystems. Let’s dive into why these tokens might be the dark horses in the race to $0.01. BeerBear: Smashing Scammers, Chugging Profits, and Bringing the Fun Back to Crypto!

Can SHIB or DOGE Maintain Their Relevance? Both SHIB and DOGE have unique advantages. DOGE remains a cultural icon with mainstream appeal and endorsements from influential figures. Meanwhile, SHIB has leveraged its robust ecosystem, including its ShibaSwap platform and planned metaverse expansions. However, as the memecoin space becomes more competitive, their path to $0.01 is far from guaranteed. Newer tokens like BEERBEAR are capitalizing on the gaps left by legacy memecoins, offering tangible utilities, gamification, and community-driven innovation. BEERBEAR, with its emphasis on fighting scammers and rewarding holders, demonstrates how modern memecoins can evolve beyond hype to build sustainable ecosystems. This blend of fun, functionality, and financial opportunity could position it as a strong contender to dominate the market in the coming years. Conclusion The race to $0.01 is more than just a number — it represents the growing maturity and potential of memecoins in the broader crypto market. While SHIB and DOGE have laid the foundation, emerging players like BEERBEAR are redefining what’s possible in the space. For investors looking to ride the next wave of innovation, BEERBEAR offers a refreshing alternative with its unique gamified ecosystem and commitment to transparency. As 2025 approaches, the memecoin battle is set to intensify, and BEERBEAR might just be the underdog that surprises everyone.

The agency says it will be sending the funds by the end of the month to eligible individuals who did not claim the Recovery Rebate Credit, a refundable credit for taxpayers who did not get coronavirus-related stimulus payments on their 2021 tax returns. According to the IRS, some of the eligible Americans will receive up to $1,400. “No action is needed for eligible taxpayers to receive these payments, which will go out automatically in December and should arrive in most cases by late January 2025. The payments will be automatically direct-deposited or sent by paper check; eligible taxpayers will also receive a separate letter notifying them of the payment.” IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel says the federal agency’s internal data shows that one million taxpayers “overlooked claiming” the Recovery Rebate Credit even though they were eligible. “To minimize headaches and get this money to eligible taxpayers, we’re making these payments automatic, meaning these people will not be required to go through the extensive process of filing an amended return to receive it.” Americans who haven’t filed their 2021 tax returns will also be eligible for a share of the $2.4 billion if they file the same by April 15th of 2025. “Qualified taxpayers are those who filed a 2021 tax return, but where the data field for the Recovery Rebate Credit was left blank or was filled out as $0 when the taxpayer was actually eligible for the credit.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

This bearish trend has impacted several altcoins, leading to substantial sell-offs. Here are three altcoins to sell now to avoid massive losses in January 2025, as they respond to current market dynamics. Altcoins To Sell : Bitget Token (BGB) Bitget Token (BGB) serves as the primary utility token for the Bitget crypto exchange. Launched in July 2021, BGB enables platform users to pay for services, stake for rewards, participate in social trading, and receive discounts on transaction fees. Holders of BGB can also engage with the exchange’s launchpad and launchpool initiatives. To maintain a deflationary supply, Bitget has instituted a quarterly token burn strategy. This involves buying back BGB tokens and permanently removing them from circulation. After a massive surge over the past two days, the Bitget Token has decreased to $7.54, reflecting a 10% drop over the past 24 hours. This price trend suggests that BGB could be among the top three altcoins to sell now to avoid potential significant losses by January 2025. TL;DR of the updated #BGB Whitepaper: Deflationary Supply with BGB buybacks & burn plan Expanding Utilities: More BGB use cases on-chain and off-chain PayFi Services: Use BGB with Bitget pay & cards for payments Learn more: https://t.co/HcrZJUmYLf — Bitget (@bitgetglobal) December 27, 2024 Helium (HNT) Helium (HNT) operates a decentralized blockchain network specifically designed for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Since its mainnet launch in July 2019, the network enables low-powered devices to connect and transmit data through its widespread nodes. Currently, the price of Helium stands at $6.46, experiencing a 7% decrease in the last 24 hours. This week, HNT’s value has dropped by 10%. Should this downward trend continue, Helium’s price might fall to $4. This positions it as one of the top three altcoins that could be advisable to sell. Source: TradingView FTX Token (FTT) FTX Token (FTT) serves as the principal digital currency for the FTX cryptocurrency derivatives exchange, which began operations on May 8, 2019. T entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States on November 11, 2022, with legal processes still active. It is crucial to exercise caution when dealing with the FTT token, as the current status of FTX may not be stable. Recently, the value of FTT has fallen, positioning it as one of today’s significant decliners on CoinMarketCap. As of today, the price of FTT has dropped to $3.26, reflecting a 6.33% decrease over the past 24 hours. In conclusion, as the crypto market experiences continued volatility, selling specific altcoins could be wise. These adjustments are crucial to prevent potential financial strain, reflecting the broader negative sentiment within the crypto industry.

Ethereum (ETH) is poised to surge to an astonishing $5,000, while WallitIQ (WLTQ) aims for an extraordinary rally of 77,000% by the start of 2025. WallitIQ (WLTQ): The Next Big Thing In Crypto Wallets Set For 77,000% Surge By January 2025 WallitIQ (WLTQ) is the star of the crypto wallet space, gearing up for an unprecedented 77,000% surge by January 1, 2025. The ongoing presale is breaking records, attracting thousands of investors eager to secure their spot in this game-changing project. With over 95% of presale tokens already sold, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is proving its ability to dominate the multi-billion crypto wallet and AI market. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) AI-driven features, like real-time threat detection and advanced encryption, position it as the most secure and user-friendly wallet on the market. Investors are flocking to the presale, drawn by the opportunity to buy WallitIQ (WLTQ) tokens at a fraction of their projected value. Ethereum whales have taken notice, investing heavily to ensure WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) success. The presale’s momentum is staggering, with expectations of a complete sellout in just a few weeks. Early participants are poised to reap massive returns even before the increase in the next round. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) innovative features, combined with strong community backing, create an irresistible investment opportunity. Furthermore, the platform prioritizes security with its Escrow Connect feature, which evaluates potential risks during interactions with decentralized applications (dApps). This additional safety feature offers users greater assurance as they engage with the dynamic cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Also, WallitIQ (WLTQ) introduces an innovative Physical 2 Digital (P2D) wallet functionality, enabling users to effortlessly convert physical assets into digital tokens. Its recent listing on CoinMarketCap has further improved its credibility and trustworthiness, increasing user confidence in the platform's authenticity and performance. WallitIQ (WLTQ), priced at $0.0243, is gaining attention as Ethereum whales are predicted to push Ethereum (ETH) to $5,000 by January 1, 2025. With its attractive staking rewards offering an annual percentage yield (APY) of up to 180% and potential for a 77,000% rally, WallitIQ (WLTQ) stands out as a promising investment in the crypto market. Ethereum (ETH): Whales Driving ETH Price To $5,000 Ethereum whales are making bold moves in anticipation of Ethereum’s (ETH) meteoric rise to $5,000. These influential players continue to accumulate Ethereum (ETH), capitalizing on its role as the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). With Ethereum’s (ETH) upcoming scalability upgrades and enhanced utility, whales are reinforcing their dominance by amassing more tokens. Ethereum whales are instrumental in driving liquidity, often using their holdings to influence market sentiment. Their strategic accumulation aligns with increasing adoption across sectors such as gaming, real estate, and supply chain management. Analysts predict that Ethereum’s (ETH) growing ecosystem, fueled by these whales, will solidify its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The involvement of Ethereum whales in staking and liquidity pools further amplifies Ethereum’s (ETH) value proposition. As staking rewards grow and decentralized applications thrive, Ethereum’s (ETH) utility expands, making the $5,000 target not just a dream but an achievable reality. The time to align with these strategic investors is now as they steer the Ethereum (ETH) rally. Conclusion Ethereum (ETH) and WallitIQ (WLTQ) are paving the way for groundbreaking achievements in the cryptocurrency landscape. Ethereum whales are preparing for a $5,000 price surge, while WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) presale success points to a jaw-dropping 77,000% rally. These milestones are not mere speculation but informed predictions based on market trends and technological advancements. Now is the time to act.

Despite this downturn, SOL's six-month change remains a positive 36%. Technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index at around 32 and Stochastic near 10 suggest that SOL may be oversold. The nearest support level is at $141, and if the price holds above this, it could rebound toward resistance levels at $249 and potentially $302. This possible upward movement represents a significant percentage increase.

This came as the analyst revealed his target projections for XRP by March 2025, which coincidentally falls within this timeframe. XRP Price Could Rise In The Next 90 Days The XRP price could rise in the next 90 days based on Egrag Crypto’s recent prediction. The analyst predicts that XRP could rally to $6.4 by March 2025. He made this bullish projection based on a Linear Regression Channel, which he highlighted on the chart. This Linear Regression creates a channel around the trendline that captures approximately 68% of price movements. In line with this, the analyst stated that XRP is projected to reach the top end of the Regression Channel at approximately $6.4 by March 2025 or earlier. Egrag Crypto noted that this price surge aligns with Fib 1.618 for strong confluence. Furthermore, the analyst predicts that there could be a potential overshoot. He remarked that a breakout above the Regression Channel could push XRP to around $8..5. This rally to $8.5 corresponds with Fib 1.272 , signaling extended bullish momentum. Egrag Crypto also discussed the intermediate target, noting that $4.4 is an important milestone as it is tied to the Fib 1.414. Meanwhile, as to what could represent the cycle blow-off top, the crypto analyst opined that any target between Fib 1.414 and 1.618 would represent the blow-off top of this cycle. This means that the XRP price could top between $13 and $27. Egrag Crypto recently explained that XRP could reach the $27 price target. considering that the crypto experienced a greater price explosion in the 2017 bull run. Therefore, the crypto analyst is confident that XRP can record a fraction of the 2017 gains. The Rally Could Extend To May The XRP price rally could extend to May based on another analysis by Egrag Crypto. In an X post , the crypto raised the possibility of XRP reaching $15 by May 2025. The analyst explained that the Fibonacci 1.618 suggests that May 5th could be a pivotal date for XRP. While whether XRP reaches this target remains is unknown, the crypto analyst remarked that the trend-based Fib time is pointing in this direction. This rally to $15 could happen on the wave 5 impulsive move which Egrag Crypto stated typically ranges between 1.236% to 1.618% of Wave 4, ot it can equal Wave 1 or 61.8% of Waves 1 and 3. If so, that means the XRP price could enjoy a surge of over 300%, which could send it to around $15. While there is such a bullish outlook for XRP, a recent CoinGape market analysis highlighted five reasons why the crypto is still at risk of crashing to $1 . These reasons include Bitcoin’s weakness and bearish indicators. XRP’s network activity and daily active addresses have plummeted while Whales are also offloading their coins, which could put significant selling pressure on XRP.

Ethereum takes center stage as investors speculate about a potential break out for ETH, with the goal to smash $4000. Behind this optimism is the speculation that Ethereum’s resurgence could trigger the long-awaited altseason, potentially leading to widespread gains for the entire altcoin market. Meanwhile, a young altcoin shares the crypto spotlight as it presents its groundbreaking zero-gas technology and innovative Web3 utilities: JetBolt (JBOLT). Beyond expectations, its presale has soared over 200 million tokens sold since launch. As JetBolt gains strength amidst market uncertainties, can Ethereum rise to the challenge to hit $4000? Let’s dive into the dynamics and thrilling developments surrounding Ethereum alongside JetBolt’s growing popularity and adoption. Ethereum: Could ETH smash $4000? Ethereum (ETH) is trading as of press time at $3,367.95. With a market cap of over $400 billion, ETH continues to hold the second spot in the list of cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, and is still the world’s second-most famous blockchain network, next to Bitcoin. Ethereum’s Price chart courtesy of Trading View Like most cryptocurrencies, Ethereum suffered major declines when the U.S. Federal Reserve cut rates and as the market slumped post-Christmas. ETH’s price is down by 4.48% over the past two days, and still more than 30% away from its all-time high of $4,800 achieved in November 2021. On the flipside, Ethereum has posted a year-to-date growth of over 50%, sparking analysts to remain optimistic about the future of the asset. Top analyst Carl Runefelt recently discussed ETH’s formation of a symmetrical triangle pattern in the four-hour timeframe, a classic indication of a breakout. He said that Ethereum must break upward from the triangle formation to breach the $3,980 bullish target. But Ethereum faces resistance at the $3,550 level, a critical price point analysts and investors are eager for ETH to surpass, reflecting renewed bullish momentum. Ethereum’s derivatives maintained levels the same as last week, with monthly contracts trading with an 11% premium over the spot market, slightly above the 5%-10% neutral range. Ethereum’s total value locked (TVL) has held steady at around 20 million ETH over the past two weeks, highlighting its resilience. While ETH maxis remain optimistic about its breakout, with positive derivatives and on-chain metrics, hitting $4000 will also depend on the macro economic performance, and how Ethereum could defend or break the $3,550 critical level. JetBolt: Gaining ground with zero-gas innovation and Web3 utilities Navigating through the crypto labyrinth of waves and tides, the young altcoin JetBolt (JBOLT) continues to gain traction, with a growing popularity and market appeal fueled by its cutting-edge technologies and utility-driven solutions. Leveraging the Skale Network, JetBolt offers zero-gas technology, a defining feature that eliminates the barrier of gas fees. Everyday users and developers no longer need to worry about hefty gas costs, enhancing blockchain’s appeal to a wider range of audience. JetBolt offers an AI-driven aggregation tool that delivers crypto news and market development updates. In addition, JetBolt’s user-friendly Web3 wallet makes entry simple and smooth, using advanced features like WebAuthN and facial recognition. There are also enticing incentives that await early buyers, including daily price increases and special offers that grant up to 25% more tokens, when they avail of the Alpha Boxes or JBOLT token bundle deals. Despite being a new player, JetBolt is rapidly making its mark in the crypto space, offering its unique blend of technology-powered features and real-world usability. With such appealing advantages, JetBolt is gaining ground as one of the top altcoins to watch in 2025. Final Thoughts: Could ETH Smash $4000 as Jetbolt Gains Strength? Supported by positive derivative markets and strong on-chain metrics, Ethereum reaching the $4000 mark may be possible in the long term. Key factors such as the broader global economy and Ethereum ecosystem’s ability to defend or break key resistance levels, will play significant roles. Meanwhile, JetBolt’s technology-powered features and utility-driven innovations continue to showcase its strength, driving its rapid ascent. With focus on enhancing blockchain users’ experience, JetBolt is solidifying its position as one of the stand out altcoins for 2025, alongside established players like Ethereum.

Going down the memory lane, he used the maneuver the US made in dealing with calls for a gold standard to buttress his points. He believes should the US economy continue growing, there might be a shift in Donald Trump’s stance regarding Bitcoin. Bitcoin Strategic Reserve: The Feasibility According to Ki Young Ju, economists like like Peter Schiff championed the quest for a return to the gold standard in the 1990s. He compared the advocacy at the time to the clamor by Bitcoin proponents for the strategic reserve as we have today. While the prospects of a gold standard looked appealing at the time, the CryptoQuant CEO said the US have always devised a means to avoid such shifts. Today, he highlighted how the push for gold standard is now a thing of the past. Meanwhile, Ki Young Ju is not dismissing the possibility of a Bitcoin purchase by the US, he believes the scope will differ from what advocates envisage. Throughout history, whenever the United States perceived a threat to its dominance in the global economy, gold prices surged, and debates around the gold standard gained traction. In the late 1990s, Peter Schiff championed gold as the true form of money, much like today’s… — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) December 28, 2024 At the moment, a crypto advisory council is being convened to help guide on the possibilities of this reserve. However, the CryptoQuant CEO said as the US economy matures, the urgency to hedge the US Dollar with Bitcoin might not be there. Big Bitcoin Bets, Countries Turning Their Backs Amid the push by countries like the United States, Bhutan and El Salvador for a strategic Bitcoin Reserve, nations like Japan have shown how unreceptive they are to the idea. As reported earlier by Coingape, Japan has rejected the BTC national reserve idea as it plans to focus on building its economy’s stability. Advocates of the Bitcoin reserve plans suggests it could drive a massive capital network, one that can help resolve mounting debts. While countries have continued to lag in pushing for the adoption, private and publicly traded firms have started running with the idea. Firms like MicroStrategy, MARA Holdings, Metaplanet and RIOT Platforms have continued to buy Bitcoin at a consistent rate over the past few months. Of the lastest purchases, Metaplanet bought 619.7 Bitcoin worth ¥9.5 billion, taking its total holdings to 1,761.98 BTC.

Table of Contents XRP price battles market turmoil: Will the $2.20 support hold amid fed-induced sell-off? PropiChain’s ascendancy in the real estate sector Why PropiChain is the perfect investment The recent decline in XRP price has caused significant liquidations as there were bullish sentiments surrounding the asset since November. As the XRP price struggles to maintain its foothold, PropiChain (PCHAIN) emerges as a beacon of invention, using AI to transform the real estate sector. While the XRP price faces bearish sentiment and market fluctuations, PropiChain gradually gains momentum with its unique offerings that promise to redefine property investment. XRP price battles market turmoil: Will the $2.20 support hold amid fed-induced sell-off? The XRP price has sharply declined amid a broader cryptocurrency market sell-off. The asset is around the $2.20 support level, reflecting an 8% drop over the past week. This price drop is part of a larger market downturn, which saw the total market capitalization fall to $3.3 trillion, its lowest in a month. Bitcoin ‘s slide below $94,000 and Ethereum’s retreat to $3,300 have intensified bearish sentiment across all major altcoins, including XRP. The Federal Reserve’s recent hawkish policy stance, emphasizing fewer interest rate cuts in 2025, triggered this significant market reaction. Tightening global liquidity and rising bond market volatility have further compounded the sell-off. Despite these challenges, the psychological support of $2.00 for the XRP price remains a key level to watch. Investors continue to weigh macroeconomic pressures against potential long-term gains, reflecting the delicate balance in the current crypto landscape. PropiChain’s ascendancy in the real estate sector While the XRP price faces these challenges, PropiChain is making significant strides in the real estate industry by using blockchain and AI technologies. PropiChain aims to democratize access to the global real estate market, valued at over $300 trillion, by enabling fractional ownership through asset tokenization. PropiChain is a unique project, blending blockchain technology, AI, and NFTs to redefine property ownership and real estate management. Designed to address traditional real estate market inefficiencies, the platform eliminates barriers such as high entry costs, lengthy processes, and fraud risks. At the core of PropiChain’s value proposition lies its use of NFTs for fractional property ownership. By converting physical real estate into digital assets, PropiChain democratizes access to property investments. Investors can own fractions of high-value properties, trade their shares with ease, and diversify portfolios. This NFT-based system also guarantees transparency and security through blockchain technology, removing the need for cumbersome paperwork and intermediaries. PropiChain’s integration of AI improves the platform’s efficiency. Advanced predictive analytics give users actionable insights into market trends, property valuations, and optimal investment strategies. For instance, investors can automate transactions based on specific conditions, such as purchasing property when its value reaches a target price. This level of automation minimizes human error, reduces transaction costs, and accelerates deal execution. Beyond its core offerings, PropiChain integrates with the Metaverse to introduce a virtual property exploration experience. The Propiverse feature allows users to take immersive 3D property tours, eliminating geographical barriers and providing a comprehensive understanding of property attributes. PropiChain further simplifies property management with smart contracts. Lease agreements, rental payments, and renewals can all be automated, reducing administrative burdens and ensuring transparency. Tenants can automate rent payments while landlords receive funds instantly, eliminating delays from traditional banking systems. Security is another key pillar of PropiChain’s ecosystem. Every transaction is recorded on a decentralized ledger known as a Title Contract, ensuring tamper-proof and verifiable records. This transparency mitigates fraud risks and provides a level of trust unparalleled in the legacy real estate industry. PropiChain’s native token, PCHAIN, plays a central role in its ecosystem. It grants access to the platform’s features, including property NFTs, AI-driven insights, and DeFi applications. Early investors are well-positioned to gain significant returns, with projections indicating over 800% ROI for initial buyers. Additionally, PCHAIN tokens can be used as collateral for liquidity through decentralized finance, allowing investors to unlock the value of their assets without selling them. Why PropiChain is the perfect investment PropiChain’s native token, PCHAIN, is currently in its presale phase and has garnered significant interest from the investment community. Since listing on CoinMarketCap, the presale has surpassed the $2 million milestone, showcasing growing confidence in the platform’s potential​. Investors participating in the presale can acquire PCHAIN tokens at a discounted rate of $0.011 per token. This early participation provides a chance for substantial financial returns as the token listing is anticipated to be at $0.32, translating to over 800%​. Analysts have projected remarkable growth for PCHAIN, with some estimates suggesting that an initial $1,000 investment could grow to $80,000 by mid-2025. This represents a potential 8,000% return on investment, further underlining the token’s appeal to retail and institutional investors​. While the XRP price movement to resurgence may take some time, savvy investors have started hedging their bets in PropiChain for unmatched ROI. Take this early opportunity and invest in the next big thing in crypto. For more information about the PropiChain presale, visit the official website and join the online community.

In a new video, Pizzino tells his 345,000 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin is likely to stay below the record high of around $108,200 for more than one week but not for more than half a year. According to Pizzino, the longer Bitcoin consolidates below the all-time high, the stronger the upward move that could follow will be. “I don’t think we’re in the midst of something like six months underneath that top [of around $108,200]. What we do expect is a longer period of time under the top, not more than six months, but longer than what we have currently seen. And what we have currently seen is 13 days underneath that top.” The widely followed analyst says Bitcoin could start breaking out from under the current all-time high beginning in the early weeks of the first quarter of 2025. “ So somewhere around that inauguration [of President-elect Donald Trump on January 20th, 2025]. So that might be some of those reasons that people get really excited as to why this thing should go up from that point. You know Trump’s in and then they start to get a little bit excited and the cycle sort of rinses and repeats and we get a nice upside. If that is the case, that’s going to be a good move or at least a good amount of time underneath this top [of $108,200] especially as we have broken out into a new fresh all-time high… Basically call it January for some sort of low and then potential breakout to a new fresh high which might come in late January or into February. So that’s the big thing that I’m looking out for quarter one [of 2025].” Source: Jason Pizzino/YouTube Bitcoin is trading at $94,528, about 13% below the all-time high, at time of writing. ?

Homosexual Pepe (HOMOPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homosexual Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homosexual Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Homosexual Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homosexual Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homosexual Pepe by entering its contract address – 92xPeBxtanptFH9AYsRtwRMq7cWWw9GHfxaspwpNvCTP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOPEPE.

DOGEN Rejoys Big Moment: Trump’s Victory Will Send It to the Moon Guess who is going to join Elon Musk’s moon mission soon?

Flex Hard, Earn Big – DOGEN is Your Power Move! Dogecoin: From Meme to Major Cryptocurrency Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency that began in 2013 as a light-hearted alternative to traditional coins, featuring a Shiba Inu dog as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a capped supply, Dogecoin has no maximum limit, and 10,000 new coins are mined every minute. In 2021, its value soared, boosted by social media and endorsements from figures like Elon Musk, making it one of the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The coin's abundant supply and active community have made it popular for small transactions and tipping online. In the current market cycle, Dogecoin continues to draw interest due to its strong community support and high visibility in the crypto space. Shiba Inu (SHIB): An Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Growing Utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency inspired by Dogecoin but operates on the Ethereum blockchain, enhancing its compatibility with the Ethereum ecosystem. Launched in August 2020 by the anonymous developer Ryoshi, SHIB began with a supply of 1 quadrillion tokens, half of which were sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin. Buterin's donation of SHIB to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and the burning of 40% of the total supply increased SHIB's visibility. SHIB's integration with Ethereum allows for projects like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and plans for a future NFT platform and DAO-based governance system. These developments suggest potential for broader utility in the crypto space, making SHIB appear attractive in the current market cycle. Floki: From Meme Coin to Multifaceted Cryptocurrency with Real-World Utility Floki, inspired by Elon Musk's Shiba Inu named Floki, started as a meme coin in June 2021. It has evolved to provide utility and charitable initiatives, such as building schools in countries like Laos and Nigeria. Floki offers projects including the NFT metaverse game Valhalla and the DeFi service FlokiFi. These enhance its utility within and beyond its ecosystem. Floki's partnership with NOWPayments and its prepaid Floki Card enable real-world transactions with FLOKI tokens. This diversification into NFTs, DeFi, and real-world utility sets it apart from other meme coins. In the current market cycle, Floki's expanding ecosystem and practical applications may make it an attractive option. Turbo Token: The First AI-Created Memecoin in Cryptocurrency Turbo Token is a cryptocurrency that marks a new chapter in digital assets as the first memecoin created by artificial intelligence. Originating from a simple challenge posed to GPT-4, the project's founder sought to develop the next notable meme coin. This initiative combines the viral appeal of memecoins with the innovative capabilities of AI technology. Turbo Token introduces a novel approach to cryptocurrency creation, showcasing how AI can contribute to financial innovation. In the current market cycle, Turbo Token has garnered attention due to its unique genesis and potential for community engagement. Its AI-driven development may make it an attractive option for those interested in emerging trends within the crypto market. Conclusion While Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Floki, and Turbo show less short-term promise, DOGEN stands out. Designed for those seeking luxury and success, it's expected to grow 700% by the end of presale with potential thousand-fold returns. Following successful tokens like BONK and Popcat, DOGEN builds a community of leaders and offers real benefits, including exclusive campaigns for early adopters.

For the debate to gain serious momentum, the U.S. would need to see its global economic dominance genuinely threatened. At present, market sentiment suggests confidence in the U.S.’s continued supremacy.” Trump, on the 2024 campaign trail, promised to establish a national Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve to drum up support among cryptocurrency enthusiasts. This initiative has garnered attention, with some analysts suggesting it could lead to significant appreciation in Bitcoin’s value. Indeed, in the weeks following Election Day, Bitcoin reached an all-time high of over $108,300. But even before Trump changed his stance on Bitcoin, the U.S. already stood at the top of the global Bitcoin mining chart, producing approximately 37.8% of the world’s Bitcoin hash rate as of 2022, according to the government Energy Information Administration. Also, the U.S. dollar also maintains its dominance globally, handling about 58% of all trade and 59% of all currency reserves. As such, Young Ju expects the U.S. only to accept a strategic Bitcoin reserve if it sees its global dominance threatened. See his full comment below.

As geopolitical shifts and economic uncertainties continue to influence global markets, a notable trend is emerging among Koreans, Young Ju says: They’re increasingly turning to U.S. dollars as a safe haven, eclipsing both gold and Bitcoin. This reflects a broader global sentiment that favors the dollar’s relative stability and raises questions about how U.S. economic policies will evolve under Trump’s leadership. Trump has only been an outspoken advocate for cryptocurrency for less than a year, explicitly doubting its potential as a cornerstone of future financial systems when he was in office the last time. I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity…. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 12, 2019 Trump’s stance on Bitcoin may shift yet again depending on the broader political landscape, Young Ju observes. “If Trump succeeds in showcasing U.S. economic resilience, reinforcing the dollar’s supremacy, and boosting his approval ratings, it’s unclear if he would maintain the strong pro-Bitcoin stance he demonstrated during his campaign,” he adds. “He could easily step back from his Bitcoin advocacy, citing changing priorities, without alienating his voter base.” For Young Ju and other crypto professionals, the question remains: Was Trump’s mention of Bitcoin at the BTC Conference a serious step toward a “Bitcoin Standard,” or was it “a calculated move to secure votes?” “It remains uncertain how much of his campaign rhetoric on Bitcoin he intends to fulfill,” Young Ju says.

Their convictions revealed a high-stakes scheme of bribery and market manipulation designed to rig the crypto exchange for profit. Prosecutors Unveiled the Bithumb Bribery Plot The scandal revolved around a plot to inflate the value of a low-profile digital asset. Businessman Kang Jong-hyun, seeking quick profits, devised a plan to list the coin on Bithumb . To make this happen, Kang offered lavish bribes to Lee Sang-jun, Bithumb’s former CEO. The bribes included cash totaling 3 billion Korean won, equivalent to $2 million, luxury watches, designer bags, and exclusive restaurant memberships. Lee accepted these gifts and facilitated the altcoin listing, setting the stage for Kang’s desired price surge. Lee was sentenced to two years in prison for his role. Despite his conviction, questions remain about his possible secret ownership of Bithumb and the extent of his influence within the crypto exchange. Investigators are uncovering more about Kang’s activities, but his involvement in rigging altcoin prices is clear. Ahn Sung-hyun’s Double Dealing in the Scheme Ahn Sung-hyun, a professional golfer married to actress Song Yu-ri, was a key player in delivering the bribes. Kang entrusted Ahn with funds to secure Lee’s cooperation. However, instead of handing over all the money, Ahn siphoned off 2 billion Korean won, about $1.5 million for his stock investments. This act of self-interest drew harsh criticism from the court. Judges described Ahn’s actions as “heinous,” emphasizing that he exploited stolen funds for personal gain. As a result, Ahn received a four-and-a-half-year sentence, marking a dramatic fall from grace for the once-celebrated athlete. This scandal highlights the vulnerabilities in the crypto market, where lack of regulation allows bad actors to manipulate prices for personal gain. The trust in the crypto industry has been eroded as critics point out the ease with which individuals can exploit systems without facing serious consequences. In November, Jimmy Donaldson, popularly known as MrBeast, found himself at the heart of a crypto controversy . Blockchain analysts suggested that MrBeast used his immense online influence to orchestrate multiple pump-and-dump schemes. According to analysts, MrBeast may have earned over $23 million from these practices, further fueling concerns about the ethics and regulation of the crypto space. Additionally, Bithumb’s deep involvement in this latest bribery and market manipulation case might lead to stricter regulations across the industry.

LCAI’s AI-blockchain fusion hints at a decentralized future, sparking debates on its potential to rival Solana by 2025. Table of Contents A glimpse at Solana’s rise and its comparison to LCAI Lightchain AI’s technology bridges the gap between AI and blockchain Tokenomics that drive long-term value A roadmap to rival Solana’s growth trajectory Could LCAI outperform Solana by 2025? Lightchain AI is a rising star Lightchain AI (LCAI) is capturing significant attention in the cryptocurrency market, priced attractively at $0.003 during its presale stage. Drawing comparisons to Solana ’s meteoric rise, LCAI’s unique approach to integrating AI with blockchain offers a glimpse into the future of decentralized technologies. Could this emerging altcoin truly rival Solana’s success by the end of 2025? You might also like: Lightchain AI: The Dogecoin alternative investors can’t afford to overlook A glimpse at Solana’s rise and its comparison to LCAI Solana’s climb to win was pushed by its aim on fast deals and small fees, making it a pick among builders and users. Its growth set a new mark in the block chain area. Likewise, Lightchain AI is pushing limits with its fresh tech, including a Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) This tool lets makers create smart apps that run on their own, giving a touch of smarts to block chain tasks. While Solana did well in growth, LCAI goe͏s beyond by mixing in clever thinking, making its own space in the block chain world. By mixing smart AI skills with shared systems, LCAI gives a place made for the future that attracts builders and companies looking for cleverer, better ways to solve problems. Its a big step forward for blockchain world. Lightchain AI’s technology bridges the gap between AI and blockchain The AIVM is Lightchain AI’s flagship invention, designed to seamlessly integrate AI capabilities into decentralized applications. This unique technology enables industries such as healthcare, supply chain, and finance to leverage AI for predictive modeling, data analytics, and real-time optimization. By combining the power of blockchain with advanced AI tools, the AIVM empowers businesses to solve complex problems with greater efficiency and precision. Unlike Solana, which focuses on DeFi and NFT platforms, Lightchain AI is establishing itself as a leader in AI-powered solutions tailored for diverse industries. Whether it’s improving patient outcomes in healthcare, optimizing logistics in supply chains, or enhancing decision-making in finance, LCAI’s AIVM is revolutionizing how organizations harness AI within blockchain ecosystems. It’s not just technology — it’s the future of AI and blockchain combined. Tokenomics that drive long-term value Lightchain AI’s tokenomics are meticulously designed to foster sustainable growth and long-term value for its ecosystem. The LCAI token serves multiple functions, from facilitating transactions and incentivizing developers to enabling community governance. By ensuring equitable distribution, the platform avoids centralization risks and encourages widespread participation. A deflationary model adds another layer of value, with a portion of transaction fees burned to reduce the token supply over time, creating scarcity and supporting price stability. Rewards for staking and active contributions incentivize ongoing engagement while adaptive inflation mechanisms ensure the ecosystem remains dynamic as it scales. With a focus on balanced allocation for ecosystem growth, community rewards, and developer incentives, Lightchain AI’s tokenomics provide a robust framework for fostering creativity and maintaining value, making it a standout in the competitive crypto landscape. A roadmap to rival Solana’s growth trajectory Lightchain AI’s strategic roadmap sets it apart as a contender to rival Solana’s growth. The project begins with a solid foundation, including the development of its core technologies, followed by a robust testnet phase to ensure scalability and performance. By March 2025, the mainnet launch will activate decentralized governance, token staking, and real-world AI functionalities, attracting validators and contributors to solidify its ecosystem. Subsequent phases focus on ecosystem expansion, cross-chain integrations, and partnerships with industries like healthcare, finance, and logistics. With a clear plan for global adoption, Lightchain AI leverages grants and outreach programs to attract developers and enterprises. This methodical approach, coupled with community-driven initiatives and unique inventions, positions Lightchain AI to rival Solana’s trajectory, becoming a dominant player in the blockchain industry. Could LCAI outperform Solana by 2025? Lightchain AI is emerging as a serious contender in the blockchain space, thanks to its unique integration of artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. While Solana currently holds a strong market position, Lightchain AI’s unique approach could set it apart in the coming years. Analysts believe that if the platform gains adoption in key industries like finance, healthcare, and supply chain, it has the potential to significantly disrupt the market. Predictions suggest that Lightchain AI’s price could exceed $2 by the end of 2025, possibly outperforming the impressive early growth metrics of Solana. This blend of unique technology and market potential positions Lightchain AI as a project to watch closely for those exploring the next wave of blockchain invention. Lightchain AI is a rising star For investors seeking the next big opportunity, Lightchain AI offers a compelling case. Its unique technology, deflationary tokenomics, and ambitious roadmap make it a strong contender to rival Solana’s success.

The ETF will trade on CFTC-registered exchanges, providing regulated exposure to Solana’s price movements. This move could pave the way for spot Solana ETFs in the future. Volatility shares propose Solana Futures ETF with leverage options Volatility Shares recently submitted a proposal to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to create an ETF based on Solana futures. This filing presents new ways for traders to take advantage of Solana (SOL) price changes in both directions. The proposed ETF will be offered in levels of leverage, including 1x, 2x, and -1x, according to risk preference. Solana ETF Registration Statement | Source: Volatility Shares The filing is important because investors who want to bet on Solana’s future have more options. Solana is known for its blockchains, which allow for speedy transactions and low fees. Adding the -1x inverse product also allows investors to make money if Solana’s price drops. Volatility Shares has played a leading role in achieving the approval and launch of Ethereum (ETH) futures ETFs and is dedicated to continuing to pursue new concepts within this space. The company has also led in the creation of asset-class blended ETFs, such as BTC+ETH and S&P+VIX, that can ease the process of diversification for the modern investor. Impact on Solana and the Crypto ETF Market The price of Solana has just dropped by 2.87%. Other cryptocurrencies like BNB and XRP have already surpassed Solana in the rankings. Analysts predicted that the price of Solana would surge in the future, particularly if the SEC approves a spot Solana ETF. Market experts believe this approval could take the price of SOL up to $1,000. Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, commented on the filing, saying it was a brave decision. Balchunas said the timing was odd since Solana futures are not yet available. He also mentioned the risk of having a 2x leveraged product that could cause big changes in value. However, this filing might help approve spot Solana ETFs, which would let people invest directly in the cryptocurrency instead of depending on future contracts. Balchunas said Litecoin and HBAR ETFs might get approved before Solana, making this filing important in the industry. This proposal is not the first time Volatility Shares LLC has tried to enter the crypto ETF market. Before this, several companies, like VanEck and 21Shares, applied for spot Solana ETFs, but the SEC has not approved any of these products during its current rules. Considering these challenges, even applying for a Solana futures ETF may be the best decision for Volatility Shares, especially given that regulation changes will likely arrive soon since new leadership at the SEC should be on their way within days. The Solana futures ETF application was made just days after Christmas, when market activity is often quiet. The filing from Volatility Shares hints at the rising demand for regulated Solana ETFs. Such products could standardize access to digital assets for diverse investors. The SEC’s decision will determine the course of crypto ETF innovation.

The price has been stagnant, neither breaking down nor rallying, as it consolidates and prepares for what could be a significant move. This period of indecision has fueled speculation among DOGE enthusiasts, with many wondering if the popular meme coin is poised for a breakout or further decline. Related Reading: Bitcoin $90K Level Is Crucial For Bulls – Price Could Tag $79K If BTC Loses It Adding to the intrigue, crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently shared key data suggesting a potential bullish outlook for Dogecoin. According to Martinez, whales have accumulated over 90 million DOGE in the past 48 hours, a significant indicator of long-term optimism. Historically, whale activity has often preceded notable price movements, hinting at the possibility of renewed momentum. While the short-term outlook remains unclear, this whale accumulation could act as a strong foundation for Dogecoin’s next move. However, the meme coin must overcome its current indecision before any substantial trend emerges. Can Dogecoin rally and reignite its meme-driven hype, or will it succumb to further consolidation? Only time will tell as DOGE approaches a critical juncture. Dogecoin Whales Prepare For A Move Dogecoin has been navigating through a challenging phase, with its price experiencing significant drops in recent weeks. Despite the bearish sentiment dominating the broader market, whales have consistently taken advantage of the dip, signaling long-term confidence in the meme coin. This accumulation trend underscores the potential for a bullish reversal in the near future. Martinez recently highlighted compelling on-chain data, revealing that whales purchased over 90 million DOGE in the past 48 hours alone. This buying spree adds to a growing trend of whale accumulation during the current market pullback. Martinez’s analysis suggests that large-scale investors are positioning themselves for a long-term rally, viewing the current price levels as an opportunity rather than a risk. Historically, whale activity has often foreshadowed significant price movements and Dogecoin’s current scenario appears no different. If DOGE can maintain its position above the crucial $0.31 level, the foundation for a massive rally will solidify. However, breaching this support could open the door to further downside, adding urgency to the current consolidation phase. Related Reading: Chainlink Is Forming A Head-And-Shoulders Pattern – Confirmation Could Take LINK To $14 As accumulation continues and key support levels hold, Dogecoin’s bullish outlook remains intact. Investors are now watching closely to see if this meme coin can capitalize on whale confidence and spark its next upward surge. Key Levels To Hold Dogecoin is trading at $0.31, reflecting a tug-of-war between bulls and bears. Recent price action saw DOGE fail to reclaim the $0.35 mark, a key resistance level that needs to be broken for bulls to regain control. On the downside, attempts to break below $0.30 have also been unsuccessful, signaling strong demand at this level. However, the indecision leaves DOGE at a critical juncture, with both bullish and bearish scenarios still in play. For bulls to reclaim momentum, Dogecoin must push above $0.37 and hold it as support. Breaking and sustaining this level would signal renewed strength, potentially setting the stage for a rally. Without this breakthrough, however, DOGE risks losing its current foothold. Related Reading: ONDO Faces 30% Correction Risk If It Loses $1.46 Support – Top Analyst The broader market sentiment leans bearish, with many altcoins showing signs of vulnerability. If the market enters a deeper correction, DOGE could break below the $0.30 support. Such a move could trigger a cascade of selling, pushing the price as low as $0.20, a significant psychological level and historical support.

The Ethereum Classic price is anticipated to see a 20% increase. Similarly, the Bittensor price prediction indicates a potential rise to an all-time high of $1,098. Meanwhile, BlockDAG has distinguished itself as the best crypto to buy today, thanks to its unprecedented presale achievements and the attractive BDAG400 bonus offer. With over $173 million collected and more than 17.5 billion coins distributed, BlockDAG is swiftly becoming a focal point of discussion within the cryptocurrency community. The BDAG400 promotion from BlockDAG, concluding soon, provides increasing rewards for each purchase, capturing the interest of holders keen to enhance their returns. Whether drawn by the upward movement of ETC and TAO or the dynamic potential of BlockDAG, the cryptocurrency market is ripe with possibilities. Ethereum Classic (ETC) Price Climbs as Market Rebounds The Ethereum Classic (ETC) price is exhibiting signs of a robust recovery. After a marked decline, ETC has advanced by over 22%, attracting both longstanding holders and active traders. On-chain data points to a significant $22.85 million withdrawal of ETC from exchanges, suggesting active accumulation by holders. Analysts suggest that if the Ethereum Classic price remains above $28.50, it could surge by 20%, targeting $34.25 in the near term. With the ETC price drawing increasing scrutiny from traders and large-scale buyers, it is emerging as a notable asset in the current market resurgence. Anticipating a Bittensor Price Surge: What’s Next? Bittensor is capturing attention in the crypto sector with its notable growth and commitment to developing a decentralized, transparent AI ecosystem. The latest Bittensor price prediction posits that TAO could hit up to $845 by the end of 2024, assuming positive market conditions. Even under pessimistic scenarios, the forecast suggests a resilient price floor around $454. TAO’s unique strategy and expanding base position it as an appealing prospect for those interested in the intersection of AI and blockchain technology. BlockDAG’s BDAG400 Bonus Creates a Stir: A Look at the Returns BlockDAG is rapidly making headway in the cryptocurrency arena with its unique attributes and remarkable success in presales. The network’s presale efforts have amassed over $173 million and facilitated the distribution of more than 17.5 billion coins. Moreover, early holders of the coin have seen a staggering 2240% ROI as the price of BDAG escalated from $0.001 in the initial presale to $0.0234 in the latest, batch 26. This batch is nearing sell-out as interest from both the existing community and new traders continues to swell. With an impending significant price increase in the next batch, acting now could be advisable. Overall, BlockDAG’s notable metrics underscore its status as one of the best cryptos to buy today. A primary factor in BlockDAG’s growing appeal is its BDAG400 bonus program, which introduces increasing rewards with each subsequent purchase. The initial bonus offers a substantial 250% reward, escalating to 270% with the second bonus. Further purchases enable participants to access even greater bonuses through engaging mystery boxes. This progressive reward system has sparked considerable interest among traders, prompting them to act quickly to maximize their returns before the promotion concludes. BlockDAG’s sustained achievements serve as proof of its strategic foresight and execution capabilities. By presenting significant rewards and cultivating a strong community bond, BlockDAG is recognized as the best crypto to buy now for those aiming for both growth and substantial returns. The Bottom Line The Ethereum Classic (ETC) price is experiencing upward momentum, with projections suggesting a potential 20% increase, while the Bittensor price prediction indicates it might achieve a new all-time high soon. Yet, it is BlockDAG that has cemented its place as one of the best cryptos to buy today. Its unparalleled presale success, having raised over $173 million and issued more than 17.5 billion coins, highlights its expansive influence. The BDAG400 bonus scheme enhances its allure, offering layered rewards that increase with each purchase. As potential buyers weigh their options, BlockDAG distinguishes itself as a venture that not only promises profitability and growth potential but also ensures a rewarding experience for all involved.

Shiba Inu’s fundamentals have also deteriorated in the past few days. First, Shibarium’s network is not growing as it did months ago.

Its total value locked has also dropped to $3.55 million from over $6 million on Dec. 7. These numbers are important for Shiba Inu because Shibarium is its layer-2 network, and its success matters. Also, Shibarium’s fees , which are in form of BONE, are usually converted into SHIB and then burned. Burning is a process where cryptocurrencies are moved into an inaccessible wallet. These numbers likely explain why Shiba Inu’s burn rate crashed by over 98% in the last 24 hours to 507,123 SHIB. That burn has brought Shiba Inu’s circulating supply to 584 trillion tokens, much lower than its total supply of over 999 trillion. Shiba Inu could lose key support SHIB price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the SHIB price has dropped sharply after peaking at $0.000033 in December. It has fallen and moved slightly below the 50-day moving average. There are signs that the coin is forming a bearish pennant chart pattern, which is made up of a vertical line and a triangle. This pattern often leads to more downside. On the positive side, Shiba Inu remains above the ascending trendline that connects the lowest swings since August. It has failed to move below that level at least six times since then, offering hopes of a rebound. A drop below that support will be a sign that bears have prevailed, which will lead to more downside, potentially to $0.00001590, its lowest level on Oct. 25.

Data collected by CryptoSlam shows that with less than a week left before 2024 ends, NFT sales for the year have amounted to $8,717,920,832, edging out 2023’s tally by about $230,000. The Numbers Last year, the sector recorded more than 91.55 million transactions, bringing in $8.71 billion per CryptoSlam. However, in 2024, the total transactions dropped significantly, only reaching 70.89 million. Nonetheless, an increase in unique buyers and sellers helped balance the scales, with the former totaling 7.5 million and the latter reaching 4 million. These were the highest recorded figures since 2017, the closest being the 3.8 million sellers captured last year and the 5.4 million buyers from 2022. There have long been discussions about the prospects of the NFT space, with the hype that once engulfed them dying down considerably. But analysts have urged against writing off the industry altogether, a sentiment justified by the year’s performance, which, while some ways below 2022’s record-setting sales of $23.7 billion from 56 million transactions, has been markedly better than expected. The next best period was 2021, when the sector raked in $15.7 billion from 34 million transactions involving 3.6 million unique sellers and over 5 million buyers. 2024’s numbers are on course to be the third-highest returns on record, marginally beating last year’s figures. The space also recently suffered casualties when the Nike-owned RTFKT project announced it would close shop in 2025 after earning almost $50 million since its launch. Monthly Insights Looking more short-term, the last month presented a mixed outlook for NFTs. While global sales volumes went up 19.43% to $912 million, unique buyer and seller numbers fell by nearly 28%, reflecting a more selective market approach. Additionally, transactions saw a 59.25% drop from the previous month, suggesting that fewer but more valuable exchanges may have driven the sector’s growth. Overall, Ethereum remains the top blockchain for NFT sales, contributing $495.7 million in the last 30 days alone. In second and third place were Bitcoin and Solana, which respectively generated $191.4 million and $107 million in that period. Interestingly, the two blockchains went in completely opposite directions with regard to attracting buyers. CryptoSlam data shows that NFT purchasers on the Bitcoin network skyrocketed by more than 80% in the last month, while those on Solana dropped by at least 37%. Immutable and Mythos rounded up the top five blockchains by monthly NFT sales volume. The former registered $35 million worth of sales, a 66.51% jump from the previous month, while the latter shed 36.72% from its tally in the same period, only reaching $25.4 million.

Table of Contents DOGEN presale hits midpoint, drawing major whale investments Dogecoin: From meme to major cryptocurrency Shiba Inu: An Ethereum-based meme coin with growing utility Conclusion A new player in the meme coin arena is turning heads. Priced at a mere $0.0013, this token is stepping up alongside Dogecoin and Shiba Inu in the ambitious race toward $1. The crypto world is buzzing with speculation: will this underdog defy the odds and soar to new heights? DOGEN presale hits midpoint, drawing major whale investments Things are heating up at DOGEN as the presale gains unstoppable momentum. Stage 8 sold out in record time, with whales swooping in and dropping big money to secure DOGEN while it’s still at a bargain. Why the frenzy? Because DOGEN isn’t just a meme token — it’s quickly becoming the hottest asset on the market. Presale stage 9 is live — still time to get in early The rush isn’t over yet; Presale stage 9 is officially open, offering a golden opportunity to grab DOGEN at a steal before the next price jump. With 13 stages in total, each round pushes the price higher as the presale nears its conclusion. Those watching from the sidelines now could be the time to act.

Real alphas make their moves early Here’s why DOGEN stands out: it’s not just another meme token. It’s a symbol of dominance and potential, the alpha dog leading this altcoin season. Early adopters are already seeing the momentum build, with thousands of investors piling in and excitement spreading fast. The earlier someone joins the pack, the bigger their potential rewards — and with whales setting the tone, DOGEN is poised for explosive growth. Big money means big moves — don’t get left behind The presence of whales is a clear signal: DOGEN is heating up, and the price is set to skyrocket. This isn’t just speculation — it’s happening now. Dogecoin: From meme to major cryptocurrency Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency that began in 2013 as a light-hearted alternative to traditional coins, featuring a Shiba Inu dog as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a capped supply, Dogecoin has no maximum limit, and 10,000 new coins are mined every minute. In 2021, its value soared, boosted by social media and endorsements from figures like Elon Musk, making it one of the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The coin’s abundant supply and active community have made it popular for small transactions and tipping online. In the current market cycle, Dogecoin continues to draw interest due to its strong community support and high visibility in the crypto space. Shiba Inu: An Ethereum-based meme coin with growing utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency inspired by Dogecoin but operates on the Ethereum blockchain, enhancing its compatibility with the Ethereum ecosystem. Launched in August 2020 by the anonymous developer Ryoshi, SHIB began with a supply of 1 quadrillion tokens, half of which were sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin. Buterin’s donation of SHIB to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and the burning of 40% of the total supply increased SHIB’s visibility. SHIB’s integration with Ethereum allows for projects like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and plans for a future NFT platform and DAO-based governance system. These developments suggest potential for broader utility in the crypto space, making SHIB appear attractive in the current market cycle. Conclusion With DOGE and SHIB showing less short-term potential, DOGEN emerges as the meme token for those seeking luxury and success. Following in the footsteps of tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat, DOGEN aims to build a community of alpha leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks for early adopters.

Notably, in recent trading sessions, Bitcoin has struggled to reclaim the critical $100,000 resistance level, which remains a pivotal threshold for reaching new highs. Now, prominent cryptocurrency trading analyst Ali Martinez has highlighted that, based on historical trends, a Bitcoin correction of 20% to 30% could be “the most bullish thing” for the asset, as shared in an X post on December 27. Bitcoin historical price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/Ali_charts As per the analysis, it can summed up that regular price corrections are a hallmark of a healthy market. “A 20% to 30% correction is the most bullish thing that could happen to Bitcoin,” he said. In this line, Bitcoin has historically shown a recurring pattern of strong rallies followed by notable retracements, typically in the 20% to 30% range. Following such trends, Bitcoin has often surged to new highs. This pattern, observed multiple times since 2016, suggests that Bitcoin’s current price movement could follow a similar trajectory. What next for Bitcoin? At the same time, Martinez identified key levels that investors should watch closely. His December 27 post warned of “free-fall territory” if Bitcoin falls below $92,730. “You don’t want Bitcoin to dip below $92,730—it’s essentially free-fall territory if that level breaks,” he cautioned. Using data from the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) chart, he pointed to a gap in realized price activity between $92,730 and around the $105,000 mark. This void indicates a dip below $92,730 could lead to a sharp decline, potentially dropping Bitcoin to the $60,000 zone . Bitcoin UTXO Realized Price Distribution. Source: Glassnode/Ali_charts Despite the short-term bearish outlook, Bitcoin has had an impressive run in 2024, adding over $1 trillion in market capitalization . The rally has been fueled by the latest halving cycle and optimism stemming from Donald Trump’s election victory , with his administration pledging to implement pro-crypto policies. Looking ahead, analysts maintain a bullish outlook for Bitcoin, particularly with expectations of increased institutional adoption under a pro-cryptocurrency government. To this end, as reported by Finbold, banking giant Standard Chartered predicts Bitcoin could reach $200,000 by the end of 2024. Bitcoin price analysis As of press time, Bitcoin was trading at $94,249, down 0.15% in the past 24 hours but up 1.75% on the weekly timeframe. However, the short-term technical setup shows that Bitcoin is still in trouble. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold For instance, Bitcoin’s current price is below its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $94,670, signaling mild short-term weakness. Additionally, the Fear & Greed Index at 72 (Greed) reflects optimistic sentiment, while the 14-day relative strength index ( RSI ) of 44.41 indicates neutral to slightly bearish momentum. Despite this, Bitcoin remains well above its 200-day SMA of $70,978, maintaining a bullish long-term trend. In the short term, caution is advised as Bitcoin approaches critical support levels at $92,000 and $90,000.

Meanwhile, crypto presale token Lunex Network (LNEX) has continued its majestic stride towards the $10m mark, surpassing $5.5M today. Lunex is in its crypto presale and has amassed widespread popularity and support partly due to its amazing presale outing and incredible features. This article will help you understand why Lunex is considered a moonshot token over PEPE and Near Protocol (NEAR). You might also like: ETH ETF breakthrough; SOL prepares for massive surge as Lunex gains traction Lunex Network: the new DEX token in presale Lunex Network transforms the DEX landscape by executing perfect cross-chain transactions and prioritizing user privacy. Lunex offers a more streamlined and convenient trading experience than traditional platforms like PEPE and NEAR by removing the need for third-party wallets. Investors who prioritize privacy will find Lunex to be the ideal choice due to its support for user anonymity and its ability to provide complete control over trading activities without the need for KYC checks. Forecasts for the DeFi industry peg a three-year growth spurt to $502 billion. The key characteristics of Lunex, such as its strong security and smooth interoperability, ensure Lunex’s strong position and likelihood of gaining a huge market share. Lunex holders also generate passive income without tying up assets in liquidity pools through the profit-sharing system, distributing a share of the platform’s weekly revenues. Combined with an annual percentage yield of 18%, which is possible after just 30 days of owning LNEX tokens, Lunex presents an excellent platform for long-term growth overall. Lunex is currently available for a low entry price of $0.0048 and is selling fast in its crypto presale. PEPE whale activity fuels bearish concern among investors A PEPE whale recently surprised the cryptocurrency community, causing serious concerns among PEPE investors. The whale’s $2.72 million investment of 150 billion PEPE on Binance has fueled speculations of intention to sell at the right price via a stop-loss order. When the price of PEPE tokens drops below a certain threshold, the whale could plan to sell them to prevent losses. Reports show that the whale had originally acquired the 150 billion PEPE on November 28, when it was worth $2.94. The whale’s behavior throughout PEPE’s price corrections suggested a holding maneuver. Now that PEPE’s price performance has dropped significantly, the whale may have opted to sell the asset, as indicated by its deposit. PEPE’s price has dropped 23% in the last week, now trading at $0.000018. At the present market price of PEPE tokens, the whale has lost more than $250,000. Near Protocol struggles despite groundbreaking partnership In November, Near Protocol (NEAR) announced its groundbreaking complete integration with MetaMask, making NEAR the first non-EVM blockchain. Theoretically, this collaboration should increase accessibility and user uptake, but thus, NEAR’s price hasn’t reacted to the news. Investors have been left with a grim image by NEAR’s recent performance. The token’s price has dropped by 18% from last week to $5.60. Yet, NEAR’s market value has gained strength by 7% to $6.81 billion. Whether the Christmas and New Year holidays are enough to rally NEAR remains unknown. Yet, with PEPE and NEAR uncertain and showing mixed signals, investors are turning their attention to Lunex, the moonshot token in its crypto presale.

Prince Elon (ELONPRIN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONPRIN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Prince Elon can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Prince Elon could become the next viral memecoin. Prince Elon launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Prince Elon on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Prince Elon by entering its contract address – 7rAsmWGTtPFY9RFnhd9biard7PrWtw5ZigowwfmaXUQ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONPRIN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-28 17:22:00

The introduction of the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) and growing global interest in blockchain-based payment solutions have prompted traditional financial institutions to compete with established crypto firms like Tether Holdings. European Banks Enter Stablecoin Market A number of European banks have started to implement their own stablecoins to capture their share of a market that is said to earn billions of dollars in profit every year. The France-based Societe Generale – Forge (SG-Forge) has now opened its Euro-backed stablecoin for retail investors. In the same vein, the Frankfurt based Oddo BHF SCA and the London based Revolut are also looking to launch Euro stablecoins, while AllUnity, another issuer backed by Deutsche Bank’s asset management arm DWS, intends to launch its Euro stablecoin in 2025. According to Jean-Marc Stenger, the CEO of SG-Forge, more banks will adopt bank-issued stablecoins; he simply said, “Yes”. SG-Forge is currently in discussions with about ten banks as potential partners or users of SG-Forge stablecoin issuing technology. Similarly, Visa Inc., the global payments technology company, is also working with banks such as BBVA to create a stablecoin solution using blockchain. Cuy Sheffield, the head of crypto at Visa, stated that the company is currently in talks with institutions in Hong Kong, Singapore and Brazil. US Banks Await Regulatory Green Light In the United States, banks are keen on the legislation changes that can permit them to offer stablecoins. As the regulatory environment is being discussed, some banks such as JPMorgan Chase has already started testing payment systems that are based on blockchain. While JPMorgan has used its deposit token, JPM Coin in internal transfers, it does not possess the same open connectivity that is characteristic of stablecoins that can be accessed with any crypto wallet. Naveen Mallela, co-head of JP Morgan’s digital assets division Kinexys, said that they are anticipated to gain more market acceptance in the next three years. He pointed out that stablecoins and tokenized deposits could both work side by side as different payment methods. However, there are still certain issues that can be considered as problematic for US banks. There is ambiguity on which types of reserves are allowed to back stablecoins and if the deposits would be eligible for federal insurance. These problems should not be overlooked because, as the experts point out, they may lead to some confusion in periods of financial turmoil. MiCA Brings Stablecoin Regulatory Clarity in Europe The regulation of MiCA is a major milestone for stablecoin issuers in Europe as it will come into force on the 30th of December 2024. MiCA ensures that stablecoin providers have proper licenses to offer their services in the EU and also sets down some guidelines on reserve management and investor protection. 1/ MiCA is here! Starting Dec 30, 2024, the EU’s groundbreaking crypto regulation takes effect. What does this mean for crypto providers, stablecoins like $USDT and $USDC , and investors? Let’s break it down pic.twitter.com/dgMG5DVC0D — Fefe Demeny (@FefeDemeny) December 28, 2024 Circle’s USDC stablecoin has already been approved under MiCA and can now be used more extensively across the region. However, Tether Holdings, the market leader, has not mentioned plans for obtaining a license for the Euro pegged stablecoin . Experts claim that this could open up possibilities for banks as well as rivals to step in the niche. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank has expressed concerns about the potential impact of stablecoins on traditional banking. A recent ECB study found that converting retail deposits into stablecoins could weaken a bank’s liquidity coverage ratio. Central Banks and Consortium Coins While commercial banks move to issue stablecoins, central banks are actively developing central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). These government-backed digital currencies could eventually compete with or replace bank-issued stablecoins in wholesale payment systems. Avtar Sehra, CEO of Libre Capital, noted, “Everyone is exploring some form of commercial bank digital currency. But many may prefer consortium coins.” Several banks are reportedly considering forming alliances to create shared blockchain-based tokens for broader interoperability and efficiency. Concurrently, Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin which debuted on December 16, 2024 quickly gained traction in the global crypto market. Moreover, the RLUSD was recently listed on Independent Reserve, a licensed crypto exchange in Singapore.

Remittix, a low-cap PayFi token, emerges as XRP’s rival, with experts predicting a 40,000% surge by 2025 amid rising demand. Table of Contents Crypto EA remains optimistic for Ripple as price goes in the red Remittix seen as a presale sensation with high upside potential Will Remittix evolve into the next Ripple? The crypto market offers limitless opportunities, and often, a new project appears that could change an entire industry. One such project is Remittix (RTX) , a new low-cap PayFi token that could change the cross-border payments space. Some analysts are even saying this rookie could be Ripple (XRP) 2.0, which has dominated this sector since its launch. Although experts like Crypto EA have made bullish predictions for this altcoin, XRP has been experiencing a downtrend on the price charts. Therefore, investors are now sidestepping one of the top crypto coins for RTX – a presale star. Demand is so high that analysts predict a potential 40,000% surge in 2025. You might also like: Ethereum whales are accumulating Shiba Inu and Remittix – here’s why Crypto EA remains optimistic for Ripple as price goes in the red Ripple has been regarded as one of the top 10 altcoins, but its price has experienced quite a few swings in the past. The one-week trend as shown by CoinMarketCap indicates that the price of Ripple depreciated by around 10%. The value has plummeted greatly from approximately $2.60 to almost $2.30 in only a couple of days. However, market expert Crypto EA remains optimistic about Ripple. According to his recent X post , this crypto coin could experience a massive price explosion. As a long-term Ripple price prediction, he set a $31 price target by 2026. The technical analysis for the Ripple coin is also bullish. TradingView data points to this altcoin being valued above its 30-day EMA ($2.11) and its 50-day EMA ($1.82). Additionally, its bull-bear power sits at -0.05, which is in the buy zone and suggests bulls are in control. Remittix seen as a presale sensation with high upside potential While Ripple paved the way for fast cross-border payments, Remittix is working on improving this space. It will launch a crypto-to-fiat network that lets traders convert over 40 crypto coins to Fiat currencies. These currencies will then be sent to bank accounts all over the world. With this aspect, Remittix will stand out from the likes of Stripe or Wise, which do not let users send funds via crypto, which is then converted. Not only that, but the Remittix Pay API will also allow businesses to accept these crypto payments. Therefore, Remittix will benefit both businesses and users. Since there will be no extra charges for FX, wires, or hidden costs, Remittix could become a fan-favorite for millions. The RTX native token will be at the center of its ecosystem. Those who hold this crypto coin will get staking rewards, governance voting rights, and more. Currently, one RTX token costs only $0.0156. However, this price will rise to $0.0163 once the next stage of the presale starts. Furthermore, traders are waiting for a Tier-1 CEX like Uniswap to list RTX, which could trigger a jump to $0.09. This could make RTX one of the top crypto coins for fast returns. Will Remittix evolve into the next Ripple? Remittix might just stand to give Ripple a run for its money regarding cross-border payments. The invention it brings, its strong foundation, and its upside potential could make RTX a powerful force in this area. Some experts suggest that the price of this altcoin may even soar as high as 40,000% in 2025. To learn more about Remittix, visit the Remittix presale and join the Remittix community.

The Virginia resident, who is 80-years-old and identified as Kay, says she received a message from someone impersonating Wells Fargo warning her account had been frozen, reports the NBC-affiliated news station WWBT. Kay says the message included a number that she was directed to call to unlock her account. She called the number and spoke to someone who claimed to be a Wells Fargo security expert. “I thought, ‘Dear god, what is going on?’ So I called this number, and I did what they told me to do because they told me they were top security at Wells Fargo… I didn’t know it at the time I was talking to scammers.” Soon after the call, Kay realized her life savings had disappeared. “My heart just dropped to my feet. My money was gone.” To recover her funds, Kay says she promptly called and visited Wells Fargo and was told her account would be reimbursed. But after a few days, Kay learned that the lender’s fraud division closed the case, blaming her for giving the scammers access to her account. “This is my life savings; it’s all I have in the world, and again, at my age, I can’t jump out and say, ‘Oh well, I’ll get a job and just reimburse myself.’ I’m not able to do that. I have a lot of health issues.” WWBT touched base with Wells Fargo to inquire about Kay’s case. The bank says it is still investigating the matter.

A poll with over $1.5 million in funds puts these odds at just 27%, down from 60% after Trump’s election. This is a notable prediction since Polymarket has been highly accurate in the past, including its estimate on the last presidential election. Odds of strategic Bitcoin reserves are falling | Source: Polymarket You might also like: US will not approve strategic Bitcoin reserve: CryptoQuant CEO Kalshi users disagree Other participants in the prediction market expect Trump to ultimately accept Bitcoin ( BTC ) as a strategic reserve, joining crude oil and gold. Kalshi, for example, has placed the odds of a BTC reserve happening by January 2026 at 61%, the highest point since Dec. 21. Some conservative-leaning states like Texas, Ohio, and Pennsylvania have also started working on their strategic Bitcoin reserves. A bill in Pennsylvania states that the government may invest at least 10% of the State General Fund in Bitcoin to fight inflation. Still, Polymarket and Kalshi users expect the Texas strategic Bitcoin reserve bill to take time. A Polymarket poll places the odds of Texas passing the bill by March next year at 10%, while Kalshi has the odds at 24%. Proponents of the U.S. embracing Bitcoin as a strategic reserve, including Senator Cynthia Lummis , argue that it makes financial sense because of the demand and supply dynamics. Data shows that Bitcoin demand is rising, with spot ETFs having over $128 billion in assets. Supply is falling, with the mining difficulty rising to a record high after the last Bitcoin halving event in April this year. According to CoinGlass, Bitcoin balances in exchanges have continued falling this year. Proponents also point to MicroStrategy’s success, which has helped it become an $80 billion company by becoming the biggest Bitcoin holder. As such, some analysts predict that the U.S. could ultimately use its Bitcoin holdings to pay some of its debt, which currently stands at over $36 trillion. Opponents argue that Bitcoin’s volatility, limited acceptance, market scale, regulatory constraints, and its implications for sovereignty and trust make it an impractical solution for paying off the U.S. national debt. Also, the Federal Reserve has already said that it is not allowed to hold Bitcoin , meaning that it would need a congressional law to do that. Trump has supported Bitcoin and suggested that the government should convert its Bitcoin holdings into strategic reserves. Data by BitcoinTreasuries show that the government holds 198,000 coins valued at $18 billion.

He said at least 50% of its energy must come from renewable sources. Well, miners just hit 54%. This should, in theory, be enough for Tesla to dust off its Bitcoin payment system, as we kindly suggested in the past. Elon’s ultimatum and Bitcoin’s big energy problem Back in May 2021, Elon pulled the plug on Bitcoin payments for Tesla, citing environmental concerns. His issue? Mining Bitcoin was guzzling electricity, much of it coming from coal and other dirty sources. “We are concerned about the rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining,” Elon said at the time. But the 54% progress didn’t happen overnight. It’s the result of miners packing up and moving to regions with cleaner, cheaper power. Think Quebec with its hydro plants, Iceland with its geothermal hotspots, and even sunny Texas, where wind and solar farms are booming. But let’s not pretend Bitcoin’s energy makeover is complete. Mining still devours about 127 terawatt-hours (TWh) a year—more electricity than countries like Argentina. Carbon emissions remain a problem, too, with Bitcoin responsible for around 69 million metric tons of CO₂ annually. That’s roughly the same as Greece’s annual emissions. Clean energy or not, Bitcoin’s power consumption is still a headline magnet for critics. The new energy mix: Less coal, more wind and water Meanwhile, hydropower is leading the renewable pack, making up 23% of the total energy used. Iceland and Quebec are the poster children here, thanks to their abundance of water resources and dirt-cheap electricity. Wind energy is another big player, especially in Texas. Bitcoin miners have swooped in to take advantage of sprawling wind farms and the Lone Star State’s pro-business attitude. Wind now accounts for about 5% of Bitcoin’s energy mix. Solar energy is making moves too, although it’s still a small fry at just 2%. For miners in sunny places, pairing solar panels with battery systems is becoming a trendy way to cut costs and boost energy independence. Then there’s nuclear power, which provides 9% of Bitcoin’s energy. While not technically renewable, nuclear is low on emissions and reliable. It’s especially popular in places where other clean energy options aren’t available. Finally, geothermal energy is quietly being used in places like El Salvador, where volcanic activity powers mining rigs. And coal is still hanging around like an uninvited guest, making up 22% of the energy mix. But that’s a slight improvement from earlier years when coal accounted for 40% of Bitcoin’s power supply. Natural gas is also in the mix at 21%, and while it’s cleaner than coal, it’s not winning any green awards. Bottom line? Renewables are gaining ground, but Bitcoin mining is still far from being liked by environmentalists. Will Tesla bring Bitcoin payments back? The big question now is whether Tesla will reinstate Bitcoin payments. Technically, Elon’s condition has been met. The Bitcoin network has hit 54% renewables, so what’s stopping Tesla from flipping the switch? Part of the hesitation could be tied to politics. Elon is now rubbing elbows with Donald Trump, who’s back in the White House. Elon reportedly donated $277 million to Trump’s presidential campaign and is set to head the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E). This new role gives him unlimited access to the Oval, which could mean smoother sailing for Bitcoin and other digital assets. Trump, for his part, has promised not to introduce any policies that could crash Bitcoin. That’s music to the ears of Bitcoin fans—and probably Elon, too.

XRP: Changing global transactions with speed and efficiency XRP is reshaping the landscape of international payments with its lightning-fast, low-cost transaction capabilities on the XRP Ledger. Designed for seamless, borderless exchanges, XRP eliminates the need for central authorities, ensuring secure and irreversible transactions resistant to censorship and fraud. Created by visionaries Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP debuted with a finite supply of 100 billion tokens. Ripple, the key driver of its ecosystem, holds 80 billion XRP to fuel liquidity and foster growth. By integrating XRP into its network, Ripple delivers swift currency conversions and cross-border transfers, cementing its role as a cornerstone of global financial systems. As the world leans further into digital finance, XRP’s unparalleled efficiency positions it as a transformative force in the payments industry. Kaspa: Redefining blockchain performance with GHOSTDAG technology Kaspa is breaking the mold of traditional blockchain design through its pioneering use of the GHOSTDAG protocol. This revolutionary approach enables blocks created simultaneously to coexist and establishes their sequence via consensus, forming a block Directed Acyclic Graph (blockDAG). This structure pushes the boundaries of Nakamoto consensus, delivering unmatched scalability and lightning-fast block rates — currently at one per second, with ambitious goals of 10 and even 100 blocks per second. Kaspa’s unique features extend to features like DAG topology querying, data pruning, SPV proofs, and the development of subnetworks for streamlined layer 2 implementations. By prioritizing speed, scalability, and security, Kaspa positions itself as a trailblazer in next-generation cryptocurrency networks, making it a compelling choice for high-throughput financial applications. Conclusion With coins like XRP and KAS offering less short-term potential, DOGEN shines for those seeking luxury and success. Following the path of tokens like BONK and Popcat, it’s expected to grow 700% by presale’s end, with potential for massive returns this altcoin season. DOGEN builds a community of leaders, offering real benefits to early adopters. For more information, visit the official DOGEN website and join the community on X and Telegram .

Trump Cyborg (TRUMPCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCYB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Cyborg launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Cyborg on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Cyborg by entering its contract address – 9yaNQ89EaQ2nEDczZpuTZfDwfiYCxbwSYC4JeiWLDE57 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCYB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-28 18:06:00

In a recent market analysis, Pal called its performance on the weekly chart “astounding,” highlighting bullish technical formations forming around the cryptocurrency. According to Pal, XRP has broken out of a seven-year giant wedge formation, a key technical signal that could signal significant upward momentum. “Look at the weekly chart of XRP, it’s astonishing,” Pal said. “This seven-year giant wedge has broken out. Who knows where this chart is going to go?” Related News: Veteran Analyst il Capo Reveals He's Buying More of This Altcoin After Today's Rally Pal noted the repeated wedge formations in XRP’s price history, noting that XRP has consistently formed similar patterns before breaking higher. “We are currently building another wedge ready for the next high,” he added, suggesting that XRP’s rally may still be in its early stages. While XRP is on the rise, Pal noted that other cryptocurrencies like Sui could also outperform XRP in the near-term. Comparing the two, Pal observed that Sui appears to be gaining traction over XRP based on its own charts. *This is not investment advice.
