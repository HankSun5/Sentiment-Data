This exciting possibility is capturing the attention of the crypto community, sparking speculation about its future success. DOGEN Rejoys Big Moment: Trump’s Victory Will Send It to the Moon Guess who is going to join Elon Musk’s moon mission soon? DOGEN, the boldest meme coin for alpha males, is gearing up for take-off as Trump's victory in the recent US election has the entire market euphoric about the prospects of cryptocurrencies, especially meme coins.

With these two icons fueling the fire, meme coins are set for a wild ride! DOGE Soars 130% in Just One Week!

Flex Hard, Earn Big – DOGEN is Your Power Move! Cardano's ADA: A Sustainable and Scalable Blockchain Platform Cardano is a flexible and scalable blockchain platform designed for smart contracts. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, competes with Ethereum's ETH. Users can store value, make payments, and stake on the Cardano network. Cardano uses the energy-efficient Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, unlike the energy-intensive proof-of-work model. It divides its blockchain into two layers: one for transactions and one for smart contracts. This enhances its ability to process up to a million transactions per second. Cardano tokens, introduced in March 2021, offer secure, low-fee interactions with smart contracts. This sets a new benchmark for blockchain efficiency and scalability. Given its technological advances and sustainable approach, ADA looks attractive in the current market cycle. Polkadot (DOT): Connecting Blockchains for a More Scalable Future Polkadot (DOT) is a decentralized protocol and cryptocurrency that enables secure communication between different blockchains. It allows value and data to be shared across blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin without intermediaries. Polkadot uses parachains to improve speed and scalability, processing more transactions than Bitcoin and Ethereum. The DOT token is used for governance and staking, letting holders participate in development and transaction verification. Developed by Gavin Wood, a co-founder of Ethereum, and launched on May 26, 2020, Polkadot aims to create more interconnected and efficient blockchains. In the current market cycle, Polkadot's technology and potential to enhance blockchain interoperability continue to draw interest. Conclusion In the current bull run, while ADA and DOT have less short-term potential, DOGEN offers massive growth. Designed for those seeking luxury and success, it expects 700% presale growth with potential thousand-fold returns. Following tokens like BONK, DOGEN builds a community of market leaders and offers real value through exclusive perks for early adopters.

SOL, the native cryptocurrency of Solana, is central to its ecosystem, facilitating transactions, running custom programs, and rewarding network participants. The coin holds value by underpinning the operation of the Solana network, allowing users access to a suite of projects.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) , market capitalization’s second-largest meme coin, posted 3% losses in the last 24 hours as the selloff took a sharp turn. Other meme tokens have traded along similar lines, further plunging market sentiments. In the last 24 hours, whales have offloaded huge SHIB tokens, pushing the asset further into the red zone. Crypto analytics firm Lookonchain flagged a huge sale activity. A crypto whale sold 250 billion SHIB tokens worth approximately $6 million, aiming to take profits before further damage. The trader’s SHIB portfolio stands in profit after scooping 15.28 trillion SHIB for $3.8K in August 2020. From that point, the meme coin’s price has soared following bull cycles and mass accumulations from the community. The whale holds $52 million worth of assets after raking in $109 million in profits. This transaction follows previous trends from other whales dumping the asset. On Dec 16, 43 billion tokens were transferred to an unknown wallet, raising community reactions. Meme coins are susceptible to high swings because of prices and market structure. Rally After The Storm Amid a downtrend, meme coins can spark a frenzy on a wider crypto bulk cycle. SHIB bulls remain optimistic for an uphill run, which U.S. institutional investors will likely spark . Before the dip, the asset soared above 90% since the United States elections. Market bulls poured funds into meme coins in expectation of easing regulations in the country, a catalyst to drive the next upward momentum. Similarly, institutional investors also moved assets to reposition ahead of next year’s projections. Crypto enthusiasts investinghaven explained the possibility of a turnaround on X (formerly Twitter). “$ SHIB: 2025 Price Outlook This chart shows Shiba Inu’s price could peak near $0.0000998 in 2025, while the potential low is at $0.0000234. The path to these targets may see volatility, but it reflects broader crypto market trends. Patience could pay off for #SHIB.” Another factor that could spur increased accumulation is the altcoin season . This is characterized by fund flows from Bitcoin to other assets in a cycle. Several analysts have tipped an incoming altcoin season this month as whales move assets to other assets. However, volatility remains a key factor, with recent outflows and dwindling sentiments.",Cryptocurrency|News|SHIB|SHIBA INU,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-27 22:09:15

Focusing on Ripple could be a concerning precedent for future digital asset regulations in the U.S. This battle between the US Securities and Exchange Commission and Ripple Labs is so important in the crypto world that many are concerned with the regulations by the U.S. government toward its digital assets. SEC’s focus on Ripple while overlooking bigger issues Fox Business Reporter Charles Gasparino was critical of other high-profile cases with Sam Bankman-Fried, but the SEC’s action against Ripple and its native cryptocurrency, XRP, got attention. Gasparino argues that the SEC is focusing on Ripple, which may be irrelevant, especially since bigger fish (Sam Bankman) are floating in the finance world. This case has gone far beyond Ripple and is bound to rewrite how the U.S. will continue to regulate its cryptocurrencies from now on. In an interview he said, Ripple Labs and Chief Executive Officer Brad Garlinghouse feel the SEC went too far. They consider the case filed in December 2020 not only an attack on Ripple but also on the cryptocurrency industry at large. Garlinghouse has also voiced his criticism of the SEC, arguing that the case will be a bad precedent for the entire industry. He further argued that the SEC does not know how to regulate cryptocurrency and that it does not appreciate the distinction between digital assets and others. Ripple vs. SEC Ripple reportedly stated its frustration at the SEC’s failure to provide clear guidance on what a company operating in the space of cryptocurrencies and related companies should do in the regulations. Ripple partially won in the court judgment made in 2023 since it ruled that XRP sold on secondary markets cannot be considered a security. The judgment separates XRP from other traditional securities transactions and brings great victory to Ripple. However, the court held that XRP’s direct sales to institutional investors are securities transactions, further pointing to the complexity of the case and the differing nature in which XRP is applied in different contexts. There is an argument that digital assets like XRP must be treated exactly the same way as the real securities inside, with general grounds that protect investors from fraud. Gary Gensler is the SEC chair then. Mr. Gensler maintains that the crypto marketplace should follow securities laws. To him, XRP, among others, has a duty to comply with securities laws for the protection of investors. In fact, the statements released by the company in 2021 have Gensler referring to Bitcoin and Ethereum as commodities but many other tokens and cryptocurrencies as likely being securities and therefore subject to the regulations. According to the SEC, Ripple sales of XRP should be considered securities, whether these are institutional or retail sales, and therefore fall within the same rules of sales that apply to stock and bonds. This being the case, the greater conversation is about how the US government should regulate cryptocurrency. Critics have pointed out the aggressive stance that the SEC has taken towards Ripple.

Ethereum: A Leading Proof-of-Stake Blockchain with Growing Potential Ethereum is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain known for smart contracts and a wide range of decentralized applications. It supports decentralized finance and uses Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon to improve transaction efficiency. Ethereum introduced ERC-20 tokens, which are used across various applications, but transactions still require ETH for gas fees. Since its launch in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum has evolved, transitioning to Proof-of-Stake with the Merge in 2022. The upcoming sharding phase aims to enhance scalability and reduce costs. Ether (ETH) remains central, facilitating transactions and rewarding stakers. Based on historical price movements and BTC halving cycles, Ethereum's price predictions suggest potential growth. These developments may make Ethereum attractive in the current market cycle. XRP: A Fast, Low-Cost Cryptocurrency for Global Transactions XRP is a cryptocurrency that operates on the XRP Ledger. It is designed to be fast, low-cost, and open. XRP allows for borderless transactions that are resistant to censorship and counterfeiting. It does not rely on a central authority, making transactions secure and irreversible. XRP was created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz. They launched it with a supply of 100 billion tokens. Ripple received 80 billion XRP to improve network liquidity and support the ecosystem. Ripple uses XRP to facilitate quick and efficient transfers across different currencies. In the current market cycle, XRP's technology and potential applications may make it an interesting option for global payments. Conclusion As the bull run unfolds, traditional coins like ETH and XRP show less short-term potential. Investors are shifting to DOGEN, a meme token for those seeking luxury and success. Expected to grow 700% by the presale's end with potential for massive returns, DOGEN builds a community of leaders and offers real benefits to early adopters.

The decision to extradite Kwon to the US rather than his native South Korea comes after Montenegro’s Constitutional Court dismissed the disgraced Terra founder’s appeal. Do Kwon To Face Trial In the US One of the most notorious figures in the crypto industry is set to be deported to the United States. The Montenegrin Minister of Justice, Bojan Božović, has approved the extradition of bombastic South Korean entrepreneur Do Kwon, the Ministry announced on Friday. “It was concluded that most of the criteria provided by law support the request for extradition by the competent authorities of the United States of America,” a translated statement from Božović reportedly said, according to news publication Vijesti . This follows a decision from the Constitutional Court of Montenegro earlier this week, which rejected Kwon’s appeal against a previous Supreme Court ruling. In September, the Supreme Court nullified Kwon’s deportation to South Korea and indicated that the Balkan nation’s Minister of Justice would make the final extradition decision. Extradition Nightmare Kwon founded Terraform Labs, popularly known for its algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD (UST) and its sister token LUNA. Both assets imploded in May 2022, wiping out over $40 billion in investor wealth overnight and triggering a chain of bankruptcies throughout the cryptosphere, before its founder went on a run from law enforcement around the world. He was arrested in March 2023 in Montenegro while attempting to travel to Dubai using a fake passport. Since being released from jail this March, Kwon has faced lengthy legal proceedings , with courts deciding between dueling demands to send him to the US or South Korea. The US has been particularly vocal in pursuing his extradition as it seeks to hold him accountable for his role in the shambolic collapse of the Terra ecosystem. Notably, in June, a New York jury found Terraform Labs and Kwon liable for fraud in a lawsuit brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The verdict included six charges, including intentionally misleading investors, misrepresentations about the success and stability of Terra, and “reckless” mishandling of customer money. In June, the controversial company and its once-fugitive founder were fined a whopping $4.5 billion by the SEC after reaching a “settlement in principle”. While it’s not the outcome Kwon was hoping for, signing the order to have him transferred to the United States should hopefully conclude the multi-year legal battle.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News|Terra|USA,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|LUNA|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-27 22:14:39

Make All Your Wishes Come True with the XYZ winning team! Solana (SOL) SOL has seen notable price movements recently. Over the past six months, it has risen by 34.50%. However, in the last month, the price has decreased by 19.60%, including an 8.97% drop in the past week. Currently, SOL is trading between $160.72 and $214.47, reflecting significant volatility. Technical indicators point to potential market trends. SOL is below both its 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages at $189.09 and $190.79, respectively. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 33.48, and the Stochastic oscillator is at 16.54, both suggesting the asset is nearing oversold conditions. The MACD level of -2.081 indicates bearish momentum may continue. Key support and resistance levels are crucial for SOL's price movement. The nearest support level is at $141.08; if the price falls below this, it could test the second support at $87.33. On the upside, breaking through the nearest resistance at $248.58 may propel the price toward the second resistance level of $302. This would represent a substantial percentage gain from current levels. Based on this data, SOL's price could rise if it surpasses resistance levels or fall further if it breaks below support levels. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum (ETH) has experienced notable price movements recently. Over the past week, its price dropped by 8.42%, bringing it within the current range of $2881.83 to $3892.12. The monthly change shows a smaller decline of 2.61%, and over the past six months, ETH has decreased by 1.57%. Technical indicators suggest potential shifts in ETH's price. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 26.14, indicating that the asset is oversold. The Stochastic value is 12.83, supporting this oversold status. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level stands at -33.83, which could signal a forthcoming change in momentum. Both the 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are close, at $3355.12 and $3400.11 respectively, hinting at a consolidation phase. Looking ahead, if ETH manages to surpass the nearest resistance level at $4504, it could aim for the second resistance at $5515, offering potential gains of over 15% and 40% respectively from current levels. Conversely, if it falls below the nearest support at $2483.85, the next support level is at $1473.56, which would represent a significant decrease. Traders are watching these key levels closely, as they may indicate substantial price movements in the near future. Kaspa (KAS) Kaspa (KAS) has been experiencing a noticeable decline in its price recently. Over the past week, the coin's value has dropped by approximately 10.7%. Looking at the monthly performance, it has decreased by about 23.9%. In the last six months, Kaspa has seen a significant reduction of around 36.5% in its price. Currently, KAS is trading in the range of $0.10 to $0.15, indicating a downward trend. The coin is approaching its nearest support level at $0.08. If the price dips below this point, the next support is at $0.0342, which could imply a further decline. On the upside, the immediate resistance level is at $0.18. Surpassing this could lead Kaspa toward the second resistance at $0.22, representing a potential increase of over 45% from its current lower range. Technical indicators suggest mixed signals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is around 30.8, and the Stochastic oscillator is approximately 10.6, both indicating that Kaspa may be entering oversold territory. The Simple Moving Averages for both 10 and 100 days are at $0.12, showing that the price is consolidating around this point. However, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level is negative at -0.001554, hinting at bearish momentum. Based on these factors, Kaspa's price could either continue to decline or potentially rebound if buying interest increases. Conclusion Though SOL, ETH, and KAS are promising, XYZVerse (XYZ), the pioneering all-sport memecoin, offers early adopters growth potential, blending sports enthusiasm with meme culture for significant gains.

38201138,https://zycrypto.com/?p=99437,1735337969,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor Pitches $280 Trillion Crypto Market Capitalization,https://zycrypto.com/microstrategys-michael-saylor-pitches-280-trillion-crypto-market-capitalization/,"MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor has proposed a new framework for digital asset implementation in the United States. This will usher in new growth, with surging adoption tapping an all-time high. Recent activities in the bull cycle have led to uphill projections, although price corrections threaten momentum. In a new document, Saylor rolled out a taxonomy and proposed rights and responsibilities for participants in the crypto space. Notably, this boils down to ramping up activity in the United States and becoming a leader in space. In the run-up to November polls, President-elect Donald Trump restated his stance on the U.S. becoming a global leader in blockchain, Bitcoin, and artificial intelligence. A New All-Time Market Cap? According to the document, US participation in the crypto market will strengthen its position and lead to fresh capital inflow. Specifically, the total digital capital market is estimated to soar from $2 trillion to $280 trillion, with US investors dominating the scene. Saylor asserted that this would strengthen the dollar and reduce the national debt. Following Donald Trump’s win, institutional investors recorded massive inflows, taking the market cap above $3 trillion. This pushed the price of Bitcoin above $90K and eventually tapped $107K as buying intensified. Although the market faced slight sell pressures, traders looked to pro-market regulations as Republicans control both houses of Congress. Inflows are expected to drive global adoption, taking the market cap to an all-time high. The main instrument for the upswing is a Bitcoin strategic reserve. Tipped by most stakeholders, it is expected to attract bulls and help the county lower its debt. US Senator Cynthia Lummis proposed a bill that will see the country acquire 1 million BTC per year to be held for at least 20 years. Lummis proposes selling gold reserves to fund Bitcoin purchases. Saylor also noted that digital asset growth without Bitcoin is expected to notch inflows. A Path To Clear Rules Although sentiments have largely flipped positive following the advancement of pro-crypto bills, much effort is still required to bring the US into line with other jurisdictions. Per the document, Saylor seeks a clear framework for issuers, owners, and crypto exchanges to avoid the plethora of lawsuits previously recorded. “ Path to Legitimacy: Establish a global, real-time, and uninterrupted process for issuing, trading, and owning digital assets by individuals, corporations, and machines. Issuers: Rights: The right to create and issue digital assets. Responsibilities: Ensure fair disclosure and ethical behavior. Exchanges: Rights: The right to custody, trade, and transfer assets between clients and other exchanges. Responsibilities: Publish asset disclosures, protect client assets, and avoid conflicts of interest,” the document reads.",Cryptocurrency|Featured|News|Michael Saylor|MicroStrategy,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-27 22:19:29

With the potential of Solana, the popularity of Dogecoin, and the rise of XYZVerse, these digital currencies might spark the next big movement by 2025. What developments could position them at the forefront of the industry's resurgence? Trump's Victory Sparks Crypto Chaos: $XYZ Meme Coin Ready to Deliver a 99,900% Knockout Donald Trump’s election victory has triggered a seismic shift in the crypto market, setting the stage for a bull run like no other. As the dust settles, major coins limp forward with uninspiring double-digit gains, while meme coins are stealing the show. PNUT’s recent 4,500% surge? FRED’s 6,000% explosion? Ancient history, buried in the ashes of short-lived hype. These coins buckled under selling pressure, leaving FOMO-ridden investors licking their wounds. But the crypto battlefield doesn’t wait for the weak — a new titan has emerged with plans to obliterate profit records and deliver an earth-shaking 99,900% surge. Take the XYZ Side - The Undisputed Champion of Meme Coins $XYZ Breaks into the Ring to Knockout Meme Coin Legends Meet $XYZ - the first-ever all-sports memecoins for true crypto degens hungry for 1000X profits. This is the token for those who thrive on the thrill of competition. As Trump takes the reins, the crypto market is set to erupt so the competition is getting fierce. Only the strongest tokens can survive in this no-mercy arena. Here comes the dawn of a crypto era for those with balls of steel — the guys like Joe Rogan and Dana White — who’d proudly rally behind Trump’s team. With such true men of business on board, there is no place for old pussy meme coins, it's time for real brutal coins. Fueled by the sports mentality, the $XYZ token has emerged as the ultimate contender ready to crush competitors and rocket to the moon on Elon Musk’s mission. $XYZ is on its way to the winner's podium to become a badge of honor for those who live and breathe sports and crypto. $XYZ Already Delivers Even Before Hitting the Market The $XYZ presale is underway, providing access to the token at a special pre-listing price. Launch Price: $0.0001 Price Now: $0.001333 In just a couple of months, $XYZ already soared over 1330%!

The $XYZ presale is already smashing through stages with the speed of a champion’s knockout blow. Join $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions! Solana (SOL) SOL has seen notable price movements recently. Over the past six months, it has risen by 34.50%. However, in the last month, the price has decreased by 19.60%, including an 8.97% drop in the past week. Currently, SOL is trading between $160.72 and $214.47, reflecting significant volatility. Technical indicators point to potential market trends. SOL is below both its 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages at $189.09 and $190.79, respectively. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 33.48, and the Stochastic oscillator is at 16.54, both suggesting the asset is nearing oversold conditions. The MACD level of -2.081 indicates bearish momentum may continue. Key support and resistance levels are crucial for SOL's price movement. The nearest support level is at $141.08; if the price falls below this, it could test the second support at $87.33. On the upside, breaking through the nearest resistance at $248.58 may propel the price toward the second resistance level of $302. This would represent a substantial percentage gain from current levels. Based on this data, SOL's price could rise if it surpasses resistance levels or fall further if it breaks below support levels. Dogecoin (DOGE) Over the past week, Dogecoin has fallen by 12.79%, extending a month-long drop of 20.41%. Despite this downward trend, the meme-based cryptocurrency boasts a six-month gain of 153.49%. This contrast highlights its volatile nature, offering significant returns over the long term even amid short-term losses. Technical indicators suggest Dogecoin might be oversold. The Relative Strength Index is at 28.36, and the Stochastic oscillator stands at 16.03—both below typical oversold thresholds. Additionally, the 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are converging at $0.32, indicating potential price stabilization or a reversal. Looking ahead, Dogecoin faces resistance at $0.48 and stronger resistance at $0.63. Breaking through these levels could signal substantial upside, potentially leading to double-digit percentage gains. On the downside, support lies at $0.18, with a deeper support level at $0.0257. If prices slip below these points, further declines may follow. Traders are watching these key levels to gauge Dogecoin's next move. Conclusion With SOL, DOGE, and the innovative XYZVerse uniting sports fans and meme culture, these coins are poised to lead the crypto market's surge into 2025.

Buterin’s Christmas gift will go toward upgrading the zoo’s facilities and supporting its Wildlife Sponsorship program. Crypto Meets Conservation In a letter addressed to Khao Kheow’s director shared on X, the Russian-born programmer explained that his involvement stemmed from a recent visit to the facility, where he was captivated by its commitment to animal welfare and community engagement. He thanked the zoo for welcoming him and highlighted Moo Deng’s unique role as a cultural ambassador for Thailand. Buterin praised the animal sanctuary’s efforts and reiterated the importance of improving the pygmy hippo habitat. He also acknowledged Thailand’s hospitality to the Ethereum community, especially during Devcon SEA in Bangkok last November. The 30-year-old said he would donate no less than 10 million baht, approximately $300,000 in Moo Deng’s name, to be delivered in two installments. The first contribution was made on December 26, with the date for the second set to be communicated later. Buterin has also promised an extra 88 ETH to ensure ongoing support for the zoo’s projects. Earlier, the establishment had posted on X expressing its appreciation for the Ethereum developer’s generosity, calling him “an adoptive father to Moo Deng.” He responded, sharing his enthusiasm for the role and quoting a popular line from the Star Trek shows: “May they live long and prosper.” Market Performance Moo Deng, already a beloved symbol in Thailand, gained global fame as the face of the MOODENG coin. The token has captured the crypto community’s attention despite recent market fluctuations. At the time of this writing, it was changing hands at $0.2693, with a 24-hour trading volume of $179.7 million, representing a 50.3% surge in activity compared to the previous day. While the token’s price dipped 3.2% in the past 24 hours, it gained 6.1% over the past week, outperforming the broader crypto market, which had seen a 1.2% decline in that period. Buterin previously liquidated over $1 million worth of meme tokens donated to him, including 10 billion MOODENG, giving the proceeds to various charities. Interestingly, he was recently critical of the meme coin space, decrying the proliferation of celebrity-inspired tokens. He argued that it would be better if they had a public goal aimed at promoting a specific cause or at least incorporated fun mechanics going beyond trading.

Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) PNUT is a fresh, meme-inspired cryptocurrency token making waves on the Solana blockchain. With a total supply of 100 million tokens, it boasts zero transaction taxes, a revoked contract, and a burnt liquidity pool. These features aim to ensure the security and safety of holders' assets. The token's mascot, Pnut, is a cheerful squirrel reminiscent of popular meme characters, adding a light-hearted and community-driven spirit to the project. For those interested, acquiring PNUT is straightforward through platforms like Jupiter Aggregator. In today's ever-changing crypto market, PNUT offers a unique blend of fun and practicality. Its presence on Solana means fast transactions and low fees, which could appeal to many users. The zero transaction taxes make trading PNUT more attractive compared to other tokens that have additional costs. While the crypto market is unpredictable, PNUT's engaging approach and solid technology might help it stand out among other meme coins. With the growing interest in community-focused projects, PNUT could be an interesting option for enthusiasts watching current market trends. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) PENGU is the official coin of Pudgy Penguins, a vibrant community that has become the face of crypto. From big brands sporting the Penguin to appearances in ETF commercials, the Pudgy Penguin has soared in popularity. With millions of followers and over 50 billion views, it's more than just an image—it's a cultural icon.

To surpass the S&P 500. The logic is as bold as it is simple: 6900 is greater than 500, so SPX6900 must be superior. This playful reasoning has caught the attention of many who believe that bigger numbers might just mean better investments. But how does SPX6900 fare in today's market? As cryptocurrencies evolve, meme tokens like SPX6900 are gaining traction. They offer a fun twist compared to traditional coins.

Its AI-generated concept has captured the imagination of investors and crypto enthusiasts alike. As the market seeks fresh and novel projects, Turbo Token's AI heritage could give it an edge over traditional memecoins. While the volatility of cryptocurrencies remains a factor, the blending of AI technology with blockchain might signal a new trend worth watching. Compared to other tokens, Turbo's innovative background may make it an intriguing option for those interested in the intersection of AI and finance.

38202219,https://invezz.com/?p=2407689,1735338403,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Pig butchering crypto scams cost users $3.6 billion this year,https://invezz.com/news/2024/12/27/pig-butchering-crypto-scams-cost-users-3-6-billion-this-year/,"Pig butchering scams were the leading attack vector for the cryptocurrency space in 2024, resulting in multi-billion dollar losses for millions of investors. According to data from web3 security firm Cyver’s annual fraud report, scammers managed to dupe crypto users out of a whopping $3.6 billion this year, with the attacks spanning over 150,000 addresses and 800,000 transactions. The number, while significant, presents a slight drop in losses compared to the previous year, when roughly $3.96 billion was lost to similar schemes. What are pig butchering scams? Often involving sophisticated social engineering tactics, pig butchering scams are long-term fraud schemes that thrive on emotional manipulation, fake credibility, and the promise of high returns, making them one of the most insidious threats in the cryptocurrency space. The term ‘pig butchering’ has been derived from the practice of fattening a pig before slaughter, similar to how scammers build trust and rapport with their targets over weeks or even months. Fraudsters approach victims in various ways. Sometimes, they pose as romantic interests, sometimes as financial mentors, and gradually coax victims into fishy crypto investments that are too good to be true. Victims are usually led to fake trading platforms where they often see manipulated dashboards that display impressive returns to gain their trust and encourage investments. Once the victim is fully invested, the scammer disappears with the funds, leaving victims with little recourse and often no way to recover their losses. However, in a rare turn of events last month, the Federal Bureau of Investigation recovered $8.3 million connected to a pig butchering scheme. The case involved the former chief executive of Heartland Tri-State Bank, who misappropriated $47.1 million in customer funds, which ultimately led to the bank’s collapse. With pig butchering scams becoming increasingly common, authorities all across the globe have increased efforts to track and dismantle these often large criminal networks. Earlier this month, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission in Nigeria arrested 792 suspects allegedly involved in orchestrating pig butchering scams. Cyber attacks on the rise However, pig butchering scams are merely the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the various types of threats that plague the cryptocurrency industry. The Cyvers report notes that hacking attacks targeting the sector jumped 40% compared to last year, with access control breaches and smart contract vulnerabilities causing the most damage. As previously reported by Invezz, a separate report from security firm Hacken also highlights a similar trend. Notably, the centralized finance sector was the most affected, with private key compromises and weak access controls emerging as primary vulnerabilities, contributing to 75% of all exploits in 2024. Besides the aforementioned schemes, phishing attacks remain another persistent threat to crypto users. Since cryptocurrencies are inherently digital and transactions occur entirely online, the ecosystem remains highly vulnerable to such attacks. Even though such losses have been steadily declining over the past months, the complex and stealthy nature of the attack makes it a common weapon in the crypto scammer’s arsenal. For instance, on December 26, scammers were seen exploiting Google ads to distribute crypto-stealing phishing scripts while mimicking the Pugy Penguins project website with the malicious content hosted on the Adloox tracking domain.

Shiba Inu (SHIB): Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Expanding Utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a memecoin inspired by Dogecoin but built on the Ethereum blockchain. Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi, SHIB started with a quadrillion tokens. Half of the tokens were sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin, who donated and burned large amounts, increasing SHIB's visibility. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB's Ethereum base allows for applications like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange. There are plans for a future NFT platform and a DAO-based governance system. This integration with Ethereum's ecosystem gives SHIB potential for broader utility. In the current market cycle, SHIB's developments may attract interest due to its expanding features. Conclusion Coins like SHIB may have less short-term potential, while Catzilla aims to bring financial freedom to everyone. Offering a 700% ROI potential during its presale, the token starts at $0.0002 and rises to $0.0016 over 14 stages. With governance features, loyalty rewards, and staking options, Catzilla invites enthusiasts to join its mission against crypto villains.

After the holidays, the asset manager becomes one of the biggest Ethereum (ETH) whales after copping 993,591.95 ETH. This is equivalent to $3.5 billion worth of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. BlackRock Benefits from Spot Ethereum ETF BlackRock achieved this feat through its ETH Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) with the ticker ETHA. As of December 27, the firm’s Ethereum holding represents 0.12% of Ethereum’s total supply. Consequently, BlackRock has risen to become the world’s 12th-largest altcoin holder. This marks a laudable feat for a firm whose history with Ethereum began only this year. Contextually, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot Ethereum ETF applications made by eight firms, including BlackRock, in July 2024 after a long wait . Ethereum Price Struggles Post-ETF Approval Since the approval of the funds, Ethereum has had a good time in terms of growth. In addition, Donald Trump’s victory in the last United States elections held in November also contributed to the price rally. At this writing, Ethereum traded at $3,313.42 after losing 1% of its 24-hour price gain. The altcoin has been stuck between critical psychological levels in the last few weeks. According to crypto analyst Rekt Capital, it has struggled to break above the $4,000 mark . The coin passed this threshold in the past and peaked at $4,077 on December 6. There are speculations that Ethereum could slip further down to the point of losing up to 10% of its current price level. BlackRock IBIT Records Largest Outflow BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF has also recorded a lot of success this past few weeks, although it hit a roadblock recently. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) recorded its biggest outflow just a day before Christmas. This coincided with when the United States spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded four straight days of withdrawals, with over $1.5 billion missing. On Wednesday, IBIT made headlines because of a large outflow of $188.7 million . This was the largest that the fund had seen since its inception. In the coming weeks, which coincides with Donald Trump’s entry into office, the outlook of these funds may improve.

Related Reading: Dogecoin 600% Rally Prediction Still On Track Before End Of 2024 — Analyst According to recent studies, historical price fluctuations show that the popular meme coin may experience another parabolic boom. Dogecoin has been notorious for its wild price swings, and many predict that the coming year will be critical to its progress. Historical Patterns Suggest Potential Gains Dogecoin has had a history of sharp price increases followed by declines. For instance, in 2017 it rose 210% prior to reversing, then suddenly jumped 5,000%. In 2021, it followed a pattern, initially rising 476% before a significant reversal that ended with an astonishing increase of 12,000%. Dogecoin is now up around 440% over the last year, but has lately had a 46% pullback. Analysts believe that this repeated pattern implies a potential significant rally. Dogecoin Bullish Forecasts For 2025 Many analysts have made quite optimistic projections on the course Dogecoin’s price might take over 2025. While some have ranged within $1 and $3, others have pegged it as high as $10. Investments CEO said in a post on Christmas Day that Dogecoin would repeat its fourth-year cyclical performance. At the same time, he said that the meme coin’s rise would be better compared to that of 2021. A MASSIVE rally is coming for $DOGE, MUCH bigger than the one in 2021. Are you prepared? pic.twitter.com/auBAw7XMMn — CEO (@Investments_CEO) December 25, 2024 Meanwhile, some likely involvement from Elon Musk may be another crucial point, who is probably going to have a key role to play in the meme coin community sometime in the next year. His influence will probably create just the ideal atmosphere for Dogecoin to reach new highs. According to analyst Javon Marks, Dogecoin may surge as high as 600%, reaching approximately $2.28 based on past trends and market behavior. He says that previous cycles have followed similar patterns, leading to huge price increases. Market Sentiment And Future Outlook Despite recent volatility in the market and some bearish pressures, analysts still believe in Dogecoin’s bright future. The cryptocurrency market has recently been very volatile, and yet most of the analysts still predict that when bitcoin will stabilize and start surging again, Dogecoin will be sure to do the same. More than 140% gain of the Dogecoin’s price, taking the currency above $0.8023 is predicted once bitcoin reverses its down move.

Cardano, which has a market capitalization of $31.4 billion, and Ripple’s XRP, with a market capitalization of $123 billion, could be planning to enter into a symbiotic relationship. Cardano’s founder, Charles Hoskinson , has aroused discussions about adding XRP to Cardano’s privacy-focused Midnight sidechain. XRP in Cardano’s Midnight? Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, has hinted at the likelihood of partnering with Ripple. He suggested that the Midnight sidechain focused on privacy could include XRP in the project. The discussion also covered Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin as a potential addition to Cardano’s ecosystem. Hoskinson also mentioned that he had been holding talks with Ripple CTO David Schwartz as well as the company’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse. “Dave Schwartz is a great guy. He’s a brilliant guy. It’s a lot of fun being in meetings with him, and I love to hang out with him,” Hoskinson stated. Ripple’s resilience amid its legal battles with the U.S. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) impressed Hoskinson. The court case between Ripple and the SEC started in December 2020. Through XRP, the SEC alleged that Ripple sold securities without receiving prior approval. In July of 2023, the federal court ruled that XRP is not a security when traded in public platforms, among other things. However, unfavorable penalties and appeal proceedings continue to exert regulatory pressure on Ripple. In a recent live stream , Hoskinson even boasted about how well the company is run to deal with lawsuits, delistings, and regulation. Despite setbacks, Ripple remains a key player in the crypto space. Hoskinson also discussed using XRP in Midnight. This sidechain is built to focus on privacy within decentralized applications. He also mentioned that Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin could work in many ways for Cardano’s ecosystem. Hoskinson’s Budding Relationship with Ripple The Cardano founder’s comments show a shift in his stance toward Ripple. He previously publicly apologized to the XRP community on November 10. Collaboration talks suggest Ripple and Cardano may align on privacy and smart contract innovations. Ripple remains a top crypto player. XRP is the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, with a $31.4 billion market cap as of Dec. 27 (CoinMarketCap). Despite legal challenges, Ripple continues to push forward with new initiatives. The discussions signal a potential alliance between Ripple and Cardano . This could create new opportunities in blockchain privacy and stablecoin integration if realized. Both sides remain in talks as they navigate the evolving crypto landscape.",Cryptocurrency|Featured|News|ADA|Cardano|Charles Hoskinson|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,ADA|MARKET|REGULATION|SPONSORED|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-27 22:34:38

Ethena (ENA) Eyes Breakout as Altcoin Season Approaches Ethena (ENA) is showing promising signs amid growing optimism for an upcoming altcoin season. Despite a recent dip of -12.95% over the past week, ENA has surged 48.75% in the last month and an impressive 83.34% over six months. The RSI stands at 28.24, indicating oversold conditions, while the stochastic at 6.97 suggests potential upward momentum. With the current price hovering between $0.81 and $1.29, breaking above the nearest resistance at $1.55 could open the path to the second resistance at $2.04. This move could represent a significant gain from current levels. The SMA for 10-days is below the 100-days SMA, hinting at a possible trend reversal. ENA might be poised for substantial growth. Movement (MOVE) Soars: Nearly 1000% Monthly Gain Signals Bullish Momentum Movement (MOVE) has soared nearly 1000% in the past month, showcasing strong bullish momentum. This week alone, the price surged over 72%. Trading between $0.57 and $1.11, MOVE is approaching its nearest resistance at $1.39. A break above this level could see it targeting $1.93, offering significant gains. The Relative Strength Index sits at 43, suggesting there's room for growth before hitting overbought levels. The Stochastic oscillator indicates oversold conditions, hinting at a potential price rebound. With the 100-day Simple Moving Average at $0.94, Movement appears poised for continued growth in the upcoming altcoin season. Conclusion SHIRO, ENA, and MOVE show promise but may have less short-term potential. Catzilla, the ultimate meme coin hero, offers a 700% ROI potential during its presale.

Emerging blockchain platforms are poised to revolutionize the market by the year 2025. This article explores the innovative technologies that are expected to drive the next significant surge in digital currencies. Delve into the developments that could reshape the future of crypto and potentially transform the global financial system. Graphite Token (@G): Powering the Blockchain That Could Topple Ethereum and Solana Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) have had their time in the spotlight. Now, Graphite Token (@G) is here, bringing with it the power of the Graphite L1 blockchain designed to make crypto simpler, faster, and more rewarding for everyone. Could this be the next big thing to follow Ethereum’s legendary 4,000X growth? The secret to life-changing crypto profits lies in spotting the next hidden gem before the crowd. History shows that early adopters of projects with real utility reap massive rewards: Solana started at $0.04 and skyrocketed to nearly $300 — a staggering +7,500%. Ethereum launched below $1 and climbed to around $4,000 — an insane +400,000%. The secret to their growth? Utility. The more people use them, the more valuable their tokens become. But times have changed, and these blockchains aren’t cutting it anymore. Discover SOL and ETH Challenger for 4,000X Profit Potential What’s Wrong with Ethereum and Solana? Older blockchains face growing challenges like rising fees, complexity, regulatory uncertainty, and questions about reliability. Take Solana, which occasionally experiences network outages, or Ethereum, which saw a significant reduction in its burn rate in 2024. Between unpredictable gas costs, unsatisfactory speed, and unreliable service, users are starting to look elsewhere. The dominance of the “old guard” is fading. What Graphite Brings to the Table Graphite is built to address the challenges of older blockchains with a set of practical features. Direct Rewards for Entry-Point Nodes Graphite has something no other blockchain offers. It lets entry-point nodes earn 50% of transaction fees passing through their nodes, so literally anyone contributing to its operations can earn a share. Transparent, Trust-Based Interactions Graphite’s reputation-based system introduces a Trust Score, a measure of user credibility similar to a credit rating in TradFi. This approach enhances transparency while keeping user privacy within the network where interactions are built on trust. Fair Fees, Fast Speed, and High Scalability Powered by the PoA Polymer 2.0 Algorithm, Graphite keeps fees plain and as low as possible by minimizing computational and energy costs. The network processes up to 1,400 transactions per second with confirmation times under 10 seconds, delivering a perfect balance of speed, cost-efficiency, and reliability. Security as a Top Priority Graphite enforces a one user - one account policy to safeguard its network against fraud and scams. Additionally, it offers an optional KYC verification procedure with three tiers of off-chain checks powered by ZKP to ensure compliance while protecting user data. With transaction filters, users can choose to interact only with accounts that meet specific KYC levels, adding an extra layer of security. Is This Your Chance to Get in Early? The Graphite blockchain is secure, transparent, scalable, and cost-efficient, making it the go-to choice for developers and users alike. With its practical approach and early adoption potential, Graphite is a project worth watching. For those looking to get in early, Graphite offers an opportunity to be part of a blockchain that’s designed for long-term growth and usability. Will it deliver 4,000X gains? Time will tell, but the foundation is strong. This could be your shot at 4,000X profits — Don’t miss out! ARB Token: Empowering Ethereum with Arbitrum's Layer-2 Scaling ARB is the token powering Arbitrum, a Layer-2 solution for Ethereum developed by Offchain Labs. Arbitrum enhances Ethereum by increasing transaction speed, scalability, and privacy. It uses optimistic rollups to improve smart contract performance and lower execution costs. ARB serves as a governance token, allowing holders to vote on network decisions and participate in ecosystem development. The initial supply is 10 billion tokens, with a maximum yearly inflation rate of 2%. Distribution includes allocations to investors, DAOs, individual wallets, a DAO Treasury, and the team and advisors. The Arbitrum DAO oversees any changes in token allocation. Solana (SOL): Exploring a Scalable Blockchain for Decentralized Apps Solana is a blockchain platform that focuses on scalability. It provides a foundation for decentralized applications, similar to Ethereum and Cardano. Solana stands out because of its architecture designed for fast transactions and flexible development across many programming languages. SOL is the native cryptocurrency of Solana. It plays a central role in the ecosystem. Users can use SOL to facilitate transactions, run custom programs, and reward network supporters. The SOL coin holds value because it underpins the operation of the Solana ecosystem. It rewards participants and allows access to various projects. Solana avoids sharding or second-layer solutions for scalability. Its high-capacity network aims to attract developers and investors by hosting high-activity products and services. AVAX: Avalanche's Eco-Friendly Blockchain with High Transaction Capacity AVAX is the native token of Avalanche, a Layer-1 blockchain known for its low fees and quick transaction processing. The platform uses a hybrid consensus mechanism that combines classical and Nakamoto principles, aiming to finalize transactions in less than two seconds. Avalanche features three interoperable chains—the X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain—that handle various functions like transactions and smart contracts. AVAX plays a central role in the ecosystem, used for transaction fees, securing the network through staking, and operating multiple Subnets. This utility supports payments, staking rewards, and the creation of custom tokens and blockchains within the network. Conclusion In conclusion, while coins like ARB, SOL, and AVAX show promise, they may have less potential in the short term. The Graphite Token (@G) powers the innovative Graphite L1 blockchain, aiming to simplify crypto and deliver unmatched speed and rewards. It tackles issues like Ethereum's high fees and Solana's network outages by offering fair transaction costs and a Trust Score system based on reputation. A unique reward model allows entry-point nodes to earn 50% of transaction fees, encouraging active participation. With strong security through Polymer 2.0 and optional KYC verification, Graphite sets new standards for blockchain reliability. For early adopters, it presents an exciting opportunity to engage with a project built for long-term growth. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

Winter Pepe (PEPEWINT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEWINT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Winter Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Winter Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Winter Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Winter Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Winter Pepe by entering its contract address – CUreLFB9SJmu6WEpotjmLJgt1khhdpneukDRJsbXFCGM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

In its 2024 Web3 Security Report, Hacken says that the theft of private crypto keys remains the most “significant” threat to crypto investors. According to Hacken, the number of smart contract exploits pale in comparison to how often private crypto keys are stolen. “In 2024, access control exploits – closely tied to private key compromises – accounted for nearly of total crypto hack losses, up from 50% in 2023. This translates to nearly lost across Web3, a sharp increase from less than $1 billion the previous year. 75% $1.7 billion In comparison, smart contract vulnerability exploits contributed just 14% of the total losses in 2024, underscoring the dominant threat posed by unauthorized access and private key theft.” Private keys are strings of letters, words, and numbers generated by crypto wallets used to authorize transactions and prove ownership. They help encrypt data and assets to protect them from being stolen. The cybersecurity firm goes on to note four reasons why people tend to get their private keys stolen – using an insecure management platform, being tricked by social engineering campaigns, insecure backups of data, and vulnerabilities within single-signature schemes of crypto wallets. According to Hacken, the largest exploit of 2024 was the hack of centralized Indian crypto exchange WazirX, which saw over $230 million worth of digital assets stolen. “Despite employing a robust multiparty security system, the exchange suffered a breach due to unauthorized fund movements from their wallets. WazirX utilized a Gnosis Safe multisig wallet requiring 4 out of 6 signatures for transactions. Five of the keys were managed by WazirX, while the sixth was held by Liminal, a digital asset custody provider. The attacker managed to manipulate the system, obtaining signatures from three WazirX signers and one from Liminal, allowing them to upgrade the wallet to a malicious contract and siphon off the funds.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Egrar Crypto, a technical analyst whose X account is followed by nearly 70,000 fans people, emphasized that Ripple could deliver much higher gains than Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH) during this stage of the bull market. #XRP – Will Outperform #ETH and #BTC – The Secret Is Under the Hood! #XRP Market Cap Window = $619.61B – $1.56T Ready How and Why. This post focuses on XRP's Dominance and its Market Cap potential, revealing why it has a much higher multiplier than both ETH and BTC.… pic.twitter.com/7CbaGlPxjr — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 25, 2024 He first shared an assessment of how XRP’s dominance has been evolving lately, moving from as little as 1% to over 5% in the past four years, primarily as a result of the legal victory that Ripple had in its case against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). He went on to predict that a break above the 0.5 Fibonacci level – typically interpreted as a bullish signal – could propel XRP’s dominance to 11.44%. Given that the combined value of cryptocurrencies currently stands at $3.28 trillion, that would mean XRP’s market value could be propelled to $375 million on short notice if that scenario unfolds as Egrar Crypto expects. This would result in 3X gains for XRP holders based on the token’s current market cap. However, Egrar predicts that the total market cap of cryptos could surge to $5.42 trillion once alt-coin season starts, meaning that reaching the 11.44% dominance level would mean a total market cap of $620 billion or 5X gains for XRP investors. Although past performance is not a guarantee of future outcomes, the trend for XRP dominance is currently on an upward path. If its ascent continues, these are plausible targets that could be reached in the medium term. XRP at $4 Before Year End is a Real Possibility From a technical standpoint, the $4 area is a feasible target that XRP could reach once the market shakes off the latest pullback and late buyers enter the scene to add more fuel to the rally. The post-election uptick that the crypto market experienced is interpreted by analysts as the first wave in what could be a prolonged climb for digital assets as multiple tailwinds including Donald Trump’s victory in the November U.S. presidential election and the Federal Reserve’s commitment to keep lowering rates are favoring higher prices for risky assets like cryptos. XRP has been the most favored asset of this rally of all the top 10 cryptocurrencies as it experienced a 253% uptick since a court of law ruled in favor of the company in its long-standing legal rift against the SEC. The robustness of the XRP network and the active involvement of its C-level officers along with a strong community of die-hard backers who have accompanied the project despite the many challenges it has faced could make XRP become a powerhouse in the cross-border payments, decentralized finance (DeFi) , and smart contracts segments. The launch of the stablecoin RLUSD is a step forward for the project to keep expanding its reach. During the latest pullback, XRP has found support at around $1.95 per token. This is the most critical area to watch moving forward. As long as it holds, it could serve as a launching pad once alt-season kicks in. The short-term target of $4 seems attainable and this would result in XRP doubling its market cap. However, the target shared by Egrar Crypto provides a longer-term view of the potential of this cryptocurrency to keep expanding its footprint in the crypto market.

Both said they would prefer to see how other countries – such as the USA – develop Bitcoin reserves before taking action. In Japan, the government issued a statement in response to a question from a lawmaker who suggested the state begin stockpiling BTC . And in Moscow, the nation’s Finance Minister stated that Russia would be “better off keeping” its “powder dry.” Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba (left), Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov (right); (Sources: Ogiyoshisan ;Kremlin.ru [CC BY-SA 3.0; CC BY 4.0] Japan, Russia: No Bitcoin Reserve Plans On December 11, the Japanese lawmaker Satoshi Hamada asked for the government’s opinion on his claim that “Japan should follow the example of the United States and other countries.” Hamada urged Tokyo to “consider converting part of its foreign exchange reserves into cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.” In a government release published on the Japanese House of Councillors’ website , Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’s office stated that it does not yet “have a detailed understanding of developments in the United States and other countries.” Ishiba’s office said that plans to roll out a national Bitcoin reserve in the US and elsewhere were “still in their early stages.” As such, the PM’s team said, it is still “difficult for the government to express a view” on the matter.

And the PM’s team wrote that existing foreign currency reserves are only “intended to stabilize Japan’s foreign currency-denominated assets and foreign currency bond markets.” The government added that the “volatility of cryptoassets, including Bitcoin,” made them “incompatible with the current system.” The Japanese media outlet CoinPost wrote that the “official response from Prime Minister Ishiba” once again “demonstrates that the Japanese government is maintaining a cautious stance” on crypto. Ishiba has made a series of cagey remarks on crypto adoption in recent weeks . These include non-committal and conservative comments on possible crypto tax reforms and Bitcoin spot ETF approval. The outlet wrote that Ishiba’s comments come “amid ongoing discussions both at home and abroad about using crypto as a national reserve asset.” No Russian BTC Reserve? Meanwhile, Russia’s RBC reported that Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told a student audience at the state-run Financial University that “the issue of creating a cryptocurrency reserve could be considered in the future,” but noted that the matter was not currently on the table.

However, there is also a risk of loss. So the state does not take those kinds of financial risks. Not at all. It is better to earn less, but keep – as they say – your powder dry,” Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov Siluanov added that despite the rapid growth in BTC prices this year, “cryptocurrencies are less predictable today than other assets.” However, he added: “Maybe someday, we will come around to the idea of [building a national Bitcoin reserve]. The Americans are talking about this now. They are talking about using crypto as a national reserve asset. But since crypto is a very volatile instrument, investing a sovereign state’s funds in something so [unpredictable] is probably dangerous.” Trump Ready to Act US President-elect Donald Trump has spoken about launching state-operated BTC reserve on multiple occasions. ‘Crazy worked just fine the first time’: Why some Republicans see Trump’s imperialist musings as an act of negotiation. https://t.co/WXlPZ4eDle — POLITICO (@politico) December 26, 2024 American lawmakers have already prepared the ground for this, crafting a bill that would prepare the legal framework for such a move.

This widespread dip in altcoin prices is largely tied to Bitcoin's dominance (BTC.D), which currently sits at a high 58.1%. What is BTC.D and Why Does It Matter? Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) is the percentage of the total cryptocurrency market made up by Bitcoin. When BTC.D is high, it means most of the money in the market is flowing into Bitcoin rather than altcoins. This often happens during times of uncertainty, as investors see Bitcoin as a safer bet compared to smaller coins.For altcoins to thrive, BTC.D needs to go down. A lower BTC.D signals that investors are moving funds into smaller altcoins, which drives their prices up. Historically, BTC.D starts to drop in the first quarter of a new year. When this happens, it usually kicks off an ""altcoin season,"" where altcoins grow much faster than Bitcoin.That means altcoins such as $WIF, $BONK, $ETH, $SOL, and $SHIB will likely start moving to the upside significantly. However, to maximize gains, it’s essential to pick the highest winners. Among the most promising winners for the upcoming altcoin season, experts highlight Altura ($ALU) as a standout project. Why Altura ($ALU) Could Be the Star of Altcoin Season One of the most exciting projects to watch during the next altcoin season is Altura($ALU). Altura is an AI-driven cryptocurrency that’s focused on revolutionizing the NFT and gaming world. By using artificial intelligence, Altura offers cutting-edge solutions that are catching the attention of both crypto and tech enthusiasts.Currently, Altura is only at a $100 million market cap, making it an undervalued gem. A 10x growth would mean reaching just a $1 billion market cap, which is considered achievable given the rapid growth of the AI and gaming industries. These industries are expanding at an incredible pace, and Altura’s unique role in both sectors gives it a strong chance to succeed.What makes Altura special is not just its innovative approach but also its potential for massive returns. Experts predict it could deliver gains as high as 10x to 20x for early investors. While other coins may also rise during altcoin season, they might not provide the same explosive returns as Altura . Its focus on two of the fastest-growing industries—AI and gaming—positions it as a leader in the space. Final Thoughts The current struggles in the altcoin market are closely tied to Bitcoin's dominance. As long as BTC.D stays high, altcoins are likely to remain under pressure. However, history shows that this trend doesn’t last forever. Once BTC.D starts to decline, altcoin season can begin, creating exciting opportunities for smaller coins.For investors looking to maximize their returns, keeping an eye on promising projects like Altura ($ALU) is essential. With its strong use of AI and its position in the rapidly growing NFT and gaming sectors, Altura could lead the next wave of altcoin growth and deliver impressive returns in the coming months. Its low current market cap makes it a prime candidate for explosive gains, offering a rare opportunity in the crypto market. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Currently, the Bitcoin price is retesting the support line of an Ascending Channel after crashing below $95,000. A crypto analyst has predicted that if it can hold this key support level, it could stage a recovery and skyrocket to its next bullish target, aligning with the upper resistance line of the channel. Bitcoin Price Retest Support Line; New Target In Sight In a chart illustrating Bitcoin’s price movement within an Ascending Channel, Trader Tardigrade, a crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), revealed that the cryptocurrency has temporarily declined below the lower support line on the channel. The analyst labeled this decline a “False Break,” highlighting that the Ascending Channel remains intact despite the drop. Related Reading: Ethereum Total Value Locked Reaches Highest Level Since 2022 After Crossing $90 Billion, Will Price Follow? As indicated by the red circle in the price chart, the False Break suggests that Bitcoin’s brief move below the support level was short-lived and does not confirm the continuation of its previous downtrend. Trader Tardigrade noted that after Bitcoin’s False break, the cryptocurrency quickly moved back into the Ascending Channel to reclaim the lower support line. Interestingly, Bitcoin’s drop below the False break comes as the pioneer cryptocurrency experienced a sharp price crash below $95,000. Lately, the flagship cryptocurrency has been under significantly bearish pressure, recording notable declines as market volatility intensifies. Despite this bearish performance, Trader Tardigrade has disclosed that Bitcoin is now retesting the channel’s support line again, aiming to break above and trigger a price reversal. The analyst predicts that if Bitcoin can hold this support line, it will likely continue moving upwards within the channel. Consequently, the analyst has forecasted that Bitcoin’s next price target would be the upper resistance line of the Ascending Channel. Looking at the price chart, the channel points upwards towards a range between $110,000 and $112,000. If Bitcoin can successfully recover toward the upper resistance line, it could signal the continuation of a bullish trend within the Ascending Channel. Additionally, a breakout above the resistance line could further validate the bullish momentum, setting up a stage for Bitcoin to potentially target higher price levels and possibly retest its all-time high.

According to crypto analyst Titan of Crypto, the Bitcoin price could see another decline, with the support level at $87,000 being the next target. However, according to the analyst, a drop to this price low could bring “maximum pain” to both short—and long-term investors. Nevertheless, Titan of Crypto believes this severe price decline could also present a strong foundation for Bitcoin’s next price rally. He emphasized that price movements are rarely linear, highlighting the crypto market’s inherent unpredictability and volatility. Despite Bitcoin’s bearish behavior, Titan of Crypto confidently predicts that a price rally to $110,000 is inevitable.

Cardano Price Outlook & Dogecoin Whale Activity Soar,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdags-whitepaper-v3-reveals-tech-progress-cardano-price-outlook-dogecoin-whale-activity-soar/,"As the altcoin sector braces for an expected $2.5 trillion surge, giants like Cardano, Dogecoin, and BlockDAG (BDAG) are picking up steam. The Cardano price outlook is attracting attention with a surge in whale activity as hefty investors scoop up 160 million ADA tokens following its recent slip to $0.91. In tandem, Dogecoin whales are tactically maneuvering through critical support levels, eyeing the $0.684 mark. On the other hand, BlockDAG, fresh off the release of its Whitepaper V3, continues to draw in crypto whales eager for the next blockbuster financial opportunity. The whitepaper sheds light on significant updates and strategic plans for BlockDAG’s tech through 2025. What’s more, this utility-centric project is causing a splash in the presale market, having raised over $173 million across 26 batches, rapidly closing in on its ambitious $600 million target. Cardano Price Outlook: Will It Breach $1 & Hit $2.27? The buzz around Cardano price outlook is growing as major investors accumulate 160 million ADA tokens post its dip to $0.91. After a 6% recovery, ADA now trades at $0.95, with forecasts suggesting it could rise to $1.2 soon if it surpasses the critical $1 mark. Looking further ahead, the long-term outlook sets a $2.27 target, making the $1 level crucial for upward momentum. Yet, the road to recovery for Cardano price outlook is not without its bumps. The drop in daily active users by 58% poses questions about lasting engagement. Furthermore, there are worries about its resilience in holding the $0.90 support amid market ups and downs. Can Dogecoin Whale Activity Push to $0.415? A recent update from @CryptoMichNL on platform X underscored that the “Altcoin market capitalization has beautifully retested and is set to climb to $2.5T.” This statement underscores the heightened activity across altcoins, notably Dogecoin, which continues to captivate due to significant whale movements. Currently at $0.348, Dogecoin Whale movements have maintained the essential $0.264 support level, targeting $0.415 and $0.684. While such whales frequently ignite price hikes, their influence brings about concerns regarding market equilibrium. Observers note that Dogecoin’s limited utility detracts from its competitiveness, and its volatile price trends cause hesitation among investors, highlighting the need for more robust fundamentals to sustain long-term growth. BlockDAG’s Whitepaper V3: Tackling Crypto’s Scalability & Privacy Issues The anticipated altcoin boom, projected to push the market to a staggering $2.5 trillion, has all eyes on ventures ready to lead this explosive growth. At the forefront is BlockDAG, a cutting-edge blockchain platform reshaping the crypto landscape. Having already amassed over $173 million by offloading more than 17.5 billion BDAG coins, BlockDAG has outstripped all expectations. Early backers have witnessed an incredible 2,240% growth in their holdings, as the price of BDAG coins skyrocketed from an initial $0.001 to $0.0234 in the current batch. BlockDAG’s recently launched Whitepaper V3 has enthralled both developers and whales, unveiling advanced solutions that tackle scalability, privacy, and compatibility challenges. It seamlessly integrates the UTXO model for private transactions and the account-based model for Ethereum-compatible smart contracts, creating an ideal platform for DeFi, dApps, and NFTs. The document also introduces the Phantom GhostDAG protocol, pioneering a partially ordered transaction system that slashes fees while safeguarding transaction integrity, setting a new efficiency standard in the blockchain arena. This innovation is igniting a flurry of interest among crypto enthusiasts, fueling a swift uptick in presale holdings. Market experts now believe BlockDAG could hit its $600 million presale goal sooner than anticipated. With BDAG coins in high demand, the ongoing presale batch is nearing completion, poised to trigger a sharp price rise in the subsequent phase. For those eyeing the best crypto project , the time to dive in is now, before the opportunity dwindles and prices spike. What is the Best Crypto Project? The altcoin arena is abuzz, with the Cardano price outlook hinting at renewed whale accumulations, and Dogecoin whale activity solidifying key supports. Yet, the spotlight is increasingly on BlockDAG, which is setting new standards with its latest Whitepaper V3 and impressive presale achievements. Having already surpassed the $173 million mark, BlockDAG is quickly nearing its $600 million goal. For those still pondering the next big crypto project, BlockDAG is emerging as a standout contender, offering unparalleled growth potential.

Trump Cyborg (TRUMPCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCYB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Cyborg launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Cyborg on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Cyborg by entering its contract address – 9yaNQ89EaQ2nEDczZpuTZfDwfiYCxbwSYC4JeiWLDE57 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCYB.

Sounds like a dream portfolio, doesn’t it? In the fast-paced crypto world, where fortunes can be made overnight, three names stand out: BTFD Coin (BTFD), Ponke (PONKE), and COQ Inu (COQ). Each is blazing a unique trail in the meme coin landscape. BTFD Coin has captivated investors with its massive presale success, Ponke is breaking boundaries with decentralised utility, and COQ Inu is charting new territory with cutting-edge interoperability. Here’s why these projects are the top new meme coins with 1000X potential. BTFD Coin: A Festive Presale Like No Other Let’s start with the hottest meme coin on the block—the BTFD Coin. Imagine an investment that not only promises massive returns but also rewards you with a 50% bonus just for getting in early. In Stage 13 of its presale, BTFD is priced at $0.000142 per coin, and with the BIG50 code, investors can maximise their holdings. This isn’t just a coin; it’s a movement. “ Buy The Dip ” isn’t just a slogan—it’s a strategy. The project is built on the principle that dips are opportunities, not setbacks. It’s no wonder BTFD has already raised over $4.6 million, sold 60 billion coins, and attracted 6,900+ enthusiastic holders. The coin’s Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, now in beta, is adding another layer of excitement. While rewards aren’t live yet, the gameplay is drawing attention from both gamers and investors. Add to this a staking system offering 90% APY and a referral programme that’s turning the community into a marketing powerhouse, and it’s clear BTFD is here to stay. To paint a picture, investing $5,000 at the current presale price would get you 35.2 million BTFD coins. With the BIG50 bonus, that jumps to 52.8 million. When the coin lists at $0.0006, your investment could balloon to $31,680. Joining is simple. Visit the BTFD Presale Page , connect your wallet, don’t forget to apply the BIG50 code for 50% extra BTFD Coins, and secure your investment before January 5, 2025. Act fast! Ponke: Utility That Sets It Apart Ponke is more than just another meme coin. With the launch of PonkeSwap, a decentralised exchange, it’s proving that meme coins can offer real-world utility. This move positions Ponke as a serious contender in the crypto space, appealing to both meme enthusiasts and utility-focused investors. Despite its innovative strides, Ponke has faced its share of challenges. After its Binance Futures listing, the coin experienced a short-lived surge, climbing from $0.44 to $0.55, only to settle at its current price of $0.32. While the volatility might deter some, it also presents an opportunity for those who believe in Ponke’s long-term vision. Ponke’s ability to adapt and innovate, particularly in the decentralised finance (DeFi) space, makes it a coin to watch. Its commitment to blending entertainment and functionality sets it apart in a crowded market. COQ Inu: Innovation Through Interoperability COQ Inu is rewriting the playbook for meme coins by integrating Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Token Standard. This technological leap allows COQ to operate seamlessly across multiple blockchains, making it more accessible and versatile than many of its competitors. Currently priced at $0.00000157, COQ Inu has seen a 15.74% price dip over the past week. While this might raise eyebrows, it’s important to remember that innovation often comes with growing pains. COQ’s focus on technological advancement positions it as a long-term player in the meme coin space. By addressing the interoperability challenge, COQ Inu is not just riding the meme coin wave—it’s leading it. Investors who value cutting-edge solutions in the crypto space will find COQ Inu’s approach both refreshing and promising. Turning Dips Into Opportunities The 1973 stock market crash taught us an invaluable lesson: downturns aren’t failures; they’re opportunities. Smart investors turned that chaos into immense wealth by buying undervalued assets. BTFD Coin embodies this ethos, offering a chance to invest before the next bull run. By focusing on presale opportunities, BTFD allows investors to get in early, maximise their returns, and ride the wave of its innovative ecosystem. Conclusion If you’re looking for the top new meme coins with 1000X potential , BTFD Coin is the standout choice based on current trends. Its limited-time 50% bonus, thriving presale, and innovative features make it a must-have for forward-thinking investors. While Ponke and COQ Inu bring their unique strengths to the table, it’s BTFD’s momentum and ROI potential that truly shine. Don’t miss your chance to be part of this revolution.

The Bitget Token ( BGB ) is trading at $7.37 at time of writing and is up nearly 28% in the past 24 hours and more than 70% in the past week. BGB’s gains partially materialized amid news that Bitget plans to merge the token with its other native asset, the Bitget Wallet Token ( BWB ). BWB, the 638th-ranked crypto asset by market cap, is down more than 4% in the past day but up nearly 45% in the past week. Bitget’s merger will unify both tokens under the BGB label. The exchange says the decision was driven by community demand. Explains Bitget chief executive Gracy Chen, “By merging BGB and BWB, we are taking a major step toward building a unified and robust ecosystem that bridges on-chain and off-chain applications. This move will enhance the utility of BGB, and ensure that every holder benefits from Bitget ecosystem growth.” Bitget says BWB holders on the exchange can automatically swap their BWB to BGB at a 0.08563 ratio, which the firm says was calculated using a 7-day average closing price of the BWB/USDT pair on Bitget. BGB is currently the 22nd-ranked crypto asset by market cap. The overall crypto market cap dropped by 4.7% on Thursday, according to CoinGecko.

As we approach 2025, investors and enthusiasts are keen to identify which cryptocurrencies will lead the charge. Here’s a curated list of the top five cryptocurrencies expected to make a substantial impact: 1. Qubetics ($TICS) Qubetics is making waves by integrating decentralised Virtual Private Networks (dVPNs) into its ecosystem. This addition enhances user privacy and supports various decentralised services, including DeFi, NFTs, and decentralised storage. Qubetics dVPN upholds the core principles of autonomy and decentralisation central to Web3 by ensuring secure and private connections.Currently, in Presale Phase 14, Qubetics offers a compelling opportunity for early investors. With TICS tokens priced at $0.037, the project has already raised over $7.9 million, attracted more than 12,100 holders, and sold 379 million tokens. The presale structure includes weekly phases with a 10% price hike, culminating in a 20% increase in the final stage. Analysts project a post-presale target of $0.25 per token, indicating a potential ROI of 563.81% for early adopters. Forecasts suggest that Qubetics could reach $10 to $15 after the mainnet launch, underscoring its potential as a top cryptocurrency to watch in 2025 . 2. Bitcoin (BTC) As the pioneer of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin continues to dominate the market. In 2024, Bitcoin experienced significant gains, surpassing $100,000 due to interest in spot Bitcoin ETFs, a supply-reducing halving event, and expectations of pro-crypto policies following political developments. Analysts maintain a largely positive outlook for Bitcoin through 2025, with varying predictions. Bitwise forecasts Bitcoin could attain $200,000 and potentially $500,000 if the U.S. government adopts a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Standard Chartered shares a positive outlook, while VanEck projects Bitcoin reaching $180,000 amidst significant volatility. 3. Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink’s decentralised oracle network is a cornerstone in the blockchain ecosystem, providing reliable real-world data to smart contracts. Its effectiveness in integrating off-chain data with on-chain applications has led to widespread adoption across various sectors. As blockchain technology continues to permeate different industries, Chainlink's role becomes increasingly vital, positioning it as a promising investment for those looking toward 2025. 4. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum remains at the forefront of decentralised applications and smart contract platforms. The anticipated full deployment of Ethereum 2.0 aims to address scalability issues, potentially leading to higher transaction speeds and lower gas fees. This evolution could further solidify Ethereum's position as a leading platform for DeFi, NFTs, and other blockchain-based applications. Analysts project that Ethereum could trade in a wide range, with a minimum price of $2,670 and a maximum of $5,990 by 2025, depending on market momentum. 5. VeChain (VET) VeChain focuses on enhancing supply chain efficiency and sustainability through its innovative use of decentralised technology. VeChain enables businesses to streamline operations and build consumer trust by providing transparent and tamper-proof data on products and services. As global supply chains become increasingly complex, VeChain's solutions are well-positioned to address these challenges, making it a cryptocurrency to watch in the coming years. Conclusion The cryptocurrency market is poised for significant developments as we approach 2025. Projects like Qubetics , with its innovative dVPN integration and established players like Bitcoin, Chainlink, Ethereum, and VeChain, offer diverse opportunities for investors and technology enthusiasts alike. Staying informed and conducting thorough research are essential steps for anyone looking to navigate this dynamic landscape and capitalise on the potential growth of these digital assets.

JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo – the four largest banks in the US – recorded $88 billion in collective profits in the first nine months of the year, the Financial Times reports , using figures from BankRegData. The banking giants now account for 44% of all the industry’s profits, and when you combine the “Big Four” with US Bank, PNC and Truist – the next three largest banks – the seven institutions are reaping 56% of all the profits in the field, up from 48% in 2023. PNC bank didn’t respond to FT’s requests for comments while the other six banks declined to comment altogether. Says Oppenheimer banking analyst Chris Kotowski, “Once you get much below the biggest banks, then it does become really hard to make the necessary investments and have the same name recognition… We’re a very mobile society, especially since Covid. Lots of people that move from New York to Florida for example, do you really need to have a different bank in Florida than you do in New York?” The consolidation of power by the biggest US banks highlights the struggle of smaller institutions to deal with regulation, volatile interest rates and the ability of larger banks to spread their presence digitally across the country.

Prince Elon (ELONPRIN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONPRIN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports.

Dogecoin Has Seen Positive Signals On TD Sequential & Whale Supply In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a Tom Demark (TD) Sequential signal that Dogecoin has just witnessed on its 4-hour price chart. The “TD Sequential” refers to a technical analysis indicator that’s used for locating points of probable reversal for any asset’s price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Tokens Have Only Been Getting Older This Bull Run, Analyst Reveals The indicator includes two phases, called the setup and countdown. During the first of these, the setup, candles in the price of the same color are counted up to nine. These candles aren’t necessary to be consecutive. When the nine candles are in, the setup is said to be finished, and the TD Sequential gives a reversal signal for the asset. Naturally, if the candles involved in the setup’s completion were green, the indicator would suggest a top, and if they were red, the signal would be for a bottom. As soon as the setup is over, the countdown phase begins. This phase of the TD Sequential works exactly the same as the setup, except for the fact that it involves thirteen candles, not nine. Once these candles have also been printed, the indicator gives another buy or sell signal for the price. Recently, Dogecoin has finished the first of these TD Sequential phases. Here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows this signal in DOGE’s 4-hour price: As is visible in the above graph, the Dogecoin 4-hour price has completed the TD Sequential setup with nine green candles, which implies the coin may now be set for a turnaround to the upside. This isn’t the only positive signal that DOGE has observed recently, as Martinez has pointed out in another X post that the whales have been busy purchasing during the last couple of days. The on-chain indicator cited by the analyst is the Supply Distribution from the analytics firm Santiment, which tells us about the amount of supply that any particular wallet group is holding right now. Below is the chart for the metric that specifically shows the data for the whale cohort, massive investors carrying between 10 million and 100 million tokens: From the graph, it’s apparent that the Dogecoin supply held by the whales has registered an increase recently. More specifically, the whales have added a net amount of 90 million DOGE (worth around $28.7 million) to their holdings in the last two days. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Bull Run Over?

However, for those seeking more affordable options with greater potential for growth, altcoins are an excellent choice. These alternatives to Bitcoin provide quicker transactions, distinctive features, and unique applications. They’re also within reach for those with smaller budgets, offering chances to achieve significant returns. Deterred by Bitcoin’s steep price or its uncertain future returns? What if you could invest just $100 and position yourself for considerable short-term gains? The strategy involves selecting altcoins that offer affordability, innovation, and solid foundations. Let’s delve into the altcoins with the most potential available now, including a standout project—BlockDAG.

Its development is grounded in peer-reviewed research, ensuring reliability and robust security. Its multi-layered structure promotes efficient processing and scalability for future expansion. The Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus model of Cardano drastically reduces its energy footprint, ranking it among the most eco-conscious blockchains. The Alonzo upgrade has broadened its capabilities, introducing smart contracts that facilitate DeFi, supply chain solutions, and more. 4. Ripple (XRP): Streamlining International Payments Ripple is modernizing international payments by remedying inefficiencies found in conventional banking, offering rapid and cost-effective transfers. Its blockchain solution is specially designed for cross-border payments, enabling financial entities to transmit funds globally in moments with negligible fees. Ripple’s extensive partnerships with banks and payment services globally showcase its potential to reform international finance. Despite legal hurdles, Ripple continues to focus on innovation and international growth, which could further elevate its use and market position with a positive outcome in its legal dealings. The Bottom Line Among altcoins with the most potential, BlockDAG is notable for its unique DAG-based structure, successful early sales, and the anticipated launch of its mainnet. These milestones position it well for both immediate profits and sustained development. To achieve a well-rounded crypto portfolio, mixing BlockDAG with cryptos like Toncoin, Polygon, and Cardano could optimize returns while ensuring diversification. With an initial investment of $100, you can begin assembling a collection of promising cryptos expected to yield notable outcomes.

In an interview with Anthony Pompliano, he pointed out that while the SEC was targeting Ripple, other high-profile figures like Sam Bankman-Fried were involved in serious financial misconduct without facing similar regulatory pressure. Gasparino argued that this was an example of regulatory overreach. He also said that Ripple’s technology, which underlies XRP, has potential but is now forced to operate overseas due to the lack of clear regulations in the U.S. The SEC’s legal actions have created uncertainty, and even after a judge made a decision in favor of Ripple, Gasparino criticized the ruling. “So they ( the SEC) bring the case, they get this judge who says, ‘Oh no, the investors, the retail investors don’t need the disclosure, they’re okay not disclosing to retail, but they should have disclosed it to the institution.’ This idiotic judge didn’t even know that she established precedent that there should be less disclosure for retail,” he said The judge had decided that Ripple did not need to disclose information to retail investors but should have disclosed it to institutional investors, a move Gasparino called “stupid.” He said that the ruling created a dangerous precedent for less disclosure for retail investors, explaining the mess that the case had become. Gasparino explained that his interest in Ripple began years earlier when he covered Ethereum’s efforts to establish its own regulatory framework, which led to a viral reaction after a clip of his reporting was shared by a Ripple supporter. Gasparino believes the scrutiny of Ripple and XRP seemed unjust, particularly when compared to the leniency shown to other figures.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-28 02:12:25

Top Crypto to Buy Now Amid Solana’s $776M Inflows and Ethereum Whale Moves What if you could secure your financial future by investing in the right crypto at the right time? With blockchain technology rapidly redefining our digital interactions, picking the top cryptos to buy and hold for the long term has never been more crucial. The latest updates on Ethereum and Solana are stirring the crypto market, but the buzz around Qubetics ($TICS) is stealing the spotlight. While Ethereum faces market tremors from whale activity and Solana demonstrates its robust market recovery, Qubetics’ presale generates unmatched excitement. This article will explore the developments of Qubetics, Solana, and Ethereum, helping you decide which crypto is the most promising to buy and hold for the long term. Qubetics: Transforming Web3 Privacy with dVPN In a world where digital privacy is constantly threatened, Qubetics ($TICS) is rewriting the rules. As part of its expansive Web3 infrastructure, Qubetics offers a decentralised VPN (dVPN) service. Unlike traditional VPN providers, which often track and control user data, the Qubetics dVPN relies on a peer-to-peer, blockchain-powered network. This decentralisation means no single entity can manipulate or monitor your online activity, ensuring true privacy and resistance to censorship. What makes this even more compelling is how it incentivises participation. Users who share bandwidth are rewarded with TICS tokens, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem. Enhanced security features, such as multi-hop routing and end-to-end encryption, bolster anonymity and protect sensitive data. This innovation makes Qubetics a standout among the top cryptos to buy and hold for the long term. Qubetics recently hosted an engaging AMA session, providing insights into their vision and addressing community questions. This transparent approach reinforces its commitment to building trust and fostering a loyal investor base. Solana: A Marriage of Innovation and Controversy Solana has made headlines for reasons beyond its technological advancements. Co-founder Stephen Akridge, embroiled in a legal dispute, faces allegations of withholding yield generated by Solana tokens during a divorce settlement. Despite this drama, Solana’s performance speaks volumes. With $776 million in daily inflows, the blockchain is cementing its reputation as a reliable platform for developers and investors alike. Boasting faster transactions and lower costs, Solana continues to attract attention as a leading competitor in the crypto space. It’s a testament to its potential for long-term growth, even amidst personal controversies. Ethereum: Whale Activity Sparks Investor Curiosity Ethereum, one of the most established blockchains, recently experienced significant activity. An ICO whale, known for strategic profit-taking, transferred 4,160 ETH—worth approximately $14.5 million—to Kraken. This move has raised concerns about potential selling pressure, which could lead to short-term price fluctuations. Historically, this whale has timed exits during market peaks, as seen with a $10.1 million sale earlier this month. Such activity fuels speculation about Ethereum’s immediate market trends. However, its long-term value remains undisputed, making it a staple in any portfolio. The Qubetics Presale: A Gateway to Early-Stage Gains The Qubetics presale is where the excitement truly builds. Currently, in Phase 14, $TICS tokens are priced at $0.037. With over $7.9 million raised, 12,100+ holders, and 379 million tokens sold, this presale has already captured significant attention. Investors are flocking to secure their share, knowing that each phase brings a 10% price increase, culminating in a 20% surge in the final stage. Missing out now could mean paying more later, making it one of the top cryptos to buy and hold for the long term. The momentum surrounding Qubetics is growing daily, driven by its unique use cases and token economics. Early investors gain financially and position themselves at the forefront of blockchain innovation. Will you be one of them? Conclusion: Which Crypto Should You Back? The crypto market is alive with opportunities, and each coin—Ethereum, Solana, and Qubetics ($TICS)—offers unique advantages. Ethereum’s proven history, Solana’s technological prowess, and Qubetics’ innovative dVPN service collectively highlight why these are the top cryptos to buy and hold long-term. Yet, the spotlight shines brightest on Qubetics . Its presale is a rare chance to join a project that combines cutting-edge technology with lucrative early investment opportunities. With price increases on the horizon, there’s no better time to dive in. Secure your stake in the future with Qubetics ($TICS), your gateway to blockchain success.

As part of its expansive ecosystem, Qubetics introduces a decentralised VPN (dVPN) service that aims to redefine internet privacy and security. Unlike traditional VPNs, which often centralise user data and risk breaches, the Qubetics dVPN leverages blockchain to decentralise operations. But what does this mean for users? The Qubetics dVPN ensures that no central authority controls user traffic, eliminating censorship and enhancing privacy. Its peer-to-peer network provides unmatched transparency and rewards users who share bandwidth with $TICS tokens. Imagine an internet where your privacy is protected, your data is encrypted, and you’re incentivised to participate. Could this be the future of secure browsing? Additionally, Qubetics has been fostering a stronger connection with its community by hosting an engaging AMA session . These sessions provide clarity, insights, and a sneak peek into their ambitious roadmap. With innovations like these, Qubetics is swiftly positioning itself as a top crypto to invest in. Bitwise Eyes New Horizons with Bitcoin ETF Bitcoin continues to lead the charge in crypto innovation. Bitwise Asset Management has recently filed for a new exchange-traded fund (ETF) aimed at companies holding substantial Bitcoin reserves. The proposed Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF will invest in publicly traded firms with at least 1,000 BTC in their treasuries. This initiative, detailed in a filing submitted on 26 December, includes rigorous criteria for companies to qualify, ensuring transparency and stability. By prioritising firms with significant Bitcoin holdings, the ETF aims to provide exposure to Bitcoin’s value while diversifying risks. This development underscores Bitcoin’s enduring role as a pillar of the crypto ecosystem. Arweave: A New Chapter in Decentralised Storage Arweave, the blockchain designed for permanent data storage, continues to make waves with its innovative use cases. Offering a decentralised solution to data archiving, Arweave ensures information is accessible and tamper-proof forever. Its unique permaweb structure increasingly appeals to developers and organisations seeking reliable and secure storage. This commitment to advancing storage technology positions Arweave as a noteworthy contender in the blockchain sector. As enterprises and projects increasingly demand decentralised solutions, Arweave’s relevance and utility only grow stronger. Qubetics Presale: Don’t Miss the Next Big Leap The excitement surrounding Qubetics’ presale is palpable. Currently, in Phase 14, the presale is structured to reward early adopters with significant price gains. Each phase introduces a 10% price increase, culminating in a 20% jump in the final stage. At present, $TICS tokens are priced at $0.037, with over $7.9 million already raised. This dynamic pricing model reflects the project’s growing demand and incentivises investors to act quickly. As one of the top cryptos to invest in , Qubetics offers a rare opportunity to get in early on a project with immense potential. If you want to combine innovation, community, and investment growth, Qubetics might just be the game-changer you’re waiting for. Conclusion: A Bright Future for Crypto Investors The latest developments across Qubetics, Bitcoin, and Arweave demonstrate the immense innovation within the cryptocurrency world. Analysts predict exciting trajectories for all three projects, with each catering to unique market needs. However, the standout opportunity lies with Qubetics ($TICS). Its decentralised VPN service, robust community engagement, and thrilling presale make it one of the top cryptos to invest in today. As $TICS tokens edge closer to their next price hike, the window for early investment narrows. Will you seize the moment and become part of Qubetics’ groundbreaking journey?

Instead, the market is moving sideways, hinting at a period of consolidation within an overall uptrend. At the time of writing, XRP is down by more than two percent and is trading at $2.17. Uptrend Still in Play Despite the current consolidation, the overall trend for XRP is still bullish. The price action looks like a temporary pullback, rather than the start of a downtrend. If the price continues to move upward, it could challenge its all-time high of around $3.25 to $3.30, which also aligns with a critical Fibonacci level. Holding Above the 2021 High A key point to note is that XRP is holding above its 2021 high of $1.96. This is a strong signal of market strength. Maintaining this level is crucial for XRP’s continued positive momentum, and as long as the price stays above this, the market outlook remains favorable. Short-Term Market Behavior: Triangle Formation On the shorter time frame, XRP is currently forming a triangle pattern. While triangle patterns can lead to breakouts in either direction, they are fragile and tend to be less reliable. As a result, there is a possibility of short-term bearish action, but the price could also break to the upside. Key Levels for Risk Management For traders, it’s important to monitor the key support and resistance levels within this triangle. The price must hold above the $1.95 support level to maintain the triangle pattern. If it falls below this point, the likelihood of a bearish move increases, and the triangle scenario may be invalidated. The $1.95 level is the key support for XRP and if the price stays above this, the consolidation pattern is likely to continue. However, if the price drops below this level, we could see a more significant pullback, with the next support areas being around $1.80 to $1.39.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-28 02:31:34

Winter Pepe (PEPEWINT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEWINT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Winter Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Winter Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Winter Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Winter Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Winter Pepe by entering its contract address – CUreLFB9SJmu6WEpotjmLJgt1khhdpneukDRJsbXFCGM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEWINT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-28 02:52:00

Lightchain AI, currently in its presale phase at just $0.003, is attracting significant attention for its innovative use of artificial intelligence in blockchain. Positioned as a promising project, its unique features and tokenomics set it apart from other tokens in the space. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu continues to maintain its place as one of the most recognized meme coins, with ongoing developments aimed at expanding its ecosystem. Both tokens offer intriguing opportunities for investors looking to capitalize on the next wave of crypto market growth. In this article, we’ll take a closer look at the potential of these two altcoins and why they are worth keeping an eye on. Lightchain AI: Redefining Blockchain with Artificial Intelligence Lightchain AI is changing the blockchain world by smoothly combining smart machines with blockc͏hain tech. As a fresh idea, it offers special traits that boost growth, safety, and speed, giving a new type of blockchain answer. With its smart machine-led method Lightchain AI can make tasks automatic improve deal times and fine-tune network work. Right now in its early sale phase at $0.003, it shows a good chance for first buyers to join in a project that mixes two of the most changing technologies. The money system and plan of Lightchain AI also show its power to make a strong mark in the crypto area. Shiba Inu: Riding the Meme Coin Wave with Continued Developments Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a meme coin that has been making waves in the cryptocurrency community since its launch in 2020. As a decentralized cryptocurrency, SHIB operates on the Ethereum blockchain and presents a fun and tongue-in-cheek approach to crypto investing. Despite its playful nature, SHIB has maintained strong support from its dedicated community and has recently made headlines with new developments aimed at expanding its ecosystem. This includes plans for decentralized exchange listings, integration with online gaming platforms, and partnerships with major companies such as Amazon. With these exciting developments on the horizon, SHIB continues to show potential for long-term growth. In addition, SHIB has also shown resilience during periods of market volatility. While other altcoins may experience significant dips in value, SHIB has managed to maintain a relatively stable price range. This makes it an attractive option for investors looking for a more secure and less volatile alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Which Altcoin Should You Watch? When deciding which altcoin to watch, two standout options in the current market are Lightchain AI and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Lightchain AI, with its innovative blend of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology, is gaining significant attention. Currently in its presale phase at $0.003, it offers investors an early entry into a promising project focused on improving scalability and security through AI-driven solutions. With a solid roadmap and unique tokenomics, Lightchain AI stands out as a long-term investment opportunity. On the other hand, Shiba Inu continues to be a dominant force in the meme coin space, with a growing ecosystem and increasing community engagement. While Lightchain AI offers a tech-driven approach, Shiba Inu remains a popular choice for those looking to invest in a recognized and growing community. But lightchain AI is more potential and more opportunities to grow.",Press Release,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|SHIB,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-28 03:00:00

This is evident in Bitcoin reserves on spot exchanges, which had been in a steady decline for weeks, now seeing a notable uptick with an inflow exceeding 20,000 BTC, according to CryptoQuant analyst IT Tech. Simultaneously, netflows across all exchanges turned positive, registering an increase of 15,800 BTC. These shifts mark a reversal from the consistent outflow trend observed in previous weeks, suggesting that traders may be preparing for increased activity on exchanges. Related Reading: Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Giving Potential Buy Signal, Quant Says Detailing The Increasing Exchange Reserves and Positive Netflows When Bitcoin reserves rise on exchanges, it typically signals an intent to trade or sell, introducing the possibility of selling pressure. Similarly, positive net flows indicate that the volume of Bitcoin moving onto exchanges is outpacing the volume being withdrawn. Historically, such patterns have often been associated with periods of increased market volatility. While the long-term accumulation trend remains intact, these new inflows highlight a short-term shift in sentiment, suggesting that investors may be positioning themselves for profit-taking or preparing for potential price corrections. IT Tech wrote: If reserves and netflows continue to rise, we could see increased volatility and potential downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price in the near term. This reversal highlights the importance of monitoring exchange activity for early signs of changing market sentiment. Another Bitcoin Metric Signalling Growing Buying Pressure While there have been signs of looming price action, another CryptoQuant analyst Burak Kesmeci has highlighted an opposite key observation: Bitcoin Taker Buy Volume on Binance has surged to $8.3 billion. This metric tracks the total volume of buy transactions executed by “takers” on Binance—market participants who purchase BTC at current market prices using existing liquidity. An increase in Taker Buy Volume is generally interpreted as a sign of heightened investor interest and growing buying pressure. Binance Bitcoin Taker Buy Volume Reaches $8.3 Billion! “We have observed that the Binance Taker Buy Volume has formed higher lows. This indicates that investor interest is increasing and buying pressure is strengthening.” – By @burak_kesmeci Link 👇https://t.co/axZopFuK0v pic.twitter.com/POtTGvcxrY — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) December 26, 2024 Kesmeci noted that over the past 60 days, Binance Taker Buy Volume has consistently formed higher lows. This trend indicates persistent buying activity despite occasional market corrections. Related Reading: BTC price is moving upwards on the 2-hour chart. Source: BTC/USDT on TradingView.com The sustained increase in Taker Buy Volume suggests that demand remains strong, potentially driving Bitcoin prices upward in the near term.

Just last month, Bonk caught everyone’s eye with its explosive surge, but it seems there’s a new player in town that’s stealing the show. BTFD Coin (BTFD), with its presale performance skyrocketing past $4.6 million and growing, is breaking records like it’s smashing piñatas. If you thought meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu had their moment, think again. BTFD Coin is proving that the best meme coins with 1000X potential aren’t a thing of the past—they’re just getting started. Over the years, meme coins have gone from a joke to some of the most lucrative investments in the crypto world. They’ve built communities, inspired memes, and, yes, created millionaires overnight. But here’s the kicker: BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme coin riding the hype wave. It’s shaking things up with a killer play-to-earn (P2E) game , a robust referral programme, juicy staking rewards, and a tight-knit community that’s growing faster than you can say “HODL.” It’s not just riding the meme coin trend; it’s redefining it. So, what’s the scoop on Bonk and BTFD Coin? Why is BTFD dominating headlines, and what makes it the hottest presale of the year? Let’s dive into this ultimate showdown of the best meme coins with 1000X potential and find out why BTFD Coin’s presale is your golden ticket to the next crypto bull run. Bonk: The Viral Star That Keeps People Talking When Bonk burst onto the scene, it felt like the early days of Dogecoin all over again. As the first Solana-based meme coin to go mainstream, Bonk gained traction thanks to its loyal community and unique decentralised approach. It was fun, quirky, and completely on-brand for what people expect from meme coins. Its interactive “pop-to-click” feature drew thousands to its ecosystem, making it a viral sensation practically overnight. But here’s the thing—as fun as Bonk is, its utility is limited. It’s like a firework show that dazzles the crowd but fades fast. After peaking at $2 earlier this year, it’s now trading at around $0.7, a sharp reminder of how volatile these coins can be. Analysts predict that Bonk could recover if Bitcoin rallies, potentially reaching $3 or $4 next year. But without significant updates or additional use cases, it’s walking a tightrope. Despite its shortcomings, Bonk still holds a spot in the hearts of meme coin enthusiasts. It’s nostalgic and taps into that community-driven ethos that made Dogecoin a legend. However, when you’ve got a coin like BTFD that’s smashing presale records, Bonk starts to look a little like yesterday’s news. Could Bonk reinvent itself and climb back up the charts? Sure. But for now, it’s more of a gamble than a strategic play. BTFD Coin: The New King of Meme Coins If Bonk is the cool kid everyone wants to be friends with, BTFD Coin is the overachiever breaking every record in the book. BTFD Coin has raised over $4.6 million in its presale, with 60 billion coins sold and 6,900 holders already in the mix. That’s not just impressive; it’s jaw-dropping. And the cherry on top? You can unlock 50% extra coins using the code BIG50. Seriously, who does that? But let’s not stop at the numbers. BTFD Coin has real utility, something that sets it apart from the pack. Its P2E game isn’t just a gimmick; it’s a full-blown ecosystem where players can earn while having a blast. The referral programme sweetens the deal, giving users a reason to spread the word and grow the community. Add staking rewards into the mix, and you’ve got a meme coin that’s not just for laughs but for long-term gains. Let’s break it down with an example. Imagine you’ve got $25,000 burning a hole in your pocket. At Stage 13, with a price of $0.000142 per BTFD Coin, you’d snag 176,056,338 coins. Now, hold onto your hat: when the presale price hits $0.0006, your investment will balloon to $105,633. Yeah, you read that right. That’s more than four times your initial investment. Talk about a glow-up. And we haven’t even talked about the community yet. BTFD’s following is growing faster than a TikTok trend, with over 6,900 bulls rallying behind it. This isn’t just hype; it’s a movement. Analysts are already predicting that BTFD could become the poster child for the next crypto bull run, and honestly, it’s hard to argue with that. Why BTFD Coin Is the Smart Play Right Now When you stack BTFD Coin against Bonk, it’s like comparing a Tesla to a tricycle. Bonk has its charm, sure, but BTFD is the complete package. It’s got utility, it’s got community, and most importantly, it’s got potential. The best meme coins with 1000X potential aren’t just about riding a wave; they’re about building something that lasts. And that’s exactly what BTFD Coin is doing. With its presale already past $4.6 million and a total of 16 stages, the opportunities here are as juicy as a summer barbecue. The BIG50 code gives you 50% extra coins, making this one of the most generous presale offers on the market. If you’re looking for a meme coin that’s more than just a pretty face, BTFD is it.

Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have tumbled, with BTC falling below 95K and ETH now down to the 3300 range. It has been over a month since Bitcoin touched 94K, and it continues trading in a range between 94K and 108K. Top altcoins are showing bearish momentum, with most coins down by 1% to 5% over the last 24 hours. The overall market cap has also dropped by approximately 2%, now standing at 3.28 trillion. Trading volume has seen a significant decline of 34%, as many investors are in a holiday mood and enjoying the last days of 2024. Market activity is expected to pick up after the first week of January when trading volume will likely return to normal levels. The Fear and Greed Index is currently at 51, indicating a neutral sentiment in the market. Crypto Market Today: BTC, ETH, XRP, and SOL Prices Drop Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, and Solana (SOL) have faced significant declines, mirroring the overall market downturn. The holiday season slowdown continues to impact trading volumes and prices. Bitcoin Market Today Bitcoin (BTC) price was trading at $94,327, down approximately 2% over the last 24 hours. Its 24-hour low and high were $93,440 and $97,429, respectively. Robert Kiyosaki has made a bold prediction , forecasting that Bitcoin will reach $350,000 by 2025 and urging investors to prioritize self-custody over institutional ETFs. According to SoSo Value , BTC ETFs saw an outflow of $367 million on Friday, with Fidelity accounting for $208 million of the outflow. Ark & 21Shares reported an outflow of $112 million, while data from BlackRock is still awaited. Ethereum Market Today Ethereum (ETH) price dropped by about 1%, now at $3,329, with a 24-hour low of $3,307 and a high of $3,441. The ETH ETF saw an inflow of $27 million yesterday, as Fidelity purchased $27 million worth of Ethereum. This shift in the crypto market today highlights the growing institutional interest in Ethereum. XRP Market Today XRP price was trading at $2.144 at the time of writing, down by approximately 2%. Its 24-hour low and high were $2.126 and $2.234, respectively. Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton has criticized a newly finalized crypto tax reporting rule issued by the Biden administration. Solana Market Today Solana (SOL) price was down by 2%, trading at $184. Its 24-hour low and high were $183 and $194, respectively. Coingape analysts reported the reason behind the Solana price dump . Meme Cryptocurrency Market Today Meme cryptocurrency market today is following the pattern of top altcoins. Dogecoin (DOGE) was down by 1%, trading at $0.3142, while Shiba Inu (SHIB) dropped by just half a percent in the last 24 hours. BONK, however, saw a 4% increase, with the “BURNmas” event contributing to the burn of over 1 trillion coins. Crypto Market Gainers Today Virtual Protocol Virtual Protocol (VIRTUAL) became the top gainer today, with its price jumping by 15% in the last 24 hours. Its 24-hour low and high were $3.05 and $3.58, respectively. Coingape analysts also reported the top cryptos to invest in for 2025. Bitget Token Bitget Token (BGB) price was up by 9% in the last 24 hours, trading at $8.36. The rise in price is mainly due to Bitget revealing plans for an $800 million token burn in the future. This development is affecting the crypto market today, driving positive momentum for Bitget Token. Crypto Market Losers Today FTX Token FTX Token (FTT) price was down by 16%, making it the worst-performing crypto in the last 24 hours. Its 24-hour low and high were $3.27 and $3.93, respectively. This decline reflects the challenges faced by FTX in the crypto market today. Zcash Zcash (ZEC) was down by 10%, trading at $61.72. Its 24-hour low and high were $61.61 and $68.92, respectively. This drop reflects the volatility in the crypto market today. Besides this, there has been no improvement in the hourly chart, and no major change in the price of top altcoins and Bitcoin in the last hour. Most likely, we will see significant price changes in the crypto market today next week, once the holiday period is over.

This move aims to provide investors new opportunities to leverage the Solana blockchain ecosystem. VolatilityShares Filled For Solana Futures ETF According to Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store VolatilityShares has recently proposed to launch a unique exchange-traded open-end index fund (ETF) based on Solana futures. As per the application, the proposed ETF will offer exposure to Solana futures with a variety of leverage options, including 1x, 2x, and -1x.

Something to watch as VolatilityShares pushed the SEC on ether futures ETFs. pic.twitter.com/lRs0XXMj5g — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) December 27, 2024 This diverse leverage structure is designed to cater to different risk appetites, enabling investors to potentially maximize their gains or hedge against market downturns. Solana ETF a Game-Changer? The proposed ETF will focus on Solana futures, trading exclusively on exchanges registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). This ensures a regulated and secure environment for investors, adding credibility to the crypto investment space. Solana, known for its lightning-fast transactions and low costs, has already captured the attention of the crypto community. If approved, this ETF could give investors a unique way to benefit from Solana’s growing ecosystem while catering to both risk-takers and cautious players. Volatility Shares Dual-Asset ETFs VolatilityShares is no stranger to innovation in the ETF market. The company previously introduced an innovative line of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that offer 100% leveraged exposure to two assets at once. This unique “one-plus-one” model allows investors to combine major asset classes like cryptocurrencies, stock indices, and market volatility in a single portfolio. The new ETFs include options such as BTC+ETH, Nasdaq+ETH, S&P+BTC, S&P+ETH, S&P+Nasdaq, and S&P+VIX, bridging the gap between traditional markets and digital assets.

Trump Cyborg (TRUMPCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCYB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Cyborg launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Cyborg on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Cyborg by entering its contract address – 9yaNQ89EaQ2nEDczZpuTZfDwfiYCxbwSYC4JeiWLDE57 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCYB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-28 04:12:00

Despite short-term declines, the cryptocurrency shows signs of stabilizing above a key support level. Recent Price Action Mirrors 2018 Trends Recent price movements have drawn comparisons to XRP’s behavior in 2018 when prices often surged beyond the upper Bollinger Band before retreating to the median line. XRP, which has dropped by approximately 5.18% over the past week, continues aligning with this historical pattern. Current projections suggest further declines could push the cryptocurrency to $2.103, a support level indicated by the lower Bollinger Band on the daily chart. According to data from CoinMarketCap, this would represent an additional 2.18% decrease from its current value of $2.15. Weekly Indicators Suggest Stabilization is Possible Despite these declines, the weekly Bollinger Bands present a more optimistic outlook. If the lower band on the weekly chart shifts upward, it could prevent XRP from falling to the grim $1 projection. This development would mitigate fears of a deeper decline and allow the cryptocurrency to consolidate above $2 soon. While uncertainty lingers, this potential stabilization provides hope for investors monitoring XRP’s performance closely. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Activity Signals Strength Amid Volatility XRP remains a key player in the cryptocurrency market, trading above $2 per token and holding the position of the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. With a market cap of $123 million and daily trading volumes reaching $4.67 billion, XRP’s activity underscores its resilience. These figures mark a significant turnaround compared to two months ago, highlighting how rapidly market dynamics can shift. While XRP’s current situation highlights opportunities and risks, its ability to hold above key support levels will determine its outlook. The weeks ahead will reveal whether XRP can capitalize on its current support level to mount a recovery or whether further declines are imminent. For now, market participants will continue to monitor the interplay between daily and weekly indicators to anticipate the next phase of price action. By staying above $2 and maintaining strong trading volumes, XRP is well-positioned to navigate this period of uncertainty, even as technical indicators point to potential short-term challenges.

Currently trading at $3,321, ETH’s resilience has been notable, especially amidst a broader market correction led by Bitcoin (BTC). This recent downturn has tested ETH’s critical support level at $3,290, effectively preventing a decline toward the psychologically significant $3,000 barrier. Could Ethereum Reach $14,000 By March 2025? Crypto expert Crypto Rover has made headlines with his bold prediction that ETH is poised for an “explosion” in the first quarter (Q1) of 2025. His confidence is bolstered by historical trends observed in previous Bitcoin Halving years, particularly in 2017 and 2021, where ETH experienced substantial double-digit increases from January through March. In 2017, Ethereum recorded impressive monthly gains of 31.9% in January, 48% in February, and a staggering 214% in March. Similarly, in 2021, ETH saw significant gains of 78.5% in January, 8.4% in February, and 34.7% in March. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reserve Idea Sparks Cautious Response From Japan PM: Report According to the expert’s analysis, these historical trends indicate that if Ethereum sustains its current price level for the rest of the year, it could experience a comparable path in 2025. Based on these historical figures and averages from the price increases between 2017 and 2021, it is possible that ETH might reach about $5,000 in January, around $6,400 in February, and by March, it could soar to $14,336 per token. Such increases would not only signify a recovery but also potentially triple Ethereum’s all-time high of $4,878 reached in November 2021. Beyond Ethereum, other altcoins such as XRP, Solana (SOL), Binance Coin (BNB), and even meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) are also expected to benefit from this market correction and consolidation. Crypto Rover has also cautioned altcoin holders, stating, “Now is the worst time to sell. Our portfolios still have the potential to do a 10x from here. The next three months are going to be incredible.” Key Support Levels For ETH’s Price In addition to these bullish predictions, analyst Gabriel Maur has weighed in on Ethereum’s current price action, emphasizing key support levels between $2,800 and $2,900. The analyst notes that the structure of support has transitioned into resistance, which, once broken, becomes a crucial support level. The upward trend indicated by the 55-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) further supports the bullish sentiment. Related Reading: Bitcoin $90K Level Is Crucial For Bulls – Price Could Tag $79K If BTC Loses It As long as ETH remains above this critical support region on weekly closes, the probability of continued upward momentum stays in favor of buyers. Maur identifies imminent targets of $4,093 and $4,868 (the previous all-time high), suggesting that if ETH closes above its all-time high, it may enter a price discovery phase with Fibonacci extensions indicating further upside potential.

This growth has reinforced investor confidence in cryptocurrencies and paved the way for broader acceptance within the financial markets. As institutional adoption gains momentum, the cryptocurrency landscape is set to evolve further. Bitcoin’s remarkable performance in 2024 has left a lasting impression on the financial world. This development has sparked renewed interest among both seasoned investors and newcomers eager to explore the cryptocurrency market.

Bitcoin’s Impact on the Financial Market The surge of Bitcoin in 2024 has undeniably shifted the dynamics of the financial market. By outperforming traditional assets such as stocks and gold, Bitcoin has proven its worth as a reliable investment option amidst economic uncertainty. This shift can be attributed to several factors, including growing institutional adoption and enhanced regulatory clarity, which have collectively bolstered investor confidence. Institutional investors, who were once skeptical of cryptocurrencies, are now showing increased interest in Bitcoin due to its potential for high returns. The presence of big players in the market has not only legitimized Bitcoin but has also provided a much-needed boost to its liquidity. Furthermore, clearer regulatory frameworks have alleviated some of the concerns surrounding security and legality, making it easier for investors to participate in the crypto market. This shift towards Bitcoin is indicative of a broader trend where digital currencies are becoming integral to diversified investment portfolios. As traditional financial institutions begin to embrace cryptocurrencies , people can expect further integration and acceptance within mainstream finance. This evolution is poised to redefine how people perceive and interact with money in the years to come. Cryptocurrency in Mainstream Finance The increasing acceptance of cryptocurrencies in mainstream finance marks a pivotal moment for digital currencies. In 2024 alone, several key developments have accelerated this trend. Notable among these is the integration of cryptocurrencies into payment systems by major corporations, enhancing their usability for everyday transactions. This mainstream acceptance is further underscored by the introduction of crypto-based financial products such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which provide a bridge between traditional finance and digital assets. These products offer retail investors easier access to cryptocurrencies without needing to directly purchase or manage them. As awareness grows, more individuals are likely to consider incorporating digital assets into their investment strategies. As cryptocurrencies become more embedded within conventional financial systems, their role as legitimate assets continues to solidify. This transition reflects changing consumer preferences and technological advancements that favor decentralized financial solutions over centralized ones. Future Outlook for Cryptocurrencies Looking ahead to 2025, there are both challenges and opportunities awaiting cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and altcoins. Technological advancements will continue driving innovation within blockchain networks while also addressing scalability issues that currently limit widespread adoption. Regulatory developments will play a crucial role in shaping future trends across global markets. However, greater transparency could lead to increased acceptance among regulators worldwide – ultimately benefiting long-term growth prospects within this dynamic industry sector. The convergence between technology companies investing heavily into blockchain research alongside existing financial institutions exploring new avenues presents exciting possibilities moving forward, bringing the world closer to realizing the full potential inherent within decentralized finance ecosystems today.

Del Mar Energy Inc. has patented a new technology,https://timestabloid.com/a-new-kind-of-alternative-energy-source-del-mar-energy-inc-has-patented-a-new-technology/,"Del Mar Energy Inc., a recognized leader in advanced energy technologies, has made a significant scientific breakthrough by proposing an innovative approach to energy generation that has the potential to fundamentally change the current energy paradigm. The developed methodology not only solves the problem of global energy supply, but also helps minimize environmental risks associated with traditional energy sources. The company’s key innovation is based on the use of piezoactive materials – complex composites that have the ability to convert mechanical vibrations into electric current. What makes the approach unique is the versatility of the technology, which allows energy to be extracted from a wide range of mechanical influences such as vehicle vibrations, acoustic waves and even human movement. This wide range of applications makes piezoactive materials a promising tool for energy systems of different scales – from stand-alone devices to large infrastructure facilities. At the official presentation, Del Mar Energy Inc.’s CEO, Michael Lattema, emphasized the strategic importance of the development, “We stand at the threshold of a new technological era. Our achievements are not only a scientific breakthrough, but also an opportunity to rethink the role of energy in ensuring the sustainable development of society”. One of the key characteristics of the new technology is its environmental neutrality. The process of producing and using piezoactive materials minimizes dependence on rare earth elements, which helps reduce the carbon footprint and vulnerability of global supply chains. In addition, an energy generation system based on these materials creates virtually no waste, making it environmentally friendly. Potential applications of the technology are already being actively discussed in expert circles. For example, it is proposed to use piezoactive materials in road surfaces, where energy can be generated by mechanical effects from vehicle traffic. Additionally, research is underway to integrate the technology into the architecture of energy-efficient buildings, which could partially power themselves through vibrations caused by wind loads or operational activity. Renewable energy experts praise the potential of this invention. Edward Hoffman, a professor of energy systems at Harvard University, said, “The technology proposed by Del Mar Energy Inc. opens new perspectives for the transition to sustainable energy. If it can be scaled and integrated into existing infrastructure, it will significantly reduce dependence on fossil fuels.” The company intends to launch pilot projects in three key markets – North America, Europe and Asia. Successful completion of testing will pave the way for mass adoption of the technology in the coming decades. Del Mar Energy Inc. estimates that their development will become an integral element of the global energy system based on the principles of sustainability and efficiency. Del Mar Energy Inc.’s achievement represents an outstanding example of the synergy of scientific research and innovative technologies aimed at solving global challenges. The company encourages the international community of scientists and engineers to collaborate to create an energy ecosystem capable of ensuring a sustainable future for all.

38213127,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=376077,1735362611,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/38213127.jpeg,The Top 100 Crypto Assets’ 6 Best Performers in 2024,https://cryptopotato.com/the-top-100-crypto-assets-6-best-performers-in-2024/,"Altcoins include all the other Internet currencies secured by cryptographic blockchains, in addition to Bitcoin, which is a seminal and first-in-class cryptocurrency. Their currency market exchange rates can vary with as much volatility as BTC and tend to track along with Bitcoin’s price. In fact, big rallies for BTC tend to lead to major bull runs in altcoin markets as well. Seasoned crypto day and swing traders refer to these movements as “alt season.” While Bitcoin posted a price gain of 121% from New Year’s Day to Christmas Eve this year, the following six altcoins saw increases ranging from 1,249% to a staggering 1.84 million percent for a latecomer to altcoin markets this year that only launched in October. Lower down in this article is the entire list of top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap ranked in order of gains they delivered from Jan. 1 through Dec. 24 this year. The author calculated these gains by taking the average crypto exchange price on Dec. 24 and dividing it by the average price on Jan. 1. Accordingly, some coins may be more or less profitable to day trade or swing trade than they appear on this list due to their market movements between the beginning and end dates for this calculation. Several of these coins would show much higher percentage gains if the end date were calculated from price peaks that happened earlier in the year. But here are the six that did best for investors who dollar cost average or hold long term. 1. Fartcoin Blew Investors Away This Year Fartcoin now valued at $1.2 Billion – what an explosion! pic.twitter.com/q53MnDbJwh — Barchart (@Barchart) December 24, 2024 The silent but violent creeper rally for Fartcoin blew away crypto markets this year. This hot meme coin is a fresh one. It began to rally right out the gate following its launch in mid-October. Following the November election, however, this Solana Program Library meme coin really ripped. Trump’s reelection saw most crypto markets rally, but Fartcoin posted a 300% gain in a matter of days from Nov. 5 through Nov. 18. Then in December, Fartcoin took another leg up to above $1 by Dec. 19. Now, Fartcoin is poised to run to $2 per token on popular Solana decentralized exchanges (DEX) like Radium and Meteroa VD. What could be behind such a hilarious meme economy? Perhaps it has something to do with the name Trump being a traditional slang term for a—well for—a Bronx cheer. In addition, this meme coin is the latest demonstration of the ease of use, low fees, and high liquidity for issuing new currency on the Solana network. The smart contract Layer 1 blockchain continues neck-and-neck with Ethereum in the race to dominate decentralized finance. From its debut through Dec. 24, Fartcoin’s price posted a percentage gain of 1,847,357%, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Who would have thought that a currency named Fartcoin would earn the highest percentage gains of any cryptocurrency in 2024? Anyone who’s been paying attention to the meme coin sector: These ragtag upstarts are decidedly the shock jocks of the digital finance industry. 2. MANTRA Bags Win For RWA Tokenization Several meme coins have flown up the price charts in 2024, but so also have altcoins with specific use cases and direct utility. That’s shown the market’s demand for currencies that power useful applications and artificial intelligence (AI). Mantra continued hitting new ATHs all year, in June, July, and October, and then surged to a major peak in November, which dwarfed all previous records. From January through December, this crypto gained the second most ROI out of any top 100 coin. Mantra’s (OM) crypto token is the currency that powers its Layer-1 blockchain focused on security and optimized for real-world asset tokenization (RWA). The platform is built from the ground up to comply with and enforce real-world regulatory requirements in accounting for real-world assets. Why Mantra’s Price Ratcheted Up In 2024 Launched in Q4 2020, Mantra has come a long way in the meantime. A big part of Mantra OM’s rise this year is its successful attainment of licensing from financial authorities to remain compliant with regulators as it expands to a global user base. Mantra secured licensing from authorities in the United Arab Emirates in addition to its license to operate and provide regulated financial services in Hong Kong. That will help it to become a key player in building a truly global “Internet of Things.” In June, Mantra’s (OM) tokens achieved an all-time high of $1.09. Moreover, this was a remarkable milestone because the rest of the cryptocurrency market was in a slump at the time. That milestone came as a result of a partnership between Mantra and the UAE’s Zand Bank. The two are collaborating to define clear frameworks for RWA tokenization that comply with the Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority of Dubai. After that, OM hit another all-time record high in October. That came after Mantra’s price surged more than 60% in under 30 days to nearly $1.50 with a total market cap of $1.2 billion. Overall, Mantra (OM)’s price gained 8,776% on crypto markets from Jan. to Dec. this year. 3. Virtuals Protocol Wins Crypto AI Meta Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) is a new Layer-2 decentralized protocol that works across blockchain L1s and the Web 1.0 and 2.0 layers. But its main feature is the tokenized, decentralized creation and management of “AI agents.” These artificially intelligent agents can be deployed from the blockchain to social media apps like Telegram and to online games and metaverses—hence the name Virtuals. As a result of its enormous increases, the token for Virtuals Protocol was the third biggest gainer in 2024. From Jan. 1 to Dec. 24, VIRTUAL grew in price by 6,068%. 4. Ondo, Another Sweep for RWA Tokenization Markets heavily rewarded real-world asset tokenization in 2024. They also liked currency platforms with other specific, unique, and valuable use cases (think Render token and AIOZ Network). The appearance, however, of not one but two different RWA tokens in the six leading cryptos by ROI in 2024 underscores the promise of this segment. Ondo is another RWA token that saw posted big gains. Ondo tokens allow users to participate in its decentralized autonomous organization and have special perks for users of Flux Finance, which is governed by Ondo DAO. Altcoin traders know that winners tend to win again. Ondo hit new all-time high exchange rates in April , March, and May before doing so again in December . That supported its class-leading gains this year. Ondo’s price increased from Jan. 1 to Dec. 24 by 1,758%. 5. Aerodome Chalks Boon For Decentralized Exchanges Utility and memes hauled the most annual ROI in 2024. Utility strikes again with Aerodome, an automated market maker (AMM) for Coinbase’s Ethereum Layer-2 platform, Base. Aerodrome works by serving Base’s central liquidity hub with a clever liquidity incentive engine governed by a decentralized consensus model. Exchange rates for its AERO tokens took flight this year. Listed on crypto exchanges starting in Aug. 2023, Aerodome (AERO) hit soaring ATHs in Mar. and Apr. this year. The AMM altcoin did it again in Dec.. From Jan. 1 to Dec. 24, AERO notched 1,672%. 6.

She filed some grave charges against Akridge for using her blockchain expertise to take millions of dollars worth of staking rewards from her Solana holdings. According to the lawsuit, Akridge allegedly controlled her crypto accounts between March and May, taking all the staking commissions for himself. The couple ended their 10-year marriage in February 2023. Rossi has filed a lawsuit accusing Akridge of breaking agreements, unfairly benefiting from her money, and committing fraud. She is asking for compensation for the financial losses she says he caused her. Co-founded by Stephen Akridge, along with Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal, Solana has played a key role in advancing decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 technologies. Akridge, who previously worked at Qualcomm, was a principal engineer at Solana and is now the CEO of Cyber Grant, a cybersecurity company. A Complex Crypto Case The case highlights the challenges of managing crypto assets in personal disputes. Staking rewards are a popular way for crypto holders to earn passive income, with Solana offering annual yields of 5.6% to 12%. Liquid staking platforms like Jito make this even more attractive by allowing users to earn extra rewards through decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Community Reactions and Next Steps So far, neither Akridge nor Solana Labs has commented on the allegations. The lawsuit has drawn attention from the crypto community, involving personal and financial disputes tied to the rapidly growing blockchain space. As Solana continues to grow in the DeFi world, this case reminds us of the importance of clear asset management, especially in high-stakes environments like crypto. The outcome of this legal battle could set a precedent for how similar cases are handled. With Solana ETFs on the way, such negative news can impact future adoptions raising questions on crypto integrity.",News|Crypto Scam,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|SOL,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-28 05:16:44

Blockchain tracker Whale Alert detected the transfer of nearly three trillion SHIB tokens, an event linked to BTCTurk, Turkey’s second-largest centralized cryptocurrency exchange. The movement of such a significant amount of SHIB has sparked discussion and speculation about its purpose. Massive SHIB Transaction Uncovered The transaction involved the transfer of 2,884,590,622,344 SHIB tokens, valued at approximately $65.7 million. Whale Alert identified the funds as being moved from BTCTurk to an anonymous wallet. On-chain data reveals that the transfer occurred within the past 17 hours. This movement of one of the most recognized meme coins has captured the attention of crypto enthusiasts, with some suggesting it could involve a large holder, or “whale,” moving their assets. BTCTurk, however, clarified that the transfer was part of routine operations. A statement says, “these transfers are fully managed by us, and there is nothing out of the ordinary.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Additional Transactions and Speculation The SHIB transfer was not the only large movement tracked by Whale Alert. The platform also reported three significant Ethereum (ETH) transactions from BTCTurk. These transfers included 23,285 ETH, 20,000 ETH, and another 20,000 ETH, collectively valued at $220 million. BTCTurk explained that these transactions were part of their “wallet optimization efforts.” Despite this clarification, some crypto community members speculated about the nature of these movements, with concerns raised about the possibility of a security breach. The exchange responded to these speculations directly under Whale Alert’s posts, reiterating that the transfers were internal and standard operational procedures. SHIB Metaverse Launches on Shibarium Meanwhile, the Shiba Inu team has made progress on a long-awaited project. The SHIB Metaverse is now accessible for early users through the Shibarium blockchain. This development marks a significant milestone for the SHIB ecosystem after years of preparation by the team, including the pseudonymous leader, Shytoshi Kusama. Users can now connect their wallets to the Metaverse, claim virtual land plots, and explore various features. This virtual environment allows users to construct homes, explore temples, interact with nature, and participate in community-building activities. The launch represents a significant step in expanding the utility of SHIB beyond its meme coin origins. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Dogecoin remains the leading crypto in the meme coin ecosystem. A recent change in fortune has seen the Dogecoin price drop by over 20%, but the Dogecoin bulls are fighting back. Meanwhile, DOGE investors are looking at Lunex Network , a new decentralized finance (DeFi) token, as a viable crypto investment to diversify their portfolios. Currently in presale, Lunex has raised over $5.5 million and there’s more to come. Let’s find out why investors are bullish on the relatively unknown crypto project before launch. A DOGE alternative is a great idea for investors While the numbers look good for DOGE presently, the meme coin faces a challenge – it’s a coin backed by social media hype from influential personalities like Elon Musk. That means a slowdown in its hype could result in less demand for the meme token, especially since competitors like PEPE and WIF have higher gains. That’s why utility-backed assets like Lunex are great options for Dogecoin investors. The Lunex Network is already showing how much utility has on price growth with its presale , which has raised over $5.5 million. What are these use cases? First, the Lunex ecosystem has a cross-chain DEX that supports trading across multiple blockchain networks. With over 50,000 crypto pairs, the DEX prevents liquidity issues for DeFi traders and investors. There’s also a self-custodial wallet to store any of the supported cryptocurrencies. With support for over 40 blockchains and thousands of assets, it’s easy to store and manage funds on a single device. Moreover, Lunex token holders can stake their coins for up to 18% APY. These exciting features make Lunex a great crypto investment for investors. Interestingly, the ongoing presale provides a limited-time opportunity for interested investors to stack up LNEX tokens at a discounted rate of $0.0048. Dogecoin maintains pole position in the meme coin market Dogecoin has been in the news after its year-on-year growth of over 250%. However, the recent price drop in the broader crypto market saw its market cap threatened. After falling into the red zone in the past week, the DOGE price and market cap are now back up. For context, the Dogecoin price is down by about 13% in recent days. However, DOGE bulls have been fighting back, evident through its rebounding price. Similarly, the DOGE market cap has increased by over 3% within the same period per data from CoinMarketCap, reinforcing the coin’s position as the top meme cryptocurrency by market capitalization. However, there’s still a long way to go for DOGE to turn around the losses from the past weeks into gains. Can DOGE reach $1 in 2025? There have been different DOGE price predictions ahead of the new year. Many believe that DOGE will move from its current price of less than $1 to be the next meme coin to reach $1. The optimistic DOGE price prediction makes it a potentially rewarding crypto investment for investors and traders looking for short-term gains. The potential increase will be influenced by factors like Elon Musk and his social media hype, Donald Trump’s new administration, and increased demand for DOGE among traders.

CIFR's strategic growth includes significant capacity increases in Texas, with new facilities like Black Pearl and Stingray, enhancing mining efficiency and computational power. Despite cash burn concerns, CIFR's low production costs and high gross margins position it well to capitalize on the ongoing cryptocurrency bull market. I upgrade CIFR to a ""Buy"" due to its growth potential in Bitcoin, AI, and HPC markets, though investors should expect high volatility. Cipher Mining Inc. ( CIFR ) is currently working towards strengthening its positioning among Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining and high-performance computing [HPC] infrastructure. To this end, CIFR focuses on obtaining low-cost energy and operational efficiencies as it builds its data center capacity. CIFR’s growing mining fleet is also adapting to the challenges of the 2024 Bitcoin halving and potentially volatile market conditions. So far, CIFR’s operations have increased with the acquisition and development of new facilities. Its target is to reach 23.5 EH/s by the end of 2025. Similarly, the company believes its business is also a good fit for the emerging AI and HPC market trends. For instance, Meta ( META ) and Nvidia ( NVDA ) use CIFR’s infrastructure. So I lean bullish on CIFR’s as it has a low-cost production model backed by secular tailwinds with high Bitcoin prices. More than a Miner: Business Overview Cipher Mining Inc. is a technology and infrastructure company that develops and operates data centers designed for Bitcoin mining. It also uses excedent energy monetization by providing infrastructure for Artificial Intelligence [AI] and High-Performance Computing [HPC] tasks. Source: Corporate Presentation. October 31, 2024. Since my previous analysis , CIFR has made surprising progress as it scaled its operations ahead of the 2024 Bitcoin [BTC] halving. This is why CIFR is now able to reap the rewards from those strategic decisions, as Bitcoin mining rewards are now cut by half, which typically heralds a secular bull market in cryptocurrencies. Texas Play: Strategic Growth Moreover, CIFR successfully increased its capacity by 300 MW with its 70-acre Black Pearl facility in Texas. This will essentially increase the efficiency and hash rate it uses to provide its mining and computing services. CIFR’s goal is to reach a production of 23.5 exahash per second [EH/s] by the end of 2025, which would basically make CIFR a leader in its industry. Thus, CIFR’s Black Pearl site’s production will contribute to this goal by enabling more mining rigs and boosting the computational power rate. The data center at the Black Pearl site is under construction and scheduled to be operational in Q2 2025. Source: Corporate Presentation. October 31, 2024. Additionally, on November 26, 2024, CIFR announced the acquisition of another 250-acre site in Stingray, West Texas. As you may have noticed, Texas is a sector with low-cost energy resources, which is ideal for CIFR’s business model. The company disclosed it paid $4.1 million upfront and signed the agreement to a variable fee of $1.5 per megawatt-hour [MWh] for five years after the site started operations. The variable cost is linked to the amount of energy CIFR’s installation consumes from the grid. After all, this site is directly connected to the main power grid with an agreement with ONCOR that will be fully supplied by 1H2026. Mining Efficiency and Future Expansion Furthermore, on December 03, 2024, the company recently disclosed that 202 Bitcoins were mined in November. This included 30 Bitcoins mined at joint venture data centers and 13 Bitcoins from excess electricity monetized at $96,542 per Bitcoin. In other words, in that single month, it generated roughly $19.5 million in revenues, which implies an impressive annual revenue run rate of $234.0 million. However, CIFR actually sold 234 Bitcoin to manage its liquidity and still held another 1,383 Bitcoin in its treasury. In fact, it has 258 Bitcoin as collateral to ensure its financial operations. Additionally, CIFR has 76,000 mining rigs deployed, with 12.0 EH/s, which is close to their year-end 2024 target of 13.5 EH/s for bitcoin mining. Likewise, its fleet’s efficiency (energy consumption per terahash) was 20.8 joules per terahash [J/TH], slightly less than the projected value of 18.9 J/TH. So, while CIFR seems to have come in slightly below its internal projections, it’s still benefiting immensely from the ongoing bull market in Bitcoin. Source: Corporate Presentation. October 31, 2024. It’s also worth mentioning that CIFR’s Odessa site has upgrades that should be ready by year-end 2024. If they materialize, it could place its operations among the industry’s most efficient mining fleets. This matters because, together with the Black Pearl site, the new Stingray facility, and a total of 11 sites, CIFR would reach a total power pipeline of 2.6 GW by 2027. Bitcoin and HPC Markets Currently, the Bitcoin mining industry reported record-low hash prices in Q3 2024, which translated into reduced revenues. However, CIFR mitigated these headwinds with its low-cost units, which are as low as $0.027/kWH. This means that in 2024, the company achieved an all-in cost of production for one Bitcoin of approximately $18,162. This production cost implies an extraordinarily favorable ROIC, as Bitcoin trades multiple times higher than that. Note that these costs already include energy, grid fees, and other energy-linked expenses. Moreover, CIFR’s Odessa has the lowest electricity cost per Bitcoin, approximately $17,561. This facility is the company’s primary production hub and contributes around 83% of its Bitcoin mining operations. The rest of its mining comes from joint venture facilities with higher costs than Odessa, with a mean cost per Bitcoin of $22,928. Source: Corporate Presentation. October 31, 2024. CIFR is currently among the leading Bitcoin miners in terms of Bitcoin production costs. For comparison, miners such as the giant Marathon Digital Holdings ( MARA ) had an average electricity cost of $22,000 to $24,000 per BTC. Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) had a power-related cost average of around $26,000 . However, RIO has higher than CIFR’s mining costs, averaging approximately $20,000 per BTC. Hut 8 Mining ( HUT ) is closer to CIFR because it also aims to be a diversified company that offers HPC workloads. But again, HUT’s costs are around $31,482 per Bitcoin mined as of Q3 2024. Moreover, in hash rate terms, CIFR’s target of 35 EH/s with fleet efficiency of 15 J/TH by year-end 2025 would only strengthen its cost advantage due to low energy costs and operational efficiency. Source: Corporate Presentation. October 31, 2024. According to its latest earnings call , the company plans on expanding its capacity to 927 MW in 2025. For this, it’ll increase by 866 MW with new facilities, like the Black Pearl, as it becomes operational. The increase in capacity from 327 MW in 2024 to 927 MW in 2025 is part of the company’s strategy to grow and produce Bitcoins as efficiently as possible. Furthermore, CIFR is leveraging its large sites, fast energization, and the use of its data centers by major companies like McKinsey, Meta, and Nvidia. In fact, the company believes it can become a key player in the HPC and AI markets. This is why CIFR is actually well-positioned to capitalize on the current power scarcity and support computing loads for these types of corporate tasks. In a way, CIFR’s mining operations give it a unique set of competitive advantages to fulfill those requirements. Diversification with AI and HPC is key because it’ll transform CIFR from a pure-miner play closer to a general computing firm. Mining is highly profitable during a bull market, but AI and HPC are much more stable with recurring revenue streams, which lowers CIFR’s exposure to Bitcoin’s cyclicality. You see, most of CIFR’s data centers, like the Odessa site, have Application-Specific Integrated Circuit [ASIC] mining rigs designed for cryptocurrency mining. However, the newer projects like the Black Pearl and Stingray facilities are developed to support dual purposes including Bitcoin mining and colocation agreements for AI and HPC tenants. Source: CME. These tenants use GPUs and other specialized equipment requiring specific cooling systems, high bandwidth, and redundant power supplies. The company plans to integrate its AI and HPC capacities into its broader 2.6 GW total power potential by 2027, which indicates an emphasis on the new focus of its portfolio. But it also shows its business will be much more flexible going forward. For instance, industry data suggests AI inference workloads can generate $7 in revenue for every $1 spent on GPU over four years. This is likely significantly higher than Bitcoin mining’s ROI during a bear market. So, dedicating a fraction of its capacity to HPC tasks lets CIFR tap into that growing global AI market . Computing demand from that sector is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 37% from 2024 to 2030. It’s also worth highlighting that on December 16, 2024, Bitcoin hit a record-high price of $106,449. For instance, the US elections were a positive catalyst for the price of Bitcoin because President Trump has repeatedly signaled a favorable stance towards this industry. Also, the Fed is on a rate-cutting cycle , which should act as an additional tailwind for asset prices as well. The CME rate probability tool suggests there’s an 82.7% aggregate probability of lower rates by December 2025. In my opinion this will give a macro environment for CIFR’s business. Relatively Cheap: Valuation Analysis From a valuation perspective, CIFR trades at a $1.9 billion market cap. This means the company is no longer a microcap, but I also believe there’s still more room to grow as long as the cryptocurrency secular bull market continues. As of Q3 2024, CIFR’s balance sheet held $25.3 million in cash and short-term investments against no financial debt other than typical operating liabilities. I also see its balance sheet also has $95.5 million worth of Bitcoin. Its equity book value reached $672.0 million, suggesting a P/B of 2.3. This actually appears reasonable compared to its sector’s median P/B of 3.5. Source: Seeking Alpha. According to Seeking Alpha’s dashboard on CIFR, CIFR is projected to generate $301.1 million in revenues by 2025. Naturally, we need to take these projects with a grain of salt because they rely substantially on the price of Bitcoin. As long as the current cryptocurrency bull market continues, it should be a realistic projection, but I believe its long-term revenue growth will be highly volatile because the underlying commodity is highly erratic as well. Investment Caveats and Risk Analysis Nonetheless, $301.1 million in future revenues implies a forward P/S of 6.3. This is actually slightly higher than its sector’s median forward P/S of 3.3. Still, I believe the main metric to track is CIFR’s gross margins, which should capture its Bitcoin production cost relative to the price it realizes when monetizing it. Currently, CIFR’s gross margins stand at 62.3%, which is significantly higher than its sector’s gross margins of 51.0%. However, we can’t ignore that if CIFR’s infrastructure expansion somehow leads to higher production costs, it could hit substantially its margins. Similarly, if the price of Bitcoin declines substantially, it could lead to equally large shareholder losses. Investors need to fully understand that, for now, CIFR remains largely a derivative on the price of Bitcoin itself. In the long run, CIFR’s operations might diversify more into other areas like AI and HPC computing, but for now, it’s still largely a miner and nothing more. As with other mining companies, as long as the underlying commodity rallies, the stock will likely follow as well. But the inverse is also true, so new investors need to understand this is a highly cyclical security by nature. Source: CIFR’s latest 10-Q. Another potential red flag is that CIFR’s cash burn remains persistent despite its secular tailwinds. I estimate CIFR’s trailing nine-month cash burn reached $224.5 million by adding its CFOs and Net CAPEX. This figure includes its intangible asset purchases and Bitcoin sales. Clearly, CIFR has made substantial CAPEX investments expecting to monetize them into 2025, but if the price of Bitcoin declines, it could also lead to massive losses for investors. Source: TradingView. Nevertheless, on balance, I believe it’s fair to lean bullish on CIFR, as it’s focused on growing its operations to capitalize on a multitude of highly promising secular trends (Bitcoin, AI, HPC computing). Hence, I feel it’s fair to upgrade CIFR to a “Buy” for investors who understand this will be a volatile security. “Buy” Upgrade: Conclusion Overall, I believe CIFR has outpaced my initial expectations, which is why I feel it deserves a rating upgrade. In particular, I like its pivot towards potentially diversifying its business in the long run with AI and HPC computing. Also, as long as the ongoing cryptocurrency bull market persists, the company seems well-positioned to continue creating shareholder value. I do have some cash burn concerns, but if Bitcoin rallies more into 2025, then I anticipate CIFR will generate substantial revenues that will allow it to recoup its 2024 CAPEX. Thus, I rate CIFR a “Buy” for investors who understand this is a highly cyclical and volatile stock closely linked to the price of Bitcoin itself.",BTC-USD|CIFR|CIFRW,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-12-28 05:31:21

Prince Elon (ELONPRIN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONPRIN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Prince Elon can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Prince Elon could become the next viral memecoin. Prince Elon launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Prince Elon on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Prince Elon by entering its contract address – 7rAsmWGTtPFY9RFnhd9biard7PrWtw5ZigowwfmaXUQ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONPRIN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-28 05:32:00

The pullback may be scary to some, but that’s just what happens in the crypto market. As these coins go through hard times, savvy investors are turning to Lunex Network and its trailblazing presale. This project is turning heads and has an explosive potential that would see it rise to unprecedented levels. That is why many have dubbed it the fastest growing crypto token today. Lunex Network Presale Keeps Soaring Higher Lunex Network is a brand new presale that is shaking things up pretty well right now. Even though it debuted just a couple of months ago, it has raised over $5.5 million from investors. In addition to that, 2.5 trillion tokens have been sold in the presale, since everyone wants a piece of it. The major reason investors are going in on Lunex is its potential for accelerated growth. The protocol champions crypto swaps across multiple blockchain networks, which is a groundbreaking feature in the DEX arena. To top that, Lunex favors community growth and development. This is evident in its staking rewards and revenue sharing strategies. Lunex tokens are purchased from the open market and a portion of this is shared amongst LNEX holders as staking rewards. In this manner, LNEX rewards loyal holders and simultaneously fosters a strong community. These features combine to paint a stellar future for the project. The Lunex presale is available for $0.0048 but it is billed to appreciate by 800% before the presale ends. This is why several experts have called it the fastest growing crypto of the moment. Will Chainlink Price Weather The Crypto Storm? Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that is very important for the efficient execution of smart contracts. But this has not spared Chainlink price from the latest market correction. LINK has shed just about 15% from its peak in early December and now consolidates around $242. Despite the current slump, analysts still have a positive outlook for Chainlink. Technical indicators continue to show bullish LINK predictions. Given Chainlink’s importance to smart contracts, there’s a good chance of a LINK resurgence. Toncoin Slides Dangerously After November Boom TON is the native token of the Telegram Open Network (TON), and its November rally has drawn genuine interest from investors. But since the last market correction, Toncoin has shed significant portions of its value, and TON holders are starting to get concerned. To put things into perspective, TON fell by as much as 15% over the last couple of weeks and it has been on a downward trend since the market correction. Despite the temporary setback, experts maintain conservative optimism about TON’s future. But it’s better to take this optimism with a pinch of salt. Join the fastest growing crypto train Owing to their struggles after the last market correction, investors aren’t too keen on TON and Chainlink. This dip didn’t affect Lunex Network since it’s a crypto presale, and that is why it is a highly recommended investment option. Lunex Network is starting a revolutionary movement, and it’s only a matter of time before it goes viral. Joining the Lunex train before it hits the limelight could fetch investors profits in excess of 10,000%. No one should miss out on it.

Regulatory changes and a crypto-friendly SEC leadership could enhance Bitcoin ETF efficiency, making IBIT more appealing and reducing costs for investors. Short-term volatility persists, but demand-supply dynamics and miners' HODLing behavior support a bullish outlook for Bitcoin and IBIT by 2025. IBIT offers a convenient way for investors to gain crypto exposure without direct ownership hassles, benefiting from BlackRock's management and liquidity. After a 15% dive from its mid-December peak of $60.7, the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) trades around $53.5. It has heftily outperformed the S&P 500 this year, showing crypto's resiliency in a highly volatile year, as highlighted by the orange chart below. seekingalpha.com After the election of a crypto-friendly President and powerful rhetoric like elevating Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) to become a national reserve asset, its value crossed the psychological $100K level about two weeks back. However, Jerome Powell's subsequently making unfavorable comments about the Fed's ability to hold digital assets, and sounding hawkish on monetary policy did send prices lower. In such a context, while volatility risks should persist in the short term, this thesis aims to paint a bullish outlook for 2025 based mainly on demand-supply economics. Also, after recent comments by one of the SEC’s commissioners, there is likely to be a policy shift towards crypto which may enhance BTC's appeal and improve the tracking efficiency of ETFs investing in the digital asset. Changes in Crypto Regulations Could Benefit IBIT First, looking at the leadership change at the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission), the current Chair Gary Gensler is preparing to vacate his position. While he can be credited with approving several Bitcoin ETFs in January this year, this came only after he faced legal pressure. For this matter, a U.S. appeal court ruled in favor of Grayscale's application to convert its Bitcoin Trust into a spot ETF in August 2023, a move that was initially opposed by U.S. regulators. Therefore with Gensler's departure, there are expectations of a more supportive regulatory environment for crypto investments. This is especially so because Paul Atkins who has been nominated by President-Elect Trump as his replacement has experience in financial services including crypto and regulatory compliance since he served as one of the SEC's commissioners from 2002 to 2008. Also, he currently leads Patomak Global Partners, a financial compliance consultancy company, and is co-chair of the Token Alliance , an industry-led initiative of the Chamber of Digital Commerce. Since the alliance focuses on connecting crypto exchanges with blockchain projects, it shows Atkins' commitment to fostering innovation in the blockchain-based payment world. Tellingly, this is an area where the U.S. is behind other developed countries, and, in addition to providing more balanced regulatory oversight (in contrast to his predecessor), Mr. Atkins possesses the qualifications necessary for making sweeping changes. Thus, from strict regulation , regulators may be more open to deep crypto-related regulatory changes, a possibility supported by Commissioner Hester Peirce who indicated that under new leadership, the SEC may revise key decisions on crypto ETFs and in-kind redemptions . Well, these would allow ETF investors to redeem (sell) their shares for the underlying digital asset, for example, Bitcoin instead of going through cash. In other words, in-kind redemptions could enable the exchange of ETF shares for crypto, which could then be transferred to a wallet. This is also synonymous with more efficient transactions and eliminates costs (trading and taxation) associated with cash transactions for those wishing to convert their Bitcoins to ETF shares As a result, this can improve tracking efficiency or the degree to which an ETF's market price is aligned with its NAV. In this way, IBIT can track Bitcoin price movements more closely potentially reducing the 20% performance gap as shown below. seekingalpha.com Looking further, direct exchanges of ETF shares for crypto could potentially enhance liquidity in the ecosystem, in turn leading to lower costs for fund managers namely by avoiding the buy/sell spreads normally associated with converting Bitcoins to cash. Consequently, if these cost savings are passed on to investors, in-kind redemptions could lead to lower expense ratios, but this ultimately depends on the funds' structure and objectives. Volatility Risks are likely to Persist in the short term but Therefore, innovation, whereby Bitcoin is used for purposes other than storing value, can lead to more demand while in-kind redemption can increase efficiency gains in turn increasing the appeal of spot ETFs like IBIT. However, this cannot happen overnight or just by changing one rule. The reason is in-kind redemption introduces other challenges like having sufficient Bitcoin liquidity (compared to cash before), especially during volatile market conditions. The reason is a liquid market reduces the bid-ask spread and increases the efficiency of the trading experience each time there is a transaction, or a buy at the offer or sell at the bid. Also, for the mechanism to function well, the custody risks associated with transferring large volumes have to be addressed to avoid incidents like the Ronin Network hack (2022) involving $600 million worth of coins being lost. In the same vein, using blockchain and cryptocurrencies to allow people to transact directly should also incorporate risk mitigation strategies because of scams and hacks and millions of dollars of losses suffered. Therefore, it may take some time before crypto-friendly measures are implemented and in the meantime, due to high expectations, there may be further volatility, a possibility supported by the price situated below the 10-day moving average and the RSI of 55 being overbought territory at the time of writing (chart below). The momentum (www.seekingalpha.com) However, looking beyond the short term, as far as Bitcoin trades above the $80K break-even level, miners who are essential components of the ecosystem as the producers of digital assets should continue to stay profitable. Demand-supply economics is Favorable to Digital Asset Prices This suggests they can obtain relatively more cash per Bitcoin they sell on the open market to finance their operations, in turn allowing them to HODL or hold more coins in their treasuries, thereby reducing supply. Ultimately, this supports digital asset prices. On the other hand, Jerome Powell has said that the Fed cannot hold Bitcoins, which somewhat goes against Trump’s intent of creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve. This may have reduced crypto allure in the minds of some investors and possibly contributed to BTC falling off its mid-December peak of $106K. Another contributory factor that also negatively impacted the broader market is interest rates likely to stay higher longer in 2025 as the fight against inflation lingers on. This makes the cost of capital dearer for miners planning to refinance or invest in new and more efficient equipment. Thus, in case asset prices fall further, miners may be constrained to sell more Bitcoins, resulting in more supply and pressurizing prices. However, this is currently not the case with a top crypto analyst stating that the BTC market is increasingly dominated by the HODLing sentiment since miners believe its value will go higher. Now, in the rapidly shifting dynamics of the crypto market, miners HODLing their Bitcoins is key as it means less supply is likely to reach the markets, implying that as long as demand is sustained, asset prices could rise. To come up with an estimate, I consider that currently, Bitcoin hovers around the $96K level which is near my prediction of $95.4K calculated some six weeks earlier in my previous thesis on the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA: BITO ). At that time, I used a multiplier of 9.18%, a figure obtained after accounting for past inflows, liquidity conditions, and price elasticity. Again, using the same multiplier and incrementing BTC's current value of 96K by 9.18%, I obtain a target of $104.8K or roughly $105K. Making the case for an investment in IBIT, Amid Volatility Now, by holding Bitcoin directly, IBIT tracks the digital asset's price movements closely. Thus, its shares should also gain, but, this time, I multiply its current share price of $53.5 by 7.34% (or 80% of 9.18%) to take into account IBIT's approximately 20% of deviation from Bitcoin's price. Hence, I obtained a target of $57.4, which represents only a modest upside of around 7% but is justified because of the risks. www.ishares.com One of these could be momentum-related or failure to sustainably break through the key resistance level of $100K, thereby causing selling pressure. Second, Bitcoin remains rate-sensitive not only because higher borrowing costs impact the finances of miners as mentioned earlier but also because higher interests could shift investor mindset to becoming more risk-averse. Thus, they could dump riskier digital assets like Bitcoin alongside growth stocks like tech and flock to value stocks. Third, with the investment products around BTC growing in sophistication, hackers may be tempted to target more vulnerable components of the ecosystem including crypto wallets, and exchanges. Talking of exchanges, any occurrence of an FTX-style scandal can be highly detrimental to the trust factor. Fourth, any news update about Bitcoin used for illicit activities as earlier emphasized by Gensler may undermine regulatory efforts to bring changes, especially innovation. Still, we are at a uniquely favorable juncture for Bitcoin with a Republican- controlled Congress , increasing crypto ownership among Americans, ETF-led adoption, and strong network effects, implying the cryptocurrency can rise further. Add to this drastically lower Bitcoin issuance, or the number of units awarded to miners which has dropped to around 412 daily from 943 before the April halving, implying more scarcity. Equally important, a more favorable regulatory environment could increase the efficiency of ETF transactions and reduce costs. For this purpose, IBIT is already trusted by many who want crypto exposure but without enduring the hassles of direct ownership, such as subscribing to an exchange and owning a wallet. Finally, another advantage is it is managed by giant asset manager BlackRock ( BLK ) and comes with better liquidity and trading volumes given its sizable assets under management. This is more than 2.5 times higher than its two closest peers Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ) and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ) as shown below, making it easier for large investors to enter or exit positions. www.seekingalpha",IBIT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-12-28 05:47:25

Starting in 2027, DeFi platforms will have to collect user trading information, issue tax forms, and provide customer details like names and addresses. This rule is meant to make digital asset taxes similar to traditional ones. However, some experts worry that this could be tough for decentralized platforms since they don’t have centralized entities to collect this data. This change is part of the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, but it’s facing opposition from crypto groups. Why Experts are Against the Rule? Crypto industry leaders are pushing back against the IRS’s new rule that treats decentralized exchanges (DeFi platforms) like traditional brokers. Uniswap’s Chief Legal Officer, Katherine Minarik, and CEO, Hayden Adams, both argue that the rule should be challenged, with Adams hoping it will be rejected through the Congressional Review Act. Yep, @CampbellJAustin beat me to it.

Recent Reserves And Netflows Indicate Market Reversal,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/is-the-tide-turning-for-bitcoin-recent-reserves-and-netflows-indicate-market-reversal/,"Analysts from the market intelligence company CryptoQuant note that current patterns in Bitcoin (BTC) metrics indicate possible changes in market dynamics. Bitcoin Price Faces Short-Term Volatility After a period of steady decline, spot exchange reserves have experienced a notable uptick, reflecting an inflow of 20,000 BTC. This increase suggests that more Bitcoin is being deposited into exchanges, which often indicates an intention to trade or sell. This type of behavior may add further selling pressure to the Bitcoin price, which has declined almost 7% over the last two weeks, signaling a potential early sign of short-term volatility. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Struggles to Hold Ground: Another Drop Incoming? Simultaneously, netflows across all exchanges have turned positive, with a net increase of 15,800 BTC. This reversal from the predominantly negative trend seen in recent weeks implies that inflows to exchanges are now exceeding outflows. When combined with rising reserves, this shift strengthens the likelihood of increased trading activity or profit-taking by investors, according to CryptoQuant’s analysis. While the broader trend in the market has favored accumulation and self-custody, these recent changes may reflect a growing caution among investors, who might be preparing for profit-taking or bracing for a potential price correction. Furthermore, a report by Bloomberg highlights a key metric gauging investor interest in Bitcoin from South Korea, which has risen to a four-month high amid ongoing political turmoil in the East Asian country. Trading Volumes Surge As Political Crisis Unfolds Known as the “Kimchi Premium,” this metric measures the price gap between Bitcoin on South Korean exchange Upbit and Coinbase. Recently, this premium surged to the range of 3-5%, indicating heightened demand from South Korean investors. Per the report, the political landscape in South Korea has been tumultuous, particularly following President Yoon Suk Yeol’s brief and controversial declaration of martial law earlier this month, which lasted only six hours before being rescinded. Subsequently, the National Assembly impeached Yoon on December 14, suspending his powers and elevating Prime Minister Han Duck-soo to the role of acting president. In a further development, the parliament voted to impeach Han as well, marking a historic first for an acting president in South Korea. These political upheavals have rattled financial markets, coinciding with growing economic challenges and increasing nuclear threats from North Korea. The South Korean won has also seen a decline of 0.35% against the US dollar. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Setting For a Big Move – Breakout Or Downturn? According to Bloomberg, South Korea remains one of the most active retail markets for cryptocurrencies, with trading volumes on Korea-based exchanges often surpassing those on traditional stock exchanges. Ki Young Ju, founder and CEO of CryptoQuant, pointed out that corporate accounts are not permitted on Korean crypto exchanges, meaning that the vast majority of crypto activity in the country is driven by retail investors. The Kimchi Premium has become a well-known metric for measuring retail interest in cryptocurrency, and factors such as strict currency controls and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations have contributed to this phenomenon. At the time of writing, BTC is priced at $93,938, experiencing a 2.5% decrease over the last 24 hours, with its closest support level at $92,000 serving to halt additional declines for the top cryptocurrency in the market.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-will-dominate-2025-analyst-claims-heres-why/,"A recent tweet by prominent cryptocurrency analyst BarriC has generated significant discussion within the XRP community . The analyst predicts substantial growth for XRP in 2025, suggesting that the current period offers a valuable accumulation opportunity. This article will analyze BarriC’s claims, considering supporting factors and recent market activity. XRP To Dominate 2025 BarriC’s tweet asserts that XRP will “dominate 2025.” This prediction is coupled with a specific timeframe for accumulation, suggesting that the current price range of $2-$2.30 in 2024 represents a “cheap” entry point. The analyst pinpoints the second week of January 2025 as the beginning of a significant “alt season,” implying widespread growth across alternative cryptocurrencies, with XRP leading the charge. $XRP will dominate 2025 That gives everyone a few days left to accumulate #XRP at the cheap price of $2-$2.30 in 2024 Once we get to the second week of January 2025 we will experience the beginning of the biggest alt season anyone has ever seen That’s when we see the next god… — BarriC (@B_arri_C) December 25, 2024 This period is expected to culminate in what the analyst describes as a “god candle” for XRP, signifying a large and rapid price increase, ultimately pushing the asset into double-digit valuations. Anticipated Regulatory and Political Shifts Two major factors have been cited to support this optimistic outlook. The inauguration of a new U.S. administration and the anticipated departure of Gary Gensler from his position as Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The change in political leadership in the United States and a change of leadership at the SEC could potentially usher in a more favorable regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies, including XRP. The context of the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple Labs is crucial here. The outcome of this legal battle has had a direct impact on XRP’s price and market performance. If the change in administration and at the SEC results in clearer regulations or a shift in the regulatory approach towards cryptocurrencies, it could be viewed positively by the market and potentially contribute to a price increase for XRP. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Impact of Whale Accumulation In addition to these factors, recent market activity strengthens the case for a potential price surge. Crypto investor Armando Pantoja recently highlighted substantial whale accumulation of XRP. According to Pantoja, 50 million XRP was acquired by whales in a single weekend. Pantoja’s commentary on this activity, stating that “They move in silence before the storm,” suggests that these large investors are strategically positioning themselves for an anticipated upward price movement. Whale accumulation is often interpreted as a bullish signal, as it demonstrates significant investment and confidence from major market participants. Large-volume purchases can impact the market and can be a sign of increased confidence and market participation. While regulatory developments and whale activity can provide valuable insight, they do not guarantee specific outcomes.

Yet, as the market matures, some prominent DOGE enthusiasts focus on projects with more tangible use cases. One such enthusiast is a prominent Dogecoin millionaire who is now betting big on a new real estate altcoin, PCHAIN , that promises to revolutionize the property investment landscape. This altcoin aims to democratize access to the $600 trillion global real estate market using blockchain technology to tokenize real estate assets. With the Dogecoin price struggling in recent months, top market analysts strongly believe this real estate altcoin could emerge as the next big winner, outpacing DOGE’s gains by Q2 2025. The Dogecoin millionaire’s move has sparked widespread interest in the crypto community, as this real estate altcoin presents a compelling alternative to meme-based investments. The altcoin seeks to bridge the gap between digital assets and tangible wealth creation by focusing on real-world applications. The Dogecoin Millionaire and the Quest for the Next Big Break in the Crypto Market This prominent DOGE millionaire turned a modest $10,000 investment in DOGE into over $2 million during its rally to $0.73 in May 2021. Riding on the enthusiasm of the “Doge Army” and tweets from Tesla CEO Elon Musk, this DOGE millionaire epitomized the kind of success story that draws many to the crypto market. However, since its peak, DOGE has faced challenges. Its price has fluctuated significantly, losing much of its momentum. For the Dogecoin millionaire, DOGE’s declining momentum marked the beginning of a new search for the next big thing break in the crypto market. The DOGE millionaire has identified a real estate altcoin, PCHAIN, with the potential to outpace Dogecoin come Q2 2025. PCHAIN is the utility token of PropiChain, a blockchain-powered real estate platform using cutting-edge technologies to revolutionize the real estate industry. Unlike Dogecoin, whose value is driven primarily by hype and social media momentum, this real estate altcoin is backed by real-world assets and an innovative ecosystem poised to disrupt the $600 trillion global real estate market. With the clock ticking toward 2025, this DOGE millionaire believes this real estate altcoin will live up to its potential and leave Dogecoin in its shadow. The Dogecoin Millionaire’s Reason for Betting Big on the Real Estate Altcoin While explaining the rationale behind his huge investment in the real estate altcoin, PCHAIN, the DOGE millionaire, said, “Dogecoin was a phenomenal ride, but it’s primarily driven by hype and sentiment. I’m now looking for projects with real-world utility and long-term growth potential. PropiChain (PCHAIN) ticks all the boxes.” The millionaire has reportedly allocated about 50% of his portfolio to PCHAIN, which he believes positions him for significant returns by Q2 2025. “Real estate is a multi-trillion-dollar market, and tokenization is the future. I’m confident that PropiChain will outpace DOGE in terms of market cap and adoption by Q2 2025,” he added. According to analysts, PropiChain’s growth potential is significant, given the global real estate market’s size. By tapping into this massive industry, this real estate altcoin has the opportunity to establish itself as a cornerstone of blockchain-based real estate transactions, further reinforcing the DOGE millionaire’s belief in the crypto token. PropiChain Powering the Future of Global Real Estate PropiChain is revolutionizing the global real estate sector with state-of-the-art technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), the Metaverse, blockchain-based tokenization of Real World Assets (RWA), and smart contracts. The platform offers investors round-the-clock personalized support through AI-powered virtual assistants and chatbots, providing step-by-step guidance throughout the investment journey. These innovative tools ensure a seamless and tailored experience designed to meet each investor’s unique needs. PropiChain’s advanced predictive AI capabilities analyze market trends and dynamics to deliver highly precise forecasts. These insights empower investors with actionable data, enabling them to identify and seize emerging opportunities in an ever-changing market. This technological advantage helps users navigate the complexities of the real estate industry with greater confidence. Furthermore, PropiChain integrates the Metaverse to utilize virtual reality and 3D visualization for immersive property exploration. The Metaverse feature allows investors to virtually tour properties anywhere in the world, eliminating the necessity of on-site visits and making global property exploration more accessible. PCHAIN’s blockchain-powered tokenization of real-world assets represents a transformative shift in the real estate industry. By converting physical property assets into digital tokens, the platform facilitates fractional ownership, enabling individuals with small capital to purchase fractions of high-value properties. This inclusive strategy opens doors to premium real estate markets for a broader audience and attracts a more diverse pool of investors. In addition, PropiChain enhances operational efficiency through the use of smart contracts, which automate key processes such as property leasing and lease renewals. These automated solutions reduce reliance on intermediaries, cutting costs and saving time while increasing the transparency and efficiency of real estate transactions. PCHAIN’s innovative approach sets new standards for accessibility, efficiency, and innovation in the real estate sector. Conclusion The Dogecoin millionaire’s bet on PCHAIN for its potential to outpace DOGE in 2025 underscores the prospect and profit potential of PropiChain. The first round of the PCHAIN presale grossed over $1.3 million, while the second round raised over $500,000, a sign of investor confidence in the project’s potential. After this second presale round, the token price will increase from $0.011 to $0.023 for the final presale round. Join the PCHAIN presale now for the massive profit potential and to enjoy early access to the future of the $600 trillion global real estate market. Analysts project your $1000 early investment would yield over $315,000 by Q2 2025. The token is listed on CoinMarketCap , indicating the project is ready to take the crypto market by storm. BlockAudit , a top blockchain security firm, audited the project’s smart contract and found no vulnerability.

Bitcoin's 133% YTD performance and potential for further gains make it a compelling investment, despite its historical volatility and downside risks. The incoming Trump administration's potential National Bitcoin Reserve and favorable regulatory backdrop could serve as significant bullish catalysts in 2025. IBIT offers a convenient way to gain bitcoin exposure with lower transaction costs, and its growing AUM and trading volume reflect strong investor interest. Wall Street’s crystal balls are out in full force. With just a few trading days left in 2024, S&P 500 price forecasts are generally bullish (for the first time in three years) while prognostications for bitcoin are likewise sanguine. According to data gathered by Bitwise, the average 2025 price target for bitcoin is above $170,000. Of course, this is not as pure of a sellside look compared to SPX targets since not all of the big banks produce bitcoin forecasts and there are some small companies with vested interests in bitcoin growth also putting out forecasts. Still, it’s clear that bullishness around bitcoin remains in full force after a 133% year-to-date performance, making bitcoin the top sub-asset class of the year. I produced Seeking Alpha’s first analysis of the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) back in January. It has grown to become the largest spot bitcoin ETF. I was neutral on IBIT back then, but turned bullish in the second quarter – that's when I bought the fund. While others have a much lower bitcoin cost basis, I see upside looking ahead to 2025 after the recent pullback from $108,000. 2025 Bitcoin Price Targets André Dragosch, PhD | Bitcoin & Macro YTD Asset Returns: Bitcoin Leads Goldman Sachs According to the issuer, IBIT seeks to reflect generally the performance of the price of bitcoin. The ETF enables investors to get exposure to bitcoin through the convenience of an exchange-traded product, helping remove the operational, tax, and custody complexities of holding bitcoin directly. IBIT has been the most traded bitcoin exchange-traded product since its launch, providing investors with potentially lower transaction costs. IBIT has grown massively from its January inception. Total assets under management is now $53 billion, with increased volume since the start of the fourth quarter. Its annual expense ratio is low at 0.12%, though BlackRock notes that after the 12-month waiver period that began on January 11, 2024, the Sponsor’s Fee will be 0.25%. Share-price momentum has been very strong this year, though there have been bouts of volatility and drawdowns that shareholders of the ETF needed to stomach. I expect more volatility next year. Of course, IBIT does not pay a dividend , but I recently pointed out that there is a liquid covered-call bitcoin ETF: the YieldMax Bitcoin Option Income Strategy ETF (YBIT) which I had a nearer-term hold rating on back when bitcoin was above $100,000 per token. IBIT is a risky ETF given its historical standard deviation trends, but liquidity is strong . Average daily volume is north of 25 million shares, while its 30-day median bid/ask spread is tight at just two basis points, per iShares. Turning to my opinions on bitcoin and why I’m optimistic about the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency, take a look at the below graph. After gold’s 2024 rally, bitcoin is just 11% of gold’s market cap. I assert that there’s a runway for bitcoin to approach gold in total value. If that were the case, then bitcoin could eventually approach the $1 million mark. That would take years, in my view, but we have seen that bitcoin rallies can be intense. Bitcoin Still A Small Asset Compared to Gold In Gold We Trust Report It’s important to be realistic about returns and volatility, though. While bull runs in bitcoin have resulted in thousands of percentage points of gains, drawdowns have typically been on the order of 70% or more. So, prospective investors must be aware of the significant downside risk that’s possible. Recognize the Risk: Bitcoin Drawdowns Have Been Intense Koyfin Charts A potential bullish catalyst in 2025 is the so-called National Bitcoin Reserve that could be put in place by President-elect Trump. As it stands, there’s an implied 58% chance that it will be created before January 1, 2026. That’s a key variable – if it’s effectively constructed, then there would likely be added demand for bitcoin. High Hopes for a Bitcoin Reserve Kalshi With a favorable regulatory backdrop given the incoming administration and a new SEC chairperson set to take over in January, let’s also analyze historical seasonal trends. January has typically been a solid month for the token. The average gain since 2011 has been 12% with a median first-month return of 5%. Fifty-seven percent of Januarys have been up. For Q1 as a whole, it’s the only quarter with positive mean returns for each of the three months. So, seasonality is generally bullish right now. Bitcoin: Bullish Q1 Seasonal Trends Barchart The Technical Take With optimism on the sellside, a still-modest value compared to gold, some bullish political catalysts in the new year, and sanguine seasonals, the technical situation is decent. Notice in the chart below that bitcoin has pulled back from its all-time high above $108,000. The rally to triple digits came on weaker RSI momentum, which was a bearish harbinger. For now, I see support in the low $90,000s and just above $85,000. If it drops below those levels, then a retest of the March 2024 highs near $74,000 could be in play. But take a look at the long-term 200-day moving average – its slope is positive, which shows that the bulls control the primary trend, Bitcoin turned extended versus the 200dma earlier this month, so I see the current pullback as healthy. Moreover, the RSI momentum gauge has not turned oversold, which is another sign that the bears have not gained a whole lot of traction. On the upside, if we take the $55,000 range from late 2021 through earlier this year, and add that on top of the $74,000 breakout point, then we arrive at a ballpark target of near $129,000. Bitcoin: Bullish Long-Term Breakout Targets $120-$130k Stockcharts.com The Bottom Line I have a buy rating on IBIT. I own the fund, and I see further upside in 2025. I encourage fellow investors and prospective investors to recognize that IBIT and bitcoin will likely be highly volatile in the next 12 months as macro news, namely concerning developments with the Trump administration, could be up and down. But with some upside catalysts next year and positive seasonals and technicals, the bullish factors outweigh the bearish risks.",BTC-USD|IBIT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-12-28 06:03:00
38214731,https://coinpedia.org/?p=399138,1735365851,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,Bitcoin Weekly Trade Analysis: Is BTC Price Set for a 20% Drop Ahead of Yearly Close?,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-weekly-trade-analysis-is-btc-price-set-for-a-20-drop-ahead-of-yearly-close/,"The post Bitcoin Weekly Trade Analysis: Is BTC Price Set for a 20% Drop Ahead of Yearly Close? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Bitcoin bulls have switched to the passive mode as they cannot exert enough pressure even in times of a drop in selling volume. This indicates a lack of interest among the market participants, as bears also remain inactive. In such a scenario, an extended pullback usually attracts buying volume and as a result, the last week of the year may attract another 10% to 12% loss, pushing the token under the bearish influence. Bitcoin Faces Bearish Pressure: Key Support Levels to Watch for Year-End The BTC trading volume has surged to some extent compared to the past couple of days, which suggests the volatility could pick up during the weekend. The star token continued to break the supports after failing to secure levels above the resistance, weakening the bulls to some extent. In such a case, the possibility of recovery could be only if the token manages to trade above the pivotal support of around $92,000, which may lay the foundation for the trade in 2025. The BTC price displays some possibility of a bullish rebound as it heads towards the lower support of the falling wedge. The two levels to watch at the moment are $95,767 and $93,211, which are the 50-day SMA & EMA, respectively, acting as interim resistance and support. Breaking any of these levels may have a huge impact on the yearly close, as a rise above the resistance could initiate an early breakout above the falling wedge. Besides, a drop below the support could drag the levels close to the support at $92,109 and collide with the descending trend line as well. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Prediction For December 28 , The RSI is decremental, which indicates the trend could remain under bearish influence, activating the lower targets. Therefore, if the Bitcoin price fails to initiate a recovery to $100K during the weekend, a bearish signal could be confirmed with the support lying between $71,000 and $81,000 while long-term support being around $65,000. Hence, these targets could be activated only if the token closes the weekly trade below the pivotal range of around $92,200, delaying a new ATH for several weeks. BTC Price Action Therefore, considering the current price action, it appears that the range between $80,000 and $85,000 could be a good buyback range, which could offer a good long-term opportunity for the Bitcoin (BTC) price rally. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The filing includes products with 1x, 2x leveraged, and -1x inverse exposure to Solana futures. Thus, it will allow traders to benefit from both – upward and downward SOL price movements. Volatility Shares Futures Solana ETF Come With Leverage Options Volatility Shares filed a futures Solana ETF with the SEC offering leveraged options allowing traders to bet on swing movements for SOL price in either direction. Basically, this futures ETF will allow investors exposure to Solana’s performance through futures contracts. The fund focuses on futures contracts traded exclusively on Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) registered exchanges. The ETF will mirror 100% of SOL returns by primarily investing in near-term and next-term Solana futures contracts. Moreover, to support this investment, the fund maintains collateral in the form of cash, cash equivalents, and high-quality securities. Thus, the futures ETF will provide investors with a structured approach and a regulated way to gain exposure to SOL price movements. It will also maintain appropriate collateral to back its future position. This is not the first time Volatility Shares is planning to launch a future crypto ETF. Previously, the firm played a significant role in pushing forward the Ether futures ETFs. Clearing Path for Spot SOL ETF? Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst, has weighed in on the recent filing for Solana (SOL) futures-based ETFs by Volatility Shares, calling it a “wild” move. Balchunas pointed out the unusual timing, as Solana futures are not yet live, and noted the inclusion of a leveraged 2x product as particularly bold. “This is hardcore,” Balchunas remarked. Balchunas further stated that the ETF filing marks the imminent launch of Solana futures and that this development could improve the odds of spot Solana ETF approval in the future. However, earlier this month, Balchunas had predicted that Litecoin and HBAR ETFs would get approval even before Solana ETFs hit the market. As of press time, the Solana price is trading down 2.87% at $184. Since mid-November, SOL has been moving sideways with other players like BNB Coin and XRP overtaking it in the crypto ranks. Market analysts predict a Solana price surge to $1,000 in the case if the US SEC gives a green light for spot ETF.

It seems every week brings a new sensation, with clever branding, fun communities, and impressive use cases catching everyone’s eye. Despite a turbulent crypto market, these meme coins have held their ground, proving that there’s more to them than just laughs. This week, the spotlight is on BTFD Coin (BTFD), Fantom, Cronos CRO, and Stellar. Let’s dive into what makes these coins worth your attention and why they’re the top new meme coins to join this week. 1. BTFD Coin (BTFD) BTFD Coin is rapidly making a name for itself in the crowded meme coin market. Currently in its 13th presale stage, BTFD Coin has impressively raised over $4.6 million and gained the support of more than 6,900 holders—affectionately known as Bulls. The current price stands at $0.000142, showcasing a remarkable return on investment (ROI) of 3,450%since its initial price of $0.000004. The presale continues to gain momentum, having surpassed $1 million in under 10 days and $2.5 million in just 14 days since its launch, with over 60 billion $BTFD coins sold to date. As this meme coin gains traction, there’s an exciting opportunity for investors, especially with the special offer to use the BIG50 code to unlock extra coins. BTFD Coin stands out by blending fun with real utility, making it a potentially rewarding investment in the cryptocurrency landscape. Don’t miss out on becoming part of this vibrant community! The charm of BTFD Coin isn’t just in the numbers, though. It’s got a fully-fledged Play 2 Earn (P2E) game, which launched in beta during Stage 10. While the beta doesn’t offer rewards just yet, the gameplay is already turning heads. Add to that a generous staking programme with a 90% annual percentage yield (APY) and a referral programme that gives users a chance to earn even more, and you’ve got a recipe for success. Another highlight? The Bulls Squad. This is an exclusive community of BTFD enthusiasts who get early access to updates, premium perks, and behind-the-scenes news. It’s all about building a tight-knit group of believers who see the massive potential in this coin. Why did this coin make it to this list? Simple.

Fantom Next up is Fantom, a name that’s already well-known in the crypto world but continues to innovate and expand its appeal. Fantom stands out because of its incredibly fast and scalable blockchain platform, which is perfect for decentralised finance (DeFi) applications. While it’s not strictly a meme coin, its growing community and creative branding give it that meme-worthy vibe, making it a worthy contender in this list of top new meme coins to join this week. Fantom’s edge lies in its Lachesis consensus mechanism, which ensures near-instant transactions and low fees. It’s the kind of tech that makes you wonder, “Why isn’t everyone using this?” The project’s focus on sustainability is also a big plus, particularly in today’s environmentally-conscious world. And if you’re into DeFi, you’ll love how Fantom integrates with various protocols to offer staking, lending, and yield farming opportunities. Another reason Fantom’s got everyone’s attention? Its partnerships. Fantom has been making waves with collaborations that boost its ecosystem’s utility and user base. It’s the kind of coin that’s constantly innovating, which is exactly what you want in your portfolio. Why did this coin make it to this list? Fantom’s tech is ahead of the curve, its branding is engaging, and its potential for growth is undeniable. While it’s not a traditional meme coin, its rising popularity and fun-loving community earn it a spot here. Jump in before it skyrockets further. 3. Cronos (CRO) Cronos CRO is the native token of the Cronos blockchain, which powers the Crypto.com ecosystem. With its sleek branding and growing adoption, it’s no wonder Cronos has made waves recently. And while it may not scream “meme coin” at first glance, its community’s enthusiasm and dedication give it that playful edge we’re celebrating this week. Cronos’ charm lies in its focus on interoperability and decentralised applications (dApps). The blockchain’s compatibility with Ethereum and Cosmos networks allows it to support a wide range of assets and dApps. That means more opportunities for developers and users alike. And let’s not forget the massive backing from Crypto.com, which gives Cronos a level of credibility and reach that most meme coins can only dream of. But there’s more. Cronos has been making strides in the NFT space, attracting creators and collectors with its user-friendly tools and low fees. It’s also gaining traction in DeFi, with staking and yield farming options that appeal to both beginners and seasoned investors. Why did this coin make it to this list? Cronos CRO combines serious utility with a community-driven approach that makes it feel like a meme coin—but with real substance. It’s a versatile asset with the potential to thrive in various sectors of the crypto market. Don’t miss your chance to be part of its journey. 4. Stellar Stellar has been quietly making waves in the crypto scene for years, but its recent developments have given it a fresh buzz. Known for its focus on financial inclusion, Stellar’s blockchain aims to make cross-border payments faster, cheaper, and more accessible. It’s a noble mission that’s resonated with a growing number of users and investors. What makes Stellar stand out is its partnership with major financial institutions and its integration with traditional banking systems.

Wanting to be part of the next big move in the crypto market , Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders are now gravitating towards a new player in the PayFi sector— Remittix (RTX) . Financial experts believe Remittix will outperform XLM’s recent meteoric rise as it gains more ground in the $190 trillion payment market. With RTX set to be the next 50x altcoin , it looks to thoroughly outperform SHIB which could increase by more than 240%. Stellar (XLM) Prepares for New Pump After Cooling Off In November, Stellar (XLM) was one of the best altcoins , skyrocketing by more than 600%. CoinMarketCap’s data shows that the Stellar coin increased from $0.09200 to trade as high as $0.5700. However, XLM has cooled off, dropping back to the $0.380 range. Despite the recent Stellar price action pointing towards bear action, Javon Marks, a top analyst and strategist has said that everything has led to a possible continuation. Marks also confirmed that Stellar (XLM) has formed yet another bullish pattern. According to his analysis, the Stellar crypto will rise to $ $0.681 first. If XLM can hold above this level, it will open up the altcoin price for a bigger increase in the coming weeks. The final target set by Marks for Stellar (XLM) is at $1.2, representing an increase of more than 220% from its current range. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Confirms Bullish Continuation Set for 240% As a result of the recent market correction, $SHIB tumbled from $0.00003400 to retest the support level at $0.00001800. However, the memecoin has bounced off this strong support to reclaim $0.00002300, per CoinMarketCap . This recent Shiba Inu price action has been confirmed to be the beginning of a bullish continuation by Javon Marks. TheMoonCarl has confirmed this, saying that the Shiba Inu coin is ranging within an ascending triangle on the 1W chart. According to his analysis, the conservative target for Shiba Inu (SHIB) in this bull cycle is around $0.000056. Marks is even more bullish, saying that the Shiba Inu token could well trade as high as $0.000081 in this cycle, a 240% increase from its current range. Why SHIB Investors Are Migrating To Remittix (RTX) While the memecoin could record substantial gains in 2025, it doesn’t compare to Remittix (RTX) , the next 50x altcoin, according to financial experts. The forecasts for RTX, a coin priced at $0.0163, are bullish because of its revolutionary cross-border payment solution. International money transfers are known for being slow, expensive, inefficient, and for most people in the world, unavailable. This issue is taken care of by Remittix which lets anyone send 30+ fiat currencies to any bank account from their cryptocurrency wallets. Remittix allows users to receive 50+ top crypto coins and convert them without any FX fees. It is also faster, cheaper, more reliable, and available to anyone from anywhere on earth. It does this by using Unified Compliance frameworks, advancing the right partnership with global corporations, and tokenizing fiat currencies. Remittix is not just for retail crypto users. Its use case naturally catches the eye of institutional investors who can quickly spur crypto adoption, and Remittix starts climbing up the crypto ladder. The DeFi project has already raised over $650K in its first presale week, highlighting how much interest there is from investors. Can Remittix Outperform Top Altcoins; Stellar and Shiba Inu? Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders pivoting towards this promising new PayFi project Remittix (RTX) underscores the allure of the new altcoin . Set in a $190 trillion market, RTX looks to score bigger gains than Stellar, with a potential rise of 50x in this bull cycle.

33767162,[object Object],1735367432,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Terra (LUNA) Founder Do Kwon Set For US Extradition: Montenegro Minister Signs Order,https://bitcoinist.com/do-kwon-us-extradition/,"In a decision that concludes a series of prolonged legal proceedings, Montenegro’s Minister of Justice, Bojan Božović, has signed an order for the extradition of Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon to the United States. The announcement was confirmed to the Montenegrin daily newspaper Vijesti on Friday, marking the end of months of legal wrangling that pitted the United States against the Republic of Korea in a dual effort to bring the controversial entrepreneur to trial. Do Kwon Will Be Extradited To The US The Supreme Court of Montenegro had already determined that all legal prerequisites for Do Kwon’s extradition were met upon receiving separate requests from both the Republic of Korea and the United States. Their ruling permitted Minister Božović to review the facts and decide which jurisdiction would take priority. “In light of the Supreme Court’s ruling, the Department of Justice has considered all the facts and circumstances and assessed criteria such as the gravity of the crimes, the place of commission, the order in which the request was submitted, the nationality of the requested person, the possibility of further extradition to another country, as well as other circumstances,” said the Department of Justice in a statement provided to Vijesti. The statement continued: “Given the above, it was concluded that most of the criteria provided for by law support the extradition request of the competent authorities of the United States of America, and the Minister of Justice has issued a decision allowing the extradition of Kwon Do Hyeong to the United States of America, while at the same time refusing extradition to the Republic of Korea.” Do Kwon attracted scrutiny from both US and South Korean authorities for his alleged role in one of the most significant collapses in crypto history. In May 2022, the values of TerraUSD and Luna—two tokens created by Kwon—imploded. This event wiped out approximately $40 billion from the broader crypto market, triggering a cascade of bankruptcies among other digital asset firms. Investigators contend that Do Kwon misled investors and further suspect he concealed sizable wealth linked to the TerraUSD/Luna crash. The crypto entrepreneur and the former finance officer of Do Kwon’s company Terraform Labs, Han Chang-joon, were arrested at Podgorica airport on March 23 of last year after authorities determined they were traveling with forged passports en route to Dubai. Do Kwon subsequently received a four-month prison sentence in Montenegro—a development that spurred both US and South Korean officials to step up extradition requests. Following his release from Spuž Prison on March 23, Montenegrin authorities transferred Do Kwon to an immigration inspector. After a five-hour interrogation, he was escorted to the Immigration Center, where he remains pending final arrangements for his extradition. At press time, Terra Luna Classic (LUNC) traded at $0.00011565.",Crypto News|Do Kwon|Do Kwon Extradition|Do Kwon news|LUNC price|Terra Do Kwon|terra luna,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|SEI|JUP|BSV|WLD|APE|HNT|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2024-12-28 06:30:32

As a new project, it brings massive promise for the 2025 bull run. That’s because DTX Exchange brings great perks and features for traders. They can use this new crypto trading platform to make higher profits while trading and improve themselves. The best part is that the DTX token also promises life-changing gains for investors. Namely, it’s set to surge by 100x by Q1 of 2025, fueled by the bull run and massive demand! DTX Exchange: The Future of Trading Starts Here DTX Exchange is a cutting-edge new trading platform. As such, it brings great features for traders, allowing them to finally have a better trading experience. One such feature is its easy-to-use platform. Namely, the DTX Exchange interface is suitable for both new and seasoned traders. It allows them to trade many different assets from one dashboard. This will help them a lot, as they won’t have to switch between multiple platforms to trade. Furthermore, DTX Exchange makes asset management much easier. It does this through its Phoenix Wallet. The Phoenix Wallet is a great new wallet that supports 10,000+ assets. So, it lets you manage all your investments in one safe place. This will reduce the time it takes for you to keep all your investments in check. So you’ll get more time to focus on your trading and strategy. DTX Exchange will also help you boost your profits. That’s because it offers a massive 1,000x leverage to traders. Such an offer can’t be found anywhere else right now, which is yet another feature that will attract many traders as the bull run heats up. With this kind of leverage, you can turn even a small trade into huge profits, making life-changing money with just a few trades. Also, you won’t have to make multiple trades every day to hit your goals anymore! In addition, DTX Exchange offers one of the best features you can have during a bull run—speed! Namely, by using the VulcanX blockchain, DTX Exchange offers a massive 100,000 TPS. This is an unparalleled speed by all accounts, trumping Solana’s 600 TPS significantly! A Fair Investment Opportunity for Everyone: Only With DTX Exchange DTX Exchange also brings some features that are extremely rare in today’s market. One of them is an incredibly fair launch system. Usually, new projects are supported by large investors like whales and VCs. In these cases, the large investors get in before everyone else. This gives them the power to manipulate the token price. Also, they will make much larger profits than others because they’ve entered much earlier. So, they can nuke the chart and take their profits out of the blue, leaving everyone else with nothing. This is why many see new projects as very risky. However, DTX Exchange is here to change all of that. Firstly, it isn’t backed by any large investors. Instead, currently, over 300,000 individual wallets are supporting DTX. And this number is growing with every new day. Also, DTX is currently in its public presale, giving everyone an equal opportunity to get in. So, there are no whales or VCs that can ruin DTX’s price. This is extremely rare for a new project, which is one of the many reasons why so many investors are scrambling to get in! Furthermore, DTX Exchange has an incremental cliff price system. This makes sure that the DTX price increases steadily as it starts and continues trading on exchanges. So, no investors will be left with their accounts drained, and everyone can profit massively off of DTX Exchange! Start the Bull Run With a Bang: Join the DTX Public Presale Now! The bull run is set to be extremely kind to DTX. Namely, experts see this promising token as the leader of the bull run, which is why they’re so confident in it. Also, DTX Exchange’s popularity will be fueled by the great perks it offers to traders. All of these combined can take DTX’s price to massive highs very soon! Right now, DTX is in Stage 7 of its public presale, as Stage 6 got sold out in record time. At this stage, you can purchase your DTX tokens at $0.14, but you’ll have to hurry. Stage 7 will end very soon, and Stage 8 will take its place with DTX selling for $0.14. DTX’s price will continue to rise during the presale, launching at $0.20 in the end. Once this happens, experts say DTX’s price rally will begin . They foresee DTX’s price rising by 100x in just a few months after the launch, bringing life-changing gains to holders as it does!

His commentary highlights significant price levels that could dictate the asset’s future movement, framing them as pivotal for understanding potential bullish or bearish trends. #XRP – Noise Until One of These Happens Key Levels to Watch: 1⃣ $2.00 – A confirmed break here, and we’ll be heading toward the lower targets. 2⃣ $2.65 – Break this level, and fireworks will ignite! The upper targets will be in play! #XRPFamily STAY STEADY AND… pic.twitter.com/sDPUwY3fyK — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 26, 2024 Key Insights from Egrag Crypto’s Analysis Egrag Crypto identified two critical levels to monitor in XRP’s price action: $2.00 Level: According to Egrag Crypto, a confirmed breakdown of the $2.00 price point could signal bearish momentum, potentially driving XRP toward lower price zones. This threshold is seen as a crucial support level, and failure to maintain it could indicate increased selling pressure. $2.65 Level: On the flip side, a successful breakout above $2.65 is described as a bullish trigger that could pave the way for higher price targets. Egrag Crypto suggests this movement could ignite substantial upward momentum, implying the possibility of XRP reaching or exceeding the $2.91, $3.55, or $3.77 levels marked on the chart. XRP Price Analysis The accompanying chart visually depicts XRP’s price consolidating within a triangular formation, bounded by support at $2.00 and resistance near $2.65. This pattern often represents a period of indecision, where price compresses before a significant breakout or breakdown. The yellow box around the triangle highlights the broader consolidation range, while annotated price levels provide further clarity on possible scenarios. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP Community Reacts The analysis sparked discussions among the XRP community. An X user, Razor, offered a contrasting perspective, asserting that traditional chart patterns may be irrelevant in the current market environment. Razor commented: “Charts mean shit now, crypto has moved into a different space. Price will be determined on utility and the value it brings to the system. I see a lot more stability in the market for utility coins going forward.” This viewpoint highlights an evolving trend in the cryptocurrency space, where utility and fundamental value are increasingly seen as key drivers of long-term price stability, as opposed to speculative trading or purely technical indicators. Final Thoughts Egrag Crypto’s analysis provides a structured framework for understanding XRP’s potential price movement in the near term. It equips traders and investors with actionable insights by identifying critical levels and offering possible scenarios. However, as Razor’s comment suggests, the crypto market is maturing, with utility and adoption playing a larger role in determining long-term value. For now, XRP enthusiasts are advised to monitor the $2.00 and $2.65 levels, as the asset’s price action near these thresholds could provide crucial signals for its next major move.

The major happenings for the current week were the creativity of hackers in hacking and the weak spots still existing in the ecosystem. Below, is a close-up view of the hacker attacks this week. Fraudsters in Pig Butchering Scams Defraud Victims of $3.6 Billion. In 2024, Pig Butchering scams took over $3.6 billion and are one of the most dangerous threats to crypto users. These elaborate schemes establish a foundation of trust, finally leading to the victims being manipulated into investing in fake crypto investment platforms. In total, there were 800,000 fake transactions made to over 150,000 Ethereum wallets. Phishing Ads con NFT users of Pudgy Penguins With a new phishing technique, fraudsters launched Google ads to trick Pudgy Penguins NFT project members into handing over their wallet information to fake sites. The campaign targeted ad networks and weak Web3 front-ends. That is why ad blockers, URL checks, and separation of wallets’ actions in safe zones are advised, according to the experts. Animoca Brands Chairman’s X Account Hacked Hackers managed to breach Yat Siu’s X account to pump up a fictitious “ANIMOCA” token before running off after the fraud was unmasked. Mishap which was worked around the 2FA security shows vulnerability within social media platforms and the need to confirm such announcements before putting resources on any investment offers. Crypto Miner Suffers $1MILLION Theft From Zoom Malware A DeFi miner lost $1 million after a phishing attack that seemed like a fake Zoom app. In addition to directly stealing funds, the malware obtained credentials of wallets and private keys to boost the threat of malware-based schemes. $500,000 Lost Through Fraudulent X Account Phishing Scams Phishing emails which copied official letters were used to con 15 high-profile X accounts, in which attackers stole more than $500,000 . Such scams made people provide their login information and 2FA codes. Security specialists advise to not re-use passwords, use hardware wallets, 2-factor authentication and confirm emails before acting on them. Lazarus Group Allegations Strike at Hyperliquid In the Layer-1 DeFi platform Hyperliquid, $250 million has been net outflow, after which it was accused of being hacked by North Korea’s Lazarus Group . Despite the platform’s denial of this, its token lost 20% of its value leading to discussions about the danger of centralization of validators and poor measures for security. The events of the week show that hackers are becoming more professional and equipped as the cryptocurrency market remains weak. From phishing attacks, and social engineering tactics to malware attacks, it is extremely important to keep an eye out and avoid leaving various assets open-ended. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Winter Pepe (PEPEWINT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEWINT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Winter Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Winter Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Winter Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Winter Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Winter Pepe by entering its contract address – CUreLFB9SJmu6WEpotjmLJgt1khhdpneukDRJsbXFCGM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEWINT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-28 06:55:00

XRP Army Responds",https://timestabloid.com/now-that-rlusd-is-live-what-is-stopping-xrp-getting-to-100-xrp-army-responds/,"A tweet by prominent crypto enthusiast XRP Avengers has sparked a spirited discussion within the cryptocurrency community. The post , which says, “Now that $RLUSD is now live, what’s stopping #XRP price getting to $100?” has generated diverse perspectives from supporters, skeptics, and market analysts. This discourse sheds light on the factors influencing XRP’s price and the challenges it faces in achieving the ambitious target of $100 per token. RLUSD’s Role in the XRP Ecosystem RLUSD, a stablecoin issued on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), has recently gone live, signifying another milestone in XRPL’s ongoing evolution. Stablecoins like RLUSD are designed to provide liquidity, reduce volatility, and promote seamless cross-border transactions. Their integration into the XRP ecosystem strengthens its utility and appeal to financial institutions, retail users, and developers. While this is a significant development, it alone may not be sufficient to drive XRP’s price to the speculative $100 level. XRP Army’s Perspectives on the $100 Price Target George Vedelek, a commenter in the thread, attributed XRP’s potential price surge to future regulatory clarity. He speculated that a political shift, such as former President Donald Trump returning to office, could lead to executive orders fostering a favorable environment for cryptocurrency growth. While political and regulatory developments often impact market sentiment, the direct correlation between a single political event and XRP reaching $100 remains speculative. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Another user, Andor Byrd, provided a more technical viewpoint, emphasizing the importance of network volume. He pointed out that XRP’s intended use case—facilitating high-volume transactions on a global scale—is essential for significant price appreciation. Byrd acknowledged the possibility of a rapid increase in transaction volume but expressed skepticism about the timeline, stating, “Sure, but when?” Similarly, TFC Guy outlined key factors needed to achieve a $100 price point: massive adoption, regulatory clarity, market optimism, and favorable supply-demand dynamics. He noted that while RLUSD adds utility to the XRPL ecosystem , broader adoption and systemic growth are critical for XRP’s long-term price trajectory. The community’s reactions to XRP Avengers’ tweet illustrate the diverse opinions surrounding XRP’s potential. While some view regulatory clarity as a catalyst, others emphasize the importance of network activity and real-world use cases. While RLUSD’s launch is a notable development, the $100 price target for XRP remains speculative and dependent on multiple variables.

Who can forget the explosion of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? Recently, however, things have been dicey. Popcat, one of the hottest meme coins on the Solana blockchain, saw its price nosedive over 50% in a month. Similarly, Snek, inspired by the classic Nokia snake game, has had its moments of glory but remains a niche player. Amid this chaos, a new star has emerged— BTFD Coin . Its presale has shattered records, pulling in over $4.6 million in just weeks and reigniting excitement in the crypto world. Let’s dive in and see why these three coins are some of the best crypto to invest in 2024. Meme coins have captivated the world for years. What started as jokes turned into full-blown financial movements. Investors and Gen Z traders alike can’t resist the charm of coins like Popcat, which bank on cultural quirks and nostalgia. But meme coins are no longer just about the memes. They integrate games, staking rewards, and community power to create lasting value. Enter BTFD Coin—a game-changer poised to set the meme coin market on fire with its play-to-earn (P2E) game , referral program, and staking rewards. This isn’t just another meme coin; it’s a powerhouse backed by a strong community and tangible benefits. Ready to explore the best crypto to invest in? Here’s a deep dive into BTFD Coin, Popcat, and Snek. BTFD Coin: Turning Dips Into Dollars BTFD Coin’s story is the kind of underdog success that crypto enthusiasts dream about. Starting at just $0.000004 per coin, the token has skyrocketed to a current Stage 13 price of $0.000142. That’s an 837.5% ROI for early investors ! With over $4.6 million raised and more than 60 billion coins sold, BTFD has proven it’s not here to play—it’s here to win. Let’s talk strategy. Imagine investing $20,000 at the Stage 7 price of $0.000064. By the end of the presale, when the coin lists at $0.0006, your $20,000 could balloon to over $187,500. That’s life-changing money, and it’s why analysts can’t stop buzzing about BTFD Coin’s potential. So, what makes BTFD Coin a standout? First, there’s its killer P2E game, where players can earn while having fun. Then there’s the referral program—bring in friends, and you’re rewarded in BTFD. And let’s not forget the staking rewards, which encourage long-term holding and boost the coin’s stability. Ready to grab your share? Head to the presale page at btfd.io . Connect your wallet, enter the bonus code BIG50 for extra coins, and secure your spot before the presale ends. Popcat: The Meme That Went Too Far? Popcat is the quintessential meme coin. Born on the Solana blockchain, it gained massive popularity with its quirky “pop-to-click” feature. At its peak, it crossed the $2 mark. But by December 2024, it had plummeted to $0.7. So, is Popcat still one of the best crypto to invest in? The answer—maybe. Popcat’s main selling point is its charm. Its interactive website, featuring a cartoon cat that “pops” when clicked, is undeniably fun. But there’s a catch: no pop-to-earn mechanism. Without real utility, the coin’s value hinges on market trends and meme culture. Analysts predict that if Bitcoin rallies in 2025, Popcat could climb back to $3 or $4. Otherwise, it may continue its rollercoaster ride, potentially sinking to $0.5 by 2030. Popcat’s community is its saving grace. Meme coins live and die by their fanbase, and Popcat’s supporters are nothing if not loyal. However, without updates or added functionality, it’s hard to see how it competes with dynamic projects like BTFD Coin. Snek: Nostalgia Meets Blockchain Snek taps into a different kind of nostalgia. Inspired by the classic Nokia snake game, this play-to-earn token combines gaming and crypto in a simple and charming way. At its recent peak price of $0.0094, Snek made waves among gamers and blockchain enthusiasts. But here’s the kicker: Snek’s appeal might also be its Achilles’ heel. Its gaming-centric approach is a hit among niche audiences, but it lacks the broader appeal needed for explosive growth. Unlike BTFD Coin, which offers multiple incentives like staking and referral bonuses, Snek’s success largely depends on its nostalgic gameplay. That said, Snek’s simplicity has its own magic. It’s easy to pick up, fun to play, and taps into a market of casual gamers. If you’re looking for a bit offbeat project but still among the best crypto to invest in, Snek deserves a spot on your radar. How to Join the BTFD Coin Presale Want to get in on the action? Here’s how to buy BTFD Coin and unlock bonus coins using the BIG50 code. Go to the Presale Page . Click “Connect Wallet” and select your wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet). Locate the Bonus Code field, enter BIG50, and click “Apply.” Input the amount of BTFD you want to buy and review the discounted price. Click “Buy Now” and confirm the transaction in your wallet. Easy, right? Don’t wait too long—the presale is in its 13th stage, and prices will only go up. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin is a no-brainer for anyone looking for the best crypto to invest in right now. With its explosive presale performance, innovative P2E game, and robust community, it’s set to redefine what meme coins can achieve. Popcat and Snek have their merits, but they’re no match for the momentum behind BTFD Coin. Don’t miss out. Join the BTFD Coin presale today and turn market dips into massive gains. Visit btfd.io now, use the BIG50 code, and get ready to ride the wave to crypto success!

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/shiba-inu-lead-dev-says-its-time-to-start-talking-about-this-token-heres-why/,"Shytoshi Kusama, the anonymous lead developer of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, recently announced the rollout of “SHIB: The Metaverse” and introduced the forthcoming TREAT token. This development signifies a pivotal advancement in the Shiba Inu project’s evolution, underscoring its commitment to innovation and expansion within the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. So now that the Metaverse is rolling out well and those who said it wasn't coming have been once again it's time to start talking about $TREAT , the future of our state and what we've been up to the last few years to ensure we are ahead of the pack. Stay tuned… — Shytoshi Kusama (@ShytoshiKusama) December 27, 2024 SHIB: The Metaverse “SHIB: The Metaverse” represents a significant leap for the Shiba Inu ecosystem. It offers users an immersive virtual environment that integrates blockchain technology with interactive experiences. This platform enables users to purchase digital land, create avatars, and host events, fostering a dynamic virtual community. The metaverse comprises over 100,000 plots of land, categorized into four tiers, with initial prices ranging from 0.2 ETH to 1 ETH. This initiative reflects Shiba Inu’s transition from a meme coin to a utility-driven digital asset, aiming to revolutionize virtual engagement and digital ownership. Introduction of the TREAT Token Building upon the momentum of the metaverse launch, Kusama has introduced the TREAT token, poised to become a central component of the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Although details regarding TREAT’s functionalities are forthcoming, it is anticipated to serve multiple roles, including governance, rewards, and enhancing user engagement within the ecosystem. Kusama has indicated that TREAT will help reward systems and DeFi integrations, facilitating innovative partnerships, and empowering users by granting them a voice in decision-making processes through voting mechanisms. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Strategic Collaborations and Technological Integration In a strategic move to expand the ecosystem’s real-world impact, Kusama has unveiled TREAT’s first use case through a collaboration with Oogwai , a project dedicated to longevity research. This partnership focuses on utilizing Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology. It allows computations on encrypted data without decryption, ensuring data privacy and security. TREAT is expected to facilitate efficient data processing within this framework, highlighting Shiba Inu’s commitment to leveraging advanced technologies for societal benefit. XRP Future Prospects The introduction of TREAT and the successful deployment of “SHIB: The Metaverse” underscore the Shiba Inu development team’s dedication to staying ahead in the rapidly evolving blockchain landscape. These initiatives enhance user experience, foster community engagement, and expand the ecosystem’s utility beyond its origins. As the Shiba Inu project continues to innovate, it aims to solidify its position within the DeFi space, offering users a comprehensive and multifaceted platform for digital interaction and financial participation.

However, trading activity dipped slightly, with intraday trade volume falling by 1.66% to $124.18 billion . Despite this, market sentiment remains neutral, as indicated by the Fear & Greed Index at 51. Bitcoin Struggles Below $95k Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, experienced a 2.11% drop in the last 24 hours, settling at $94,290. Interestingly, trading volumes for Bitcoin rose by 5.19% to $48.39 billion, showing increased trading activity during the price drop. Reports from Farside revealed that Bitcoin ETFs saw significant outflows of $287 million on Friday. Fidelity led the outflows with $208 million, followed by Ark & 21Shares at $112 million, and Bitwise Bitcoin ETF with $36 million. Altcoins Show Mixed Results Altcoins had a mixed day, with Ethereum holding steady at $3,335 after a slight dip, with a market cap is $401 billion. While Ethereum ETFs faced $47.7 million in inflow, Fidelity and BlackRock reported inflows of $27 million and $20 million, respectively.

Bitcoin To Drop To $80,000? Seasoned analyst and trader Aksel Kibar took to X to share his thoughts on the recent BTC price action. In his post, the chartered market technician highlighted a potential head and shoulders pattern forming on the daily BTC chart, with risk of the cryptocurrency dropping as low as $80,000. The analyst explained that the pullback could push BTC’s price to the broadening pattern that completed with a breakout above $73,600. However, Kibar emphasized that the head and shoulders pattern must fully materialize for a significant pullback in BTC price to occur. He stated: Seeing it is not enough. It needs to materialize with a breach below the neckline. There are many cases of failed head and shoulders tops especially in steady uptrends well above the year-long average. Other crypto analysts have also shared similar bearish outlooks for Bitcoin’s price. For instance, technical analyst Ali Martinez identified $92,730 as a crucial price level for the top cryptocurrency. According to Martinez, losing this level could push BTC into “free fall territory,” based on UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD). Related Reading: Bitcoin Sell-Off Likely When This Metric Reaches 4%, Analyst Explains For the uninitiated, URPD is a metric that shows the distribution of Bitcoin’s Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) across various price levels, based on when they were last moved. Essentially, it helps identify price zones where significant BTC accumulation or spending occurred, providing insights into investor behavior and market sentiment. In addition, former Wall Street derivatives trader Tone Vays warned that BTC trading below the $95,000 price level would be “very, very bad” for the flagship digital asset. Similarly, renowned trader Peter Brandt recently highlighted the risk of BTC breaking down from a ‘broadening triangle’ formation, potentially falling to the $70,000 level. While several analysts predict a potential price correction, others remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. Thomas Lee of Fundstrat Capital projected that BTC could surge as high as $250,000 by 2025. However, he acknowledged the possibility of a short-term correction to $60,000 early next year before Bitcoin enters a historic bull run. The Long-Term Bullish Case For BTC While BTC may indeed face a looming price correction according to some analysts, the long-term price projections remain overwhelmingly bullish. Crypto asset manager Sygnum posits that BTC may face ‘demand shocks’ due to strong institutional interest in the asset, driving its price significantly higher. Related Reading: Bitcoin May Surge To $200,000 By Mid-2025 Amid ‘Mild’ Price Pullbacks: Report Earlier this month, Ali Martinez highlighted the potential formation of a ‘cup and handle’ pattern on BTC’s chart. If this pattern plays out, it could trigger renewed bullish momentum for the digital asset. At press time, BTC trades at $94,149, down 2.5% in the past 24 hours.

While these rules largely target DeFi trading platforms rather than individual taxpayers, they will impact how DeFi platforms operate and the experience of their customers. Under Section 6045 of the US tax code, brokers are required to collect know-your-customer (KYC) information from customers, calculate gains and losses, and report this data to the IRS via forms like 1099-B. Last year, the IRS expanded these rules to include custodial cryptocurrency brokers like centralized exchanges (CeFi). Now, the IRS has clarified how these rules apply to the DeFi ecosystem. Interface Layer: This layer allows users to interact with DeFi platforms, including screens, buttons, forms, and other visual elements on websites, mobile apps, and browser extensions. Application Layer: This layer facilitates the execution of trades, including verification and recording of transactions on the blockchain. Consensus layer: Responsible for recording financial transactions on the distributed ledger, including transactions made by users trading digital assets using DeFi protocols. Related News: Analysis Company Announced Crypto Money Predictions for 2025: “Bitcoin $150,000, Ethereum $5,500, Dogecoin $1...” The IRS will only treat Interface Layer (front-end commerce services) as “intermediaries” under the new regulations. These platforms, which have the most direct contact with users, will now face stricter reporting requirements. Starting January 1, 2027, DeFi platforms operating as front-end trading services must: Collecting KYC information from customers during onboarding, similar to centralized exchanges. Tracking client transactions and reporting income to both the IRS and clients via Form 1099-DAs. If you are a customer of a front-end DeFi platform, here is what you should expect: KYC Requirements: Similar to the onboarding process for centralized platforms, you will be required to provide your personal information for identification purposes. Tax Reporting: While platforms will report trading income, you will still need to use crypto tax software to track your cost basis and calculate your gains or losses. *This is not investment advice.

ADA is trying to keep momentum, struggling to attain $21 in this cycle. However, a promising rival token valued at just $0.15 is likely to outshine it, maybe crossing the $21 milestone in the first 100 days of 2025. This article examines the present status of Cardano price and the reasons behind why its competitor, Rexas Finance (RXS), could generate significant returns. Cardano Price Struggles in the Market At $0.8777 today, Cardano price has dropped significantly from its early November spike after Donald Trump’s election triumph. ADA broke beyond the $1 barrier, reaching a high of $1.3187 on December 03, 2024 but during the recent bear market, it has suffered a 33.45% drop. This declining trend raises questions about ADA’s ability to keep its current gains, let alone meet its aggressive price forecasts. Cardano’s stagnation in value highlights its shortcomings, as rivals provide more flexible ecosystems and greater growth possibilities. Considering these elements, experts have doubts on Cardano price reaching $21 this cycle. The larger market is uncertain, and the token finds it challenging to inspire fresh investor interest. Cardano (ADA) price chart Rexas Finance (RXS): The $0.15 Cardano (ADA)’s Rival Cardano faces mounting challenges as Rexas Finance (RXS) emerges as a fierce competitor with remarkable growth potential. Currently priced at just $0.15 during its Stage 10 presale, RXS has already demonstrated impressive momentum, achieving a 5x increase since its initial stage. The RWA token project has successfully raised over $30.27 million in its presale, reflecting strong investor confidence and interest. Rexas Finance is transforming the blockchain by closing the real-world and digital economy gap. Its network lets users tokenize actual assets effortlessly, permitting fractional ownership and opening new frontiers for world asset management. With a complete toolkit, including the Rexas Token Builder and the Rexas Launchpad, RXS lets people and companies tokenize assets and quickly generate money. Rexas Finance is leading the way in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, unlike ADA, which has struggled to be widely applicable outside its natural habitat. Its creative strategy makes it a fierce competitor to reach exponential expansion and overcome significant price benchmarks in the following months. Rexas Finance Tokenomics Rexas Finance (RXS) Crossing $21 by Early 2025 According to market analysts, Rexas Finance (RXS) will earn 13,900% profit, driving its price to over $21 in the first 100 days of 2025. This optimism is fueled by its strong ecosystem, Certik audit certification, and unparalleled tokenizing powers. Investors globally have embraced the platform’s goal of democratizing asset ownership. Rexas Finance eliminates obstacles, including complicated legal systems and geographic limitations, by allowing users to tokenize real-world assets such as real estate, goods, and intellectual property. Its presale success and attraction to both retail and institutional investors have come from this practical value. Moreover, Rexas Finance (RXS) keeps developing confidence within the crypto community by stressing security and openness. Certik audit confirms Rexas Finance’s technical integrity and increases investor confidence. With a clear route map and great community support, RXS has positioned itself as a top candidate for exceptional 2025 growth. Rexas Finance also offers a $1M giveaway prize, further encouraging ecosystem involvement. With more than 579,000 entries recorded, the promotion will award 20 winners $50,000 worth of RXS tokens. This deliberate project has improved user involvement and broadened its community base, enabling ongoing expansion. Utilizing the platform’s creative ecosystem and quick presale success, this early-stage cryptocurrency hopes to draw attention as a deserving substitute for Cardano. Final Thoughts: Cardano Price Struggles as Rexas Finance Rises While Cardano price struggles to maintain momentum amidst market uncertainties, Rexas Finance (RXS) stands out as a rising star with extraordinary growth potential. With its innovative approach to real-world asset tokenization, strong presale performance, and robust ecosystem, RXS has positioned itself as a formidable competitor. As Cardano (ADA) faces challenges in achieving its ambitious price targets, Rexas Finance’s promising trajectory and ambitious roadmap make it a compelling investment opportunity, poised to deliver remarkable returns in the coming months and potentially surpass significant milestones like $21 by early 2025.

Dogecoin: The Meme Cryptocurrency with Growing Influence Dogecoin (DOGE) emerged in 2013 as a playful alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies, featuring a Shiba Inu dog from a popular meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin was designed to be abundant, with no maximum supply and 10,000 new coins mined every minute. Initially considered a joke, it gained significant value in 2021, becoming one of the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. This rise was driven by social media influence and interest from figures like Elon Musk. Dogecoin’s potential lies in its active community and the impact of social media on its popularity. Its appeal in the current market cycle depends on these factors and broader trends in the cryptocurrency space. Conclusion With DOGE and XRP showing less short-term potential, attention shifts to Catzilla, the ultimate meme coin hero bringing financial freedom to all. Offering 700% ROI during its presale from $0.0002 to $0.0016 over 14 stages, Catzilla provides governance, loyalty rewards, and staking options.

Recent technical analysis highlights a breach of the upper Bollinger Band at $0.6374, with the 20-day moving average acting as a median point at $0.21. This situation is reminiscent of 2021 when XLM peaked at $0.797 before suffering a sharp 48.73% decline within a week. Over the past three weeks, XLM has already dropped by over 40%, and at the time of writing, it is trading at $0.3541—down 0.4% in the last 24 hours, as reported by CoinMarketCap. Analysts suggest that XLM could face a further 45% drop if bearish market conditions persist. While historical patterns provide some context, external market forces and overall cryptocurrency sentiment remain key factors in determining the token’s future performance. Japanese Government Hesitant on Bitcoin as a Reserve Asset The Japanese government has recently expressed caution regarding Bitcoin’s adoption as a reserve currency. According to Wu Blockchain, citing CoinPost, Satoshi Hamada, a member of Japan’s House of Councillors, urged the government to follow the United States in incorporating Bitcoin into its reserve strategy. Despite these calls, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba stated that Japan lacks sufficient information on the U.S.’s actions concerning Bitcoin reserves. Additionally, crypto assets are not classified as foreign exchange under Japan’s regulatory framework, and concerns about the security and liquidity of such assets have further complicated their consideration as reserves. The government’s stance underscores a cautious approach toward integrating volatile assets into national financial policies. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Shiba Inu (SHIB) Faces Critical Support Level Test Shiba Inu (SHIB) is grappling with significant market challenges, as bearish sentiment weighs heavily on the asset. On-chain data shows that SHIB is trading near $0.00002164, with its key support at the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) under considerable strain. The 200-day EMA is now closely aligned with the asset’s current price, creating an additional layer of vulnerability. A failure to hold these critical support levels could trigger a steep decline, potentially pushing SHIB down to $0.0000204 or lower. Large transaction volumes involving institutional investors have also declined sharply, suggesting reduced confidence in the asset. If key support is lost, panic selling could further amplify losses. However, there remains some potential for recovery if SHIB rebounds from the 200-day EMA and attracts speculative interest. The coming days are expected to be pivotal for XLM, SHIB, and the broader cryptocurrency market, as external factors and investor sentiment continue to shape their trajectories.

With an additional layer of Bitcoin futures integration, the proposed ETFs would track the performance of the S&P 500, Nasdaq-100, and gold. How Will the ProShares Bitcoin-Hedged ETFs Function? As per the SEC filing, these Bitcoin-hedged ETFs will combine long positions in underlying stocks or gold with a short position on the U.S. dollar and a long position in Bitcoin via futures contracts. With this strategy, ProShares seeks to leverage Bitcoin’s potential as an alternative asset while offering exposure to traditional financial markets. Note that the fund doesn’t make any direct investment into Bitcoin. The SEC filing notes that the short U.S. dollar/long Bitcoin strategy is executed by investing in future contracts for Bitcoin. Thus, it provides a currency hedge for the U.S. dollar exposure tied to the S&P 500 stock position. Reset on a monthly basis, this hedge aims to reduce the effects of fluctuations in the U.S. dollar’s value relative to Bitcoin. This move marks another step in Bitcoin’s growing influence over traditional finance (TradFi). Over the years, institutions have been exploring innovative ways to integrate Bitcoin and digital assets into conventional investment methods. Furthermore, industry leaders like Robert Kiyosaki are turning bullish expecting it to hit $350K by the end of 2025. Demand for BTC Bond ETF on the Rise The latest filing from ProShares reflects the growing market confidence towards the flagship crypto. Notably, following the filing of Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Company ETF , REX has proposed a new exchange-traded fund (ETF) aimed at investing in convertible bonds issued by companies that hold Bitcoin in their corporate treasuries. Dubbed the “Bitcoin Corporate Treasury Convertible Bond ETF,” it seeks to provide investors with exposure to firms like MicroStrategy, Marathon Digital, Metaplanet, and others that leverage Bitcoin as a strategic asset. The fund commits to investing at least 80% of its net assets, including any borrowings, in these specialized convertible bonds, noted the filing. The structure offers investors a unique way to gain exposure to companies involved in the bitcoin space while focusing on their convertible bond offerings rather than direct equity or cryptocurrency investments. Inflows into spot BTC ETFs have skyrocketed after Donald Trump’s election victory last month with hopes of rising Bitcoin adoption in the market. The total inflows since inception have skyrocketed to more than $35.6 billion with BlackRock’s IBIT alone seeing over $37 billion in inflows.

Will that finally change for the asset in 2025? Here’s ChatGPT’s answer. Can XRP Break Above $3.4 in 2025? It’s safe to say that the Trump-induced rally after his decisive win in the 2024 US presidential elections benefited some assets more than others. XRP stood quietly below $0.6 but on the hopes that the SEC lawsuit will finally be resolved during a more favorable administration and better regulations, it skyrocketed within several weeks to almost $3. However, its run was halted there and Ripple’s native cross-border token even slipped below $2 on a couple of occasions. It now stands at around $2.15, which is more than 35% away from its January 7, 2018 all-time high of $3.4. With just a few days left in 2024, it seems highly unlikely that this record will fall by January 1. But, what are XRP’s chances for a new all-time high in 2025? Well, ChatGPT’s answer was quite bullish, actually. In the first part, the AI chatbot indicated that numerous analysts and forecasts envision XRP going to $4.5 in H1 of 2025, driven by “factors such as increased adoption and favorable regulatory develpoments.” Furthermore, the AI tool asserted that the asset could shot up to $7 if the aforementioed factors align with better market conditions and investor sentiment. Nevertheless, it also had a second part to its answer, suggesting that “XRP may underperform in 2025 as investors might shift their focus to newer cryptocurrencies, potentially impacting its growth prospects.” And Perplexity Says…? ChatGPT’s rival also outlined XRP’s spectacular price growth at the end of 2024 and highlighted three probable scenarios for the asset for the next year. The conservative one sees XRP stabilizing between its current level and $3. The more optimistic one foresees a price rally to uncharted territory of $4.44 and $5.25. The more outrageous prediction indicates a run toward $8 by the end of 2025. Such a price tag would put XRP’s market capitalization at roughly $500 billion, which would make it the second-largest by that metric if ETH’s stays the same. Perplexity mentioned essentially the same factors that could propel a price rally for XRP, including better regulatory landscape in the US, bullish market sentiment across the entire crytpo fieled, and growing institutional adoption. The last part could be fastlaned if the upcoming SEC administration approves a Ripple ETF , just like it did with BTC and ETH in 2024.

When it goes live, it will become the second memecoin ETP on a regulated stock exchange, following in the footsteps of the Dogecoin ETP. The coin has seen a jump of 400% this year showcasing immense community support to push it to new heights. Many seem to be taking for granted how incredible it is for a #memecoin to have an ETP. There are millions of memecoins, and there are at least 8 memecoins above $1 billion market cap! Of these, only one currently has an ETP on a regulated stock exchange: $DOGE . $FLOKI is next… https://t.co/mPEoIvHrUM — B (Da Viking) (@100bviking) December 27, 2024 Floki’s bullish move is creating a possibility of a memecoin breakout in 2025 as following the lead many others will jump on the ETP mania to leverage the success. Following the news Floki is expected to rise in price and may attract big institutional support. What is the Proposal? As per the proposal, it will allocate a portion of the 16.3 billion tokens in the community’s buyback wallet to provide liquidity for the ETP, while the remaining tokens will be burned. As a result, the token’s price surged 5%, reaching $0.0001797, with trading volume jumping by 58% in just 24 hours. The community-driven projects are seen as a hot choice for crypto investors as many meme coins are supported by political leaders and celebrities. Interest Market is Heating Up Hence, market analysts are bullish about Floki’s potential. With futures open interest (OI) increasing by 10% and derivative volumes up by 74%, there’s a noticeable surge in market interest. Some analysts predict that Floki could rally by over 50%, possibly reaching $0.00055, and even target $0.00080. This growing attention from both traders and analysts highlights Floki’s bullish outlook, especially as the ETP launch could significantly boost its market visibility and investor interest. What Next? Floki Inu is in a recovery phase where its price is holding steady but at the same time it is getting ready for a potential jump. Right now, it’s stuck below a key price level of $0.0002761. If it manages to break through this level, it could soar, with some analysts predicting it could reach as high as $0.0005467, which would be a huge 200% increase from where it is now. The excitement around Floki comes from its strong community, growing partnerships, and increasing attention in the market. If the token can break out soon, it might offer a big opportunity for investors willing to take on some risk. Though the excitement is high, it is better to analyze the market first before investing in the hyped projects as many analysts warn that such projects can be fatal once the craze on social media fades.

In a new interview with Anna Tutova, the CEO of Coinstelegram, Hayes says Bitcoin could hit seven figures in about a year or so due to a massive expansion of monetary supply from governments. “I believe we can get to $1 million end of the cycle – $1 million… b ecause the amount of money that’s going to be printed is going to be absolutely insane as every government around the world does the same thing, which is print money to make my people feel happy because the global growth is slowing… I think that we’re in a transition period of a global financial system. We’re going to change it. The elites will resist the change, which means they’re going to print a lot of money and more money that’s ever been printed because they don’t want the post-World War II US hegemony to change.” Bitcoin is trading for $94,244 at time of writing, down 1.8% in the last 24 hours. Asked how long the current bull market may last, Hayes says, “ Maybe 2026, 2027 is my estimate, but who knows.” He also says that while some altcoins have plummeted, the overall crypto market cap is up compared to more than a year ago, indicating the upward trend remains intact. “The aggregate value of all of crypto has still increased over the last 12 to 18 months, so I believe we’re still in a bull market.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Although it had its share of struggles, the Pepe coin price performance has equipped crypto investors with heavy returns. One such investor made $11.7M recently, showcasing the token’s high profit potential. Let’s discuss what’s happening. Crypto Investor Made $11.7M With PEPE Token’s Downtrend According to Lookonchain , a popular analytics page on X, a crypto investor made incredibly heavy returns in Pepe Coin. Interestingly, all this happened when the PEPE token was in a dip, shocking every reader. The crypto user has been holding millions of this frog-themed coin and dumped them when the PEPE price began to decline after it hit the ATH of $0.00002825 around three weeks ago. With that, the crypto investor made $11.7M in profits, which could have been higher if he had not missed the ATH. Regardless, Pepe Coin’s price performance has helped investors make heavy returns. Interestingly, he is still busy accumulating more PEPE. In the last week alone, he has spent $24.5M to buy 1.42T PEPE, continuing his profit-making journey with this frog-theme meme coin. Interestingly, this is not the first person who has made heavy returns with PEPE. Another PEPE trader made millions after turning $70 into $7M over the PEPE’s impressive price performance. PEPE Token’s Bullish Returns, Price Surged 4% Today Pepe Coin has become one of the most profitable meme coins ever since the beginning of the year due to its constant surges. With that, he achieved multiple all-time highs within the year, and the most recent was just 19 days ago. However, a downtrend began right after that, pushing the PEPE price 35% away, currently trading at $0.00001829 after a 4% surge in the last 24 hours. Interestingly, this happened with the rising investor interest. Earlier, the PEPE’s trading volume peaked at $2.13 billion, indicating high investor activity and whale buying. Furthermore, the technical indicators show a strong buying zone, which could propel the PEPE price higher and out of this slump. What’s In There For You? Considering meme-themed cryptocurrency performance this year, many crypto investors turned bullish, with high returns. As a result, 2024 has become the year of meme coins, which users can consider buying after running proper technical analysis and market research. In today’s case, Pepe Coin is gaining strength on the charts after hitting ATH just a few weeks ago. Now, it has to see if the PEPE token will continue to benefit investors or if the PEPE price will struggle with a market dip.

In a report published on December 27, Thorn predicted that while discussions around a Bitcoin reserve policy may progress, the government will focus on managing its existing Bitcoin stockpile rather than acquiring more. Thorn suggested that there might be “movement within departments and agencies to examine an expanded Bitcoin reserve policy.” US Government Holds 183K BTC As of now, the US government holds approximately 183,850 BTC, valued at $17.36 billion, according to blockchain analysis platform Spot on Chain . This Bitcoin is spread across various known wallet addresses. Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis has proposed the Bitcoin Act, which, if enacted, would significantly shift the government’s approach. The act outlines a plan for the US Treasury to purchase 200,000 BTC annually over five years, building a reserve of one million Bitcoin to be held for at least 20 years. Galaxy Digital analyst “JW” also weighed in, suggesting that up to five Nasdaq 100 companies and five nation-states could add Bitcoin to their balance sheets or sovereign wealth funds in the near future. JW argued that increasing global competition might push nations, particularly those unaligned with or adversarial to the US, to adopt Bitcoin mining or accumulation strategies. 21 – The U.S. government will not purchase Bitcoin in 2025, but it will create a stockpile using coins it already holds, and there will be some movement within the departments and agencies to examine an expanded Bitcoin reserve policy. – @intangiblecoins — Galaxy Research (@glxyresearch) December 27, 2024 Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has recently expressed skepticism, noting on December 26 that the Japanese government lacked sufficient understanding of the actions being taken by the US or other nations regarding Bitcoin reserves. Meanwhile, former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao speculated that smaller nations might be the first to adopt Bitcoin reserves. Speaking at the Bitcoin MENA conference in Abu Dhabi on December 9, Zhao also suggested that China could eventually embrace a strategic Bitcoin reserve, although he acknowledged that such changes would likely unfold gradually. US States Consider Adding Bitcoin To Reserves Ohio has become the latest US state to consider adding Bitcoin to its treasury reserves, following the introduction of a new bill by House Republican leader Derek Merrin. The initiative mirrors recent moves by Texas and Pennsylvania to establish Bitcoin reserves. On 12 December 2024, Texas Representative Giovanni Capriglione introduced the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act, which proposes that the state comptroller hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset for at least five years. Pennsylvania took a similar step in November, with Representative Mike Cabell proposing a bill to allow its treasury to allocate up to 10% of its balance sheet in Bitcoin, citing the asset’s potential to hedge against economic uncertainty. Furthermore, corporate Bitcoin holders like MicroStrategy and Metaplanet have expanded their Bitcoin holdings. MARA Holdings (MARA) has also bought 11,774 BTC in the latest acquisition, the company announced on X on Dec. 10. Likewise, Riot Platforms, a Bitcoin mining company, announced plans to raise $500 million through a private bond offering to bolster its Bitcoin reserves further.

Trump Cyborg (TRUMPCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCYB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Cyborg launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Cyborg on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Cyborg by entering its contract address – 9yaNQ89EaQ2nEDczZpuTZfDwfiYCxbwSYC4JeiWLDE57 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCYB.

Rossi claims in a lawsuit filed in San Francisco Superior Court that Akridge exploited his superior knowledge of cryptocurrencies to siphon staking rewards from her digital wallet, according to a report by Bloomberg . Staking, a process that involves pledging cryptocurrency assets to validate blockchain transactions, can yield significant returns in the form of additional tokens. Akridge Reportedly Controlled Her Accounts Rossi’s complaint alleges that Akridge covertly controlled her accounts, reaping all the staking commissions allocated to her. The value of the disputed tokens has been redacted in the court documents, but Rossi has described the amounts involved as “significant.” She has also requested portions of the case remain confidential due to the sensitive financial details. The legal dispute follows the couple’s divorce filing in February 2023 after a decade of marriage. Rossi is seeking damages for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and fraud. NEW: Stephen Akridge, a co-founder of @solanalabs and holder of Solana tokens, a digital asset that has a total market cap of over $90 billion, is facing legal action in San Francisco state court. — Michael A. Mora (@MichaelAdamMora) December 26, 2024 Solana, known for its rapid transaction speeds and growing ecosystem, has been a standout performer in the cryptocurrency market despite earlier setbacks, including its association with Sam Bankman-Fried and the FTX collapse. The platform’s recent resurgence in value has further amplified interest in the tokens at the center of the lawsuit. According to Rossi, Akridge previously worked at Qualcomm Inc. and served as Solana’s principal engineer, collaborating closely with co-founders Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal. The lawsuit proceeds under the title Rossi v. Akridge, CGC-24-620900. Solana DEX Trading Volume Surpasses $100B Solana achieved over $100 billion in decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume for the second consecutive month in December. With a $107.865 billion in monthly DEX volume (as of Dec. 27), Solana outpaced its competitors in December, including Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Ethereum ( ETH ), which recorded $91.444 billion and $84.168 billion. In November, Solana also reigned supreme with $129.736 billion in DEX volume, well ahead of Ethereum’s $70.635 billion. As reported, Solana has overtaken Ethereum as the top destination for new developers in 2024, breaking Ethereum’s eight-year dominance in the space. According to a December 12 report by Electric Capital, Solana saw 7,625 new developers join its ecosystem this year, surpassing Ethereum’s 6,456. The surge was driven largely by increased developer activity in Asia. Notably, Solana also briefly surpassed Ethereum on two significant occasions. On March 18, Solana’s network activity exceeded Ethereum’s due to heightened demand for Solana-based meme coins. Later, on October 28, Solana’s daily network fee generation surpassed Ethereum’s for a 24-hour period. In another incident, earlier this month, prominent blockchain researcher Max Resnick announced that he has shifted from Ethereum infrastructure firm ConsenSys to SOL-focused R&D company Anza. Resnick previously led research at ConsenSys’ Special Mechanisms Group, where he voiced support for alternative scaling models.

The CIA & NSA deployed BTC to prevent foreign powers from developing similar tech that would dominate digital payments, and make billions. “Satoshi Nakamoto” is an organization. pic.twitter.com/rxtIWN1HZE — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) December 26, 2024 Bitcoin’s Alleged Government Origins Farina argues that Bitcoin was created by the NSA as a “beta test coin”. According to his theory, the pseudonymous “Satoshi Nakamoto” is not an individual but rather an organization linked to intelligence agencies. Farina posits that the major reason for creating Bitcoin was to monitor and control global financial transactions, serving as a precursor to central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). He also highlights Bitcoin’s limitations as a functional currency, emphasizing issues such as high fees, slow transaction speeds, and the reliance on secondary solutions like the Lightning Network to facilitate smaller transactions. Farina concludes that these shortcomings render Bitcoin unsuitable for widespread financial adoption, particularly for CBDCs. XRP as Bitcoin 2.0 Farina claims that XRP was designed to address Bitcoin’s inefficiencies, describing it as “Bitcoin 2.0.” He credits XRP’s co-creators— David Schwartz , Jed McCaleb, and Arthur Brito—with building a more practical and scalable blockchain solution. Farina highlights XRP’s speed, low transaction costs, and ability to handle large-scale financial transactions as key advantages over Bitcoin. He further argues that XRP is uniquely positioned to become the backbone of the global financial system, particularly in the context of CBDCs . Farina asserts that XRP’s regulatory compliance and technical capabilities make it the only digital asset capable of dethroning Bitcoin and facilitating instant, large-scale value transfers. Implications for the Financial System Farina suggests that blockchain technology, including Bitcoin and XRP, is fundamentally aimed at enabling CBDCs. He dismisses the notion that Bitcoin was created to undermine traditional financial systems, framing it instead as a government-controlled experiment. In his view, XRP and similar assets represent the “final product” intended to integrate seamlessly into a revamped global financial system.

He advises individuals to invest in XRP and other promising digital assets, positioning them as key components of the future financial landscape. He predicts that XRP holders will benefit from opportunities such as lending their holdings to financial institutions and earning yields without selling their assets. Controversial Assertions and Public Reaction Farina’s claims have drawn criticism and skepticism from many within the cryptocurrency community. While the idea of government involvement in Bitcoin’s creation has been discussed in conspiracy theories, there is no concrete evidence for this narrative. While XRP’s capabilities are well-documented, the assertion that it was designed by the same people behind Bitcoin lacks credibility. Farina’s assertions raise important questions about the transparency and governance of blockchain technologies. Regardless of whether his claims hold merit, they underscore the need for continued scrutiny and debate within the cryptocurrency space.

She questioned the IRS’s rationale, arguing that the ruling incorrectly classifies DeFi platforms as brokers, despite their role being only a part of transaction processes. Uniswap CEO Expresses Similar Concerns Uniswap CEO Hayden Adams expressed similar concerns, stating that he hopes the ruling will be overturned through the Congressional Review Act (CRA) or legal challenges. The IRS’s new regulations, unveiled on December 27, mandate brokers to report gross proceeds from digital asset transactions, including cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This expanded scope now includes front-end DeFi platforms and is set to be implemented in 2027. Critics argue that these requirements are ill-suited for the decentralized nature of such platforms, which often lack the infrastructure for traditional reporting. Robin Singh, CEO of crypto tax platform Koinly, warned that compliance could impose significant operational and technical burdens on decentralized businesses. “The decentralized structure of these platforms makes traditional reporting exceptionally challenging,” Singh noted. 5/ If you are a customer of a front-end trading service, expect the following in the future: – Share your KYC info similar to CeFi exchanges during onboarding. – Receive tax forms with only proceeds (you will still have to use a crypto tax software tool to keep track of your… — Shehan (@TheCryptoCPA) December 27, 2024 Bill Hughes, a lawyer at blockchain development firm Consensys, described the ruling as “all cost, no benefit” and criticized its global reach, which demands reporting for both U.S. and international users. He predicted that the regulation would face Congressional review and potential disapproval. Critics also slammed the IRS for releasing the ruling during the holiday season, suggesting an intentional move to limit public response. Jake Chervinsky, Chief Legal Officer at venture capital firm Variant, labeled the rule an “unlawful” measure by the outgoing administration’s “anti-crypto army.” He argued that it could be overturned by the courts or a new administration. Crypto Veterans Call on New Congress to Repeal the Regulations Alexander Grieve of Paradigm called for the new Congress to repeal the regulations through the CRA. “Treasury/IRS just dropped their DeFi broker regs, which impose substantial centralized reporting requirements on DeFi (starting Jan 1, 2027), and hoover up user data to the govt,” he wrote on X. “The new pro-crypto Congress can, and should, roll these back via the CRA process next year.” Miles Jennings, General Counsel at a16z Crypto, accused the IRS of overstepping by redefining “effectuate transactions” to encompass DeFi activity. When you challenge government abuses of power, the response is even more transparent and desperate abuses. The broker reporting rule is an obvious example — A fantastical expansion of the words “effectuate transactions” to enable the IRS to ban DeFi. This despite courts… — miles jennings (@milesjennings) December 27, 2024 Advocacy groups like the Blockchain Association echoed these sentiments, calling the rule a final effort to drive the U.S. crypto industry offshore. “On behalf of the industry, we’re prepared to take aggressive action to fight back. We also look forward to working with the new pro-crypto Congress and Administration to roll back this and other anti-innovation rules.” Kristin Smith, the group’s CEO, emphasized the urgent need for policymakers to reconsider the broader implications of the ruling.

Due to BTC’s steep correction and failure to recover, the outlook for altcoins looks bleak. Although Ripple rallied nearly 500% in the past few weeks, these five signs suggest XRP price could crash to $1 soon. 5 Sell Signals That Suggest XRP Price Could Crash to $1 Let’s explore five sell signals hinting at a drop in XRP price to $1. Due to BTC’s weakness, the crypto market outlook could trigger a crash that impacts even XRP. A plummet in XRP network activity and daily active addresses suggests that investors are not interested in the remittance token. This drop in investor activity could lead to a significant correction. The 365-day MVRV indicator hints at massive unrealized profits, which could trigger a crash if these holders attempt to realize profits. Whales have continued to offload their holdings for the past month. Technicals suggest XRP price could trigger a 31% crash as it hovers inside a descending triangle. General Crypto Market Weakness Affects XRP Price Bitcoin’s 15% drop from ATH of $108,421 caused crypto markets to crumble. Top altcoins, including XRP, that were up massively have retraced most of their gains. Due to altcoins’ high correlation with Bitcoin, they tend to follow the path set by the leader. With BTC showing signs of a further decline, XRP price will also follow suit, potentially tagging the $1 level. Decline in Daily Active Addresses & Network Growth When the network’s growth and daily active addresses drop, it indicates that investors, both new and existing, are not interested in the token at the current price level. This often happens after an uptrend, where both the metrics tank, suggesting an exodus of investors and hints at a potential reversal of Ripple price to $1. XRP DAA, Network Growth Ripple Long-Term Holders’ Massive Unrealized Gains The 365-day MVRV for Ripple stands at 77%, showing that investors who purchased XRP in the past year at an average profit of 77%. During the yearly high, this number stood at 200%. High unrealized gains often become a source of selling pressure if investors decide to book profits. This is the third sign that hints XRP price could crash to $1 again. XRP 365-day MVRV Ripple Whales Sell XRP Between November 29 and December 28, whales holding between 100 K and 1 M XRP offloaded 110 M tokens. This selloff could be another reason why XRP price has crashed 32% from the yearly high of $2.90. If this trend continues, XRP price could crash down to $1. XRP Whales XRP Price Analysis: A Crash to $1 Likely XRP price has formed a descending triangle setup, which contains lower highs and equal lows, connected by trend lines. This setup often leads to bearish breakouts and forecasts a 31% crash to $1.34, obtained by measuring the triangle’s height and adding it to the base at $1.95. For this setup to be successful, XRP price needs to break below the $1.95 support level, which is the triangle’s base. If bulls fail to stabilize Ripple at $1.34, it could trigger a further drop to $1. XRP/USDT 4-hour chart On the other hand, if Bitcoin reverses the bearish outlook, then XRP price could. In such a case, a recovery from $1.34 leading to a breakout above the triangle’s declining trend line will signal a bullish outlook. Such a development could lead to a revisit of $2.90 followed by $3.

This move requires these protocols to disclose Know Your Customer (KYC) information for digital asset transactions. The IRS estimates that up to 875 DeFi brokers could be affected by these new rules, which has quickly triggered a community backlash. In simple terms, the new rules say that certain DeFi platforms, which help people buy and sell digital assets, will now be treated like brokers. On top of that, the proposed KYC details are creating security issues in the investor’s mind and legal experts are strongly objecting to the move stating it as constitutional violation. In response, the IRS stated that this will help make sure people are paying the right taxes. However, many people in the crypto world are worried about these new requirements. Lawsuit Filed to Counter the IRS Rule In place of the controversy, the Blockchain Association, in collaboration with the DeFi Education Fund and the Texas Blockchain Council, has filed a lawsuit against the IRS, challenging the new regulations.

Moreover, the legal community is also not happy with the laws, Jake Chervinsky, chief legal officer at Variant, called the rule “the dying gasp of the anti-crypto army” and urged that it be overturned either by the courts or the new administration. Community Pours Their Support Adding to the sentiments, Miles Jennings, general counsel of a16z Crypto, criticized the rule as an overreach, calling it a “fantastical expansion” of the term “effectuate transactions.” He warned that the new rules could potentially allow the IRS to regulate or even ban DeFi platforms.

Notably, recent market stats indicate that the US Spot BTC ETFs closed the week with $287 million outflows, raising market concerns amid BTC price dip to $94K. In turn, crypto enthusiasts are now thoroughly monitoring the flagship token’s future price movements amid declining institutional interest and recent volatility. Bitcoin ETFs Record $287M In Outflows Raising Market Concerns As per the latest data offered by Farside Investors , Bitcoin ETFs recorded $287.9 million worth of outflows as of December 27. The remarkable outflows, underlining declining institutional interest, have raised severe investor uncertainty amid the market’s current volatility. Data indicated that Fidelity’s FBTC registered $208.2 million in outflows yesterday. Further, even Ark Invest’s ARKB witnessed $112.6 million in outflows. Also, Bitwise’s BITB reported $36 million in outflows, whereas Invesco’s BTCO saw $14.2 million. Besides, it’s also worth mentioning that BlackRock’s IBIT saw $79.4 million in inflows. Nevertheless, data collectively hinted at a considerable decline in institutional interest, raising concerns over the flagship crypto’s future movements. Conversely, CoinGape also reported that BTC ETFs saw $450 million worth of inflows recently, which adds a contrasting tint to the asset’s future movements. The strong inflow suggests that a recovery for Bitcoin may also be possible moving ahead, whilst the current outflows are a direct result of market volatility. What’s Next For BTC? At the time of reporting, BTC price tanked nearly 0.5% intraday and is currently sitting at $94,214. Its 24-hour low and high were $93,310.74 and $97,294.85, respectively. Notably, weekly charts show a 5% drop in value, mirroring a turbulent crypto market whilst also aligning with outflows in Bitcoin ETF. The turbulency aligns with the U.S. Fed’s hawkish stance on rate cuts, with no major macroeconomic events until the next year. However, it’s worth mentioning that BTC whales are buying the dip, as reported by CoinGape. Besides, long-term prospects for the flagship crypto remain optimistic across the broader industry. Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki, a renowned name across the crypto industry, anticipates BTC price hitting $350K by 2025. Overall, despite the outflows and recent market volatility, Bitcoin showcases the potential for further gains ahead.

Calling the decision “idiotic,” Gasparino faced criticism from crypto market enthusiasts and lawyers. His remarks not only sparked controversy but also highlighted differing perspectives on the implications of the case for the crypto industry. XRP News: Lawyer Criticizes Charles Gasparino’s Comment In the latest interview with Anthony Pompliano, Gasparino criticized Judge Torres for allegedly establishing a precedent of lesser disclosure for retail investors compared to institutions. Referring to the judge’s decision as “stupid,” he argued it could harm retail investor protections. However, crypto influencer Tony Edward countered this viewpoint, accusing Gasparino of bias. Edward said Gasparino’s stance suggests that “he wants Ripple to lose. Judge Torres clearly stated secondary market sales are not securities because many investors would not know who the hell Ripple is.” Edward further pointed out that investors in secondary markets often have no ties to Ripple, underscoring the legitimacy of the court’s distinction. In addition, lawyer Bill Morgan offered a different perspective, asserting Gasparino lacks understanding of the case. He emphasized that the ruling only addressed Ripple’s programmatic sales, not all secondary market transactions. Morgan added, “As for Charles Gasparino, it is quite apparent he does not understand XRP or crypto.” Ripple Case In Focus Amid Recent Market Developments Gasparino has consistently criticized the SEC’s approach, accusing the agency of misplaced priorities. He highlighted the leniency shown to figures like Sam Bankman-Fried while Ripple faced aggressive scrutiny. According to him, this selective enforcement reflects regulatory overreach. Despite acknowledging Ripple’s technological potential, Gasparino lamented its forced shift overseas due to unclear U.S. regulations. In the latest XRP news, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse echoed similar frustrations, calling the SEC’s actions an industry-wide threat. He argued that the agency’s failure to provide clear guidance hampers innovation in the U.S. crypto sector. Meanwhile, the focus on the XRP lawsuit intensified with a crucial deadline approaching next month. In addition, speculations are soaring about whether the incoming US SEC Chair will drop the ongoing Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit. Notably, Ripple’s partial victory in 2023 brought relief to the XRP community. The court ruled that secondary market sales of XRP are not securities, separating these transactions from direct institutional sales. However, the re-appeal of the US SEC has further fueled speculations. Despite that, it appears that the market sentiment remained strong, especially as Donald Trump’s election win fueled optimism over a pro-crypto regulatory environment in the US. XRP price also recorded a robust rally since November, before witnessing a volatile trading in recent weeks amid a broader market downturn. However, despite the gloomy sentiment, analysts remained optimistic about the future trajectory of Ripple’s native crypto. In a recent analysis, a top expert even predicted Ripple’s native crypto to soar past the $20 mark ahead.

BRETT cryptocurrency, a meme coin on the Base blockchain, has gained popularity due to its community-driven nature and fixed supply, which enhances scarcity. While it shows growth potential, especially with integrations in DeFi, its value is highly speculative and influenced by market trends. Investors are strongly advised to exercise caution and conduct their own research. Will BRETT reach $1? Based on the analysis’s critical prediction, BRETT could reach $1 by 2030, with its potential high projected at $1.16. However, given earlier projections, it is unlikely to reach this milestone before 2030. Will BRETT reach $5? BRETT’s near-term goal of reaching $5 seems unlikely. Current predictions suggest it may peak at around $1 by 2030, influenced by crypto market trends and community support. Is Brett listed on Binance? Brett Coin (BRETT) is currently not listed on Binance for trading. Although, it remains available on other exchanges like Bybit, Gate.io , and KuCoin Does BRETT have a good long-term future?

Co-founded by Jae Kwon and Ethan Buchman in 2014, Cosmos aims to create a decentralized network of blockchains that can communicate and transact seamlessly. Its main components include the Cosmos Hub, which serves as the central chain, and multiple “zones” that operate under their own rules while connecting to the Hub. The platform uses the Tendermint consensus algorithm and Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol to enable fast low-cost transactions. Fees average around $0.01, and confirmation times are approximately seven seconds. Cosmos employs a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism, allowing users to stake their ATOM tokens for network security and transaction validation. Since its ICO in 2017, Cosmos has raised significant funding and established a growing ecosystem, including notable projects like Terra and Binance. With over 286 million ATOM tokens in circulation and a market cap exceeding $7.7 billion, Cosmos is positioned as a key player in the evolving landscape of blockchain technology, often referred to as the “Internet of Blockchains” for its ambitious goal of connecting diverse blockchain networks Overview Cryptocurrency Cosmos Token ATOM Current Price $6.43 Market Cap $2.51B Trading Volume $480.94M Circulating Supply 390.93M ATOM All-time High $ 44.70 on Sept 19, 2021 All-time Low $1.13 on Mar 12, 2020 24-hour High $6.79 24-hour Low $6.41 Cosmos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Prediction $ 8.60 (32.84%) Volatility (30-day variation) 11.63% 50-Day SMA $7.47 14-Day RSI 45.33 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 74 (Greed) Green Days 16/30 (53%) 200-Day SMA $5.95 Cosmos (ATOM) technical price analysis TL; DR Breakdown: ATOM is bearish at $6.431, with resistance at $9.775 and support at $5.568; RSI near 42 suggests limited buying pressure in the 1-Day chart. In the 4-Hour Chart, it trades at $6.438, below the $6.656 SMA. Resistance at $7.039 and support at $6.273, with weak momentum confirmed by a negative MACD crossover. ATOM/USD 1-Day price chart ATOM 1-Day price chart ; Tradingview On December 28, the 1-day chart for Cosmos (ATOM) shows the price at $6.431, below the 20-day SMA of $7.671, indicating bearish momentum. The chart shows resistance at $9.775 (upper Bollinger Band), while support lies near $5.568 (lower Bollinger Band). The RSI is 42.26, leaning towards the oversold region, suggesting reduced buying strength. Also, the recent downward movement on the chart showcases a cooling period after a prior bullish rally. If the price breaks below $5.568, further declines are expected, while a rebound above the SMA at $7.671 could indicate a recovery. On the other hand, Bollinger Bands suggest increased volatility. Traders need to trade cautiously. ATOM/USD 4-hour price chart ATOM 4-hour price chart ; Tradingview The 4-hour Cosmos (ATOM) chart shows the price trading at $6.438, below the 20-SMA at $6.656, indicating bearish sentiment.

The MACD line at -0.106 remains below the signal line at -0.096, confirming bearish momentum. A break below $6.273 could trigger further downside, potentially testing lower levels.

On the daily chart, the price is below the 20-SMA, with resistance at $9.775 and support at $5.568, indicating a larger bearish trend. The 4-hour chart also points in the same direction, with the price below $6.656 (20-SMA) and resistance at $7.039. The MACD and RSI signal weak momentum and minimal buying strength. If the price falls below $6.273, further declines toward $5.568 are likely. However, a reversal above $6.656 could spark recovery, targeting the $7.039 resistance. Caution remains amid low momentum. Is Cosmos a good investment? Cosmos (ATOM) shows potential as an investment due to its innovative approach to blockchain interoperability and recent upgrades like ATOM 2.0. Analysts predict long-term price growth, but the crypto market is highly volatile. Investors should conduct their research and consider risks before investing in ATOM. Is Cosmos a Safe Network? The Cosmos network is built on the Tendermint consensus protocol, offering robust security and interoperability features. However, like all blockchain systems, it faces potential risks, requiring users to remain cautious and well-informed about emerging vulnerabilities and challenges. Will Cosmos reach $50? Based on Cosmo’s current market trends and growth projections, Cosmos (ATOM) is expected to reach a value of approximately $50 by 2029. Will Cosmos reach $100? Current predictions suggest that Cosmos (ATOM) will unlikely reach $100 soon. Analysts estimate it would require a significant increase of over 900% to hit that price. Our forecasts place its maximum potential around $73.66 by 2030, indicating limited short-term growth potential. Does Cosmos have a good long-term future? Cosmos (ATOM) promises a strong long-term future, with forecasts indicating significant price increases over the next decade. Analysts predict that ATOM could reach values as high as $74 by 2030, driven by its unique position in the blockchain ecosystem and ongoing developments in interoperability and scalability. The Cosmos Hub is well-established and supported by a dedicated community, enhancing its growth and adoption prospects in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape.

During the bullish market cycle of 2021, Cosmos saw its price peak at over $44, driven by significant investor interest and market optimism. However, following this surge, on 3rd April 2022, the price of Cosmos (ATOM) sharply declined to $6.39. Since then, Cosmos entered a prolonged phase of consolidation, trading within a range between $6.39 and $16 as market dynamics fluctuated. In early 2024, particularly around 8th March, Cosmos encountered significant resistance at the $13 level, struggling to gain momentum above this point. This resistance reflected broader market sentiment and potential selling pressure. By July 2024, ATOM’s price was trading in a narrower range, between $5 and $6, indicating a lack of upward momentum. By August 2024, the price had further dipped to $4.02, suggesting increasing bearish pressure. This recent decline highlights ongoing challenges for Cosmos in maintaining its price stability and suggests potential further downside as market bears dominate, putting pressure on potential buyers to defend against a continued downward trend. On September 2024, the Cosmos price ranged between $4 to $5, and on October 06, the price traded at $4.5837 with a trading volume of $48.48M. On November 5, ATOM was trading at $4.10. By December 5, ATOM’s price surged significantly, trading at $10.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ATOM|BLOCKCHAIN|ICO|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-28 08:49:40

Market participants who entered during the token’s recent rally are experiencing losses, though sentiment remains hopeful. Some prominent crypto analysts suggest that XRP may soon break through this period of consolidation to reach new heights. Conditions for XRP Rally to $4.50 Crypto influencer Ben Armstrong, known as “BitBoy,” has outlined the critical level XRP must surpass to initiate its next significant price rally. In a recent tweet, Armstrong emphasized the importance of XRP closing daily and weekly candles above $2.75. If this condition is met, he believes the digital asset could achieve a rally to $4.50. When $XRP is closing daily and weekly candles above $2.75 it’s time to rock and roll to $4.50 — The BitBoy (@BenArmstrongsX) December 17, 2024 XRP briefly reached $2.72 after Ripple announced the launch of its stablecoin, RLUSD . Many anticipated that this news would catalyze XRP’s price, but the token quickly retraced, largely impacted by Bitcoin’s market downturn. Despite this, Armstrong maintains that reclaiming the $2.75 level remains the key trigger for XRP’s upward movement. He has also suggested that this price target could be reached by the end of the year. XRP’s Path Toward Reclaiming Its All-Time High Adding to the bullish outlook, another prominent crypto analyst named “360 Trader” has presented an even more optimistic perspective. The analyst predicts that XRP is on the verge of recovering its all-time high (ATH) of $3.84 and establishing a strong price base above it. They argue this would provide the foundation for XRP’s “true” bull run, potentially leading to unprecedented price levels. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Sentiment: Optimism vs. Skepticism The broader crypto community continues to monitor XRP’s performance with mixed expectations. Optimists point to potential catalysts, including the anticipated resolution of Ripple’s ongoing legal battle and the possible approval of an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). Both developments are expected to boost market confidence significantly. On the other hand, skeptics caution against overestimating XRP’s potential in the near term. Some predict a possible decline to $0.50 , citing historical patterns and market volatility as key risks. As the end of the year approaches, XRP’s price movement remains a focal point for analysts and investors alike. While the asset has been trading within a narrow range over the past two weeks, key developments and market trends could dictate its next major move. Whether XRP can meet Armstrong’s $2.75 threshold and surge to $4.50, or face further pullbacks, remains to be seen. However, enthusiasts and critics agree that the coming months will be pivotal for the digital asset’s trajectory.

The nation, known for its abundant hydroelectric resources, saw tax receipts from crypto mining fall by 50% compared to the previous year. How Does Kyrgyzstan Tax Crypto Mining? According to a report by the Ministry of Economy and Finance, Kyrgyzstan collected just 46.6 million Kyrgyzstani soms (around $535,000) in mining taxes this year, a significant decrease from the 93.7 million soms ($1.08 million) collected in 2023. The decline was evident early on, with a 29.7% drop in revenue during the first seven months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Kyrgyzstan imposes a 10% tax on the electricity used by crypto miners, which also includes value-added tax (VAT) and sales tax. This taxation model initially helped boost revenue, particularly during the early stages of 2023. Back then, the country reported a dramatic increase in mining taxes, collecting 78.6 million soms ($883,000) in the first few months, far exceeding the 11.1 million soms ($133,200) collected during the same period in 2022. What’s Behind the Decline? The reasons for the sharp drop in mining tax revenue remain unclear. Some suggest that regulatory uncertainties or reduced mining activity may have contributed. Additionally, Kyrgyzstan’s affordable hydroelectric power has made it an attractive place for crypto miners, but recent changes in energy policies or costs may have impacted the sector. New Opportunities for Mining Despite the fall in tax revenue, there are ideas worldwide to improve crypto mining. In Germany, for example, miners use extra renewable energy to power Bitcoin operations, which helps reduce energy waste and stabilize power grids. Countries like Kyrgyzstan could explore similar solutions to boost the sector while supporting their economy. This decline in tax revenue is a challenge for Kyrgyzstan, but it also opens doors to rethink strategies and create a more sustainable future for cryptocurrency mining.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-28 09:00:05

Historically, Bitcoin has outperformed traditional asset classes, including the S&P 500 and gold, and this trend is expected to continue as it captures approximately 20% of gold’s market capitalization.

With over $36 billion in net inflows recorded in 2024, these ETPs have become the most successful launch cohort in history, attracting investments from major hedge funds and institutional players. As Bitcoin solidifies its position as a leading asset, Galaxy Research forecasts that at least one prominent wealth management platform will recommend a Bitcoin allocation of 2% or more. This shift is expected to further drive inflows into Bitcoin ETPs, increasing their AUM. The report also highlights the likelihood of reaching consensus on significant protocol upgrades among Bitcoin developers, which has historically been difficult to achieve, and is expected to include enhancements that improve transaction programmability. Dogecoin Poised For Resurgence Ethereum is projected to trade above $5,500 in 2025, driven by easing regulatory constraints on decentralized finance (DeFi) and increased institutional interest. Galaxy Research anticipates that Ethereum staking rates will surpass 50%, with the possibility of spot-based ETH exchange-traded funds being allowed to stake a portion of the ETH they hold. The decentralized finance (DeFi) market on Bitcoin is also expected to grow significantly. The amount of Bitcoin locked in DeFi smart contracts could nearly double in 2025, according to the firm.

The report also predicts that Dogecoin will reach a market cap of $100 billion, potentially crossing the $1 mark amidst broader market dynamics, including institutional adoption and new regulatory frameworks that may influence the future of meme-based cryptocurrencies. In the regulatory arena, Galaxy Research anticipates that bipartisan legislation governing stablecoin issuance will be enacted by the end of 2025, providing a clear framework for issuers. At present, BTC is trading at $94,648, showing a 1% loss in the last 24 hours. Ethereum, conversely, is priced at $3,359, reflecting a 1% increase over the same period. Dogecoin is priced at $0.314, experiencing minimal gains of only 0.5% during this timeframe.

Gasparino made harsh comments about the SEC’s handling of the Ripple case, calling the regulation unnecessary. He discussed the possibility that the ruling might be reversed, potentially putting Ripple back under legal scrutiny. He noted that with changes in political leadership, such as the potential influence of Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump is an American former president politician, businessman, and media personality, who served as the 45th president of the U.S. between 2017 to 2021. Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President there could be shifts in how the SEC handles the case. Gasparino made it clear that, as a reporter, he remains neutral in the crypto debate and will cover the story objectively, regardless of the outcome, as he does not have any personal stake in XRP. “I think there’s a chance it gets reversed and XRP and Ripple’s back on the hook. The SEC may drop the whole thing now that Trump’s in there. That’s a whole other thing you have to worry about. And this is why I get it from both sides, both pro-crypto and anti-crypto,” He Said. Ripple Case Under Paul Atkins There is growing speculation about how the Ripple case could be affected by the incoming SEC chair, Paul Atkins, following the resignation of the current chair, Gary Gensler, on January 20, the same day as President Trump’s inauguration. The SEC’s filing deadline for its appeal is approaching on January 15, after the agency requested a 90-day extension in October, pushing the deadline past the US Presidential Election. The transcripts for the appeal are set to be ordered by December 31 and must be fully delivered by January 30, 2025.

Instead, officials may focus on managing and safeguarding their existing Bitcoin reserve, totaling around 183,850 BTC, worth $17.36 billion, as identified by blockchain analytics platform Spot on Chain. Focus Shifts to Bitcoin Reserve Policy Alex Thorn, Galaxy Digital’s head of research, highlighted that while no direct purchases are anticipated, discussions about a broader Bitcoin reserve policy could gain momentum within federal departments and agencies. Thorn suggested this could involve strategies to solidify Bitcoin as a critical reserve asset for the nation. A significant proposal in this context is Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis’ Bitcoin Act 2024 . If enacted, the legislation would enable the government to systematically acquire 200,000 BTC annually over five years, building a substantial reserve of 1 million Bitcoin to be held for at least 20 years. The potential for such a policy underscores growing recognition of Bitcoin’s role as a strategic asset. Global Ripple Effects of US Bitcoin Strategy The US government’s actions—or inaction—on Bitcoin could have far-reaching implications. Galaxy Digital analyst “JW” pointed out that as Bitcoin continues to gain traction, up to five Nasdaq 100 companies and an equal number of nation-states might integrate Bitcoin into their balance sheets or sovereign wealth funds. JW also warned of a potential race among nations to mine or acquire Bitcoin, especially unaligned nations or those with adversarial relations to the US. “Competition among nation-states, particularly those with significant sovereign wealth or geopolitical ambitions, could accelerate Bitcoin adoption strategies,” JW explained. While some countries, like Japan, remain cautious, others are exploring Bitcoin’s potential as a reserve asset . Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba expressed uncertainty about the global shift toward Bitcoin adoption, noting that Japan was not yet prepared to formalize its stance. Meanwhile, former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao speculated that smaller nations might be the first to adopt Bitcoin reserve, with China possibly leading strategic adoption efforts. As the conversation around Bitcoin reserve intensifies, the US’s next steps will likely shape global attitudes toward cryptocurrency as a financial and geopolitical tool.

Bitcoin enjoyed a spark towards the latter end of 2024, with the asset bursting out after a Trump-fuelled rally. It is no surprise that it did a remarkable job hitting over $100k this year. While Bitcoin did about 50% since November 3, other assets followed suit, with Dogecoin posting double its price. While the crypto assets enjoyed a stellar run towards the end of the year, gold has been dominating, having itself a wonderful year. Prices of the precious metal surged by 28%, pushing financial investors back to the asset as a safe haven amid rising geopolitical and economic tensions. Gold started the year at $2014, having itself a wonderful year amid several highs before hitting $2,719 in late November. Experts predict a wonderful 2025 for gold Usually, most assets in the financial market experience a pullback after a huge rally like gold’s. Investors are conversant with the market, more reason why they remain unfazed by the asset’s recent drop to around $2,603. But with many Western countries starring inflation in the eye amid other geopolitical issues, investors are predicting a great 2025 for gold. Gold Bullion Company’s Managing Director Rick Kanda lauded the asset’s rise in 2024, noting that it was a record year for the asset. “There’s no denying that 2024 has been a record year for gold,” Kanda said. He also made bold predictions about the precious metal heading into the new year. “It’s reached colossal new highs and broken records. This is… a result of economic uncertainty, changes in global inflation , and also increased demand,” he added. Gold has usually done well, especially when investors shift their funds into the asset while relying less on bond markets and equity. The popular notion is that gold also serves other purposes, giving it an inherent value. For instance, aside from its use as a currency, the asset is also used to mark jewelry and other technological products. According to UK-based gold marketplace Bullion Vault, investors are skeptical about the current global situation getting better next year. With Donald Trump preparing to enter the White House , experts are expecting several conflicts. In addition, the platform says it expects its users to consolidate their positions instead of selling. The recent survey carried out by the firm among its users shows that they believe the asset could hit $3,070 by 2025. Most of the respondents cited geopolitical tensions and economic issues driving the growth of the yellow metal. Donald Trump’s Bitcoin crusade amid rising debts With most people using the economic situation and geopolitical tensions as their reasons for holding gold, others are pointing to the increase in sovereign debt. Economies across the West are currently witnessing huge deficits as economic growths continue to mount pressure on countries to increase state spending. This trend had previously emerged in 2007/8 with the pandemic causing it to worsen. Meanwhile, Donald Trump may be relying on his new-found Bitcoin love. With most countries pushing to establish their Bitcoin reserve, the United States is looking to lead the pack. President-elect Donald Trump recently confirmed plans for a national Bitcoin reserve after Bitcoin hit above the $100k mark for the first time. In his speech at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Trump said the United States could do something nice with BTC. He highlighted the need to be ahead of other countries, a notion that the incoming United States President has always echoed. “We’re gonna do something great with crypto because we don’t want China, or anybody else… but others are embracing it, and we want to be ahead,” he said. However, the idea seems not to resonate with everyone as critics have poked holes in the strategy. Skeptics are seeing the move as the United States government playing a fool. They see the strategy as an avenue to run up borrowing costs, which could prove dire for the country. It could worsen the already bad inflation numbers, and the dollar would be at the receiving end. A Bitcoin reserve could also open financial institutions up for Bitcoin adoption, allowing customers to use the asset as collateral for loans. If the asset drops, it could prove costly for the financial institution.

These digital assets, often driven by strong community support and perceived decentralization, are no longer just a laughing matter; they’ve become a force to be reckoned with. As we approach 2025, it’s time to take a closer look at some of the top meme coins by market capitalization that are capturing attention, and possibly, investment. The power of community What sets meme coins apart is their fervent community backing. In many cases, these projects are more influenced by community decisions than other crypto ventures, adding to their perceived decentralization. While the actual level of decentralization is debatable, the fact remains that these coins enjoy massive participation and enthusiasm from their holders. So, with the end of 2024 in sight, let’s explore three meme coins that should be on every crypto-enthusiast’s radar in January 2025. Dogecoin (DOGE): the original meme coin pioneer First up is Dogecoin, the undisputed OG of the meme coin world. Conceived as a lighthearted joke in 2013 by Jackson Palmer, a product manager at Adobe, and Billy Markus, a software developer at IBM, Dogecoin, with its Shiba Inu dog mascot, has become a cultural phenomenon. This open-source, peer-to-peer cryptocurrency, inspired by Litecoin, experienced a massive surge during the 2017 bull run, before declining with the 2018 crash. However, thanks to a very strong community, especially one fronted by Elon Musk, Dogecoin has made a huge comeback. Musk, a vocal proponent of Dogecoin, champions its utility as a low-fee, blockchain-based payment mechanism. The current price of Dogecoin stands at $0.31, with a market cap of $47.2 billion, and it has seen a YTD change of +258%. Dogecoin’s price has surged over 200% since November 2024, making it a top-performing memecoin. While the price has undergone a slight correction, trading near the $0.3 level, a breakout above $0.4 is critical for Dogecoin to regain its bullish momentum. On the downside, the $0.35 level provides significant support, aligned with its 50-day EMA. Shiba Inu (SHIB): the “Dogecoin killer” Next is Shiba Inu, arguably the second most recognizable meme-inspired crypto asset. Launched anonymously by “Ryoshi” in August 2020, Shiba Inu aims to be the “Dogecoin Killer.” Unlike Dogecoin, Shiba Inu is an Ethereum-based altcoin, but it also features a Shiba Inu as its mascot. After a tough 2022, Shiba Inu has shown moderate recovery, following the wider market recovery led by heavyweights like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The coin has a current price of $0.000022, with a market cap of $13.13 billion, and has seen a YTD change of +115.5%. Despite facing a 40% retracement from its December 2024 highs, Shiba Inu’s strong community has remained steadfast, actively supporting the token. The Shiba Inu ecosystem is evolving, with a metaverse where players can interact, earn rewards, and enjoy a decentralized experience. SHIB price needs to surpass the $0.00003 level to spark renewed bullish momentum. Immediate support lies near the 200-day EMA. Pepe (PEPE): the frog’s leap into the memecoin scene Finally, there’s Pepe, a relatively new Ethereum-based meme coin that has quickly surged in popularity. Based on the popular internet meme of a green cartoon frog, Pepe arrived with the promise of overthrowing dog-based meme coins. The project has seen explosive growth since launch, with a current price of $0.000018, a market cap of $7.68 billion, and an impressive YTD change of +1309%. According to its website, Pepe is designed to be the “most memorable memecoin,” with the caveat that it has no intrinsic value or expectation of financial return. Despite this, PEPE has demonstrated a remarkable 400% rally since its launch, even breaking into the top 100 coins for a brief period. Pepe coin’s price has recently corrected, along with other market heavyweights. Currently trading below its 50-day EMA, a breakout above this level and the R1 Fibonacci pivot near $0.000025 is needed to regain momentum. The support zone between the 200-day EMA and the S1 Fibonacci pivot is crucial to prevent further losses.

The altcoins have suffered as well, with many violent price corrections from the likes of AVAX, LINK, SUI, and others. BTC’s Struggles See No End The Fed-induced correction began last week as bitcoin dumped from its latest all-time high of over $108,000 to $92,000 in just a few days. It managed to recover some ground last weekend and even spiked to $99,000, but that was short-lived, and the asset headed straight south on Monday. After another slump toward $92,000, the bull took charge and pushed it to a multi-day peak of just under $100,000. However, this rally was halted quickly as well, and bitcoin started losing value once again in the following days. After failing at $97,000 yesterday, the bears drove it down once more to under $94,000. Although it has been able to recover some ground since then and now trades above that line, BTC is still more than 2% down on the day. Its market capitalization has dumped to $1.870 trillion on CG, and its dominance over the alts has retraced to 54.4%. Bitcoin/Price/Chart 28.12.2024.

XRP is well below $2.2, while BNB fights to remain above $700. SOL, ADA, DOGE, and TON have produced losses of up to 3%. Even more painful declines come from AVAX, SUI, LINK, DOT, and HBAR. In fact, Chainlink’s token has plummeted by nearly 10% and is deep beneath $22. Most lower- and mid-cap alts are in a similar state as well.

Polkadot’s price movement has positioned it as a key player in the ongoing bull market , while Bonk’s community-driven growth keeps it in the spotlight. Meanwhile, Lunex Network emerges as a strong contender, capturing investor attention with its potential. This article explores the factors fueling their rise and why they are the focus of market discussions. Lunex Network ’s Growing Influence In The DeFi Space As market sentiments turn bullish, Lunex Network is lauded as a significant player among DeFi platforms, capturing attention from analysts and traders. What sets Lunex Network apart from the competition is its focus on combining technology with user-driven utilities. The platform’s non-custodial wallet and cold storage feature has caused ripples across the decentralized market front. Token holders no longer require third-party custodians of their assets, passwords, and wallet keys. This add-on from Lunex Network clearly aligns with the core values of the crypto movement. Another differentiator is Lunex Network ‘s unified asset tracking that provides users with real-time analytics, simplifying portfolio management and decision-making. This toolset supports novice traders and experts as they navigate the crypto market. In the near term, Lunex Network could stand shoulder to shoulder with other well-known projects, with an exciting future ahead of it. DOT Expected To Catapult By 100% In Near Term Polkadot’s price is trading above $7, reflecting a solid 20% increase over the past month. DOT has maintained stability above its key support level of $6.8, while resistance at $7.2 remains a crucial hurdle for further upward movement. With 16 green days in the past month, DOT currently trades above its 200-day SMA. DOT ’s cross-chain interoperability remains a significant driver of its adoption, with parachain auctions continuing to fuel ecosystem expansion. The MACD level and moving averages indicate a consolidation phase for DOT , which could precede a breakout. Per analysis , DOT is forecasted to rise by 97% and hit $14 in the coming weeks. BONK Burn Event Sparks Excitement In Meme Community Bonk ( BONK ) is experiencing renewed interest after announcing a 1 trillion BONK burn in a BURNmas event . This strategic move has sparked excitement among the community and investors, leading to its appearance in the top gainers list. BONK is currently trading 1,412.30% above the 200-Day SMA as the doggo-themed coin closes in on top 50 status. Technical indicators suggest a short-term bullish trend, with BONK aiming to retest its previous highs. According to crypto analysts like CoinCodex, the price of BONK is predicted to rise by 228% and reach $ 0.0001 before February 2025. If BONK continues to build on its community engagement and market activity, it could sustain its upward momentum. Conclusion The $LNEX presale is now live, with tokens available for just $0.0048 each. In addition to a deflationary system, presale investors who hold LNEX tokens for a minimum of 30 days can earn up to 18% APY in income. Unlike BONK and DOT, the potential for profits on the Lunex Network is limitless. Imagine the possibilities in the next bull market !

Bitcoin’s current value is near $94,000, highlighting the volatility as the year draws to a close. Amidst this uncertainty, the question arises: Is it feasible to transform $1,000 into $10 million in crypto trading by January? Can $1K Turn into $10M in Crypto Trading by January? The prospect of escalating a mere $1,000 investment to an astounding $10 million by January 2025 captivates many in the crypto market sector. Despite the prevalent bearish trends that many crypto news are experiencing, the inherently volatile market conditions suggest. Such a dramatic increase isn’t out of the realm of possibility during a bullish phase. Investors remain hopeful for a market recovery, eyeing significant gains. SPX6900 (SPX) SPX6900 (SPX), a blockchain-based cryptographic token, has recently shown significant promise for diverse scientific uses. Currently priced at $0.799, SPX has climbed 5% in the last day. Over the past month, its value has increased by over 30%. This growth positions SPX6900 as a standout investment. Investors speculate whether turning a $1,000 stake into $10 million by early January could be feasible. As January approaches, many view SPX6900 as a strategic opportunity to amplify initial investments dramatically.

Set to list at $0.0505, DexBoss aims to enhance the DeFi landscape by integrating centralized exchange features into its decentralized platform. The project employs a deflationary strategy, utilizing a buyback-and-burn approach to increase scarcity and potential value for its users. With a capped supply and projected rising demand, DexBoss positions itself as a promising crypto trading investment for those exploring opportunities in decentralized finance. This model supports the project’s goal of sustaining investor interest over the long term. BabyDoge (BABYDOGE) BabyDoge, a leading meme coin on the BNB chain, was originally created as a humorous take with a serious aim to promote animal adoption awareness. This token gained a significant pop culture boost following a tweet from Elon Musk, earning it the status of an endearing symbol. Baby Doge’s main purpose is to cultivate an engaging meme community that champions animal welfare and encourages pet adoption. Presently, it is valued at $0.00000003228, showing an impressive monthly increase of 35.78%. This recent spike in value brings up an intriguing question: this could lead to investing $1,000, realistically turn into $10 million by the beginning of January. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin (DOGE), a meme-based cryptocurrency , has witnessed an impressive 280% surge in its value over the past year. Currently, the price of DOGE stands at $0.316, marking a modest 1% growth in the last 24 hours. This increase consolidates its position as a top crypto trading investment choice for January. Notably, a significant uptick in large-scale transactions exceeding $100,000 has occurred. This rise in whale activity, aligning with the coin’s price spike, signals robust interest from major investors. These large strategic purchases likely influence Dogecoin’s market dynamics and drive its ongoing momentum.

AMP price analysis gives out a bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. Cryptocurrency value has depreciated to a low of $0.00776 over the last 24 hours. AMP coin has devalued up to 2.91% amidst the growing downside. The red candlestick on the one-day price chart marks a downward momentum. Technical indicators give out a neutral verdict regarding the current market scenario. Whereas the price charts confirm a rising bearish activity for the day. Is AMP a good investment? AMP has been struggling with a bearish trend for the past few months. Despite this, its strong fundamentals suggest it could be a solid long-term investment. Crypto analysts suggest that the approaching weeks can steadily increase the cryptocurrency’s value. A bullish rally may be expected in the latter part of this year (2024), potentially pushing the AMP above $0.01. Why is AMP down? AMP’s price has decreased today. Additionally, the coin has experienced a loss of 2.91% if observed over the last 24 hours. The price is trading at $0.00776 as the coin is under a bearish spell for now, moreover, the bears remained on the lead this week. Will AMP reach $0.010? AMP’s resistance level is at $0.005; yet, a break above this level is possible if sufficient buying momentum builds. A break near or above $0.010 will require a more robust push but isn’t impossible, as the coin achieved this level on March 12, 2024. Will AMP reach $1? Amp has never spiked above the $0.12 level. Even this price mark was observed only once at the start of the token’s launch, and AMP has never seen this level. It seems highly unlikely for AMP to achieve $1 soon. Will AMP reach $10? According to Cryptopolitan’s price prediction, AMP will not achieve this level in the next 10 years until something unusual happens. Considering AMP’s current market cap of only $204 million, the scenario seems almost impossible. Does AMP have a good long-term Future? Amp is trading near its average price level if observed over the longest price period levels. It can be a good long-term investment, as its price will double in 2025 and reach $0.068 by 2030.

Following a rejection at $30, LINK has corrected 27% testing crucial support levels at $22. On the other hand, LINK whales have been accumulating at every price dip highlighting bullishness among long-term players. Where is Chainlink Price Moving Next? Chainlink is seeing strong selling pressure with the LINK price today correcting by another 5.7% in the last 24 hours and is currently trading at $21.36 with a market cap of $13.63 billion. The Coinglass data shows a 12% drop in the LINK open interest to $551 million. Also, the 24-hour liquidations have soared to $3.02 million of which $2.83 million is in long liquidation. Popular crypto analyst Solberg Invest has flagged a potential head-and-shoulders pattern forming on Chainlink’s (LINK) chart, suggesting the possibility of a price decline. The analyst noted that if the Chainlink price breaches the pattern’s neckline, the token could target $16.6, with a worst-case scenario seeing a drop to $12.5. This technical formation adds a cautious note to LINK’s outlook, urging traders to monitor the market closely for further developments. Source: Solberg Invest Despite this short-term bearishness, crypto investors continue to remain bullish for the long term. As per the CoinCodex data, 62% of investors believe that the LINK price can shoot up to $35 in the next month and further to $40 over a three-month period. This means that LINK investors can mint nearly 100% gains by the end of Q1 2025. Having said that, it appears that Chainlink could witness a strong rebound ahead if bulls regain momentum. Besides, a recent LINK price prediction showed that the crypto is likely to hit $44 by next month, which has fueled market sentiment. LINK Whale Accumulation on the Rise Blockchain analytics firm Santiment reports that Chainlink price has experienced a major retracement in the latter half of December, mirroring trends across the broader crypto market. Despite the decline, key active whales holding between 1 million and 10 million LINK have taken advantage of the dip to accumulate. As per data from Santiment, these influential holders have added 3.58 million LINK – valued at approximately $76.9 million – over the past three days. Such whale activity is often considered a bullish indicator, suggesting potential long-term support for LINK’s price trajectory. Source: Santiment With the LINK whale continuing to withdraw their assets, the exchange reserves have taken a significant dip. According to data from CryptoQuant, the exchange reserve dropped to 161.5 million highlighting a shift in market dynamics, with large investors moving their holdings away from exchanges.

Overall, cryptocurrency market capitalisation dropped approximately 2.6% to $3.46 trillion by late Friday after hitting a weekly high of $3.6 trillion after Christmas day. A risk-off sentiment prevailed across the market due to a lack of any solid catalysts, and the market lull intensified towards the middle of the week, with liquidity and trading volumes dipping as a result of the holiday season. Early week profit taking by long-term holders and poor performance of US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds kept market sentiment subdued, with the effect spilling over to the altcoin market as well. The crypto fear and greed index had dropped to neutral levels around the low 50s, confirming the lack of momentum in the market. By the end of the week, only a handful of the top tokens managed to retain gains from the post-election rally that began after Donald Trump won the 2024 US elections. Even though some whale buying and institutional activity returned towards the end of the week, analysts remained cautious, with many expecting a deeper correction scenario to play out. Will Bitcoin rise again? Bitcoin showed some late-week resilience after a $14.2 billion options expiry with a ‘max pain’ point of $85,000, which initially had traders anticipating a major correction. However, the flagship cryptocurrency managed to hold above key support levels and even peaked above $97,330 at 9:06 a.m. UTC on Dec. 27, just an hour after the expiry event. Yet, a prominent trader on TradingView pointed to BTC’s negative correlation with the USDT Dominance Index, which measures USDT’s overall market share. Notably, the metric shows signs of a rebound, which is typically seen when BTC hits a local top. Basically, this rebound indicates a capital flight to safety as liquidity moves to Tether when traders expect volatility or further downside pressure. The analyst warns that a potential bulltrap scenario might be playing out soon where the bellwether sees a short spike before quickly correcting. He urged caution as the sudden rise could mislead many into believing the up trend has resumed again. Some other forecasts see Bitcoin dropping towards the $80 – $60k range in the coming days. According to Mark Newton, managing director at Fundstrat, Bitcoin will target price levels as high as $250,000 next year but could correct to as low as $60,000 before that happens. Fellow analyst Benjamin Cohen also expects a similar drop but notes it could be a flash crash on the day Donald Trump takes office , drawing parallels with past performance of the Invesco QQQ Trust as current BTC price action is showing similarities. Meanwhile, analyst Ali Martinez believes Bitcoin needs to hold above $93,806, or else it could risk dropping towards $70k, pointing to factors such as increased BTC transfers to exchanges and increased profit taking. However, a sustained close above $97,300 or a daily close above $100k would invalidate this scenario. At the time of writing, the leading crypto exchanged hands at $94,171, down 2.7% over the past week. A more pronounced drop was seen for several altcoins, but the top performers managed to pull in notable gains over the week. Top altcoins this week Bitget token Bitget (BGB) outperformed the market with an over 100% rally over the past week. The altcoin boasted a market cap of over $11.3 billion, making it the largest altcoin on the list. Source: CoinMarketCap BGB continued to capitalise on the hype generated by several developments that were unveiled over the course of December. Most recently, the altcoin got a boost after the Seychelles-based crypto exchange announced it would merge BGB with the Bitget Wallet Token (BWB) into a single utility token. Prior to that, the exchange’s planned collaboration with the Tron blockchain and its meme coin launcher, SunPump, acted as a catalyst for the past week’s rally. Virtuals protocol Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) was one of the best-performing artificial intelligence-focused cryptocurrencies, with gains of over 44% recorded in the past week. On the yearly time frame, the gains are locked in at over 23,000%, making it one of the best-performing tokens this year. Source: CoinMarketCap VIRTUAL rode the AI agent wave and the broader growth in the AI sector. As a decentralised AI agent network, the protocol has drawn in a plethora of users over the past year to launch such agents. With the number of AI agents increasing on the platform, users have locked in VIRTUAL tokens, leading to a surge in its price. When writing, VIRTUAL held a market cap of $3.36 billion. Movement Movement (MOVE), an Ethereum layer 2 network, rallied 27% this week to hit a market cap of over $2.3 billion late Friday, just weeks after launching earlier in the month. Source: CoinMarketCap MOVE surged amid excitement surrounding its mainnet beta launch and token generation event (TGE) on December 9. 1 billion tokens were distributed as a part of the TGE, which led to increased trading activity. The price rally got a major boost after the network integrated Wrapped Bitcoin on December 19, bringing more liquidity towards its decentralised finance ecosystem. Alongside this, on-metric shows increased activity on the network with a surge in active addresses on the network.

Lee Sang-jun, the former CEO of Bithumb, was sentenced to two years in prison, while Ahn Sung-hyun, a well-known golfer married to actress Song Yu-ri, received a four-and-a-half-year sentence. Altcoin Price Manipulation and Bribes The trial, held on December 26, revealed surprising details about how these individuals attempted to rig the cryptocurrency market . Prosecutors revealed that Lee , in exchange for large bribes, agreed to list a specific altcoin on Bithumb’s platform. In return, Lee received around 3 billion Korean won (roughly $2 million) in cash, along with luxury watches, high-end bags, and even exclusive restaurant memberships. The bribes were given by Kang Jong-hyun, a reclusive businessman and close associate of both Lee and Ahn. His goal was to artificially boost the value of a low-cap altcoin by listing it on Bithumb, causing its price to rise quickly. Golfer Ahn’s Role in the Scam Ahn Sung-hyun played a key role in the plot as well. Businessman Kang provided Ahn with a large sum of money to bribe Lee into listing the altcoin. However, Ahn didn’t stop there. Prosecutors discovered that Ahn kept some of the money for himself and used it to buy stocks. In total, Ahn pocketed 2 billion Korean won (about $1.5 million), which he spent to make personal investments. The court was harsh on Ahn, describing them as “heinous” and accusing him of using stolen funds to further his financial interests. Ahn’s ties to both Lee and Kang played a central role in the crime, revealing a dangerous web of corruption. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Hacks This Week: Pudgy Penguins Phishing Scam Leads the Pack , Kang’s Secret Ownership of Bithumb Kang, the businessman behind the bribes, was sentenced to one and a half years in prison. While his role in the scandal is clear, there is still ongoing investigation into his possible secret ownership of Bithumb. His efforts to manipulate altcoin prices on the exchange were key to this bribery scheme. The case highlights the darker side of the crypto world, where unregulated markets can be easily manipulated for personal profit. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

IBIT's shares also trade at a marginal discount to its premium, and is the only spot Bitcoin ETF that trades at a discount to its premium as compared to peers. On a borad level, institutional demand for Bitcoin ETFs surged, with IBIT managing ~$53 billion, nearly half of the total spot Bitcoin ETF AUMs. The long-term bullish outlook on Bitcoin remains intact, with an expected price ascent through 2025; IBIT trades at a marginal discount, making it attractive. Investment Thesis Last month, Bitcoin finally broke out from the tight trading pattern it held for 7 months on the back of the U.S. election results. This led to the digital asset creating a new ATH record of $106k, backed by the optimism surrounding the pro-Bitcoin stance the incoming U.S. administration is expected to adopt. The bullishness in Bitcoin led to robust inflows into the spot Bitcoin ETFs, which also created their new records. For example, net inflows into Bitcoin ETFs recently crossed $100 billion in AUM and have also overtaken gold AUMs, signaling a strong shift in appetite for Bitcoin as an alternative asset that deserves allocation in portfolios. The price of Bitcoin has pulled back since creating the $106k ATH a few weeks ago, and I believe the digital asset is currently in a consolidation phase with long-term bullish indicators remaining intact. Given my optimism for Bitcoin, I continue to recommend BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (NASDAQ: IBIT ) as the primary vehicle to hold Bitcoin for those investors who prefer Bitcoin exposure via ETFs over digital wallets. IBIT is now the largest spot Bitcoin ETF available, sees healthy inflows, and is cheaper relative to its peers, making this recommendation an easy Buy. IBIT Is The Cheapest ETF Available - See Its Premium To NAV My overall outlook on Bitcoin is bullish, and I continue to expect Bitcoin to move higher through next year on the back of improved price discovery and elevated demand rising not just from retail investors but also institutional buyers. In my last note on IBIT, I explained why IBIT presented itself “as a stable alternative for investors looking to invest in Bitcoin without the bells and whistles that come with directly investing in Bitcoin.” In that note, I talked about strong retail interest, which was driving momentum in spot Bitcoin ETFs such as IBIT, and how the Bitcoin halving that occurred earlier this year would eventually lead to decelerating Bitcoin supply and higher prices. Heavy institutional demand in spot Bitcoin ETFs has led to surging asset volumes for Bitcoin ETFs, leading to one of the sharpest spikes in AUMs among spot Bitcoin ETFs. 21Shares, an ETP firm that specializes in crypto-based ETFs/ETPs and partners with ARK on certain crypto ETFs in the US, issued a report last month where they noted that: Institutions strategically accumulated more bitcoin ETF shares during Q3 than they did in Q2, indicating sustained confidence among major institutional investors. 21Shares compiled data from Bloomberg and noticed that not only was Bitcoin ETF AUM from institutional investors rising, but so was the volume of institutional investors, which was behind the rapid ascent of Bitcoin ETF AUM this year. Separate research showed that Bitcoin ETFs collectively crossed over $100B in AUM, surpassing gold ETFs AUM as well. Exhibit A: Bitcoin ETFs surpassed gold-backed ETFs this year in terms of assets managed. (K33 Research) At the time of writing this note, the value of AUM in all spot Bitcoin ETFs totaled $112.6 billion. This is a remarkable feat these ETFs have been able to achieve, considering that 11 months ago most of these Bitcoin ETFs never existed. Exhibit B: Total Bitcoin ETF AUM trends through 2024 show growth stacked at the start and end of the year. (coinglass) Compared to all the Bitcoin ETFs, State Street’s SPDR Gold Trust (NYSEARCA: GLD ), the most popular gold ETF, has $73.3 billion in assets managed. Given that most gold ETFs, such as GLD, had a ~2-decade head start, the appreciation in AUMs by spot Bitcoin ETFs has marked a turning point in expandable appetite for Bitcoin ETFs. Leading the charge for Bitcoin ETFs is BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, which is now the largest Bitcoin ETF by assets managed. With ~$53 billion in assets, IBIT is the largest spot Bitcoin ETF available to investors, surpassing its predecessor, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust ETF (NYSEARCA: GBTC ). Via IBIT, BlackRock continues to offer investors a stable and relatively cheap alternative for investors to get exposure to Bitcoin. IBIT’s $53 billion in assets managed also means IBIT’s assets account for almost half of the total ~$112 billion spot Bitcoin ETF AUMs I mentioned earlier. Exhibit C: Top Bitcoin ETFs ranked versus BlackRock’s IBIT Bitcoin ETF, ordered by AUM (Author's compilation of top Bitcoin ETFs) Clearly, from Exhibit C, I note that IBIT is the largest spot Bitcoin ETF by AUM and still has comparative ETF fees of just 0.25%, which is within the range of its peer ETFs, barring Grayscale’s GBTC ETF on the high end and BTC ETF on the low end of the fee spectrum. As can also be seen from Exhibit C, the YTD returns for most ETFs, barring Grayscale’s ETFs, fall within the ~104% average returns for the year. All the ETFs that I mentioned above in Exhibit C do trade at a premium to their NAV, which might put off some investors as they wait for a better entry point. Still, for those investors who have a bullish outlook on the underlying asset, Bitcoin, these nuances of ETFs don't really matter. But for those who are looking to deploy more capital, IBIT appears to be trading at a much more affordable premium as compared to its peers, as seen in Exhibit D below. Exhibit D: BlackRock’s IBIT trades at a much more affordable premium to its NAV as compared to the other top spot Bitcoin ETFs. (yCharts) Per the chart above, IBIT is trading at a razor-thin discount to its NAV as compared to its peers, which trade at razor-thin premiums as compared to their NAV. But as I mentioned earlier, as long as investors maintain a bullish outlook on Bitcoin, these specifics really do not matter for the average investor. My 2025 Outlook On Bitcoin Is Still Positive I had noted in my previous note on IBIT how halvings tend to be eventually positive for the price discovery of Bitcoin, leading to higher prices for the digital asset. With this year’s halving in April complete, we are now on our way to the fifth halving, and Bitcoin’s price ascent so far still looks on par if I look at the previous price trends since their respective halvings. Exhibit E: Bitcoin still has enough room to continue its ascent higher and should follow the price trajectories of its previous Bitcoin halvings. (glassnode) As noted by the fifth epoch, or cycle, in black in the chart above, we should continue to experience a higher price trajectory in Bitcoin, and I anticipate that to happen through the course of 2025. Additionally, global liquidity cycles also should get better through 2025, which is a strong indicator for Bitcoin to continue performing through next year. The chart below does indicate some compression in liquidity, but I view that as seasonal, and I expect the reversal in liquidity through next year, which should keep the momentum in Bitcoin and other Bitcoin ETFs such as IBIT. Exhibit F: elevated levels of Global liquidity bodes well for Bitcoin’s prices. (bGeometrics) Risks & Other Factors To Consider As I noted in the previous section, liquidity cycles globally tend to compress around the end of the year and the start of the new year. But in my opinion, these cycles usually will pick up unless there is a recession or severe global event that causes headwinds for global liquidity. In such cases, as we witnessed in Q1 2022, Bitcoin will face pressure and severe volatility. Another marginal headwind investors should note here is that 2025 could see an entire new suite of crypto-focused ETF products being pushed into the market. Last month, option-related products for many spot Bitcoin ETFs, including IBIT, started trading on markets. These option products come after Ethereum-based ETFs were launched mid-year. Bitwise has also filed an S-1 to launch an ETF that offers exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum . There are more crypto products in the pipeline, which I expect will compete for crypto allocation of portfolio capital. This might put short-term pressure on Bitcoin. But, over the long term, these products harbor more opportunity for general crypto adoption, which is long-term positive for Bitcoin. Takeaway IBIT remains a strong ETF candidate for investors to allocate capital towards if they are interested in gaining or adding incremental exposure to Bitcoin via ETFs. The long-term indicators remain intact for Bitcoin to continue its ascent higher through 2025, and I expect ETFs such as IBIT to be beneficiaries of Bitcoin’s price ascent. The ETF also trades at a marginal discount to many of its ETF peers, which makes IBIT relatively attractive. I continue to recommend my Buy rating on IBIT.",IBIT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-12-28 10:07:26
