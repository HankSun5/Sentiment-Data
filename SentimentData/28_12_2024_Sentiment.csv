DOGEN Rejoys Big Moment: Trump‚Äôs Victory Will Send It to the Moon Guess who is going to join Elon Musk‚Äôs moon mission soon? DOGEN, the boldest meme coin for alpha males, is gearing up for take-off as Trump's victory in the recent US election has the entire market euphoric about the prospects of cryptocurrencies, especially meme coins. Donald and Elon are Best Buddies for Meme Coins Donald Trump‚Äôs love for crypto is no secret ‚Äî he‚Äôs promised to make the U.S. the global crypto leader in his campaign.

Flex Hard, Earn Big ‚Äì DOGEN is Your Power Move! Cardano's ADA: A Sustainable and Scalable Blockchain Platform Cardano is a flexible and scalable blockchain platform designed for smart contracts. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, competes with Ethereum's ETH. Users can store value, make payments, and stake on the Cardano network. Cardano uses the energy-efficient Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, unlike the energy-intensive proof-of-work model. It divides its blockchain into two layers: one for transactions and one for smart contracts. This enhances its ability to process up to a million transactions per second. Cardano tokens, introduced in March 2021, offer secure, low-fee interactions with smart contracts. This sets a new benchmark for blockchain efficiency and scalability. Given its technological advances and sustainable approach, ADA looks attractive in the current market cycle. Polkadot (DOT): Connecting Blockchains for a More Scalable Future Polkadot (DOT) is a decentralized protocol and cryptocurrency that enables secure communication between different blockchains. It allows value and data to be shared across blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin without intermediaries. Polkadot uses parachains to improve speed and scalability, processing more transactions than Bitcoin and Ethereum. The DOT token is used for governance and staking, letting holders participate in development and transaction verification. Developed by Gavin Wood, a co-founder of Ethereum, and launched on May 26, 2020, Polkadot aims to create more interconnected and efficient blockchains. In the current market cycle, Polkadot's technology and potential to enhance blockchain interoperability continue to draw interest. Conclusion In the current bull run, while ADA and DOT have less short-term potential, DOGEN offers massive growth. Designed for those seeking luxury and success, it expects 700% presale growth with potential thousand-fold returns. Following tokens like BONK, DOGEN builds a community of market leaders and offers real value through exclusive perks for early adopters.

The platform consists of three interoperable chains‚Äîthe X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain‚Äîthat handle various operations like transactions and smart contracts. AVAX is the native token of Avalanche, used for transaction fees, staking to secure the network, and operating customizable Subnets. The technology allows users to create their own tokens and blockchains. With its strong utility, high performance, and eco-friendly design, AVAX holds potential in the current market cycle. Solana's SOL: A High-Speed Platform for Decentralized Applications Solana is a blockchain platform designed for scalability and speed, offering a foundation for decentralized applications alongside competitors like Ethereum and Cardano. Its architecture enables faster transactions and flexible development across multiple programming languages. SOL, the native cryptocurrency of Solana, is central to its ecosystem, facilitating transactions, running custom programs, and rewarding network participants. The coin holds value by underpinning the operation of the Solana network, allowing users access to a suite of projects. Unlike some platforms, Solana avoids sharding or second-layer solutions, aiming to attract developers and investors with its high-capacity network capable of hosting high-activity products and services. In the current market cycle, Solana's technology continues to garner attention for its scalability and efficiency.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) , market capitalization‚Äôs second-largest meme coin, posted 3% losses in the last 24 hours as the selloff took a sharp turn. Other meme tokens have traded along similar lines, further plunging market sentiments. In the last 24 hours, whales have offloaded huge SHIB tokens, pushing the asset further into the red zone. Crypto analytics firm Lookonchain flagged a huge sale activity. A crypto whale sold 250 billion SHIB tokens worth approximately $6 million, aiming to take profits before further damage. The trader‚Äôs SHIB portfolio stands in profit after scooping 15.28 trillion SHIB for $3.8K in August 2020. From that point, the meme coin‚Äôs price has soared following bull cycles and mass accumulations from the community. The whale holds $52 million worth of assets after raking in $109 million in profits. This transaction follows previous trends from other whales dumping the asset. On Dec 16, 43 billion tokens were transferred to an unknown wallet, raising community reactions. Meme coins are susceptible to high swings because of prices and market structure. Rally After The Storm Amid a downtrend, meme coins can spark a frenzy on a wider crypto bulk cycle. SHIB bulls remain optimistic for an uphill run, which U.S. institutional investors will likely spark . Before the dip, the asset soared above 90% since the United States elections. Market bulls poured funds into meme coins in expectation of easing regulations in the country, a catalyst to drive the next upward momentum. Similarly, institutional investors also moved assets to reposition ahead of next year‚Äôs projections. Crypto enthusiasts investinghaven explained the possibility of a turnaround on X (formerly Twitter). ‚Äú$ SHIB: 2025 Price Outlook This chart shows Shiba Inu‚Äôs price could peak near $0.0000998 in 2025, while the potential low is at $0.0000234. The path to these targets may see volatility, but it reflects broader crypto market trends. Patience could pay off for #SHIB.‚Äù Another factor that could spur increased accumulation is the altcoin season . This is characterized by fund flows from Bitcoin to other assets in a cycle. Several analysts have tipped an incoming altcoin season this month as whales move assets to other assets. However, volatility remains a key factor, with recent outflows and dwindling sentiments.",Cryptocurrency|News|SHIB|SHIBA INU,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-27 22:09:15

Focusing on Ripple could be a concerning precedent for future digital asset regulations in the U.S. This battle between the US Securities and Exchange Commission and Ripple Labs is so important in the crypto world that many are concerned with the regulations by the U.S. government toward its digital assets. SEC‚Äôs focus on Ripple while overlooking bigger issues Fox Business Reporter Charles Gasparino was critical of other high-profile cases with Sam Bankman-Fried, but the SEC‚Äôs action against Ripple and its native cryptocurrency, XRP, got attention. Gasparino argues that the SEC is focusing on Ripple, which may be irrelevant, especially since bigger fish (Sam Bankman) are floating in the finance world. This case has gone far beyond Ripple and is bound to rewrite how the U.S. will continue to regulate its cryptocurrencies from now on. In an interview he said, Ripple Labs and Chief Executive Officer Brad Garlinghouse feel the SEC went too far. They consider the case filed in December 2020 not only an attack on Ripple but also on the cryptocurrency industry at large. Garlinghouse has also voiced his criticism of the SEC, arguing that the case will be a bad precedent for the entire industry. He further argued that the SEC does not know how to regulate cryptocurrency and that it does not appreciate the distinction between digital assets and others. Ripple vs. SEC Ripple reportedly stated its frustration at the SEC‚Äôs failure to provide clear guidance on what a company operating in the space of cryptocurrencies and related companies should do in the regulations. Ripple partially won in the court judgment made in 2023 since it ruled that XRP sold on secondary markets cannot be considered a security. The judgment separates XRP from other traditional securities transactions and brings great victory to Ripple. However, the court held that XRP‚Äôs direct sales to institutional investors are securities transactions, further pointing to the complexity of the case and the differing nature in which XRP is applied in different contexts. There is an argument that digital assets like XRP must be treated exactly the same way as the real securities inside, with general grounds that protect investors from fraud. Gary Gensler is the SEC chair then. Mr. Gensler maintains that the crypto marketplace should follow securities laws. To him, XRP, among others, has a duty to comply with securities laws for the protection of investors. In fact, the statements released by the company in 2021 have Gensler referring to Bitcoin and Ethereum as commodities but many other tokens and cryptocurrencies as likely being securities and therefore subject to the regulations. According to the SEC, Ripple sales of XRP should be considered securities, whether these are institutional or retail sales, and therefore fall within the same rules of sales that apply to stock and bonds. This being the case, the greater conversation is about how the US government should regulate cryptocurrency. Critics have pointed out the aggressive stance that the SEC has taken towards Ripple.

Ethereum: A Leading Proof-of-Stake Blockchain with Growing Potential Ethereum is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain known for smart contracts and a wide range of decentralized applications. It supports decentralized finance and uses Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon to improve transaction efficiency. Ethereum introduced ERC-20 tokens, which are used across various applications, but transactions still require ETH for gas fees. Since its launch in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum has evolved, transitioning to Proof-of-Stake with the Merge in 2022. The upcoming sharding phase aims to enhance scalability and reduce costs. Ether (ETH) remains central, facilitating transactions and rewarding stakers. Based on historical price movements and BTC halving cycles, Ethereum's price predictions suggest potential growth. These developments may make Ethereum attractive in the current market cycle. XRP: A Fast, Low-Cost Cryptocurrency for Global Transactions XRP is a cryptocurrency that operates on the XRP Ledger. It is designed to be fast, low-cost, and open. XRP allows for borderless transactions that are resistant to censorship and counterfeiting. It does not rely on a central authority, making transactions secure and irreversible. XRP was created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz. They launched it with a supply of 100 billion tokens. Ripple received 80 billion XRP to improve network liquidity and support the ecosystem. Ripple uses XRP to facilitate quick and efficient transfers across different currencies. In the current market cycle, XRP's technology and potential applications may make it an interesting option for global payments. Conclusion As the bull run unfolds, traditional coins like ETH and XRP show less short-term potential. Investors are shifting to DOGEN, a meme token for those seeking luxury and success. Expected to grow 700% by the presale's end with potential for massive returns, DOGEN builds a community of leaders and offers real benefits to early adopters.

The decision to extradite Kwon to the US rather than his native South Korea comes after Montenegro‚Äôs Constitutional Court dismissed the disgraced Terra founder‚Äôs appeal. Do Kwon To Face Trial In the US One of the most notorious figures in the crypto industry is set to be deported to the United States. The Montenegrin Minister of Justice, Bojan Bo≈æoviƒá, has approved the extradition of bombastic South Korean entrepreneur Do Kwon, the Ministry announced on Friday. ‚ÄúIt was concluded that most of the criteria provided by law support the request for extradition by the competent authorities of the United States of America,‚Äù a translated statement from Bo≈æoviƒá reportedly said, according to news publication Vijesti . This follows a decision from the Constitutional Court of Montenegro earlier this week, which rejected Kwon‚Äôs appeal against a previous Supreme Court ruling. In September, the Supreme Court nullified Kwon‚Äôs deportation to South Korea and indicated that the Balkan nation‚Äôs Minister of Justice would make the final extradition decision. Extradition Nightmare Kwon founded Terraform Labs, popularly known for its algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD (UST) and its sister token LUNA. Both assets imploded in May 2022, wiping out over $40 billion in investor wealth overnight and triggering a chain of bankruptcies throughout the cryptosphere, before its founder went on a run from law enforcement around the world. He was arrested in March 2023 in Montenegro while attempting to travel to Dubai using a fake passport. Since being released from jail this March, Kwon has faced lengthy legal proceedings , with courts deciding between dueling demands to send him to the US or South Korea. The US has been particularly vocal in pursuing his extradition as it seeks to hold him accountable for his role in the shambolic collapse of the Terra ecosystem. Notably, in June, a New York jury found Terraform Labs and Kwon liable for fraud in a lawsuit brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The verdict included six charges, including intentionally misleading investors, misrepresentations about the success and stability of Terra, and ‚Äúreckless‚Äù mishandling of customer money. In June, the controversial company and its once-fugitive founder were fined a whopping $4.5 billion by the SEC after reaching a ‚Äúsettlement in principle‚Äù. While it‚Äôs not the outcome Kwon was hoping for, signing the order to have him transferred to the United States should hopefully conclude the multi-year legal battle.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News|Terra|USA,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|LUNA|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-27 22:14:39

However, in the last month, the price has decreased by 19.60%, including an 8.97% drop in the past week. Currently, SOL is trading between $160.72 and $214.47, reflecting significant volatility. Technical indicators point to potential market trends. SOL is below both its 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages at $189.09 and $190.79, respectively. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 33.48, and the Stochastic oscillator is at 16.54, both suggesting the asset is nearing oversold conditions. The MACD level of -2.081 indicates bearish momentum may continue. Key support and resistance levels are crucial for SOL's price movement. The nearest support level is at $141.08; if the price falls below this, it could test the second support at $87.33. On the upside, breaking through the nearest resistance at $248.58 may propel the price toward the second resistance level of $302. This would represent a substantial percentage gain from current levels. Based on this data, SOL's price could rise if it surpasses resistance levels or fall further if it breaks below support levels. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum (ETH) has experienced notable price movements recently. Over the past week, its price dropped by 8.42%, bringing it within the current range of $2881.83 to $3892.12. The monthly change shows a smaller decline of 2.61%, and over the past six months, ETH has decreased by 1.57%. Technical indicators suggest potential shifts in ETH's price. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 26.14, indicating that the asset is oversold. The Stochastic value is 12.83, supporting this oversold status. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level stands at -33.83, which could signal a forthcoming change in momentum. Both the 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are close, at $3355.12 and $3400.11 respectively, hinting at a consolidation phase. Looking ahead, if ETH manages to surpass the nearest resistance level at $4504, it could aim for the second resistance at $5515, offering potential gains of over 15% and 40% respectively from current levels. Conversely, if it falls below the nearest support at $2483.85, the next support level is at $1473.56, which would represent a significant decrease. Traders are watching these key levels closely, as they may indicate substantial price movements in the near future. Kaspa (KAS) Kaspa (KAS) has been experiencing a noticeable decline in its price recently. Over the past week, the coin's value has dropped by approximately 10.7%. Looking at the monthly performance, it has decreased by about 23.9%. In the last six months, Kaspa has seen a significant reduction of around 36.5% in its price. Currently, KAS is trading in the range of $0.10 to $0.15, indicating a downward trend. The coin is approaching its nearest support level at $0.08. If the price dips below this point, the next support is at $0.0342, which could imply a further decline. On the upside, the immediate resistance level is at $0.18. Surpassing this could lead Kaspa toward the second resistance at $0.22, representing a potential increase of over 45% from its current lower range. Technical indicators suggest mixed signals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is around 30.8, and the Stochastic oscillator is approximately 10.6, both indicating that Kaspa may be entering oversold territory. The Simple Moving Averages for both 10 and 100 days are at $0.12, showing that the price is consolidating around this point. However, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level is negative at -0.001554, hinting at bearish momentum. Based on these factors, Kaspa's price could either continue to decline or potentially rebound if buying interest increases. Conclusion Though SOL, ETH, and KAS are promising, XYZVerse (XYZ), the pioneering all-sport memecoin, offers early adopters growth potential, blending sports enthusiasm with meme culture for significant gains.

This will usher in new growth, with surging adoption tapping an all-time high. Recent activities in the bull cycle have led to uphill projections, although price corrections threaten momentum. In a new document, Saylor rolled out a taxonomy and proposed rights and responsibilities for participants in the crypto space. Notably, this boils down to ramping up activity in the United States and becoming a leader in space. In the run-up to November polls, President-elect Donald Trump restated his stance on the U.S. becoming a global leader in blockchain, Bitcoin, and artificial intelligence. A New All-Time Market Cap? According to the document, US participation in the crypto market will strengthen its position and lead to fresh capital inflow. Specifically, the total digital capital market is estimated to soar from $2 trillion to $280 trillion, with US investors dominating the scene. Saylor asserted that this would strengthen the dollar and reduce the national debt. Following Donald Trump‚Äôs win, institutional investors recorded massive inflows, taking the market cap above $3 trillion. This pushed the price of Bitcoin above $90K and eventually tapped $107K as buying intensified. Although the market faced slight sell pressures, traders looked to pro-market regulations as Republicans control both houses of Congress. Inflows are expected to drive global adoption, taking the market cap to an all-time high. The main instrument for the upswing is a Bitcoin strategic reserve. Tipped by most stakeholders, it is expected to attract bulls and help the county lower its debt. US Senator Cynthia Lummis proposed a bill that will see the country acquire 1 million BTC per year to be held for at least 20 years. Lummis proposes selling gold reserves to fund Bitcoin purchases. Saylor also noted that digital asset growth without Bitcoin is expected to notch inflows. A Path To Clear Rules Although sentiments have largely flipped positive following the advancement of pro-crypto bills, much effort is still required to bring the US into line with other jurisdictions. Per the document, Saylor seeks a clear framework for issuers, owners, and crypto exchanges to avoid the plethora of lawsuits previously recorded. ‚Äú Path to Legitimacy: Establish a global, real-time, and uninterrupted process for issuing, trading, and owning digital assets by individuals, corporations, and machines. Issuers: Rights: The right to create and issue digital assets. Responsibilities: Ensure fair disclosure and ethical behavior. Exchanges: Rights: The right to custody, trade, and transfer assets between clients and other exchanges. Responsibilities: Publish asset disclosures, protect client assets, and avoid conflicts of interest,‚Äù the document reads.",Cryptocurrency|Featured|News|Michael Saylor|MicroStrategy,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-27 22:19:29

Solana (SOL) SOL has seen notable price movements recently. Over the past six months, it has risen by 34.50%. However, in the last month, the price has decreased by 19.60%, including an 8.97% drop in the past week. Currently, SOL is trading between $160.72 and $214.47, reflecting significant volatility. Technical indicators point to potential market trends. SOL is below both its 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages at $189.09 and $190.79, respectively. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 33.48, and the Stochastic oscillator is at 16.54, both suggesting the asset is nearing oversold conditions. The MACD level of -2.081 indicates bearish momentum may continue. Key support and resistance levels are crucial for SOL's price movement. The nearest support level is at $141.08; if the price falls below this, it could test the second support at $87.33. On the upside, breaking through the nearest resistance at $248.58 may propel the price toward the second resistance level of $302. This would represent a substantial percentage gain from current levels. Based on this data, SOL's price could rise if it surpasses resistance levels or fall further if it breaks below support levels. Dogecoin (DOGE) Over the past week, Dogecoin has fallen by 12.79%, extending a month-long drop of 20.41%. Despite this downward trend, the meme-based cryptocurrency boasts a six-month gain of 153.49%. This contrast highlights its volatile nature, offering significant returns over the long term even amid short-term losses. Technical indicators suggest Dogecoin might be oversold. The Relative Strength Index is at 28.36, and the Stochastic oscillator stands at 16.03‚Äîboth below typical oversold thresholds. Additionally, the 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are converging at $0.32, indicating potential price stabilization or a reversal. Looking ahead, Dogecoin faces resistance at $0.48 and stronger resistance at $0.63. Breaking through these levels could signal substantial upside, potentially leading to double-digit percentage gains. On the downside, support lies at $0.18, with a deeper support level at $0.0257. If prices slip below these points, further declines may follow. Traders are watching these key levels to gauge Dogecoin's next move. Conclusion With SOL, DOGE, and the innovative XYZVerse uniting sports fans and meme culture, these coins are poised to lead the crypto market's surge into 2025.

Buterin‚Äôs Christmas gift will go toward upgrading the zoo‚Äôs facilities and supporting its Wildlife Sponsorship program. Crypto Meets Conservation In a letter addressed to Khao Kheow‚Äôs director shared on X, the Russian-born programmer explained that his involvement stemmed from a recent visit to the facility, where he was captivated by its commitment to animal welfare and community engagement. He thanked the zoo for welcoming him and highlighted Moo Deng‚Äôs unique role as a cultural ambassador for Thailand. Buterin praised the animal sanctuary‚Äôs efforts and reiterated the importance of improving the pygmy hippo habitat. He also acknowledged Thailand‚Äôs hospitality to the Ethereum community, especially during Devcon SEA in Bangkok last November. The 30-year-old said he would donate no less than 10 million baht, approximately $300,000 in Moo Deng‚Äôs name, to be delivered in two installments. The first contribution was made on December 26, with the date for the second set to be communicated later. Buterin has also promised an extra 88 ETH to ensure ongoing support for the zoo‚Äôs projects. Earlier, the establishment had posted on X expressing its appreciation for the Ethereum developer‚Äôs generosity, calling him ‚Äúan adoptive father to Moo Deng.‚Äù He responded, sharing his enthusiasm for the role and quoting a popular line from the Star Trek shows: ‚ÄúMay they live long and prosper.‚Äù Market Performance Moo Deng, already a beloved symbol in Thailand, gained global fame as the face of the MOODENG coin. The token has captured the crypto community‚Äôs attention despite recent market fluctuations. At the time of this writing, it was changing hands at $0.2693, with a 24-hour trading volume of $179.7 million, representing a 50.3% surge in activity compared to the previous day. While the token‚Äôs price dipped 3.2% in the past 24 hours, it gained 6.1% over the past week, outperforming the broader crypto market, which had seen a 1.2% decline in that period. Buterin previously liquidated over $1 million worth of meme tokens donated to him, including 10 billion MOODENG, giving the proceeds to various charities. Interestingly, he was recently critical of the meme coin space, decrying the proliferation of celebrity-inspired tokens. He argued that it would be better if they had a public goal aimed at promoting a specific cause or at least incorporated fun mechanics going beyond trading.

38202219,https://invezz.com/?p=2407689,1735338403,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Pig butchering crypto scams cost users $3.6 billion this year,https://invezz.com/news/2024/12/27/pig-butchering-crypto-scams-cost-users-3-6-billion-this-year/,"Pig butchering scams were the leading attack vector for the cryptocurrency space in 2024, resulting in multi-billion dollar losses for millions of investors. According to data from web3 security firm Cyver‚Äôs annual fraud report, scammers managed to dupe crypto users out of a whopping $3.6 billion this year, with the attacks spanning over 150,000 addresses and 800,000 transactions. The number, while significant, presents a slight drop in losses compared to the previous year, when roughly $3.96 billion was lost to similar schemes. What are pig butchering scams? Often involving sophisticated social engineering tactics, pig butchering scams are long-term fraud schemes that thrive on emotional manipulation, fake credibility, and the promise of high returns, making them one of the most insidious threats in the cryptocurrency space. The term ‚Äòpig butchering‚Äô has been derived from the practice of fattening a pig before slaughter, similar to how scammers build trust and rapport with their targets over weeks or even months. Fraudsters approach victims in various ways. Sometimes, they pose as romantic interests, sometimes as financial mentors, and gradually coax victims into fishy crypto investments that are too good to be true. Victims are usually led to fake trading platforms where they often see manipulated dashboards that display impressive returns to gain their trust and encourage investments. Once the victim is fully invested, the scammer disappears with the funds, leaving victims with little recourse and often no way to recover their losses. However, in a rare turn of events last month, the Federal Bureau of Investigation recovered $8.3 million connected to a pig butchering scheme. The case involved the former chief executive of Heartland Tri-State Bank, who misappropriated $47.1 million in customer funds, which ultimately led to the bank‚Äôs collapse. With pig butchering scams becoming increasingly common, authorities all across the globe have increased efforts to track and dismantle these often large criminal networks. Earlier this month, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission in Nigeria arrested 792 suspects allegedly involved in orchestrating pig butchering scams. Cyber attacks on the rise However, pig butchering scams are merely the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the various types of threats that plague the cryptocurrency industry. The Cyvers report notes that hacking attacks targeting the sector jumped 40% compared to last year, with access control breaches and smart contract vulnerabilities causing the most damage. As previously reported by Invezz, a separate report from security firm Hacken also highlights a similar trend. Notably, the centralized finance sector was the most affected, with private key compromises and weak access controls emerging as primary vulnerabilities, contributing to 75% of all exploits in 2024. Besides the aforementioned schemes, phishing attacks remain another persistent threat to crypto users. Since cryptocurrencies are inherently digital and transactions occur entirely online, the ecosystem remains highly vulnerable to such attacks. Even though such losses have been steadily declining over the past months, the complex and stealthy nature of the attack makes it a common weapon in the crypto scammer‚Äôs arsenal. For instance, on December 26, scammers were seen exploiting Google ads to distribute crypto-stealing phishing scripts while mimicking the Pugy Penguins project website with the malicious content hosted on the Adloox tracking domain.

Get in now, watch Catzilla wreck the market, and bring chaos to the competition! Shiba Inu (SHIB): Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Expanding Utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a memecoin inspired by Dogecoin but built on the Ethereum blockchain. Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi, SHIB started with a quadrillion tokens. Half of the tokens were sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin, who donated and burned large amounts, increasing SHIB's visibility. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB's Ethereum base allows for applications like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange. There are plans for a future NFT platform and a DAO-based governance system. This integration with Ethereum's ecosystem gives SHIB potential for broader utility. In the current market cycle, SHIB's developments may attract interest due to its expanding features. Conclusion Coins like SHIB may have less short-term potential, while Catzilla aims to bring financial freedom to everyone. Offering a 700% ROI potential during its presale, the token starts at $0.0002 and rises to $0.0016 over 14 stages.

After the holidays, the asset manager becomes one of the biggest Ethereum (ETH) whales after copping 993,591.95 ETH. This is equivalent to $3.5 billion worth of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. BlackRock Benefits from Spot Ethereum ETF BlackRock achieved this feat through its ETH Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) with the ticker ETHA. As of December 27, the firm‚Äôs Ethereum holding represents 0.12% of Ethereum‚Äôs total supply. Consequently, BlackRock has risen to become the world‚Äôs 12th-largest altcoin holder. This marks a laudable feat for a firm whose history with Ethereum began only this year. Contextually, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot Ethereum ETF applications made by eight firms, including BlackRock, in July 2024 after a long wait . Ethereum Price Struggles Post-ETF Approval Since the approval of the funds, Ethereum has had a good time in terms of growth. In addition, Donald Trump‚Äôs victory in the last United States elections held in November also contributed to the price rally. At this writing, Ethereum traded at $3,313.42 after losing 1% of its 24-hour price gain. The altcoin has been stuck between critical psychological levels in the last few weeks. According to crypto analyst Rekt Capital, it has struggled to break above the $4,000 mark . The coin passed this threshold in the past and peaked at $4,077 on December 6. There are speculations that Ethereum could slip further down to the point of losing up to 10% of its current price level. BlackRock IBIT Records Largest Outflow BlackRock‚Äôs Bitcoin ETF has also recorded a lot of success this past few weeks, although it hit a roadblock recently. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) recorded its biggest outflow just a day before Christmas. This coincided with when the United States spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded four straight days of withdrawals, with over $1.5 billion missing. On Wednesday, IBIT made headlines because of a large outflow of $188.7 million . This was the largest that the fund had seen since its inception. In the coming weeks, which coincides with Donald Trump‚Äôs entry into office, the outlook of these funds may improve.

Related Reading: Dogecoin 600% Rally Prediction Still On Track Before End Of 2024 ‚Äî Analyst According to recent studies, historical price fluctuations show that the popular meme coin may experience another parabolic boom. Dogecoin has been notorious for its wild price swings, and many predict that the coming year will be critical to its progress. Historical Patterns Suggest Potential Gains Dogecoin has had a history of sharp price increases followed by declines. For instance, in 2017 it rose 210% prior to reversing, then suddenly jumped 5,000%. In 2021, it followed a pattern, initially rising 476% before a significant reversal that ended with an astonishing increase of 12,000%. Dogecoin is now up around 440% over the last year, but has lately had a 46% pullback. Analysts believe that this repeated pattern implies a potential significant rally. Dogecoin Bullish Forecasts For 2025 Many analysts have made quite optimistic projections on the course Dogecoin‚Äôs price might take over 2025. While some have ranged within $1 and $3, others have pegged it as high as $10. Investments CEO said in a post on Christmas Day that Dogecoin would repeat its fourth-year cyclical performance. At the same time, he said that the meme coin‚Äôs rise would be better compared to that of 2021. A MASSIVE rally is coming for $DOGE, MUCH bigger than the one in 2021. Are you prepared? pic.twitter.com/auBAw7XMMn ‚Äî CEO (@Investments_CEO) December 25, 2024 Meanwhile, some likely involvement from Elon Musk may be another crucial point, who is probably going to have a key role to play in the meme coin community sometime in the next year. His influence will probably create just the ideal atmosphere for Dogecoin to reach new highs. According to analyst Javon Marks, Dogecoin may surge as high as 600%, reaching approximately $2.28 based on past trends and market behavior. He says that previous cycles have followed similar patterns, leading to huge price increases. Market Sentiment And Future Outlook Despite recent volatility in the market and some bearish pressures, analysts still believe in Dogecoin‚Äôs bright future. The cryptocurrency market has recently been very volatile, and yet most of the analysts still predict that when bitcoin will stabilize and start surging again, Dogecoin will be sure to do the same. More than 140% gain of the Dogecoin‚Äôs price, taking the currency above $0.8023 is predicted once bitcoin reverses its down move.

Cardano, which has a market capitalization of $31.4 billion, and Ripple‚Äôs XRP, with a market capitalization of $123 billion, could be planning to enter into a symbiotic relationship. Cardano‚Äôs founder, Charles Hoskinson , has aroused discussions about adding XRP to Cardano‚Äôs privacy-focused Midnight sidechain. XRP in Cardano‚Äôs Midnight? Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, has hinted at the likelihood of partnering with Ripple. He suggested that the Midnight sidechain focused on privacy could include XRP in the project. The discussion also covered Ripple‚Äôs RLUSD stablecoin as a potential addition to Cardano‚Äôs ecosystem. Hoskinson also mentioned that he had been holding talks with Ripple CTO David Schwartz as well as the company‚Äôs CEO Brad Garlinghouse. ‚ÄúDave Schwartz is a great guy. He‚Äôs a brilliant guy. It‚Äôs a lot of fun being in meetings with him, and I love to hang out with him,‚Äù Hoskinson stated. Ripple‚Äôs resilience amid its legal battles with the U.S. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) impressed Hoskinson. The court case between Ripple and the SEC started in December 2020. Through XRP, the SEC alleged that Ripple sold securities without receiving prior approval. In July of 2023, the federal court ruled that XRP is not a security when traded in public platforms, among other things. However, unfavorable penalties and appeal proceedings continue to exert regulatory pressure on Ripple. In a recent live stream , Hoskinson even boasted about how well the company is run to deal with lawsuits, delistings, and regulation. Despite setbacks, Ripple remains a key player in the crypto space. Hoskinson also discussed using XRP in Midnight. This sidechain is built to focus on privacy within decentralized applications. He also mentioned that Ripple‚Äôs RLUSD stablecoin could work in many ways for Cardano‚Äôs ecosystem. Hoskinson‚Äôs Budding Relationship with Ripple The Cardano founder‚Äôs comments show a shift in his stance toward Ripple. He previously publicly apologized to the XRP community on November 10. Collaboration talks suggest Ripple and Cardano may align on privacy and smart contract innovations. Ripple remains a top crypto player. XRP is the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, with a $31.4 billion market cap as of Dec. 27 (CoinMarketCap). Despite legal challenges, Ripple continues to push forward with new initiatives. The discussions signal a potential alliance between Ripple and Cardano . This could create new opportunities in blockchain privacy and stablecoin integration if realized. Both sides remain in talks as they navigate the evolving crypto landscape.",Cryptocurrency|Featured|News|ADA|Cardano|Charles Hoskinson|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,ADA|MARKET|REGULATION|SPONSORED|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-27 22:34:38

Ethena (ENA) Eyes Breakout as Altcoin Season Approaches Ethena (ENA) is showing promising signs amid growing optimism for an upcoming altcoin season. Despite a recent dip of -12.95% over the past week, ENA has surged 48.75% in the last month and an impressive 83.34% over six months. The RSI stands at 28.24, indicating oversold conditions, while the stochastic at 6.97 suggests potential upward momentum. With the current price hovering between $0.81 and $1.29, breaking above the nearest resistance at $1.55 could open the path to the second resistance at $2.04. This move could represent a significant gain from current levels. The SMA for 10-days is below the 100-days SMA, hinting at a possible trend reversal. ENA might be poised for substantial growth. Movement (MOVE) Soars: Nearly 1000% Monthly Gain Signals Bullish Momentum Movement (MOVE) has soared nearly 1000% in the past month, showcasing strong bullish momentum. This week alone, the price surged over 72%. Trading between $0.57 and $1.11, MOVE is approaching its nearest resistance at $1.39. A break above this level could see it targeting $1.93, offering significant gains. The Relative Strength Index sits at 43, suggesting there's room for growth before hitting overbought levels. The Stochastic oscillator indicates oversold conditions, hinting at a potential price rebound. With the 100-day Simple Moving Average at $0.94, Movement appears poised for continued growth in the upcoming altcoin season. Conclusion SHIRO, ENA, and MOVE show promise but may have less short-term potential. Catzilla, the ultimate meme coin hero, offers a 700% ROI potential during its presale.

Emerging blockchain platforms are poised to revolutionize the market by the year 2025. This article explores the innovative technologies that are expected to drive the next significant surge in digital currencies. Delve into the developments that could reshape the future of crypto and potentially transform the global financial system. Graphite Token (@G): Powering the Blockchain That Could Topple Ethereum and Solana Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) have had their time in the spotlight. Now, Graphite Token (@G) is here, bringing with it the power of the Graphite L1 blockchain designed to make crypto simpler, faster, and more rewarding for everyone. Could this be the next big thing to follow Ethereum‚Äôs legendary 4,000X growth? The secret to life-changing crypto profits lies in spotting the next hidden gem before the crowd. History shows that early adopters of projects with real utility reap massive rewards: Solana started at $0.04 and skyrocketed to nearly $300 ‚Äî a staggering +7,500%. Ethereum launched below $1 and climbed to around $4,000 ‚Äî an insane +400,000%. The secret to their growth? Utility. The more people use them, the more valuable their tokens become. But times have changed, and these blockchains aren‚Äôt cutting it anymore. Discover SOL and ETH Challenger for 4,000X Profit Potential What‚Äôs Wrong with Ethereum and Solana? Older blockchains face growing challenges like rising fees, complexity, regulatory uncertainty, and questions about reliability. Take Solana, which occasionally experiences network outages, or Ethereum, which saw a significant reduction in its burn rate in 2024. Between unpredictable gas costs, unsatisfactory speed, and unreliable service, users are starting to look elsewhere. The dominance of the ‚Äúold guard‚Äù is fading. What Graphite Brings to the Table Graphite is built to address the challenges of older blockchains with a set of practical features. Direct Rewards for Entry-Point Nodes Graphite has something no other blockchain offers. It lets entry-point nodes earn 50% of transaction fees passing through their nodes, so literally anyone contributing to its operations can earn a share. Transparent, Trust-Based Interactions Graphite‚Äôs reputation-based system introduces a Trust Score, a measure of user credibility similar to a credit rating in TradFi. This approach enhances transparency while keeping user privacy within the network where interactions are built on trust. Fair Fees, Fast Speed, and High Scalability Powered by the PoA Polymer 2.0 Algorithm, Graphite keeps fees plain and as low as possible by minimizing computational and energy costs. The network processes up to 1,400 transactions per second with confirmation times under 10 seconds, delivering a perfect balance of speed, cost-efficiency, and reliability. Security as a Top Priority Graphite enforces a one user - one account policy to safeguard its network against fraud and scams. Additionally, it offers an optional KYC verification procedure with three tiers of off-chain checks powered by ZKP to ensure compliance while protecting user data. With transaction filters, users can choose to interact only with accounts that meet specific KYC levels, adding an extra layer of security. Is This Your Chance to Get in Early? The Graphite blockchain is secure, transparent, scalable, and cost-efficient, making it the go-to choice for developers and users alike. With its practical approach and early adoption potential, Graphite is a project worth watching. For those looking to get in early, Graphite offers an opportunity to be part of a blockchain that‚Äôs designed for long-term growth and usability. Will it deliver 4,000X gains? Time will tell, but the foundation is strong. This could be your shot at 4,000X profits ‚Äî Don‚Äôt miss out! ARB Token: Empowering Ethereum with Arbitrum's Layer-2 Scaling ARB is the token powering Arbitrum, a Layer-2 solution for Ethereum developed by Offchain Labs. Arbitrum enhances Ethereum by increasing transaction speed, scalability, and privacy. It uses optimistic rollups to improve smart contract performance and lower execution costs. ARB serves as a governance token, allowing holders to vote on network decisions and participate in ecosystem development. The initial supply is 10 billion tokens, with a maximum yearly inflation rate of 2%. Distribution includes allocations to investors, DAOs, individual wallets, a DAO Treasury, and the team and advisors. The Arbitrum DAO oversees any changes in token allocation. Solana (SOL): Exploring a Scalable Blockchain for Decentralized Apps Solana is a blockchain platform that focuses on scalability. It provides a foundation for decentralized applications, similar to Ethereum and Cardano. Solana stands out because of its architecture designed for fast transactions and flexible development across many programming languages. SOL is the native cryptocurrency of Solana. It plays a central role in the ecosystem. Users can use SOL to facilitate transactions, run custom programs, and reward network supporters. The SOL coin holds value because it underpins the operation of the Solana ecosystem. It rewards participants and allows access to various projects. Solana avoids sharding or second-layer solutions for scalability. Its high-capacity network aims to attract developers and investors by hosting high-activity products and services. AVAX: Avalanche's Eco-Friendly Blockchain with High Transaction Capacity AVAX is the native token of Avalanche, a Layer-1 blockchain known for its low fees and quick transaction processing. The platform uses a hybrid consensus mechanism that combines classical and Nakamoto principles, aiming to finalize transactions in less than two seconds. Avalanche features three interoperable chains‚Äîthe X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain‚Äîthat handle various functions like transactions and smart contracts. AVAX plays a central role in the ecosystem, used for transaction fees, securing the network through staking, and operating multiple Subnets. This utility supports payments, staking rewards, and the creation of custom tokens and blockchains within the network. Conclusion In conclusion, while coins like ARB, SOL, and AVAX show promise, they may have less potential in the short term. The Graphite Token (@G) powers the innovative Graphite L1 blockchain, aiming to simplify crypto and deliver unmatched speed and rewards. It tackles issues like Ethereum's high fees and Solana's network outages by offering fair transaction costs and a Trust Score system based on reputation. A unique reward model allows entry-point nodes to earn 50% of transaction fees, encouraging active participation. With strong security through Polymer 2.0 and optional KYC verification, Graphite sets new standards for blockchain reliability. For early adopters, it presents an exciting opportunity to engage with a project built for long-term growth. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

Winter Pepe (PEPEWINT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEWINT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Winter Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Winter Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Winter Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Winter Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Winter Pepe by entering its contract address ‚Äì CUreLFB9SJmu6WEpotjmLJgt1khhdpneukDRJsbXFCGM ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner.

In its 2024 Web3 Security Report, Hacken says that the theft of private crypto keys remains the most ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù threat to crypto investors. According to Hacken, the number of smart contract exploits pale in comparison to how often private crypto keys are stolen. ‚ÄúIn 2024, access control exploits ‚Äì closely tied to private key compromises ‚Äì accounted for nearly of total crypto hack losses, up from 50% in 2023. This translates to nearly lost across Web3, a sharp increase from less than $1 billion the previous year. 75% $1.7 billion In comparison, smart contract vulnerability exploits contributed just 14% of the total losses in 2024, underscoring the dominant threat posed by unauthorized access and private key theft.‚Äù Private keys are strings of letters, words, and numbers generated by crypto wallets used to authorize transactions and prove ownership. They help encrypt data and assets to protect them from being stolen. The cybersecurity firm goes on to note four reasons why people tend to get their private keys stolen ‚Äì using an insecure management platform, being tricked by social engineering campaigns, insecure backups of data, and vulnerabilities within single-signature schemes of crypto wallets. According to Hacken, the largest exploit of 2024 was the hack of centralized Indian crypto exchange WazirX, which saw over $230 million worth of digital assets stolen. ‚ÄúDespite employing a robust multiparty security system, the exchange suffered a breach due to unauthorized fund movements from their wallets. WazirX utilized a Gnosis Safe multisig wallet requiring 4 out of 6 signatures for transactions. Five of the keys were managed by WazirX, while the sixth was held by Liminal, a digital asset custody provider. The attacker managed to manipulate the system, obtaining signatures from three WazirX signers and one from Liminal, allowing them to upgrade the wallet to a malicious contract and siphon off the funds.‚Äù Don't Miss a Beat ‚Äì Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Egrar Crypto, a technical analyst whose X account is followed by nearly 70,000 fans people, emphasized that Ripple could deliver much higher gains than Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH) during this stage of the bull market. #XRP ‚Äì Will Outperform #ETH and #BTC ‚Äì The Secret Is Under the Hood! #XRP Market Cap Window = $619.61B ‚Äì $1.56T Ready How and Why. This post focuses on XRP's Dominance and its Market Cap potential, revealing why it has a much higher multiplier than both ETH and BTC.‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/7CbaGlPxjr ‚Äî EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 25, 2024 He first shared an assessment of how XRP‚Äôs dominance has been evolving lately, moving from as little as 1% to over 5% in the past four years, primarily as a result of the legal victory that Ripple had in its case against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). He went on to predict that a break above the 0.5 Fibonacci level ‚Äì typically interpreted as a bullish signal ‚Äì could propel XRP‚Äôs dominance to 11.44%. Given that the combined value of cryptocurrencies currently stands at $3.28 trillion, that would mean XRP‚Äôs market value could be propelled to $375 million on short notice if that scenario unfolds as Egrar Crypto expects. This would result in 3X gains for XRP holders based on the token‚Äôs current market cap. However, Egrar predicts that the total market cap of cryptos could surge to $5.42 trillion once alt-coin season starts, meaning that reaching the 11.44% dominance level would mean a total market cap of $620 billion or 5X gains for XRP investors. Although past performance is not a guarantee of future outcomes, the trend for XRP dominance is currently on an upward path. If its ascent continues, these are plausible targets that could be reached in the medium term. XRP at $4 Before Year End is a Real Possibility From a technical standpoint, the $4 area is a feasible target that XRP could reach once the market shakes off the latest pullback and late buyers enter the scene to add more fuel to the rally. The post-election uptick that the crypto market experienced is interpreted by analysts as the first wave in what could be a prolonged climb for digital assets as multiple tailwinds including Donald Trump‚Äôs victory in the November U.S. presidential election and the Federal Reserve‚Äôs commitment to keep lowering rates are favoring higher prices for risky assets like cryptos. XRP has been the most favored asset of this rally of all the top 10 cryptocurrencies as it experienced a 253% uptick since a court of law ruled in favor of the company in its long-standing legal rift against the SEC. The robustness of the XRP network and the active involvement of its C-level officers along with a strong community of die-hard backers who have accompanied the project despite the many challenges it has faced could make XRP become a powerhouse in the cross-border payments, decentralized finance (DeFi) , and smart contracts segments. The launch of the stablecoin RLUSD is a step forward for the project to keep expanding its reach. During the latest pullback, XRP has found support at around $1.95 per token. This is the most critical area to watch moving forward. As long as it holds, it could serve as a launching pad once alt-season kicks in. The short-term target of $4 seems attainable and this would result in XRP doubling its market cap. However, the target shared by Egrar Crypto provides a longer-term view of the potential of this cryptocurrency to keep expanding its footprint in the crypto market.

This widespread dip in altcoin prices is largely tied to Bitcoin's dominance (BTC.D), which currently sits at a high 58.1%. What is BTC.D and Why Does It Matter? Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) is the percentage of the total cryptocurrency market made up by Bitcoin. When BTC.D is high, it means most of the money in the market is flowing into Bitcoin rather than altcoins. This often happens during times of uncertainty, as investors see Bitcoin as a safer bet compared to smaller coins.For altcoins to thrive, BTC.D needs to go down. A lower BTC.D signals that investors are moving funds into smaller altcoins, which drives their prices up. Historically, BTC.D starts to drop in the first quarter of a new year. When this happens, it usually kicks off an ""altcoin season,"" where altcoins grow much faster than Bitcoin.That means altcoins such as $WIF, $BONK, $ETH, $SOL, and $SHIB will likely start moving to the upside significantly. However, to maximize gains, it‚Äôs essential to pick the highest winners. Among the most promising winners for the upcoming altcoin season, experts highlight Altura ($ALU) as a standout project. Why Altura ($ALU) Could Be the Star of Altcoin Season One of the most exciting projects to watch during the next altcoin season is Altura($ALU). Altura is an AI-driven cryptocurrency that‚Äôs focused on revolutionizing the NFT and gaming world. By using artificial intelligence, Altura offers cutting-edge solutions that are catching the attention of both crypto and tech enthusiasts.Currently, Altura is only at a $100 million market cap, making it an undervalued gem. A 10x growth would mean reaching just a $1 billion market cap, which is considered achievable given the rapid growth of the AI and gaming industries. These industries are expanding at an incredible pace, and Altura‚Äôs unique role in both sectors gives it a strong chance to succeed.What makes Altura special is not just its innovative approach but also its potential for massive returns. Experts predict it could deliver gains as high as 10x to 20x for early investors. While other coins may also rise during altcoin season, they might not provide the same explosive returns as Altura . Its focus on two of the fastest-growing industries‚ÄîAI and gaming‚Äîpositions it as a leader in the space. Final Thoughts The current struggles in the altcoin market are closely tied to Bitcoin's dominance. As long as BTC.D stays high, altcoins are likely to remain under pressure. However, history shows that this trend doesn‚Äôt last forever. Once BTC.D starts to decline, altcoin season can begin, creating exciting opportunities for smaller coins.For investors looking to maximize their returns, keeping an eye on promising projects like Altura ($ALU) is essential. With its strong use of AI and its position in the rapidly growing NFT and gaming sectors, Altura could lead the next wave of altcoin growth and deliver impressive returns in the coming months. Its low current market cap makes it a prime candidate for explosive gains, offering a rare opportunity in the crypto market. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Currently, the Bitcoin price is retesting the support line of an Ascending Channel after crashing below $95,000. A crypto analyst has predicted that if it can hold this key support level, it could stage a recovery and skyrocket to its next bullish target, aligning with the upper resistance line of the channel. Bitcoin Price Retest Support Line; New Target In Sight In a chart illustrating Bitcoin‚Äôs price movement within an Ascending Channel, Trader Tardigrade, a crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), revealed that the cryptocurrency has temporarily declined below the lower support line on the channel. The analyst labeled this decline a ‚ÄúFalse Break,‚Äù highlighting that the Ascending Channel remains intact despite the drop. Related Reading: Ethereum Total Value Locked Reaches Highest Level Since 2022 After Crossing $90 Billion, Will Price Follow? As indicated by the red circle in the price chart, the False Break suggests that Bitcoin‚Äôs brief move below the support level was short-lived and does not confirm the continuation of its previous downtrend. Trader Tardigrade noted that after Bitcoin‚Äôs False break, the cryptocurrency quickly moved back into the Ascending Channel to reclaim the lower support line. Interestingly, Bitcoin‚Äôs drop below the False break comes as the pioneer cryptocurrency experienced a sharp price crash below $95,000. Lately, the flagship cryptocurrency has been under significantly bearish pressure, recording notable declines as market volatility intensifies. Despite this bearish performance, Trader Tardigrade has disclosed that Bitcoin is now retesting the channel‚Äôs support line again, aiming to break above and trigger a price reversal. The analyst predicts that if Bitcoin can hold this support line, it will likely continue moving upwards within the channel. Consequently, the analyst has forecasted that Bitcoin‚Äôs next price target would be the upper resistance line of the Ascending Channel. Looking at the price chart, the channel points upwards towards a range between $110,000 and $112,000. If Bitcoin can successfully recover toward the upper resistance line, it could signal the continuation of a bullish trend within the Ascending Channel. Additionally, a breakout above the resistance line could further validate the bullish momentum, setting up a stage for Bitcoin to potentially target higher price levels and possibly retest its all-time high. Related Reading: Here Are The Major Bitcoin Support Levels To Watch As Bulls Push For $100,000 Again Analyst Says Bitcoin Could Crash To $87,000 Bitcoin is currently in a downward trend, experiencing severe price declines despite analysts‚Äô optimistic projections of a price surge. According to crypto analyst Titan of Crypto, the Bitcoin price could see another decline, with the support level at $87,000 being the next target. However, according to the analyst, a drop to this price low could bring ‚Äúmaximum pain‚Äù to both short‚Äîand long-term investors. Nevertheless, Titan of Crypto believes this severe price decline could also present a strong foundation for Bitcoin‚Äôs next price rally. He emphasized that price movements are rarely linear, highlighting the crypto market‚Äôs inherent unpredictability and volatility. Despite Bitcoin‚Äôs bearish behavior, Titan of Crypto confidently predicts that a price rally to $110,000 is inevitable.

Cardano Price Outlook & Dogecoin Whale Activity Soar,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdags-whitepaper-v3-reveals-tech-progress-cardano-price-outlook-dogecoin-whale-activity-soar/,"As the altcoin sector braces for an expected $2.5 trillion surge, giants like Cardano, Dogecoin, and BlockDAG (BDAG) are picking up steam. The Cardano price outlook is attracting attention with a surge in whale activity as hefty investors scoop up 160 million ADA tokens following its recent slip to $0.91. In tandem, Dogecoin whales are tactically maneuvering through critical support levels, eyeing the $0.684 mark. On the other hand, BlockDAG, fresh off the release of its Whitepaper V3, continues to draw in crypto whales eager for the next blockbuster financial opportunity. The whitepaper sheds light on significant updates and strategic plans for BlockDAG‚Äôs tech through 2025. What‚Äôs more, this utility-centric project is causing a splash in the presale market, having raised over $173 million across 26 batches, rapidly closing in on its ambitious $600 million target. Cardano Price Outlook: Will It Breach $1 & Hit $2.27? The buzz around Cardano price outlook is growing as major investors accumulate 160 million ADA tokens post its dip to $0.91. After a 6% recovery, ADA now trades at $0.95, with forecasts suggesting it could rise to $1.2 soon if it surpasses the critical $1 mark. Looking further ahead, the long-term outlook sets a $2.27 target, making the $1 level crucial for upward momentum. Yet, the road to recovery for Cardano price outlook is not without its bumps. The drop in daily active users by 58% poses questions about lasting engagement. Furthermore, there are worries about its resilience in holding the $0.90 support amid market ups and downs. Can Dogecoin Whale Activity Push to $0.415? A recent update from @CryptoMichNL on platform X underscored that the ‚ÄúAltcoin market capitalization has beautifully retested and is set to climb to $2.5T.‚Äù This statement underscores the heightened activity across altcoins, notably Dogecoin, which continues to captivate due to significant whale movements. Currently at $0.348, Dogecoin Whale movements have maintained the essential $0.264 support level, targeting $0.415 and $0.684. While such whales frequently ignite price hikes, their influence brings about concerns regarding market equilibrium. Observers note that Dogecoin‚Äôs limited utility detracts from its competitiveness, and its volatile price trends cause hesitation among investors, highlighting the need for more robust fundamentals to sustain long-term growth. BlockDAG‚Äôs Whitepaper V3: Tackling Crypto‚Äôs Scalability & Privacy Issues The anticipated altcoin boom, projected to push the market to a staggering $2.5 trillion, has all eyes on ventures ready to lead this explosive growth. At the forefront is BlockDAG, a cutting-edge blockchain platform reshaping the crypto landscape. Having already amassed over $173 million by offloading more than 17.5 billion BDAG coins, BlockDAG has outstripped all expectations. Early backers have witnessed an incredible 2,240% growth in their holdings, as the price of BDAG coins skyrocketed from an initial $0.001 to $0.0234 in the current batch. BlockDAG‚Äôs recently launched Whitepaper V3 has enthralled both developers and whales, unveiling advanced solutions that tackle scalability, privacy, and compatibility challenges. It seamlessly integrates the UTXO model for private transactions and the account-based model for Ethereum-compatible smart contracts, creating an ideal platform for DeFi, dApps, and NFTs. The document also introduces the Phantom GhostDAG protocol, pioneering a partially ordered transaction system that slashes fees while safeguarding transaction integrity, setting a new efficiency standard in the blockchain arena. This innovation is igniting a flurry of interest among crypto enthusiasts, fueling a swift uptick in presale holdings. Market experts now believe BlockDAG could hit its $600 million presale goal sooner than anticipated. With BDAG coins in high demand, the ongoing presale batch is nearing completion, poised to trigger a sharp price rise in the subsequent phase. For those eyeing the best crypto project , the time to dive in is now, before the opportunity dwindles and prices spike. What is the Best Crypto Project? The altcoin arena is abuzz, with the Cardano price outlook hinting at renewed whale accumulations, and Dogecoin whale activity solidifying key supports. Yet, the spotlight is increasingly on BlockDAG, which is setting new standards with its latest Whitepaper V3 and impressive presale achievements. Having already surpassed the $173 million mark, BlockDAG is quickly nearing its $600 million goal. For those still pondering the next big crypto project, BlockDAG is emerging as a standout contender, offering unparalleled growth potential.

Trump Cyborg (TRUMPCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCYB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Cyborg launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Cyborg on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Cyborg by entering its contract address ‚Äì 9yaNQ89EaQ2nEDczZpuTZfDwfiYCxbwSYC4JeiWLDE57 ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCYB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-28 00:07:43

Sounds like a dream portfolio, doesn‚Äôt it? In the fast-paced crypto world, where fortunes can be made overnight, three names stand out: BTFD Coin (BTFD), Ponke (PONKE), and COQ Inu (COQ). Each is blazing a unique trail in the meme coin landscape. BTFD Coin has captivated investors with its massive presale success, Ponke is breaking boundaries with decentralised utility, and COQ Inu is charting new territory with cutting-edge interoperability. Here‚Äôs why these projects are the top new meme coins with 1000X potential. BTFD Coin: A Festive Presale Like No Other Let‚Äôs start with the hottest meme coin on the block‚Äîthe BTFD Coin. Imagine an investment that not only promises massive returns but also rewards you with a 50% bonus just for getting in early. In Stage 13 of its presale, BTFD is priced at $0.000142 per coin, and with the BIG50 code, investors can maximise their holdings. This isn‚Äôt just a coin; it‚Äôs a movement. ‚Äú Buy The Dip ‚Äù isn‚Äôt just a slogan‚Äîit‚Äôs a strategy. The project is built on the principle that dips are opportunities, not setbacks. It‚Äôs no wonder BTFD has already raised over $4.6 million, sold 60 billion coins, and attracted 6,900+ enthusiastic holders. The coin‚Äôs Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, now in beta, is adding another layer of excitement. While rewards aren‚Äôt live yet, the gameplay is drawing attention from both gamers and investors. Add to this a staking system offering 90% APY and a referral programme that‚Äôs turning the community into a marketing powerhouse, and it‚Äôs clear BTFD is here to stay. To paint a picture, investing $5,000 at the current presale price would get you 35.2 million BTFD coins. With the BIG50 bonus, that jumps to 52.8 million. When the coin lists at $0.0006, your investment could balloon to $31,680. Joining is simple. Visit the BTFD Presale Page , connect your wallet, don‚Äôt forget to apply the BIG50 code for 50% extra BTFD Coins, and secure your investment before January 5, 2025. Act fast! Ponke: Utility That Sets It Apart Ponke is more than just another meme coin. With the launch of PonkeSwap, a decentralised exchange, it‚Äôs proving that meme coins can offer real-world utility. This move positions Ponke as a serious contender in the crypto space, appealing to both meme enthusiasts and utility-focused investors. Despite its innovative strides, Ponke has faced its share of challenges. After its Binance Futures listing, the coin experienced a short-lived surge, climbing from $0.44 to $0.55, only to settle at its current price of $0.32. While the volatility might deter some, it also presents an opportunity for those who believe in Ponke‚Äôs long-term vision. Ponke‚Äôs ability to adapt and innovate, particularly in the decentralised finance (DeFi) space, makes it a coin to watch. Its commitment to blending entertainment and functionality sets it apart in a crowded market. COQ Inu: Innovation Through Interoperability COQ Inu is rewriting the playbook for meme coins by integrating Chainlink‚Äôs Cross-Chain Token Standard. This technological leap allows COQ to operate seamlessly across multiple blockchains, making it more accessible and versatile than many of its competitors. Currently priced at $0.00000157, COQ Inu has seen a 15.74% price dip over the past week. While this might raise eyebrows, it‚Äôs important to remember that innovation often comes with growing pains. COQ‚Äôs focus on technological advancement positions it as a long-term player in the meme coin space. By addressing the interoperability challenge, COQ Inu is not just riding the meme coin wave‚Äîit‚Äôs leading it. Investors who value cutting-edge solutions in the crypto space will find COQ Inu‚Äôs approach both refreshing and promising. Turning Dips Into Opportunities The 1973 stock market crash taught us an invaluable lesson: downturns aren‚Äôt failures; they‚Äôre opportunities. Smart investors turned that chaos into immense wealth by buying undervalued assets. BTFD Coin embodies this ethos, offering a chance to invest before the next bull run. By focusing on presale opportunities, BTFD allows investors to get in early, maximise their returns, and ride the wave of its innovative ecosystem. Conclusion If you‚Äôre looking for the top new meme coins with 1000X potential , BTFD Coin is the standout choice based on current trends. Its limited-time 50% bonus, thriving presale, and innovative features make it a must-have for forward-thinking investors. While Ponke and COQ Inu bring their unique strengths to the table, it‚Äôs BTFD‚Äôs momentum and ROI potential that truly shine. Don‚Äôt miss your chance to be part of this revolution.

The Bitget Token ( BGB ) is trading at $7.37 at time of writing and is up nearly 28% in the past 24 hours and more than 70% in the past week. BGB‚Äôs gains partially materialized amid news that Bitget plans to merge the token with its other native asset, the Bitget Wallet Token ( BWB ). BWB, the 638th-ranked crypto asset by market cap, is down more than 4% in the past day but up nearly 45% in the past week. Bitget‚Äôs merger will unify both tokens under the BGB label. The exchange says the decision was driven by community demand. Explains Bitget chief executive Gracy Chen, ‚ÄúBy merging BGB and BWB, we are taking a major step toward building a unified and robust ecosystem that bridges on-chain and off-chain applications. This move will enhance the utility of BGB, and ensure that every holder benefits from Bitget ecosystem growth.‚Äù Bitget says BWB holders on the exchange can automatically swap their BWB to BGB at a 0.08563 ratio, which the firm says was calculated using a 7-day average closing price of the BWB/USDT pair on Bitget. BGB is currently the 22nd-ranked crypto asset by market cap. The overall crypto market cap dropped by 4.7% on Thursday, according to CoinGecko.

As we approach 2025, investors and enthusiasts are keen to identify which cryptocurrencies will lead the charge. Here‚Äôs a curated list of the top five cryptocurrencies expected to make a substantial impact: 1. Qubetics ($TICS) Qubetics is making waves by integrating decentralised Virtual Private Networks (dVPNs) into its ecosystem. This addition enhances user privacy and supports various decentralised services, including DeFi, NFTs, and decentralised storage. Qubetics dVPN upholds the core principles of autonomy and decentralisation central to Web3 by ensuring secure and private connections.Currently, in Presale Phase 14, Qubetics offers a compelling opportunity for early investors. With TICS tokens priced at $0.037, the project has already raised over $7.9 million, attracted more than 12,100 holders, and sold 379 million tokens. The presale structure includes weekly phases with a 10% price hike, culminating in a 20% increase in the final stage. Analysts project a post-presale target of $0.25 per token, indicating a potential ROI of 563.81% for early adopters. Forecasts suggest that Qubetics could reach $10 to $15 after the mainnet launch, underscoring its potential as a top cryptocurrency to watch in 2025 . 2. Bitcoin (BTC) As the pioneer of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin continues to dominate the market. In 2024, Bitcoin experienced significant gains, surpassing $100,000 due to interest in spot Bitcoin ETFs, a supply-reducing halving event, and expectations of pro-crypto policies following political developments. Analysts maintain a largely positive outlook for Bitcoin through 2025, with varying predictions. Bitwise forecasts Bitcoin could attain $200,000 and potentially $500,000 if the U.S. government adopts a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Standard Chartered shares a positive outlook, while VanEck projects Bitcoin reaching $180,000 amidst significant volatility. 3. Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink‚Äôs decentralised oracle network is a cornerstone in the blockchain ecosystem, providing reliable real-world data to smart contracts. Its effectiveness in integrating off-chain data with on-chain applications has led to widespread adoption across various sectors. As blockchain technology continues to permeate different industries, Chainlink's role becomes increasingly vital, positioning it as a promising investment for those looking toward 2025. 4. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum remains at the forefront of decentralised applications and smart contract platforms. The anticipated full deployment of Ethereum 2.0 aims to address scalability issues, potentially leading to higher transaction speeds and lower gas fees. This evolution could further solidify Ethereum's position as a leading platform for DeFi, NFTs, and other blockchain-based applications. Analysts project that Ethereum could trade in a wide range, with a minimum price of $2,670 and a maximum of $5,990 by 2025, depending on market momentum. 5. VeChain (VET) VeChain focuses on enhancing supply chain efficiency and sustainability through its innovative use of decentralised technology. VeChain enables businesses to streamline operations and build consumer trust by providing transparent and tamper-proof data on products and services. As global supply chains become increasingly complex, VeChain's solutions are well-positioned to address these challenges, making it a cryptocurrency to watch in the coming years. Conclusion The cryptocurrency market is poised for significant developments as we approach 2025. Projects like Qubetics , with its innovative dVPN integration and established players like Bitcoin, Chainlink, Ethereum, and VeChain, offer diverse opportunities for investors and technology enthusiasts alike. Staying informed and conducting thorough research are essential steps for anyone looking to navigate this dynamic landscape and capitalise on the potential growth of these digital assets.

Says Oppenheimer banking analyst Chris Kotowski, ‚ÄúOnce you get much below the biggest banks, then it does become really hard to make the necessary investments and have the same name recognition‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre a very mobile society, especially since Covid. Lots of people that move from New York to Florida for example, do you really need to have a different bank in Florida than you do in New York?‚Äù The consolidation of power by the biggest US banks highlights the struggle of smaller institutions to deal with regulation, volatile interest rates and the ability of larger banks to spread their presence digitally across the country.

Prince Elon launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Prince Elon on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Prince Elon by entering its contract address ‚Äì 7rAsmWGTtPFY9RFnhd9biard7PrWtw5ZigowwfmaXUQ ‚Äì in the receiving field. If you don‚Äôt have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks ‚Äì or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONPRIN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-28 01:27:00

Dogecoin Has Seen Positive Signals On TD Sequential & Whale Supply In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a Tom Demark (TD) Sequential signal that Dogecoin has just witnessed on its 4-hour price chart. The ‚ÄúTD Sequential‚Äù refers to a technical analysis indicator that‚Äôs used for locating points of probable reversal for any asset‚Äôs price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Tokens Have Only Been Getting Older This Bull Run, Analyst Reveals The indicator includes two phases, called the setup and countdown. During the first of these, the setup, candles in the price of the same color are counted up to nine. These candles aren‚Äôt necessary to be consecutive. When the nine candles are in, the setup is said to be finished, and the TD Sequential gives a reversal signal for the asset. Naturally, if the candles involved in the setup‚Äôs completion were green, the indicator would suggest a top, and if they were red, the signal would be for a bottom. As soon as the setup is over, the countdown phase begins. This phase of the TD Sequential works exactly the same as the setup, except for the fact that it involves thirteen candles, not nine. Once these candles have also been printed, the indicator gives another buy or sell signal for the price. Recently, Dogecoin has finished the first of these TD Sequential phases. Here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows this signal in DOGE‚Äôs 4-hour price: As is visible in the above graph, the Dogecoin 4-hour price has completed the TD Sequential setup with nine green candles, which implies the coin may now be set for a turnaround to the upside. This isn‚Äôt the only positive signal that DOGE has observed recently, as Martinez has pointed out in another X post¬†that the whales have been busy purchasing during the last couple of days. The on-chain indicator cited by the analyst is the Supply Distribution from the analytics firm Santiment, which tells us about the amount of supply that any particular wallet group is holding right now. Below is the chart for the metric that specifically shows the data for the whale cohort, massive investors carrying between 10 million and 100 million tokens: From the graph, it‚Äôs apparent that the Dogecoin supply held by the whales has registered an increase recently. More specifically, the whales have added a net amount of 90 million DOGE (worth around $28.7 million) to their holdings in the last two days. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Bull Run Over?

In an interview with Anthony Pompliano, he pointed out that while the SEC was targeting Ripple, other high-profile figures like Sam Bankman-Fried were involved in serious financial misconduct without facing similar regulatory pressure. Gasparino argued that this was an example of regulatory overreach. He also said that Ripple‚Äôs technology, which underlies XRP, has potential but is now forced to operate overseas due to the lack of clear regulations in the U.S. The SEC‚Äôs legal actions have created uncertainty, and even after a judge made a decision in favor of Ripple, Gasparino criticized the ruling. ‚ÄúSo they ( the SEC) bring the case, they get this judge who says, ‚ÄòOh no, the investors, the retail investors don‚Äôt need the disclosure, they‚Äôre okay not disclosing to retail, but they should have disclosed it to the institution.‚Äô This idiotic judge didn‚Äôt even know that she established precedent that there should be less disclosure for retail,‚Äù he said The judge had decided that Ripple did not need to disclose information to retail investors but should have disclosed it to institutional investors, a move Gasparino called ‚Äústupid.‚Äù He said that the ruling created a dangerous precedent for less disclosure for retail investors, explaining the mess that the case had become. Gasparino explained that his interest in Ripple began years earlier when he covered Ethereum‚Äôs efforts to establish its own regulatory framework, which led to a viral reaction after a clip of his reporting was shared by a Ripple supporter.

Top Crypto to Buy Now Amid Solana‚Äôs $776M Inflows and Ethereum Whale Moves What if you could secure your financial future by investing in the right crypto at the right time? With blockchain technology rapidly redefining our digital interactions, picking the top cryptos to buy and hold for the long term has never been more crucial. The latest updates on Ethereum and Solana are stirring the crypto market, but the buzz around Qubetics ($TICS) is stealing the spotlight. While Ethereum faces market tremors from whale activity and Solana demonstrates its robust market recovery, Qubetics‚Äô presale generates unmatched excitement. This article will explore the developments of Qubetics, Solana, and Ethereum, helping you decide which crypto is the most promising to buy and hold for the long term. Qubetics: Transforming Web3 Privacy with dVPN In a world where digital privacy is constantly threatened, Qubetics ($TICS) is rewriting the rules. As part of its expansive Web3 infrastructure, Qubetics offers a decentralised VPN (dVPN) service. Unlike traditional VPN providers, which often track and control user data, the Qubetics dVPN relies on a peer-to-peer, blockchain-powered network. This decentralisation means no single entity can manipulate or monitor your online activity, ensuring true privacy and resistance to censorship. What makes this even more compelling is how it incentivises participation. Users who share bandwidth are rewarded with TICS tokens, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem. Enhanced security features, such as multi-hop routing and end-to-end encryption, bolster anonymity and protect sensitive data. This innovation makes Qubetics a standout among the top cryptos to buy and hold for the long term. Qubetics recently hosted an engaging AMA session, providing insights into their vision and addressing community questions. This transparent approach reinforces its commitment to building trust and fostering a loyal investor base. Solana: A Marriage of Innovation and Controversy Solana has made headlines for reasons beyond its technological advancements. Co-founder Stephen Akridge, embroiled in a legal dispute, faces allegations of withholding yield generated by Solana tokens during a divorce settlement. Despite this drama, Solana‚Äôs performance speaks volumes. With $776 million in daily inflows, the blockchain is cementing its reputation as a reliable platform for developers and investors alike. Boasting faster transactions and lower costs, Solana continues to attract attention as a leading competitor in the crypto space. It‚Äôs a testament to its potential for long-term growth, even amidst personal controversies. Ethereum: Whale Activity Sparks Investor Curiosity Ethereum, one of the most established blockchains, recently experienced significant activity. An ICO whale, known for strategic profit-taking, transferred 4,160 ETH‚Äîworth approximately $14.5 million‚Äîto Kraken. This move has raised concerns about potential selling pressure, which could lead to short-term price fluctuations. Historically, this whale has timed exits during market peaks, as seen with a $10.1 million sale earlier this month. Such activity fuels speculation about Ethereum‚Äôs immediate market trends. However, its long-term value remains undisputed, making it a staple in any portfolio. The Qubetics Presale: A Gateway to Early-Stage Gains The Qubetics presale is where the excitement truly builds. Currently, in Phase 14, $TICS tokens are priced at $0.037. With over $7.9 million raised, 12,100+ holders, and 379 million tokens sold, this presale has already captured significant attention. Investors are flocking to secure their share, knowing that each phase brings a 10% price increase, culminating in a 20% surge in the final stage. Missing out now could mean paying more later, making it one of the top cryptos to buy and hold for the long term. The momentum surrounding Qubetics is growing daily, driven by its unique use cases and token economics. Early investors gain financially and position themselves at the forefront of blockchain innovation. Will you be one of them? Conclusion: Which Crypto Should You Back? The crypto market is alive with opportunities, and each coin‚ÄîEthereum, Solana, and Qubetics ($TICS)‚Äîoffers unique advantages. Ethereum‚Äôs proven history, Solana‚Äôs technological prowess, and Qubetics‚Äô innovative dVPN service collectively highlight why these are the top cryptos to buy and hold long-term.

38208512,https://coinpedia.org/?p=399073,1735353094,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,XRP Price Prediction For December 28,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-prediction-for-december-28/,"The post XRP Price Prediction For December 28 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ripple‚Äôs XRP is currently consolidating on the larger time frame, with no major price correction. Instead, the market is moving sideways, hinting at a period of consolidation within an overall uptrend. At the time of writing, XRP is down by more than two percent and is trading at $2.17. Uptrend Still in Play Despite the current consolidation, the overall trend for XRP is still bullish. The price action looks like a temporary pullback, rather than the start of a downtrend. If the price continues to move upward, it could challenge its all-time high of around $3.25 to $3.30, which also aligns with a critical Fibonacci level. Holding Above the 2021 High A key point to note is that XRP is holding above its 2021 high of $1.96. This is a strong signal of market strength. Maintaining this level is crucial for XRP‚Äôs continued positive momentum, and as long as the price stays above this, the market outlook remains favorable. Short-Term Market Behavior: Triangle Formation On the shorter time frame, XRP is currently forming a triangle pattern. While triangle patterns can lead to breakouts in either direction, they are fragile and tend to be less reliable. As a result, there is a possibility of short-term bearish action, but the price could also break to the upside. Key Levels for Risk Management For traders, it‚Äôs important to monitor the key support and resistance levels within this triangle. The price must hold above the $1.95 support level to maintain the triangle pattern. If it falls below this point, the likelihood of a bearish move increases, and the triangle scenario may be invalidated. The $1.95 level is the key support for XRP and if the price stays above this, the consolidation pattern is likely to continue. However, if the price drops below this level, we could see a more significant pullback, with the next support areas being around $1.80 to $1.39.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-28 02:31:34
