With an 80% reduction in volatility, Chainlink shows signs of a looming breakout as Smart DEX traders ramp up their positions. Simultaneously, SUI coin has approached key support levels following a predictable downturn, leaving traders anticipating a possible rebound. Amid these market shifts, BlockDAG (BDAG) captures the spotlight. With over 500,000 users, BlockDAG’s X1 Miner App has become a viral sensation, simplifying how to mine BDAG from smartphones. This surge in activity comes just in time as the window to mine BDAG before its anticipated exchange listings begins to close, highlighting BlockDAG as a potential best crypto for 2025 . For those eyeing substantial returns, now is the time to engage before the mining rewards taper off. Over 500,000 Users Mining BDAG: Here’s Your Chance to Join The popularity of the BlockDAG X1 Miner App has skyrocketed, with the user count crossing the half-million mark as enthusiasts rush to mine BDAG directly from their phones. This method, free from the complexities of traditional mining setups, offers a straightforward path to acquiring crypto. With BDAG poised for upcoming major exchange listings, current miners are strategically positioning themselves to accumulate coins before the expected surge in demand. If you’re scouting for the best crypto for 2025 , mining BDAG now could significantly amplify your portfolio’s growth potential. The presale of BlockDAG has successfully garnered $199 million, with BDAG currently valued at $0.0248 in its 27th batch. Early adopters have witnessed a staggering 2,380% gain, with projections suggesting a potential rise to $1 by 2025. LINK Price Sees Reduced Volatility: A Precursor to Surge? LINK’s volatility has sharply decreased to 80%, drawing the attention of savvy traders who predict a significant move ahead. Historically, reduced volatility often precedes a market breakout, and Smart DEX traders are not just watching—they’re actively increasing their holdings. With notable wallets accumulating LINK, including one that previously secured a 136% return, the sentiment is bullish. As the market anticipates LINK’s next move, the rising Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) suggests an uptick in buying pressure, possibly steering LINK price towards a breakout. SUI Coin’s Price Dynamics: Testing Key Support Levels The Sui coin has traced a path consistent with predictions, falling to $3.5165 before it tested the lower support at $3.2379. This trajectory aligns precisely with prior analyses, validating a robust pattern in its price movements. Currently, traders are closely monitoring to see if SUI maintains these levels or further declines to $2.5611. The latest insights indicate that crucial resistance and support levels are still active, and there could be a turnaround if the momentum shifts. Looking forward, should the Sui coin stabilize above $5.5840, it might set the stage for a confirmed breakout. Successfully retesting the $4.40 level could propel the coin towards $5.7788 and potentially higher. If the upward trend persists, SUI could aim for successive targets at $8.1673, $9.0186, and even $12.9780. The imminent days will be pivotal in determining whether SUI is poised for a significant rebound. In Summary As LINK price shows newfound stability and potential for growth, and SUI coin navigates critical support levels, the crypto market remains on edge. Meanwhile, BlockDAG’s X1 Miner App has attracted a massive user base, poised for success as one of the best crypto for 2025 . As these developments unfold, the race to secure prime positions in the burgeoning crypto landscape is intensifying.

In a new announcement, Binance says its adding support for MyShell ( SHELL ), a protocol that allows users to create, share and own AI agents that can be used for professional and personal assistance as well as companionship. News of addition sent SHELL flying as the digital asset went from a low of $0.462 on February 26th to a peak of $0.661 just a day later. SHELL has since retraced and is trading for $0.597 at time of writing, a 24.4% gain during the last 24 hours. According to MyShell’s official website, the current crypto AI landscape is too centralized as it has closed ecosystems, a lack of incentives, and excessive restrictions, issues the projects aims to fix. “The rise of artificial intelligence has given birth to a notable phenomenon – the closed-source model ecosystem. Led by OpenAI, these powerful yet proprietary models offer users advanced applications and services for complex data analysis and human-computer interactions. However, behind their impressive capabilities lie some lesser-known costs… MyShell was born from a deep reflection on the current AI landscape.

March 2025 is shaping up to be a pivotal month for several major crypto projects, with groundbreaking developments, strategic partnerships, and increased adoption fueling the industry’s momentum. The battle for dominance among blockchain networks has intensified, with the focus shifting toward real-world use cases, scalability, and decentralization. One of the most exciting projects right now is Qubetics ($TICS ) —a revolutionary blockchain platform solving the cross-border transaction inefficiencies that have plagued legacy financial systems. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies that focus solely on decentralization, Qubetics is bridging the gap between security, speed, and real-world utility, making it an appealing prospect for early buyers. Let’s explore the top five cryptocurrencies to watch this month: Qubetics, Cronos, Render, Stellar, and Celestia. 1.

The project has gained significant traction, with its presale currently in its 23rd stage, having already sold over 490 million tokens to more than 21,500 holders—raising an impressive $14.1 million.

Analysts predict a potential surge in value, with $TICS projected to hit $0.25 at the end of the presale (a 181% ROI). Post-launch, forecasts indicate the potential for exponential growth, reaching $1, $5, or even $15 after the mainnet launch. Real-Life Impact: Cross-Border Transactions Qubetics is redefining cross-border payments, addressing challenges such as high fees, slow processing times, and centralization risks.

Notably, this comment is gaining attention in the crypto community when the market is experiencing major declines. Bitcoin Price Outlook Amid Market Fluctuations In a recent development, Kendrick reiterated his speculations that Bitcoin will hit $200,000 by the end of this year and climb to $500,000 before Donald Trump leaves office. His comments come after Bitcoin’s price dropped to a three-month low, sinking below $90,000 earlier this week. According to CoinGecko data, the cryptocurrency was trading at $86,418 earlier this week, marking a 20% decline from its all-time high of $108,786 in January. In addition, the Stanford analyst linked this decline to broader economic concerns, including uncertainty surrounding global trade tariffs and unending geopolitical tensions in regions like Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Gaza. Institutional Adoption and Regulatory Developments Furthermore, Kendrick’s recent comments also relate that institutional involvement is key to stabilizing Bitcoin and driving long-term growth. He added that conventional financial firms like Standard Chartered and BlackRock, which have introduced Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), will play a crucial role in bringing legitimacy and reducing market volatility. He also pointed out that clear regulations in the U.S. will be a driving mechanism that will strengthen the stability of digital assets in the country. This would encourage larger financial institutions to invest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Additionally, he asserted that as the clear engagement policies take shape, more U.S. banks and institutional investors will step into the crypto space, potentially leading to a more structured and secure market environment. Trump’s Influence on Crypto Growth It is necessary to add that political factors also shape Bitcoin’s future, with Donald Trump’s presidency playing a key role. After his December election victory, Bitcoin surged past $100,000 for the first time, fueled by optimism from investors who see him as pro-crypto. In January 2025, Trump signed an executive order to boost cryptocurrency adoption and create a national digital asset stockpile, reinforcing his administration’s support for the industry. Crypto firms and executives also played a major role in the 2024 election, contributing nearly half of corporate donations, with some investing tens of millions into Trump’s campaign. With strong backing from the industry, Kendrick believes Bitcoin could still hit $500,000 before Trump leaves office.

The body is named the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors’ Office-run Joint Investigation Unit (JIU) for Virtual Asset Crimes. The unit has been operating since 2023. But it was originally intended to function as a temporary task force. It was formed to fight what officials thought would be a short-lived spike in high-profile crypto-related fraud cases. Crypto Crime: New Unit to Tackle Fraud Cases However, the JIU has been inundated with work since its formation. And with crypto adoption and crypto-related crime on the rise in South Korea, last month, the prosecution service decided to formalize the body and grant it a certain degree of independence . A launching ceremony for the Joint Digital Asset Crime Investigation Division, held in Seoul, South Korea on February 27, 2025. (Source: Yonhap TV News/Screenshot) Per Aju News and MBC News , the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors’ Office has essentially “promoted” to the level of “formal joint investigation department.” As its name suggests, the body consists of public prosecutors. But it also comprises 11 financial regulators staffers from the Financial Services Commission and the Financial Supervisory Service. The JIU will initially have 34 full-time employees in total. Most of the staffers already have considerable experience dealing with crypto-related fraud cases. At a launching ceremony, the body vowed to investigate “unfair” crypto “practices.” These include insider trading and price manipulation cases. Since its initial inception, the body has indicted 74 people and arrested 25 individuals. A South Korean appeals court will decide next month whether the country’s main opposition leader violated election laws https://t.co/FqJPaLoKJx — Bloomberg (@business) February 26, 2025 Front-page News In recent months, the JIU’s operations became the subject of front-page news, when it began probing a suspected scam coin named Queenbee. The investigation eventually led the JIU to indict a high-profile shaman named Jeon Seong-bae, aka Geon Jin. The JIU arrested the shaman on suspicions of “handling illegal political funds from politicians and candidates” during the nation’s 2018 local elections. The unit will be led by Chief Prosecutor Park Geon-wook. His team also comprises two deputy chief prosecutors. The Southern District Prosecutors’ Office said that as crypto fraudsters become more “sophisticated, intelligent, and globalized,” it would create an “effective crime response system.” The post South Korean Prosecution Crypto Crime Unit Officially Launches appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|Legal|South Korea,EN,0,0,ASIA|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-02-27 23:30:00

Analysts debate Ripple’s impact, with concerns over lobbying against Bitcoin. SBI VC Trade expands lending services, boosting XRP adoption and utility. Ripple’s XRP has seen price declines recently. As a result, this has led to mixed reactions from analysts. Some think the cryptocurrency is struggling due to outside factors. However, others argue it remains strong against Bitcoin (BTC). Adding another layer to the story, Japanese exchange SBI VC Trade has increased its cryptocurrency lending services, which adds more options for XRP holders Conflicting Views on Market Performance Tony Edward has pushed back against Bitcoin maximalists. Specifically, he says they are unfairly singling out XRP’s decline when the entire crypto market is experiencing a general downturn.

California Democrat Rep. Sam Liccardo is leading the push against Trump’s meme coin, though he has insistently argued that taking aim at the president’s crypto token was not his original intention when he first ran for office. He claimed, however, that Trump’s move to release a new meme coin needed some kind of response, especially since the token’s price quickly plummeted, leaving some investors with losses. Liccardo believes President Trump’s decision to launch a meme coin was unethical and an abuse of his authority Liccardo, also a former criminal prosecutor, argued that the nation should reinstate stricter anti-corruption laws, targeting Trump’s meme çoin. According to him, Trump exploited his authority, office, and the people for his personal gain, calling the president’s actions “unethical.” He added that Trump’s token raised concerns about transparency, insider trading, and improper foreign influence, saying that even some of Trump’s supporters disapproved of the meme coin launch. Thus, he introduced legislation against the token on Thursday, the Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement, or MEME Act. Liccardo even stated he had about a dozen Democratic cosponsors backing his legislation. The bill should apply to the president, vice president, Congress members, senior executive officials, and their immediate families. Violators could face fines and up to five years in prison. The bill’s draft so far dictates that Trump will have to give up his earnings from the token’s sale. Moreover, the legislation will prevent the president, any of his family members or members of Congress from issuing or promoting securities and crypto assets like meme coins. The legislation would also introduce criminal and civil penalties and bans on some financial assets. Additionally, private investors who lose their funds on meme coins promoted by state officials will be permitted to sue. Liccardo even commented, “You need to have some enforcement mechanism and a private right of action helps to keep everybody honest.” However, the bill may fail to pass in the now Republican-controlled Congress, but he believes that the legislation will lay the groundwork for Democrats if they regain power or at least show their stance against Trump’s corruption. Trump and his family have been actively involved in several crypto projects Meme coins have long been considered risky and speculative assets, with most critics comparing them to Ponzi schemes that only profit insiders and unethical celebrities. When Trump first released his token, its price quickly surged to almost $70 before dropping to roughly $12. Nevertheless, analysts believe that the token generated millions of dollars for the launching entities before its immense price drop from its trading fees. The First Lady’s MELANIA token also saw a trajectory similar to that of Trump. It surged explosively after its launch but has since fallen from its peak days, trading at only $0.8522 . Not to mention, one of the developers involved in the MELANIA token launch was found to be tangled with the LIBRA token scandal, for which Argentine President Javier Milei is still being investigated. In addition to his and Melania’s token releases, Trump and his sons launched a decentralized crypto platform in 2024 and even supported online stores selling crypto-themed sneakers. However, the president has tried to distance himself from his family’s crypto projects and overall businesses by signing an ethics agreement that will hinder him from making outside business deals. Liccardo pushes MEME Act to curb corruption, but faces political and industry resistance The MEME Act has received backing from Reps. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). But its passage in the GOP-controlled Congress is highly unlikely. Liccardo said the bill is partly a symbolic step against corruption and a basis for action if Democrats regain state legislature control. Beyond meme coins, the legislation’s broad language captures all securities and digital assets, designed to harden loopholes for indirect profits. It also requires disclosures of foreign cryptocurrency ties, but the law presents challenges for enforcement. Mixed reactions from industry: Some crypto advocates took to social media to criticize Trump’s action as a “stunt,” while others characterized the bill as politically unviable. The proposal showcases growing scrutiny of officials’ financial conduct in financial markets. The freshman lawmaker representing Silicon Valley’s 16th District since January 2025, has positioned himself as an advocate for ethical governance with the MEME Act. Yet his party faces a great deal of scrutiny over inconsistencies in addressing financial conflicts. While a few Democrats, including progressives like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC), support banning congressional stock trading, establishment figures like former Speaker Nancy Pelosi have resisted such reforms. Pelosi’s husband, Paul Pelosi, faced criticism for trades made during the Covid-19 pandemic, including a $5 million windfall trading options in Alphabet shares in advance of a hearing on tech that she oversaw. Pelosi defended lawmakers’ right to trade in the markets, saying that some proposals were “anti-free market.” Public polls show that Americans support the limitations on what could be traded. Liccardo’s concern with meme coin regulation also underscores Democrats’ larger challenge of balancing their progressive reform aspirations with powerful financial interests.

Expert trader Raoul Pal shared a bullish comment regarding SOL price in a recent post on X. He believes the coin is at its oversold level and will likely plot a rebound soon. State of the Solana Price Considering his X account , Raoul Pal said SOL is at 2 standard deviations oversold on the log regression channel. He pointed out that Solana is showcasing the lowest Relative Strength Index (RSI) since the 2022 lows. Per the onchain data, the RSI dropped as low as 25.73 on February 26, way below the oversold level . As Pal pointed out, Solana is likely to grow significantly higher in the coming month. While he is not taking new positions at the current level, he implied that this period marks the best area to buy the dip. According to CoinMarketCap data, the price of Solana was trading for $137.16, up marginally by 0.47% in 24 hours. Although the volatility is yet to clear, SOL has recorded more than 1.2% against Bitcoin within the same period. With the current outlook, the coin has now pared off its price over the past week which has dropped by 21%. SOL Price Historical Trend in March The odds of Solana soaring in the coming month is high, as the coin has historically soared in March. Data from Cryptorank pegs the average growth rate in the price of Solana in March at 32.4%. In March 2021, SOL price jumped by 49%, complemented by a 23.2% rally in 2022. While the coin saw a 3.25% retracement, growth peaked in March 2024 when it skyrocketed by 60.8%. Solana Price Monthly Returns. Source: Cryptorank If historical trends play out again, the coin may pare off its losses over the past month, now pegged at 39.5%. Potential Growth Drivers to Watch With Coinbase’s lawsuit dismissed by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), it implies that the claim Solana is an investment contract no longer holds. Current improving regulations in the country have indirectly placed altcoins in a positive light. With the cases closed and the regulator clarifying that memecoins are not securities, innovators may re-ignite the meme hype. Notably, this marked one of the biggest catalysts that drove the coin’s price to an all-time high above $294. Ultimately, the Solana ETF hype may also continue, pushing the asset into a position for adoption by institutional investors if approved. With Franklin Templeton’s SOL ETF filing submitted to the US SEC, the participation is high, pushing the approval odds higher.

The market just witnessed a seismic event that has the entire crypto sphere buzzing. Leading on-chain analytics platform, CryptoQuant , has reported a jaw-dropping Bitcoin inflow of 6,779 BTC, valued at a staggering $573.6 million, flooding into spot exchanges within a mere hour. This sudden surge has sparked intense speculation – is this a precursor to a major market move, or just whales repositioning their assets? Let’s dive deep into the details of this intriguing development. Unpacking the Massive Bitcoin Inflow: CryptoQuant’s Alert When CryptoQuant , a trusted source for on-chain crypto analytics, raises an alarm, it’s time to pay attention. Their recent report highlights an “unusual” spike in Bitcoin inflow to exchanges. But what exactly does this mean, and why is it significant? Essentially, an inflow of Bitcoin to exchanges typically indicates an intent to sell. Traders move their BTC to exchanges to have it readily available for trading against other cryptocurrencies or fiat currencies. A large, rapid inflow, like the one CryptoQuant detected, can often precede periods of increased selling pressure and potential price volatility. Let’s break down the specifics of this substantial exchange inflow : Total Inflow: 6,779 BTC Value: $573.6 million (at the time of the report) Timeframe: Within one hour Now, let’s look at where this massive wave of Bitcoin landed. Coinbase Dominates the Bitcoin Exchange Inflow The lion’s share of this Bitcoin inflow landed on two prominent platforms: Coinbase Advanced and Coinbase Prime. Coinbase , a leading cryptocurrency exchange known for its institutional and retail client base, absorbed a significant portion of this influx. Here’s the detailed breakdown: Exchange Platform BTC Inflow Percentage Coinbase Advanced 3,355 BTC 49% Coinbase Prime 3,256 BTC 48% Bitstamp 108 BTC 1% Total 6,719 BTC 98% As you can see, Coinbase platforms accounted for a whopping 97% of the total inflow, with Coinbase Advanced and Coinbase Prime receiving nearly equal amounts. Bitstamp received a much smaller fraction. This concentration on Coinbase raises further questions – why Coinbase specifically? And what does it signal for the market? Why is a Large BTC Inflow to Exchanges Significant? Understanding the implications of a large BTC inflow is crucial for navigating the volatile crypto market. Here’s why this kind of movement matters: Potential Selling Pressure: As mentioned earlier, moving BTC to exchanges is often a precursor to selling. A large inflow suggests a significant number of holders might be preparing to liquidate their positions, potentially driving prices down. Market Sentiment Indicator: Sudden spikes in exchange inflow can reflect a shift in market sentiment. It could indicate growing bearishness or profit-taking after a price rally. Volatility Catalyst: Large inflows can inject volatility into the market. The increased supply on exchanges can lead to rapid price swings as traders react to the potential for increased selling pressure. Whale Activity: Such massive transfers are often associated with whale activity – large holders moving substantial amounts of Bitcoin. Tracking these flows can provide insights into whale strategies and potential market manipulation. Are There Alternative Explanations for the Exchange Inflow? While a large BTC inflow often points to selling pressure, it’s important to consider alternative explanations. CryptoQuant itself notes that: “Some of these deposits may be from customers using exchange custody solutions.” This is a crucial point. Here are a few alternative scenarios to consider: Custodial Services Repositioning: Exchanges like Coinbase offer custodial services to institutions and individuals. These entities might be moving funds between different custody solutions or consolidating assets on the exchange for various operational reasons, not necessarily for immediate selling. OTC Desk Transfers: Over-the-counter (OTC) desks often utilize exchanges for settlement. Large inflows could be related to OTC trades being settled on exchanges, which doesn’t always translate to immediate market selling. Internal Exchange Transfers: Exchanges themselves might be moving funds internally between different wallets or platforms for security or operational purposes. These internal movements could be misinterpreted as external inflows if not properly analyzed. Actionable Insights: Navigating Market Volatility So, what should crypto traders and investors make of this Bitcoin inflow ? Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Price Action Closely: Keep a close watch on Bitcoin’s price movement in the coming hours and days. Increased selling pressure could lead to price corrections. Track On-Chain Metrics: Continue to monitor on-chain data from platforms like CryptoQuant for further insights into exchange flows, whale activity, and other market indicators. Manage Risk: In times of potential market volatility, prudent risk management is key. Consider adjusting your portfolio allocations and using risk management tools like stop-loss orders. Stay Informed: Keep yourself updated with the latest market news and analysis from reputable sources to make informed decisions. Conclusion: Decoding the Bitcoin Exchange Inflow Mystery The sudden $573 million Bitcoin inflow to exchanges, as flagged by CryptoQuant , is undoubtedly a noteworthy event in the crypto market. While it could signal potential selling pressure and market volatility, alternative explanations like custodial repositioning and OTC transfers cannot be ruled out. The concentration of this inflow on Coinbase platforms adds another layer of intrigue to this development. As the market digests this information, close monitoring of price action and further on-chain data will be crucial to decipher the true implications of this massive Bitcoin movement.

40932328,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=135131,1740699766,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary Figure AI to Launch Astonishing Home Robot Alpha Testing in 2025,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/figure-ai-home-robot-testing/,"Get ready for a potentially groundbreaking shift in home technology! Figure AI, a robotics startup making waves, has just announced an accelerated timeline for bringing its humanoid robot into our homes. While the crypto world thrives on disruptive innovation, this development from Figure AI signals a tangible leap in robotics that could soon impact our daily lives in astonishing ways. Forget distant dreams of robot butlers – Figure is aiming to start “alpha testing” its Figure 02 humanoid robot in actual home settings as early as 2025. Let’s dive into what this means and why it’s happening sooner than many expected. Why the Accelerated Timeline for Home Robots? The Power of Helix Figure CEO Brett Adcock attributes this faster pace to their innovative “generalist” Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model, aptly named Helix. This sophisticated AI is the real engine behind Figure’s ambitious schedule. Here’s why Helix is a game-changer: Generalist Approach: Unlike narrow AI focused on specific tasks, Helix is designed to be a jack-of-all-trades. It can learn and adapt to a wider range of situations and tasks, crucial for the unpredictable nature of home environments. Vision and Language Fusion: Helix processes both visual data and natural language input. Imagine instructing your home robot with simple voice commands or showing it what needs to be done – Helix bridges the gap between human instruction and robotic action. Rapid Learning: This VLA model is built to accelerate the robot’s learning curve. The faster it can grasp new tasks, the quicker it can become truly useful in a dynamic home setting. This announcement of accelerated alpha testing comes hot on the heels of Figure unveiling Helix itself. The company’s strategic decision to move away from its publicized partnership with OpenAI in favor of proprietary AI models like Helix underscores their commitment to controlling and optimizing their AI foundation. This independence is key to driving innovation and tailoring the AI specifically for their humanoid robot ambitions. Home Sweet Home for Humanoid Robots? Figure’s Vision The idea of home robots isn’t entirely new, but Figure’s concrete timeline brings it closer to reality. We’ve even had glimpses into Figure’s home aspirations, with early lab tests showcased at their South Bay offices. Last week’s Helix reveal further illuminated these plans, showcasing videos of robots tackling various household chores – even food preparation! One particularly interesting aspect is Helix’s design to orchestrate two robots working together on a single task. This hints at a future where multiple humanoid robots might collaborate in our homes to tackle complex tasks more efficiently. Consider these potential home applications: Household Chores: From tidying up and doing laundry to cleaning surfaces and organizing spaces, home robots could alleviate the burden of everyday housework. Meal Preparation: Imagine robots capable of following recipes, preparing ingredients, and even cooking meals, freeing up your time and simplifying daily routines. Assistance for the Elderly: As populations age, humanoid robots could provide invaluable support for older adults, helping them maintain independence at home for longer. This could range from mobility assistance to medication reminders and emergency support. From Factory Floors to Living Rooms: The Robotics Journey While the allure of home robots is strong, the initial focus for most robotics companies, including Figure, has been on industrial applications. Why the detour to factories and warehouses first? Lucrative Industrial Deployment: The immediate financial returns in industrial settings are more attractive. Factories and warehouses offer structured environments where robots can perform repetitive tasks, increasing efficiency and productivity. Controlled Environments: Industrial settings are generally more predictable and safer than homes. This allows for easier testing and deployment of early-stage robotics technology. Willing Early Adopters: Companies like BMW, where Figure is piloting its systems, are willing to invest in testing and implementing robotics solutions to optimize their operations. This industrial phase is seen as a crucial stepping stone. Gaining experience and refining the technology in controlled environments like factories paves the way for the more complex and nuanced challenges of deploying humanoid robots in homes. The Unique Challenges of Home Robotics Bringing robotics into our homes is a different ballgame compared to factories. Homes are wonderfully diverse and, let’s face it, often messy! Here are some key hurdles: Challenge Description Variability: Every home is unique in layout, furniture, lighting, and clutter. Robots need to adapt to endless variations. Unpredictability: Homes are dynamic environments with people, pets, and unexpected events. Robots must navigate unpredictable situations safely and effectively. Affordability: Consumer robotics must be priced competitively to be adopted widely. Balancing advanced capabilities with affordability is crucial. Safety: Home robots must be absolutely safe to operate around humans, children, and pets. Safety protocols and fail-safes are paramount. User Experience: Robots need to be easy to use and integrate seamlessly into daily life. Intuitive interfaces and reliable performance are essential for user adoption. While Figure’s 2025 “ alpha testing ” designation implies very early-stage trials, it’s a significant leap forward. It signals that the era of home robots is inching closer, driven by advancements in AI and the relentless pursuit of innovative companies like Figure AI. What Does This Mean for the Future? Figure’s ambitious timeline for home robots , fueled by their Helix VLA model, is a clear indication of the rapid progress in the field. While widespread adoption is still some years away, the prospect of humanoid robots assisting us in our homes is becoming increasingly tangible. This development has far-reaching implications: Enhanced Quality of Life: Home robots have the potential to free up our time, reduce stress from mundane chores, and provide valuable assistance, especially for the elderly and those with mobility limitations. New Industries and Job Creation: The rise of home robotics will spawn new industries focused on robot development, maintenance, software, and related services, creating new job opportunities. Societal Impact: As robotics becomes more integrated into our lives, it will raise important societal questions about ethics, privacy, and the evolving relationship between humans and machines. Figure AI’s push towards home robots is more than just technological advancement; it’s a glimpse into a future where technology seamlessly integrates into our homes, transforming how we live and interact with our surroundings. Keep an eye on Figure – they might just be shaping the next frontier of domestic life.

Provider Account/Details: You might be redirected to the chosen provider’s interface (or an embedded window) to link your existing account or create a new one. This is where you’ll provide payment details for receiving fiat currency. KYC Verification (if needed): If it’s your first time using the provider or for larger amounts, you might be prompted to complete KYC verification as required by regulations. Confirm and Execute: Review all transaction details, including fees and exchange rates, and confirm the off-ramp transaction within the Uniswap Wallet. Transaction Processing: The chosen provider will process the conversion and initiate the fiat currency transfer to your specified payment method. Processing times vary depending on the provider and payment method. Potential Challenges and Things to Keep in Mind While this update is incredibly positive, it’s important to be aware of potential challenges and considerations: Fees: Off-ramping services always involve fees. Be sure to compare fees across providers and understand the fee structure before initiating a transaction. Fees can include transaction fees, exchange rate markups, and payment processing fees. Regulatory Compliance (KYC/AML): Fiat off-ramping is subject to regulatory scrutiny. Expect to undergo KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) verification processes with the chosen provider. This is a standard practice to comply with financial regulations. Geographic Restrictions: The availability of specific providers and fiat currencies may be limited by geographic location and regulatory restrictions. Confirm that the service is available in your region. Exchange Rate Fluctuations: Cryptocurrency prices are volatile. The exchange rate at the time of initiating the off-ramp transaction might differ slightly from the rate when the transaction is fully processed. Be mindful of potential fluctuations, especially for larger transactions. Security: While Uniswap Wallet is self-custodial, you are still interacting with third-party providers for fiat off-ramping. Ensure you are using reputable providers and practice good security hygiene when managing your accounts and transactions. The Future of DeFi and Fiat Accessibility Uniswap Wallet’s integration of fiat currency exchange is a significant step forward for the DeFi space. It addresses a critical pain point for many users – the often-complex process of moving between the crypto and traditional financial systems. By simplifying crypto to fiat conversions, Uniswap is contributing to: Mainstream Adoption: Making crypto more user-friendly and accessible is crucial for wider adoption. Fiat off-ramping removes a significant barrier for newcomers and casual users. Real-World Utility: This feature enhances the real-world utility of cryptocurrencies. It becomes easier to use crypto earnings for everyday expenses, making them more practical in daily life. DeFi Ecosystem Growth: As DeFi becomes more integrated with traditional finance, it fosters a more robust and interconnected financial ecosystem. Fiat on/off-ramps are essential infrastructure for this growth. Conclusion: Embracing a Seamless Crypto-Fiat Future The introduction of fiat off-ramping in the Uniswap Wallet is a revolutionary development. It marks a significant leap towards bridging the gap between the decentralized world of crypto and the traditional financial system. By partnering with established providers like Robinhood, Transak, and MoonPay, Uniswap is empowering users with unprecedented convenience and control over their crypto assets. This update not only simplifies the user experience but also paves the way for greater mainstream adoption and real-world application of cryptocurrencies. As the DeFi space continues to evolve, features like seamless fiat off-ramping will be instrumental in shaping a more accessible and user-centric financial future.

But don’t worry, this isn’t a retreat, but a bold leap forward! Get ready for TikTok One, a groundbreaking platform supercharged with cutting-edge AI tools , poised to redefine how brands and content creators collaborate. For those in the crypto and blockchain space, understanding these social media evolutions is crucial as marketing strategies increasingly blend with online content creation. Let’s dive into what this powerful transition means for the future of digital engagement. Why is TikTok Replacing the Creator Marketplace with TikTok One? TikTok’s Creator Marketplace, while functional, was somewhat limited in scope. Think of it as a first-generation solution. TikTok One , on the other hand, is envisioned as a comprehensive ecosystem. The move signals TikTok’s ambition to provide a more integrated and intelligent suite of tools for businesses and content creators . Here’s a breakdown of the key reasons behind this upgrade: Enhanced Functionality: Creator Marketplace was primarily a directory to connect brands and creators. TikTok One expands this to offer a broader range of services, including trend analysis, creative inspiration, and AI-driven content creation tools. AI-Powered Intelligence: The core differentiator is the deep integration of artificial intelligence. TikTok One leverages AI to offer intelligent assistance in script generation, video editing, ad optimization, and more – features absent in the original marketplace. Streamlined Workflow: By consolidating various tools and resources into a single platform, TikTok aims to simplify the campaign creation and management process for both brands and creators. Future-Proofing for Social Media Marketing: This move reflects the growing importance of AI in digital marketing. TikTok is positioning itself at the forefront of this evolution, offering tools that are not just current but also future-ready. Essentially, TikTok is moving from a simple matchmaking service to a sophisticated, AI-enhanced creative and social media marketing hub. Unpacking the Power of TikTok One’s AI Tools The real excitement around TikTok One lies in its arsenal of AI tools . These aren’t just gimmicks; they are designed to genuinely enhance the creative process and marketing effectiveness. Let’s explore some of the standout AI-driven features: Symphony Assistant: Your AI Co-Pilot for TikTok Creativity Imagine having an AI assistant specifically tailored for TikTok content creation. That’s precisely what Symphony Assistant offers. This feature helps users: Summarize Trends: Quickly grasp trending topics and themes on TikTok, ensuring your content stays relevant and timely.

Intelligent Ad Optimization: Receive AI-driven suggestions to refine and enhance ad performance, maximizing ROI. Script Generator: Develop TikTok video scripts for ads by simply providing product details, industry information, and other relevant inputs. What Happens to Existing Creator Marketplace Data? TikTok understands the importance of data continuity. Ahead of the Creator Marketplace shutdown, they are actively encouraging advertisers to migrate their valuable data. Here’s what you need to know about the transition process: Data Migration Encouraged: TikTok is urging users to transfer data from the Creator Marketplace and the TikTok Creative Challenge dashboard to TikTok One. Seamless Transition: The goal is to make the migration as smooth as possible, ensuring minimal disruption for ongoing campaigns and creator relationships. Preparation is Key: Advertisers should proactively take steps to migrate their data to ensure they can continue their activities seamlessly on TikTok One. The Benefits of TikTok One for Brands and Creators This transition to TikTok One is packed with potential benefits for both brands and content creators .

Enhanced Creativity: AI assistance can spark new ideas and push creative boundaries, leading to more innovative and impactful campaigns. Improved ROI: Smarter ad optimization and more targeted content creation can translate to better campaign performance and a higher return on investment. Data-Driven Decisions: Access to trend tracking and performance analytics within TikTok One allows for more informed and strategic marketing decisions. For Content Creators: Expanded Opportunities: TikTok One’s broader scope may lead to more diverse and lucrative collaboration opportunities with brands. Creative Empowerment: AI tools can assist creators in refining their content, experimenting with new formats, and enhancing their production quality. Streamlined Collaboration: A centralized platform simplifies the process of connecting with brands, managing campaigns, and accessing resources.

The bill is designed to address ethical concerns over conflicts of interest and the use of public office for personal gain. Although the proposal faces steep political challenges, it sparks a broader debate on transparency and accountability in digital finance. The discussion reflects growing calls for clearer regulatory boundaries in a market where politics and cryptocurrency increasingly intersect. ABC News reported Thursday that House Democrats are preparing new legislation. Led by Congressman Sam Liccardo (D-CA), they plan to introduce the Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement (MEME) Act. The bill would bar senior U.S. officials and their family members from issuing, sponsoring, or endorsing digital assets, securities, futures, and commodities—specifically in response to President Donald Trump’s recent involvement with the $TRUMP meme coin. Details of the MEME Act According to the February 27 report , Liccardo and his Democratic Party constituents plan to introduce the Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement (MEME) Act, which would prohibit top U.S. officials and their family members from profiting off cryptocurrencies. Let’s make corruption criminal again. #SipWithSam #MEMEAct pic.twitter.com/J4sRcMdXv0 — Rep. Sam Liccardo (@RepLiccardo) February 27, 2025 The MEME Act is unlikely to pass in the current Republican-controlled Congress. However, its prospects could improve if Democrats retake control in the 2026 midterm elections, potentially forcing Trump to return any profits from his namesake cryptocurrency. “Let’s make corruption criminal again,” Liccardo told reporter John Parkinson. “Our public offices belong to the public, not the officeholders—nor should they leverage their political authority for financial gain.” “The Trumps’ issuance of meme coins financially exploits the public for personal gain, and raises the specter of insider trading and foreign influence over the Executive Branch,” he added. Donald Trump Faces Meme Coin Criticism The meme coin $TRUMP debuted just days before the U.S. presidential inauguration, launching alongside $MELANIA, a token tied to now-First Lady Melania Trump. Shortly after its release, $TRUMP surged to over $74 before experiencing a sharp decline, mirroring the drop in the value of $MELANIA. According to CoinGecko , $TRUMP is down 82 percent from its all-time high last month, while $MELANIA has fallen by 93 percent. The U.S. President and First Lady have previously launched branded NFTs , continuing their involvement in Web3. Despite Trump’s crypto-friendly regulatory stance, the Trumps’ meme coins have faced criticism online and in political circles due to substantial investor losses. “Last cycle we had NFTs, so Trump sold NFTs. This cycle we have meme coins,” Variant Fund CLO Jake Chervinsky said in a January 2025 X post. “Is $TRUMP seriously a surprise to you?” Restoring Confidence in Public Service Trust in governance depends heavily on separating personal gain from political authority—a line increasingly blurred by crypto-related ventures like $TRUMP. Though Liccardo’s MEME Act faces an uphill battle, its introduction itself highlights a pressing dilemma: How much influence should politicians wield in speculative digital markets? The answer will shape not just cryptocurrency policy but the credibility of democratic institutions. Ultimately, preserving public confidence may require decisive action far beyond symbolic legislation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What ethical concerns does the proposed bill raise? The measure highlights worries about public officials potentially using their office to secure personal financial benefits through digital tokens. Such a mix of public duty and private profit could erode trust in government decision-making and blur the lines of accountability. How might restricting political involvement in meme coins affect the cryptocurrency market? By limiting political figures from endorsing or profiting from meme coins, the proposal could reduce market volatility driven by speculative hype and conflict of interest. However, some observers argue that the impact might be largely symbolic given the challenging legislative environment. Are there alternative approaches to managing conflicts of interest in political finance related to digital assets? Experts suggest that, aside from outright bans, enhanced disclosure requirements and independent oversight mechanisms could offer a path to greater transparency. These alternatives might help ensure that personal financial interests do not compromise public service, fostering a more accountable framework. What potential impact could this legislation have on public trust in government? If elected officials are seen to profit from speculative digital assets, public confidence in their commitment to serving the common good may decline. This concern fuels calls for reform, as maintaining clear boundaries between public duty and personal enrichment is essential for democratic legitimacy. How does this legislative effort fit into the larger context of cryptocurrency regulation? The proposal reflects a broader debate about the need for regulatory clarity in digital markets. By targeting practices that merge political power with speculative investments, the measure may serve as a precursor to more comprehensive rules designed to ensure that emerging financial technologies operate with greater ethical oversight.

A new bill aims to prevent top government officials, including the president, from issuing or endorsing cryptocurrencies, following concerns over the recent decline of the $TRUMP meme coin.

As investors hunt for the next big opportunity, RCOF is positioning itself as a revolutionary force in decentralized finance, offering cutting-edge technology and investor-friendly features that set it apart. The Unmatched Appeal of RCO Finance (RCOF) RCO Finance (RCOF) has captured the attention of seasoned traders and institutional investors thanks to its innovative ecosystem designed for efficiency and profitability. Unlike many other altcoins, RCOF introduces an AI-powered robo advisor that revolutionizes investment strategies. This advanced tool analyzes real-time market trends and applies machine learning to identify high-potential assets before they take off. Its predictive capabilities ensure that RCOF investors stay ahead of the curve, making it one of the top altcoins to hold in the coming months. Beyond AI-driven trading, RCOF offers unparalleled accessibility. The platform’s no-KYC policy ensures privacy-focused transactions, making it a go-to choice for investors who value anonymity. Security remains a top priority, with comprehensive smart contract audits conducted by the reputable blockchain security firm SolidProof.

Investors gain exposure to over 120,000 tradable instruments, including tokenized real-world assets such as real estate, commodities, stocks, and bonds. This diversification allows RCOF holders to mitigate risks while maximizing their investment potential, further solidifying its position as one of the top altcoins to hold in March 2025.

These features make RCO Finance more than just another altcoin; it’s a comprehensive investment solution that caters to both short-term traders and long-term investors. RCOF incorporates deflationary mechanisms designed to enhance its value over time. The platform actively burns unsold tokens during its presale stages, reducing overall supply. This strategic approach boosts long-term price appreciation, making it a standout option among the top altcoins to hold in 2025. Recent developments have only added to RCOF’s momentum. The platform’s beta launch was met with overwhelming enthusiasm, attracting over 10,000 new users. With its upcoming alpha release, RCO Finance plans to introduce additional enhancements, including an advanced monitoring tool for its AI Robo Advisor.

So far, over $13.5 million has been raised, with the next price phase at $0.13 rapidly approaching. Investors who secure their positions now benefit from significant price appreciation upon listing. Market analysts project that RCOF could trade between $0.40 and $0.60 post-listing, presenting an ROI of over 800% for early adopters. Some forecasts even anticipate a 19,000% price surge, elevating RCOF to the ranks of the most profitable altcoins in recent history. Furthermore, RCOF holders gain access to exclusive perks, including AI-powered analytics, DeFi lending services, trading fee discounts, and governance rights within the ecosystem.

There’s a direct line from the efficient markets theory of Eugene Fama in the 1960s to modern portfolio theory. It paved the way for index funds, a strategy that has not only weathered market cycles but also become the default for managing pensions and retirement accounts. As we step into a new era of digital finance, tokenized assets may offer a way to broaden our investment horizons in ways that traditional models have overlooked. The genesis of modern portfolio theory Index fund investing didn’t arise by chance. In the early 1970s, amid vigorous debates over market efficiency, Burton Malkiel’s seminal work advocating index funds in 1973 (in his book “A Random Walk Down Wall Street” ) was embodied in John Bogle’s launch of the Vanguard S&P 500 fund in 1975. This cemented a strategy that focused on broad diversification and minimal trading. Astonishingly, passive index-investing has triumphed around the world, even though the theory underpinning it, that investors are always rational, hasn’t held up well. Behavioral psychologists like Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky illuminated the flaws in our decision-making processes. This is highlighted in Daniel Kahneman’s award winning book, “Thinking Fast and Slow.” In the ensuing decades, economists have reconciled efficient markets and irrational behavior into the concept of “pretty good markets.” Aggregated wisdom in the form of prices trends towards being right, over time, though from day to day and case to case there are significant gaps that investors can exploit. Index funds have held up well because exploiting those opportunities is hard to do consistently or cheaply. At the same time, the regulatory framework governing institutional investing reinforces this reliance on proven strategies. Fund managers operate under strict fiduciary duties that require them to prioritize client interests and mitigate risk. As a result, they allocate the bulk of their portfolios to assets with long, established track records, typically government bonds and passive equity funds. In short, the criteria for “acceptable” investments aren’t driven solely by potential returns; they are fundamentally tied to data history, reliability, and transparency. In case you were wondering, that means index funds. In this environment, venturing into uncharted territory is not taken lightly. New asset classes, no matter how promising, are initially sidelined because they lack the long-term, daily data that makes them viable for inclusion in a fiduciary portfolio. Until now, almost all portfolio theory has been based on U.S. equities and government bonds. Although that universe has expanded over time to include index funds and bonds from other large economies, it still represents only a relatively small portion of the world’s assets. Portfolios are constrained at the intersection of regulations and data. And that’s all going to change. Tokenization: Expanding the universe of investable assets Tokenization and on-chain transactions don’t just offer a scalable way to package any kind of asset. They also offer a path to transparent, comparable data on asset values. By representing real-world assets, whether it’s Thai real estate, Nigerian oil leases, or New York taxi medallions as digital tokens on a blockchain, we can begin to generate the kind of daily, market-derived data that has traditionally been reserved for a narrow set of assets. Consider a simple question: How much Thai real estate should feature in a diversified retirement portfolio? Under current models, the answer is obscured by a lack of reliable, continuous pricing data. But if Thai real estate were tokenized, establishing an on-chain market with daily closing prices, it could eventually be measured against the same metrics used for U.S. equities. In time, this would force a re-examination of the static, index-based approach that has dominated investment strategy for so long. The implications for global finance Right now, alternative strategies – as pension fund managers refer to anything that isn’t a stock or bond index – comprise no more than 15–20% of most funds. Changing academic data on investment options would put the other 80% up for grabs. Imagine a future where a truly diversified portfolio isn’t limited by the confines of traditional equity and debt markets. With tokenization, investors from large institutional funds to individual savers could gain exposure to asset classes and geographic regions previously ignored due to data scarcity or illiquidity. The principles that underpin modern portfolio theory wouldn’t be discarded. Rather, they would be expanded upon to include a broader range of risk and return profiles. As tokenized assets build track records, fiduciaries, who today favor the predictability of bonds and index funds, might find themselves compelled to recalibrate their strategies. It’s not that the pretty good market hypothesis will be rendered obsolete. Instead, the parameters of what constitutes “efficient” may widen considerably. A richer dataset could lead to better-informed risk assessments and, ultimately, to portfolios that capture a more accurate picture of global value. A Measured but inevitable shift This isn’t going to happen overnight. The fastest we’re likely to see changes emerge is about a decade, assuming time to build a wide portfolio of tokenized assets and 5-7 years to build a daily information track record. Once the data is present, however, change could come quickly, thanks to widespread use of artificial intelligence. One thing that often slows the spread of change is a lack of intellectual bandwidth on the part of fund managers and consumers to adapt to new data. It took about 40 years to move pension fund investors from a 95%+ bonds model in the 1950s to a majority equity index fund model in the 1990s. It took about 30 years for index funds to become the dominant equity investment vehicle after the evidence showed they were the best option. In a world of AI-driven automated investment tools, the transition might happen a whole lot faster. And with hundreds of trillions of dollars in assets under management, every percentage point change in allocation strategy is a little tsunami of change by itself.

The feature is facilitated through integrations with MoonPay, Robinhood, and Transak. This development will simplify the conversion of digital assets into fiat currency, improving accessibility for users in over 180 countries. Uniswap Labs Integrates Robinhood, MoonPay for Crypto-to-Bank Transfers In a recent post on X, Uniswap Labs announced the rollout of its fiat off-ramp feature, enabling users to convert crypto holdings into cash and withdraw funds directly into their bank accounts. This service is integrated with Robinhood, MoonPay, and Transak, providing a streamlined process for users looking to move between crypto and traditional finance. The new off-ramp is available in over 180 countries, broadening UNI platform’s global reach. The feature is accessible through the Uniswap wallet on both iOS and Android. More so, there are plans to extend support to the UNI platform browser extension and website. By integrating with multiple fiat on-ramp providers, Uniswap Labs will offer a flexible way for users to manage crypto transfers. Users can swap supported ERC-20 tokens, including USDC and ETH, before withdrawing their converted funds to bank accounts. According to Uniswap, the process is designed to be completed in seconds, reducing delays commonly associated with crypto-to-bank transfers. The integration with Robinhood, MoonPay, and Transak ensures broad coverage across different regions, increasing accessibility. This move comes just days after the US SEC dropped its Uniswap case, marking another shift in the regulator’s approach to the crypto industry. The UNI platform stated that the case closure reaffirms its compliance with federal laws and its commitment to a transparency. Expansion of Features With Unichain The fiat off-ramp follows the UNI platform recent introduction of Uniswap v4 and Unichain, a Layer 2 network designed to improve scalability. These updates will offer users more efficient trading and transaction capabilities. Uniswap v4 introduces customizable hooks, which allow developers to create more efficient trading strategies on the platform. Meanwhile, Unichain Layer 2 is expected to reduce gas fees and improve transaction speeds, boosting UNI price with new technologies. Uniswap Labs move comes as other crypto wallets, such as MetaMask, expand their fiat off-ramp services. MetaMask recently integrated with Transak to support fiat withdrawals across multiple blockchains. This reflects a growing trend among DeFi platforms to bridge the gap between crypto and traditional banking.

However, it faces its toughest challenge amidst falling network activity and a price slump. According to an analyst, Dogecoin experienced a massive 95% drop in active addresses on its network, suggesting a considerable decline in activity.

As Dogecoin’s price starts to recover, its network activity suffered. Crypto expert Ali Martinez notes the decline in the network activity, sharing that the drop in the number of active addresses began three months ago. According to Martinez, the Dogecoin network registered 1,292,770 new active addresses by November 21st, 2024. The number soon surged to 2.4 million active addresses, but this number immediately dropped. Between December 2024 and February 2025, the number of addresses dropped by around 95%. Meanwhile, Dogecoin’s price has declined substantially in the last few days, with holders incurring losses. The popular meme coin is currently trading at $0.2077, a slight improvement from its $0.1977 price a few hours ago. Despite DOGE’s minimal gains, it’s still down from last week’s performance. Drop In Network Activity On February 23rd, it was noted that the network only had 30,815 new addresses, confirming the slide in network activity. The decrease in Dogecoin’s network activity was reflected in its price movement, which dipped from $0.4868 to $0.196. With price dipping and a decline in network activity, many commentators argued it’s a sign of weak demand for Dogecoin. According to one data, there’s a 2.67% decline in the percentage of long-term Dogecoin investors, which means a less accumulation. Also, there’s a drop of 11.81% in mid-term coin holders, meaning they have already exited their positions. Finally, the data indicates a 107.45% increase in short-term holders, which suggests an increase in speculative trading. This information shows that Dogecoin traders are more interested in short-term and speculative trading activities than long-term investment. DOGE is starting its big move!

Whales Buy 530 Million DOGE appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Amid the ongoing bearish price momentum, Dogecoin (DOGE), the largest and most popular meme coin, has been gaining significant attention from crypto enthusiasts due to its notable price drop in recent days. Crypto Whales Buy 530 Million DOGE On February 28, 2025, a prominent crypto expert shared a post on X (formerly Twitter), revealing that during the past three days of DOGE’s price decline, whales have bought the dip, accumulating a significant 530 million DOGE. https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1895217845186724299 DOGE’s on-chain data shows that it has experienced a price drop of over 17% during the period when whales bought the dip. It appears that they began accumulating after the breakdown of the crucial support level at $0.238. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Action and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, DOGE appears bearish but has been consolidating in a tight range near the crucial support level of $0.175 for the past two trading days. Based on recent price action and historical patterns, DOGE still seems bearish and could drop another 15% in the future. Source: Trading View As of now, the asset is trading below the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe, indicating a downtrend. Current Price Momentum and Decline of Open Interest DOGE is currently trading near $0.206 and has experienced a modest price surge of over 1.75% in the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, its trading volume dropped by 30%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors, possibly due to the significant price fluctuations the meme coin has witnessed in recent days. With the bearish market outlook, data from the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass revealed that intraday and derivative traders appear to be abandoning DOGE, as its futures open interest (OI) has dropped to its lowest level in 2025.

The meme coin market is boiling with action, and traders are scrambling to get in before the next explosion. Apu Apustaja (APU) is feeling the heat, dropping 22.29% in the past week, despite a 7.27% increase in trading volume. Meanwhile, Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) is making waves, climbing 10.26% in just seven days, catching the attention of meme coin degens. But the real spotlight is on BTFD Coin (BTFD), where whales are aping in fast thanks to its 90% APY staking rewards and a massive 3650% ROI potential. With a presale tally of $6.21M and over 11,100 holders, BTFD Coin is dominating the meme coin conversation. Let’s break down why this meme-fueled rocket might be the best meme coin to buy today . BTFD Coin (BTFD) – 90% APY Staking and a 3650% ROI Potential Why are investors rushing to grab BTFD before it moons? Simple—this isn’t just another meme coin, it’s a whole movement. The Bulls Squad, now over 11,100 strong, is laser-focused on staking rewards, play-to-earn (P2E) gaming, and a 3650% ROI moonshot. It’s no wonder why BTFD Coin is dominating discussions as the best meme coin to buy today. The 90% APY staking feature is a game-changer. Investors aren’t just holding BTFD; they’re multiplying their stacks at an insane rate. Staking offers passive income, meaning even before the price skyrockets post-listing, holders are raking in rewards. Now, let’s talk numbers. If an investor drops $2,000 into BTFD at the current presale price of $0.00016, they’d be holding 12.5 million BTFD tokens. Once BTFD hits $0.0006 at listing, that bag would be worth $7,500—nearly 4x the investment before even factoring in staking rewards. And if BTFD blasts to its projected $0.006 moon price, that’s a 3650% ROI, turning $2,000 into a jaw-dropping $75,000. It’s easy to secure BTFD before the presale price jumps. Set up MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load it with BNB, ETH, or USDT, and head to the presale page . Enter the amount of BTFD you want, apply the 100% BONUS CODE (LAUNCH100) to double your tokens, confirm the purchase, and boom—you’re officially part of the Bulls Squad. But here’s where it gets even crazier: BTFD skipped Stage 13, burning all unsold tokens. With a tightening supply and skyrocketing demand, this presale is heating up fast. If you’re still on the sidelines, now’s the time to act—this is hands down the best meme coin to buy today. Apu Apustaja (APU) Sees Volume Surge Despite Price Drop Apu Apustaja, the Pepe-variant meme coin, has had a rough week, dropping 22.29%. However, its trading volume has jumped 7.27%, showing that traders are still keeping an eye on it. Despite its price dip, Apu Apustaja has a loyal community of investors who believe in its long-term value. Unlike low-effort meme coins that get rugged, APU’s fully transparent and fairly launched nature has kept holders engaged. With its fair launch philosophy and organic meme appeal, Apu Apustaja remains a wild card in the meme coin space. Whether it bounces back or consolidates further will depend on its next market moves and how its community rallies. Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) Pumps 10.26% and Gains Market Momentum Fartcoin might have started as a joke, but its recent performance is no laughing matter. The coin has seen a 10.26% price surge in just one week, backed by a 0.76% increase in trading volume. Built on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain, Fartcoin has been picking up steam in the DEX space, where traders are swapping it aggressively. Some early adopters are already seeing solid gains, making it one of the most talked-about meme coins this week. Fartcoin’s real strength lies in its growing trader base and memetic power. As long as it keeps its momentum, it could remain a trending pick for meme coin degens looking for short-term flips. The Final Thoughts Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin stands out as the best meme coin to buy today. While Apu Apustaja battles price volatility and Fartcoin gains short-term traction, BTFD’s 90% APY staking and 3650% ROI potential make it the most compelling investment opportunity right now. The Stage 14 price of $0.00016 won’t last much longer, and with BTFD set to list at $0.0006, this is the perfect dip to buy before it takes off. The 100% BONUS CODE (LAUNCH100) won’t be around forever—this is a limited-time chance to double your tokens and secure a front-row seat for BTFD’s moon mission.

33767162,[object Object],1740704404,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Dogecoin Price Gears Up For 75% Rally As Long As It Stays Inside This Channel,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-gears-up-a-rally/,"Crypto analyst Olivier has provided a bullish outlook for the Dogecoin price amid the market downtrend, which has led to a massive decline for DOGE. The analyst predicts that the foremost meme coin could be gearing up for a 75% rally, which could send its price above $0.3. Dogecoin Price Gears Up For 75% Rally If It Stays Inside This Channel In an X post , crypto analyst Olivier predicted that the Dogecoin price could enjoy a 75% rally as long as it stays within a parallel channel, which he highlighted on his accompanying chart. Alluding to DOGE’s monthly chart , the analyst asserted that the trend for the foremost meme coin is clear as long as it stays inside the channel. This 75% rally for the Dogecoin price could just be the start, as the analyst assured that the uptrend will resume above $0.3350. His accompanying chart showed that the foremost meme coin could rally to a new all-time high (ATH) and even hit $6 in this market cycle. Based on the chart, DOGE could also reach $30 as it rallies to the upper boundary of this channel. In the meantime, as the analyst suggests, the Dogecoin price needs to hold above the lower boundary of this boundary. The accompanying chart shows that a break below $0.15 could invalidate this bullish setup for DOGE. Given the current downtrend in the broader crypto market, the foremost meme coin is still at risk of dropping to this price level. Crypto analyst David Perk recently predicted that the Dogecoin price could crash further to $0.15. However, the analyst expects DOGE to bounce from that price level, which is still bullish for the meme coin. Staying above $0.15 still puts DOGE within this channel, which could send its price to new ATHs. DOGE To $10 Still In Play Meanwhile, amid the market downtrend, crypto analyst DOGECAPITAL has reaffirmed that the Dogecoin price could still rally to as high as $10 in this market cycle. The analyst highlighted the price action of the previous two cycles to explain why the meme coin could reach this level and even rally above it. He indicated that the current price action was mirroring that of the previous two cycles and that the Dogecoin price was about to start the second phase of its parabolic rally. DOGECAPITAL expects DOGE to hold around $0.20 on the weekly timeframe. The analyst added that once this consolidatioin is complete, Dogecoin could move towards $1.70. The rally to this level is then expected to pave the way for the third phase of the parabolic move which would send the foremost meme coin to $10 and above. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.2, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",Dogecoin|Coinmarketcap|Consolidation Phase|David Perk|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|DOGECAPITAL|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|meme coin|Olivier|Parallel Channel,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-02-28 01:00:04

Founding members of HumanAIx include: OORT, Neo, Storj, Oasis Protocol, YGG, io.net, XYO, AI.KIDO, DeTaSECURE, Unyt, Holo, Valdi, Supermoon. As AI advances rapidly, the three core pillars of AI development—compute, storage, and data—continue to face significant challenges including high costs, energy consumption, scalability limitations, and centralization, which restrict accessibility and efficiency. On the storage side, handling large data volumes and associated transfer costs continues to be a challenge. Meanwhile, data acquisition often raises ethical and legal concerns, with frequent violations of privacy rights. Data labeling further exacerbates the issue, relying on underpaid workers in poor working conditions, creating serious human rights concerns. Additionally, individuals who contribute data rarely receive fair compensation or incentives. Overcoming these challenges is important for the industry's long-term sustainability and ethical development. HumanAIx is an open protocol that seamlessly connects partners—each contributing critical components such as validation, storage, compute, and data—to create a decentralized AI infrastructure that is permissionless, scalable, and verifiable. It is built on a three-layer architecture, consisting of an interface layer, a protocol layer (which integrates compute, storage, and data), and a security layer. This initiative harnesses industry expertise and knowledge to collaboratively build an open environment for the future of decentralized AI. ""We believe AI should create more benefits than constraints for humanity. With the launch of HumanAIx, we are fostering a decentralized movement to ensure AI remains human-centric and serves the broader community,"" said Michael Robinson, Chairman of OORT Foundation. ""We are thrilled to collaborate with like-minded visionaries and excited to develop initiatives that better serve the AI community, ultimately building a truly human-centric ecosystem."" ""At Neo, we believe that a decentralized, interoperable future is key to unlocking AI’s full potential. By joining HumanAIx, we are contributing to an open, verifiable AI infrastructure that empowers developers and businesses alike—one that is transparent, scalable, and accessible to all,"" said John Wang, Head of Neo Ecosystem Growth. “This HumanAIx marks a significant milestone in democratising access to high-quality AI models and incentivising human contribution in AI. By combining OORT’s robust infrastructure with our security expertise at DeTaSECURE and EigenLayer’s innovative restaking mechanism, we’re creating an ecosystem that ensures transparency, reliability and economic sustainability in AI industry.”said Tamaghna Basu, Founder, CEO & CTO of DeTaSECURE. ""The future of AI depends on diverse, high-quality human input, and YGG is joining HumanAIx to ensure that AI is built with—and for—real people. By empowering a global community to refine and enhance AI data in a decentralized way, we’re creating new opportunities for digital work while keeping AI open, fair, and aligned with human interests."" said Beryl Li, Co-Founder of YGG. ""At XYO, we are driven by the vision of blending blockchain, data and AI to unlock human potential in meaningful ways. HumanAIx offers a unique opportunity to foster collaboration and build systems that prioritize fairness, authenticity, and real-world impact while ensuring data integrity. We’re proud to join forces with forward-thinking partners to shape a future where technology amplifies human agency and innovation thrives."" said Markus Levin, XYO Co-Founder. “While everyone is just talking about ‘Bring AI to people’, ‘Make Web3 AI truly decentralized’, HumanAIx has a real impact by uniting the brightest minds of the web3 AI sector. By stepping into this alliance with AI.KIDO we're significantly boosting our efforts to put the responsibility for AI markets into the hands of real people.” said Pavlo Karapinka, Co-Founder of AI.KIDO. “We are impressed with the collaborative and human-centric approach to AI taken by HumanAIx.

While institutional investors are increasingly backing Bitcoin, not every investor is focused solely on BTC for substantial returns. Yet, not all investors are focusing on BTC— Web3Bay is quickly becoming the center of attention. While Bitcoin leads the market, Web3Bay’s rise is stealing the spotlight. The decentralized e-commerce platform raised $200,000 within 24 hours, marking a milestone in its presale. With rapid sales and a unique Web3 model, Web3Bay stands out as one of the top altcoins to buy now, showing massive potential in 2025. Bitcoin’s Gains Strength With Strategy₿’s Bullish Bet Bitcoin’s jump above $95,000 marks a solid comeback after losses caused by the LIBRA coin crash, which erased $4.4 billion in market value. Despite setbacks, Bitcoin remains the strongest crypto, with institutions rapidly increasing their holdings. On February 18, 2025, Michael Saylor, executive chairman of Strategy₿ (formerly MicroStrategy), revealed the company’s $2 billion private offering. Raised through convertible senior notes due in 2030, the funds will buy more Bitcoin and support long-term growth. Saylor highlighted Bitcoin’s growing role in corporate finance, comparing its value to high-end real estate. He noted that Bitcoin is no longer just a speculative asset but a core part of Strategy₿’s expansion strategy, even using BTC as collateral for new projects. With institutions strengthening their Bitcoin positions, analysts see this as a signal of long-term growth, suggesting that the current dip offers a chance to buy. However, as Bitcoin’s growth slows, many retail investors are turning to Web3Bay for faster gains. Web3Bay Raises $200K in 24 Hours— Is it the Next Market Giant? While Bitcoin rebounds, Web3Bay is capturing attention with its rapid growth. The decentralized e-commerce platform raised over $200,000 in a single day, pushing its presale total past $1.5 million as buyers rush to secure early-stage gains. Web3Bay aims to transform online shopping by cutting out middlemen, lowering costs, and giving users full control over their transactions. Unlike Amazon, eBay, and Shopify, which charge high fees and control user data, Web3Bay offers direct blockchain-based transactions. This real-world use case is fueling Web3Bay’s fast-selling presale. As interest in decentralized commerce grows, Web3Bay is positioned to lead the market. Now in Stage 4 of its presale, the 3BAY coin is priced at $0.004562. With each stage bringing a price increase, early buyers are locking in gains before the next jump. The rising demand and fast funding suggest Web3Bay could become one of the biggest success stories of the next bull run. Why Smart Investors Are Choosing Web3Bay Bitcoin remains a strong choice for long-term growth, but its large market cap limits its speed. While institutional adoption boosts its stability, it doesn’t offer the rapid gains that retail investors seek. This is why many are turning to Web3Bay, which offers both real-world use and high early-stage growth potential. First, Web3Bay’s presale gives buyers a chance to enter at low prices before demand drives up the cost. Unlike Bitcoin, which has already reached a trillion-dollar market cap, Web3Bay is still in its growth phase, offering more room for fast gains. Second, Web3Bay is solving real industry challenges, unlike short-lived meme coins. With more people seeking decentralized shopping, demand for 3BAY coins is expected to rise as the platform grows. Lastly, Bitcoin’s biggest gains are in the past, while Web3Bay is just beginning. Early Bitcoin buyers made life-changing profits, and Web3Bay now offers a similar early-stage opportunity. Time to Take Decision! Bitcoin’s rebound and Strategy₿’s $2 billion purchase show that institutional support for crypto is still strong. But for faster short-term gains, Web3Bay is emerging as a top choice. With $200,000 raised in 24 hours and a presale total above $1.5 million, Web3Bay is growing faster than most new projects in 2025. While Bitcoin is well-established, Web3Bay’s early phase gives buyers the best chance to lock in big returns before prices climb further. The next breakout crypto is here—get in before Web3Bay’s crypto presale stages sell out.

Alex Krüger tells his 206,800 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin’s latest severe correction is similar to when the flagship crypto asset collapsed to range lows in April 2024 before printing a series of rallies. However, he warns that the uncertainty around US President Donald Trump’s tariff polices remains a big risk for the crypto markets. “The dominant mood across crypto market participants is ‘it is over.’ For good reason. The Bitcoin dip is large, yet not extraordinary. But across alts the destruction is real. That said, I see this BTC chart as a replica of early 2024. Range lows are meant to be taken out (check the early 2024 range). Do need the Donald not to nuke us. The trigger for the last move down was precisely tariffs news (on Canada and Mexico).” Krüger also says Bitcoin may still hit lower price targets before rallying. “BTC is bottom of the range, akin to April 30th, 2024 in my opinion. Maybe we go lower, maybe we bounce. Don’t know, but it’s a good spot regardless.” He notes that severe Bitcoin corrections occur multiple times a year, and may present buying opportunities. “One can make a living just from getting good at buying liquidations. We get two-four such liquidations a year.” The economist previously said that investors should zoom out because he thinks crypto is amid a supercycle, which could include painful Bitcoin pullbacks. “BTC is stuck in a range, which I think eventually resolves higher. The supercycle theory is intact. Even though it applies to Bitcoin and crypto as a whole (market cap ex BTC and stables is considerably higher), most old alts don’t benefit from it on a sustained basis. Should not expect an insane wave of liquidity driving all cr*p higher for an extended period of time. Be selective.” Bitcoin is trading for $84,608 at time of writing, down 4.8% in the last 24 hours.

With major coins experiencing sharp declines, traders are now eyeing emerging projects that could offer substantial returns. The question is, where should one place their bets? Dogecoin (DOGE) has dropped significantly, shaking investor confidence, while Pepe Coin is struggling with high volatility. But amidst the downturn, one memecoin is making waves— Arctic Pablo Coin (APC). With a powerful presale structure, strong tokenomics, and a growing community, APC is positioning itself as the best crypto to buy now. This article will cover the latest developments in Arctic Pablo Coin (APC), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Pepe Coin (PEPE). Arctic Pablo Coin: The Strategic Tokenomics Powering Its Rise Tokenomics is the backbone of any cryptocurrency, and for Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC), it’s a game-changer. With a total supply of 221.2 billion APC, its structure is designed for long-term value and sustainability. The presale allocation rewards early adopters, while unsold tokens are strategically burned, ensuring supply control and potential price appreciation. Staking rewards are another major highlight, incentivizing holders to participate actively. This structure is not just about speculation—it’s about building a lasting ecosystem that thrives beyond the initial hype. Arctic Pablo Coin’s best crypto to buy now status comes from its carefully crafted supply model, ensuring that early investors benefit from controlled distribution and strategic growth mechanisms. Penguinopolis: The Arctic Pablo Presale is Entering an Exciting Phase! The Arctic Pablo Coin presale has reached Penguinopolis, the 12th phase, and the excitement is undeniable. Currently priced at $0.000067 per APC, early investors are looking at a potential 11,844.78% ROI when it hits the listing price of $0.008. With over $1.62 million already raised, the momentum is building rapidly. Each new phase marks a price increase, meaning every delay could mean missing out on massive potential gains. Penguinopolis isn’t just a stop—it’s a crucial turning point for those looking to enter at an optimal price. As the price continues its upward trajectory, those who act now could secure one of the most lucrative opportunities in the meme coin space. For anyone looking for the best crypto to buy now, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale offers a rare chance to get in before it reaches the mainstream spotlight. Dogecoin Faces a Steep Decline—Investors Seek Alternatives Dogecoin (DOGE) is experiencing a significant downturn, leaving investors uncertain about its future. Currently down nearly 40% this month, DOGE has slipped to $0.208 as of February 26—its lowest point since December. The downturn is driven by waning interest and the overall market slump, particularly Bitcoin’s recent dip below $90,000, dragging down altcoins like DOGE. Analysts warn that if the trend continues, DOGE could see further declines, possibly touching $0.20. With a negative sentiment surrounding its price action, many investors are exploring new projects that could deliver better returns. Pepe Coin: A Rapid Rise, But Can It Sustain the Momentum? Pepe Coin has been a sensation in the meme coin world, quickly climbing to a $1.6 billion market cap shortly after launch. With its strong community and meme-driven appeal, it initially seemed unstoppable. However, the typical challenges of meme coins—high volatility, lack of utility, and weak adoption—are now catching up with it. Experts predict that Pepe’s price, currently at $0.000009, could decline soon as investor sentiment shifts. Pepe Coin’s long-term viability remains uncertain with traders looking for projects with stronger fundamentals. As a result, some investors are already exploring newer, more structured opportunities in the meme coin space. Conclusion: The Memecoin Market is Changing—Arctic Pablo Coin Leads the Charge With Dogecoin struggling and Pepe facing uncertain prospects, the memecoin market is in flux. But instead of signaling the end, this shift presents a golden opportunity for new projects to take center stage. Arctic Pablo meme coin presale , currently at Penguinopolis with a price of $0.000067, stands out as a prime investment. With strategic tokenomics, staking incentives, and a growing community, APC is shaping up to be the best crypto to buy now. Don’t wait until it’s too late—Arctic Pablo Coin’s journey is just beginning, and those who get in now could see exponential gains. For More Information: Arctic Pablo Coin: https://www.arcticpablo.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/ArcticPabloOfficial Twitter: https://x.com/arcticpabloHQ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What makes Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) the best crypto to buy now? Arctic Pablo Coin offers a structured presale, strategic tokenomics, and strong staking incentives, making it a standout investment. With its price currently at $0.000067 in the Penguinopolis phase, early investors can secure high potential returns. How does Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale work? The APC presale moves through multiple phases, with each phase increasing the price. The current phase, Penguinopolis, marks one of the last low-price opportunities before the final listing at $0.008. Why is Dogecoin struggling in 2025? Dogecoin has seen a nearly 40% drop this month due to declining trader interest and a general market downturn. Its lack of strong fundamentals is causing investors to look for alternative meme coin opportunities. Is Pepe Coin still a good investment? Pepe Coin gained massive popularity but faces high volatility and no clear long-term adoption. With its price currently at $0.000009, experts predict it could drop further, prompting investors to seek projects with more structured growth potential. How high can Arctic Pablo Coin go after its presale? Based on its listing price of $0.008, early investors in the current Penguinopolis phase at $0.000067 could see an ROI exceeding 11,844.78%. Its staking rewards and controlled supply model further support strong post-listing performance.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $4.66 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $14.78. Tezos started out really strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Following the November 5 U.S. elections and the emergence of ex-president Donald Trump, crypto markets have responded positively, with Bitcoin prices moving above the $100k mark. Tezos also responded similarly, hitting a high of $1.85. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $0.752 Market cap $776,038,568.52 Trading volume $24,372,160.31 Circulating supply 1,032,312,440.52 XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3146 on December 7, 2018 24-hour low $0.7414 24-hour high $0.7853 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 9.54% 50-day SMA $1.044 14-Day RSI 29.66 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 10 (Extreme Fear) Green days 15/30 (50%) 200-day SMA $0.9629 Tezos price analysis: Will XTZ surge past $0.85 soon? TL; DR Breakdown XTZ has lost 0.70% in the last 24 hours. The coin’s support is at $0.748, and resistance is around $0.792. Tezos faced rejection at $0.787. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart: XTZ to surge past its 20-day SMA soon? The daily price analysis of the Tezos (XTZ) coin on February 28 shows consolidation in the last trading hours. XTZ’s value is currently around $0.75, having faced rejection at $0.787. XTZ to surge past its 20-day SMA soon? The MACD indicator, with a bearish crossover, also confirms the selling signal observed on the chart. The RSI (36.28) reflects a market approaching oversold conditions, suggesting buying opportunities at a discount. If buyers reenter the market, XTZ could surge past its 20-day SMA at $0.856. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart: XTZ appears range-bound The 4-hour chart shows recovery for XTZ, with the coin approaching the middle Bollinger Band, although resistance remains intact at $0.770. The Bollinger Bands are tightening, suggesting reduced potential volatility in the short term and possible price consolidation. XTZ appears range-bound The CMF indicator hovering around zero shows a neutral market, supporting the chances of XTZ consolidating. Meanwhile, the MFI also suggests oversold conditions, indicating ongoing cash outflow. If XTZ fails to stay above $0.748, it might move toward lower support levels. To confirm a recovery, XTZ must break above $0.770. Tezos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.9468 SELL SMA 5 $0.9123 SELL SMA 10 $0.9240 SELL SMA 21 $0.9018 SELL SMA 50 $1.0443 SELL SMA 100 $1.2125 SELL SMA 200 $0.9629 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.9246 SELL EMA 5 $0.9980 SELL EMA 10 $1.1126 SELL EMA 21 $1.2210 SELL EMA 50 $1.2529 SELL EMA 100 $1.1481 SELL EMA 200 $1.0276 SELL What to expect from XTZ price analysis next? Tezos (XTZ) is down to about $0.756 and looks oversold, which might mean a short-term bounce. But overall, it’s still in a bearish trend. If it breaks above $1.25, it could turn bullish, but if not, it might keep dropping. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs – so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your own research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Why is Tezos down? Tezos (XTZ) is down today after facing rejection at the $0.7616 resistance level, a move spurred by selloffs. XTZ price history Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $2 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications.

Tezos historic price sentiment Tezos price history ⏐ Source: Coinmarketcap Tezos mainnet went live in September 2018 and immediately gained popularity for dealing with the environmental impact of blockchain technologies at that time with its PoS model. XTZ’s price peaked during the bullish cycle of 2021, reaching above $9.0. After 4 April 2022, XTZ’s price plummeted below $4.0; by 9 May, it had sharply fallen below the $2 mark. XTZ surged to about $1 at the beginning of December 2022, but the bears reclaimed the market by the end of the month, resulting in a drop to $0.73. The coin made some recovery in 2023, averaging a market price of $0.8. Tezos (XTZ) had a largely bearish 2024 despite the partnership milestones achieved. The coin reached a high of $1.4 in April but lost about 60% by August. The bulls soon entered the market, and XTZ saw renewed buyer interest, which resulted in a peak price of $0.7015 in September and $1.856 in November.

Stripe bets big on stablecoins to transform payments This stance aligns with Stripe’s strategic moves, including its $1.1 billion acquisition of stablecoin startup Bridge in October. However, given that the company handles transactions equivalent to approximately 1% of global GDP, it’s worth exploring why co-founders Patrick and John Collison are betting on blockchain technology. According to their annual letter, the Collison brothers argued that stablecoins represent an “improvement” on the “basic usability of money,” much in the same way that banknotes were an advancement from coins and—perhaps more controversially among The Block readers—fiat currency was an upgrade from the gold standard. Stripe founders believe that stablecoins have four important properties relative to the status quo: They make money movement cheaper and faster, they are decentralized and open-access (and thus globally available from day one), and they are programmable. To be precise, fiat-pegged cryptocurrencies enhance traditional monetary functions and open new avenues for using money. “Improvements to the basic usability of money make economies more prosperous,” the Collison brothers write. Stripe’s stance on crypto has evolved over time. The company famously halted Bitcoin payments in 2018 after just a few years, citing blockchain limitations at the time. However, after a four-year hiatus, Stripe re-entered the crypto space by enabling payouts in USDC—a move that expanded two years later to allow customers to accept stablecoin payments on Solana, Ethereum, and Polygon. While the move may have been influenced by competitors like PayPal and Visa embracing crypto payments, the Collison brothers maintained that the industry’s maturation drove the decision—faster transaction speeds, lower costs, and stablecoins delivering “real utility.” The Stripe co-founders emphasized that years of research and careful systems engineering were required for decentralized technologies to become competitive with traditional financial infrastructure. According to their letter, the conditions for widespread stablecoin adoption have only recently come together. Stablecoins reshape the future of digital transactions The Collison brothers highlight that stablecoin transaction volumes more than doubled between Q4 2023 and Q4 2024, with over 40 million monthly active wallets now in use. They point out that stablecoins are increasingly used for real-world applications, including corporate treasury management, remittances, savings in countries with volatile currencies, and enabling payments in regions with low card penetration. Just as the Stripe co-founders credit much of the company’s success to their early investment in AI solutions, they believe that establishing a leadership position in stablecoin services could fuel Stripe’s next growth phase. While stablecoins are a win-win for Stripe and its client base, they also largely benefit the US government, as many stablecoin advocates have argued. Not only are nearly all stablecoins denominated in the U.S. dollar — strengthening the greenback’s economic hegemony — but issuers like Tether and Circle are among the largest buyers of U.S. government debt due to their need for low-risk treasury assets. As of the end of 2024, Tether has direct and indirect exposure to $113 billion in US government debt. According to Treasury Department data , if it were a nation-state, it would rank as the 19th-largest holder of U.S. Treasury bills. The Collison brothers believe that stablecoins, functioning as a more user-friendly and accessible version of eurodollars, have the potential to deliver similar benefits to a much wider range of participants. However, the subtitle of the stablecoin section in Stripe’s annual letter likened the asset class to “room-temperature semiconductors”—a groundbreaking innovation that, while theorized to be transformative, has yet to become a reality.

A dubious meeting app called ‘GrassCall’ was recently used to spread malware that drains the user’s crypto wallets. The fraud is allegedly carried out by a Russian hacker team known as “Crazy Evil.” This group of cybercriminals specializes in social engineering attacks that trick users into installing infected software on their Mac and Windows PCs. Crazy Evil commonly targets people in the crypto space, where they promote fake job opportunities and games via various social media websites. A cybersecurity company, Recorded Future , said that it has connected “over ten active scams on social media” to Crazy Evil. Hackers posted fake jobs for a sham company called ChainSeeker.io More recently, reports of another fake scam company surfaced. This time, the company was called ChainSeeker.io, according to an X user . According to the reports , threat actors created fake company profiles for ChainSeeker.io on LinkedIn, where they have been sending out premium job listings. Other popular job boards where the fake listing was spotted include CryptoJobList, and WellFound. Job listings by ChainSeeker (Source: choykwok on X) All those who applied for the jobs were contacted via email, which instructed them to contact the company’s marketing chief on Telegram. Scam emails sent out by ChainSeeker to all job applicants (Source: choykwok on X) The chief would then request the user download a video calling app named ‘GrassCall’ from a now-deleted website. Depending on the user’s browser, the website would offer them a Mac or Windows client. A screenshot of the since-flagged website of the malicious app (Source: BleepingComputer) After downloading the app, users are asked to enter a code shared by the CMO in the Telegram chat. The website then either provides a Mac “GrassCall_v.6.10.dmg” [VirusTotal] client or a Windows “GrassCall.exe” client [VirusTotal] client. Once the correct code is entered, both apps install an info stealer, like Rhadamanthys (on Windows), remote access trojans (RATs), or other malware. On Macs, the Atomic (AMOS) Stealer malware gets installed. Scammer providing GrassCall code to a potential victim (Source: choykwok on X) Once installed, the virus collects wallet addresses, authentication cookies, and passwords stored in the online browser and Apple Keychain. The stolen information gets uploaded to a server and gets posted on Telegram channels owned by the malicious actors. If a wallet is found, the hackers use a brute force method to crack the passwords and drain the user’s assets. From these assets, the hackers pay out the user who made the unsuspecting victim download the malicious app. According to publicly released payment information, Crazy Evil members apparently earn tens of thousands of dollars per victim. Crazy Evil’s Telegram channel showings its earnings per user (Source: G0njxa on X) Various users have recounted their experiences after applying to such scam job postings. Cristian Ghita, a LinkedIn user , posted on the platform, “It looked legit from almost all angles. Even the video-conferencing tool had an almost believable online presence.” The hackers have reportedly moved on to a social engineering new campaign Cybersecurity researcher, Gonjxa , has also identified dubious meeting apps called Gatherum, and VibeCall. Gatherum was used in previous campaign by a subgroup of Crazy Evil called “Kevland.” Interestingly, both apps’ branding is pretty much identical to GrassCall. Now, the scammers have moved on to their new campaign with VibeCall, which is currently being circulated among Web3 job seekers. In response to the attention this attack received online, Chain Seeker’s job postings have now reportedly been taken down by most of the job boards. Chainseeker.io website is now flagged in community databases LinkedIn search results do not return any job posts linked to Chainseeker.io anymore. At the same time, its website has been flagged in community databases for being suspicious. Furthermore, LinkedIn accounts of the company’s employees have all been deleted. Users who have already interacted with scammers or installed suspicious apps on their devices are advised to change their passwords and authentication tokens and move their crypto to fresh wallets as a precautionary measure. It is also recommended to turn on two-factor authentication via an authentication app on all websites that support this feature.

SHIB is currently trading near $0.0000143 and has recorded a modest price increase of over 0.50% in the past 24 hours. However, the meme coin has lost more than 22% of its value over the past 30 days. SHIB Price Action and Upcoming Level With this significant price drop, SHIB has recently retested a crucial support level at $0.000013, which has historically acted as a rebound zone. According to expert technical analysis, SHIB appears bearish and could decline by 20% in the coming days. This bearish outlook is driven by the prevailing negative market sentiment and the formation of a doji candle at the $0.000015 resistance level.

Why Investors Expect 6,000% Growth for MUTM",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/a-new-solana-at-just-0-015-why-investors-expect-6000-growth-for-mutm/,"The search for the next major crypto opportunity has led investors to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a decentralized lending protocol with strong fundamentals and real financial utility. While speculative assets rise and fall on hype, MUTM is positioning itself as a sustainable DeFi platform with an actual use case—allowing users to lend, borrow, and earn passive income. With its presale price at just $0.015, many investors see this as a chance to secure tokens at the lowest possible valuation before demand drives prices higher. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance offers a structured lending and borrowing model that is advantageous to both institutional and individual investors, in contrast to projects that just rely on speculation. Users can deposit their cryptocurrency assets into liquidity pools and get incentives depending on usage rates through peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending. However, by offering overcollateralized loans, borrowers can obtain money without having to liquidate their possessions. This process strengthens the token’s long-term worth by generating an ongoing demand cycle. Mutuum Finance also uses mtTokens, which are deposited assets that gradually earn income. When a user contributes Ethereum to the network, for instance, they earn mtETH, which automatically rises in value as interest accrues. This approach is a desirable substitute for conventional staking models since it provides a consistent flow of passive revenue. Presale Success and Price Growth Expectations The rapid momentum of Mutuum Finance’s presale is another strong indicator of investor confidence. In just a short time, over $1.5 million has been raised, with nearly 3,000 investors securing their stake in the project. With a launch price set at $0.06, early buyers are already positioned for a 400% gain before the token even hits exchanges. However, analysts predict that due to increasing adoption, utility-driven demand, and planned exchange listings, MUTM could see price levels exceeding $0.90 or higher, delivering the projected 6,000% growth over time. For instance, an investor would acquire 146,666 MUTM tokens if they invested $2,200 at a price of $0.015 per during the presale. Their investment would yield a 60x return, or $132,000, if the price hits $0.90. Given the strong fundamentals supporting this possibility, it’s simple to understand why early investors are rushing in. To support long-term value appreciation, Mutuum Finance implements a buy-and-distribute mechanism. A portion of platform revenue is used to buy back MUTM tokens, creating continuous buying pressure in the market. These tokens are then distributed to suppliers and liquidity providers, encouraging long-term holding while simultaneously reducing sell pressure. As more users engage with the platform, this system strengthens the token’s stability and overall growth potential. Another major catalyst for Mutuum Finance is its overcollateralized stablecoin, which will be introduced as part of the lending protocol. Mutuum’s stablecoin will be supported by on-chain collateral, guaranteeing security and transparency in contrast to centralized stablecoins that depend on currency reserves. In order to increase liquidity and preserve a solid peg to its value, borrowers will be able to mint the stablecoin against the assets they have deposited. Mutuum’s ecosystem is further improved by this innovation, which draws additional customers to its loan platform. Investors can win free MUTM tokens as part of a $100,000 promotion being held by Mutuum Finance. The goal of this campaign is to incentivize early backers and encourage more participation as the presale picks up steam. Complete information and eligibility requirements are accessible on the official website, where participants can enter by following easy instructions. With the presale gaining momentum and institutional interest growing, many believe that MUTM could be the next major player in DeFi lending. As it approaches launch, the time to enter at the lowest possible price is now, before it follows the trajectory of other successful DeFi projects and skyrockets in value.

Part of Metamask's revamped roadmap includes adding smart contract capabilities to its current wallet. At the moment, MetaMask is an Externally Owned Account (EOA), a type of wallet that is controlled by a public and a private key. One of the main downfalls with EOAs is that it is subject to human error, meaning if you forget your private key, you lose your crypto holdings in that account forever. The other type of wallet that exists on Ethereum are Contract Accounts (CAs), which are controlled by code and have recovery mechanisms in place and security checks for verifying transactions. In a blog post shared during ETHDenver, the largest North American Ethereum conference, the MetaMask team said “smart-contract-based accounts allow us to solve a number of problems: allowing new powerful uses of the assets you hold, while simultaneously improving security. When the user defines their terms from their own programmable account, we greatly expand how the user expresses their agency in ways that are enforced by their own code.” One of those new features aimed at making the user experience on MetaMask easier include ERC-5792, which builds on its current feature, smart transactions . Under ERC-5792, or known as batched transactions, users can combine certain steps when it comes to signing off transactions, like “approve + swap” in one click, meaning that they would save time and gas fees by batching those steps together. Dan Finlay, the co-founder of MetaMask, told CoinDesk that batching transactions “give us all the things you're going to ask for in order, we'll present them to the user in a nice, unified way. The user will pay for one gas fee for the series of events and then it'll just be one block for the whole series of operations.” MetaMask card The MetaMask team also shared that its MetaMask debit card will be available in select states in the U.S. starting mid-March. The card has been in production for a few months and was initially available just to users in the UK and EU. It connects to a user’s MetaMask wallet, letting them spend their crypto. “You can be earning staking rewards or yield on your favorite protocol with your favorite tokens and have those funds available to spend anywhere that Mastercard is accepted with just a tap,” the team wrote in a blogpost. More support As part of the theme of making the user-experience easier, the MetaMask team will be adding support for Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL) in its wallets, meaning users can hold their various crypto assets in one place. “So these are simultaneously delivering some of the most popular blockchains, but, but they're also ensuring that we have smoothed out every part of our interface that allows new blockchains to be added seamlessly,” Finlay said in the interview.

Bitcoin MVRV Z-Score Has Plunged Under Its 365-Day MA In a new post on X, CryptoQuant Head of Research Julio Moreno has talked about why Bitcoin may not have reached a bottom yet. “All valuation metrics are in correction territory,” notes the analyst. “It can take more time.” Related Reading: XRP Indicator Reliable Since 2022 Now Gives This Signal An indicator that Moreno has cited as an example of this trend is the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Z-Score. This metric basically tells us about how the market cap of the asset compares against its realized cap. The “realized cap” is an on-chain capitalization model that calculates the total value of the BTC supply by assuming that each token in circulation has its ‘true’ value equal to the spot price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain. In other words, the realized cap sums up the cost basis of the cryptocurrency’s supply. As such, the model can be interpreted as a measure of the total amount of capital the investors as a whole have put into BTC. Since the MVRV Z-Score compares the market cap, which represents the value the investors are holding right now, against this initial investment, it tells us about the profit-loss status of the cryptocurrency’s user base. The MVRV Z-Score is similar to the popular MVRV Ratio, but where it differs from the latter is that it also applies a standard deviation test to pull out the extremes from the data. Now, here is the chart shared by Moreno that shows the trend in the Bitcoin MVRV Z-Score, as well as its 365-day moving average (MA), over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin MVRV Z-Score has recently witnessed a sharp decline. The reason for this drawdown naturally lies in the crash that the asset’s price has just gone through, which has put many investors into a state of loss. Despite the plummet, though, the metric remains above the zero mark. Below this level, the overall market enters into a state of loss, so the boundary has historically proven to be an important one for the cryptocurrency.

As the analyst has highlighted in the chart, past breakdowns of the line have generally led to notable periods of struggle for the Bitcoin price. It only remains to be seen how long BTC would have to stay under the level this time around, before its price reaches a bottom. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $86,300, down more than 11% over the last seven days.

More on LINK and DOT’s Market Performance,https://thecoinrise.com/web3bays-presale-hits-1-5-in-weeks-is-it-the-next-e-commerce-giant-more-on-link-and-dots-market-performance/,"E-commerce and decentralized systems are evolving rapidly through blockchain innovation. Web3Bay is transforming online shopping by removing intermediaries, creating a marketplace where transactions are directly between buyers and sellers, and maintaining complete autonomy. Unlike conventional platforms burdened with hefty fees and restrictive data policies, Web3Bay utilizes smart contracts for transactions that are secure and transparent. While Chainlink and Polkadot have made strides in data linkage and blockchain interoperability, Web3Bay captures attention by tackling the inefficiencies of e-commerce, delivering financial fairness and autonomy to its users. Web3Bay Pioneers Decentralized E-commerce with Blockchain! The migration from traditional to blockchain-enabled marketplaces is accelerating, with Web3Bay leading by eradicating intermediaries and empowering buyers and sellers with full transaction control. Web3Bay diverges from centralized services that set rigid rules and high fees, offering a decentralized choice where transactions are protected by smart contracts and ownership transparency is a given. The foundational principles of Web3—ownership, transparency, and decentralization—are reshaping online commerce. Web3Bay leverages blockchain to allow sellers to keep a larger share of profits while buyers enjoy transparent pricing free of undisclosed fees. Escrow-backed smart contracts also minimize fraud and disputes, fostering a marketplace where trust prevails over corporate governance. Investor trust in Web3Bay is on the rise, as evidenced by its presale collecting $1.5 million so far. Now in Stage 4, the 3BAY token is valued at $0.00456, with a total of over 375 million tokens already purchased. As users increasingly seek autonomy in their dealings, Web3Bay is recognized as a beacon for financial fairness and autonomy in online shopping. Chainlink’s Journey: From Inception to Today Launched in 2017, Chainlink (LINK) set out to connect smart contracts with real-world data via a decentralized Oracle network. It debuted during its ICO at a price of $0.11 and gathered $32 million. The technology has since facilitated secure access to external data for smart contracts, crucial for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. As of February 19, 2025, LINK is trading at $18.04, marking an increase of more than 16,000% from its ICO, with a circulating supply of about 517 million tokens and a market cap of $9.33 billion. Its significant role in DeFi, securing assets valued at over $75 billion across various platforms, contributes to this success. Polkadot’s Development and Current Market Performance Polkadot (DOT), which started in May 2020, seeks to improve blockchain interoperability with its innovative multi-chain structure. Founded by Ethereum co-founder Dr. Gavin Wood, Polkadot enables diverse blockchains to interact seamlessly through its relay chain and parachains. The network has witnessed considerable expansion, with transactions soaring from 20 million in January 2024 to nearly 60 million by November 2024—a 200% increase. Presently, on February 19, 2025, DOT trades at $4.79, with a market capitalization of about $7.13 billion, although this is a decrease from its peak of over $45 in January 2021. Despite recent pricing setbacks, Polkadot’s technological enhancements, such as the development of bridges to major networks like Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain, highlight its dedication to fostering a scalable, interconnected blockchain ecosystem. Final Remarks! Blockchain technology continues to catalyze significant innovations, providing new opportunities across diverse sectors. While Chainlink and Polkadot fortify decentralized networks through improved data reliability and interoperability, Web3Bay adopts a direct approach to transforming online shopping. By eliminating middlemen and utilizing smart contracts, Web3Bay promotes greater transparency, security, and cost-efficiency for both buyers and sellers. As decentralized solutions become more prevalent, platforms that prioritize real-world applications are poised for ongoing growth. Web3Bay’s streamlined approach to e-commerce transactions underlines its potential to redefine digital marketplace standards, establishing new norms for financial autonomy and user control in online commerce.

40937161,https://coingape.com/?p=241500,1740708923,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,US SEC Confirms Meme Coins Are Not Securities but Warns of Fraud,https://coingape.com/us-sec-confirms-meme-coins-are-not-securities-but-warns-of-fraud/,"The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has clarified that meme coins do not fall under federal securities laws. The agency stated that these digital assets are more like collectibles and are not subject to the regulations that apply to traditional financial instruments. However, the SEC warned that fraudulent activities related to meme coins could still lead to enforcement actions by other federal or state authorities. US SEC States Meme Coins Are Not Securities In a statement released on February 27, the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance stated that meme coins do not qualify as securities under the Securities Act of 1933. “It is the Division’s view that transactions in the types of meme coins described in this statement do not involve the offer and sale of securities under the federal securities laws,” the statement read. The agency explained that meme coins do not provide any rights to future income, profits, or assets, which are key factors in determining whether an asset is a security. It also noted that meme coins do not generate yield and are primarily driven by market speculation and social trends. The agency clarified that since meme coins do not meet the definition of securities, their issuers and traders do not need to register transactions with the agency. The statement emphasized that meme coin buyers and holders are not protected by securities laws. SEC Warns of Fraud in the Meme Coin Market Despite the clarification that they are not securities, the SEC warned that fraudulent activities in this sector could still face legal consequences. The agency noted that while it does not regulate meme coins under securities laws, other federal or state agencies may take action against deceptive practices. Khurram Dara, a lawyer at Bain Capital Crypto, pointed out that misleading promotions, scams, and fraudulent schemes involving meme coins could still be prosecuted. The agency also stated that it would continue to monitor the crypto market for any potential violations of financial regulations. “The offer and sale of meme coins do not involve an investment in an enterprise nor is it undertaken with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others,” the statement added. House Democrats Bill to Restrict Politicians Before the SEC’s statement, House Democrats had announced plans to introduce the Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement (MEME) Act. The proposed bill seeks to prevent public officials, including presidents and their families, from launching or endorsing meme coins. California Representative Sam Liccardo, who is leading the bill, stated that the legislation aims to stop political figures from profiting off meme coins. The move comes after President Donald Trump launched a meme coin named “TRUMP” shortly before taking office. The TRUMP token saw rapid gains but later experienced a sharp decline, losing over 50% of its value in the past month. The market reaction led to concerns about political figures using meme coins for financial gain. Crypto Industry Reacts to SEC’s Clarification The statement has been welcomed by some members of the crypto industry who have long sought regulatory clarity. Ishmael Green, a crypto attorney at Diaz Reus law firm, said the decision could encourage more investment in the U.S. crypto market. “This will drive continued investment in the U.S. crypto space, as the vast majority of meme coins launched in the last 12 months with multibillion-dollar market caps have been released on Solana, an American blockchain,” Green stated. Major crypto exchanges, including Coinbase and Robinhood , saw a slight rise in their stock prices following the agency’s announcement. Market analysts believe that the clarification could allow exchanges to list more meme coins without the risk of regulatory enforcement.
