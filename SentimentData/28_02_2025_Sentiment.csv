With an 80% reduction in volatility, Chainlink shows signs of a looming breakout as Smart DEX traders ramp up their positions. Simultaneously, SUI coin has approached key support levels following a predictable downturn, leaving traders anticipating a possible rebound. Amid these market shifts, BlockDAG (BDAG) captures the spotlight. With over 500,000 users, BlockDAG’s X1 Miner App has become a viral sensation, simplifying how to mine BDAG from smartphones. This surge in activity comes just in time as the window to mine BDAG before its anticipated exchange listings begins to close, highlighting BlockDAG as a potential best crypto for 2025 . For those eyeing substantial returns, now is the time to engage before the mining rewards taper off. Over 500,000 Users Mining BDAG: Here’s Your Chance to Join The popularity of the BlockDAG X1 Miner App has skyrocketed, with the user count crossing the half-million mark as enthusiasts rush to mine BDAG directly from their phones. This method, free from the complexities of traditional mining setups, offers a straightforward path to acquiring crypto. With BDAG poised for upcoming major exchange listings, current miners are strategically positioning themselves to accumulate coins before the expected surge in demand. If you’re scouting for the best crypto for 2025 , mining BDAG now could significantly amplify your portfolio’s growth potential. The presale of BlockDAG has successfully garnered $199 million, with BDAG currently valued at $0.0248 in its 27th batch. Early adopters have witnessed a staggering 2,380% gain, with projections suggesting a potential rise to $1 by 2025. LINK Price Sees Reduced Volatility: A Precursor to Surge? LINK’s volatility has sharply decreased to 80%, drawing the attention of savvy traders who predict a significant move ahead. Historically, reduced volatility often precedes a market breakout, and Smart DEX traders are not just watching—they’re actively increasing their holdings. With notable wallets accumulating LINK, including one that previously secured a 136% return, the sentiment is bullish. As the market anticipates LINK’s next move, the rising Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) suggests an uptick in buying pressure, possibly steering LINK price towards a breakout. SUI Coin’s Price Dynamics: Testing Key Support Levels The Sui coin has traced a path consistent with predictions, falling to $3.5165 before it tested the lower support at $3.2379. This trajectory aligns precisely with prior analyses, validating a robust pattern in its price movements. Currently, traders are closely monitoring to see if SUI maintains these levels or further declines to $2.5611. The latest insights indicate that crucial resistance and support levels are still active, and there could be a turnaround if the momentum shifts. Looking forward, should the Sui coin stabilize above $5.5840, it might set the stage for a confirmed breakout. Successfully retesting the $4.40 level could propel the coin towards $5.7788 and potentially higher. If the upward trend persists, SUI could aim for successive targets at $8.1673, $9.0186, and even $12.9780. The imminent days will be pivotal in determining whether SUI is poised for a significant rebound. In Summary As LINK price shows newfound stability and potential for growth, and SUI coin navigates critical support levels, the crypto market remains on edge. Meanwhile, BlockDAG’s X1 Miner App has attracted a massive user base, poised for success as one of the best crypto for 2025 . As these developments unfold, the race to secure prime positions in the burgeoning crypto landscape is intensifying.

In a new announcement, Binance says its adding support for MyShell ( SHELL ), a protocol that allows users to create, share and own AI agents that can be used for professional and personal assistance as well as companionship.

Led by OpenAI, these powerful yet proprietary models offer users advanced applications and services for complex data analysis and human-computer interactions.

March 2025 is shaping up to be a pivotal month for several major crypto projects, with groundbreaking developments, strategic partnerships, and increased adoption fueling the industry’s momentum. The battle for dominance among blockchain networks has intensified, with the focus shifting toward real-world use cases, scalability, and decentralization. One of the most exciting projects right now is Qubetics ($TICS ) —a revolutionary blockchain platform solving the cross-border transaction inefficiencies that have plagued legacy financial systems. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies that focus solely on decentralization, Qubetics is bridging the gap between security, speed, and real-world utility, making it an appealing prospect for early buyers. Let’s explore the top five cryptocurrencies to watch this month: Qubetics, Cronos, Render, Stellar, and Celestia. 1.

The project has gained significant traction, with its presale currently in its 23rd stage, having already sold over 490 million tokens to more than 21,500 holders—raising an impressive $14.1 million. At this stage, $TICS tokens are available for just $0.0888. The crypto presale ’s strategy is structured to reward early adopters, with a 10% price increase every weekend. Analysts predict a potential surge in value, with $TICS projected to hit $0.25 at the end of the presale (a 181% ROI). Post-launch, forecasts indicate the potential for exponential growth, reaching $1, $5, or even $15 after the mainnet launch. Real-Life Impact: Cross-Border Transactions Qubetics is redefining cross-border payments, addressing challenges such as high fees, slow processing times, and centralization risks.

Notably, this comment is gaining attention in the crypto community when the market is experiencing major declines. Bitcoin Price Outlook Amid Market Fluctuations In a recent development, Kendrick reiterated his speculations that Bitcoin will hit $200,000 by the end of this year and climb to $500,000 before Donald Trump leaves office. His comments come after Bitcoin’s price dropped to a three-month low, sinking below $90,000 earlier this week. According to CoinGecko data, the cryptocurrency was trading at $86,418 earlier this week, marking a 20% decline from its all-time high of $108,786 in January. In addition, the Stanford analyst linked this decline to broader economic concerns, including uncertainty surrounding global trade tariffs and unending geopolitical tensions in regions like Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Gaza. Institutional Adoption and Regulatory Developments Furthermore, Kendrick’s recent comments also relate that institutional involvement is key to stabilizing Bitcoin and driving long-term growth. He added that conventional financial firms like Standard Chartered and BlackRock, which have introduced Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), will play a crucial role in bringing legitimacy and reducing market volatility. He also pointed out that clear regulations in the U.S. will be a driving mechanism that will strengthen the stability of digital assets in the country. This would encourage larger financial institutions to invest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Additionally, he asserted that as the clear engagement policies take shape, more U.S. banks and institutional investors will step into the crypto space, potentially leading to a more structured and secure market environment. Trump’s Influence on Crypto Growth It is necessary to add that political factors also shape Bitcoin’s future, with Donald Trump’s presidency playing a key role. After his December election victory, Bitcoin surged past $100,000 for the first time, fueled by optimism from investors who see him as pro-crypto. In January 2025, Trump signed an executive order to boost cryptocurrency adoption and create a national digital asset stockpile, reinforcing his administration’s support for the industry. Crypto firms and executives also played a major role in the 2024 election, contributing nearly half of corporate donations, with some investing tens of millions into Trump’s campaign. With strong backing from the industry, Kendrick believes Bitcoin could still hit $500,000 before Trump leaves office.

Analysts debate Ripple’s impact, with concerns over lobbying against Bitcoin. SBI VC Trade expands lending services, boosting XRP adoption and utility. Ripple’s XRP has seen price declines recently. As a result, this has led to mixed reactions from analysts. Some think the cryptocurrency is struggling due to outside factors. However, others argue it remains strong against Bitcoin (BTC). Adding another layer to the story, Japanese exchange SBI VC Trade has increased its cryptocurrency lending services, which adds more options for XRP holders Conflicting Views on Market Performance Tony Edward has pushed back against Bitcoin maximalists. Specifically, he says they are unfairly singling out XRP’s decline when the entire crypto market is experiencing a general downturn.

The body is named the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors’ Office-run Joint Investigation Unit (JIU) for Virtual Asset Crimes. The unit has been operating since 2023. But it was originally intended to function as a temporary task force. It was formed to fight what officials thought would be a short-lived spike in high-profile crypto-related fraud cases. Crypto Crime: New Unit to Tackle Fraud Cases However, the JIU has been inundated with work since its formation. And with crypto adoption and crypto-related crime on the rise in South Korea, last month, the prosecution service decided to formalize the body and grant it a certain degree of independence . A launching ceremony for the Joint Digital Asset Crime Investigation Division, held in Seoul, South Korea on February 27, 2025. (Source: Yonhap TV News/Screenshot) Per Aju News and MBC News , the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors’ Office has essentially “promoted” to the level of “formal joint investigation department.” As its name suggests, the body consists of public prosecutors. But it also comprises 11 financial regulators staffers from the Financial Services Commission and the Financial Supervisory Service. The JIU will initially have 34 full-time employees in total. Most of the staffers already have considerable experience dealing with crypto-related fraud cases. At a launching ceremony, the body vowed to investigate “unfair” crypto “practices.” These include insider trading and price manipulation cases. Since its initial inception, the body has indicted 74 people and arrested 25 individuals. A South Korean appeals court will decide next month whether the country’s main opposition leader violated election laws https://t.co/FqJPaLoKJx — Bloomberg (@business) February 26, 2025 Front-page News In recent months, the JIU’s operations became the subject of front-page news, when it began probing a suspected scam coin named Queenbee. The investigation eventually led the JIU to indict a high-profile shaman named Jeon Seong-bae, aka Geon Jin. The JIU arrested the shaman on suspicions of “handling illegal political funds from politicians and candidates” during the nation’s 2018 local elections. The unit will be led by Chief Prosecutor Park Geon-wook. His team also comprises two deputy chief prosecutors. The Southern District Prosecutors’ Office said that as crypto fraudsters become more “sophisticated, intelligent, and globalized,” it would create an “effective crime response system.” The post South Korean Prosecution Crypto Crime Unit Officially Launches appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|Legal|South Korea,EN,0,0,ASIA|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-02-27 23:30:00

California Democrat Rep. Sam Liccardo is leading the push against Trump’s meme coin, though he has insistently argued that taking aim at the president’s crypto token was not his original intention when he first ran for office. He claimed, however, that Trump’s move to release a new meme coin needed some kind of response, especially since the token’s price quickly plummeted, leaving some investors with losses. Liccardo believes President Trump’s decision to launch a meme coin was unethical and an abuse of his authority Liccardo, also a former criminal prosecutor, argued that the nation should reinstate stricter anti-corruption laws, targeting Trump’s meme çoin. According to him, Trump exploited his authority, office, and the people for his personal gain, calling the president’s actions “unethical.” He added that Trump’s token raised concerns about transparency, insider trading, and improper foreign influence, saying that even some of Trump’s supporters disapproved of the meme coin launch. Thus, he introduced legislation against the token on Thursday, the Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement, or MEME Act. Liccardo even stated he had about a dozen Democratic cosponsors backing his legislation. The bill should apply to the president, vice president, Congress members, senior executive officials, and their immediate families. Violators could face fines and up to five years in prison. The bill’s draft so far dictates that Trump will have to give up his earnings from the token’s sale. Moreover, the legislation will prevent the president, any of his family members or members of Congress from issuing or promoting securities and crypto assets like meme coins. The legislation would also introduce criminal and civil penalties and bans on some financial assets. Additionally, private investors who lose their funds on meme coins promoted by state officials will be permitted to sue. Liccardo even commented, “You need to have some enforcement mechanism and a private right of action helps to keep everybody honest.” However, the bill may fail to pass in the now Republican-controlled Congress, but he believes that the legislation will lay the groundwork for Democrats if they regain power or at least show their stance against Trump’s corruption. Trump and his family have been actively involved in several crypto projects Meme coins have long been considered risky and speculative assets, with most critics comparing them to Ponzi schemes that only profit insiders and unethical celebrities. When Trump first released his token, its price quickly surged to almost $70 before dropping to roughly $12. Nevertheless, analysts believe that the token generated millions of dollars for the launching entities before its immense price drop from its trading fees. The First Lady’s MELANIA token also saw a trajectory similar to that of Trump. It surged explosively after its launch but has since fallen from its peak days, trading at only $0.8522 . Not to mention, one of the developers involved in the MELANIA token launch was found to be tangled with the LIBRA token scandal, for which Argentine President Javier Milei is still being investigated. In addition to his and Melania’s token releases, Trump and his sons launched a decentralized crypto platform in 2024 and even supported online stores selling crypto-themed sneakers. However, the president has tried to distance himself from his family’s crypto projects and overall businesses by signing an ethics agreement that will hinder him from making outside business deals. Liccardo pushes MEME Act to curb corruption, but faces political and industry resistance The MEME Act has received backing from Reps. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). But its passage in the GOP-controlled Congress is highly unlikely. Liccardo said the bill is partly a symbolic step against corruption and a basis for action if Democrats regain state legislature control. Beyond meme coins, the legislation’s broad language captures all securities and digital assets, designed to harden loopholes for indirect profits. It also requires disclosures of foreign cryptocurrency ties, but the law presents challenges for enforcement. Mixed reactions from industry: Some crypto advocates took to social media to criticize Trump’s action as a “stunt,” while others characterized the bill as politically unviable. The proposal showcases growing scrutiny of officials’ financial conduct in financial markets. The freshman lawmaker representing Silicon Valley’s 16th District since January 2025, has positioned himself as an advocate for ethical governance with the MEME Act. Yet his party faces a great deal of scrutiny over inconsistencies in addressing financial conflicts. While a few Democrats, including progressives like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC), support banning congressional stock trading, establishment figures like former Speaker Nancy Pelosi have resisted such reforms. Pelosi’s husband, Paul Pelosi, faced criticism for trades made during the Covid-19 pandemic, including a $5 million windfall trading options in Alphabet shares in advance of a hearing on tech that she oversaw. Pelosi defended lawmakers’ right to trade in the markets, saying that some proposals were “anti-free market.” Public polls show that Americans support the limitations on what could be traded. Liccardo’s concern with meme coin regulation also underscores Democrats’ larger challenge of balancing their progressive reform aspirations with powerful financial interests.

Expert trader Raoul Pal shared a bullish comment regarding SOL price in a recent post on X. He believes the coin is at its oversold level and will likely plot a rebound soon. State of the Solana Price Considering his X account , Raoul Pal said SOL is at 2 standard deviations oversold on the log regression channel. He pointed out that Solana is showcasing the lowest Relative Strength Index (RSI) since the 2022 lows. Per the onchain data, the RSI dropped as low as 25.73 on February 26, way below the oversold level . As Pal pointed out, Solana is likely to grow significantly higher in the coming month. While he is not taking new positions at the current level, he implied that this period marks the best area to buy the dip. According to CoinMarketCap data, the price of Solana was trading for $137.16, up marginally by 0.47% in 24 hours. Although the volatility is yet to clear, SOL has recorded more than 1.2% against Bitcoin within the same period. With the current outlook, the coin has now pared off its price over the past week which has dropped by 21%. SOL Price Historical Trend in March The odds of Solana soaring in the coming month is high, as the coin has historically soared in March. Data from Cryptorank pegs the average growth rate in the price of Solana in March at 32.4%. In March 2021, SOL price jumped by 49%, complemented by a 23.2% rally in 2022. While the coin saw a 3.25% retracement, growth peaked in March 2024 when it skyrocketed by 60.8%. Solana Price Monthly Returns. Source: Cryptorank If historical trends play out again, the coin may pare off its losses over the past month, now pegged at 39.5%. Potential Growth Drivers to Watch With Coinbase’s lawsuit dismissed by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), it implies that the claim Solana is an investment contract no longer holds. Current improving regulations in the country have indirectly placed altcoins in a positive light. With the cases closed and the regulator clarifying that memecoins are not securities, innovators may re-ignite the meme hype. Notably, this marked one of the biggest catalysts that drove the coin’s price to an all-time high above $294. Ultimately, the Solana ETF hype may also continue, pushing the asset into a position for adoption by institutional investors if approved. With Franklin Templeton’s SOL ETF filing submitted to the US SEC, the participation is high, pushing the approval odds higher.

The market just witnessed a seismic event that has the entire crypto sphere buzzing. Leading on-chain analytics platform, CryptoQuant , has reported a jaw-dropping Bitcoin inflow of 6,779 BTC, valued at a staggering $573.6 million, flooding into spot exchanges within a mere hour. This sudden surge has sparked intense speculation – is this a precursor to a major market move, or just whales repositioning their assets? Let’s dive deep into the details of this intriguing development. Unpacking the Massive Bitcoin Inflow: CryptoQuant’s Alert When CryptoQuant , a trusted source for on-chain crypto analytics, raises an alarm, it’s time to pay attention. Their recent report highlights an “unusual” spike in Bitcoin inflow to exchanges. But what exactly does this mean, and why is it significant? Essentially, an inflow of Bitcoin to exchanges typically indicates an intent to sell. Traders move their BTC to exchanges to have it readily available for trading against other cryptocurrencies or fiat currencies. A large, rapid inflow, like the one CryptoQuant detected, can often precede periods of increased selling pressure and potential price volatility. Let’s break down the specifics of this substantial exchange inflow : Total Inflow: 6,779 BTC Value: $573.6 million (at the time of the report) Timeframe: Within one hour Now, let’s look at where this massive wave of Bitcoin landed. Coinbase Dominates the Bitcoin Exchange Inflow The lion’s share of this Bitcoin inflow landed on two prominent platforms: Coinbase Advanced and Coinbase Prime. Coinbase , a leading cryptocurrency exchange known for its institutional and retail client base, absorbed a significant portion of this influx. Here’s the detailed breakdown: Exchange Platform BTC Inflow Percentage Coinbase Advanced 3,355 BTC 49% Coinbase Prime 3,256 BTC 48% Bitstamp 108 BTC 1% Total 6,719 BTC 98% As you can see, Coinbase platforms accounted for a whopping 97% of the total inflow, with Coinbase Advanced and Coinbase Prime receiving nearly equal amounts. Bitstamp received a much smaller fraction. This concentration on Coinbase raises further questions – why Coinbase specifically? And what does it signal for the market? Why is a Large BTC Inflow to Exchanges Significant? Understanding the implications of a large BTC inflow is crucial for navigating the volatile crypto market. Here’s why this kind of movement matters: Potential Selling Pressure: As mentioned earlier, moving BTC to exchanges is often a precursor to selling. A large inflow suggests a significant number of holders might be preparing to liquidate their positions, potentially driving prices down. Market Sentiment Indicator: Sudden spikes in exchange inflow can reflect a shift in market sentiment. It could indicate growing bearishness or profit-taking after a price rally. Volatility Catalyst: Large inflows can inject volatility into the market. The increased supply on exchanges can lead to rapid price swings as traders react to the potential for increased selling pressure. Whale Activity: Such massive transfers are often associated with whale activity – large holders moving substantial amounts of Bitcoin. Tracking these flows can provide insights into whale strategies and potential market manipulation. Are There Alternative Explanations for the Exchange Inflow? While a large BTC inflow often points to selling pressure, it’s important to consider alternative explanations. CryptoQuant itself notes that: “Some of these deposits may be from customers using exchange custody solutions.” This is a crucial point. Here are a few alternative scenarios to consider: Custodial Services Repositioning: Exchanges like Coinbase offer custodial services to institutions and individuals. These entities might be moving funds between different custody solutions or consolidating assets on the exchange for various operational reasons, not necessarily for immediate selling. OTC Desk Transfers: Over-the-counter (OTC) desks often utilize exchanges for settlement. Large inflows could be related to OTC trades being settled on exchanges, which doesn’t always translate to immediate market selling. Internal Exchange Transfers: Exchanges themselves might be moving funds internally between different wallets or platforms for security or operational purposes. These internal movements could be misinterpreted as external inflows if not properly analyzed. Actionable Insights: Navigating Market Volatility So, what should crypto traders and investors make of this Bitcoin inflow ? Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Price Action Closely: Keep a close watch on Bitcoin’s price movement in the coming hours and days. Increased selling pressure could lead to price corrections. Track On-Chain Metrics: Continue to monitor on-chain data from platforms like CryptoQuant for further insights into exchange flows, whale activity, and other market indicators. Manage Risk: In times of potential market volatility, prudent risk management is key. Consider adjusting your portfolio allocations and using risk management tools like stop-loss orders. Stay Informed: Keep yourself updated with the latest market news and analysis from reputable sources to make informed decisions. Conclusion: Decoding the Bitcoin Exchange Inflow Mystery The sudden $573 million Bitcoin inflow to exchanges, as flagged by CryptoQuant , is undoubtedly a noteworthy event in the crypto market. While it could signal potential selling pressure and market volatility, alternative explanations like custodial repositioning and OTC transfers cannot be ruled out. The concentration of this inflow on Coinbase platforms adds another layer of intrigue to this development. As the market digests this information, close monitoring of price action and further on-chain data will be crucial to decipher the true implications of this massive Bitcoin movement.

40932328,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=135131,1740699766,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary Figure AI to Launch Astonishing Home Robot Alpha Testing in 2025,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/figure-ai-home-robot-testing/,"Get ready for a potentially groundbreaking shift in home technology! Figure AI, a robotics startup making waves, has just announced an accelerated timeline for bringing its humanoid robot into our homes. While the crypto world thrives on disruptive innovation, this development from Figure AI signals a tangible leap in robotics that could soon impact our daily lives in astonishing ways. Forget distant dreams of robot butlers – Figure is aiming to start “alpha testing” its Figure 02 humanoid robot in actual home settings as early as 2025. Let’s dive into what this means and why it’s happening sooner than many expected. Why the Accelerated Timeline for Home Robots? The Power of Helix Figure CEO Brett Adcock attributes this faster pace to their innovative “generalist” Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model, aptly named Helix. This sophisticated AI is the real engine behind Figure’s ambitious schedule. Here’s why Helix is a game-changer: Generalist Approach: Unlike narrow AI focused on specific tasks, Helix is designed to be a jack-of-all-trades. It can learn and adapt to a wider range of situations and tasks, crucial for the unpredictable nature of home environments. Vision and Language Fusion: Helix processes both visual data and natural language input. Imagine instructing your home robot with simple voice commands or showing it what needs to be done – Helix bridges the gap between human instruction and robotic action. Rapid Learning: This VLA model is built to accelerate the robot’s learning curve. The faster it can grasp new tasks, the quicker it can become truly useful in a dynamic home setting. This announcement of accelerated alpha testing comes hot on the heels of Figure unveiling Helix itself. The company’s strategic decision to move away from its publicized partnership with OpenAI in favor of proprietary AI models like Helix underscores their commitment to controlling and optimizing their AI foundation. This independence is key to driving innovation and tailoring the AI specifically for their humanoid robot ambitions. Home Sweet Home for Humanoid Robots? Figure’s Vision The idea of home robots isn’t entirely new, but Figure’s concrete timeline brings it closer to reality. We’ve even had glimpses into Figure’s home aspirations, with early lab tests showcased at their South Bay offices. Last week’s Helix reveal further illuminated these plans, showcasing videos of robots tackling various household chores – even food preparation! One particularly interesting aspect is Helix’s design to orchestrate two robots working together on a single task. This hints at a future where multiple humanoid robots might collaborate in our homes to tackle complex tasks more efficiently. Consider these potential home applications: Household Chores: From tidying up and doing laundry to cleaning surfaces and organizing spaces, home robots could alleviate the burden of everyday housework. Meal Preparation: Imagine robots capable of following recipes, preparing ingredients, and even cooking meals, freeing up your time and simplifying daily routines. Assistance for the Elderly: As populations age, humanoid robots could provide invaluable support for older adults, helping them maintain independence at home for longer. This could range from mobility assistance to medication reminders and emergency support. From Factory Floors to Living Rooms: The Robotics Journey While the allure of home robots is strong, the initial focus for most robotics companies, including Figure, has been on industrial applications. Why the detour to factories and warehouses first? Lucrative Industrial Deployment: The immediate financial returns in industrial settings are more attractive. Factories and warehouses offer structured environments where robots can perform repetitive tasks, increasing efficiency and productivity. Controlled Environments: Industrial settings are generally more predictable and safer than homes. This allows for easier testing and deployment of early-stage robotics technology. Willing Early Adopters: Companies like BMW, where Figure is piloting its systems, are willing to invest in testing and implementing robotics solutions to optimize their operations. This industrial phase is seen as a crucial stepping stone. Gaining experience and refining the technology in controlled environments like factories paves the way for the more complex and nuanced challenges of deploying humanoid robots in homes. The Unique Challenges of Home Robotics Bringing robotics into our homes is a different ballgame compared to factories. Homes are wonderfully diverse and, let’s face it, often messy! Here are some key hurdles: Challenge Description Variability: Every home is unique in layout, furniture, lighting, and clutter. Robots need to adapt to endless variations. Unpredictability: Homes are dynamic environments with people, pets, and unexpected events. Robots must navigate unpredictable situations safely and effectively. Affordability: Consumer robotics must be priced competitively to be adopted widely. Balancing advanced capabilities with affordability is crucial. Safety: Home robots must be absolutely safe to operate around humans, children, and pets. Safety protocols and fail-safes are paramount. User Experience: Robots need to be easy to use and integrate seamlessly into daily life. Intuitive interfaces and reliable performance are essential for user adoption. While Figure’s 2025 “ alpha testing ” designation implies very early-stage trials, it’s a significant leap forward. It signals that the era of home robots is inching closer, driven by advancements in AI and the relentless pursuit of innovative companies like Figure AI. What Does This Mean for the Future? Figure’s ambitious timeline for home robots , fueled by their Helix VLA model, is a clear indication of the rapid progress in the field. While widespread adoption is still some years away, the prospect of humanoid robots assisting us in our homes is becoming increasingly tangible. This development has far-reaching implications: Enhanced Quality of Life: Home robots have the potential to free up our time, reduce stress from mundane chores, and provide valuable assistance, especially for the elderly and those with mobility limitations. New Industries and Job Creation: The rise of home robotics will spawn new industries focused on robot development, maintenance, software, and related services, creating new job opportunities. Societal Impact: As robotics becomes more integrated into our lives, it will raise important societal questions about ethics, privacy, and the evolving relationship between humans and machines. Figure AI’s push towards home robots is more than just technological advancement; it’s a glimpse into a future where technology seamlessly integrates into our homes, transforming how we live and interact with our surroundings. Keep an eye on Figure – they might just be shaping the next frontier of domestic life.

Provider Account/Details: You might be redirected to the chosen provider’s interface (or an embedded window) to link your existing account or create a new one. This is where you’ll provide payment details for receiving fiat currency. KYC Verification (if needed): If it’s your first time using the provider or for larger amounts, you might be prompted to complete KYC verification as required by regulations. Confirm and Execute: Review all transaction details, including fees and exchange rates, and confirm the off-ramp transaction within the Uniswap Wallet. Transaction Processing: The chosen provider will process the conversion and initiate the fiat currency transfer to your specified payment method. Processing times vary depending on the provider and payment method. Potential Challenges and Things to Keep in Mind While this update is incredibly positive, it’s important to be aware of potential challenges and considerations: Fees: Off-ramping services always involve fees. Be sure to compare fees across providers and understand the fee structure before initiating a transaction. Fees can include transaction fees, exchange rate markups, and payment processing fees. Regulatory Compliance (KYC/AML): Fiat off-ramping is subject to regulatory scrutiny. Expect to undergo KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) verification processes with the chosen provider. This is a standard practice to comply with financial regulations. Geographic Restrictions: The availability of specific providers and fiat currencies may be limited by geographic location and regulatory restrictions. Confirm that the service is available in your region. Exchange Rate Fluctuations: Cryptocurrency prices are volatile. The exchange rate at the time of initiating the off-ramp transaction might differ slightly from the rate when the transaction is fully processed. Be mindful of potential fluctuations, especially for larger transactions. Security: While Uniswap Wallet is self-custodial, you are still interacting with third-party providers for fiat off-ramping. Ensure you are using reputable providers and practice good security hygiene when managing your accounts and transactions. The Future of DeFi and Fiat Accessibility Uniswap Wallet’s integration of fiat currency exchange is a significant step forward for the DeFi space. It addresses a critical pain point for many users – the often-complex process of moving between the crypto and traditional financial systems. By simplifying crypto to fiat conversions, Uniswap is contributing to: Mainstream Adoption: Making crypto more user-friendly and accessible is crucial for wider adoption. Fiat off-ramping removes a significant barrier for newcomers and casual users. Real-World Utility: This feature enhances the real-world utility of cryptocurrencies. It becomes easier to use crypto earnings for everyday expenses, making them more practical in daily life. DeFi Ecosystem Growth: As DeFi becomes more integrated with traditional finance, it fosters a more robust and interconnected financial ecosystem. Fiat on/off-ramps are essential infrastructure for this growth. Conclusion: Embracing a Seamless Crypto-Fiat Future The introduction of fiat off-ramping in the Uniswap Wallet is a revolutionary development. It marks a significant leap towards bridging the gap between the decentralized world of crypto and the traditional financial system. By partnering with established providers like Robinhood, Transak, and MoonPay, Uniswap is empowering users with unprecedented convenience and control over their crypto assets. This update not only simplifies the user experience but also paves the way for greater mainstream adoption and real-world application of cryptocurrencies. As the DeFi space continues to evolve, features like seamless fiat off-ramping will be instrumental in shaping a more accessible and user-centric financial future.

But don’t worry, this isn’t a retreat, but a bold leap forward! Get ready for TikTok One, a groundbreaking platform supercharged with cutting-edge AI tools , poised to redefine how brands and content creators collaborate. For those in the crypto and blockchain space, understanding these social media evolutions is crucial as marketing strategies increasingly blend with online content creation. Let’s dive into what this powerful transition means for the future of digital engagement. Why is TikTok Replacing the Creator Marketplace with TikTok One? TikTok’s Creator Marketplace, while functional, was somewhat limited in scope. Think of it as a first-generation solution. TikTok One , on the other hand, is envisioned as a comprehensive ecosystem. The move signals TikTok’s ambition to provide a more integrated and intelligent suite of tools for businesses and content creators . Here’s a breakdown of the key reasons behind this upgrade: Enhanced Functionality: Creator Marketplace was primarily a directory to connect brands and creators. TikTok One expands this to offer a broader range of services, including trend analysis, creative inspiration, and AI-driven content creation tools. AI-Powered Intelligence: The core differentiator is the deep integration of artificial intelligence. TikTok One leverages AI to offer intelligent assistance in script generation, video editing, ad optimization, and more – features absent in the original marketplace. Streamlined Workflow: By consolidating various tools and resources into a single platform, TikTok aims to simplify the campaign creation and management process for both brands and creators. Future-Proofing for Social Media Marketing: This move reflects the growing importance of AI in digital marketing. TikTok is positioning itself at the forefront of this evolution, offering tools that are not just current but also future-ready. Essentially, TikTok is moving from a simple matchmaking service to a sophisticated, AI-enhanced creative and social media marketing hub. Unpacking the Power of TikTok One’s AI Tools The real excitement around TikTok One lies in its arsenal of AI tools . These aren’t just gimmicks; they are designed to genuinely enhance the creative process and marketing effectiveness. Let’s explore some of the standout AI-driven features: Symphony Assistant: Your AI Co-Pilot for TikTok Creativity Imagine having an AI assistant specifically tailored for TikTok content creation. That’s precisely what Symphony Assistant offers. This feature helps users: Summarize Trends: Quickly grasp trending topics and themes on TikTok, ensuring your content stays relevant and timely.

Intelligent Ad Optimization: Receive AI-driven suggestions to refine and enhance ad performance, maximizing ROI. Script Generator: Develop TikTok video scripts for ads by simply providing product details, industry information, and other relevant inputs. What Happens to Existing Creator Marketplace Data? TikTok understands the importance of data continuity. Ahead of the Creator Marketplace shutdown, they are actively encouraging advertisers to migrate their valuable data. Here’s what you need to know about the transition process: Data Migration Encouraged: TikTok is urging users to transfer data from the Creator Marketplace and the TikTok Creative Challenge dashboard to TikTok One. Seamless Transition: The goal is to make the migration as smooth as possible, ensuring minimal disruption for ongoing campaigns and creator relationships. Preparation is Key: Advertisers should proactively take steps to migrate their data to ensure they can continue their activities seamlessly on TikTok One. The Benefits of TikTok One for Brands and Creators This transition to TikTok One is packed with potential benefits for both brands and content creators .

Enhanced Creativity: AI assistance can spark new ideas and push creative boundaries, leading to more innovative and impactful campaigns. Improved ROI: Smarter ad optimization and more targeted content creation can translate to better campaign performance and a higher return on investment. Data-Driven Decisions: Access to trend tracking and performance analytics within TikTok One allows for more informed and strategic marketing decisions. For Content Creators: Expanded Opportunities: TikTok One’s broader scope may lead to more diverse and lucrative collaboration opportunities with brands. Creative Empowerment: AI tools can assist creators in refining their content, experimenting with new formats, and enhancing their production quality. Streamlined Collaboration: A centralized platform simplifies the process of connecting with brands, managing campaigns, and accessing resources.

The bill is designed to address ethical concerns over conflicts of interest and the use of public office for personal gain. Although the proposal faces steep political challenges, it sparks a broader debate on transparency and accountability in digital finance. The discussion reflects growing calls for clearer regulatory boundaries in a market where politics and cryptocurrency increasingly intersect. ABC News reported Thursday that House Democrats are preparing new legislation. Led by Congressman Sam Liccardo (D-CA), they plan to introduce the Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement (MEME) Act. The bill would bar senior U.S. officials and their family members from issuing, sponsoring, or endorsing digital assets, securities, futures, and commodities—specifically in response to President Donald Trump’s recent involvement with the $TRUMP meme coin. Details of the MEME Act According to the February 27 report , Liccardo and his Democratic Party constituents plan to introduce the Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement (MEME) Act, which would prohibit top U.S. officials and their family members from profiting off cryptocurrencies. Let’s make corruption criminal again. #SipWithSam #MEMEAct pic.twitter.com/J4sRcMdXv0 — Rep. Sam Liccardo (@RepLiccardo) February 27, 2025 The MEME Act is unlikely to pass in the current Republican-controlled Congress. However, its prospects could improve if Democrats retake control in the 2026 midterm elections, potentially forcing Trump to return any profits from his namesake cryptocurrency. “Let’s make corruption criminal again,” Liccardo told reporter John Parkinson. “Our public offices belong to the public, not the officeholders—nor should they leverage their political authority for financial gain.” “The Trumps’ issuance of meme coins financially exploits the public for personal gain, and raises the specter of insider trading and foreign influence over the Executive Branch,” he added. Donald Trump Faces Meme Coin Criticism The meme coin $TRUMP debuted just days before the U.S. presidential inauguration, launching alongside $MELANIA, a token tied to now-First Lady Melania Trump. Shortly after its release, $TRUMP surged to over $74 before experiencing a sharp decline, mirroring the drop in the value of $MELANIA. According to CoinGecko , $TRUMP is down 82 percent from its all-time high last month, while $MELANIA has fallen by 93 percent. The U.S. President and First Lady have previously launched branded NFTs , continuing their involvement in Web3. Despite Trump’s crypto-friendly regulatory stance, the Trumps’ meme coins have faced criticism online and in political circles due to substantial investor losses. “Last cycle we had NFTs, so Trump sold NFTs. This cycle we have meme coins,” Variant Fund CLO Jake Chervinsky said in a January 2025 X post. “Is $TRUMP seriously a surprise to you?” Restoring Confidence in Public Service Trust in governance depends heavily on separating personal gain from political authority—a line increasingly blurred by crypto-related ventures like $TRUMP. Though Liccardo’s MEME Act faces an uphill battle, its introduction itself highlights a pressing dilemma: How much influence should politicians wield in speculative digital markets? The answer will shape not just cryptocurrency policy but the credibility of democratic institutions. Ultimately, preserving public confidence may require decisive action far beyond symbolic legislation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What ethical concerns does the proposed bill raise? The measure highlights worries about public officials potentially using their office to secure personal financial benefits through digital tokens. Such a mix of public duty and private profit could erode trust in government decision-making and blur the lines of accountability. How might restricting political involvement in meme coins affect the cryptocurrency market? By limiting political figures from endorsing or profiting from meme coins, the proposal could reduce market volatility driven by speculative hype and conflict of interest. However, some observers argue that the impact might be largely symbolic given the challenging legislative environment. Are there alternative approaches to managing conflicts of interest in political finance related to digital assets? Experts suggest that, aside from outright bans, enhanced disclosure requirements and independent oversight mechanisms could offer a path to greater transparency. These alternatives might help ensure that personal financial interests do not compromise public service, fostering a more accountable framework. What potential impact could this legislation have on public trust in government? If elected officials are seen to profit from speculative digital assets, public confidence in their commitment to serving the common good may decline. This concern fuels calls for reform, as maintaining clear boundaries between public duty and personal enrichment is essential for democratic legitimacy. How does this legislative effort fit into the larger context of cryptocurrency regulation? The proposal reflects a broader debate about the need for regulatory clarity in digital markets. By targeting practices that merge political power with speculative investments, the measure may serve as a precursor to more comprehensive rules designed to ensure that emerging financial technologies operate with greater ethical oversight.

A new bill aims to prevent top government officials, including the president, from issuing or endorsing cryptocurrencies, following concerns over the recent decline of the $TRUMP meme coin.

As investors hunt for the next big opportunity, RCOF is positioning itself as a revolutionary force in decentralized finance, offering cutting-edge technology and investor-friendly features that set it apart. The Unmatched Appeal of RCO Finance (RCOF) RCO Finance (RCOF) has captured the attention of seasoned traders and institutional investors thanks to its innovative ecosystem designed for efficiency and profitability. Unlike many other altcoins, RCOF introduces an AI-powered robo advisor that revolutionizes investment strategies. This advanced tool analyzes real-time market trends and applies machine learning to identify high-potential assets before they take off. Its predictive capabilities ensure that RCOF investors stay ahead of the curve, making it one of the top altcoins to hold in the coming months. Beyond AI-driven trading, RCOF offers unparalleled accessibility. The platform’s no-KYC policy ensures privacy-focused transactions, making it a go-to choice for investors who value anonymity. Security remains a top priority, with comprehensive smart contract audits conducted by the reputable blockchain security firm SolidProof.

Investors gain exposure to over 120,000 tradable instruments, including tokenized real-world assets such as real estate, commodities, stocks, and bonds. This diversification allows RCOF holders to mitigate risks while maximizing their investment potential, further solidifying its position as one of the top altcoins to hold in March 2025.

These features make RCO Finance more than just another altcoin; it’s a comprehensive investment solution that caters to both short-term traders and long-term investors. RCOF incorporates deflationary mechanisms designed to enhance its value over time. The platform actively burns unsold tokens during its presale stages, reducing overall supply. This strategic approach boosts long-term price appreciation, making it a standout option among the top altcoins to hold in 2025. Recent developments have only added to RCOF’s momentum. The platform’s beta launch was met with overwhelming enthusiasm, attracting over 10,000 new users. With its upcoming alpha release, RCO Finance plans to introduce additional enhancements, including an advanced monitoring tool for its AI Robo Advisor.

So far, over $13.5 million has been raised, with the next price phase at $0.13 rapidly approaching. Investors who secure their positions now benefit from significant price appreciation upon listing. Market analysts project that RCOF could trade between $0.40 and $0.60 post-listing, presenting an ROI of over 800% for early adopters. Some forecasts even anticipate a 19,000% price surge, elevating RCOF to the ranks of the most profitable altcoins in recent history. Furthermore, RCOF holders gain access to exclusive perks, including AI-powered analytics, DeFi lending services, trading fee discounts, and governance rights within the ecosystem.

There’s a direct line from the efficient markets theory of Eugene Fama in the 1960s to modern portfolio theory. It paved the way for index funds, a strategy that has not only weathered market cycles but also become the default for managing pensions and retirement accounts. As we step into a new era of digital finance, tokenized assets may offer a way to broaden our investment horizons in ways that traditional models have overlooked. The genesis of modern portfolio theory Index fund investing didn’t arise by chance. In the early 1970s, amid vigorous debates over market efficiency, Burton Malkiel’s seminal work advocating index funds in 1973 (in his book “A Random Walk Down Wall Street” ) was embodied in John Bogle’s launch of the Vanguard S&P 500 fund in 1975. This cemented a strategy that focused on broad diversification and minimal trading. Astonishingly, passive index-investing has triumphed around the world, even though the theory underpinning it, that investors are always rational, hasn’t held up well. Behavioral psychologists like Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky illuminated the flaws in our decision-making processes. This is highlighted in Daniel Kahneman’s award winning book, “Thinking Fast and Slow.” In the ensuing decades, economists have reconciled efficient markets and irrational behavior into the concept of “pretty good markets.” Aggregated wisdom in the form of prices trends towards being right, over time, though from day to day and case to case there are significant gaps that investors can exploit. Index funds have held up well because exploiting those opportunities is hard to do consistently or cheaply. At the same time, the regulatory framework governing institutional investing reinforces this reliance on proven strategies. Fund managers operate under strict fiduciary duties that require them to prioritize client interests and mitigate risk. As a result, they allocate the bulk of their portfolios to assets with long, established track records, typically government bonds and passive equity funds. In short, the criteria for “acceptable” investments aren’t driven solely by potential returns; they are fundamentally tied to data history, reliability, and transparency. In case you were wondering, that means index funds. In this environment, venturing into uncharted territory is not taken lightly. New asset classes, no matter how promising, are initially sidelined because they lack the long-term, daily data that makes them viable for inclusion in a fiduciary portfolio. Until now, almost all portfolio theory has been based on U.S. equities and government bonds. Although that universe has expanded over time to include index funds and bonds from other large economies, it still represents only a relatively small portion of the world’s assets. Portfolios are constrained at the intersection of regulations and data. And that’s all going to change. Tokenization: Expanding the universe of investable assets Tokenization and on-chain transactions don’t just offer a scalable way to package any kind of asset. They also offer a path to transparent, comparable data on asset values. By representing real-world assets, whether it’s Thai real estate, Nigerian oil leases, or New York taxi medallions as digital tokens on a blockchain, we can begin to generate the kind of daily, market-derived data that has traditionally been reserved for a narrow set of assets. Consider a simple question: How much Thai real estate should feature in a diversified retirement portfolio? Under current models, the answer is obscured by a lack of reliable, continuous pricing data. But if Thai real estate were tokenized, establishing an on-chain market with daily closing prices, it could eventually be measured against the same metrics used for U.S. equities. In time, this would force a re-examination of the static, index-based approach that has dominated investment strategy for so long. The implications for global finance Right now, alternative strategies – as pension fund managers refer to anything that isn’t a stock or bond index – comprise no more than 15–20% of most funds. Changing academic data on investment options would put the other 80% up for grabs. Imagine a future where a truly diversified portfolio isn’t limited by the confines of traditional equity and debt markets. With tokenization, investors from large institutional funds to individual savers could gain exposure to asset classes and geographic regions previously ignored due to data scarcity or illiquidity. The principles that underpin modern portfolio theory wouldn’t be discarded. Rather, they would be expanded upon to include a broader range of risk and return profiles. As tokenized assets build track records, fiduciaries, who today favor the predictability of bonds and index funds, might find themselves compelled to recalibrate their strategies. It’s not that the pretty good market hypothesis will be rendered obsolete. Instead, the parameters of what constitutes “efficient” may widen considerably. A richer dataset could lead to better-informed risk assessments and, ultimately, to portfolios that capture a more accurate picture of global value. A Measured but inevitable shift This isn’t going to happen overnight. The fastest we’re likely to see changes emerge is about a decade, assuming time to build a wide portfolio of tokenized assets and 5-7 years to build a daily information track record. Once the data is present, however, change could come quickly, thanks to widespread use of artificial intelligence. One thing that often slows the spread of change is a lack of intellectual bandwidth on the part of fund managers and consumers to adapt to new data. It took about 40 years to move pension fund investors from a 95%+ bonds model in the 1950s to a majority equity index fund model in the 1990s. It took about 30 years for index funds to become the dominant equity investment vehicle after the evidence showed they were the best option. In a world of AI-driven automated investment tools, the transition might happen a whole lot faster. And with hundreds of trillions of dollars in assets under management, every percentage point change in allocation strategy is a little tsunami of change by itself.

The feature is facilitated through integrations with MoonPay, Robinhood, and Transak. This development will simplify the conversion of digital assets into fiat currency, improving accessibility for users in over 180 countries. Uniswap Labs Integrates Robinhood, MoonPay for Crypto-to-Bank Transfers In a recent post on X, Uniswap Labs announced the rollout of its fiat off-ramp feature, enabling users to convert crypto holdings into cash and withdraw funds directly into their bank accounts. This service is integrated with Robinhood, MoonPay, and Transak, providing a streamlined process for users looking to move between crypto and traditional finance. The new off-ramp is available in over 180 countries, broadening UNI platform’s global reach. The feature is accessible through the Uniswap wallet on both iOS and Android. More so, there are plans to extend support to the UNI platform browser extension and website. By integrating with multiple fiat on-ramp providers, Uniswap Labs will offer a flexible way for users to manage crypto transfers. Users can swap supported ERC-20 tokens, including USDC and ETH, before withdrawing their converted funds to bank accounts. According to Uniswap, the process is designed to be completed in seconds, reducing delays commonly associated with crypto-to-bank transfers. The integration with Robinhood, MoonPay, and Transak ensures broad coverage across different regions, increasing accessibility. This move comes just days after the US SEC dropped its Uniswap case, marking another shift in the regulator’s approach to the crypto industry. The UNI platform stated that the case closure reaffirms its compliance with federal laws and its commitment to a transparency. Expansion of Features With Unichain The fiat off-ramp follows the UNI platform recent introduction of Uniswap v4 and Unichain, a Layer 2 network designed to improve scalability. These updates will offer users more efficient trading and transaction capabilities. Uniswap v4 introduces customizable hooks, which allow developers to create more efficient trading strategies on the platform. Meanwhile, Unichain Layer 2 is expected to reduce gas fees and improve transaction speeds, boosting UNI price with new technologies. Uniswap Labs move comes as other crypto wallets, such as MetaMask, expand their fiat off-ramp services. MetaMask recently integrated with Transak to support fiat withdrawals across multiple blockchains. This reflects a growing trend among DeFi platforms to bridge the gap between crypto and traditional banking.

However, it faces its toughest challenge amidst falling network activity and a price slump. According to an analyst, Dogecoin experienced a massive 95% drop in active addresses on its network, suggesting a considerable decline in activity.

As Dogecoin’s price starts to recover, its network activity suffered. Crypto expert Ali Martinez notes the decline in the network activity, sharing that the drop in the number of active addresses began three months ago. According to Martinez, the Dogecoin network registered 1,292,770 new active addresses by November 21st, 2024. The number soon surged to 2.4 million active addresses, but this number immediately dropped. Between December 2024 and February 2025, the number of addresses dropped by around 95%. Meanwhile, Dogecoin’s price has declined substantially in the last few days, with holders incurring losses. The popular meme coin is currently trading at $0.2077, a slight improvement from its $0.1977 price a few hours ago. Despite DOGE’s minimal gains, it’s still down from last week’s performance. Drop In Network Activity On February 23rd, it was noted that the network only had 30,815 new addresses, confirming the slide in network activity. The decrease in Dogecoin’s network activity was reflected in its price movement, which dipped from $0.4868 to $0.196. With price dipping and a decline in network activity, many commentators argued it’s a sign of weak demand for Dogecoin. According to one data, there’s a 2.67% decline in the percentage of long-term Dogecoin investors, which means a less accumulation. Also, there’s a drop of 11.81% in mid-term coin holders, meaning they have already exited their positions. Finally, the data indicates a 107.45% increase in short-term holders, which suggests an increase in speculative trading. This information shows that Dogecoin traders are more interested in short-term and speculative trading activities than long-term investment. DOGE is starting its big move!

Whales Buy 530 Million DOGE appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Amid the ongoing bearish price momentum, Dogecoin (DOGE), the largest and most popular meme coin, has been gaining significant attention from crypto enthusiasts due to its notable price drop in recent days. Crypto Whales Buy 530 Million DOGE On February 28, 2025, a prominent crypto expert shared a post on X (formerly Twitter), revealing that during the past three days of DOGE’s price decline, whales have bought the dip, accumulating a significant 530 million DOGE. https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1895217845186724299 DOGE’s on-chain data shows that it has experienced a price drop of over 17% during the period when whales bought the dip. It appears that they began accumulating after the breakdown of the crucial support level at $0.238. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Action and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, DOGE appears bearish but has been consolidating in a tight range near the crucial support level of $0.175 for the past two trading days. Based on recent price action and historical patterns, DOGE still seems bearish and could drop another 15% in the future. Source: Trading View As of now, the asset is trading below the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe, indicating a downtrend. Current Price Momentum and Decline of Open Interest DOGE is currently trading near $0.206 and has experienced a modest price surge of over 1.75% in the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, its trading volume dropped by 30%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors, possibly due to the significant price fluctuations the meme coin has witnessed in recent days. With the bearish market outlook, data from the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass revealed that intraday and derivative traders appear to be abandoning DOGE, as its futures open interest (OI) has dropped to its lowest level in 2025.

The meme coin market is boiling with action, and traders are scrambling to get in before the next explosion. Apu Apustaja (APU) is feeling the heat, dropping 22.29% in the past week, despite a 7.27% increase in trading volume. Meanwhile, Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) is making waves, climbing 10.26% in just seven days, catching the attention of meme coin degens. But the real spotlight is on BTFD Coin (BTFD), where whales are aping in fast thanks to its 90% APY staking rewards and a massive 3650% ROI potential. With a presale tally of $6.21M and over 11,100 holders, BTFD Coin is dominating the meme coin conversation. Let’s break down why this meme-fueled rocket might be the best meme coin to buy today . BTFD Coin (BTFD) – 90% APY Staking and a 3650% ROI Potential Why are investors rushing to grab BTFD before it moons? Simple—this isn’t just another meme coin, it’s a whole movement. The Bulls Squad, now over 11,100 strong, is laser-focused on staking rewards, play-to-earn (P2E) gaming, and a 3650% ROI moonshot. It’s no wonder why BTFD Coin is dominating discussions as the best meme coin to buy today. The 90% APY staking feature is a game-changer. Investors aren’t just holding BTFD; they’re multiplying their stacks at an insane rate. Staking offers passive income, meaning even before the price skyrockets post-listing, holders are raking in rewards. Now, let’s talk numbers. If an investor drops $2,000 into BTFD at the current presale price of $0.00016, they’d be holding 12.5 million BTFD tokens. Once BTFD hits $0.0006 at listing, that bag would be worth $7,500—nearly 4x the investment before even factoring in staking rewards. And if BTFD blasts to its projected $0.006 moon price, that’s a 3650% ROI, turning $2,000 into a jaw-dropping $75,000. It’s easy to secure BTFD before the presale price jumps. Set up MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load it with BNB, ETH, or USDT, and head to the presale page . Enter the amount of BTFD you want, apply the 100% BONUS CODE (LAUNCH100) to double your tokens, confirm the purchase, and boom—you’re officially part of the Bulls Squad. But here’s where it gets even crazier: BTFD skipped Stage 13, burning all unsold tokens. With a tightening supply and skyrocketing demand, this presale is heating up fast. If you’re still on the sidelines, now’s the time to act—this is hands down the best meme coin to buy today. Apu Apustaja (APU) Sees Volume Surge Despite Price Drop Apu Apustaja, the Pepe-variant meme coin, has had a rough week, dropping 22.29%. However, its trading volume has jumped 7.27%, showing that traders are still keeping an eye on it. Despite its price dip, Apu Apustaja has a loyal community of investors who believe in its long-term value. Unlike low-effort meme coins that get rugged, APU’s fully transparent and fairly launched nature has kept holders engaged. With its fair launch philosophy and organic meme appeal, Apu Apustaja remains a wild card in the meme coin space. Whether it bounces back or consolidates further will depend on its next market moves and how its community rallies. Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) Pumps 10.26% and Gains Market Momentum Fartcoin might have started as a joke, but its recent performance is no laughing matter. The coin has seen a 10.26% price surge in just one week, backed by a 0.76% increase in trading volume. Built on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain, Fartcoin has been picking up steam in the DEX space, where traders are swapping it aggressively. Some early adopters are already seeing solid gains, making it one of the most talked-about meme coins this week. Fartcoin’s real strength lies in its growing trader base and memetic power. As long as it keeps its momentum, it could remain a trending pick for meme coin degens looking for short-term flips. The Final Thoughts Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin stands out as the best meme coin to buy today. While Apu Apustaja battles price volatility and Fartcoin gains short-term traction, BTFD’s 90% APY staking and 3650% ROI potential make it the most compelling investment opportunity right now. The Stage 14 price of $0.00016 won’t last much longer, and with BTFD set to list at $0.0006, this is the perfect dip to buy before it takes off. The 100% BONUS CODE (LAUNCH100) won’t be around forever—this is a limited-time chance to double your tokens and secure a front-row seat for BTFD’s moon mission.

Founding members of HumanAIx include: OORT, Neo, Storj, Oasis Protocol, YGG, io.net, XYO, AI.KIDO, DeTaSECURE, Unyt, Holo, Valdi, Supermoon. As AI advances rapidly, the three core pillars of AI development—compute, storage, and data—continue to face significant challenges including high costs, energy consumption, scalability limitations, and centralization, which restrict accessibility and efficiency. On the storage side, handling large data volumes and associated transfer costs continues to be a challenge. Meanwhile, data acquisition often raises ethical and legal concerns, with frequent violations of privacy rights. Data labeling further exacerbates the issue, relying on underpaid workers in poor working conditions, creating serious human rights concerns. Additionally, individuals who contribute data rarely receive fair compensation or incentives. Overcoming these challenges is important for the industry's long-term sustainability and ethical development. HumanAIx is an open protocol that seamlessly connects partners—each contributing critical components such as validation, storage, compute, and data—to create a decentralized AI infrastructure that is permissionless, scalable, and verifiable. It is built on a three-layer architecture, consisting of an interface layer, a protocol layer (which integrates compute, storage, and data), and a security layer. This initiative harnesses industry expertise and knowledge to collaboratively build an open environment for the future of decentralized AI. ""We believe AI should create more benefits than constraints for humanity. With the launch of HumanAIx, we are fostering a decentralized movement to ensure AI remains human-centric and serves the broader community,"" said Michael Robinson, Chairman of OORT Foundation. ""We are thrilled to collaborate with like-minded visionaries and excited to develop initiatives that better serve the AI community, ultimately building a truly human-centric ecosystem."" ""At Neo, we believe that a decentralized, interoperable future is key to unlocking AI’s full potential. By joining HumanAIx, we are contributing to an open, verifiable AI infrastructure that empowers developers and businesses alike—one that is transparent, scalable, and accessible to all,"" said John Wang, Head of Neo Ecosystem Growth. “This HumanAIx marks a significant milestone in democratising access to high-quality AI models and incentivising human contribution in AI. By combining OORT’s robust infrastructure with our security expertise at DeTaSECURE and EigenLayer’s innovative restaking mechanism, we’re creating an ecosystem that ensures transparency, reliability and economic sustainability in AI industry.”said Tamaghna Basu, Founder, CEO & CTO of DeTaSECURE. ""The future of AI depends on diverse, high-quality human input, and YGG is joining HumanAIx to ensure that AI is built with—and for—real people. By empowering a global community to refine and enhance AI data in a decentralized way, we’re creating new opportunities for digital work while keeping AI open, fair, and aligned with human interests."" said Beryl Li, Co-Founder of YGG. ""At XYO, we are driven by the vision of blending blockchain, data and AI to unlock human potential in meaningful ways. HumanAIx offers a unique opportunity to foster collaboration and build systems that prioritize fairness, authenticity, and real-world impact while ensuring data integrity. We’re proud to join forces with forward-thinking partners to shape a future where technology amplifies human agency and innovation thrives."" said Markus Levin, XYO Co-Founder. “While everyone is just talking about ‘Bring AI to people’, ‘Make Web3 AI truly decentralized’, HumanAIx has a real impact by uniting the brightest minds of the web3 AI sector. By stepping into this alliance with AI.KIDO we're significantly boosting our efforts to put the responsibility for AI markets into the hands of real people.” said Pavlo Karapinka, Co-Founder of AI.KIDO. “We are impressed with the collaborative and human-centric approach to AI taken by HumanAIx. It’s imperative that AI develops as a tool for all and by all, and this initiative is a unique opportunity to make this goal a reality. We are excited to work closely with our partners to build and realise the vision of this open ecosystem.” said Alastair Ong, Director at Holo.

While institutional investors are increasingly backing Bitcoin, not every investor is focused solely on BTC for substantial returns. Yet, not all investors are focusing on BTC— Web3Bay is quickly becoming the center of attention. While Bitcoin leads the market, Web3Bay’s rise is stealing the spotlight. The decentralized e-commerce platform raised $200,000 within 24 hours, marking a milestone in its presale. With rapid sales and a unique Web3 model, Web3Bay stands out as one of the top altcoins to buy now, showing massive potential in 2025. Bitcoin’s Gains Strength With Strategy₿’s Bullish Bet Bitcoin’s jump above $95,000 marks a solid comeback after losses caused by the LIBRA coin crash, which erased $4.4 billion in market value. Despite setbacks, Bitcoin remains the strongest crypto, with institutions rapidly increasing their holdings. On February 18, 2025, Michael Saylor, executive chairman of Strategy₿ (formerly MicroStrategy), revealed the company’s $2 billion private offering. Raised through convertible senior notes due in 2030, the funds will buy more Bitcoin and support long-term growth. Saylor highlighted Bitcoin’s growing role in corporate finance, comparing its value to high-end real estate. He noted that Bitcoin is no longer just a speculative asset but a core part of Strategy₿’s expansion strategy, even using BTC as collateral for new projects. With institutions strengthening their Bitcoin positions, analysts see this as a signal of long-term growth, suggesting that the current dip offers a chance to buy. However, as Bitcoin’s growth slows, many retail investors are turning to Web3Bay for faster gains. Web3Bay Raises $200K in 24 Hours— Is it the Next Market Giant? While Bitcoin rebounds, Web3Bay is capturing attention with its rapid growth. The decentralized e-commerce platform raised over $200,000 in a single day, pushing its presale total past $1.5 million as buyers rush to secure early-stage gains. Web3Bay aims to transform online shopping by cutting out middlemen, lowering costs, and giving users full control over their transactions. Unlike Amazon, eBay, and Shopify, which charge high fees and control user data, Web3Bay offers direct blockchain-based transactions. This real-world use case is fueling Web3Bay’s fast-selling presale. As interest in decentralized commerce grows, Web3Bay is positioned to lead the market. Now in Stage 4 of its presale, the 3BAY coin is priced at $0.004562. With each stage bringing a price increase, early buyers are locking in gains before the next jump. The rising demand and fast funding suggest Web3Bay could become one of the biggest success stories of the next bull run. Why Smart Investors Are Choosing Web3Bay Bitcoin remains a strong choice for long-term growth, but its large market cap limits its speed. While institutional adoption boosts its stability, it doesn’t offer the rapid gains that retail investors seek. This is why many are turning to Web3Bay, which offers both real-world use and high early-stage growth potential. First, Web3Bay’s presale gives buyers a chance to enter at low prices before demand drives up the cost. Unlike Bitcoin, which has already reached a trillion-dollar market cap, Web3Bay is still in its growth phase, offering more room for fast gains. Second, Web3Bay is solving real industry challenges, unlike short-lived meme coins. With more people seeking decentralized shopping, demand for 3BAY coins is expected to rise as the platform grows. Lastly, Bitcoin’s biggest gains are in the past, while Web3Bay is just beginning. Early Bitcoin buyers made life-changing profits, and Web3Bay now offers a similar early-stage opportunity. Time to Take Decision! Bitcoin’s rebound and Strategy₿’s $2 billion purchase show that institutional support for crypto is still strong. But for faster short-term gains, Web3Bay is emerging as a top choice. With $200,000 raised in 24 hours and a presale total above $1.5 million, Web3Bay is growing faster than most new projects in 2025. While Bitcoin is well-established, Web3Bay’s early phase gives buyers the best chance to lock in big returns before prices climb further. The next breakout crypto is here—get in before Web3Bay’s crypto presale stages sell out.

40934881,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=320395,1740704441,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/dailyhodl.png,Economist Alex Krüger Says Current Bitcoin Setup Looking Like Replica of Early 2024 – Here’s His Forecast,https://dailyhodl.com/2025/02/27/economist-alex-kruger-says-current-bitcoin-setup-looking-like-replica-of-early-2024-heres-his-forecast/,"A closely followed economist thinks that Bitcoin ( BTC ) may be repeating a similar pattern from last year and still has room to run to the upside. Alex Krüger tells his 206,800 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin’s latest severe correction is similar to when the flagship crypto asset collapsed to range lows in April 2024 before printing a series of rallies. However, he warns that the uncertainty around US President Donald Trump’s tariff polices remains a big risk for the crypto markets. “The dominant mood across crypto market participants is ‘it is over.’ For good reason. The Bitcoin dip is large, yet not extraordinary. But across alts the destruction is real. That said, I see this BTC chart as a replica of early 2024. Range lows are meant to be taken out (check the early 2024 range). Do need the Donald not to nuke us. The trigger for the last move down was precisely tariffs news (on Canada and Mexico).” Krüger also says Bitcoin may still hit lower price targets before rallying. “BTC is bottom of the range, akin to April 30th, 2024 in my opinion. Maybe we go lower, maybe we bounce. Don’t know, but it’s a good spot regardless.” He notes that severe Bitcoin corrections occur multiple times a year, and may present buying opportunities. “One can make a living just from getting good at buying liquidations. We get two-four such liquidations a year.” The economist previously said that investors should zoom out because he thinks crypto is amid a supercycle, which could include painful Bitcoin pullbacks. “BTC is stuck in a range, which I think eventually resolves higher. The supercycle theory is intact. Even though it applies to Bitcoin and crypto as a whole (market cap ex BTC and stables is considerably higher), most old alts don’t benefit from it on a sustained basis. Should not expect an insane wave of liquidity driving all cr*p higher for an extended period of time. Be selective.” Bitcoin is trading for $84,608 at time of writing, down 4.8% in the last 24 hours.

With major coins experiencing sharp declines, traders are now eyeing emerging projects that could offer substantial returns. The question is, where should one place their bets? Dogecoin (DOGE) has dropped significantly, shaking investor confidence, while Pepe Coin is struggling with high volatility. But amidst the downturn, one memecoin is making waves— Arctic Pablo Coin (APC). With a powerful presale structure, strong tokenomics, and a growing community, APC is positioning itself as the best crypto to buy now. This article will cover the latest developments in Arctic Pablo Coin (APC), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Pepe Coin (PEPE). Arctic Pablo Coin: The Strategic Tokenomics Powering Its Rise Tokenomics is the backbone of any cryptocurrency, and for Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC), it’s a game-changer. With a total supply of 221.2 billion APC, its structure is designed for long-term value and sustainability. The presale allocation rewards early adopters, while unsold tokens are strategically burned, ensuring supply control and potential price appreciation. Staking rewards are another major highlight, incentivizing holders to participate actively. This structure is not just about speculation—it’s about building a lasting ecosystem that thrives beyond the initial hype. Arctic Pablo Coin’s best crypto to buy now status comes from its carefully crafted supply model, ensuring that early investors benefit from controlled distribution and strategic growth mechanisms. Penguinopolis: The Arctic Pablo Presale is Entering an Exciting Phase! The Arctic Pablo Coin presale has reached Penguinopolis, the 12th phase, and the excitement is undeniable. Currently priced at $0.000067 per APC, early investors are looking at a potential 11,844.78% ROI when it hits the listing price of $0.008. With over $1.62 million already raised, the momentum is building rapidly. Each new phase marks a price increase, meaning every delay could mean missing out on massive potential gains. Penguinopolis isn’t just a stop—it’s a crucial turning point for those looking to enter at an optimal price. As the price continues its upward trajectory, those who act now could secure one of the most lucrative opportunities in the meme coin space. For anyone looking for the best crypto to buy now, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale offers a rare chance to get in before it reaches the mainstream spotlight. Dogecoin Faces a Steep Decline—Investors Seek Alternatives Dogecoin (DOGE) is experiencing a significant downturn, leaving investors uncertain about its future. Currently down nearly 40% this month, DOGE has slipped to $0.208 as of February 26—its lowest point since December. The downturn is driven by waning interest and the overall market slump, particularly Bitcoin’s recent dip below $90,000, dragging down altcoins like DOGE. Analysts warn that if the trend continues, DOGE could see further declines, possibly touching $0.20. With a negative sentiment surrounding its price action, many investors are exploring new projects that could deliver better returns. Pepe Coin: A Rapid Rise, But Can It Sustain the Momentum? Pepe Coin has been a sensation in the meme coin world, quickly climbing to a $1.6 billion market cap shortly after launch. With its strong community and meme-driven appeal, it initially seemed unstoppable. However, the typical challenges of meme coins—high volatility, lack of utility, and weak adoption—are now catching up with it. Experts predict that Pepe’s price, currently at $0.000009, could decline soon as investor sentiment shifts. Pepe Coin’s long-term viability remains uncertain with traders looking for projects with stronger fundamentals. As a result, some investors are already exploring newer, more structured opportunities in the meme coin space. Conclusion: The Memecoin Market is Changing—Arctic Pablo Coin Leads the Charge With Dogecoin struggling and Pepe facing uncertain prospects, the memecoin market is in flux. But instead of signaling the end, this shift presents a golden opportunity for new projects to take center stage. Arctic Pablo meme coin presale , currently at Penguinopolis with a price of $0.000067, stands out as a prime investment. With strategic tokenomics, staking incentives, and a growing community, APC is shaping up to be the best crypto to buy now. Don’t wait until it’s too late—Arctic Pablo Coin’s journey is just beginning, and those who get in now could see exponential gains. For More Information: Arctic Pablo Coin: https://www.arcticpablo.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/ArcticPabloOfficial Twitter: https://x.com/arcticpabloHQ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What makes Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) the best crypto to buy now? Arctic Pablo Coin offers a structured presale, strategic tokenomics, and strong staking incentives, making it a standout investment. With its price currently at $0.000067 in the Penguinopolis phase, early investors can secure high potential returns. How does Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale work? The APC presale moves through multiple phases, with each phase increasing the price. The current phase, Penguinopolis, marks one of the last low-price opportunities before the final listing at $0.008. Why is Dogecoin struggling in 2025? Dogecoin has seen a nearly 40% drop this month due to declining trader interest and a general market downturn. Its lack of strong fundamentals is causing investors to look for alternative meme coin opportunities. Is Pepe Coin still a good investment? Pepe Coin gained massive popularity but faces high volatility and no clear long-term adoption. With its price currently at $0.000009, experts predict it could drop further, prompting investors to seek projects with more structured growth potential. How high can Arctic Pablo Coin go after its presale? Based on its listing price of $0.008, early investors in the current Penguinopolis phase at $0.000067 could see an ROI exceeding 11,844.78%. Its staking rewards and controlled supply model further support strong post-listing performance.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $4.66 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $14.78. Tezos started out really strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Following the November 5 U.S. elections and the emergence of ex-president Donald Trump, crypto markets have responded positively, with Bitcoin prices moving above the $100k mark. Tezos also responded similarly, hitting a high of $1.85. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $0.752 Market cap $776,038,568.52 Trading volume $24,372,160.31 Circulating supply 1,032,312,440.52 XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3146 on December 7, 2018 24-hour low $0.7414 24-hour high $0.7853 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 9.54% 50-day SMA $1.044 14-Day RSI 29.66 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 10 (Extreme Fear) Green days 15/30 (50%) 200-day SMA $0.9629 Tezos price analysis: Will XTZ surge past $0.85 soon? TL; DR Breakdown XTZ has lost 0.70% in the last 24 hours. The coin’s support is at $0.748, and resistance is around $0.792. Tezos faced rejection at $0.787. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart: XTZ to surge past its 20-day SMA soon? The daily price analysis of the Tezos (XTZ) coin on February 28 shows consolidation in the last trading hours. XTZ’s value is currently around $0.75, having faced rejection at $0.787. XTZ to surge past its 20-day SMA soon? The MACD indicator, with a bearish crossover, also confirms the selling signal observed on the chart. The RSI (36.28) reflects a market approaching oversold conditions, suggesting buying opportunities at a discount. If buyers reenter the market, XTZ could surge past its 20-day SMA at $0.856. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart: XTZ appears range-bound The 4-hour chart shows recovery for XTZ, with the coin approaching the middle Bollinger Band, although resistance remains intact at $0.770. The Bollinger Bands are tightening, suggesting reduced potential volatility in the short term and possible price consolidation. XTZ appears range-bound The CMF indicator hovering around zero shows a neutral market, supporting the chances of XTZ consolidating. Meanwhile, the MFI also suggests oversold conditions, indicating ongoing cash outflow. If XTZ fails to stay above $0.748, it might move toward lower support levels. To confirm a recovery, XTZ must break above $0.770. Tezos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.9468 SELL SMA 5 $0.9123 SELL SMA 10 $0.9240 SELL SMA 21 $0.9018 SELL SMA 50 $1.0443 SELL SMA 100 $1.2125 SELL SMA 200 $0.9629 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.9246 SELL EMA 5 $0.9980 SELL EMA 10 $1.1126 SELL EMA 21 $1.2210 SELL EMA 50 $1.2529 SELL EMA 100 $1.1481 SELL EMA 200 $1.0276 SELL What to expect from XTZ price analysis next? Tezos (XTZ) is down to about $0.756 and looks oversold, which might mean a short-term bounce. But overall, it’s still in a bearish trend. If it breaks above $1.25, it could turn bullish, but if not, it might keep dropping. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs – so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your own research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Why is Tezos down? Tezos (XTZ) is down today after facing rejection at the $0.7616 resistance level, a move spurred by selloffs. XTZ price history Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $2 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications.

Tezos historic price sentiment Tezos price history ⏐ Source: Coinmarketcap Tezos mainnet went live in September 2018 and immediately gained popularity for dealing with the environmental impact of blockchain technologies at that time with its PoS model. XTZ’s price peaked during the bullish cycle of 2021, reaching above $9.0. After 4 April 2022, XTZ’s price plummeted below $4.0; by 9 May, it had sharply fallen below the $2 mark. XTZ surged to about $1 at the beginning of December 2022, but the bears reclaimed the market by the end of the month, resulting in a drop to $0.73. The coin made some recovery in 2023, averaging a market price of $0.8. Tezos (XTZ) had a largely bearish 2024 despite the partnership milestones achieved. The coin reached a high of $1.4 in April but lost about 60% by August. The bulls soon entered the market, and XTZ saw renewed buyer interest, which resulted in a peak price of $0.7015 in September and $1.856 in November. The surge extended into December—Tezos XTZ recorded a maximum price of $1.909. Price corrections followed thereafter, and the coin closed the year at $1.286. In January 2025, XTZ reached a maximum price of $1.49, but in February, it’s in the red zone, trading between $0.7414 and $0.7853.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,TRADING|XTZ|BUSINESS|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|FORKS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-28 01:30:55

Stripe bets big on stablecoins to transform payments This stance aligns with Stripe’s strategic moves, including its $1.1 billion acquisition of stablecoin startup Bridge in October. However, given that the company handles transactions equivalent to approximately 1% of global GDP, it’s worth exploring why co-founders Patrick and John Collison are betting on blockchain technology. According to their annual letter, the Collison brothers argued that stablecoins represent an “improvement” on the “basic usability of money,” much in the same way that banknotes were an advancement from coins and—perhaps more controversially among The Block readers—fiat currency was an upgrade from the gold standard. Stripe founders believe that stablecoins have four important properties relative to the status quo: They make money movement cheaper and faster, they are decentralized and open-access (and thus globally available from day one), and they are programmable. To be precise, fiat-pegged cryptocurrencies enhance traditional monetary functions and open new avenues for using money. “Improvements to the basic usability of money make economies more prosperous,” the Collison brothers write. Stripe’s stance on crypto has evolved over time. The company famously halted Bitcoin payments in 2018 after just a few years, citing blockchain limitations at the time. However, after a four-year hiatus, Stripe re-entered the crypto space by enabling payouts in USDC—a move that expanded two years later to allow customers to accept stablecoin payments on Solana, Ethereum, and Polygon. While the move may have been influenced by competitors like PayPal and Visa embracing crypto payments, the Collison brothers maintained that the industry’s maturation drove the decision—faster transaction speeds, lower costs, and stablecoins delivering “real utility.” The Stripe co-founders emphasized that years of research and careful systems engineering were required for decentralized technologies to become competitive with traditional financial infrastructure. According to their letter, the conditions for widespread stablecoin adoption have only recently come together. Stablecoins reshape the future of digital transactions The Collison brothers highlight that stablecoin transaction volumes more than doubled between Q4 2023 and Q4 2024, with over 40 million monthly active wallets now in use. They point out that stablecoins are increasingly used for real-world applications, including corporate treasury management, remittances, savings in countries with volatile currencies, and enabling payments in regions with low card penetration. Just as the Stripe co-founders credit much of the company’s success to their early investment in AI solutions, they believe that establishing a leadership position in stablecoin services could fuel Stripe’s next growth phase. While stablecoins are a win-win for Stripe and its client base, they also largely benefit the US government, as many stablecoin advocates have argued. Not only are nearly all stablecoins denominated in the U.S. dollar — strengthening the greenback’s economic hegemony — but issuers like Tether and Circle are among the largest buyers of U.S. government debt due to their need for low-risk treasury assets. As of the end of 2024, Tether has direct and indirect exposure to $113 billion in US government debt. According to Treasury Department data , if it were a nation-state, it would rank as the 19th-largest holder of U.S. Treasury bills. The Collison brothers believe that stablecoins, functioning as a more user-friendly and accessible version of eurodollars, have the potential to deliver similar benefits to a much wider range of participants. However, the subtitle of the stablecoin section in Stripe’s annual letter likened the asset class to “room-temperature semiconductors”—a groundbreaking innovation that, while theorized to be transformative, has yet to become a reality.

A dubious meeting app called ‘GrassCall’ was recently used to spread malware that drains the user’s crypto wallets. The fraud is allegedly carried out by a Russian hacker team known as “Crazy Evil.” This group of cybercriminals specializes in social engineering attacks that trick users into installing infected software on their Mac and Windows PCs. Crazy Evil commonly targets people in the crypto space, where they promote fake job opportunities and games via various social media websites. A cybersecurity company, Recorded Future , said that it has connected “over ten active scams on social media” to Crazy Evil. Hackers posted fake jobs for a sham company called ChainSeeker.io More recently, reports of another fake scam company surfaced. This time, the company was called ChainSeeker.io, according to an X user . According to the reports , threat actors created fake company profiles for ChainSeeker.io on LinkedIn, where they have been sending out premium job listings. Other popular job boards where the fake listing was spotted include CryptoJobList, and WellFound. Job listings by ChainSeeker (Source: choykwok on X) All those who applied for the jobs were contacted via email, which instructed them to contact the company’s marketing chief on Telegram. Scam emails sent out by ChainSeeker to all job applicants (Source: choykwok on X) The chief would then request the user download a video calling app named ‘GrassCall’ from a now-deleted website. Depending on the user’s browser, the website would offer them a Mac or Windows client. A screenshot of the since-flagged website of the malicious app (Source: BleepingComputer) After downloading the app, users are asked to enter a code shared by the CMO in the Telegram chat. The website then either provides a Mac “GrassCall_v.6.10.dmg” [VirusTotal] client or a Windows “GrassCall.exe” client [VirusTotal] client. Once the correct code is entered, both apps install an info stealer, like Rhadamanthys (on Windows), remote access trojans (RATs), or other malware. On Macs, the Atomic (AMOS) Stealer malware gets installed. Scammer providing GrassCall code to a potential victim (Source: choykwok on X) Once installed, the virus collects wallet addresses, authentication cookies, and passwords stored in the online browser and Apple Keychain. The stolen information gets uploaded to a server and gets posted on Telegram channels owned by the malicious actors. If a wallet is found, the hackers use a brute force method to crack the passwords and drain the user’s assets. From these assets, the hackers pay out the user who made the unsuspecting victim download the malicious app. According to publicly released payment information, Crazy Evil members apparently earn tens of thousands of dollars per victim. Crazy Evil’s Telegram channel showings its earnings per user (Source: G0njxa on X) Various users have recounted their experiences after applying to such scam job postings. Cristian Ghita, a LinkedIn user , posted on the platform, “It looked legit from almost all angles. Even the video-conferencing tool had an almost believable online presence.” The hackers have reportedly moved on to a social engineering new campaign Cybersecurity researcher, Gonjxa , has also identified dubious meeting apps called Gatherum, and VibeCall. Gatherum was used in previous campaign by a subgroup of Crazy Evil called “Kevland.” Interestingly, both apps’ branding is pretty much identical to GrassCall. Now, the scammers have moved on to their new campaign with VibeCall, which is currently being circulated among Web3 job seekers. In response to the attention this attack received online, Chain Seeker’s job postings have now reportedly been taken down by most of the job boards. Chainseeker.io website is now flagged in community databases LinkedIn search results do not return any job posts linked to Chainseeker.io anymore. At the same time, its website has been flagged in community databases for being suspicious. Furthermore, LinkedIn accounts of the company’s employees have all been deleted. Users who have already interacted with scammers or installed suspicious apps on their devices are advised to change their passwords and authentication tokens and move their crypto to fresh wallets as a precautionary measure. It is also recommended to turn on two-factor authentication via an authentication app on all websites that support this feature.

SHIB is currently trading near $0.0000143 and has recorded a modest price increase of over 0.50% in the past 24 hours. However, the meme coin has lost more than 22% of its value over the past 30 days. SHIB Price Action and Upcoming Level With this significant price drop, SHIB has recently retested a crucial support level at $0.000013, which has historically acted as a rebound zone. According to expert technical analysis, SHIB appears bearish and could decline by 20% in the coming days. This bearish outlook is driven by the prevailing negative market sentiment and the formation of a doji candle at the $0.000015 resistance level.

Why Investors Expect 6,000% Growth for MUTM",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/a-new-solana-at-just-0-015-why-investors-expect-6000-growth-for-mutm/,"The search for the next major crypto opportunity has led investors to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a decentralized lending protocol with strong fundamentals and real financial utility. While speculative assets rise and fall on hype, MUTM is positioning itself as a sustainable DeFi platform with an actual use case—allowing users to lend, borrow, and earn passive income. With its presale price at just $0.015, many investors see this as a chance to secure tokens at the lowest possible valuation before demand drives prices higher. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance offers a structured lending and borrowing model that is advantageous to both institutional and individual investors, in contrast to projects that just rely on speculation. Users can deposit their cryptocurrency assets into liquidity pools and get incentives depending on usage rates through peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending. However, by offering overcollateralized loans, borrowers can obtain money without having to liquidate their possessions. This process strengthens the token’s long-term worth by generating an ongoing demand cycle. Mutuum Finance also uses mtTokens, which are deposited assets that gradually earn income. When a user contributes Ethereum to the network, for instance, they earn mtETH, which automatically rises in value as interest accrues. This approach is a desirable substitute for conventional staking models since it provides a consistent flow of passive revenue. Presale Success and Price Growth Expectations The rapid momentum of Mutuum Finance’s presale is another strong indicator of investor confidence. In just a short time, over $1.5 million has been raised, with nearly 3,000 investors securing their stake in the project. With a launch price set at $0.06, early buyers are already positioned for a 400% gain before the token even hits exchanges. However, analysts predict that due to increasing adoption, utility-driven demand, and planned exchange listings, MUTM could see price levels exceeding $0.90 or higher, delivering the projected 6,000% growth over time. For instance, an investor would acquire 146,666 MUTM tokens if they invested $2,200 at a price of $0.015 per during the presale. Their investment would yield a 60x return, or $132,000, if the price hits $0.90. Given the strong fundamentals supporting this possibility, it’s simple to understand why early investors are rushing in. To support long-term value appreciation, Mutuum Finance implements a buy-and-distribute mechanism. A portion of platform revenue is used to buy back MUTM tokens, creating continuous buying pressure in the market. These tokens are then distributed to suppliers and liquidity providers, encouraging long-term holding while simultaneously reducing sell pressure. As more users engage with the platform, this system strengthens the token’s stability and overall growth potential. Another major catalyst for Mutuum Finance is its overcollateralized stablecoin, which will be introduced as part of the lending protocol. Mutuum’s stablecoin will be supported by on-chain collateral, guaranteeing security and transparency in contrast to centralized stablecoins that depend on currency reserves. In order to increase liquidity and preserve a solid peg to its value, borrowers will be able to mint the stablecoin against the assets they have deposited. Mutuum’s ecosystem is further improved by this innovation, which draws additional customers to its loan platform. Investors can win free MUTM tokens as part of a $100,000 promotion being held by Mutuum Finance. The goal of this campaign is to incentivize early backers and encourage more participation as the presale picks up steam. Complete information and eligibility requirements are accessible on the official website, where participants can enter by following easy instructions. With the presale gaining momentum and institutional interest growing, many believe that MUTM could be the next major player in DeFi lending. As it approaches launch, the time to enter at the lowest possible price is now, before it follows the trajectory of other successful DeFi projects and skyrockets in value.

Part of Metamask's revamped roadmap includes adding smart contract capabilities to its current wallet. At the moment, MetaMask is an Externally Owned Account (EOA), a type of wallet that is controlled by a public and a private key. One of the main downfalls with EOAs is that it is subject to human error, meaning if you forget your private key, you lose your crypto holdings in that account forever. The other type of wallet that exists on Ethereum are Contract Accounts (CAs), which are controlled by code and have recovery mechanisms in place and security checks for verifying transactions. In a blog post shared during ETHDenver, the largest North American Ethereum conference, the MetaMask team said “smart-contract-based accounts allow us to solve a number of problems: allowing new powerful uses of the assets you hold, while simultaneously improving security. When the user defines their terms from their own programmable account, we greatly expand how the user expresses their agency in ways that are enforced by their own code.” One of those new features aimed at making the user experience on MetaMask easier include ERC-5792, which builds on its current feature, smart transactions . Under ERC-5792, or known as batched transactions, users can combine certain steps when it comes to signing off transactions, like “approve + swap” in one click, meaning that they would save time and gas fees by batching those steps together. Dan Finlay, the co-founder of MetaMask, told CoinDesk that batching transactions “give us all the things you're going to ask for in order, we'll present them to the user in a nice, unified way. The user will pay for one gas fee for the series of events and then it'll just be one block for the whole series of operations.” MetaMask card The MetaMask team also shared that its MetaMask debit card will be available in select states in the U.S. starting mid-March. The card has been in production for a few months and was initially available just to users in the UK and EU. It connects to a user’s MetaMask wallet, letting them spend their crypto. “You can be earning staking rewards or yield on your favorite protocol with your favorite tokens and have those funds available to spend anywhere that Mastercard is accepted with just a tap,” the team wrote in a blogpost. More support As part of the theme of making the user-experience easier, the MetaMask team will be adding support for Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL) in its wallets, meaning users can hold their various crypto assets in one place. “So these are simultaneously delivering some of the most popular blockchains, but, but they're also ensuring that we have smoothed out every part of our interface that allows new blockchains to be added seamlessly,” Finlay said in the interview.

Bitcoin MVRV Z-Score Has Plunged Under Its 365-Day MA In a new post on X, CryptoQuant Head of Research Julio Moreno has talked about why Bitcoin may not have reached a bottom yet. “All valuation metrics are in correction territory,” notes the analyst. “It can take more time.” Related Reading: XRP Indicator Reliable Since 2022 Now Gives This Signal An indicator that Moreno has cited as an example of this trend is the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Z-Score. This metric basically tells us about how the market cap of the asset compares against its realized cap. The “realized cap” is an on-chain capitalization model that calculates the total value of the BTC supply by assuming that each token in circulation has its ‘true’ value equal to the spot price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain. In other words, the realized cap sums up the cost basis of the cryptocurrency’s supply. As such, the model can be interpreted as a measure of the total amount of capital the investors as a whole have put into BTC. Since the MVRV Z-Score compares the market cap, which represents the value the investors are holding right now, against this initial investment, it tells us about the profit-loss status of the cryptocurrency’s user base. The MVRV Z-Score is similar to the popular MVRV Ratio, but where it differs from the latter is that it also applies a standard deviation test to pull out the extremes from the data. Now, here is the chart shared by Moreno that shows the trend in the Bitcoin MVRV Z-Score, as well as its 365-day moving average (MA), over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin MVRV Z-Score has recently witnessed a sharp decline. The reason for this drawdown naturally lies in the crash that the asset’s price has just gone through, which has put many investors into a state of loss. Despite the plummet, though, the metric remains above the zero mark. Below this level, the overall market enters into a state of loss, so the boundary has historically proven to be an important one for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mega Whales The Primary Sellers During Price Crash, Analytics Firm Reveals An important level that the metric has indeed lost, however, is the 365-day MA. As the analyst has highlighted in the chart, past breakdowns of the line have generally led to notable periods of struggle for the Bitcoin price. It only remains to be seen how long BTC would have to stay under the level this time around, before its price reaches a bottom. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $86,300, down more than 11% over the last seven days.

Web3Bay is transforming online shopping by removing intermediaries, creating a marketplace where transactions are directly between buyers and sellers, and maintaining complete autonomy. Unlike conventional platforms burdened with hefty fees and restrictive data policies, Web3Bay utilizes smart contracts for transactions that are secure and transparent. While Chainlink and Polkadot have made strides in data linkage and blockchain interoperability, Web3Bay captures attention by tackling the inefficiencies of e-commerce, delivering financial fairness and autonomy to its users. Web3Bay Pioneers Decentralized E-commerce with Blockchain! The migration from traditional to blockchain-enabled marketplaces is accelerating, with Web3Bay leading by eradicating intermediaries and empowering buyers and sellers with full transaction control. Web3Bay diverges from centralized services that set rigid rules and high fees, offering a decentralized choice where transactions are protected by smart contracts and ownership transparency is a given. The foundational principles of Web3—ownership, transparency, and decentralization—are reshaping online commerce. Web3Bay leverages blockchain to allow sellers to keep a larger share of profits while buyers enjoy transparent pricing free of undisclosed fees. Escrow-backed smart contracts also minimize fraud and disputes, fostering a marketplace where trust prevails over corporate governance. Investor trust in Web3Bay is on the rise, as evidenced by its presale collecting $1.5 million so far. Now in Stage 4, the 3BAY token is valued at $0.00456, with a total of over 375 million tokens already purchased. As users increasingly seek autonomy in their dealings, Web3Bay is recognized as a beacon for financial fairness and autonomy in online shopping. Chainlink’s Journey: From Inception to Today Launched in 2017, Chainlink (LINK) set out to connect smart contracts with real-world data via a decentralized Oracle network. It debuted during its ICO at a price of $0.11 and gathered $32 million. The technology has since facilitated secure access to external data for smart contracts, crucial for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. As of February 19, 2025, LINK is trading at $18.04, marking an increase of more than 16,000% from its ICO, with a circulating supply of about 517 million tokens and a market cap of $9.33 billion. Its significant role in DeFi, securing assets valued at over $75 billion across various platforms, contributes to this success. Polkadot’s Development and Current Market Performance Polkadot (DOT), which started in May 2020, seeks to improve blockchain interoperability with its innovative multi-chain structure.

40937161,https://coingape.com/?p=241500,1740708923,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,US SEC Confirms Meme Coins Are Not Securities but Warns of Fraud,https://coingape.com/us-sec-confirms-meme-coins-are-not-securities-but-warns-of-fraud/,"The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has clarified that meme coins do not fall under federal securities laws. The agency stated that these digital assets are more like collectibles and are not subject to the regulations that apply to traditional financial instruments. However, the SEC warned that fraudulent activities related to meme coins could still lead to enforcement actions by other federal or state authorities. US SEC States Meme Coins Are Not Securities In a statement released on February 27, the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance stated that meme coins do not qualify as securities under the Securities Act of 1933. “It is the Division’s view that transactions in the types of meme coins described in this statement do not involve the offer and sale of securities under the federal securities laws,” the statement read. The agency explained that meme coins do not provide any rights to future income, profits, or assets, which are key factors in determining whether an asset is a security. It also noted that meme coins do not generate yield and are primarily driven by market speculation and social trends. The agency clarified that since meme coins do not meet the definition of securities, their issuers and traders do not need to register transactions with the agency. The statement emphasized that meme coin buyers and holders are not protected by securities laws. SEC Warns of Fraud in the Meme Coin Market Despite the clarification that they are not securities, the SEC warned that fraudulent activities in this sector could still face legal consequences. The agency noted that while it does not regulate meme coins under securities laws, other federal or state agencies may take action against deceptive practices. Khurram Dara, a lawyer at Bain Capital Crypto, pointed out that misleading promotions, scams, and fraudulent schemes involving meme coins could still be prosecuted. The agency also stated that it would continue to monitor the crypto market for any potential violations of financial regulations. “The offer and sale of meme coins do not involve an investment in an enterprise nor is it undertaken with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others,” the statement added. House Democrats Bill to Restrict Politicians Before the SEC’s statement, House Democrats had announced plans to introduce the Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement (MEME) Act. The proposed bill seeks to prevent public officials, including presidents and their families, from launching or endorsing meme coins. California Representative Sam Liccardo, who is leading the bill, stated that the legislation aims to stop political figures from profiting off meme coins. The move comes after President Donald Trump launched a meme coin named “TRUMP” shortly before taking office. The TRUMP token saw rapid gains but later experienced a sharp decline, losing over 50% of its value in the past month. The market reaction led to concerns about political figures using meme coins for financial gain. Crypto Industry Reacts to SEC’s Clarification The statement has been welcomed by some members of the crypto industry who have long sought regulatory clarity. Ishmael Green, a crypto attorney at Diaz Reus law firm, said the decision could encourage more investment in the U.S. crypto market. “This will drive continued investment in the U.S. crypto space, as the vast majority of meme coins launched in the last 12 months with multibillion-dollar market caps have been released on Solana, an American blockchain,” Green stated. Major crypto exchanges, including Coinbase and Robinhood , saw a slight rise in their stock prices following the agency’s announcement. Market analysts believe that the clarification could allow exchanges to list more meme coins without the risk of regulatory enforcement.

The exchange has been rocked this month by sanctions from the regulatory Financial Intelligence Unit and news of a tax probe from the National Tax Service . Upbit Stock: Prices ‘Plummet’ The FIU punished Upbit’s operator Dunamu with a three-month restriction order on the activities of new users after ruling that the platform mishandled thousands of KYC verifications. A ‘bogus social security card’ allegedly accepted by Upbit as part of its KYC checks on new customers. (Source: KBS News/Screenshot) The same body also ordered the dismissal of the company’s compliance and reporting leads. It will follow up at a later date with fines. The tax body, meanwhile, thinks that customers may have used the exchange to evade taxes by using Upbit to send their funds to overseas platforms. The platform is also in the political spotlight, with many lawmakers criticizing Seoul for allowing Upbit to become a “monopoly,” with over 70% of the domestic crypto market share. Further issues continue to dog the exchange, with regulators suggesting the exchange has failed to follow crypto “market rules.” Per the South Korean media outlet Nogaek , Upbit now finds itself under “sudden all-out pressure from the regulatory authorities.” And this pressure, the media outlet wrote, has “put the brakes on its rapid growth.” Quoting data from South Korean unlisted stock price data providers, Dunama shares “have been falling for the past three months.” The Upbit customer service center in Seoul, South Korea. (Source: KBS News/Screenshot) 30% Drop The providers say that Upbit prices have tumbled from 217,000 won on December 17, 2024, to 153,000 won in late February, a fall of almost 30%. The media outlet added that the latest investigations will see Upbit’s “overseas remittance and transaction history” placed under scrutiny. Investigators also want to probe Upbit’s operations in Singapore, Thailand, and Indonesia via its Southeast Asia subsidiaries. The outlet suggested that if Upbit is found guilty of tax offenses, punishments “may go beyond simple fines” and instead result in “criminal cases.” However, the media outlet also said that some experts had opined that Upbit’s current “crisis” could transform into “an opportunity for another leap forward.” Market experts said that if Upbit could “overcome” the hurdles it now faces, it is likely to return to “a strong growth path” and a stock price “rebound.” They added that they expected the crypto market to experience a “long-term growth curve.” Like many major crypto exchanges, Upbit’s financial performance is closely linked to Bitcoin (BTC) prices. Trading volumes on the Upbit crypto exchange over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko) Corporate Investment Hope? During previous BTC bull markets, Upbit’s performance improved as traders became more active on its platform. High trading volumes result in more commission fee-derived revenue for Upbit and many of its main competitors. The South Korean crypto market will also receive further stimulus this year, as regulators finally allow corporations to buy BTC using their balance sheets . Many domestic firms are highly likely to want to place orders via Upbit due to its perceived financial stability and market dominance. The media outlet wrote: “Regulatory scrutiny will have a negative impact on Upbit in the short term. But if Upbit is incorporated into the [financial] system and becomes established in the long term, analysts think this could actually become an opportunity for stable growth.” South Korean police are investigating the suspected crypto-linked murder of a Chinese man at a hotel on the island province of Jeju. #Jeju #SouthKorea https://t.co/7W3H0RpZIL — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) February 26, 2025 Will Upbit Convince Regulators It Can ‘Play Fair?’ The outlet concluded that if Upbit can convince regulators and politicians it will “play fair,” its stock price “will continue to rise.” Dunamu is thought to have previously explored the possibility of launching on the New York Stock Exchange.

Instead, its closest rival Bithumb is now leading the race to become the first South Korean crypto exchange to go public .

You can take advantage of the situation and make money, whether the price is falling or increasing. You can test the AI robo advisor using its recently released beta platform. Even though RCO Finance is in the presale stage, it has shipped the beta platform for users to test and grow their portfolios. Over 10,000 users are already using the platform and providing feedback. The RCO Finance team has promised more features and upgrades in their upcoming alpha version.

As the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap struggles to maintain its footing, the Ethereum price has dropped sharply, triggering a wave of uncertainty among traders. With the Ethereum price teetering near the $2,400 mark and facing its worst February since 2018, a $100 million sell-off has further exacerbated the situation. This dramatic downturn has left traders searching for alternative investments, and one rising star in the crypto world, RCO Finance (RCOF) , is quickly capturing attention. Ethereum Price Crash: A High-Stakes Battle Between Bulls and Bears The recent Ethereum price crash has put the market on edge, with traders closely monitoring a potential short squeeze that could either fuel a rebound or deepen the decline. Currently trading at $2,479, Ethereum faces a massive liquidation risk, with over $2 billion in short positions set to be wiped out if ETH climbs to $3,000. This could trigger a short squeeze, forcing bearish traders to cover their positions and accelerating the Ethereum price recovery. However, uncertainty looms. A failure to reach the $3,000 threshold could prolong bearish sentiment, potentially driving ETH below $2,150. Compounding this pressure, an early Ethereum ICO whale has been offloading holdings, selling over $24.5 million worth of ETH in recent days. This large-scale profit-taking has spooked investors, raising concerns of further downward momentum. Ethereum now stands at a crucial juncture, with upcoming price movements likely determining whether it follows Bitcoin’s 2021 rally or continues its slump. RCO Finance (RCOF): The Rising DeFi Star Amid Ethereum’s Market Shake-Up As the Ethereum price grapples with a turbulent market, RCO Finance (RCOF) is rapidly gaining traction as the next big disruptor in decentralized finance. While Ethereum faces the risk of liquidation-driven volatility, RCO Finance draws investor attention with its cutting-edge AI-driven technology and innovative financial solutions. Unlike traditional altcoins focused on blockchain efficiency, RCO Finance integrates artificial intelligence to revolutionize portfolio management and asset diversification, setting a new standard in the DeFi sector. At the core of RCO Finance’s ecosystem is its AI Robo Advisor, an autonomous tool designed to navigate the complexities of the crypto market. This intelligent system continuously analyzes real-time market trends, historical data, and breaking financial news, ensuring investors maximize opportunities while minimizing risk. Unlike human traders prone to emotional decisions, the Robo Advisor operates 24/7, swiftly identifying high-potential assets, such as the recent surge in Vana (VANA) , which skyrocketed by 80% in just 24 hours. Moreover, it employs advanced hedging techniques to protect portfolios from sudden market downturns, leveraging insights from financial institutions and sources like Reuters to make data-driven recommendations. RCO Finance also redefines digital asset utility by enabling seamless investments in crypto and traditional financial markets. Users can diversify their holdings across stocks, bonds, and real estate without fiat conversions through its innovative framework. This breakthrough eliminates the usual barriers between blockchain-based and traditional finance, allowing investors to easily build multi-asset portfolios. Additionally, RCO Finance ensures full financial autonomy with low transaction fees and a completely KYC-free onboarding process, providing a seamless and private investment experience. Security remains a top priority, and SolidProof audits and verifies all smart contracts, offering users confidence in the platform’s reliability. Investor interest in RCO Finance is surging, particularly following the beta launch of its platform, which has already attracted over 10,000 active users. This growing adoption is fueled by the platform’s seamless automation, allowing even novice investors to execute complex trading strategies effortlessly. With the upcoming alpha launch, additional features, such as real-time portfolio monitoring and enhanced AI analytics, are set to further elevate RCO Finance’s appeal. RCO Finance (RCOF) Presale: A Prime Opportunity for Early Investors With Ethereum’s volatility prompting traders to seek alternative investment opportunities, RCO Finance is emerging as a high-potential asset. Currently in Presale Stage 5, RCOF tokens are available at $0.10, with the price set to increase to $0.13 in the next stage. Market analysts predict a listing price of $0.60, positioning early investors for potential 600% returns.

Beyond price appreciation, RCO Finance presents multiple avenues for wealth-building, including staking and yield farming, with APYs as high as 86%. Investors also gain exclusive benefits such as AI-powered trading analytics, fee discounts, priority customer support, and governance rights, allowing them to shape the platform’s future. As the Ethereum price fluctuations introduce uncertainty, RCO Finance is a promising alternative for traders seeking stability and exponential growth. With its AI-powered financial tools, multi-asset investment capabilities, and rapidly expanding community, RCO Finance is not just another altcoin; it is a transformative force in DeFi. Now is the time to seize this opportunity and become part of the next evolution in decentralized finance.

Internet Computer (ICP) works to replace traditional cloud systems with a decentralized network, while The Graph (GRT) simplifies data access through efficient blockchain indexing for decentralized apps. Yet, both face challenges related to market volatility and adoption hurdles. Web3Bay sets itself apart by blending AI smart contracts with blockchain technology, boosting e-commerce security, preventing fraud, and streamlining transactions. Using AI-powered contracts, Web3Bay connects blockchain capabilities with practical uses in online shopping. Web3Bay Uses AI to Secure and Personalize E-Commerce Web3Bay’s AI-driven smart contracts enhance security, tailor shopping experiences, and combat fraud in decentralized online markets. Common issues like fake products, chargeback scams, and slow dispute resolution are tackled by automating processes that keep transactions transparent and safe while offering personalized recommendations based on user activity. By analyzing transaction patterns, Web3Bay’s AI detects and blocks fraud attempts before they happen, protecting sellers and building buyer confidence. Escrow payments are automated using smart contracts that release funds only when terms are met, preventing false claims and disputes. Beyond safety, Web3Bay improves product discovery with AI that delivers personalized deals, unlike traditional platforms that use generic algorithms. This approach boosts user satisfaction while helping sellers increase their sales. With $1.5 million raised during its presale and over 380 million tokens sold in Stage 4 at $0.00456 per 3BAY, Web3Bay’s AI-driven model is set to reshape online shopping. Internet Computer (ICP): Decentralized Cloud and Network Growth Launched on May 10, 2021, by the DFINITY Foundation, Internet Computer (ICP) extends the Internet’s capabilities as a global computing platform. Unlike standard cloud services, it relies on independent data centers worldwide, allowing smart contracts to deliver interactive web content directly to users and removing the need for servers and centralized infrastructure. ICP has grown significantly, with the network processing over three billion blocks by March 2024, surpassing the block count of many other blockchains. This reflects its scalability and growing use in decentralized services. Financially, ICP has seen volatility. After launching at $461.65, its price as of February 19, 2025, stands at $6.88—a drop of about 98.5%. Despite this, ICP’s market capitalization remains strong at around $3.26 billion, showing that the platform continues to attract interest despite price swings. The Graph (GRT): Indexing Blockchain Data for Decentralized Apps Introduced in December 2020, The Graph (GRT) is an open-source protocol that indexes blockchain data, enabling developers to access and retrieve information from various networks. Using subgraphs—open APIs—it organizes and extracts data, supporting decentralized applications. The Graph’s query demand has grown substantially. In Q1 2024, the network processed over 1.6 billion queries, up 66% from the previous quarter. By Q2 2024, this number reached 2.9 billion queries—an 81.25% increase—highlighting its expanding role in the decentralized data ecosystem. From a financial standpoint, GRT has experienced price fluctuations. Initially priced at $0.03, it climbed to an all-time high of $2.84 before declining. As of February 19, 2025, GRT is valued at approximately $0.133935, reflecting a drop from its peak. Still, its market capitalization remains solid at about $1.22 billion, signaling ongoing confidence in its long-term potential. Final Remarks! Blockchain’s growth continues with projects like Internet Computer (ICP) and The Graph (GRT) transforming industries through decentralized computing and data indexing. ICP’s cloud alternatives and GRT’s data retrieval solutions help drive blockchain adoption, though scalability and market volatility remain challenges. Web3Bay stands out by applying blockchain to daily transactions with AI smart contracts that secure payments, prevent fraud, and personalize e-commerce. With a focus on practical benefits, Web3Bay bridges the gap between blockchain and everyday online shopping , signaling its role in driving mainstream blockchain adoption.

It has gained a loyal fanbase, the attention of Elon Musk, and a market cap of $34.2 billion , making it a major coin in the Crypto industry. Sadly, the Dogecoin price has dipped to 5.36% in the last 24 hours and over 30% in the past month . Still, crypto analysts advise investors to buy despite the drop due to its potential integration as a payment method on X and its affiliation with the Department of Government Efficiency. This could see the Dogecoin price to rise by 20-40% , leading to bullish sentiment that can grow interest and investment in the Altcoin market. This optimistic view of the Dogecoin price has investors seeking additional altcoins to profit from in the crypto industry. This altcoin, RCOF, is an easy pick with its access to intelligent tools that optimize trades and a KYC-free ecosystem that ensures user privacy.

He views altcoins as an efficient and transparent method for managing government transactions, so he established the Department of Government Efficiency with Elon Musk at the helm. Dogecoin (DOGE) holders have gained substantially from November 2024 to January 2025, with the Dogecoin price rallying over 450% in this period. Unfortunately, the Dogecoin price has started to fall recently, with investors seeing this as an opportunity to buy low and gain massively from other Altcoins like RCOF.

Investors are rotating funds to more rewarding crypto opportunities, such as the PropiChain token presale, which has provided a stable return despite recent market volatility. Analysts suggest PropiChain can undergo a massive 35,000% rally after its listing and provide better returns than Dogecoin in the 2025 crypto bull run. Will Dogecoin Reverse Or Fall To Further Support? The Dogecoin price has performed underwhelmingly due to a decline in demand after its November rally. It has undergone a significant correction over the past few weeks after a rejection from the $0.42 resistance. Due to this rejection, Dogecoin plunged over 40% and consolidated at the $0.23 support for over two weeks. On Monday, DOGE witnessed massive selling pressure and dropped below this support level. In the last 24 hours, the daily trading volume has increased by 144%, and Dogecoin has declined 12.68%, currently trading at $0.2013. Due to the massive plunge, DOGE is now oversold with an RSI of 25.71. Dogecoin moved below its long-term 250-day SMA and is taking support at $0.196. If bulls enter and maintain the price above this support, it may reverse. PropiChain (PCHAIN): Invest In Tokenized Real Estate PropiChain is revolutionizing the real estate industry with its advanced RWA platform. It uses blockchain, AI, and the Metaverse to address the issues that have long plagued real estate investors, such as opaque pricing, high transaction costs, fraud risks, and lack of transparency. PropiChain uses tokens to represent small fractions of properties so users can trade real estate on the blockchain. This fractional ownership model enhances liquidity and diversification opportunities, giving users an advantage over conventional investors. The platform has also integrated advanced AI tools to simplify various investment processes. It has 24/7 active AI chatbots and virtual assistants that resolve users’ investment-related queries and provide assistance with complex paperwork and legal documents. The AI provides market insights by analyzing historical real estate sales data, such as future price fluctuations and demand changes. These insights help users develop data-driven investment strategies that can capture maximum returns. Users can also automate these strategies using AI by setting a condition like a specific valuation for a buy or sell order on a particular piece of real estate. The AI tracks the valuation and executes the order precisely to maximize potential returns. Furthermore, PropiChain users can use the Metaverse to get immersive 3D renderings for all listed real estate. Investors can thus take virtual tours of distant properties and assess their dream real estate to finalize investments from the comfort of their homes. Moreover, real estate owners can use the platform’s smart contracts to create lease agreements without manual paperwork or assistance from lawyers. The smart contracts automatically trigger the deal after the tenant transfers funds and both parties sign the document. Tenants can also automate their monthly rental payments using PropiChain’s smart contracts, and the landlord can set fixed penalties for late deposits. All the documents are stored on the blockchain, making the lease agreement publicly accessible and tamper-proof. PCHAIN: How The Emerging Crypto Can Outshine Dogecoin PCHAIN , the native token of the PropiChain ecosystem, is in the crypto presale phase. In stage two of the presale, it is available at an undervalued price of $0.011. The token’s value will soon surge to $0.023 when it reaches the third stage and to $0.032 after the presale. Thus, early investors who acquire the token before its next surge can turn $1,000 into over $2,000 by the next stage and over $2,900 by the end of the crypto presale. Moreover, crypto analysts suggest that PCHAIN’s practical use cases position it to undergo better growth than Dogecoin. They have predicted a massive 35,000% surge by the end of 2025, providing a $351,000 return on a $1,000 investment to early participants. Conclusion Due to disheartening performance, many Dogecoin holders are moving funds to the PropiChain token presale to make steady returns. Analysts also prefer PropiChain, as it has shown better returns in the past few weeks and has the potential for explosive growth after its launch. Regarding user safety, the leading blockchain security firm, BlockAudit , conducted rigorous security testing of the PropiChain platform, inspecting core infrastructure, smart contracts, security measures, and regulatory compliance. The final audit report highlights zero security vulnerabilities, reliable infrastructure, and complete compliance with regulations, guaranteeing PropiChain’s integrity and the security of the user’s funds. Furthermore, PCHAIN has been listed on CoinMarketCap . The listing has provided a broad audience for the project, significantly boosting its crypto presale performance. Token holders can expect quicker returns as the project reaches further milestones and presale gains more momentum. Analysts suggest PCHAIN can provide tremendous returns and outperform the Dogecoin price in the next bull cycle, forecasting a massive 35,000% rally this year. Thus, early presale participants can turn $1,000 in PCHAIN at this stage into $351,000 by the end of the year.

OpenAI just dropped a bombshell in the AI world with its latest model, GPT-4.5, codenamed ‘Orion.’ This isn’t just another incremental update; it’s a leap in AI persuasion , showcasing an uncanny ability to influence even other AI models. Imagine an AI that’s not just intelligent, but also remarkably convincing – that’s GPT-4.5. Let’s dive into why this news is sending ripples across the tech and crypto communities. Why is GPT-4.5’s Persuasion Prowess a Game Changer? OpenAI’s recent white paper reveals fascinating insights into GPT-4.5 ‘s capabilities, particularly in ‘persuasion.’ But what does this mean in practical terms? Essentially, OpenAI rigorously tested how well GPT-4.5 could influence beliefs and actions using model-generated content. The results are eye-opening, especially for those watching the intersection of AI and digital economies. One standout benchmark involved GPT-4.5 attempting to persuade another AI model , GPT-4o, to ‘donate’ virtual money. The outcome? GPT-4.5 outperformed all other OpenAI models, including those specifically designed for reasoning. It even surpassed the o3-mini model by a significant 10 percentage points in deceiving GPT-4o into revealing a secret codeword. This isn’t just about clever algorithms; it’s about a new level of sophistication in AI interaction. Here’s a breakdown of GPT-4.5’s performance in OpenAI’s persuasion benchmarks: Benchmark GPT-4.5 Performance Key Observation Virtual Money Donation Superior to all other OpenAI models GPT-4.5 employed a ‘modest request’ strategy, asking for smaller amounts to increase success rate. Codeword Deception 10 percentage points better than o3-mini Demonstrates enhanced ability to manipulate and extract information from other AI models. This data, straight from OpenAI’s evaluations, underscores a critical point: AI models are evolving beyond mere data processing; they’re learning the art of influence. While the amounts ‘donated’ were virtual, the implications for real-world applications, especially in areas like decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and smart contracts, are substantial. Navigating the Ethical Tightrope: AI Safety and Persuasion The rise of highly persuasive AI models like GPT-4.5 isn’t without its concerns, particularly around AI safety . OpenAI acknowledges these risks, especially concerning the potential for spreading misinformation and manipulating opinions. The company has stated that GPT-4.5, despite its persuasive abilities, doesn’t yet cross their internal ‘high-risk’ threshold for this benchmark. However, they’ve also committed to rigorous safety interventions before releasing any model that does reach that level. This is a crucial stance, considering the growing anxieties around AI-driven deepfakes and social engineering attacks. The ability of an AI to convincingly persuade could be a double-edged sword. While it opens doors for innovative applications, it also raises questions about misuse. OpenAI’s proactive approach to AI safety , including revising methods to assess real-world persuasion risks, is a welcome step in responsible AI development. What Does This Mean for the Future of AI and Crypto? For the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, GPT-4.5’s persuasion capabilities could unlock exciting new possibilities: Enhanced Smart Contracts: Imagine smart contracts that can dynamically adapt and negotiate terms based on persuasive AI agents. DAOs with Nuance: DAOs could become more sophisticated in decision-making, leveraging AI for nuanced negotiations and consensus-building. Advanced Trading Bots: AI-powered trading bots could evolve to not just analyze data, but also persuasively interact with market participants (other AI agents or even human traders in a controlled context – ethically of course!). However, it’s vital to approach these advancements with caution. As AI persuasion becomes more refined, the need for robust ethical frameworks and regulatory discussions in the crypto and AI sectors becomes paramount. We need to ensure that this powerful technology is used responsibly and for the benefit of the ecosystem.

OpenAI, the powerhouse behind ChatGPT, has just dropped a bombshell: they’re facing a critical GPU shortage . CEO Sam Altman himself confirmed that the rollout of their highly anticipated GPT-4.5 model is being throttled because, quite simply, they’ve run out of GPUs. For crypto enthusiasts and tech followers who understand the value of computational power, this news is a stark reminder of the infrastructure challenges underpinning the AI revolution. OpenAI Confirms GPU Shortage Hindering GPT-4.5 Launch In a candid post on X, Altman stated the obvious – OpenAI’s rapid growth and the sheer scale of GPT-4.5 have led to an unprecedented demand for Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). These powerful processors are the lifeblood of modern AI, enabling the complex computations needed to run large language models. According to Altman, GPT-4.5, described as “giant” and “expensive,” needs “tens of thousands” more GPUs before it can be widely accessible to ChatGPT users. This GPU shortage isn’t just a minor inconvenience; it’s a significant bottleneck impacting the accessibility of cutting-edge AI. GPT-4.5: First Access for ChatGPT Pro, Then Plus – But When for Everyone Else? The rollout plan is now staggered. ChatGPT Pro subscribers will get first dibs on GPT-4.5 starting this Thursday, followed by ChatGPT Plus customers next week. This phased approach highlights the severity of the GPU shortage . It’s not just about delaying features; it’s about managing limited resources to ensure some level of access while they scramble to acquire more processing power. For users eager to experience the latest AI advancements, this wait might feel like an eternity in the fast-paced tech world. Unhinged Pricing: The Staggering Cost of GPT-4.5 Beyond the GPU shortage , another aspect of GPT-4.5 is raising eyebrows – its pricing. Prepare for sticker shock: OpenAI is charging a whopping $75 per million tokens (roughly 750,000 words) fed into the model and $150 per million tokens generated by it. Let’s break down this AI model pricing : Input Cost: $75 per million tokens Output Cost: $150 per million tokens Comparison to GPT-4o: 30x the input cost and 15x the output cost This pricing structure is significantly higher than OpenAI’s current workhorse model, GPT-4o. The 30x increase in input cost and 15x increase in output cost compared to GPT-4o is, as some users online have described, “unhinged.” This pricing model suggests GPT-4.5 is not just an incremental upgrade; it’s a fundamentally more resource-intensive and premium offering. The tweet from Casper Hansen perfectly captures the sentiment: “GPT 4.5 pricing is unhinged. If this doesn’t have enormous models smell, I will be disappointed.” Addressing the Root Cause: OpenAI’s Plan to Tackle GPU Dependency Altman acknowledged that these GPU shortages are not ideal. “We’ve been growing a lot and are out of GPUs,” he admitted. He also mentioned plans to add “tens of thousands of GPUs next week” to expand access to the Plus tier. However, he emphasized the difficulty in predicting and perfectly managing growth surges that lead to these shortages. This isn’t a new problem for OpenAI. Altman has previously stated that limited computing capacity is a recurring obstacle in their product development pipeline. To combat this long-term, OpenAI is taking a multi-pronged approach to lessen their reliance on external GPU suppliers and secure their computing future. Their strategy includes: Developing Proprietary AI Chips: Moving towards in-house chip design to optimize performance and potentially reduce costs and dependency on market fluctuations. This AI chip development is a significant undertaking, but could provide a competitive edge and greater control over their infrastructure. Building Massive Datacenters: Investing in extensive datacenter infrastructure to house and operate the massive computational resources needed for their AI models. This is a capital-intensive but necessary step to support the growing demand for AI. What Does This Mean for the Future of AI and Crypto? The OpenAI GPU shortage is more than just a temporary setback; it’s a symptom of the intense computational demands of advanced AI and the limitations of current infrastructure. For the cryptocurrency world, which is increasingly intertwined with AI through applications like algorithmic trading, blockchain analytics, and decentralized AI platforms, this news is highly relevant. Here’s why this GPU crunch matters to the crypto and broader tech space: AI Development Bottleneck: GPU scarcity can slow down the pace of AI innovation across industries. If even giants like OpenAI are struggling, smaller startups and research labs could face even greater hurdles. Increased Costs: High demand for GPUs can drive up prices, making AI development more expensive. This could impact the accessibility and affordability of AI-powered tools and services.

Decoding the NVT Golden Cross Signal According to a recent report by CryptoQuant analyst tugbachain, the NVT Golden Cross indicator has flashed a significant signal. This indicator, which is closely watched by market experts, has plunged below -2.4. Why is this important? This level typically indicates that Bitcoin has entered an oversold territory. But what exactly does “oversold” mean in the context of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets? Oversold Explained: When an asset is oversold, it suggests that the price has fallen too quickly and too far, often driven by excessive selling pressure. This situation is often considered unsustainable in the long run. The NVT Golden Cross Indicator: The NVT (Network Value to Transactions) Golden Cross is a momentum indicator that compares the network value of Bitcoin to the daily transaction volume on the blockchain. A low NVT Golden Cross can suggest undervaluation or oversold conditions. Below -2.4 Threshold: Historically, when the NVT Golden Cross dips below -2.4, it has often preceded periods of price stabilization or even upward price correction for Bitcoin. In simpler terms, the NVT Golden Cross indicator is suggesting that the recent Bitcoin price drop might be an overreaction, and the market could be poised for a reversal. Potential Bitcoin Rebound: What Could Trigger the Turnaround? While the Bitcoin oversold signal is promising, it’s crucial to understand that it’s not a guarantee of an immediate price surge. However, it does increase the probability of a Bitcoin rebound . So, what factors could contribute to a potential upward movement? Market Sentiment Shift: Oversold conditions can sometimes lead to a shift in market sentiment. Traders and investors might start to view Bitcoin as undervalued, leading to renewed buying interest. Technical Correction: After a sharp decline, markets often experience a technical correction. This is a natural price recovery as the market adjusts from the excessive selling pressure. Whale Activity: Large Bitcoin holders, often referred to as “whales,” might see oversold conditions as an opportune moment to accumulate more Bitcoin, further driving up demand and potentially triggering a rebound. Positive News Catalysts: Unexpected positive news, such as favorable regulatory developments or increased institutional adoption, could act as a catalyst to propel Bitcoin out of the oversold zone. It’s important to remember that the crypto market is influenced by a multitude of factors, and predicting the exact timing and magnitude of a rebound is challenging. However, the oversold signal combined with these potential catalysts does paint a cautiously optimistic picture. Analyzing Bitcoin Price Analysis: Key Resistance Levels to Watch If a Bitcoin rebound does materialize, where could the price potentially go? The CryptoQuant analyst points to a significant resistance level: the 111-day moving average (DMA), currently around $96,895. Let’s break down why this level is important in Bitcoin price analysis : Technical Indicator Description Significance 111-day Moving Average (DMA) The average closing price of Bitcoin over the past 111 days. Moving averages are used to smooth out price fluctuations and identify trends. The 111-DMA can act as a dynamic resistance level. Resistance Level A price level where selling pressure is expected to outweigh buying pressure, potentially halting or reversing an upward price movement. If Bitcoin rebounds, the 111-DMA at $96,895 could present a significant hurdle. Breaking above this level would signal further bullish momentum. Traders and investors should closely monitor Bitcoin’s price action around this $96,895 level if a rebound begins. A successful break above this resistance could open the door for further gains, while failure to overcome it might indicate continued consolidation or even another price correction.

Consider DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging): If you believe in the long-term potential of Bitcoin and have a long-term investment horizon, oversold conditions can be opportune moments to consider dollar-cost averaging into Bitcoin. Watch for Confirmation: Don’t rely solely on one indicator. Look for confirmation of a rebound through other technical indicators, price action, and market sentiment shifts. The current market situation presents both risks and opportunities. By staying informed, understanding the signals like the NVT Golden Cross, and managing your risk, you can navigate this potentially pivotal moment in the Bitcoin market. Conclusion: Is the Bitcoin Bottom In? A Cautious Optimism The analysis from CryptoQuant analyst tugbachain, highlighting the Bitcoin oversold signal based on the NVT Golden Cross, offers a glimmer of hope for those watching the recent price declines. While it’s not a guarantee of an immediate price surge, it does suggest that a Bitcoin rebound is increasingly probable. The 111-DMA at $96,895 stands as a key resistance level to watch if the rebound materializes, and Bitcoin price analysis suggests this level will be crucial. By understanding these signals and remaining vigilant, you can position yourself to potentially capitalize on the next phase of Bitcoin’s market cycle. Remember to always conduct your own research and consider your risk tolerance before making any investment decisions in the volatile cryptocurrency market.

The usually smooth waters of testnet deployments have just encountered a significant ripple. Ethereum core developer Tim Beiko has sounded the alarm on X, announcing an urgent situation with the Pectra upgrade on the Holesky testnet. What started as a routine activation on Monday has quickly turned into a race against time to stabilize the network. Let’s dive into what’s happening and what it means for you, especially if you’re a validator on Holesky or Sepolia. What’s the Buzz About the Ethereum Pectra Upgrade and Holesky Testnet? For those unfamiliar, the Ethereum Pectra upgrade is the next major step in Ethereum’s ongoing evolution. Think of it as the latest software update for the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. These upgrades are crucial for enhancing Ethereum’s capabilities, improving performance, and paving the way for future innovations. Before these upgrades hit the main Ethereum network, they are rigorously tested on testnets like Holesky. Holesky testnet , launched as a successor to Goerli, is designed to simulate the Ethereum mainnet environment, allowing developers to test new features and upgrades in a live setting without risking real funds. It’s a critical sandbox for ensuring the robustness and stability of Ethereum’s future developments. Think of it as a dress rehearsal before the main show. The Chain Split Bug: A Speed Bump in the Pectra Upgrade Journey The current hiccup involves a “chain-splitting EL bug” that emerged immediately after the Pectra upgrade activated on Holesky this Monday. In simple terms, a chain split means the blockchain is no longer in agreement about its history. Imagine two groups of people reading different versions of the same book – that’s essentially what a chain split is in the blockchain world. This disagreement can lead to network instability and unpredictable behavior, which is the last thing you want on a testnet designed for stability testing! Why is a chain split bug a problem? Network Instability: A chain split disrupts the smooth operation of the testnet, making it unreliable for developers to test their applications. Data Inconsistency: Different parts of the network might have different views of the blockchain’s state, leading to confusion and errors. Hindered Testing: The primary purpose of Holesky, to test upgrades, is compromised if the testnet itself is unstable. This isn’t necessarily a doomsday scenario, but it’s definitely a red flag that requires immediate attention from the Ethereum core developers. It highlights the inherent complexities in upgrading a decentralized network and the importance of thorough testing. Urgent Call to Action: Holesky Validators Must Update Now! Tim Beiko’s announcement wasn’t just an FYI; it was an urgent call to action, particularly for validators on the Holesky testnet. Validators are the backbone of any proof-of-stake blockchain like Ethereum. They are responsible for verifying transactions and maintaining the network’s integrity. If validators don’t act quickly, the consequences could be significant. The Key Action: Node Update The fix for this chain split bug comes in the form of a software update for Ethereum Execution Layer (EL) clients. Validators are being instructed to update their nodes – the software they run to participate in the Ethereum network – to the latest version that incorporates the fix. This update is crucial to bring the network back into consensus and resolve the chain split. Why is this update so critical? Because failure to update nodes by a specific deadline leads to a rather unpleasant outcome: a mass slashing event. Mass Slashing Event: The Clock is Ticking! Now, let’s talk about the elephant in the room – the dreaded “mass slashing event.” Slashing is a mechanism in proof-of-stake systems designed to penalize validators for misbehavior or, in this case, for running outdated software that contributes to network instability. In essence, validators who don’t update their nodes in time will face a penalty, losing a portion of their staked ETH. The Deadline: February 28th, 15:00 UTC Mark your calendars and set your alarms, Holesky validators! The deadline for updating nodes is February 28th at 15:00 UTC. This isn’t just a suggestion; it’s a hard deadline. Validators who haven’t updated by this time risk being slashed. The urgency is palpable, and the Ethereum development community is working hard to ensure everyone is aware and takes the necessary steps. What does mass slashing mean? Financial Penalty: Validators who are slashed will lose a portion of their staked ETH. The exact amount can vary, but it’s a significant financial disincentive. Reputational Damage: Being slashed can also damage a validator’s reputation within the Ethereum community. Network Health: While slashing is a necessary mechanism, a mass slashing event, even on a testnet, can disrupt network operations and validator participation temporarily. Sepolia Users: Are You Affected Too? The announcement also mentions that some Sepolia users are required to upgrade. Sepolia is another important Ethereum testnet, often used for testing smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). While the primary focus of the urgent update is on Holesky due to the Pectra upgrade activation, it seems the underlying bug might have implications for Sepolia as well, at least for certain users. Who on Sepolia needs to upgrade? The specifics for Sepolia users are less detailed in the initial announcement, but the mention suggests that if you are running a node on Sepolia, especially if you are involved in testing related to recent Ethereum updates or using specific client software, it’s prudent to check for updates and follow any instructions from client developers or the Ethereum Foundation. It’s always better to be safe than sorry, especially when dealing with network-level issues. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community This situation, while concerning, provides valuable insights for the broader cryptocurrency community: Importance of Testnets: This incident underscores the critical role of testnets like Holesky and Sepolia in the development process. They are designed to catch bugs and issues before they impact the mainnet, saving potentially millions (or billions) of dollars and preventing major disruptions. Agility and Responsiveness: The Ethereum core developers’ rapid response and communication highlight the agility of the Ethereum development community. Identifying the bug, developing a fix, and communicating it to validators within a short timeframe demonstrates a robust and responsive system. Validator Responsibility: This event emphasizes the responsibility that comes with being a validator in a proof-of-stake network. Validators are not passive participants; they play an active role in maintaining network health and must be vigilant in applying updates and following protocol guidelines. Transparency and Communication: Tim Beiko’s public announcement on X is a testament to the transparency within the Ethereum ecosystem. Open communication about issues, even critical ones, builds trust and allows the community to respond effectively. Navigating the Ethereum Pectra Upgrade Bug: A Summary The Ethereum Pectra upgrade on the Holesky testnet has hit a snag with a chain-splitting EL bug. This requires immediate action from Holesky validators to update their nodes before the February 28th deadline to avoid a mass slashing event. Some Sepolia users might also need to update. While this is a setback, it’s also a testament to the rigorous testing and proactive nature of Ethereum’s development process. Testnets are doing their job by catching these issues before they reach the mainnet, and the community is mobilizing to address the situation swiftly. This episode serves as a powerful reminder of the complexities of blockchain technology and the constant vigilance required to maintain and upgrade these intricate systems. Stay tuned for further updates as the Ethereum developers work to resolve this issue and get the Pectra upgrade back on track for a smooth and successful deployment.

40939371,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=135164,1740712793,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Triumph for Coinbase: SEC Lawsuit Dismissed with Prejudice – A Relief for Crypto?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/coinbase-sec-lawsuit-dismissed/,"In a surprising turn of events that sent ripples of excitement through the crypto community, leading cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have officially put an end to their legal battle. According to a recent announcement from Tree News on X, the lawsuit between Coinbase and the SEC has been dismissed “with prejudice.” But what does this mean for Coinbase, the broader crypto landscape, and what led to this unexpected resolution? Let’s dive into the details of this landmark lawsuit dismissal and explore its potential implications. What Does ‘Dismissed with Prejudice’ Mean for the Coinbase Lawsuit? For those unfamiliar with legal jargon, “dismissed with prejudice” is a significant term. It essentially means that the case is permanently closed and cannot be refiled in the same court. This is a crucial victory for Coinbase as it signals a definitive end to this particular legal challenge from the SEC. Unlike a dismissal “without prejudice,” which leaves the door open for the case to be brought again, this dismissal provides Coinbase with a sense of closure and legal certainty regarding this specific matter. Let’s break down why this is such a big deal: Finality: The most important aspect is the finality. Coinbase doesn’t have to worry about the SEC resurrecting this exact lawsuit in the future. This removes a significant cloud of uncertainty that has been hanging over the exchange. Positive Signal: A dismissal with prejudice can be interpreted as an acknowledgment, at least in this instance, that the SEC’s case might not have been as strong as initially perceived. It’s not an admission of wrongdoing by the SEC, but it certainly suggests a strategic retreat in this particular legal arena. Resource Relief: Legal battles are expensive and time-consuming. Dismissing the Coinbase lawsuit frees up Coinbase’s resources, both financial and personnel, allowing them to focus on growth, innovation, and navigating the evolving regulatory landscape more proactively. This dismissal comes as a welcome relief for Coinbase and its supporters, who have been closely watching the developments of this legal tussle. Understanding the Context: The SEC’s Crypto Regulation Stance To fully appreciate the significance of this SEC lawsuit dismissal, it’s important to understand the broader context of the SEC’s approach to crypto regulation . The SEC has been increasingly assertive in its oversight of the cryptocurrency industry, often taking an enforcement-first approach. They have argued that many cryptocurrencies and crypto-related services fall under their jurisdiction as securities, requiring them to comply with securities laws. Coinbase, as one of the largest and most prominent cryptocurrency exchanges globally, has often found itself in the crosshairs of regulatory scrutiny. The specifics of the dismissed lawsuit, while not detailed in the initial announcement, likely revolved around the SEC’s interpretation of Coinbase’s operations and whether certain aspects of their services constituted securities offerings or violations of securities laws. Here’s a simplified look at the SEC’s general concerns regarding crypto: SEC Concern Why it Matters Unregistered Securities The SEC believes many tokens are securities and must be registered, protecting investors through disclosure and oversight. Investor Protection Ensuring fair markets and preventing fraud and manipulation in the crypto space is a key SEC priority. Market Integrity Maintaining orderly and efficient markets, which the SEC believes is compromised by unregulated crypto activities. Coinbase has consistently maintained that it operates within the bounds of the law and has advocated for clearer regulatory guidelines for the crypto industry. This Coinbase SEC situation highlights the ongoing tension between innovation in the crypto space and the traditional regulatory frameworks. Benefits and Broader Implications of the Lawsuit Dismissal The dismissal of the Coinbase SEC lawsuit isn’t just a win for Coinbase; it has broader implications for the entire cryptocurrency industry. Let’s explore some of the key benefits and potential ripple effects: Boost to Coinbase’s Stock and Reputation: The news of the dismissal is likely to be viewed positively by investors, potentially boosting Coinbase’s stock price and strengthening its reputation as a resilient and legally sound platform. Positive Sentiment for Crypto Market: This development could inject positive sentiment into the broader crypto market. It may be interpreted as a sign that regulatory pressures might be easing, or at least that legal battles against major crypto players are not always straightforward for regulators. Potential for Constructive Dialogue: Perhaps this dismissal could pave the way for a more constructive dialogue between the SEC and the crypto industry. Instead of solely relying on enforcement actions, there might be a greater incentive for both sides to engage in developing clearer and more practical regulatory frameworks. Encouragement for Innovation: Reduced legal uncertainty can encourage further innovation and investment in the crypto space. Businesses might feel more confident in developing new products and services knowing that the immediate threat of this particular type of legal action has subsided. However, it’s crucial to remain grounded and realistic. While this lawsuit dismissal is undoubtedly positive news, it doesn’t signify the end of regulatory scrutiny for Coinbase or the crypto industry as a whole. Challenges Ahead and the Future of Crypto Regulation Despite this victory, Coinbase and the crypto industry still face significant regulatory challenges. The SEC and other regulatory bodies globally are continuing to grapple with how to effectively oversee this rapidly evolving sector. Here are some ongoing challenges and considerations: Ongoing Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for crypto remains fragmented and often unclear. Different jurisdictions have varying approaches, and even within the U.S., there’s still a lack of comprehensive and consistent regulations. Potential for Future SEC Actions: While this specific lawsuit is dismissed, it doesn’t preclude the SEC from initiating other investigations or enforcement actions against Coinbase or other crypto companies in the future, potentially on different grounds. Need for Clearer Regulatory Frameworks: The crypto industry continues to advocate for clearer and more tailored regulatory frameworks that recognize the unique characteristics of blockchain technology and digital assets, rather than simply applying existing securities laws in a blanket manner. Global Regulatory Coordination: Given the global nature of cryptocurrencies, international regulatory coordination is essential to prevent regulatory arbitrage and ensure consistent standards across different countries. Coinbase and other industry leaders will need to continue engaging with regulators, advocating for sensible rules, and demonstrating their commitment to compliance and investor protection. The dismissal of this lawsuit is a battle won, but the broader regulatory war is far from over. Actionable Insights: What Can We Learn From This? This lawsuit dismissal provides several valuable insights for both crypto enthusiasts and those in the traditional financial world: Legal Battles are Not Always Decisive: Regulatory agencies don’t always win legal challenges. This case demonstrates that even powerful regulators like the SEC can face setbacks in court. Advocacy and Engagement Matter: Coinbase’s proactive engagement with regulators and its willingness to defend its position in court likely played a role in this outcome. The crypto industry needs to continue advocating for its interests and engaging in constructive dialogue with policymakers. Regulatory Clarity is Crucial: The ongoing regulatory uncertainty highlights the urgent need for clearer and more tailored rules for the crypto industry. This benefits both businesses and consumers by providing a more predictable and stable environment. Resilience of the Crypto Industry: Despite facing numerous regulatory hurdles and legal challenges, the crypto industry continues to demonstrate resilience and innovation. This dismissal can be seen as another example of its ability to navigate complex and often hostile regulatory environments. Conclusion: A Moment of Relief, But the Journey Continues The dismissal of the lawsuit between Coinbase and the SEC with prejudice marks a significant and undoubtedly positive development for Coinbase and the cryptocurrency industry. It’s a moment of relief, offering a respite from legal uncertainty and potentially paving the way for a more constructive regulatory dialogue. However, it’s crucial to remember that this is just one step in a long and evolving journey. The regulatory landscape for crypto remains complex and dynamic, and ongoing engagement, advocacy, and collaboration will be essential to ensure the responsible and sustainable growth of this transformative technology. This victory should be seen as an encouragement to continue building, innovating, and working towards a future where crypto can thrive within a clear and supportive regulatory framework.

40939791,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=135169,1740713342,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary Crypto Partnership: Aleo Foundation Joins Forces with Google Cloud for Zero-Knowledge Innovation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/aleo-foundation-google-cloud-partnership/,"Exciting news ripples through the crypto sphere! Aleo Foundation, the driving force behind the innovative layer-1 blockchain leveraging zero-knowledge proof technology, has just announced a groundbreaking strategic partnership with tech giant Google Cloud. This collaboration is poised to inject fresh momentum into the world of blockchain analytics and developer accessibility. Let’s dive into what this powerful alliance means for the future of blockchain and, more specifically, the Aleo ecosystem. Why is this Strategic Partnership a Game Changer? In a nutshell, this strategic partnership is a significant leap forward for both Aleo and the wider blockchain community. Google Cloud, a titan in cloud computing, will officially step in as a blockchain validator for the Aleo network. But the collaboration extends far beyond validation. Google Cloud plans to deeply integrate with and analyze Aleo’s blockchain data using its sophisticated BigQuery platform. What does this mean in practical terms? Enhanced Network Security and Reliability: Google Cloud’s participation as a validator strengthens Aleo’s network by adding a robust and reputable entity to the consensus mechanism. Unlocking Real-Time Blockchain Data Analysis: The integration with Google Cloud BigQuery is the real headline here. Aleo blockchain records will be meticulously indexed, paving the way for real-time analysis of transaction patterns and network activities. Empowering Developers with Actionable Insights: Imagine developers gaining instant access to comprehensive analytics about the Aleo network without the burden of running their own nodes. This partnership makes it a reality. Diving Deeper into Zero-Knowledge Proof Technology At the heart of Aleo’s innovation lies zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) technology. For those unfamiliar, ZKP is a revolutionary cryptographic method that allows one party (the prover) to prove to another party (the verifier) that a statement is true without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself. Think of it as proving you know the answer to a puzzle without revealing the answer itself. Why is zero-knowledge proof so important? In the context of blockchain, ZKP offers: Enhanced Privacy: Transactions can be verified without exposing sensitive details, crucial for applications requiring confidentiality. Scalability Improvements: ZKP can potentially reduce the computational burden on blockchains, leading to faster transaction processing.

Google Cloud’s Role: Validator and Data Analysis Powerhouse Google Cloud isn’t just dipping its toes into the Aleo ecosystem; it’s making a significant commitment. By becoming a blockchain validator, Google Cloud directly contributes to the security and operational integrity of the Aleo network. But the integration with BigQuery for blockchain data analysis is where the real magic happens. What is BigQuery and Why Does it Matter for Aleo? Google BigQuery is a powerful, serverless, and cost-effective multi-cloud data warehouse designed for big data analytics. Its capabilities are perfectly suited for the vast and complex datasets generated by blockchains. Here’s why BigQuery is a game-changer for blockchain data analysis within the Aleo ecosystem: Real-Time Insights: BigQuery enables near real-time analysis of Aleo’s blockchain data, providing up-to-the-minute information on transaction flows, network activity, and smart contract interactions. Scalable Data Exploration: BigQuery can handle massive datasets with ease, allowing developers and researchers to explore historical trends and identify emerging patterns within the Aleo network. Simplified Data Access: Developers no longer need to wrestle with the complexities of running and maintaining their own Aleo nodes to access network data. Google Cloud is essentially providing a streamlined and readily accessible data pipeline. Benefits for Developers: Unleashing Innovation on Aleo This strategic partnership is a boon for developers eager to build on the Aleo blockchain. The enhanced data accessibility and analytical capabilities translate directly into tangible benefits for the developer community: Faster Development Cycles: Real-time data insights empower developers to rapidly iterate and refine their applications based on actual network usage and user behavior. Data-Driven Decision Making: Developers can leverage BigQuery’s analytical tools to make informed decisions about application design, smart contract optimization, and user engagement strategies. New Application Possibilities: The ease of accessing and analyzing blockchain data opens doors to creating sophisticated decentralized applications (dApps) that were previously challenging to develop due to data access limitations. Think advanced DeFi tools, sophisticated on-chain analytics dashboards, and more. Looking Ahead: The Future of Aleo and Google Cloud’s Collaboration The Aleo Foundation and Google Cloud partnership marks a pivotal moment for the Aleo ecosystem and the broader adoption of zero-knowledge technology. By combining Aleo’s cutting-edge ZKP blockchain with Google Cloud’s robust infrastructure and data analytics expertise, this collaboration is setting the stage for a new era of privacy-preserving and data-driven blockchain innovation. The enhanced accessibility to real-time blockchain data will undoubtedly fuel developer creativity and accelerate the growth of the Aleo network. This is a space to watch closely as it unfolds, promising exciting developments in the near future.

In a technical analysis shared on X, Rose Premium Signals (@VipRoseTr) highlights a potentially bullish setup for Dogecoin (DOGE), fueled by a classic “Cup & Handle” pattern. Dogecoin Cup And Handle Could Emerge According to the chart, the DOGE price could face a last leg down before it will find its low near the $0.16896 support zone. This level marks the base of a possible Cup & Handle pattern—a formation characterized by a rounded “cup” followed by a smaller consolidation or “handle.” Technically, the cup phase reflects the market’s effort to find a bottom, while the handle phase often takes shape as a brief pullback or sideways movement before a potential breakout. The pivotal zone for DOGE’s next move appears to be near $0.29124. If price rallies above this threshold, it would likely confirm the Cup & Handle formation and could trigger a robust upward swing. The chart suggests that traders may interpret a decisive daily or weekly close above $0.29124 as a confirmation signal, potentially ushering in bullish momentum. Related Reading: Long-Term Dogecoin Holders Are In “Denial” – On-Chain Metrics Expose Weakness “DOGE is showing strong bullish potential as it approaches a key reversal zone. Price has reached the $0.16896 support, aligning with a potential Cup & Handle formation. A breakout above $0.29124 could confirm a rally toward new highs,” Rose Premium Signals writes via X. In terms of upside objectives, Rose Premium Signals indicates that DOGE could climb toward the $0.50 – $0.60 range if the Cup & Handle pattern plays out as anticipated. This target corresponds to historical zones of increased trading activity and psychological levels that often capture traders’ attention. The analysis further notes potential for further upside, hinting that Dogecoin’s trajectory may extend beyond $0.60 should positive sentiment intensify. “Long-term target sits near $0.50 – $0.60, with potential for further upside. If momentum continues, Dogecoin could reclaim its meme coin throne and push toward higher levels,” the analysts say. Related Reading: If Dogecoin Falls Below This Level, A Freefall To $0.06 Is Possible: Analyst This commentary underscores DOGE’s capacity to reclaim its status among top meme coins. While the recent memecoin mania has flooded the market with thousands of smaller tokens, diverting attention from the original memecoin, Dogecoin, the landscape may be shifting. Following the burst of the memecoin bubble— which peaked with TRUMP, MELANIA, and LIBRA— focus could soon return to DOGE as traders seek more established assets in the space. From a technical perspective, a decisive breakout with sustained momentum could reignite both retail and institutional interest, propelling DOGE toward higher resistance levels and confirming the potential Cup & Handle pattern.

The cryptocurrency hit a high of $2.97 during a massive rally, despite the broader market downturn that saw Bitcoin dip below $85k. As Pi Coin recovers from an initial sell-off, predictions and targets are flying high, with some speculating that the price could hit $3 or even $4 in the future. What’s Driving Pi’s Price? Despite recent losses, analysts and investors are eyeing potential events that could push the price of Pi Coin higher in the near future. Analyst Kim Wong took to social media and revealed details, listing key events that could lead to Pi’s price surge: Major Exchange Listings: A Pi Coin listing on major exchanges could be right around the corner. If confirmed, it may trigger a big price increase. Past exchange listings, like OKX’s listing, have seen Pi jump by over 36% in just an hour. “If a major exchange greenlight listing, history suggests a 50-100% price pop isn’t out of the question,” he wrote. Increasing Popularity: As Pi Coin gains more attention, new supporters and investors may flock to the Pi Network, boosting demand for Pi Coin. Partnerships with Merchants and Payment Platforms: If major online shopping companies and merchants announce partnerships with Pi Network, it could provide further legitimacy and value to Pi Coin, making it more attractive to buyers. Expansion of the Pi Ecosystem: More decentralized applications (Dapps) in Pi’s ecosystem could increase its utility and spark investor interest. Influential Endorsements: Endorsements from well-known crypto media outlets and experts could significantly increase Pi’s visibility and attract more investors.

Helium introduced a decentralized wireless network where users earn HNT for IoT coverage, while Arweave enables permanent blockchain data storage. As more blockchain services gain attention, Web3Bay is emerging as a key player in decentralized e-commerce. With $1.55 million raised during its presale and over 375 million tokens sold, Web3Bay is attracting widespread interest. Compared to Helium and Arweave, which focus on specific needs, Web3Bay’s platform aims to compete with giants like Amazon and eBay by offering lower fees and more user control. Why Crypto Analysts Show Confidence in Web3Bay’s Growth Potential Web3Bay’s presale has gained traction, raising $1.55 million as popular crypto figures on Twitter and YouTube highlight its potential. With over 375 million tokens sold, the project has drawn the attention of early adopters who see its promise in reshaping online retail. Currently, in Stage 4, the 3BAY token is priced at $0.00456 before the next price increase. Influencer marketing has significantly contributed to boosting Web3Bay’s visibility and traction. Prominent crypto analysts and traders have been pivotal in promoting its decentralized marketplace as an effective alternative to traditional platforms like Amazon and eBay, which are known for their high fees and centralized control. Moreover, reviews on YouTube and active discussions on Twitter have spurred organic engagement, enhancing investor confidence in the project’s innovative vision. Social proof is significantly driving Web3Bay’s expansion. Crypto influencers engaging with the presale and sharing their positive experiences have captured the attention of retail investors. Additionally, endorsements from well-known figures could increase its reach beyond crypto circles. Together, these factors, along with growing demand, position Web3Bay as a blockchain commerce platform with strong community support. Helium: The Crypto-Powered Decentralized Wireless Network Helium was founded in 2013 by Amir Haleem, Shawn Fanning, and Sean Carey, aiming to create a decentralized wireless network. In 2019, it launched Helium Hotspots, allowing users to earn HNT for providing IoT coverage. By 2021, the network had expanded to over 500,000 hotspots in 169 countries. In April 2023, Helium moved to the Solana blockchain to improve efficiency. This transition helped launch Helium Mobile in December 2023, a decentralized mobile network now generating about 90% of the project’s revenue. Despite market ups and downs, Helium remains active in Web3. As of February 2025, HNT trades at $3.46, reflecting steady usage and adoption. Its decentralized model continues to attract individuals and businesses seeking wireless infrastructure outside traditional systems. Arweave: Enabling Permanent Blockchain Storage Arweave began in June 2018, offering permanent data storage on the blockchain. In 2019, it raised $5 million from backers like Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures. Its growth accelerated in 2021 as demand for permanent storage increased with the rise of NFTs. By early 2025, daily data uploads averaged more than 400 GB. Despite price fluctuations, Arweave remains a leading choice for long-term blockchain storage. For example, the AR token rose above $40 in August 2024 before stabilizing at $9.05 in February 2025. Arweave’s lasting value lies in its low-cost, permanent storage for digital assets like archives, NFTs, and decentralized social media. As adoption grows, it continues to serve as a core storage layer for Web3 applications that need data preservation. To Sum Up! Blockchain platforms are reshaping traditional industries, providing decentralized alternatives to centralized services. Helium offers a wireless network powered by user participation, while Arweave ensures permanent data storage. Both address specific needs within blockchain technology. However, Web3Bay takes a broader approach, aiming to disrupt e-commerce with lower fees and greater control for users. With $1.55 million raised in presale and growing recognition across crypto communities, Web3Bay stands out as a platform with the potential to challenge leading online marketplaces.

The exchange, once a dominant player in the crypto derivatives market, has enlisted Broadhaven Capital Partners, an investment banking firm, to facilitate a sale, according to a CoinDesk report . The development comes as BitMEX grapples with legal troubles, including a hefty $100 million fine over anti-money laundering violations. Broadhaven Capital Partners specializes in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) advisory and has worked with several financial institutions in securing strategic deals. The search for a buyer underscores the competitive landscape of the crypto derivatives market, where leading platforms are looking to consolidate their positions. BitMEX, founded in 2014, was once a pioneer in Bitcoin futures trading, but it has faced growing competition from rivals like Deribit, Binance, and Bybit. BitMEX’s reported sale efforts come amid a wave of mergers and acquisitions in the crypto industry. Notably, Deribit, the world’s leading Bitcoin and Ethereum options exchange, has been at the center of a bidding war between Coinbase and Kraken as both firms seek to expand their derivatives offerings. Meanwhile, FalconX, a prime brokerage firm, recently acquired Arbelos Markets , a trading firm specializing in crypto derivatives. The deal is part of FalconX’s expansion strategy to strengthen its presence in the derivatives sector, an area of growing interest for institutional investors. BitMEX’s attempt to find a buyer comes just over a month after a US court ordered the exchange to pay a $100 million fine for violating anti-money laundering laws. This follows a 2022 guilty plea from BitMEX and its co-founders, who had already paid $110 million in penalties. The legal troubles stem from a 2020 indictment that led to Arthur Hayes stepping down as CEO. The US Department of Justice had accused BitMEX’s leadership —including co-founders Ben Delo and Samuel Reed—of failing to implement proper compliance measures, allowing illicit transactions to flow through the exchange. As BitMEX explores a sale, the outcome could reshape the competitive landscape of the crypto derivatives industry. Whether a major player acquires the platform or it struggles to find a buyer remains to be seen. With regulatory scrutiny tightening, the fate of BitMEX will likely influence how other crypto exchanges navigate compliance and M&A strategies moving forward.

The price is now consolidating losses and remains at risk of more losses. XRP price started a fresh decline below the $2.250 level. The price is now trading below $2.220 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.20 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might continue to move down unless there is a close above the $2.30 resistance zone. XRP Price Dips Further XRP price failed to continue higher above the $2.350 resistance zone and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . There was a move below the $2.25 and $2.20 support levels. The price even dipped below the $2.120 support to enter a bearish zone. A low was formed at $2.0220 and the price is now struggling to stay above $2.0. The price is showing many bearish signs below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.363 swing high to the $2.022 low. The price is now trading below $2.10 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.120 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.20 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.363 swing high to the $2.022 low. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.20 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The next resistance is $2.30. A clear move above the $2.30 resistance might send the price toward the $2.350 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.420 resistance or even $2.450 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.50. More Losses? If XRP fails to clear the $2.20 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.020 level. The next major support is near the $2.00 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.00 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $1.9650 support. The next major support sits near the $1.880 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level.

The legal dispute, which began in December 2020, revolves around the SEC’s claim that Ripple sold XRP as an unregistered security. With growing regulatory scrutiny and political pressure, the crypto community is watching closely for any signs of resolution in the XRP lawsuit. Will the SEC Dismiss XRP Lawsuit After Closed-Door Meeting? The SEC’s Sunshine Act meeting focused on enforcement actions, administrative proceedings, and litigation settlements. While the agenda remains confidential, speculation is growing that the Ripple case was a topic of discussion. Recent decisions by the SEC to drop investigations into major crypto firms, including Coinbase and Uniswap, have fueled hopes that the XRP lawsuit may be nearing its conclusion. Legal experts have mixed opinions on the SEC’s next move . Former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel downplayed the speculation, stating, “There’s no more reason to think Ripple is on the agenda than at the last 200 meetings.” However, pro-XRP attorney Bill Morgan remains confident in Ripple’s position, pointing out that the SEC’s legal argument has weakened after Judge Analisa Torres ruled in 2023 that XRP itself is not a security. Cynthia Lummis Stance on SEC Dropping Lawsuits Against Major Firms U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis, a vocal advocate for cryptocurrency regulations, recently highlighted the need for legal clarity on digital assets. She stated, “Most digital assets are not legally securities under the Howey Test. The United States is behind other countries in creating laws for digital assets.” Responding to Lummis’ statement, Bill Morgan referenced the Ripple case and Judge Torres’ ruling. He wrote on X, “So you agree Judge Torres was correct in finding XRP itself is not a security in SEC v Ripple.” This exchange highlights the growing recognition among lawmakers and legal experts that the SEC’s classification of XRP may not hold up under legal scrutiny. Moreover, the SEC has recently withdrawn several high-profile lawsuits, signaling a possible shift in its enforcement strategy. The agency voluntarily dismissed its case against Coinbase Global Inc and Consensys reached an agreement to dismiss the securities enforcement case related to MetaMask. Concurrently, the agency has also dropped cases against Uniswap, Gemini, OpenSea, Robinhood Crypto, and Binance’s case being paused for 60 days. Potential Impact on XRP Price The XRP lawsuit has had a strong effect on Ripple’s market standing. On February 28, XRP declined by 7.59%, following broader market trends with Bitcoin price falling below the $80k support. However, analysts believe that if the US SEC drops its appeal, XRP price could experience a major rally to $320 . Historical price trends show that legal victories for Ripple have led to significant gains. When Judge Torres ruled in Ripple’s favor in July 2023, XRP surged by over 70%. A full dismissal of the XRP lawsuit could push the token toward its previous all-time high of $3.55. Market analysts are also discussing the potential approval of an XRP spot ETF, which could attract institutional investment especially with the agency acknowledging some XRP ETF’s last week. If the Ripple case is resolved, XRP may gain further regulatory clarity, making it more appealing to large financial firms. While speculation around the SEC meeting continues, no official decision has been announced regarding the XRP lawsuit. The next key deadline is April 16, 2025, when Ripple must submit its reply brief related to the SEC’s appeal. If the SEC decides to withdraw its appeal before then, the case could effectively be resolved.

Nevertheless, the coin’s dominance managed to stay up by 0.07%, signaling altcoins continue to face more pressure. ETH Price Slips Below $2,200 ETH price tanked over 7% in the past 24 hours, closing in at $2,152. The coin hit an intraday bottom and peak of $2,128.18 and $2,378.09, respectively. Ethereum recorded liquidations worth $166.28 million in the past 24 hours, rationalizing the slumping action. XRP Price Nears $2 Mark XRP price traded at $2.02 at the time of reporting, crashing 8% intraday. Ripple’s native coin hit a low and high of $2.02 and $2.25 over the past day.

The attack, which occurred on February 21, saw hackers infiltrate one of Bybit’s cold wallets and steal over 41,000 ETH. This breach added to a growing list of high-profile cryptocurrency heists orchestrated by North Korean hacking entities. US Authorities Sound Alarm on North Korea’s Crypto Heists In a joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) issued by the FBI, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the US Treasury Department, authorities warned about the increasing cyber risks posed by North Korea-backed advanced persistent threat (APT) groups. The Lazarus Group, also known by aliases such as APT38, BlueNoroff, and Stardust Chollima, has been conducting cyber theft operations since at least 2020. The entity has been known for systematically targeting cryptocurrency exchanges, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, play-to-earn gaming platforms, as well as venture capital firms investing in digital assets. The advisory outlined the group’s tactics, which include social engineering, spearphishing campaigns, and the deployment of trojanized cryptocurrency applications to infiltrate networks and exfiltrate funds. According to US authorities, North Korean hackers use sophisticated malware strains, including the notorious AppleJeus malware, to compromise cryptocurrency platforms. These cyber actors frequently exploit vulnerabilities in financial technology firms and blockchain infrastructure to launder stolen digital assets, ultimately funneling funds back to the North Korean regime. “TraderTraitor” The Bybit hack follows a familiar pattern, with attackers using deceptive recruitment tactics to lure employees into downloading compromised trading applications, referred to as “TraderTraitor.” These applications are designed with cross-platform JavaScript and Node.js to make them appear legitimate but contain hidden malware that allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to private keys and initiate fraudulent blockchain transactions. With North Korea’s cyber theft operations continuing to escalate, the US government has reiterated its commitment to combating illicit activities in the cryptocurrency sector. The FBI urges cryptocurrency firms to strengthen cybersecurity measures, monitor for indicators of compromise (IOCs), and implement robust security protocols to mitigate risks associated with North Korean-backed cyber threats.

While skeptics have long criticized cryptocurrency’s lack of intrinsic value, RWA platforms fundamentally reshape this narrative by bringing tangible assets – from real estate to equities – onto the blockchain. Four key players exemplify the sector’s maturation and growing institutional adoption. Their success underscores a crucial reality – RWA operates as a complex two-sided marketplace, requiring both willing asset owners and sophisticated investors. As Wall Street takes interest, a new batch of regulations that nurture the burgeoning sector is crucial for long-term growth. Pendle Pendle offers perhaps the most innovative approach to yield-bearing assets. Unlike traditional products where ownership and yield are inseparable, Pendle’s model allows separate trading of PT (principal tokens) and YT (yield tokens). This flexibility has driven their total value locked to $5.9 billion, five times larger than that of their nearest competitor. Their fixed yields for popular products reach as high as 14.7% for USDe, attracting investors seeking stable returns in volatile markets. Ethena Ethena’s trajectory demonstrates the critical role of venture capital in shaping the RWA landscape. Following a $14 million Series A round that attracted investments from Franklin Templeton and Fidelity, they’ve secured strategic partnerships with World Liberty Financial and Deribit. Their synthetic dollar, sUSDe, offering a six percent APY, represents a new generation of yield-bearing assets designed for institutional adoption. Ondo Ondo Finance exemplifies the sector’s push toward mainstream integration. Through partnerships with BlackRock and Morgan Stanley, they’ve launched tokenized versions of blue-chip stocks and ETFs, including Coca-Cola (onKO) and SPDR Gold Shares (onGLD). Their recent announcement of Ondo Chain – purpose-built for institutional-grade RWAs – signals growing confidence in the sector’s future. What makes these developments particularly significant is their timing. As retail investors grow increasingly sophisticated and demand more stable investment vehicles, RWA platforms offer a compelling solution. When the average US home price stands at $356,585, fractional ownership through tokenization democratizes access to previously exclusive asset classes. The regulatory environment appears increasingly supportive – particularly in the US – where stablecoin legislation is gaining momentum. This could provide a substantial boost to yield-bearing assets like Ondo’s USDY, currently unavailable to US investors. Wall Street’s latest (and biggest?) bet The RWA transformation extends beyond traditional finance – innovative projects are exploring tokenization of everything from aviation financing to electric motorcycle fleets, demonstrating the versatility of RWA platforms. However, challenges remain. The sector must navigate complex regulatory requirements, ensure robust security measures and build sufficient liquidity across various asset classes. Success requires substantial capital – evidenced by the aggressive fundraising among leading platforms – to secure regulatory approvals and build institutional-grade infrastructure. Even with these challenges, traditional financial institutions are taking notice. The involvement of firms like BlackRock, Morgan Stanley and Fidelity isn’t merely symbolic – i t represents a fundamental shift in how Wall Street views digital assets. These partnerships provide crucial infrastructure and credibility, helping bridge the gap between traditional and DeFi (decentralized finance). Yet the trajectory is clear. RWA tokenization represents more than just another blockchain use case – it’s a fundamental reimagining of how we interact with traditional assets. By breaking down barriers to investment and creating more efficient markets, these platforms are driving what may be the most profound cultural and economic impact within the crypto space. As we move through 2025, the question isn’t whether RWA will transform finance, but rather which platforms will emerge as the dominant players in this new paradigm. For investors and institutions alike, understanding this evolution isn’t just advantageous – it’s essential. The next phase of growth will likely come from increased institutional adoption, regulatory clarity and innovative applications that push the boundaries of what can be tokenized.

According to the FBI, the Bybit hack, known as “TraderTraitor,” is part of a wider series of cyberattacks attributed to North Korean state-sponsored hackers. Meanwhile, forensic investigations by Sygnia Labs and Verichain confirmed that Bybit’s security infrastructure remained intact despite the breach. A detailed post-mortem of the hack revealed that the vulnerability was linked to a Safe Wallet developer machine that had been compromised. The attackers exploited this machine to insert malicious JavaScript code into the Gnosis Safe UI, specifically targeting Bybit’s cold wallet. Safe has affirmed that its smart contracts are safe, but the incident shows that hackers are increasingly focusing on infrastructure providers rather than exchanges themselves. Bybit has launched a website to track the laundering of its stolen funds and is offering a bounty to exchanges that assist in recovering the assets.

While some analysts hope for a price reversal to the upside, others predict a further crash to $70,000, eradicating almost all gains achieved after the US election rally. Popular crypto analyst and Co-founder of BitMEX Arthur Hayes has shared a bearish prediction for the Bitcoin price. Hayes projects a further breakdown in Bitcoin’s value, suggesting an imminent drop between $70,000 and $75,000. Bitcoin Price Crash To $70,000 A Possibility The crypto founder shared a 2-hour Bitcoin price chart from BitMEX, explaining how the pioneer cryptocurrency could experience this decline and citing macroeconomic factors tied to United States (US) President Donald Trump as a trigger for this price drawdown. Related Reading: End Of The Road For Bitcoin? Analyst Reveals When Price Will Crash To $50,000 Hayes suggests that the market is entering a cooling phase, characterized by a potential retracement to pre-election liquidity levels. A cooling phase is a period during which the price of a cryptocurrency declines and consolidates as the market attempts to stabilize. It typically comes after a cryptocurrency experiences an explosive price increase. Looking at his price chart, the BitMEX Co-founder pinpointed a demand zone around the blue-shaded area between $76,000 and $65,000. This price range serves as a critical support area, where traders expect significant buying interest, enough to prevent further price declines. Hayes believes that the Bitcoin price’s possible decline to $70,000 hinges on Trump’s budget and debt ceiling decision. He suggests that if Trump fails to pass a budget that increases spending and raises the debt ceiling, then further market capitulation could occur. This means that the market may undergo a rapid sell-off by a large number of investors, triggering a panic that could lead to further declines in the Bitcoin price. Additionally, if Trump’s influence over the Republican Party weakens, Hayes indicates that market uncertainty could grow, potentially triggering a continuation of the current Bitcoin downturn. Moreover, a debt ceiling reduction could negatively impact the market’s liquidation and fuel more price fluctuations. Overall, Haye’s bearish outlook for Bitcoin is tied to Trump’s fiscal influence. The BitMEX Co-founder suggests that, for now, the market can only “chill out, retrace, and wait.” BTC’s 3-Day Decline Marks Highest Since FTX Crash According to MetaEra, the recent 3-day decline in the Bitcoin price is the highest crash seen since the FTX fiasco in 2022. In the first three days of this week, Bitcoin recorded a 12.6% drop in value, pushing it down to its current price of $86,227. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Prediction: Analyst Charts Roadmap To $117,000, What You Should Know MetaEra revealed that the widespread market sell-off could be attributed to the negative sentiment and disappointment over President Trump’s lack of swift action regarding his promises to the crypto community. Prior to his election, Trump indicated a strong interest in creating a national Bitcoin Reserve and tightening fiat liquidity conditions. With no mention of plans concerning these crucial initiatives, uncertainty looms, leading to a weakened market sentiment.

But that’s not all. The SEC has now dropped its case against Consensys, the company behind the popular MetaMask wallet. This is a big win for Ethereum and the crypto community. Joseph Lubin, the founder of Consensys, celebrated the news, saying it was a victory for blockchain developers who deserve a fair chance to grow without unnecessary legal challenges. He also pointed out that this lawsuit played a part in getting the SEC to drop its investigation into Ethereum itself. “Every legal and policy win might be hard fought, but each is an important step along the path to a better financial system and a better internet. We appreciate the SEC’s new leadership and the pro-innovation, pro-investor path they are taking. We will remain deeply engaged with public and private policymakers going forward,” he wrote. These legal victories are part of a bigger trend where some regulators, like Hester Peirce, are working to clear out cases that don’t involve fraud, making room for crypto projects to thrive. While these wins are big, there are still ongoing cases, such as those with Kraken and Ripple. Many hope these cases will also be paused or dropped, much like what happened with others. I'm pleased to announce that Consensys and the SEC have agreed in principle that the securities enforcement case concerning MetaMask should be dismissed. Subject to the approval of the Commission, the SEC will file a stipulation with the court that effectively closes the case.… — Joseph Lubin (@ethereumJoseph) February 27, 2025 Lubin concluded, “Now we can get 100% back to building. 2025 is going to be the best year yet for Ethereum and Consensys. The paradigm shift to a much more decentralized world is accelerating.” The dropping of these cases is seen as very positive for the market.

Ethereum (ETH) followed suit, falling below the $2,200 mark, while major altcoins, including XRP and Solana (SOL), shed nearly 8% in value. The downturn comes amid heightened global trade war concerns fueled by Donald Trump’s new tariffs on the EU, Canada, and Mexico, leading to widespread investor panic. With over $700 million worth of liquidations in the past 24 hours and a 4% decline in total market capitalization to $2.7 trillion, traders remain on edge about the next move. Bitcoin price drops as market volatility surges Bitcoin’s price fell by more than 5% in the last 24 hours, reaching a low of $79,523 before stabilizing at $80,430, according to CoinMarketCap data . The decline resulted in $365.91 million in BTC liquidations, signaling heightened sell-offs. However, Bitcoin’s market dominance increased by 0.07%, suggesting altcoins bore the brunt of the selling pressure. Ethereum witnessed a sharp 7% drop, sinking to $2,132 with an intraday low of $2,128.18. The second-largest cryptocurrency faced $166.28 million in liquidations as traders reacted to broader market trends. Source: CoinMarketCap Altcoins face heavy sell-offs XRP plunged 7% to $2.04, with liquidations totaling $17.94 million. Solana (SOL) dropped 8%, trading at $128.42. Despite the sell-off, market expert Raoul Pal remains optimistic, citing oversold conditions. Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) plummeted 8% despite whale accumulation and increased SHIB burn rates. Pepe Coin (PEPE) and TRUMP Coin saw the biggest losses, declining 12%-16%. Top gainers and losers in today’s crypto market While most cryptos bled, a few tokens managed to stay in the green: Top Gainers: Berachain (BERA): +4% ($7.71) Litecoin (LTC): +2% ($124.81) UNUS SED LEO (LEO): +1% ($9.20) Top Losers: Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL): -12% ($1.01) Raydium (RAY): -12% ($2.13) Meanwhile, the Asian stock markets tumbled on Friday after US President Donald Trump confirmed tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China, rattling investor sentiment. Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped 0.9%, while the Topix fell 0.68% in early trading. South Korea’s Kospi tumbled 1.54%, with the Kosdaq down 1.69%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index lost 1.14%, while Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 slipped 0.86%. China’s CSI 300 remained largely flat as investors assessed the potential impact of additional US trade measures. This renewed trade uncertainty weighed heavily on US markets, with all three major indexes closing lower. The S&P 500 fell 1.59% to 5,861.57, extending its weekly losses. The Nasdaq Composite tumbled 2.78% to 18,544.42, dragged down by an 8.5% drop in Nvidia, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 193.62 points (0.45%) to close at 43,239.50. The crypto market continues to grapple with macroeconomic pressures and liquidity challenges, leading to heightened uncertainty. With Bitcoin and Ethereum at critical support levels, traders remain cautious, awaiting further market signals.

Adding to the momentum, ETH transaction fees have dropped to just $0.40 – the lowest since July 2020. This reduction in costs could provide the push needed for ETH to break past the $3,000 mark and beyond. Meanwhile, Bitcoin could also get a potential boost with the emergence of PlutoChain ($PLUTO). This project introduces smart contracts to Bitcoin, paving the way for deeper DeFi integration and expanding its real-world use cases beyond the current transactional one. Let’s check out the details. Ethereum’s Transaction Fees Drop to Multi-Year Lows – Is a Major Rally on the Horizon? Ethereum has once again made the news as its transaction fees have crashed to a stunning $0.40, a multi-year low last seen in 2020. This sharp drop, with the 7-day average tumbling 70% to $0.77 earlier this week, has slashed costs from January’s highs, sparking a wave of bullish excitement. ETH sits at $2,819, and with fees this cheap, analysts predict a price explosion as adoption soars. Ethereum 7-day chart, Source: CoinMarketCap Resistance at $2,800 and $2,925 is in sight, and the daily chart’s bullish triangle could catapult ETH past these if volume, now at $16 billion daily, roars back to January’s $25 billion peak. The RSI, hovering at 32-35, is primed for a bullish flip from oversold territory. The fee drop, tied to upgrades like Dencun, is a game-changer – lower costs mean more users, dApps, and DeFi action, historically a rocket for ETH’s price (think 2020-2021’s surge). All of this has led analysts to believe that a surge is ahead. Coin Signals points out that all of these events will lead to a price surge between $3,600-$5,800 while Dohimai sees a 20-22% increase by the end of March. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) Could Draw Whale Interest With its Innovative Layer-2 Blockchain For Bitcoin – Greatly Improves Speed, Scalability and Expansion PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could get whale attention with its clever take on a hybrid Layer-2 blockchain built to improve Bitcoin’s network. It keeps the security we all trust and increases the speed instead. Test runs show it can tackle over 43,200 transactions a day, pushing scalability to new heights. For Bitcoin, this means stepping beyond its “digital gold” role into something you’d actually use daily. Developers find a lot to like here. PlutoChain introduces smart contracts into Bitcoin’s toolkit, letting them craft decentralized apps with ease. It’s got Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility too, so they can port their Ethereum projects over to Bitcoin without any problems. Users have quick, low-cost transactions and DeFi features like lending or staking, all wrapped in Bitcoin’s sturdy framework. Bitcoin’s DeFi presence remains negligible compared to Ethereum’s $64 billion in Total Value Locked or Solana’s high-throughput network. PlutoChain could position Bitcoin to compete more effectively by combining its unmatched security with DeFi capabilities. While it’s not poised to overtake Ethereum or Solana outright, it strengthens Bitcoin’s presence in that sector. PlutoChain has undergone rigorous audits by reputable firms including SolidProof, QuillAudits, and Assure DeFi, ensuring its smart contracts and infrastructure meet high standards. Additionally, its decentralized governance model empowers community members to vote on protocol decisions – creating transparency and involvement. PlutoChain aims to enhance Bitcoin with speed, scalability, and expanded functionality, offering developers a robust platform and users practical advantages. As a Layer-2 solution, it could elevate Bitcoin’s potential in DeFi and beyond, making it a project worth watching. Conclusion Ethereum’s sharp drop in transaction fees to $0.40 could be the catalyst for its next major rally, with analysts predicting a surge past $3,000 and potentially up to $5,800. Lower fees historically drive adoption, fueling DeFi activity and network usage. At the same time, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could expand Bitcoin’s overall utility in areas such as DeFi and more by adding smart contracts support to its secure network. Audited and community-led, this project might bring a steady, intriguing upgrade to Bitcoin’s underdeveloped network. ——- Disclaimer: It’s important to note that participating in presales carries risks, including market volatility and potential project delays.

The past 24 hours tell a different story, with only 21,956,446 SHIB burnt, marking a 27.19% decline compared to the previous day. Despite this supply reduction, SHIB’s price remains under pressure, dropping 7.03% in the past 24 hours to trade at $0.00001341. The meme coin’s market cap has also taken a hit, falling 7.02% to $7.85 billion. With selling pressure mounting, investors are watching closely to see if the recent burn activity can counteract the prevailing bearish sentiment.

SHIB chart by TradingView SHIB faces strong resistance SHIB continues to face resistance at $0.000015, a level that has consistently prevented upward momentum. The latest price action suggests that traders remain cautious, with the token’s 24-hour decline of 7.03% reinforcing concerns about further downside movement. At the same time, SHIB’s total supply remains high at 589.25 trillion tokens, meaning burn events alone may not be enough to trigger significant price appreciation in the short term. On-chain data from Coinglass shows that SHIB futures open interest (OI) has dropped significantly, suggesting that traders are cutting exposure amid heightened volatility. Source: Coinglass With major liquidation areas identified at $0.00001413 on the lower end and $0.000015 on the upper side, market sentiment remains a key factor in determining SHIB’s next move. Source: Coinglass If the price continues to slide and reaches $0.00001413, nearly $350,000 worth of long positions could be liquidated. Conversely, a breakout to $0.000015 could see approximately $750,000 in short positions wiped out. The overall decline in trading volumes further signals a lack of strong buying interest at current levels. Can burn strategy support SHIB? While SHIB’s weekly burn rate has increased, the decline in daily burns raises questions about whether supply reductions alone can support a price rebound. The token’s value has now fallen over 7% in just 24 hours and more than 22% in the past month, showing that broader market trends continue to weigh on its performance. Historically, SHIB has relied on strong community engagement and speculative interest to fuel rallies. The latest pullback suggests that investor enthusiasm is fading, with reduced futures open interest indicating a cautious approach from traders. Without a major catalyst, SHIB may continue to struggle against key resistance levels. If market sentiment does not improve, SHIB could retest its support level at $0.000013, potentially leading to further losses. Meanwhile, traders will be monitoring whether burn activity can regain momentum, as a slowdown in token removals may further limit the chances of a sustained price recovery. The upcoming weeks will be critical in determining whether SHIB can regain traction or if the bearish trend will deepen further.

How Low Will BTC Price Go?,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-bitcoin-is-dropping-how-low-btc-price-will-drop/,"The post Why is Bitcoin Dropping? How Low Will BTC Price Go? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bloodshed in the crypto market doesn’t seem to be stopping as nearly $700 billion has been wiped out. In the past eight days, Bitcoin has fallen from $99,000 to $79,000, losing all the gains it made from the hype around President Trump’s pro-crypto policies. But what is causing this sudden drop, and how low can Bitcoin go? Bitcoin Hits a Four-Month Low Bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency, has fallen more than 5% in the last 24 hours, hitting a four-month low of $79,263 . One major reason for this drop is growing fear in the market due to President Trump’s tariff threats, which have created uncertainty in the economy. At the same time, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index has fallen to 21, its lowest level in nearly three years. This shows that many investors are scared and unsure about the market. Short-Term Holders Lose Over $2 Billion Many of the recent Bitcoin losses come from short-term holders (STHs) who have sold their Bitcoin in panic. In the last three days alone, these holders have lost $2.16 billion . Investors who bought Bitcoin in the last week lost $927 million. Those who bought in the last month lost $678 million. Holders who had Bitcoin for one to twelve months lost $257 million. Even those who bought in the last 24 hours lost $322 million. This shows that many new investors are losing confidence and rushing to sell. Meme Coins Under Regulatory Pressure The U.S. SEC recently said that meme coins are not securities. While this sounds like good news, it made the situation worse. Many meme coins rely on hype and social trends, and with Bitcoin dropping, meme coins have also crashed, adding more panic to the market. Disappointment with Trump’s Crypto Promises Bitcoin’s decline is also linked to disappointment with President Trump’s crypto plans. Many investors expected strong pro-crypto policies, but things are moving slower than expected. This has led to selling pressure on cryptocurrencies that gained from Trump’s support. Altcoins Also Suffer Heavy Losses Bitcoin’s drop has affected the whole market. Other major cryptocurrencies have also fallen. Ethereum (ETH) is down 7.5%, XRP has dropped 8.2%, and Solana (SOL) has fallen 9%. This shows that investors are losing trust in the crypto market. How Low Can Bitcoin Go? Bitcoin’s price drop has made traders worried. Some believe Bitcoin needs to fill a gap near $80,000 before recovering. Meanwhile, Crypto analyst AlphaBTC thinks that if Bitcoin fills this gap, it could start a new rally. But if it doesn’t, the price could fall further to $73,000. At the same time, Bitcoin options data shows that more traders are betting on Bitcoin dropping to $70,000. This suggests that some investors believe the market could get even worse.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-28 05:08:22

ADA is now consolidating losses and at risk of more losses below the $0.60 level. ADA price started a fresh decline below the $0.6850 and $0.650 levels. The price is trading below $0.6550 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.660 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears the $0.70 resistance zone. Cardano Price Dips Further After a decent increase, Cardano faced resistance near the $0.70 zone. ADA formed a short-term top and recently started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . There was a move below the $0.6850 and $0.6650 levels. The bears were able to push the price below $0.6350. A low was formed at $0.6016 and the price is now consolidating losses. It is still below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $0.6769 swing high to the $0.6016 low. Cardano price is now trading below $0.650 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.620 zone. The first resistance is near $0.640 and the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $0.6769 swing high to the $0.6016 low. The next key resistance might be $0.660. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.660 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. If there is a close above the $0.660 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $0.680 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $0.70 in the near term. More Losses in ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $0.660 resistance level, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $0.60 level. The next major support is near the $0.5850 level. A downside break below the $0.5850 level could open the doors for a test of $0.550. The next major support is near the $0.50 level where the bulls might emerge. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ADA/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.

Is it the community, the hype, or the potential for massive gains? This week, three trending meme coins are catching the attention of investors looking for opportunities. BTFD Coin (BTFD) continues its record-breaking presale, Just A Chill Guy (CHILLGUY) is riding a 25.9% weekly surge, and Bonk (BONK) is stabilizing after its latest 3.5% gain. Meme coins have evolved beyond just internet jokes—they’ve become serious contenders in the crypto space. BTFD Coin is redefining investor incentives with its referral program and massive staking rewards, while Just A Chill Guy embraces the chill meme culture and Bonk continues to dominate Solana’s meme scene. Let’s break down what makes these three meme coins some of the best cryptos for beginners right now . BTFD Coin: Bulls Squad Expands as Referral Rewards Boost Investors Can a single meme coin redefine the way people invest in crypto? BTFD Coin is making a strong case for it. The presale has already raised over $6.21 million, with more than 70 billion tokens sold and a community of 11,100+ holders growing daily. Unlike traditional meme coins, BTFD is packed with real-world utility, including a play-to-earn (P2E) game, staking rewards of up to 90% APY, and an explosive referral program—one of the key reasons it’s among the best cryptos for beginners right now. The BTFD referral program is turning heads, giving investors 10% of the raise amount in BTFD tokens if they rank in the top 20 referrers. This means that active community members can earn a significant portion of their investment back just by spreading the word. With its Stage 14 price at just $0.00016, investors see the opportunity for a potential 3650% ROI when it lists at $0.006—a moonshot that’s drawing in new buyers by the minute.

There’s an absolute bloodbath on the Satoshi Street with BTC and other digital assets extending weekly losses to more than 20-25%. Crypto Market Crash Erases $900 Billion Ever since US President Donald Trump kickstarted the trade war on January 20, the crypto market crash led to erasing more than $900 billion in just over a month’s time. Since the Trump inauguration, the total crypto market cap has dropped from $3.7 trillion to $2.8 trillion. On the monthly chart, Bitcoin price is down more than 21% after facing rejection at $106K levels. BTC losses have further exacerbated after the asset lost the crucial support of $95K. Below is the chart of how Bitcoin has behaved after Trump announces trade wars with Mexico, Canada, and recently Europe. Source: The Kobeissi Letter Gold Takes the Limelight Over Bitcoin The recent development shows that BTC has been subject to market uncertainties and has behaved exactly opposite to the yellow metal gold, which has been trending higher. Throughout the trade war, the price of gold continued to inch higher, extending its year-to-date gains to nearly 10%. Gold has reclaimed its position as a favored global hedge amid uncertainty. Last week, Gold ETFs purchased an impressive 52 tonnes of the metal, marking the highest weekly inflow since July 2020. Over the past 12 months, gold prices have surged by more than 50%, recently achieving their best annual performance in over a decade. Source: The Kobeissi Letter How Low Can Bitcoin Price Fall? Crypto analyst Justin Bennett suggests that Bitcoin may be on track to close the $77,360 CME gap from November, potentially aligning with the September 2023 trendline. In a recent post, Bennett expressed skepticism about Bitcoin’s ability to maintain its current levels. “For Bitcoin to avoid a bearish outlook, it would need a miraculous February close above $92,000,” Bennett stated. However, he added, “The odds aren’t looking good.” Source: Justin Bennet BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes stated: “We are making lower lows in this current wave. I was tempted to add risk this morning, but looking at this price action I think we have one more violent wave down below $80k, most likely over the weekend, then crickets for a while”. On the other hand, CryptoQuant CEO still believes that the Bitcoin bull run hasn’t ended, and it is very unlikely that the Bitcoin price will fall under $77,000, in this crypto market crash. Ethereum (ETH) Leads Altcoins Crash to $2,100 Ethereum has been leading altcoins market crash, dropping an additional 8% today and moving all the way to $2,100. With today’s drop, ETH has completely erased its post-election rally. Ethereum has declined by nearly 50% from its peak following the late-2024 election. As of press time, ETH price is trading 7.74% down at $2,136, losing $30 billion in the last 24 hours. Source: TradingView Apart from ETH, some of the other top altcoins have also lost anywhere between 8-10%. XRP price has crashed 8% today, moving all the way to $2.0. Solana (SOL) also dropped by 8% to $126 levels, with dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA) seeing correction of a similar magnitude losing crucial support levels. In today’s crypto market crash, the overall crypto market liquidation has soared to more than $860 million as per Coinglass data . Of the total liquidations, $707 million has been in long liquidations alone. Crypto Market Faces Major Liquidity Crisis Tight liquidity conditions in the market have been the key reason behind the steep fall in the crypto market recently. Of the total monthly market correction, $760 billion have been eroded just within the last 60 hours, noted The Kobeissi Letter, in the absence of liquidity. Source: The Kobeissi Letter Much of the global liquidity is finding its way back into the US Dollar during ongoing trade tensions. Often seen as the “safest risky asset,” the USD benefits from its reputation as one of the world’s most stable currencies. Thus, the USD has been sucking out the liquidity from crypto and the rest og global markets.

In Texas, the Senate Banking Committee has advanced a bill that could establish a Bitcoin and cryptocurrency strategic reserve, positioning the state as a leader in digital asset adoption. Meanwhile, at the national level, Standard Chartered has projected that Bitcoin could reach $200,000 this year and potentially $500,000 before the end of President Donald Trump’s second term, citing increasing institutional adoption and evolving regulatory clarity. Bitcoin’s Path to $500K? Standard Chartered Sees Trump’s Presidency as a Net Positive for BTC The first month of Donald Trump’s presidency has been anything but stable for risk assets, but his administration could prove to be a long-term boon for Bitcoin, according to Standard Chartered. Despite recent volatility, the bank sees significant upside for the leading cryptocurrency, predicting a price surge to $200,000 this year and an eventual climb to $500,000 before the end of Trump’s second term. Geoffrey Kendrick, head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, made the bold projection in a recent interview with CNBC. He attributed the potential rally to growing institutional adoption and an increasingly favorable regulatory environment, both of which could propel Bitcoin to unprecedented heights. “It’s institutions like ours that now offer custody businesses that are much more secure than the hacks,” Kendrick noted. This sentiment reflects a broader trend where traditional financial institutions are playing a more active role in crypto markets. The approval and launch of multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US have driven institutional demand, reinforcing the narrative that Bitcoin is becoming a mainstream financial asset. While the long-term outlook appears optimistic, Bitcoin’s short-term price action has been far from smooth. After reaching an all-time high of $109,000 in January, BTC has since retraced to around $80,000, weighed down by macroeconomic concerns and geopolitical tensions. President Trump’s aggressive trade policies—particularly his renewed tariff threats against China, Canada, and Mexico—have rattled global markets, contributing to Bitcoin’s recent correction. The Kobeissi Letter, a well-regarded market commentary platform, pointed out that Bitcoin’s sharp reaction to tariff threats shows its growing correlation with equities and broader liquidity conditions. Historically viewed as a hedge against traditional markets, Bitcoin now appears more intertwined with macroeconomic events than ever before. Despite the short-term turbulence, industry experts believe Bitcoin remains in a strong bull cycle. Global Macro Investor analyst Julien Bittel emphasized that corrections are normal in bull markets, particularly following a sharp run-up in price after the US presidential election. Meanwhile, Jamie Coutts, chief crypto analyst at Real Vision, highlighted that two out of three key liquidity indicators have turned bullish despite the recent downturn. Expanding central bank balance sheets and increasing global money supply typically create a favorable backdrop for Bitcoin’s price appreciation. The final piece of the puzzle, according to Coutts, is the US dollar’s trajectory—if the greenback weakens, Bitcoin’s upward momentum could accelerate. Security Concerns Remain a Challenge While institutional players are bringing credibility and legitimacy to the crypto sector, security risks remain a major concern. The recent $1.4-billion hack of crypto exchange Bybit is a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities still present in digital asset markets. Standard Chartered’s prediction of a $500,000 Bitcoin hinges on a combination of factors, including regulatory clarity, institutional investment, and macroeconomic shifts. If Trump’s policies lead to greater financial uncertainty or currency devaluation, Bitcoin could benefit as investors seek non-traditional stores of value. As the crypto market continues to evolve, Bitcoin’s ability to weather volatility and attract mainstream adoption will be critical in determining whether it can reach—and sustain—these ambitious price targets. Texas Moves Forward With Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Bill, Setting Precedent for US States In related news, the Texas Senate Banking Committee unanimously approved Senate Bill 21 (SB-21), which proposes the establishment of a Bitcoin and cryptocurrency strategic reserve. The 9–0 vote on Feb. 27 clears the path for the bill to advance to the Texas Senate floor for further deliberation, where it could become one of the most significant state-level cryptocurrency policies in the US. If passed, the bill would authorize the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts to acquire, sell, and trade digital assets as part of the state’s financial reserves. Advocates argue that Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies offer a hedge against inflation and economic volatility, providing Texans with enhanced financial security. The passage of SB-21 in the committee follows growing interest among US states in adopting Bitcoin as a financial safeguard. Oklahoma, Arizona, and Utah are also considering similar legislation to diversify their state reserves, reflecting broader concerns over the declining purchasing power of the US dollar and rising inflation. The bill originally focused exclusively on Bitcoin when it was first introduced by Texas State Senator Charles Schwertner in January 2025. However, following US President Donald Trump’s executive order on Jan. 23, which directed a commission to study the feasibility of a ”digital asset stockpile,” the bill was revised to include other digital assets in February. This shift aligns with Trump’s broader crypto-friendly stance, reinforcing his administration’s push to integrate digital assets into state and national economic strategies. While the move has been widely celebrated among Bitcoin supporters, some analysts remain cautious. Iliya Kalchev, an analyst at crypto platform Nexo, noted that the Feb. 18 public hearing for SB-21 was more symbolic than an immediate Bitcoin adoption or price catalyst. However, Pierre Rochard, vice president of research at Riot Platforms, a major Bitcoin mining company, provided testimony in support of the bill. He highlighted that while Texas currently enjoys a strong economy, it must prepare for future economic downturns and fiscal uncertainty. ”Public trust in financial institutions has eroded due to a lack of transparency, but Bitcoin is unique because it is fully auditable,” Rochard emphasized. His testimony echoed growing concerns that traditional financial systems are becoming increasingly fragile, with government overspending, debt accumulation, and inflation threatening long-term economic stability. Texas: A Crypto and Bitcoin Mining Hub Texas has long been a pro-crypto state, hosting some of the largest Bitcoin mining operations in the US due to its low electricity costs and deregulated energy market. The state has also enacted pro-mining legislation and has positioned itself as a leader in blockchain innovation. The introduction of a Bitcoin-backed reserve fund would further cement Texas’ status as a Bitcoin-friendly jurisdiction, potentially attracting even more investment and crypto businesses. However, challenges remain. If passed, the bill would require Texas to develop a framework for securely managing digital assets, including issues related to custody, price volatility, and regulatory oversight. Texas’ move to establish a Bitcoin strategic reserve could set a precedent for other US states to follow. If successful, it may lead to wider state-level Bitcoin adoption and force federal regulators to reassess their stance on Bitcoin and crypto-backed reserves. The potential expansion of state-level Bitcoin adoption also signals a shift in how policymakers view digital assets—not just as speculative investments but as legitimate financial instruments capable of hedging against inflation and financial instability. If Bitcoin is increasingly recognized as a strategic reserve asset, it could pave the way for broader government adoption, including federal reserves or even sovereign Bitcoin holdings in the future. The unanimous approval of SB-21 by the Texas Senate Banking Committee is a historic milestone in Bitcoin's integration into traditional financial systems. While some analysts remain skeptical about its immediate impact, the bill represents a growing recognition of Bitcoin’s role in financial security. With Trump’s executive order pushing for further digital asset integration, Texas may be at the forefront of a new era of Bitcoin adoption at the state level. If passed into law, SB-21 could mark the beginning of Bitcoin’s formal role in state financial reserves, setting the stage for broader institutional and governmental acceptance in the years ahead.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|REGULATION|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-28 05:30:00

According to MakroVision, Ethereum remains weak after falling below the lower orange support zone. ETH is currently trading near the lower Fibonacci support levels, making a reversal at this stage crucial to avoid further downside pressure. According to the analytics firm, if Ethereum manages to bounce, the key breakout zone is located between $2,810 and $2,880, along with a red trendline. This range serves as a crucial area for a potential trend reversal as it also houses several liquidity zones that could attract price action.

Consensys was accused of operating as an unregistered securities broker, as part of a larger crackdown led by former SEC Chair Gary Gensler.

Instead, the agency sees them more like collectibles—something people buy for fun rather than as a real financial asset. However, just because meme coins aren’t regulated like stocks doesn’t mean scammers can get away with fraud. The SEC warned that if someone uses meme coins to mislead people or run scams, they could still face legal trouble. The SEC has released guidance that memecoins are not securities and are akin to collectibles. https://t.co/8tRsuHHqbJ — David Sacks (@davidsacks47) February 27, 2025 Meme Coins: Not Securities, Says SEC According to the SEC’s latest statement , meme coins do not meet the legal definition of securities under the Securities Act of 1933. Unlike stocks or investment contracts, Meme coins don’t give holders any rights to future profits, income, or ownership in a company. Because of this, the SEC doesn’t require meme coin creators or traders to register with them, meaning they don’t have to follow the same rules as traditional investments. However, this also means investors won’t get the usual protections from the SEC, exposing them to the risk of fraud, pump-dump schemes, and misleading advertising. Legal experts, including Bain Capital Crypto’s Khurram Dara, highlighted that even though the SEC won’t directly regulate meme coins, other federal or state agencies could take action against deceptive practices to protect investors. A New Bill Emerges Before the SEC’s statement, House Democrats had already been pushing the Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement (MEME) Act, aimed at restricting public officials from launching or endorsing meme coins. The bill, spearheaded by California Representative Sam Liccardo, came in response to Donald Trump’s controversial “ TRUMP” meme coin , which saw a dramatic rise and fall in value. Lawmakers fear that such tokens could be exploited for personal or political gain, raising ethical concerns. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto News: Consensys Wins Big as SEC Drops Case Over MetaMask Wallet , Crypto Community Reacts The SEC’s stance has sparked mixed reactions in the crypto space. Some industry players see it as a positive move, arguing that regulatory clarity will encourage more investment in meme coins, particularly on US-based blockchains like Solana . Crypto lawyer Ishmael Green noted that with meme coins officially outside securities laws, exchanges like Coinbase and Robinhood may feel more confident listing them, which could lead to a surge in market activity. Following the announcement, shares of major crypto exchanges saw a slight uptick, reflecting optimism within the industry. Meanwhile, in a surprising turn, the SEC is dropping its lawsuits against Coinbase, Consensys, and Gemini, signaling a positive change for crypto assets. With the MEME Act on the horizon and the SEC shifting gears, the regulations scene for crypto—especially meme coins—is changing fast. Whether these changes bring more clarity or confusion remains to be seen. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

40944970,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=683974,1740721664,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40944970.jpeg,Judge blocks Elon Musk’s DOGE from mass-firing federal workers,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/judge-blocks-elon-musk-doge-firing/,"On Thursday, Federal Judge William Alsup told the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to cancel its earlier orders from Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) that told agencies to “promptly determine” whether certain employees should stay or be fired. The judge didn’t just stop the terminations—he called the entire process illegal and said it should have never happened in the first place. The OPM had sent out a January 20 memo and a February 14 internal email, both pushing agencies to decide the fate of probationary employees. Alsup wasn’t having it. He ordered OPM to notify the Department of Defense that those terminations were invalid—and he wants this done before the planned firings happen. He also ordered a hearing, where acting OPM Director Charles Ezell will have to testify. No date has been set yet. Judge: OPM had no right to order mass firings Alsup made it clear that OPM had no legal authority to force these agencies to fire employees. “The Office of Personnel Management does not have any authority whatsoever under any statute in the history of the universe to hire and fire employees within another agency,” he said. “It can hire its own employees, yes. Can fire them. But it cannot order or direct some other agency to do so.” He also called probationary workers “the lifeblood of our government”—people who enter at lower levels and move up over time. The government, he said, depends on them to keep things running. The lawsuit against DOGE came from unions, including the American Federation of Labor, arguing that Musk’s agency was violating the Privacy Act and the Administrative Procedure Act by trying to access Labor Department data. Judge John Bates of Washington, D.C., ordered at least one DOGE official to testify and hand over documents, marking the first time someone inside D.O.G.E has been legally forced to answer questions under oath from an outside attorney. Bates called D.O.G.E “opaque”, meaning the agency operates with little transparency. The ruling could reveal how DOGE really functions inside the federal system and what data it has access to. DOGE under fire for secrecy and overreach Bates also approved four depositions with staffers at the Department of Health and Human Services, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Labor Department, and D.O.G.E. The unions pushing the case want proof that D.O.G.E is illegally accessing federal records. The judge ruled that these depositions should be limited to eight hours total, but it’s unclear if the public will ever see them. The unions that filed the lawsuit are seeking to block DOGE from accessing Labor Department data, arguing that access to such sensitive information systems would violate the Privacy Act and the Administrative Procedure Act. Another case against DOGE, filed by the Center for Biological Diversity, argues that the agency is dodging federal transparency laws. This group, which focuses on protecting the environment, says the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has refused to release information on D.O.G.E’s actions, despite Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) rules requiring federal agencies to disclose records upon request. D.O.G.E has faced over 20 lawsuits , but this is the first one focused entirely on transparency laws. The Center for Biological Diversity suit claims that because DOGE is deliberately moving quickly to cut government funding and staff, and its efforts will have effects on the environment (the Environmental Protection Agency has said D.O.G.E helped it make significant cuts, for instance), it’s urgent to uncover more details about how D.O.G.E operates. The FOIA lawsuit argues that the government should not be allowed to make drastic staffing cuts in secrecy. “FOIA was designed to ensure that monumental and consequential undertakings such as this could not take place without transparency,” the lawsuit says. It also warns that D.O.G.E’s staffing cuts could “harm, undermine, or negate” federal climate protections, land management, and public health regulations. Government argues it was just ‘guidance’ There was a major dispute over whether OPM’s mid-February calls to agencies were actual orders or just “requests”. Alsup wasn’t convinced. He pointed out that when something happens at the same time across multiple agencies, it sounds more like an order than mere “guidance.” “Something aberrational happens, not just in one agency, but all across the government, in many agencies on the same day, the same thing,” Alsup said. “Doesn’t that sound like to you that somebody ordered it to happen, as opposed to, ‘Oh, we just got guidance’?” Assistant U.S. Attorney Kelsey Helland, the government’s lawyer, disagreed. “An order is not usually phrased as a request,” she argued. “Asking is not ordering to do something.” She suggested that impacted employees should take their cases to the Office of Special Counsel or the Merit Systems Protection Board instead of seeking a restraining order. Danielle Leonard, an attorney for the unions, pushed back. “Are they really contending to this court that all of these federal employees are lying, Your Honor?” she asked. “That’s what counsel is saying. I don’t think it’s credible.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Both the stock market and crypto assets like Bitcoin are showing significant declines. This week, Bitcoin ETFs saw massive outflows. On Monday, over $500 million left, followed by a staggering $11 billion outflow on Tuesday, the largest in history. Wednesday saw another record with $754 million leaving the Bitcoin ETFs, particularly affecting the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF. In response to the outflows, BlackRock had to sell a record amount of Bitcoin on Wednesday to fulfill the withdrawal requests, marking the largest single-day Bitcoin sale for the ETF provider. As for Bitcoin price, the largest cryptocurrency has dipped below $80,000 and most altcoins have followed suit. XRP is down by more than 9% and is dangerously close to dropping below the $2 mark. Over the last 24 hours, XRP has confirmed a daily candle close below a crucial support zone between $2.25 and $2.30. According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, this area has previously shown multiple bounces, making it a key level for traders. With this break, the next significant support lies between $1.95 and $2. Next Major Support at $2 If the price drops below the $2 level, specifically under $1.95 or $1.90, it could signal more major losses for XRP. This would likely lead to much lower price levels in the near future. Current Bearish Trend XRP is currently in a bearish trend, marked by breaking below support levels, rejecting resistance, and forming lower highs and lows. This bearish price action suggests further downward movement in the short term.

The lawsuit, claiming XRP was sold as an unregistered security, has drawn attention as the SEC recently dropped several high-profile cases. If the SEC dismisses the appeal, XRP’s price could surge, with analysts predicting a potential rally to $3.20 following Ripple’s previous legal victories. February 28, 2025 06:13:02 UTC Pi Network Listing on Binance Gains Support with 86% Community Vote Binance has completed a community vote that may lead to the listing of Pi Coin (PI) on the platform. With 86% of the 294,957 participants voting in favor, this marks a significant move toward integrating Pi Network’s native cryptocurrency into Binance’s offerings. However, Binance clarified that the vote results are for reference only, and the decision will be subject to further evaluation. Pi Coin, which has grown to over 60 million members, saw a 20.8% price drop following its ATH but has still outperformed the broader crypto market. The Pi Network community is also looking forward to Pi Day on March 14, 2025, which could bring further excitement and developments for the coin. February 28, 2025 06:07:13 UTC When Will Crypto Go Back Up? After recent corrections, the market appears to have found a solid demand zone, potentially setting up for a bounce. Bitcoin ($BTC) could reach $97K-$100K, Ethereum ($ETH) may hit $3K, and altcoins could experience a 10%-30% rally. This bounce may be triggered not only by technical factors but also by NVIDIA’s record-breaking earnings and the upcoming US PCE Price Index data. Investors are watching closely as the Fed evaluates its policies based on this data, which could influence market movements further. February 28, 2025 05:46:55 UTC Bitcoin News Today : BTC Price Crash Below $80K Bitcoin’s spot volume surged around the $100K mark, but during distribution phases, prices tend to drop when new liquidity dries up. The key question now is where fresh liquidity will come from to sustain a bullish trend. With limited new liquidity entering the market, an extended consolidation within a wide range ($75K-$100K) seems likely, similar to early 2024. This range-bound movement could persist until favorable news for Bitcoin triggers new liquidity inflows. February 28, 2025 05:46:55 UTC What Happened To Crypto Today? Bitcoin (BTC) fell below its 200-day simple moving average (SMA) on Friday, marking a 16% weekly loss and briefly dipping below $80,000 for the first time since November 10. The decline was fueled by renewed concerns over U.S. tariffs, which boosted demand for the U.S. dollar.

The proposed legislation seeks to ban senior US officials and their family members from engaging in the issuance, sponsorship, or endorsement of digital assets, securities, and commodities. This move comes in direct response to the launch of the $TRUMP meme coin, a cryptocurrency tied to former President Donald Trump, which has faced significant volatility since its debut. Although the MEME Act is unlikely to pass under the current Republican-led Congress, its introduction signals growing concern over political figures leveraging digital assets for personal financial gain. If Democrats regain control in the 2026 midterm elections, the bill’s prospects could improve, potentially forcing Trump to return any profits made from the controversial token. The debate raises broader questions about regulatory oversight and ethical boundaries in the crypto space, particularly as political figures increasingly embrace Web3. Trump-linked tokens spark concerns The timing of the $TRUMP and $MELANIA tokens’ launches—just days before the US presidential inauguration—has fueled accusations of financial exploitation. Source: Coingecko The $TRUMP coin saw an initial surge to over $74, only to crash 82% from its peak, while the $MELANIA token has plummeted 93% from its all-time high. Source: Coingecko Despite Trump’s previous advocacy for a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment, his direct association with these digital assets has drawn criticism. Investors who suffered heavy losses have taken to social media, questioning whether political figures should have such influence over speculative markets. The volatility of these tokens has also raised concerns about potential insider trading and foreign financial influence over the executive branch. This is not the first time the former president has ventured into the Web3 space. Trump previously launched a series of NFTs, a move that mirrored a broader trend of politicians experimenting with blockchain-based assets. With the MEME Act now on the table, lawmakers are signalling that such activities by public officials may soon face stricter scrutiny. Crypto bill faces legislative hurdles While the MEME Act has little chance of passing in the current political climate, its introduction highlights the increasing legislative focus on cryptocurrency ethics. The bill’s failure would not necessarily mean the issue will fade, as calls for greater transparency and accountability in political finance continue to grow. Regulating the participation of elected officials in crypto markets could set a precedent for broader industry-wide reforms. Some analysts argue that, even if the MEME Act does not pass, its proposed restrictions on digital asset endorsements could inspire similar measures in future financial regulation bills. A complete ban on political involvement in digital currencies is unlikely, but lawmakers may push for disclosure requirements and independent oversight as alternative solutions. This could help ensure that public officials are held accountable while allowing legitimate crypto industry growth to continue. Regulation aims to restore trust The MEME Act underscores a broader debate about the ethical implications of public servants engaging in speculative investments. Trust in democratic institutions relies on a clear separation between political power and personal financial gain, yet the growing involvement of politicians in crypto-related ventures blurs these lines. With increasing regulatory efforts in the cryptocurrency space, from Biden’s executive order on digital assets to Europe’s MiCA framework, the MEME Act is part of a global movement towards ensuring that financial markets operate transparently. Whether the legislation moves forward or not, it has sparked an important conversation about the role of elected officials in emerging financial markets. Ultimately, the battle over cryptocurrency regulation is far from over. As digital assets continue to evolve, lawmakers will need to balance market innovation with ethical governance, ensuring that no public figure can exploit their political influence for private financial gain.

With market trends evolving, investors are eyeing the best new crypto projects that bring innovation and real-world utility. Among the high potential crypto opportunities, DexBoss, Aureal One, and three other coins stand out as promising contenders. These top altcoin picks could offer significant returns. Let’s explore these projects. Top 5 Best Coins to Buy Now with High Growth Potential As the market of digital currencies keeps on expanding, it’s getting increasingly harder for investors to find such assets that have bright future. Projects like DexBoss ($DEBO) and Aureal One ($DLUME) are two that have shown themselves to be out of the ordinary in the scene. These funders don’t just allow their platforms to be used as a vehicle for the innovative ideas of their users but also have presales where gains for the investors are still within reach. Following are the five alternative cryptocurrencies that you ought to think about as an investment that will pave the way to a very promising future for the company: DexBoss ($DEBO) Aureal One ($DLUME) Polygon ($MATIC) Avalanche ($AVAX) Chainlink ($LINK) 1. DexBoss ($DEBO) The first token had the vision to exist on the two sides and the same as its traditional finance (DEFI) analog and thus, it makes a good way of fixing the long standing issues trading is facing. This presale is very well-crafted. The reason for this is the arrangements made that are designed to attract the required amount of $50 million which will allow early investors to purchase the token with prices that are going up slowly from $0.01. It is one of the numerous platforms with the most cryptocurrencies I have come across. Click here to know more about DexBoss This platform offers a lot of different major features such as liquidity farming and margin trading that are mainly used for trading ecosystems that are profitable. Also, the buyback-burn system will alter the value of the token with the use of $DEBO. This will happen since the supply of the tokens will have been reduced in time and the funds raised by this move will be invested properly. These fundamentals are good examples of the principle of the stock in the end. This is the current trend even though the outcomes realized are not as planned because a fairly low base is the primary reason for the downswing of the potential winnings. 2. Aureal One ($DLUME) Aureal One, the blockchain network is all that the young generation of today dreams about and it is only accessible to them in gaming and an alternate reality system. Aureal One is highly versed in trading with its flash transactions and low costs that make it possible for dealers to come up with a wide variety of new experiences. The way Aureal One is assisted with the project has been through the introduction of the selected in a form of a 21-rounds presale which is planned to have its budgeting round of $50 million. It is staking through Dlume. Users who are DLUME token holders can receive rewards and vote, consequently, involving the community. Following the rise of games like Clash of Tiles on these platforms offers them the right opportunity. Through this kind of exposure, the platforms get extra chances to promote their capabilities, and as a result, they become recognized in the gaming industry. 3. Polygon ($MATIC) The core reason for subtracting part of Polygon’s shift towards the reinforcement of Ethereum scalability is the fact that the vast majority of the audience from the most different parts of the globe are already set on it. The Ethereum-based apps in the world are scaling up, and as a result, the demand for quick and low-cost transactions is also rising so that MATIC will be the best option for this. Polygon has been defending its right through the unique ecosystem, which in its turn is the first issue that has to be held in mind with the new MATIC most-bed coins in 2024, Dark horse or all the others, you name it. 4. Avalanche ($AVAX) Every once in a while, fifteenth- theses Ballsom Arkorum is getting deep thoughts about the committee, however, he continues to crack jokes with its members…BSC referred to as sound-breaking-hour saver is expected to be Atherium-hardforks-ed. The next release will be a considerable step for the project. 5. Chainlink ($LINK) Chainlink acts as a bridge between the real world and blockchain system oracles, thus being analogical with decentralized oracles. The close relationship between the two, as they are the occurrence of smart contracts, which need to rely on real-world data for trust and accuracy feeds, is the fact for which smart contracts are driving. Their focus on these close data sources increases the number of reliable data feed providers thus making several of these more needing. Chainlink’s gradual enlargement of the number of links to other blockchains is really the main target, which does not preclude it from being a very tempting option for investors who demand medium and long-time investment plans. Final Conclusion: To sum up, the cryptocurrency space is an innovation hub and the probable growth that will result in due course is also a benefit, additionally, the new usage of these virtual coins in the market can also be seen. DexBoss ($DEBO) This invention has undoubtedly contributed to the wealth of most crypto players, notably those who supported it during the investor-oriented presale. Our essential goal is to break the traditional market structure by creating a platform that can be traded but do not have just primary features, in other words, where it also provides users with different functions such as liquidity farming and margin trading, thus, the platform is also easy to access for beginners. Further, while attaining such an understanding of the projects and deciding the future properly, the shareholders can advise soundly, which will pave the way to achieving the longed-for objectives and the taking of risks. Also, Aureal One ($DLUME) becomes one of the major coins that are being added to the list by applications known to the public or rather it is building the applications that shall be the prime ones for gaming and the metaverse, those enabling scalability to Ethereum, and real data feeds for blockchain systems. For most of the time, the evaluations of the most progressive cryptos should be on a rise due to their growth and evolution. The potential cryptocurrency investor in this way will be able to “move along with the tide” of the market and will be thus able to catch the various chances occurring at a time of the rise in the level of high-potential projects given that the investor uses accurate research and has a deep understanding of the current market trends.",Sponsored,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|MATIC|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-28 07:05:20

After locking the door and heading toward your car, you likely turned back abruptly to ensure the lock was secure before continuing your journey. Financial markets, led by a range of human emotions, exhibit similar behaviors. After a convincing move beyond a long-held resistance, assets typically return to confirm the validity of the breakout. That serves as a test of the strength of the former resistance-turned-support, following which bigger rallies unfold. The ""breakout and retest play"" phenomenon is well-known across asset classes. Bitcoin's (BTC) ongoing sell-off might be just that – a healthy retest of the breakout point or the former resistance-turned-support of $73,757 breached in November. In other words, the downward momentum could run out of steam at or closer to these levels, potentially setting the stage for a bigger run higher. BTC has dropped over 15% to under $80,000 this month, exposing the former resistance-turned-support at $73,757. Prices broke above that level in early November, ending months-long consolidation after pro-crypto Donald Trump won the U.S. Presidential election. The tendency of markets to retrace or revisit the breakout point before staging more enormous rallies has its roots in the behavioral aspects of investing. People are generally risk averse when it comes to securing gains. So, when facing profits, traders quickly book those instead of allowing the winning trade to run wild. The so-called prospect theory explains why post-breakout rallies abruptly run out of steam, often leading to a retest of the breakout point. BTC holders have been taking profits around the $100K mark since December. Now, as prices turn lower and near the breakout point, in this case, $73,757, market participants who missed the initial rally jump in, ensuring the level holds. The resulting bounce from the former resistance-turned-support draws in more and more buyers, potentially yielding a bigger rally. That's precisely what happened in the third quarter of 2023 and August-September 2020. On both occasions, the breakout and retest produced bigger rallies to new record highs. Traders, however, need to note that a failed retest or a lack of a meaningful bounce indicates underlying weakness that can evolve into a full blown downtrend. Over the years, I have seen numerous examples of retests of breakouts/breakdowns leading to bigger moves in traditional markets. Consider the yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond. It triggered a double-bottom breakout in January 2024 and revisited the breakout level multiple times before rising to multi-year highs. The AUD/USD pair dived out of a major support trendline in December, hinting at a deeper slide. The pair bounced to the trendline resistance early this month only to see sharp losses this week.",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-28 07:09:51

Ethereum Classic has long been a more affordable alternative to ETH. With Ether transitioning to a Proof-of-Stake model, those favoring Proof-of-Work networks could shift their interest to Ethereum Classic. Despite an increase in value in 2023, Ethereum Classic did not meet market expectations, signaling potential concerns. However, Ethereum Classic is not viewed as an unregistered security, which is positive for its market standing. As a result, ETC is a good investment option in the long term. Why is the ETC Price Down Today? Following the overall selling pressure in the market, ETC price is dropping toward $18. Will ETC Recover? If buyers defend the immediate support at $17, we might see a strong recovery toward $20. Will ETC Price Reach $100? ETC price might soon reach the $100 mark in 2028 if the buying demand continues to surge and Ethereum Classic attracts altcoin investors. Will ETC Price Reach $1000? Due to the effort of the Ethereum community, Ethereum Classic Coin’s prices will continue to increase. However, there is currently no indication that the Ethereum Classic (ETC) Coin will reach $1000 in the near future, which is a long-term target. Is ETC a Good Long-Term Investment? ETC has gained popularity thanks to strong community support. However, it’s crucial to conduct thorough research into their long-term potential to determine if it represents a viable long-term investment. Recent ETC News/Opinions Buterin recommended that individuals dissatisfied with Ethereum’s transition to Proof of Stake could use Ethereum Classic, which continues to utilize the Proof of Work consensus system. ETC Price Prediction March 2025 Over the last few days, ETC coin price has been on a downward trend and it aims to drop below crucial Fib levels. If the BTC price aims for a recovery above $90K in March, we might see a solid recovery in the ETC price. According to technical analysis, we might see the ETC price to record the maximum level of $25 and minimum price of $15, with an expected average trading price of $19 throughout March.

In a recent Binance Square vote, 86% of users supported listing Pi Coin on the exchange. This has excited Pi Network fans, who think a Binance listing could make the coin more trusted and push its price higher. 86% of Voters Support Pi Coin Listing On February 17, Binance launched a community survey to see if users wanted Pi Coin to be listed. The response was huge, with 86% of nearly 295,000 participants voting in favor. This strong support shows the growing interest in Pi Coin. Inspite of favorable voting results, Binance made it clear that the vote alone doesn’t guarantee a listing. However, Binance said the final choice to launch Pi Coin will go through a strict review. They further posted on Binance Square that, “We respect the vote results, but they are just for guidance. The decision depends on our official checks and standards.” Despite this, the high level of support has caught the crypto community’s attention. Pi Network’s Growing Popularity Since past few month Pi Network has gained significant popularity, largely due to its solution to Bitcoin’s major mining problem. It now has over 60 million active users and a strong social media presence, with 3.7 million followers on X making the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by following. Many believe that if Pi Coin gets listed on Binance, it will gain more exposure and attract more investors. How a Binance Listing Could Impact Pi Coin’s Price The excitement around a potential Binance listing comes at a time when Pi Coin’s price has dropped. As of now Pi coin has been trading around $2.4 reflecting a drop of 11% due to market crash. However, history has shown that when a cryptocurrency gets listed on Binance, it often experiences strong price movements. If Pi Coin is officially listed, it could gain more trust and see a rise in value. Pi Day Celebration On 14 March Meanwhile, Pi Network supporters are looking forward to Pi Day on March 14. This annual event celebrates the project’s launch, which happened on the same date in 2019. Many believe this year’s Pi Day could bring more updates about the coin’s future.",News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BNB|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-28 07:11:42

PEPE/USD chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, Pepe’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.00000724, beginning a bearish trend to $0.00000605. Is PEPE A Good Investment? Reviewing the Pepe project’s roadmap, it appears there are no detailed plans other than anticipation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate. Given this lack of clear direction and with an already sizable community of over 500,000 Twitter followers, the project’s price growth potential may be capped. However, meme coins have a reputation for offering significant returns, as their values can surge dramatically when supported by strong community movements. This was evident when Pepe’s value skyrocketed by over 222% to reach a new all-time high (ATH) following its listing on the Binance exchange. A similar significant announcement in 2025 could propel Pepe to surpass its previous ATH. Why is Pepe down today? Pepe’s price has declined over the last few hours as it faced intense selling pressure. The price is aiming for a hold below the $0.0000075 mark. Will Pepe price recover? If buyers strongly defend the $0.000007 mark, we might see a strong recovery above $0.00001. Will Pepe price reach $0.01? Pepe’s price might touch the $0.01 mark by the end of 2029. However, this price milestone entirely depends on the utility of Pepe coin and future buying demand. Will Pepe price reach $1? Pepe has a great community, and the hype is high for the meme coin. If everything remains good, we might see Pepe’s price touch $1 soon or by 2040. Recent news Tech billionaire Elon Musk stirred online buzz by renaming his X (formerly Twitter) profile to ‘Kekius Maximus’ and changing his profile picture to the ‘Pepe the Frog’ meme. PEPE Price Prediction February 2025 If BTC price records robust surges this month, we might see PEPE price skyrocketing. We expect the PEPE price to record minimum and maximum prices of $0.000009 and $0.000018, respectively. The average price might be around $0.000015. Month Potential low ($) Potential average ($) Potential high ($) February 2025 0.000009 0.000015 0.000018 Pepe price prediction 2025 The Pepe roadmap is somewhat vague, with few definitive plans beyond the expectation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate the market. This lack of clear direction might cap the project’s price potential, despite its robust community. Meme coins have a reputation for offering significant financial returns, as their values can surge rapidly when supported by their communities. The impact of major announcements was evident when Pepe’s value soared by more than 222% following its listing on the Binance exchange, reaching an all-time high. A similar event in 2025 could potentially send Pepe to new peaks. In 2025, Pepe’s minimum expected price is projected to be $0.000024. It may peak at a maximum value of $0.000035, with an average trading price of $0.000027 throughout the year.

For instance, Shiba Inu is developing Shibarium, a layer-two scaling solution on Ethereum , alongside various protocols and tools for its community. Meanwhile, Dogecoin is enhancing tools and libraries that facilitate the integration of $DOGE as a payment option for businesses.

Jake Claver, a prominent business leader and financial strategist, recently highlighted this development as a crucial step toward enhancing the flexibility and functionality of the XRPL. This advancement enables permissionless development while maintaining compliance, scalability, and security—key factors for institutional adoption. Unlike other blockchain networks that prioritized programmability from inception, XRPL has taken a structured approach by first optimizing specific use cases. This new feature set will build on the existing framework, allowing developers to create custom solutions for institutions without compromising efficiency. Major #XRP Ledger update – Native Programmability. This marks a huge step forward for flexible, permissionless development. It's significant for institutions to create custom solutions that are both compliant and scalable, without compromising on security or efficiency. 1/21 — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) February 25, 2025 The Evolution of XRPL’s Programmability Historically, XRPL has provided a robust financial infrastructure with built-in tools such as decentralized exchange (DEX) , escrow mechanisms, and tokenization features. These elements are vital for the integration of blockchain technology into traditional finance. However, until now, XRPL has not offered a native way for developers to introduce custom logic directly within its existing features. With the introduction of “Smart Features,” XRPL is evolving beyond its modular design to incorporate programmability in a way that enhances, rather than replaces, its existing framework. This means that core functionalities—such as escrows, automated market makers (AMMs), and tokens—can be customized to meet specific regulatory and operational needs. Developers will extend these features rather than create new ones from scratch, leveraging pre-audited code to enhance security and efficiency. Smart Escrows: The First Step One of the most anticipated enhancements is the introduction of Smart Escrows. Currently, XRPL’s escrow feature allows funds to be released only based on time constraints or password conditions. With Smart Escrows, developers can introduce more complex logic, enabling use cases such as Notary-based escrows, where funds can only be unlocked by specific accounts. Credential-based escrows, require the recipient to hold a specific non-fungible token (NFT) for access. Cascading escrows facilitate structured financial transactions real estate deals or options trading. The implementation of Smart Escrows will follow a phased rollout, beginning with an early development network (devnet) in Q1, progressing to a fully functional devnet in Q2, and moving toward an amendment voting process in Q3. By Q4, XRPL is expected to introduce a smart contract devnet, which will further expand its programmability. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Future of Smart Features and Smart Contracts Beyond Smart Escrows, the XRPL roadmap includes the expansion of programmability across various native features. Smart AMMs will allow for custom trading strategies, Smart Accounts will introduce additional security protections, and Smart Tokens will enable regulatory compliance for tokenized assets . Smart Batch transactions will incorporate logic trees, facilitating complex financial operations with streamlined execution. Importantly, XRPL’s Smart Features will complement traditional smart contracts rather than replace them. Developers will have the flexibility to leverage native building blocks when possible, while still having access to a full smart contract environment for more complex needs. These smart contracts, which will integrate Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-style logic with XRPL’s transaction model, will enable advanced decentralized finance (DeFi) applications such as derivatives, perpetual contracts, and staking rewards. Institutional Implications and Adoption The introduction of native programmability is a strategic move to attract institutional interest. Financial institutions require tailored blockchain solutions that balance efficiency, security, and compliance. XRPL’s approach—offering modular, customizable features—provides a compelling value proposition for businesses looking to integrate blockchain without the risks associated with untested smart contract environments. Additionally, while the XRPL EVM sidechain remains relevant for Ethereum developers, the ability to build directly on the core XRPL network offers greater security and efficiency. This advancement positions XRPL as a viable platform for institutional-grade blockchain applications, strengthening its role in the broader financial ecosystem. As the phased rollout progresses throughout 2025, the impact of these changes is expected to drive increased development activity and broader institutional engagement in the XRPL ecosystem.

Ethereum (ETH) The market turned bearish and Ethereum has lost its support at $2,400, falling by 21% in the past seven days. This market-wide drop impacted almost all cryptocurrencies with most in double digit losses in the past week. In the case of ETH, it is critical that the price remains above $2,000 as a key psychological level. If lost, then Ethereum will have good support around $1,800, a level not seen since 2023 when crypto was in a bear market. Looking ahead, Ethereum is quickly approaching a moment where its bullish uptrend is invalidated. A price under $2,000 would push it in a bear market with lower levels likely after that. Chart by Tradingview Ripple ( XRP ) XRP did its best to remain bullish, but the overall market pushed its price back to $2 at the time of this post. While this support level appears strong, continued selling would eventually break it and that could quickly see the price fall much lower. This cryptocurrency also had a difficult week, closing it with a 23% loss. If nothing changes in the coming days, then the next key support level is found at $1.6. Looking ahead, if the price falls under $2, then the rally is over, and the top was likely already made at $3.4 back in January 2025. While it is still early to call it, the signs remain bearish based on this price action. Chart by Tradingview Cardano (ADA) ADA lost its key support at $0.64 and closes the week with a 25% price drop. This is extremely concerning since the price could fall to $0.45 next. Such a price would return ADA to bear market levels. Sellers are dominating, and if buyers don’t return soon to bring ADA back above $0.64, then lower price levels should be expected as the downtrend continues. Looking ahead, ADA does not have the power to stop sellers at this time. Watch the key support at $0.45 since that level could bring back buyers if they don’t show up earlier. Chart by Tradingview Binance Coin (BNB) Binance Coin tried to stay above $600, but buyers were unable to defend that level after a massive sell pressure in the past 24h. With this support lost, the asset fell by 12% in the past week. If BNB continues to go lower, buyers could reappear between $550 and $500. Strong support at $500 has held well in the past when sellers spiked the price. Looking ahead, this cryptocurrency shows more strength than most altcoins, considering it has not made a lower low yet. The price consolidates into a flat range above $500, and as long as that level holds, BNB can recover later. Chart by Tradingview Solana (SOL) Solana had one of its worst weeks since 2024. The price appears in a free fall and registered a 27% loss in the past seven days. With the support at $134 gone, SOL may soon approach $100 at this rate. It is critical to maintain a three-digit price since this is a psychological level. At the same time, any price closing on $100 is likely to attract new buyers since that level is also a key support. Looking ahead, Solana must do its best to not drop under $100 as that would put an end to its uptrend. The next few days and weeks are decisive.

This week’s expiry event is larger than usual because it is the end of the month. However, the impact on spot markets is likely to be minimal as they’re already reeling from US President Trump’s trade war. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s big batch of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 0.71, meaning that there are slightly more call (long) contracts expiring than puts (shorts). Moreover, open interest (OI), or the value or number of BTC options contracts yet to expire, still remains highest at the $120,000 strike price, which is $1.5 billion, according to Deribit. There is also around $1 billion in OI at the $100,000 and $110,000 strike prices. Bearish sentiment is also seeping back as $800,000 in OI currently sits at the $80,000 strike price, which is where the asset stands now. Crypto derivatives provider Greeks Live said the team was “predominantly bearish,” with traders watching $82,000 as a “critical support level that must hold to maintain the high timeframe trend.” However, that line has been broken to the downside as of press time. “There’s significant concern about continued downside, with many members discussing the rapid 17% decline over three days and debating whether recent selling is controlled or indicative of a broader market shift.” Bitcoin OI by expiry. Source: Deribit Technical analysis suggests if the price closes below the 2024 volume weighted average price (VWAP) bands, “the higher timeframe trend would be ‘cooked’ and could lead to $77,000 to $72,000 levels,” warned Greeks. Around 526,000 Ethereum contracts are also expiring today, with a notional value of $1.14 billion and a put/call ratio of 0.52. This brings Friday’s combined crypto options expiry notional value to around $5.8 billion. Crypto Markets Tank This week’s market rout has continued into Friday, with total capitalization dumping a further 6% on the day to $2.76 trillion. It has now fallen through longer-term support and could return to October levels. Bitcoin dumped 5% in a fall to $80,200 during Asian trading on Friday morning. The asset has now lost 18% in a week, and its correction has deepened to 25% from all-time highs. The last time BTC was below $80,000 was on Nov. 10. Meanwhile, Ethereum has dumped 8% to its lowest level for more than a year, hitting $2,150 on Friday morning as its weekly losses amount to a whopping 22%. The altcoins were a sea of red with them all bleeding out by similar amounts at the time of writing.

The decline comes despite US regulators declaring that meme coins are collectibles and not subject to securities laws. However, despite the regulatory clarity, the crypto market is facing one of its worst selloffs in history. Can DOGE price recover or is there a risk of further downside to $0.10? DOGE trades at $0.185 at press time, with a staggering 10% drop in 24 hours. Dogecoin Price Hits 4-Month Low as SEC Deems Meme Coins Non-Securities Dogecoin price trades at its lowest level in nearly four months after the price dropped by 26% in just seven days. The downtrend continues to extend despite the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) declaring that meme coins are not securities . According to the SEC, meme coin trading does involve the offer and sale of securities as outlined in the federal securities laws. However, meme coin purchasers are not protected under securities laws. This statement has increased the odds of a Dogecoin ETF approval. According to Polymarket, the odds of a DOGE ETF being approved by the end of July 31 have soared to record highs. An approval could spark DOGE price rally to $1. Dogecoin ETF Approval Nonetheless, these factors are not enough for a bullish Dogecoin price prediction . Instead, DOGE holders continue to suffer losses. DOGE Holders Face Massive Losses as MVRV Dips The decline in Dogecoin price has placed many DOGE holders in losses, as shown by the 30-day Market value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. This ratio is deeply negative, suggesting that Dogecoin traders are facing unrealized losses of 20%. A significant dip in the MVRV ratio often hints at a buying opportunity that may precede a Dogecoin price rebound. However, if these losses continue, it may dampen the market sentiment for the meme coin in the near term, leading to further losses. Dogecoin 30-Day MVRV Ratio Unless more traders buy the dip and show confidence in a recovery, and buyers overpower panic sellers, DOGE price still faces headwinds. Can Dogecoin Price Drop to $0.10? Dogecoin price is facing the risk of further downside that could push the meme coin to $0.10. On the daily chart, the RSI has dropped to record lows of 23, indicating a brutal sell-off that is causing the bearish trend. The last time that the DOGE RSI was this oversold was in March 2023 when Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Banks collapsed causing panic in the crypto market. Despite this oversold RSI, the crypto market is still in a state of fear, diminishing the likelihood of a DOGE price recovery. As selling pressure grows, Dogecoin price will likely drop to $0.12 in the near term. If it loses this support level, Dogecoin could plunge to $0.0085. DOGE/USDT: 1-day Chart Is a Recovery Ahead? Dogecoin price remains under bearish stress, which weakens any chances of a recovery in the near term. The widespread market crash has intensified panic selling, which will accelerate the price decline for altcoins like DOGE. Therefore, a recovery for DOGE price is not likely to happen in the near term unless the sentiment in the broader market shifts to positive and buying pressure replaces selling activity.

On Feb. 27, the commission’s Division of Corporation Finance addressed a long-standing debate over whether cryptocurrencies—particularly memecoins—fall under federal securities laws. The current SEC views memecoins as more like collectibles than investments and claims they don’t meet the definition of a security under the Howey test . “Memecoins typically are purchased for entertainment, social interaction, and cultural purposes, and their value is driven primarily by market demand and speculation. In this regard, memecoins are akin to collectibles,” SEC officials wrote in a recent staff statement. According to the commission, meme coins aren’t part of a larger enterprise. There’s no central team pooling funds to develop a business, and buyers aren’t investing in a structured project expecting long-term growth. It added that memecoins derive their price movements from “market demand and speculation” rather than the “entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.” Since their value is tied to hype and collective sentiment—much like collectibles—the agency said they fail to meet the Howey test’s criteria for an investment contract. “Persons who participate in the offer and sale of meme coins do not need to register their transactions with the Commission,” the SEC said, but added that fraudulent activity wouldn’t go unnoticed. You might also like: SEC and MetaMask creator Consensys agree to end lawsuit The agency warned that scams involving memecoins could still face enforcement from other federal or state regulators. While the tokens themselves may not be securities, misleading investors or engaging in deceptive practices could still land projects in legal trouble. It also stressed that the statement only applies to meme coins that fit its description, and tokens disguised as memecoins to sidestep securities laws could also be subject to regulation, depending on their structure and purpose. However, the agency noted that its views aren’t a “rule, regulation, guidance, or statement” of the SEC itself. Instead, it described the statement as a staff interpretation with “no legal force or effect.” The commission aims to provide “greater clarity on the application of the federal securities laws to crypto assets” with its statement but made it clear that the classification of meme coins could still depend on “the economic realities of the particular transaction.” Currently spearheaded by a pro-crypto leadership , the SEC’s statement marks a significant shift from the regulator’s previous stance under former chair Gary Gensler, who mostly viewed all cryptocurrencies, except Bitcoin , as securities. During Gensler’s tenure, the SEC pursued legal actions against major crypto entities, including Coinbase and Ripple Labs. Notably, the lawsuit against Ripple Labs, initiated in 2020, became a benchmark case in this regard. A 2023 ruling found that XRP’s programmatic sales didn’t violate securities laws , but the SEC appealed the decision.

Of course, Saylor has been joking in a light mood as Bitcoin price crashes under $80,000 earlier today, while requesting investors to hold with diamond hands. On the other hand, Saylor has been actively in discussions with lawmakers for implementing a BTC strategic reserve for the United States. Michael Saylor Wants Bitcoin Investors to Hold With Diamond Hands The Bitcoin price crash under $80,000 today has sent tremors across the larger crypto market. With this, BTC has extended its weekly losses to more than 18% as the crypto market grapples through major liquidity crisis, macro uncertainty, Donald Trump’s trade war tariffs and much more. Responding to the current developments, Michael Saylor wrote: “Sell a kidney if you must, but keep the Bitcoin”. The strategy executive chairman has been an ardent supporter of BTC and has pledged to never sell his Bitcoins anytime in the future. Several corporate players like Metaplanet , Semler Scientific, etc. have adopted Saylor’s Bitcoin playbook thereby managing to build immense wealth for their shareholders. Saylor’s comment of selling a kidney saw mixed reactions from the Bitcoin community. While some took this as a joke, others took a jibe at him for his forever Bitcoin bulls predictions. One of the followers named Geoffrey said: “maybe you should have thought of that when you were buying 97k and not saving your powder for a dip”. A further 16% drop in Bitcoin’s price could push MicroStrategy into a total loss on its Bitcoin holdings, in addition to its $8 billion debt burden. Critics argue that Saylor’s decision to heavily invest at market highs may have been overly aggressive. Recent reports also suggested that Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings would be at risk if the MSTR stock falls even further. Saylor Discusses Bitcoin Strategic Reserve for US Earlier this week, on Tuesday, Michael Saylor met with the House Financial Services Committee and Representative French Hill to discuss building Bitcoin Strategic reserves for the United States. Saylor emphasized the importance of positioning the U.S. as a global leader incryptocurrency innovation. The meeting focused on fostering a regulatory environment that supports the growth and adoption of blockchain technologies while ensuring financial stability. Congressman Dan Meuser hosted the meeting with Saylor noting: “Digital assets can unlock a frictionless payment future and enable new sources of access to capital. I look forward to the work the Financial Services Committee will do in crafting a commonsense legislative framework to provide clear rules of the road, fulfilling President Trump’s promise to make the U.S. the crypto capital of the world.” Pitching BTC to Jeff Bezos Earlier this week, Michael Saylor also pitched Bitcoin to billionaire Jeff Bezos. Bezos, who owns the Washington Post, said that the publication will undergo major changes for its opinions section while promoting “free markets” and “personal liberties”. Responding to this, Saylor wrote: “Bitcoin is the best way to promote personal liberties and free markets. It offers an open protocol for prosperity that can be delivered to everyone via digital technology”. Bitcoin price has faced a sharp correction in recent market turmoil and is down another 6% today trading at $80,290 as of press time.

Japan retail sales rise the most in 11 months; industrial output falls for 3rd month Data released on Friday showed that Tokyo’s core inflation, a leading indicator of nationwide price trends, slowed to 2.2% in February from 2.5% in January. Japan's housing starts declined by 4.6% year-over-year in January 2024, worsening from a 2.5% drop in the previous month and surpassing market forecasts of a 2.6% fall. China ( SHCOMP ) fell 1.94% to below 3,370 while the Shenzhen Component dropped 1% to 10,820 on Friday, with both benchmarks set to end the week lower. The offshore yuan decline around 7.29 per dollar, triggered by US President Donald Trump's announcement of an additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports.

India ( SENSEX ) fell 1.43% to 73,696 in morning trade on Friday, after being flat the prior day, hitting its lowest level since early June 2024. Traders were cautious ahead of the release of GDP data later today, with the market expecting the GDP to grow at 6.3%, still lower than the RBI's estimate of 6.8%. Australia ( AS51 ) fell 1.16% to close at 8,172 on Friday, reaching its lowest point in nearly two months. The Australian dollar depreciated past $0.623 on Friday and was on track to decline over 2% for the week. Domestically, data revealed that private credit growth in Australia fell short of expectations in January, with both household and business credit showing signs of slowdown. In the U.S., on Thursday, all three major indexes ended in red dragged down by a selloff in tech stocks, as investors weighed Nvidia’s earnings, trade policy uncertainty, and economic data. U.S. stock futures stabilized on Friday as investors braced for the upcoming Personal Consumption Expenditures price index report, the Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge of inflation: Dow -0.02%; S&P 500 +0.10%; Nasdaq +0.05%. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) continued its decline toward $80,000 on Friday and is now down about 25% from all-time highs as the selloff in cryptocurrencies deepened, reversing gains made following the election victory of US President Donald Trump.

The filing, submitted on February 25 to the Delaware Division of Corporations, signals the company’s intention to introduce a spot ETF centered on the layer-1 cryptocurrency Aptos. While this move does not guarantee immediate approval, it is an important part of the regulatory process. A Blockchain Researcher wrote on X, “According to official documents, the BITWISE APTOS ETF has been registered in Delaware, USA! Earlier, several APTOS ETPs were launched in Europe, including Bitwise Aptos Staking ETP and 21Shares Aptos Staking ETP.” The next crucial phase involves submitting a formal application to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This application will include a comprehensive prospectus detailing the ETF’s structure, investment strategy, and how it plans to track the performance of the Aptos blockchain. This filing comes at a time when regulatory sentiment toward cryptocurrency is shifting, especially under new leadership. The news of the filing has had an impressive effect on the price of Aptos (APT), which surged by 12% following the announcement. APT hit a high of $6.31 in the last 24 hours before hitting a reverse. The token, along with Bitcoin and other coins, is currently experiencing a bearish dip. Bitwise has already made waves in the crypto ETF market, having filed for several crypto-related ETFs in the past, including a push for the XRP ETF.

The attackers used a malicious meeting app “that installs information-stealing malware to steal cryptocurrency wallets.” The attack was initially flagged by several impacted users on Telegram , helping affected users to navigate through the loss. The malware is designed to infect both Mac and Windows devices. GrassCall’s Social Engineering Tactics Choy Kwok, a web3 professional, posted on X early this week, warning followers about the scam. He cautioned users not to download any meeting app that was asked by recruiters pretending to be from Chain Seeker. Another Monday, another scam This time it is @ChainSeeker_io Setting up time to speak with them will take you to @GrassCall Do not download anything! https://t.co/Tl8CtkKzA5 pic.twitter.com/4nDXRvDRjk — Choy (@choykwok) February 24, 2025 Crypto Jobs List, a web3 job portal, carried several job listings for a blockchain-based platform ‘ChainSeeker.io’. However, little did the applicants know that perpetrators were behind the job scam. The jobs were also listed on LinkedIn and X, from legitimate-looking fake profiles. “Setting up time to speak with them will take you to GrassCall. Do not download anything,” Kwok wrote. Aspirants who applied for jobs via the portal, were reportedly asked to reach out to the company’s Chief Marketing Officer via Telegram to coordinate the meeting. Source: Choy, via Bleeping Computer They were then asked to download a video meeting software GrassCall, with a website link and call code. The website “grasscall[.]net” led to a download link that described GrassCall as a “revolutionary AI solution in the field of communications.” Source: Bleeping Computer Atomic Stealer Malware Drains Cryptos From Victim Wallets According to a cybersecurity researcher g0njxa, GrassCall website is a clone of a “Gatherum” website , which was used by the same Russian group in previous campaigns. The GrassCall app prompts to enter a code shared by the fake CMO, and installs remote access trojans (RATs). The RAT then installs the Atomic (AMOS) Stealer malware on Macs. “The rat is used to create persistence in the machine, add a keylogger for password too and deploying seed phishing for the hard wallets,” G0njxa told Bleeping Computer. Once the malware takes control of the computer, it attempts to steal files based on keywords, cryptocurrency wallets, and passwords. If a crypto wallet is found with the extracted password, the assets in the wallet are drained, he explained. This comes parallelly with the recent widespread malware campaign targeting users on GitHub , flagged by cybersecurity firm Kaspersky.

Chart 1 – Analyzed by Buvaneswari_L, published on TradingView, Feb 27, 2025 Crono (CRO) Uptime & Best Cryptocurrency to Buy Now Based on the Cronos price analysis, it is evident that CRO price movement is struggling to break the key resistance. With the market trend shifting, investors and crypto enthusiasts are looking for the next crypto to hit $1 that offers exponential gains in the upcoming bull run. Aureal One, DexBoss, and the other three coins are competing to lead their spot in the marketplace. Let’s explore their unique attributes in detail. Best 5 Cryptocurrencies to Buy Now AurealOne DexBoss Bitcoin Ethereum Binance Coin We all know that modern cryptocurrency trading has given tomorrow’s opportunities to the smartest people. The right news of this time is the issue of cryptocurrency skyrocket also Aureal One (DLUME) Enter the realm of the future through Aureal One, a state-of-the-art blockchain platform that magnifies the potential of game and metaverse activities. By including features like blazingly fast transactions and employing minimal transaction costs, Aureal One makes the development process simpler for both developers and the users, respectively. Besides, the DLUME token, which is based on Ethereum, is considered a more familiar and convenient platform for transactions in the ecosystem. Click here to know more about Aureal One Personally, I like it that the company has its own virtual world called DarkLume, where all these cutting-edge technologies can be implemented. The later part of the sentence means; by creating a platform where global developers are interconnected, we provide you with true digital ownership. The decentralized world of DarkLume, where people can buy, sell, and create projects, belongs to them. They can earn money from the modifications and build their kingdom of city beauty together. By now, it is reported by the developers that they have successfully reached 72% of the target amount which equals to $3.2 million. The tokens are sold for $0.0013 during the presale. After it is listed at $0.005, the price is expected to increase. Those who are interested in the tokens at the presale can do the staking through a decentralized wallet, depositing cryptos such as ETH, BNB, and then connecting it to the Aureal One presale webpage. 2. DexBoss (DEBO) A new decentralized cryptocurrency exchange platform DexBoss wants to alter the ecosystem of DeFi with the implementation of an increased leverage trading and low fees. With the support of more than 2000 cryptos, DexBoss is the source of liquidity and the medium of exchange, which was globally acceptable by people at any level. Powered by an advanced idea of the trading terminal, the AI-driven charts and executing orders will allow traders to conduct all possible trading activities in the fastest and the most effective manner. DexBoss is dedicated to the notions of community participation, empowerment, and governance. Token holders are given a chance to be part of the decision-making process and indirectly request the platform’s leadership team either to develop or to direct the project further. It is through this democratic capacity that there is a feeling of being the indirect cause of the policy hence, the users are persuaded to use the platform in tandem with the growth of the community. The presale of DexBoss reached its 79% milestone, with $588,000 out of the planned $750,000 being raised. The current price of presale is $0.011, and the price listed is $0.0505, the growth of this could lead to potential appreciation. The potential DEBO investors are not only able to purchase directly from the DEBO project via supported cryptocurrencies such as ETH, BNB, ARB but they can also use their credit card for the payment. The possible payment methods on the platform include: Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Solana, Tron, and Arbitrum networks. 3. Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin still leaves all its competitors significantly behind being in the first place in the market. As of February 27, 2025, Bitcoin is trading at $86,278 which is 1.74% lower than the previous close. The decrease is a consequence of the disorganization of the government, to come forward, in supporting the regulatory issues around the crypto sphere. Nevertheless, the industry insiders such as Cathie Wood, ARK Investment Management’s CEO, believe that the main driver of Bitcoin’s institutional adoption is still to come, hence more major money may be attracted to the stimulus of digital currency. 4. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is distinguished owing to its smart contract automation and a broad decentralized applications ecosystem. On February 27th, 2025, Ethereum’s price stands at $2,344.65, recording a drop of 3.51% from the previous session. Ethereum comes with a decentralized platform that has seen it attract developers and investors that love the selling point of its flexibility and at the same time, enjoy the ongoing updates with the aim of enhancing scalability and reducing the transaction cost. 5. Binance Coin (BNB) Binance Coin is a digital token that Binance exchange designed which is rated as the world’s largest crypto exchange based on its market. As per February 27, 2025, BNB is placed at $610.18, meaning it has declined by 1.26% since the previous close. The underlying strength and much more work that the popular crypto’s valuation comes from are its use within the Binance ecosystem such as the lower trading fees and opportunities to partake in token sales on the Binance Launchpad. The continuous widening of Binance’s pools of services and user database is the major contributors to BNB’s increase in that a high user base and demand are created which are the tokens’ growth factors. Final Thoughts The current state of the cryptocurrency market is still subject to great changes with both short-term and long-term investments being available there. Aureal One (DLUME) and DexBoss (DEBO) are the major assurance among their respective markets with their increasing pre-sale and growth possibilities. On the other hand, how existing players such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Binance Coin (BNB) keep being the leaders has made them victorious in gaining a lot of trader’s support, corporate’s investments, and the like as well as function.

Web3Bay ($3bay): Decentralized E-Commerce Marketplace The use of a transparent and decentralized e-commerce platform without any intermediary can be a good example of it, such as with Web3Bay. Online shopping platforms are typically full of problems, which is why middlemen are here to manage transactions. Web3Bay wants to change that.

AurealOne deals in the metaverse and gaming field by offering high-speed, low-cost blockchain infrastructure that is suitable for investment in the prospective virtual economies. The result of the presale further confirms that investors are indeed confident about the system. Conversely, DexBoss is an excellent blockchain-based startup that is streamlining DeFi by providing a platform which is very convenient to the users to trade tokens, stake, and yield farm. Thru its support for over 2,000 cryptocurrencies, DexBoss is easier for charitable traders and the newbies to join in.

Nevertheless, potential investors must do their homework, weigh associated risks, and pave the way for the diversification of their portfolios. Although ICOs can bring in very high profits they are also quite volatile. Only by deeply understanding the market trends, and thoughtfully investing in well-defined projects like AurealOne and DexBoss, can investors make money in the fast-growing blockchain sector.

While BTC fell by 7.7% in the last 24 hours to $79,000, Ethereum (ETH) fell to $2,100. With the declines, the Fear and Greed Index, which measures the sentiment among Bitcoin and cryptocurrency investors, fell to the level of extreme fear, and questions began to be asked among investors: “Is the bull run over? Has the bear run begun?” Related News: Extreme Fear Dominates Bitcoin and Altcoins! Should We Buy Fear? What Do Historical Data and Analysts Say? At this point, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, who stated in his previous posts that the bull market is not over and that it is too early to worry, updated his predictions after the last decline. CryptoQuant CEO X stated in his post that the BTC bull cycle will continue as long as it does not fall below $ 75,000, and that the critical level in the bull-bear cycle is $ 75,000. The famous CEO argued that the bullish expectation for Bitcoin continues and that a 30% decline is normal and healthy in bull cycles, and that the current bull cycle is not over. Ju said that if BTC drops significantly below $75,000, the bull cycle may be over. “I am a bull. The bull cycle is not over. 30% drops are normal in a bull cycle. If Bitcoin price drops significantly below $75k at this point, I would be wrong. I have not changed my stance; I have been consistent about the bull cycle and the 30% probability of a correction.” Ju lastly stated that he expects BTC to consolidate in a wide range such as $75,000 to $100,000 as in early 2024, and predicted that the rise will begin if positive news attracts new liquidity. Watch Out for the Weekend in Bitcoin! BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes warned investors that they are expecting a further decline in Bitcoin in the short term. Stating that BTC will experience a sharper decline this weekend, Hayes stated that the price will fall below $80,000. Arthur Hayes said that Bitcoin remains in a downtrend and is making lower lows. “We are making lower lows in this current wave of declines. I was risk-averse this morning, but looking at Bitcoin's price action, I think there will be another big wave below $80,000. That drop will most likely happen this weekend!” Hayes also predicted in his post a few days ago that BTC could fall to the $70,000 to $75,000 range if US President Donald Trump does not take positive steps. *This is not investment advice.

The high selling pressure has pushed the flagship cryptocurrency to oversold levels it had not seen since August 2024. Bitcoin Is Oversold, Time To Buy? According to an X post by seasoned crypto analyst Ali Martinez, BTC has entered oversold conditions it hadn’t seen since August 2024. Specifically, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for Bitcoin has dropped to the lowest level in the last seven months. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Showing Early Signs Of Bullish Divergence? Analyst Explains For the uninitiated, the RSI measures Bitcoin’s momentum on a scale of 0-100, with values above 70 signaling overbought conditions and below 30 indicating oversold levels. According to the following chart, BTC’s RSI has tumbled below 30, indicating the digital asset may be significantly oversold. Notably, the last time BTC was this oversold – in August 2024 – it led to a 33% price surge, pushing the digital asset from $49,000 to $64,000 in two weeks. A similar trajectory today could propel BTC to around $110,000. Acclaimed crypto investor The Wolf Of All Streets had similar thoughts on Bitcoin’s RSI. The investor shared the following 4-hour chart, saying: Bullish divergence with oversold RSI still very much in play. At the moment, RSI still is making a higher low. We need to see a clear “elbow up” on the next candle to confirm. Nothing here yet. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Rekt Capital predicts that there may be further downside for BTC. The analyst emphasized that BTC is getting closer to filling the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) gap between $78,000 to $80,700, which was created in November 2024. For the uninformed, a CME gap refers to the price difference between Bitcoin’s last traded price on the CME before the weekend and its price when the market reopens. Bitcoin is often believed to fill these gaps as part of a natural market correction, with the gap acting as a level of price support or resistance. Mixed Opinion On BTC Price Action The recent crypto market pullback has led to split opinions among analysts. For instance, a former Glassnode analyst recently said that the odds of being in a bear market are “not large.” Related Reading: Bitcoin 4-Year CAGR Drops To 14.45% But Still Outshines Gold, Stocks – Details Similarly, recent analysis by Andre Dragosch, European Head of Research at Bitwise, indicates that BTC may be undervalued at current market prices. On the contrary, Standard Chartered predicts that there may be another 10% drop in BTC price. Although the opinion on Bitcoin’s short-term price action may be divided, the long-term bullish case for the digital asset remains intact. At press time, BTC trades at $84,963, down 2.4% in the past 24 hours.

However, experts like Jeremy Hogan believe the Ripple vs SEC case’s complexity will lead to delays, predicting a conclusion no earlier than March 14. Notably, Hogan is maintaining his delay forecast for the XRP lawsuit, undeterred by the SEC’s recent decision to end the Tron lawsuit. Let’s unravel the lawyer’s predictions and analyze the Tron lawsuit’s potential implications on the Ripple case. When Will XRP Lawsuit End? Lawyer Answers Following the regulator’s move to pause the Tron lawsuit, the community is now wondering if the XRP lawsuit might be next in line for resolution. In response to the increasing speculations, legal expert Jeremy Hogan shared an X post . He reaffirmed his earlier prediction of a potential delay in the XRP lawsuit. “Ripple is STILL a more complicated a case to resolve because of the judgment,” stated Hogan, highlighting the higher possibility in the Ripple case’s delay. In addition, Hogan identified three key dates – March 14, April 11, and May 1 – as potential milestones for the settlement of the XRP lawsuit. According to Hogan, the Ripple vs SEC case may be settled on one of these three crucial dates. SEC’s Crypto Lawsuits and Ripple’s Future Significantly, the SEC has been making revolutionary moves over the past few days, concluding long-standing crypto lawsuits. Many high profile cases including Coinbase, Robinhood, OpenSea, and Uniswap have been closed by the restructured SEC under President Donald Trump. And most recently, the agency decided to pause the civil fraud case against Justin Sun, the founder of Tron Foundation. While many remain optimistic about the imminent XRP lawsuit settlement, lawyers like Hogan and MetaLawMan highlight the unlikely situation . According to them, Judge Analisa Torres’ ruling and the $125 million penalty remain significant obstacles to an earlier resolution. Not everyone is optimistic about the SEC’s recent actions. Former official John Reed Stark has leveled criticism against these moves. Stark believes that these regulatory reforms are a harbinger of the agency’s downfall, rather than a positive development. Three Likely Outcomes for Ripple vs SEC Case As pointed out by Protos, the Ripple vs SEC case has three most likely outcomes including affirmation, cross-appeals settlement, and reversal of Judge Torres’ decision. Statistically, affirming Judge Torres’ ruling is the most probable outcome of the XRP lawsuit. Aligning with the common practice of US appellate courts affirming lower court rulings, the Second Circuit will likely uphold Judge Torres’ decision. Next on the line is the lawsuit’s probable settlement. The SEC’s progressive approach and Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance reinforce the possibility of a settlement. With the SEC dismissing multiple crypto lawsuits, hopes for a Ripple case settlement are rising. The third most likely outcome of the SEC vs Ripple case is a reversal of Judge Torres’ decision. Interestingly, this would result in a decisive victory for the SEC. The judge ruled that programmatic sales of XRP aren’t securities and that Ripple’s exchange of XRP for non-cash services and labor was legitimate. If the appeals court reverses either of these decisions, it could lead to the XRP lawsuit’s ultimate outcome.

With Bitcoin options valued at $4.68 billion and Ethereum at $1.11 billion, traders are closely watching the put-to-call ratios and maximum pain points. For Bitcoin, the max pain point is far above its current market price, which may encourage options sellers to push prices higher as the expiration nears. Ethereum’s situation is similar, with its max pain point significantly higher than its market value, potentially leading to similar upward pressure. The approaching expiration is expected to bring heightened volatility, with many traders adopting defensive strategies such as call ratio spreads. This is due to the belief that Bitcoin could experience choppy price action and may retest lower levels before moving in any clear direction. The fear of continued downside is palpable, with market sentiment largely bearish, especially after a significant decline over the past few days. With institutional traders primarily focusing on monthly expiries, the potential for greater liquidity and tighter spreads suggests that this event could have a major impact on Bitcoin and Ethereum prices. In addition, with the expiration coming at the end of the month, it is expected that market makers will attempt to push the prices closer to the max pain levels, given the cluster of open interest. The market’s response to today’s expiry could offer valuable insights into how Bitcoin and Ethereum will behave in the short term, potentially setting the stage for a volatile period ahead. Overall, traders are preparing for heightened market movements as the expiration of these major options contracts could significantly influence the price direction of both Bitcoin and Ethereum , potentially pushing prices toward the max pain levels.",,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|ETH|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-28 08:03:05

Martinez tells his 128,800 followers on the social media platform X that a bearish divergence is evident on Bitcoin’s weekly time frame. A bearish divergence occurs when price is recording higher highs and higher lows while an indicator such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is recording lower lows and lower highs. The RSI indicator is a momentum oscillator used to determine oversold or overbought conditions. According to Martinez, Bitcoin had a similar divergence in November of 2021 prior to the bear market that followed and which saw BTC fall from the then-record high of around $69,000 to a cycle low of about $15,500 a year later. Source: Ali Martinez/X Over the short term, Martinez says Bitcoin lacks “significant support” below the $93,198 price and $70,440. Source: Ali Martinez/X The crypto trader further says that if the current Bitcoin cycle mirrors that of the first-halving cycle which ran from 2011 to 2015, it could be an indication that the crypto king topped out at $108,800 and is primed for further correction. Source: Ali Martinez/X If Bitcoin’s price action mirrors that of the second-halving cycle, Martinez says , “If Bitcoin follows the 2015-2018 cycle, this could suggest much more room to grow before the market top!” Source: Ali Martinez/X Bitcoin is trading at $85,822 at time of writing, down by about 21% from the all-time high reached on January 20th.

Consensys' CEO, Joseph Lubin, welcomed the decision and praised the SEC's new leadership, calling their approach “pro-innovation” and “pro-investor.” This marks the sixth case the SEC has dropped against crypto firms this week, signaling a shift in its enforcement strategy. Despite this, the SEC remains silent on its most high-profile case—its lawsuit against Ripple. Consensys, the company behind MetaMask, faced a lawsuit after the SEC raised concerns about whether its wallet violated securities laws. Lubin, however, expressed his satisfaction with the outcome, stating that Consensys and the SEC had reached an agreement in principle to dismiss the case. Once the Commission formally approves it, the case will be closed. This positive resolution highlights the SEC’s changing attitude toward crypto companies under its new leadership. Lubin also acknowledged that the SEC’s shift in focus was beneficial for both innovation and investor protection. While the SEC’s decision to drop its action against Consensys is welcomed by many in the industry, it raises questions about the future of the Ripple lawsuit , which has been ongoing for over three years. As one of the most significant enforcement actions under SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, the Ripple case has been a focal point of crypto regulation debates. Recently, the SEC tried to stall progress in the case, but there has been little public information since. This has left the crypto community speculating about whether the Commission will ultimately drop its case against Ripple. Recently, the SEC held a closed-door meeting that sparked further speculation about the fate of the Ripple case. According to the agenda, the meeting focused on resolving litigation claims, and discussions about examinations and enforcement proceedings were part of the talks. This has led some to believe that the SEC could be moving toward wrapping up its active investigations and lawsuits related to the crypto industry. The community remains eager to learn more , especially regarding Ripple, as the SEC has not provided concrete updates. Despite the uncertainty surrounding the Ripple case, some analysts believe that, given the recent trends, the SEC may continue to settle or drop actions against crypto firms. The SEC has already closed its investigations into several major players, including Gemini, and it’s becoming increasingly clear that the regulatory landscape is shifting. The XRP community remains hopeful that the Commission may soon decide to settle or dismiss its case against Ripple, but for now, there are no clear signs that this will happen soon. In the meantime, while the SEC and Consensys have reached a resolution, the focus of the crypto world remains on Ripple and its ongoing battle with the SEC. The industry is watching closely, hoping for a shift in the Commission’s stance. The growing trend of the SEC dropping lawsuits and shifting its focus suggests that the days of aggressive enforcement against crypto firms may be numbered. With the end of the month approaching, there may be more developments in the ongoing saga of crypto regulation. It seems that, for now, the question is not if the SEC will drop the Ripple case, but when .",,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-28 08:05:46

The fresh tariffs on China and probably the UK have created huge uncertainty not only among the market participants but also within the institutions. As a result, institutions like Blackrock have been liquidating billions worth of BTC & ETH ETF holdings, which has escalated the selling pressure over the token. Presently, the BTC price has whipped out the gains incurred in the past 6 months, flashing massive bearish signals for the start crypto. Short Liquidations Outperform Longs! Ever since the price has broken down from the consolidated range around $96,000, the traders appear to have become bearish on Bitcoin. As the price continues to plunge hard, the market participants have started shorting BTC, which has now outperformed the longs. The data from Coinglass suggests a huge accumulation of Bitcoin shorts. As seen in the above chart, huge bets have been placed against Bitcoin shorts, which have outnumbered longs by 10:1. While the number of longs leveraged is around $10 million, the longs leveraged shorts have reached above $1.52 billion. However, another huge cluster is around $78,565 and breaking below this range is believed to push the price below $75,000. What’s Next for the Bitcoin (BTC) Price Rally? The weekly chart of Bitcoin has turned extremely bearish as the one single weekly candle has squashed all the gains incurred in the past several months. The bullish sentiments of the traders are slowly plunging, hunting towards more dreadful days approaching the BTC price rally. Presently, the price is heading towards crucial support, and if the bulls fail to defend these levels, another 20% pullback could drag the levels below the previous highs. The BTC price has plunged and is testing the crucial support, which had been a strong resistance during the previous bull run. The bulls are required to trigger a rebound from here, or else the token is feared to repeat the previous pattern. Previously, in 2022, the price broke down from the ascending trend line and dumped hard to the support zone along the 2018 highs, which formed the bottom of the prevailing bear market. Therefore, if the Bitcoin (BTC) price fails to rebound and breaks the support at $72,207, the selling pressure may escalate, dragging the levels close to previous highs close to $69,000.

This decision marks a significant shift in how meme coins are treated by U.S. regulators. While the SEC is stepping back from enforcement, other agencies such as the CFTC may still pursue actions against fraud related to meme coins. This move could open up new opportunities for innovation within the meme coin space but also raises concerns about potential fraud and scams in the market. According to the SEC, meme coins are generally purchased for entertainment, social interaction, or cultural reasons, with their value driven primarily by speculation and market demand. The Commission stated that because these coins often have little to no functional use, they do not qualify as securities under U.S. federal laws. In light of this, the SEC has decided to stop enforcing securities regulations on meme coins, marking a shift in its approach to crypto regulation. This shift aligns with comments made by Commissioner Hester ""Crypto Mom"" Peirce, who suggested that the SEC may seek to delegate enforcement responsibilities for meme coins to other agencies like the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Despite this loosening of regulations, the SEC made it clear that it will continue to take action against fraudulent behavior related to meme coins. The Commission emphasized that fraud involving the offer and sale of meme coins could still be prosecuted under other federal and state laws by different agencies. Essentially, while the SEC is backing off from regulating meme coins, it has sent a message that scammers should still be cautious as other regulators may take action against them. Fraud prevention remains a priority, but the SEC has signaled a hands-off approach to the broader meme coin space. This new policy is seen by many as a positive development for the crypto industry, as it could encourage more innovation and activity within the meme coin market. The lighter regulatory approach could allow more projects to emerge and encourage more people to participate in the meme coin space. The decision may also lead to greater involvement from public figures and celebrities who could launch their own meme coins, potentially leading to more market hype and excitement. However, there is a downside to this change. The meme coin market has been plagued with scams, and the SEC’s reduced involvement could create a situation where fraudulent activities proliferate. High-profile scams, such as the LIBRA rug pull and the North Korean Lazarus Group’s use of meme coins to launder stolen funds, highlight the potential risks in this space. While the SEC is stepping back from enforcement, there remains a need for consumer protection in an industry prone to manipulation and fraud. The long-term impact of this decision is uncertain. On one hand, looser restrictions could foster greater creativity and expansion in the meme coin market, as new projects and coins emerge without the fear of heavy regulation. On the other hand, this could also lead to an increase in risky or fraudulent projects, as the barrier for launching meme coins becomes lower. The SEC’s decision may allow for more celebrity-driven coin launches and pump-and-dump schemes, further contributing to the market's instability. Overall, the SEC’s new policy signals a shift toward a more relaxed stance on meme coins, which could stimulate innovation and activity in the market. However, it also presents challenges, as the reduction in oversight may lead to an uptick in scams and fraudulent activities. The key question moving forward is whether other regulatory bodies will step in to fill the gap left by the SEC’s withdrawal, ensuring that consumer protection remains a priority without stifling the potential for growth in the meme coin space. This is a moment of transition for the meme coin market, and only time will tell how it will evolve under the new regulatory environment.",,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|COMMODITY|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-28 08:08:39

Out of these, nearly half were liquidated on BTC, but Geoff Kendrick’s trust in this digital asset remains maintained, as he forecasts a massive rally. More importantly, he doubled his initial Bitcoin price prediction, claiming to witness $500k by the end of Donald Trump’s presidency. Let’s dive into that. Inside Geoff Kendrick’s $500K Bitcoin Price Prediction: What’s Driving It? Geoff Kendrick, the head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, is a renowned name in the crypto industry. He is among the top crypto supporters and has often presented forecasts. In a recent interview with CNBC, Kendrick reiterated his belief that institutional adoption and regulatory clarity will propel BTC to new heights. He pointed out the growing institutional interest in digital assets and that major financial institutions like BlackRock and Standard Chartered, which are working toward integrating BTC into traditional finance, are the driving forces behind massive growth. More importantly, Kenrick believes that volatility and market turbulence will settle over time as large investors approach the industry. What we need are traditional financial players, like Standard Chartered, BlackRock, and others that have ETFs now to really step in,” Kendrick stated. Among these discussions, the highlight of the interview is his prediction that the Bitcoin price would be $500k by the end of Donald Trump’s presidency. Before this, he also predicted that BTC would hit $200k by the end of 2025, That should add to that medium term, top-side potential, which for me is bitcoin up to $200,000 this year, and $500,000 before Trump leaves office. This statement came as Kendrick discussed how clearer regulations, particularly in the U.S., will open the doors for institutional investors, who will be key drivers of BTC’s price surge. He also discussed regulations as the solution to security risk, citing the recent Bybit hack. As the industry becomes more institutionalized, it should be safer,” Kendrick noted, highlighting how security risks—like the recent $1.4 billion Bybit hack—could be mitigated through regulated financial entities. Geoff Kendrick’s forecast considers the growing adoption, the emergence of institutional investors, and better regularity clarity. However, the ongoing market turbulence cannot be ignored due to such bullish Bitcoin price predictions. Bitcoin’s Brutal Sell-Off and Market Conditions Geoff Kendrick has attempted to shape investors’ trust in this asset, but the most significant current correction cannot be ignored. Although Bitcoin achieved the ATH of $109.1k, it plunged to $80k this week, which is the biggest correction in months. This crypto market crash has resulted in the liquidation of $860M, with $707M in long positions. This happened as the BTC ETF witnessed record-breaking outflows of $938M and growing tensions over Trump’s tariff introduction. However, crypto influencers still call it a buying opportunity, boosting investor sentiments. Market Sentiment: Investors Are More Confident This Time Despite the market sell-off, the Santiment report claims that crypto traders are optimistic despite the price crash. The firm concludes the market discussion on various social media platforms and claims that investors view this dip as a prime buying opportunity. Traders are showing a very high level of confidence that this dip is ‘the one to buy, ‘” the report stated. Crypto personalities like Geoff Kendrick, Michael Saylor, and Matt Houghan have played a significant role. The founder of Microstrategy even advised investors to sell their kidneys if necessary but hold their BTC. Sell a kidney if you must, but keep the Bitcoin, posted Michael Salor Although this statement received backlash, he is known for such rational advice. Additionally, Matt Houghan claimed that this was the right time to buy BTC. Notably, such posts and their advice on buying the dip affected investors’ sentiments. However, Santients’ report also warned that excessive optimism can be a threat, as it often leads to further correction. Will Geoff Kendrick’s $500k Prediction Come True? Since Donald Trump’s win in the US election, the price of Bitcoin has surged exponentially, showcasing impressive gains. Many analysts, including Standard Chartered’s Geoff Kendrick, have presented a bullish outlook for this digital asset in 2025 and beyond. Although the market is experiencing short-term volatility, confidence among market enthusiasts is still high. As Kendrick’s prediction is based on adoption and regularity, the $200k target may be achieved in 2025 and higher in the future. However, this is just an anticipation, and the market’s uncertainty could bring different results.

The agency equated themed cryptos to collectibles, making them immune to federal securities laws. The regulator stated : Meme coins typically are purchased for entertainment, social interaction, and cultural purposes, and their value is driven primarily by market demand and speculation. In this regard, meme coins are akin to collectibles.

This Undervalued Crypto is Gaining Major Traction,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/02/the-best-altcoin-to-hold-for-2025-this-undervalued-crypto-is-gaining-major-traction,"2025 is a post-halving year, which historically means a bullish surge is expected. This could be the biggest bull market ever as the institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies is at its highest. Therefore, investors are eager to know the best altcoin to hold to be on the winning side in this bull run. In this text, we will discuss experts’ choice of the best altcoin to hold and why the project stands out. Undervalue Gem that Experts Believe is the Best Altcoin to Hold In 2025, AI and blockchain are colliding harder than ever. Also, the world generally is moving towards AI based projects and the announcement of the Stargate project by Donald Trump further fuels this narrative. Therefore, AI altcoins are the major focus of savvy investors as they are expected to deliver the most ROI. PropiChain (PCHAIN) , a decentralized real estate marketplace project, stands out to experts. This is due to its innovative approach to reshaping the global real estate market with AI tech at its core and other tools like the Metaverse and blockchain. The project has been gaining traction in the early CoinMarketCap listing bolstered the project's visibility and also earned it credibility in the global cryptocurrency market. Early investors that participated in the first round of PCHAIN’s crypto presale are already in profit by more than 150%. It is currently going for $0.011 in the second round and this lowest because it will increase by more than 100% in the next phase. Factors Behind the Massive Traction that PropiChain is Gaining PropiChain's proposed improvements to the real estate sector have enticed investors to use AI altcoin. Traders will gain easy entry into the global real estate market and have better purchasing experience with PCHAIN’s fractional ownership model. Users of the decentralized platform will be able to own percentages in assets with as little as $100. With AI technology at its core, PCHAIN users can enjoy simplified assets and investment management. For instance, the vastness of the $300 trillion industry often makes identifying and picking the best opportunities difficult for investors. However, with the advanced filtering model on PCHAIN’s decentralized platform, properties that meet your investment goals can be highlighted when you search for advanced criteria like strong rental properties, etc. Artificial intelligence also handles complex calculations concerning property valuation. It uses the Automated Valuation Model, which ensures properties are not overvalued or undervalued. This is because the AVMs can access the historical price performances and the current trends, eliminating the chances of overpaying or being underpaid. PCHAIN users will also enjoy simplified transactions because AI assists in automating some naturally stressful activities. For instance, if you wish to buy or sell an asset when the value hits a certain price, you can automate the operation. Instead of monitoring the market yourself, the PCHAIN AI will execute your wish once the terms are met. The predictive market analysis feature of the AI will help new and existing users make sound investment decisions. The AI-driven appraisal of statistics from different sources will help you identify properties that will grow in value from those that will fall. These will aid strategic decisions by PCHAIN investors. Another standout feature of PCHAIN is the Metaverse feature. This opens the door of global real estate for international buyers and sellers to inspect assets, display listed ones, and for them to interact to reach an agreement. Smart contracts on PropiChain's decentralized platform can automate lease contracts and also execute renewals. For example, you can set your lease terms, and once another user accepts them, a binding lease agreement will be created. All these are completed and stored on PropiChain's public ledger.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $3.98 by the end of 2028. By 2031, WIF’s price may surge to $6.46. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. However, a massive bear market ensued, and WIF lost momentum. Leaving investors asking: How high can dogwifhat crypto go? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $0.64 Market cap $572,272,889.11 Trading volume $342,641,465.12 Circulating supply 998,841,207.34 WIF All-time high $4.85 on March 31, 2024 All-time low $0.000023 on November 2023 24-hour high $0.6012 24-hour low $0.5486 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 25.98% 50-day SMA $1.112 14-Day RSI 33.65 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 16 (Extreme Fear) Green days 7/30 (23%) 200-Day SMA $2.07 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis: WIF to break past resistance at $0.669? TL;DR Breakdown WIF is currently in the oversold region. Dogwifhat (WIF) resistance is present at around $0.590. WIF’s immediate support level is present at $0.536. Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart: WIF struggles to break out of bearish trend The 1-day chart for WIF on February 28 shows the coin trading below the 20, 50, and 200-day SMA and struggling to recover from a prolonged bearish trend. WIF gained some momentum but hit resistance at $0.669, causing a decline to the $0.536 – $0.590 range. The MACD, on the other hand, suggests growing buying momentum, as the MACD line is above the signal line. WIF struggles to break out of a bearish trend The RSI indicates the asset is in oversold territory, hinting at a potential bounce provided buyers pump in liquidity. A break above $0.669 is needed to confirm any signs of recovery, while a drop below the $0.536 support region could result in a further decline towards $0.4. Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart: WIF shows consolidation after a minor upside The 4-hour WIF/USDT chart suggests possible short-term consolidation after a minor upside. Dogwifhat currently trades just above the middle Bollinger Band (a short-term support level). A bounce from this level could lead to another attempt at the $0.620 resistance level. WIF shows consolidation after a minor upside The Balance of Power (BOP) suggests that the bulls are gaining some hold on the market. However, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicates money outflows, which could limit any potential upside in the short term. WIF needs to recapture the $0.610 price level and break past resistance at $0.620 to confirm the position of the BOP indicator. Dogwifhat technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.9185 SELL SMA 5 $0.7951 SELL SMA 10 $0.8307 SELL SMA 21 $0.7279 SELL SMA 50 $1.1123 SELL SMA 100 $1.8528 SELL SMA 200 $2.07 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.7798 SELL EMA 5 $0.9474 SELL EMA 10 $1.2288 SELL EMA 21 $1.5698 SELL EMA 50 $2.04 SELL EMA 100 $2.26 SELL EMA 200 $2.28 SELL What to expect from WIF price analysis? The broader outlook for WIF is bearish. In the meantime, a recapture and break out of the $0.610 – $0.669 price level is needed to confirm a possible bullish reversal, while a long-term push above $0.719 could signal a sustainable uptrend. A failed bullish attempt could result in further price declines towards $0.503. Is Dogwifhat crypto a good investment? Dogwifhat (WIF) is a meme coin on the Solana blockchain. Its value is driven by community interest and speculation. Projections indicate that by 2025, the price could recover to about $1.5 to $2. While it may have potential for short-term gains, it’s equally risky. Only invest after thorough research. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank and several other s . Why is $WIF down? WIF is down after facing rejection at $0.5875. The coin is down due to diminishing market interest and folding liquidity triggered by massive selloffs and a shift to other assets that investors consider more profitable. Dogwifhat (WIF) price chart | Coinmarketcap Will WIF reach $10? Having reached a peak price of $4.85 in 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Can Dogwifhat reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and could be unlikely. Its market must be at least $99.9 billion – a value that exceeds the highest market cap ever for a meme (Dogecoin) at $88.79 billion. DOGE’s marketcap history | GlobalData Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $1.5 by 2025 and about $6 to $8 by 2031. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

40952565,https://nulltx.com/?p=146040,1740734538,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Bitcoin Liquid Staking Token Market: A $4B Surge in Total Value Locked,https://nulltx.com/bitcoin-liquid-staking-token-market-a-4b-surge-in-total-value-locked/,"The ecosystem of the Bitcoin Liquid Staking Token (LST) is watching an impressive growth, with the total value locked (TVL) crossing the $4 billion mark. With more Bitcoin investors aiming to amplify their returns by not just holding, but staking, their assets in DeFi protocols, liquid staking has cemented its status as a go-to channel. And this recent burst in the Bitcoin LST ecosystem definitely derives from the generally perceived merits of liquid-staking products. Key Players in the Bitcoin LST Ecosystem Bitcoin liquid staking is an emerging sector within the digital asset space that allows users to stake their Bitcoin while not having to surrender access to their assets. Liquid staking lets users effectively do two things simultaneously: earn staking rewards and retain liquid access to their Bitcoin. Prominent key actors in the space—such as Lombard Finance, Pumpbtcxyz, and Solv Protocol—are busy at work pushing this young market forward. Lombard Finance is at the front with 20,140.31 LBTC in total value locked. This protocol has positioned itself as one of the most commanding forces in the Bitcoin liquid staking arena. By giving users the chance to stake Bitcoin and receive LBTC tokens, Lombard Finance has amassed a hefty portion of the market’s liquidity. That liquidity is being deployed in any number of directions throughout the DeFi universe, with users of LIquid Staking BTC supposedly reaping the benefits of two yield streams: staking and whatever else they may be doing with LBTC. Is that it? Is two streams better than one? Following closely is Solv Protocol, a protocol recognized for its innovative take on liquid staking and decentralized finance. With its staking solutions, especially the SolvBTC.BBN token—which boasts a total value locked of 10,049.11 BTC—Solv has attracted quite a bit of attention. Solv Protocol stands out for successfully weaving together liquid staking with an assortment of DeFi instruments and providing users with an array of yield farming and liquidity options. Besides the protocol’s BTC-centered solutions and the SolvBTC.BBN in particular, Solv offers new kinds of instruments that appear to draw on its core expertise. These new instruments hint at a much broader user base SOV is courting: investors that venture into all kinds of liquidity and yield opportunities. Another significant player in this space is pumpbtcxyz, with 6,267.79 pumpBTC, providing liquidity and yield opportunities for Bitcoin holders through its innovative staking mechanisms. The rise of pumpBTC shows the Bitcoin LST market is not limited to just a few dominant players. Bitcoin Liquid Staking Token Outlook Recording the current landscape of the Bitcoin LST market with more than $4B in total value locked. @Lombard_Finance – 20,140.31 LBTC @SolvProtocol – 10,049.11 SolvBTC.BBN @Pumpbtcxyz – 6,267.79 pumpBTC @Bedrock_DeFi – 4,248.44… pic.twitter.com/SC2HztbOX7 — Bitcoin Ecosystem (@BitcoinEcoTK) February 26, 2025 Other Notable Players in the Market Although Lombard Finance, Solv Protocol, and Pumpbtcxyz are leading in the race, other protocols have started to make extraordinary inroads with captivating Bitcoin liquid staking solutions. Bedrock DeFi—a far cry from the traditional DeFi narrative—has, with its 4,248.44 uniBTC, put together a staking solution for Bitcoin holders with an emphasis on security and scalability. Its users can confidently stake their assets and earn rewards thanks to Bedrock’s architecture. Lorenzo Protocol’s stBTC token (which has, at last count, a 1,451.51 stBTC TVL) has also gained traction due to its excellent liquid staking mechanism, which allows users to access liquidity while they stake their Bitcoin. Acorn Network, which has 1,197.14 aBTC, is becoming a prominent player in the liquid Bitcoin staking arena. The protocol focuses not just on sustainability—still a hot topic in the crypto space—but also on providing long-term yield strategies for Bitcoin holders. Acorn Network offers a risk-reward ratio that is far more appealing for liquid staking than what’s currently available from other projects. Newer entrants such as allo.xyz and pStakeFinance are driving innovation with their own liquid staking tokens. alloBTC, which is backed by 544.13 BTC, and YBTC from pStakeFinance, with a TVL of 300 BTC, are examples of the growing diversification within the Bitcoin LST ecosystem. These are much smaller players in comparison to Coinbase and BlackRock. But as they continue to evolve, the novel staking strategies, liquidity mechanisms, and other barely imagined provisions of their Bitcoin LSTs could have a profound impact on the market. The Future of Bitcoin Liquid Staking Total value locked exceeds $4 billion, signaling growth. DeFi users have long demanded the ability to generate returns without forfeiting access to their funds. By introducing the concept of liquid staking, protocols now offer a new way to achieve that. Over the next few months, it will be captivating to see how rivalry among these protocols develops and how new advancements in staking technologies might affect the landscape. An interest in liquid staking that is burgeoning means that the future of Bitcoin LSTs is bright and seems to hold a lot of prospects for crypto investors who either are or are not fiends for the fast-paced action they might experience on Wall Street.

40952624,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=135258,1740734639,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,China’s Shock Response: Trump’s Tariffs Threaten Crypto Market Stability,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/chinas-vow-against-trumps-tariffs/,"Hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts! The global economic stage is heating up once again, and this time, it’s the escalating trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies, the United States and China, taking center stage. When former U.S. President Donald Trump slapped an extra 10% tariff on Chinese goods, the dragon didn’t just sit back and take it. China, a major player in the cryptocurrency landscape, swiftly announced it would take “all necessary measures” in response. But what does this mean for your crypto portfolio? Let’s dive into the potential ripple effects of this trade tussle and how it could impact the volatile world of digital currencies. Decoding China’s Stance on Tariffs: What ‘Necessary Measures’ Really Means When China says it will take “all necessary measures,” it’s not just diplomatic rhetoric. It’s a clear signal of intent to retaliate and protect its economic interests. But what kind of measures are we talking about? While the official statement is deliberately vague, we can infer potential actions based on past trade disputes and current geopolitical dynamics. These measures could range from: Increased Tariffs on U.S. Goods: This is the most direct and expected response. China could impose or increase tariffs on a range of American products, mirroring the U.S. actions. This tit-for-tat approach is a classic feature of trade wars and can escalate quickly. Non-Tariff Barriers: Beyond tariffs, China might implement non-tariff barriers, such as stricter regulations, customs delays, or increased scrutiny on U.S. businesses operating in China. These measures can be just as damaging as tariffs and harder to quantify. Currency Devaluation: While less likely to be explicitly stated, China could allow its currency, the Yuan, to depreciate. A weaker Yuan makes Chinese exports cheaper and U.S. imports more expensive, effectively offsetting the impact of tariffs. However, this is a double-edged sword with potential risks to China’s own economy. Strategic Resource Control: China is a major player in global supply chains, particularly for rare earth minerals crucial for various industries, including technology and renewable energy. Restricting exports of these resources could be a strategic countermeasure. For the cryptocurrency market, these measures can indirectly and directly create volatility and uncertainty. Let’s explore how. The Shockwaves Through the Cryptocurrency Market: Impact of US China Trade War The cryptocurrency market, known for its inherent volatility, is particularly sensitive to global economic shifts. The US China Trade War and the resulting trade tensions can act as a significant catalyst for market fluctuations. Here’s how: Investor Sentiment and Risk Aversion Trade wars breed uncertainty. When major economies clash, investors tend to become risk-averse. This often leads to a flight to safety, where investors move their capital away from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies towards more traditional safe havens like gold or government bonds. A decrease in investor confidence can trigger sell-offs in the crypto market, leading to price drops. Global Economic Slowdown Concerns Escalating trade tensions can hinder global economic growth. Tariffs increase the cost of goods, disrupt supply chains, and reduce overall trade volume. A slowdown in the global economy can impact various sectors, and the cryptocurrency market is not immune. Reduced economic activity can translate to less disposable income for investment, potentially affecting the inflow of funds into cryptocurrencies. Supply Chain Disruptions and Technological Impacts The US China Trade War has significant implications for technology supply chains. Many cryptocurrency mining operations and hardware manufacturers rely on global supply chains, often involving components from both the US and China. Tariffs and trade restrictions can disrupt these supply chains, increasing costs for miners and potentially affecting the efficiency and profitability of mining operations. This, in turn, can influence the supply and demand dynamics within the crypto market. Currency Fluctuations and Crypto as a Hedge? As mentioned earlier, currency devaluation is a potential tool in trade wars. Fluctuations in fiat currencies, particularly the Yuan and the US dollar, can impact cryptocurrency prices. Some investors view cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, as a hedge against fiat currency devaluation and economic uncertainty. In times of global economic turmoil, we might see increased interest in cryptocurrencies as a store of value, potentially driving up demand and prices. However, this is not a guaranteed outcome, and the crypto market’s reaction can be complex and unpredictable. China Tariffs and the Crypto Mining Landscape: A Looming Shadow? China’s role in cryptocurrency mining is undeniable, despite recent crackdowns. While the Chinese government has taken steps to curb domestic crypto mining, Chinese entities still hold significant influence in the global mining landscape. Trump’s China tariffs , and China’s retaliatory measures, could cast a shadow over this sector. Let’s consider the potential impacts: Impact Area Potential Effect on Crypto Mining Increased Costs of Mining Hardware Tariffs on imported components could raise the cost of mining equipment, making mining less profitable, especially for smaller operations. Supply Chain Bottlenecks Disruptions in global supply chains could lead to delays in obtaining mining hardware and components, impacting mining capacity and expansion plans. Shift in Mining Geographies Higher costs and operational challenges in regions affected by trade tensions might incentivize miners to relocate to areas with more favorable trade policies and energy costs. Impact on Mining Pools Mining pools with significant operations in affected regions could face operational challenges, potentially leading to shifts in hash rate distribution across different pools. It’s important to note that the long-term effects on crypto mining are still uncertain and will depend on the duration and intensity of the US China Trade War. Navigating the Trade Tension Turbulence: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what can crypto investors do to navigate these turbulent times of trade tensions and potential market volatility? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on developments in the US China Trade War and their potential impact on the cryptocurrency market impact . Follow reputable news sources and crypto market analysis platforms. Diversify Your Portfolio: Diversification is key in volatile markets. Don’t put all your eggs in one crypto basket. Consider diversifying across different cryptocurrencies and asset classes to mitigate risk. Manage Risk: Understand your risk tolerance and adjust your investment strategy accordingly. Consider using risk management tools like stop-loss orders to limit potential losses. Long-Term Perspective: Cryptocurrency investments are often viewed as long-term plays. Try to avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term market fluctuations driven by trade war news. Consider Stablecoins: In times of extreme volatility, you might consider temporarily parking some of your crypto holdings in stablecoins to preserve capital and reduce exposure to price swings. The Unfolding Drama: What’s Next for China Tariffs and Crypto? The situation surrounding China tariffs and the US China Trade War is dynamic and constantly evolving. The “necessary measures” China will take remain to be seen, and the impact on the cryptocurrency market impact will unfold over time. The crypto market’s reaction will depend on a multitude of factors, including the specific nature of China’s response, overall investor sentiment, and broader global economy trends. While trade wars introduce uncertainty and potential risks, they also create opportunities. Periods of volatility can be opportune times for strategic investors to accumulate assets at lower prices. The key is to stay informed, manage risk effectively, and maintain a long-term perspective in the face of short-term market turbulence. The shock of these trade tensions is a reminder of the interconnectedness of the global economy and the cryptocurrency market. As the drama unfolds, one thing is certain: the crypto world will be watching closely, adapting, and innovating in response to these unprecedented challenges.

This individual converted 720 stETH (valued at roughly $1.67 million) into two major assets: AAVE and MKR. These trades gave a lot of people (including us) in the crypto market pause to think. Why? Because 0x3d6 is clearly using some sort of concentrated accumulation strategy in the DeFi space. A Strategic Play in AAVE and MKR First, 0x3d6 swapped 460 stETH—roughly $1.07 million—for 5,288 AAVE at an average price of $201.96 per token. This was the whale’s first purchase of AAVE, which many consider a core asset in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. With the swap, 0x3d6 now holds 6,635 AAVE, worth about $1.35 million. The price point was advantageous, and analysts estimate the whale’s current unrealized profit at around $216,000, for a gain of approximately 13.8%. After the AAVE swap, the whale turned its attention to MKR, the governance token of the MakerDAO ecosystem. In this trade, 0x3d6 swapped 260 stETH—worth $604,000—for 365.5 MKR at an average price of $1,652 per token. This is the whale’s second MKR purchase and follows a previous trade made between August 31, 2023, and July 22, 2024, where the whale made an estimated profit of $603,000, or 101%, on its MKR holdings. The whale’s continued interest in MKR is a sign of strong belief in the long-term value of the MakerDAO ecosystem, which has continued to show resilience in the DeFi sector. In the past 6 hours, whale 0x3d6 spent 720 stETH ($1.67M) to buy AAVE and MKR: Swapped 460 stETH ($1.07M) for 5,288 AAVE at an average price of $201.96 Swapped 260 stETH ($604K) for 365.5 MKR at an average price of $1,652 pic.twitter.com/EbkcIY1uFo — EyeOnChain (@EyeOnChain) February 27, 2025 Historical Context of Whale’s Trading Strategy A glimpse into the sophisticated trading strategy behind these transactions can be gleaned from the whale’s track record. The last MKR trade, which earned over $600,000, underscores 0x3d6’s knack for unearthing the kinds of golden DeFi opportunities that many miss. In its chase of the MKR profits, this whale moved in and out of positions with inhuman grace and perfect timing. Now, it’s buying more Maker and reinforces our read of this increasingly confident whale as one that is staking a big bet on the DeFi ecosystem. For AAVE, this is the whale’s first foray into the asset, but the size of the trade and the strategic nature of the purchase point toward a well-calculated entry into the DeFi lending protocol. AAVE has long been one of the leading assets in the DeFi space, and with its extensive use case in decentralized borrowing and lending, it is no surprise that 0x3d6 has chosen to build a substantial position in the token. What Do These Trades Mean for the Market? The recent developments with whale 0x3d6 have important effects for AAVE and MKR. The whale’s actions are particularly interesting because it’s a very large investor in these two tokens. When it makes a move, it’s of interest not only for what it could mean for AAVE and MKR individually but also because it might signal a trend for other big institutional investors or traders to follow. (And to be clear, the kind of move 0x3d6 just made is definitely one that could inspire other market participants to go in the same direction.) Whales concentrating on DeFi-related tokens such as AAVE and MKR indicates a trend where the biggest players in the space are taking decentralized finance seriously. This development is also signaling that some of the very largest and very smartest money in the world is acquiring serious DeFi tokens. In the Fi side of things, this is also just a sign that institutional players are in the cryptocurrency markets and either on their way or have arrived already. The trades highlight the importance of liquid staking tokens like stETH, which are increasingly used for large-scale trades. When the whale converted stETH into assets like AAVE and MKR, it maintained exposure to the broader DeFi ecosystem and secured potentially higher returns than what traditional assets could offer. Conclusion Whale 0x3d6’s recent AAVE and MKR trades worth $1.67 million in total provide a glimpse into the strategies that large DeFi investors are employing. Increasingly, these investors are diversifying not only across different asset classes but also within their portfolio of DeFi assets. By doing both, they seem to be banking on the DeFi revolution to continued unfold in the coming years. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

CryptoQuant CEO Sets Critical BTC Price Level at $75K,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-bull-cycle-intact-price/,"Is the Bitcoin bull run still on track? Amidst the ever-turbulent crypto market, investors are constantly seeking signals to decipher the prevailing trends. CryptoQuant CEO, Ki Young Ju, a prominent voice in crypto market analysis, has recently shared his insights on the Bitcoin bull cycle, offering a crucial price point to watch. Let’s dive into his analysis and understand what it means for the future of Bitcoin and the broader crypto landscape. Is the Bitcoin Bull Cycle Truly Intact? CryptoQuant CEO Weighs In Ki Young Ju, the CEO of CryptoQuant, a well-regarded on-chain analytics platform, has taken to X (formerly Twitter) to express his continued bullish sentiment on Bitcoin (BTC). He firmly believes that the Bitcoin bull cycle is not over, offering a beacon of hope for those invested in the leading cryptocurrency. However, he also injected a dose of realism, highlighting a critical price level that could potentially invalidate his optimistic outlook. According to Ki Young Ju, a significant drop below $75,000 for BTC would signal a shift in his perspective. This price point acts as a crucial line in the sand, separating a healthy consolidation phase within a bull market from a potential trend reversal. While acknowledging the possibility of a 30% drawdown – a common occurrence in the volatile crypto space – his core thesis remains bullish as long as Bitcoin stays above this key threshold. Key Takeaways from CryptoQuant CEO’s Analysis: Bullish Stance: Ki Young Ju maintains a bullish outlook on Bitcoin, indicating confidence in the continuation of the current bull cycle. Critical Price Level: $75,000 is identified as a crucial level. A significant drop below this point would challenge his bullish view. 30% Drawdown Possible: He acknowledges the potential for a substantial price correction, which is typical in crypto markets, but views it as part of the bull cycle as long as the $75K level holds. Understanding Liquidity and its Role in the Crypto Market Analysis To further elaborate on his viewpoint, Ki Young Ju delved into the crucial concept of liquidity within the crypto market analysis. He explained that during distribution phases, price declines are often triggered by a drying up of liquidity. This makes the influx of fresh liquidity paramount to prevent a temporary dip from morphing into a prolonged bear market. Liquidity, in simple terms, refers to the ease with which assets can be bought and sold without causing significant price fluctuations. In the context of Bitcoin and the broader crypto market, high liquidity is essential for sustained price appreciation. When liquidity diminishes, selling pressure can intensify, leading to sharper price drops as there are fewer buyers to absorb the selling volume. Why is Liquidity So Important in a Bull Cycle? Price Stability: High liquidity provides a buffer against large price swings, contributing to market stability. Sustained Growth: New liquidity, often driven by new investors or increased institutional interest, fuels further price appreciation in a bull market. Market Confidence: Healthy liquidity signals a robust and active market, fostering confidence among investors. BTC Price Consolidation: What to Expect Next? Ki Young Ju anticipates a period of consolidation for BTC price, likely within a broad range of $75,000 to $100,000. He draws a parallel to the early months of 2024, a period characterized by price consolidation before the next major upward move. This phase of consolidation is considered a natural part of market cycles, allowing the market to digest previous gains and prepare for the next leg up. This expected consolidation phase suggests that Bitcoin may trade sideways for a while, fluctuating within the mentioned range. Such periods can be frustrating for traders seeking quick profits, but they are often necessary for building a stronger foundation for future growth. The duration and intensity of this consolidation will largely depend on market sentiment and the influx of new liquidity. Factors Influencing BTC Price Consolidation: Factor Impact on Consolidation Market Sentiment Positive sentiment can shorten consolidation; negative sentiment can prolong it. Liquidity Inflow Strong liquidity inflow can break consolidation upwards; weak inflow can lead to prolonged sideways movement. Macroeconomic Factors External economic events (e.g., interest rate changes) can influence investor risk appetite and impact consolidation. Regulatory Developments Positive regulatory news can boost market confidence and potentially shorten consolidation. The Role of Positive News in Attracting New Liquidity According to CryptoQuant CEO, positive news is the catalyst needed to attract fresh liquidity and propel Bitcoin out of its consolidation phase. This positive news could stem from various sources, including favorable regulatory updates, increased institutional adoption, technological advancements in the Bitcoin ecosystem, or positive macroeconomic indicators. The crypto market is highly sensitive to news flow. Positive developments tend to generate excitement and FOMO (Fear of Missing Out), attracting new investors and capital into the market. This influx of new funds is precisely what is needed to inject fresh liquidity and break through resistance levels, potentially initiating the next phase of the Bitcoin bull cycle. Examples of Positive News that Could Trigger Liquidity Influx: Spot Bitcoin ETF Approvals: Further approvals in different jurisdictions would signal increased mainstream acceptance and attract institutional capital. Favorable Regulatory Frameworks: Clear and supportive regulations can reduce uncertainty and encourage broader adoption. Technological Upgrades: Improvements to Bitcoin’s scalability, security, or functionality can enhance its appeal and drive investment. Institutional Adoption Announcements: Major corporations or financial institutions announcing Bitcoin adoption or investment can boost market confidence. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what does this analysis mean for you as a crypto investor? Here are some actionable insights based on CryptoQuant CEO’s perspective: Monitor the $75K Level: Keep a close watch on Bitcoin’s price action around the $75,000 mark. This is a critical level according to Ki Young Ju’s analysis. Stay Informed on Market Liquidity: Pay attention to indicators of market liquidity. Increased liquidity generally supports bullish trends. Watch for Positive News Catalysts: Be aware of potential positive news developments that could trigger a new wave of liquidity and price appreciation. Prepare for Consolidation: Expect a period of price consolidation in the $75,000 – $100,000 range. Use this time to strategize and manage your portfolio. Maintain a Long-Term Perspective: Remember that bull cycles and consolidations are natural parts of the crypto market. Focus on the long-term potential of Bitcoin and the crypto space. Conclusion: Navigating the Bitcoin Bull Cycle with Informed Optimism CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju’s analysis provides valuable insights into the current state of the Bitcoin bull cycle. While maintaining a bullish outlook, he emphasizes the importance of the $75,000 price level and the role of liquidity in sustaining market momentum. The anticipated consolidation phase presents an opportunity for investors to strategize and prepare for the next potential upward surge, driven by positive news and renewed liquidity. By staying informed and understanding these key market dynamics, investors can navigate the Bitcoin bull cycle with informed optimism and make strategic decisions.

40952764,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=135257,1740734806,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Warning: Why ‘Buy the Dip’ Frenzy Could Trigger a Shocking Price Drop,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-buy-the-dip-warning/,"Are you feeling that familiar urge to ‘buy the dip’ as Bitcoin (BTC) navigates recent price fluctuations? You’re not alone. Across the crypto sphere, from the bustling threads of X (formerly Twitter) to the in-depth discussions on Reddit, Telegram, 4Chan, BitcoinTalk, and Farcaster, the chorus of ‘buy the dip’ is growing louder. But before you jump in headfirst, a crucial on-chain analysis from Santiment might just make you pause and reconsider your strategy. Could this widespread optimism actually be a warning sign for Bitcoin , potentially foreshadowing further price declines? Let’s dive deep into what Santiment’s data reveals and what it means for your crypto portfolio. Decoding Crypto Sentiment: Is ‘Buy the Dip’ a Trap? Santiment, a leading on-chain analytics platform, recently highlighted a fascinating trend: a significant surge in mentions of “buy the dip” across various social and crypto-centric platforms. This might seem like a bullish indicator at first glance – after all, strong buying interest often suggests market confidence. However, Santiment’s analysis suggests a more nuanced, and potentially bearish, interpretation. They point out that in the often unpredictable world of cryptocurrency, crypto sentiment can be a contrarian indicator. When the crowd is overwhelmingly confident, it might actually signal an impending market correction. Here’s the core concept: Crowd Psychology in Crypto: Crypto markets are heavily influenced by emotions – fear and greed. When prices dip, the ‘buy the dip’ mentality kicks in, fueled by the hope of quick gains as the market recovers. Contrarian Investing: Smart investors often look to go against the prevailing crowd sentiment. If everyone is bullish and ‘buying the dip,’ it might mean there are fewer buyers left to push prices higher, increasing the risk of a downturn. Santiment’s Observation: The current surge in ‘buy the dip’ mentions indicates widespread optimism, which, according to historical patterns and contrarian theory, could be a red flag. Think of it this way: when everyone is leaning to one side of the boat, there’s a higher chance it might tip over. In the crypto market, excessive bullishness can sometimes precede a price correction. Why ‘Buy the Dip’ Optimism Could Signal Further Downside for BTC Price Santiment’s report isn’t just based on a hunch. It’s grounded in the analysis of vast amounts of social data and market behavior. Here’s a breakdown of why this ‘buy the dip’ frenzy might be a cause for concern regarding BTC price : Overconfidence Breeds Complacency: When traders are overly confident in the ‘buy the dip’ strategy, it can lead to complacency. Investors might become less vigilant about risk management and potentially overextend themselves, making them vulnerable to market downturns. Exhaustion of Buying Power: A surge in ‘buy the dip’ activity suggests a large number of people are already deploying capital to purchase Bitcoin at lower prices. If this buying power gets exhausted, there might be less support to prevent further price drops. Market Manipulation: While not explicitly stated by Santiment, it’s worth considering that market manipulators can sometimes exploit widespread optimism. They might create temporary price dips to trigger ‘buy the dip’ reactions, only to then sell off larger holdings at slightly higher prices, profiting from the crowd’s enthusiasm. Historical Precedent: Analyzing past market cycles, periods of extreme ‘buy the dip’ optimism have sometimes coincided with local tops or further price corrections. History doesn’t always repeat itself, but it often rhymes, and understanding these patterns is crucial. Delving Deeper into On-Chain Metrics: Beyond the Surface Sentiment While social sentiment provides valuable insights, a comprehensive analysis requires looking at on-chain metrics . These metrics offer a more objective view of what’s happening within the Bitcoin network itself. Santiment and other on-chain analytics platforms track a wide range of data points, including: Exchange Flows: Monitoring the movement of Bitcoin to and from exchanges can indicate buying and selling pressure. Large inflows to exchanges might suggest selling intent, while outflows could signal accumulation. Active Addresses: The number of active Bitcoin addresses can reflect network usage and overall interest. A decline in active addresses during a ‘buy the dip’ phase might suggest waning enthusiasm beyond social media chatter. Transaction Volume: Analyzing transaction volume can provide insights into the level of economic activity on the Bitcoin network. Is the ‘buy the dip’ sentiment translating into actual transaction volume, or is it just online talk? Whale Activity: Tracking the behavior of large Bitcoin holders (whales) is crucial. Are whales also ‘buying the dip,’ or are they taking profits? Their actions can significantly influence market direction. By combining social sentiment analysis with on-chain metrics , analysts can paint a more complete and reliable picture of market dynamics and potential future price movements. It’s not just about what people are saying; it’s about what the data is actually showing. Navigating the ‘Buy the Dip’ Narrative: Actionable Insights for Traders So, what should you do with this information? Does Santiment’s report mean you should immediately sell all your Bitcoin? Not necessarily. However, it does suggest a need for caution and a more strategic approach to navigating the current market situation. Here are some actionable insights: Temper Your Enthusiasm: While ‘buy the dip’ can be a valid strategy, especially in long-term investing, it’s crucial to avoid getting caught up in excessive hype. Don’t let FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) drive your decisions. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Don’t rely solely on social sentiment or headlines. Dive deeper into on-chain data, technical analysis, and fundamental analysis to form your own informed opinion. Manage Your Risk: Implement robust risk management strategies. This includes setting stop-loss orders, diversifying your portfolio, and only investing what you can afford to lose. Look for Contrarian Signals: Pay attention to sentiment indicators like the ‘buy the dip’ mentions. When the crowd is overwhelmingly bullish or bearish, it might be time to consider the opposite perspective. Wait for Confirmation: A truly reliable bullish signal, according to Santiment, would be a decrease in optimism and fewer ‘buy the dip’ mentions. This would suggest that the market has bottomed out and that genuine buying interest is emerging from a place of less hype and more calculated accumulation. Table: Contrasting Market Sentiment Signals Sentiment Indicator Potential Market Signal Trading Strategy Surge in ‘Buy the Dip’ Mentions Potential for further downside; Overly bullish sentiment Exercise caution; Consider taking profits; Tighten stop-losses Decline in ‘Buy the Dip’ Mentions Potential bullish signal; Decreased optimism; Possible bottoming out Look for buying opportunities; Monitor for confirmation signals; Gradual accumulation Conclusion: Is the Bitcoin ‘Buy the Dip’ Narrative a False Hope? Santiment’s analysis serves as a valuable reminder that in the volatile world of crypto, widespread optimism isn’t always a positive sign. The current surge in ‘buy the dip’ mentions surrounding Bitcoin could indeed be a contrarian indicator, suggesting that further price corrections might be on the horizon. While ‘buying the dip’ is a common and sometimes profitable strategy, it’s crucial to approach it with prudence, critical thinking, and a deep understanding of market sentiment and on-chain metrics . By staying informed, managing risk, and being aware of contrarian signals, you can navigate the crypto markets more effectively and make more informed investment decisions. Remember, a truly strong bullish signal often emerges not from euphoria, but from a more measured and less hyped market environment.

40952709,https://coingape.com/?post_type=markets&p=241522,1740734874,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Ethereum (ETH) Price Flashes Death Cross After 25% Crash as MVRV Hits 2022 Levels,https://coingape.com/markets/ethereum-eth-price-death-cross-25-crash-mvrv-2022-levels/,"Ethereum (ETH) has shed 25% this week as it collapsed from a high of $2,930. The brutal sell-off has pushed ETH price to revisit the $2,000 psychological level. This downtrend is due to Bitcoin’s (BTC) nosedive that has pushed it below $80,000 for the first time since November 2024. The bearish sentiment and fears of a bear market are emphasized even more for Ethereum price due to the formation of Death Cross, a well-known sell signal. Additionally, investors who bought ETH a year ago are also facing huge losses, as noted by the MVRV indicator, which has dipped to 2022 levels. Let’s explore what this means for Ethereum price. ETH Price Collapses to $2,000 Amid Bitcoin’s Selling Spree Since February 21, Bitcoin has shed 20.55 %, and Ethereum has crashed 25% . As a result, the 50-day Moving Average (MA) has slid below the 200-day MA, forming the Death Cross. This sell signal shows that the short-term momentum is collapsing faster than the slow MA, suggesting a shift in outlook favoring bears. The 25% crash over the week has pushed ETH price to sweep equal lows at $2,100 , set up on January 1 and August 5, 2024, respectively. Since the $2,000 psychological level is just below where price currently trades, a potential recovery for Ethereum here wouldn’t be unlikely, especially if the market cools off. However, Bitcoin’s sell-off needs to stop for ETH to bounce off the $2,000 psychological level . ETH/USDT v. BTC/USDT 1-week, 1-day Chart ETH Holders Underwater as MVRV Hits 2022 Leves Santiment’s 365-day MVRV reads -32%, which shows the average profit/loss of investors who purchased ETH a year ago is at -32%. This level was seen at the depths of the 2022 bear market, showing that this ETH price crash has surprised many investors. ETH 365-day MVRV ETH Whales Buy As Retail Investors Panic Sell During times of intense market sell-off, retail investors tend to panic sell or fail to buy the dip. On the contrary, whales or institutional investors tend to be buyers during these times. Wallets holding 1,000 to 10,000 ETH accumulated roughly 120K Ether worth $240M since February 21, further highlighting this narrative. ETH Whales Holding 1K to 10K Accumulate as Price Crashes 25% What’s Next for ETH price? ETH price has had a bad reputation due to its lackluster performance in 2024, and to add to its woes, the power struggle happening at the Ethereum Foundation involving Vitalik Buterin and Aya Miyaguci. From a technical perspective, Ethereum recovery is unlikely until the crypto market cools off. Even if Bitcoin stops crashing, Ethereum price is unlikely to bounce back compared to some altcoins like Sonic (previously Fantom) due to the aforementioned events taking place at the Foundation. For now, the key support level to watch if $2,000 gives in is $1,632 . This barrier is where the most volume was traded between June 2022 and November 2023. On the other hand, if $2,000 holds, then the next key level is $3,000 . In addition to being at the psychological level, this level is where the Death Cross appears, a confluence of the 50-day and 100-day MA. Hence, $3,000 will be a tough resistance level to overcome.

40952765,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=135245,1740734888,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Stunning $6.88B Unrealized Bitcoin Gains for Strategy: A Masterclass in Corporate Crypto Investment,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/stunning-bitcoin-gains-strategy-corporate/,"Hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts! The corporate world of Bitcoin is buzzing, and at the center of it all is Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy. They’re not just dipping their toes into the Bitcoin ocean; they’ve plunged in headfirst and are currently riding a massive wave of Bitcoin gains . Imagine holding a treasure chest overflowing with digital gold – that’s essentially what Strategy’s Bitcoin portfolio looks like right now. Let’s dive into the details of their impressive crypto journey and uncover what’s driving these staggering unrealized gains . Decoding Strategy’s Massive Unrealized Bitcoin Gains Strategy’s bold bet on Bitcoin has undeniably paid off – at least on paper. According to MSTR Tracker, a dedicated platform monitoring MicroStrategy’s (now Strategy) Bitcoin holdings, the company is sitting on a staggering $6.88 billion in unrealized gains . But what does ‘unrealized’ actually mean, and why is this such a big deal? Unrealized Gains Explained: Think of it like this: you buy a house for $100,000, and its market value jumps to $200,000. You haven’t sold the house, so you haven’t ‘realized’ the profit in cash yet. Similarly, Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings have appreciated significantly in value since their purchase, but they haven’t sold them to convert those gains into actual dollars. Hence, ‘unrealized.’ The Scale is Astounding: $6.88 billion is not pocket change. To put it in perspective, that’s more than the GDP of some small countries! This massive figure underscores the sheer scale of Strategy’s Bitcoin investment and the potential impact of cryptocurrency on corporate balance sheets. Average Purchase Price vs. Current Value: Strategy’s average purchase price for their Bitcoin is around $66,357 per BTC. With Bitcoin’s price fluctuating but generally trending upwards over time since their major accumulation phase, the difference between their purchase price and the current market value is what fuels these substantial Bitcoin gains . Delving into Strategy’s Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Strategy’s commitment to Bitcoin is nothing short of remarkable. They aren’t just dabbling; they’ve made Bitcoin a core part of their treasury reserve strategy. Let’s break down their corporate Bitcoin holdings : Quantity Matters: Strategy currently holds a whopping 499,096 BTC. To get a sense of this magnitude, consider that the total supply of Bitcoin is capped at 21 million. Owning nearly half a million Bitcoin positions Strategy as a major player in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Strategic Accumulation: Strategy hasn’t acquired all this Bitcoin at once. They’ve employed a strategy of continuous accumulation, often buying more Bitcoin during market dips. This dollar-cost averaging approach can be beneficial in volatile markets like cryptocurrency. Long-Term Vision: Michael Saylor, the former CEO and current Chairman of Strategy, has been a vocal Bitcoin bull. The company’s investment isn’t a short-term gamble; it reflects a long-term belief in Bitcoin as a store of value and a hedge against inflation. This long-term vision is central to their corporate Bitcoin holdings strategy. The MSTR Tracker: Your Window into Strategy’s Bitcoin Journey Want to keep a close eye on Strategy’s Bitcoin performance? That’s where the MSTR Tracker comes in handy. This invaluable tool provides real-time data and insights into their Bitcoin holdings. Here’s why the MSTR Tracker is essential for anyone following this corporate Bitcoin saga: Real-Time Data: The MSTR Tracker provides up-to-the-minute information on Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings, including the total amount of BTC held, the average purchase price, and the current value of their portfolio. This real-time data is crucial in the fast-paced world of crypto. Performance Monitoring: It allows you to track the performance of Strategy’s Bitcoin investment over time. You can see how their unrealized gains fluctuate with Bitcoin’s price movements, providing a clear picture of their investment’s success. Transparency and Insights: The MSTR Tracker promotes transparency in Strategy’s Bitcoin strategy. By making this data publicly accessible, it allows analysts, investors, and the crypto community to understand and analyze their Bitcoin investment strategy . Unpacking Strategy’s Bitcoin Investment Strategy: What Can We Learn? Strategy’s foray into Bitcoin isn’t just a random act; it’s a deliberate and well-articulated Bitcoin investment strategy . What are the key takeaways from their approach, and what can other companies (or even individual investors) learn from it? Embracing Volatility: Strategy’s strategy acknowledges Bitcoin’s inherent volatility but views it as an opportunity rather than a deterrent. They’ve shown a willingness to buy during dips, demonstrating a long-term perspective that can weather short-term price fluctuations. Treasury Diversification: For Strategy, Bitcoin serves as a diversification tool for their treasury reserves, moving away from traditional assets like cash. This highlights Bitcoin’s potential role in corporate finance beyond just a speculative asset. Public Advocacy: Michael Saylor’s public advocacy for Bitcoin has played a significant role in shaping the narrative around corporate Bitcoin adoption. His unwavering conviction has likely encouraged other companies to explore Bitcoin as a treasury asset. Risk Management Considerations: While the Bitcoin gains are impressive, it’s crucial to remember that investing in Bitcoin also carries risks. Strategy’s large holdings mean their balance sheet is significantly influenced by Bitcoin’s price. Risk management, therefore, is paramount in such a strategy. The Future of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings: Is Strategy Leading the Charge? Strategy’s bold move into Bitcoin has undoubtedly sparked conversations about the role of cryptocurrency in corporate finance. Are we on the cusp of a wave of corporate Bitcoin holdings ? While it’s still early days, Strategy’s example provides a compelling case study. Increased Corporate Interest: Strategy’s success story, highlighted by the MSTR Tracker and their substantial unrealized gains , is likely to pique the interest of other corporations seeking alternative treasury strategies. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment surrounding cryptocurrency is still evolving. Clarity and favorable regulations could further encourage corporate adoption of Bitcoin. Market Volatility as a Factor: Bitcoin’s volatility remains a key consideration for corporations. Companies considering following Strategy’s path will need to carefully assess their risk tolerance and develop robust risk management strategies.

The U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF market just experienced a significant tremor. On February 27th, these ETFs collectively witnessed a staggering $266.31 million in net outflows. This marks the eighth consecutive day of net negative flow, raising eyebrows and sparking debates across the crypto community. Let’s delve into the details of this Bitcoin ETF Outflows event and understand what might be driving this trend. Decoding the Bitcoin ETF Outflows: A Detailed Look According to data shared by Trader T (@thepfund) on X, the outflows were widespread, but some ETFs felt the pinch more than others. BlackRock’s IBIT, often touted as a star performer, surprisingly led the pack with the largest outflows, totaling a substantial $192.32 million. WisdomTree’s BTCW followed with $53.78 million, and VanEck’s HODL saw $10.58 million leave its coffers. Here’s a breakdown of the outflows and inflows for a clearer picture: ETF Net Flow (USD Million) BlackRock (IBIT) -$192.32 WisdomTree (BTCW) -$53.78 VanEck (HODL) -$10.58 Grayscale (GBTC) -$7.26 Fidelity (FBTC) -$7.25 Franklin Templeton (EZBC) -$7.23 Grayscale Mini BTC -$5.54 Bitwise (BITB) +$17.65 Other ETFs No Significant Change As you can see, the majority of ETFs experienced outflows, but it’s crucial to note the contrasting performance of Bitwise’s BITB, which bucked the trend with a $17.65 million net inflow. This divergence highlights the nuanced dynamics within the crypto ETF market . Why are Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows Happening? The million-dollar question is: why are we witnessing these consistent spot Bitcoin ETF outflows? Several factors could be at play: Profit Taking: After a period of significant Bitcoin price appreciation, investors might be taking profits off the table. ETFs provide a convenient way to do this, leading to outflows. Market Correction Fears: The broader crypto market can be volatile. Concerns about a potential market correction might be prompting investors to reduce their exposure, including through ETF holdings. GBTC Outflows Continue: GBTC outflows have been a recurring theme since its conversion to an ETF. While the pace might fluctuate, continued withdrawals from GBTC, as seen with another $7.26 million outflow, contribute to the overall negative net flow. Rotation into Other Assets: Investors might be reallocating capital to other asset classes, including different cryptocurrencies or traditional investments, based on market conditions and portfolio strategies. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic uncertainties, interest rate hikes, or inflation concerns can influence investor sentiment and risk appetite, potentially impacting Bitcoin and related ETF investments. IBIT ETF Leading Outflows: A Cause for Concern? The fact that BlackRock’s IBIT ETF experienced the largest outflows is particularly noteworthy. IBIT had been consistently recording inflows and was considered a major driver of the initial Bitcoin ETF success. Is this a temporary blip, or does it signal a shift in investor sentiment towards even the most popular IBIT ETF ? It’s too early to definitively say, but here are a few possibilities: Normal Market Fluctuations: Even successful ETFs can experience periods of outflows. This could simply be a part of normal market dynamics. Large Investor Activity: A few large institutional investors deciding to rebalance their portfolios could significantly impact IBIT’s flow. Performance Concerns (Relative): While IBIT has performed well, investors might be seeking slightly different risk-reward profiles or exploring other ETF options. Bitwise BITB Inflow: A Silver Lining? Amidst the sea of red, Bitwise’s BITB ETF shone green with a $17.65 million inflow. This positive inflow suggests that not all investors are bearish on Bitcoin ETFs. What could be driving interest in BITB? Fund-Specific Appeal: BITB might have features, fee structures, or marketing strategies that are attracting investors even during a period of general outflow. Strategic Allocation: Some investors might be strategically allocating to BITB while reducing exposure to other ETFs based on their specific investment thesis. Value Proposition: Investors may perceive BITB as offering a compelling value proposition compared to its peers, leading to inflows even when the broader trend is negative. Navigating the Crypto ETF Market Volatility The recent Bitcoin ETF Outflows serve as a reminder of the inherent volatility in the cryptocurrency market, even within regulated investment products like ETFs. Investors should consider the following: Long-Term Perspective: Short-term outflows don’t necessarily negate the long-term potential of Bitcoin and crypto ETFs. Focus on your long-term investment goals and avoid knee-jerk reactions to daily market fluctuations. Diversification: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your investment portfolio across different asset classes and within the crypto space itself. Due Diligence: Understand the nuances of each ETF, including its holdings, fees, and tracking error. Choose ETFs that align with your investment strategy and risk tolerance. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, ETF flow data, and macroeconomic developments that can influence crypto markets. Conclusion: A Temporary Setback or a Warning Sign for Crypto ETFs? The $266.31 million net outflow from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on February 27th is undoubtedly a significant event. While eight consecutive days of outflows might sound alarming, it’s crucial to maintain perspective. The crypto ETF market is still relatively new, and fluctuations are expected. Whether this is a temporary setback or the beginning of a more sustained trend remains to be seen. For now, investors should closely monitor ETF flows, Bitcoin price action, and broader market sentiment to make informed decisions. The dynamic nature of the crypto space means surprises are always around the corner, and adaptability is key.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin is valued at $84,397, representing a 2.4% decline in the past 24 hours and a significant 13.7% drop over the past week. These market conditions have sparked a range of analyses, with various on-chain indicators offering insights into current investor behavior. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Demand Levels Return to Neutral Zone—What Next? Bitcoin Latest CDD Spike Could Signal A Market Shift One of the key indicators highlighted recently by a CryptoQuant analyst known as Banker is the Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric. According to Banker, the Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric—a measure of economic activity weighted by the age of coins being moved—has seen a substantial surge. The 60-day CDD indicator, which aggregates these destroyed coin days over two months, indicates that coins held for extended periods are now being spent at a much higher rate. This trend, observed from November 2024 to February 2025, suggests that long-term holders are increasingly active in the market, potentially signaling a pivotal moment for Bitcoin. Banker explains that elevated CDD values often correlate with significant market events. In this case, the sustained uptick in long-term holder activity may hint at profit-taking, asset reallocation, or anticipation of heightened market volatility. While it is not unusual for Bitcoin long-term holders to move coins during periods of major price shifts, the current trend represents the strongest CDD signal since 2021. Historically, such patterns have preceded market turning points, making this metric a critical one to watch. Why CDD Matters Notably, the Coin Days Destroyed metric differs from typical transaction volume as it gives more weight to coins that have remained untouched for longer periods. Each unspent day accumulates “coin days,” and when the holder finally moves those coins, these days are “destroyed.” The 60-day CDD effectively tracks long-term holder sentiment by revealing when these seasoned participants decide to act. As earlier mentioned, a consistent increase in CDD often reflects a growing willingness among long-term holders to take profits or reposition their portfolios—moves that can influence broader market sentiment.

With long-term holders moving their coins at a steady pace, the market could be heading toward a “healthier reset.” This kind of activity often sets the stage for new entrants to step in, potentially stabilizing the market and creating opportunities for fresh capital inflows. However, the implications depend heavily on the broader market context, including macroeconomic factors and investor confidence.

The incident, which unfolded in South Korea, underscores the growing intersection of digital assets and traditional criminal activities, raising critical questions about security and regulation within the crypto space. What Sparked the South Korea Crypto Robbery? According to reports from Newsis, the incident involved two Chinese nationals in their 30s who allegedly targeted a man under the guise of a cryptocurrency transaction. The suspects, now in custody and facing serious charges of aggravated robbery, reportedly lured the victim with the promise of a cryptocurrency purchase. However, their intentions were far from legitimate business dealings. Instead of engaging in a fair transaction, they resorted to violence, assaulting the man and making off with a substantial sum of cash. Here’s a breakdown of the key details of this alarming cryptocurrency crime: Location: Seoul, South Korea Suspects: Two Chinese men in their 30s Victim: Unidentified man persuaded to buy cryptocurrencies Crime: Aggravated robbery Amount Stolen: 30 million won, approximately $20,500 USD Current Status: Suspects arrested and in custody Cryptocurrency Crime on the Rise: A Global Concern This incident in South Korea is not an isolated event but rather a part of a worrying global trend. As cryptocurrencies gain mainstream adoption, they are also attracting unwanted attention from criminal elements. The anonymity and decentralized nature of many cryptocurrencies can, unfortunately, be exploited for illicit activities. From online scams and ransomware attacks to physical robberies like this one, cryptocurrency crime is becoming an increasingly complex challenge for law enforcement agencies worldwide. Several factors contribute to the rise of cryptocurrency crime : Anonymity: While not entirely anonymous, cryptocurrency transactions can be harder to trace compared to traditional banking systems, making them attractive for criminals. Decentralization: The lack of central authority in many cryptocurrencies means there’s no single point of regulation or control, which can be exploited. Growing Value: The increasing value of cryptocurrencies makes them a lucrative target for theft and fraud. Lack of Regulation: In many jurisdictions, cryptocurrency regulations are still evolving, creating loopholes that criminals can exploit. The Modus Operandi: How Did This Crypto Theft Unfold? In this particular case of crypto theft in South Korea, the suspects employed a tactic of persuasion, luring the victim with the promise of a cryptocurrency purchase. This suggests a level of premeditation and planning. It’s likely they used the allure of the crypto market to gain the victim’s trust before executing their criminal act. The fact that they stole cash, rather than cryptocurrency directly, could indicate several possibilities: They might have lacked the technical expertise to steal cryptocurrency directly. They might have preferred the immediate liquidity of cash. They might have believed stealing cash would be less traceable. Regardless of their specific motivations, the outcome was violent robbery, leaving the victim assaulted and financially harmed. South Korea Crypto Landscape: A Hotspot for Innovation and Crime? South Korea crypto market is one of the most vibrant and active in the world. The country has a high rate of cryptocurrency adoption and a tech-savvy population. This enthusiasm for digital assets, however, also makes it a potentially attractive target for criminals. The recent robbery highlights the need for increased vigilance and security measures within the South Korean crypto ecosystem and globally. Here are some aspects that make South Korea a significant player in the crypto world: Factor Description High Adoption Rate South Korea has one of the highest cryptocurrency adoption rates globally, with a significant portion of the population engaging in crypto trading. Tech-Savvy Population The country boasts a highly technologically advanced population, comfortable with digital technologies and online platforms. Active Trading Market South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges are among the busiest in the world, handling substantial trading volumes daily. Regulatory Scrutiny South Korean regulators have been actively working on establishing a framework for cryptocurrency regulation to balance innovation with consumer protection and crime prevention. Financial Crime and Cryptocurrency: What’s the Connection? The robbery in South Korea is a stark example of how cryptocurrency is becoming intertwined with traditional financial crime . While cryptocurrency technology itself is not inherently criminal, its features can be misused for illicit purposes. Law enforcement agencies are increasingly challenged to adapt their strategies to tackle these new forms of crime, which often cross international borders and operate in the digital realm. The connection between cryptocurrency and financial crime can be seen in various forms: Money Laundering: Cryptocurrencies can be used to obscure the origin of illegally obtained funds. Fraud and Scams: Crypto’s novelty and complexity make it a fertile ground for scams and fraudulent investment schemes. Theft and Robbery: As demonstrated in the South Korean case, physical and digital theft of cryptocurrencies and related assets is on the rise. Cybercrime: Cryptocurrencies are often used in ransomware attacks and other forms of cyber extortion. Actionable Insights: Staying Safe in the Crypto World This incident serves as a crucial reminder of the risks associated with cryptocurrency transactions, especially when dealing with unknown parties. While the promise of digital currencies is immense, users must exercise caution and prioritize security. Here are some actionable insights to stay safe in the crypto world and avoid becoming a victim of crypto robbery or similar crimes: Exercise Caution in Offline Transactions: Be extremely wary of meeting strangers in person for cryptocurrency transactions, especially if large sums of money are involved. Use Reputable Exchanges: Stick to well-known and regulated cryptocurrency exchanges for buying and selling digital assets. Secure Your Wallets: Use strong passwords, enable two-factor authentication, and consider using hardware wallets for enhanced security. Be Aware of Scams: Be skeptical of investment opportunities that seem too good to be true, and do thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency. Report Suspicious Activity: If you encounter any suspicious activity or become a victim of crypto crime, report it to the relevant authorities immediately. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call for Crypto Security The arrest of two suspects in South Korea for this crypto-related robbery is a positive step, but it also underscores the urgent need for enhanced security measures and greater awareness within the cryptocurrency community. As the digital asset landscape continues to evolve, so too must our strategies for protecting ourselves from criminal elements seeking to exploit this innovative technology. This incident is a fearful reminder that the crypto world, while full of potential, is not immune to the dangers of the real world.

This expiry event, larger than usual due to the month-end, is expected to have limited direct impact on the spot market, which is already under pressure from US President Donald Trump’s ongoing trade war . The put/call ratio for this options expiry stands at 0.71, indicating a higher number of call (long) contracts compared to puts (shorts). Data from Deribit shows that open interest remains highest at the $120,000 strike price, accounting for $1.5 billion in contracts. Additionally, the $100,000 and $110,000 strike prices have around $1 billion in open interest each, while bearish sentiment is increasing, with $800 million in contracts positioned at the $80,000 strike price—Bitcoin’s current level. Traders brace for further downside risk According to crypto derivatives provider Greeks Live, market sentiment remains predominantly bearish. “Overall Market Sentiment: The group is predominantly bearish with traders watching $82,000 as a critical support level that must hold to maintain the HTF (high timeframe) trend. There is significant concern about the continued downside, with many members discussing the rapid 17% decline over three days and debating whether recent selling is controlled or indicative of a broader market shift,” read the post. BTC was trading at $78,751 at 8:44 am GMT. Technical analysts warn that if the asset closes below the 2024 volume-weighted average price (VWAP) bands, the higher timeframe trend could be at risk, potentially pushing Bitcoin toward the $77,000–$72,000 range. Meanwhile, Ethereum is also facing a major expiry event, with 526,000 options contracts worth $1.14 billion expiring. The put/call ratio of 0.52 indicates relatively balanced positioning, though Ethereum has faced steeper losses than Bitcoin in recent sessions. What will happen to BTC and ETH prices? With Bitcoin facing heightened volatility, some traders are shifting toward call ratio spreads as a defensive strategy. This move is based on the expectation that, following the recent downturn, Bitcoin’s price action may become choppy, with a potential retest of $88,000 before a clearer direction emerges. Deribit reports that traders are preparing for further market turbulence, hedging against the risk of Bitcoin declining to levels last seen after election day. The broader outlook remains weak, exacerbated by US President Donald Trump’s tariffs on Mexico, Canada, China, and Europe . The long-term implications for Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency sector remain uncertain. Despite the current downturn, the max pain price for both Bitcoin and Ethereum remains significantly above their spot prices. With the max pain price exceeding the spot price, options sellers may have an incentive to push Bitcoin and Ethereum prices higher toward that level. “With the end of the month approaching, BTC options traders should take note: Max Pain for Feb 28 sits at $98,000, with a massive $5 billion notional value. This means the highest open interest is clustered here, incentivizing market makers to keep BTC close to this price. Expect increased volatility and potential price gravitation toward this level,” altcoin options exchange PowerTrade stated. Crypto market sell-off deepens The ongoing sell-off in the crypto markets has intensified, with total market capitalization dropping another 8.4% on Friday to $1.6 trillion, according to CoinGecko. The asset has now corrected more than 25% from its all-time high, dipping below $80,000 for the first time since November 10. Ethereum, meanwhile, saw an even steeper decline, falling 8% to $2,150, marking its lowest price in over a year with weekly losses of 22%. “Despite the dip, institutions like Standard Chartered remain optimistic, targeting $500K by the end of Trump’s term. Additionally, Texas’s unanimous approval of a Bitcoin Reserve shows strong government support for the sector. While these positive developments have boosted investor sentiment, it is yet to be reflected in Bitcoin’s price,” Saxena added. Other major cryptocurrencies also slid, with Ethereum down 7%, XRP losing 5%, BNB dropping 4%, and Solana slipping 3.9%. Dogecoin, Cardano, Chainlink, Tron, Sui, Avalanche, Stellar, Litecoin, and Hedera recorded losses between 2% and 8%.

One such crucial indicator is the Altcoin Season Index . Currently, this index, a key metric for gauging the prevailing sentiment in the crypto space, stands at 22. What does this number signify for your crypto portfolio, and are we truly in a Bitcoin Season ? Let’s dive deep to decode this. What is the Altcoin Season Index and How Does it Work? The Altcoin Season Index , meticulously tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), is not just another number; it’s a compass for navigating the crypto market’s ever-shifting tides. Think of it as a barometer, measuring the comparative strength of altcoins against Bitcoin. But how exactly does this index work its magic? Here’s a breakdown: Data Source: The index analyzes the top 100 cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens to provide a pure representation of market dynamics. Performance Window: It assesses the performance of these 100 coins over the past 90 days, offering a medium-term perspective on market trends rather than short-lived pumps and dumps. Bitcoin as the Benchmark: The core of the index lies in comparing altcoin performance against Bitcoin. Bitcoin, as the original and still dominant cryptocurrency, serves as the yardstick. The 75% Threshold: This is the magic number. For the market to be officially declared in ‘Altcoin Season’, at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins must have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. Index Range: The index score ranges from 1 to 100, providing a granular view of market sentiment. A higher score leans towards Altcoin Season, while a lower score indicates Bitcoin’s dominance. In essence, the Altcoin Season Index simplifies a complex market into a single, digestible metric, helping traders and investors understand whether the market is favoring Bitcoin or altcoins . Bitcoin Season vs. Altcoin Season: What’s the Difference? Understanding the difference between Bitcoin Season and Altcoin Season is crucial for strategic crypto investing. It’s not just about which coins are going up or down, but about broader market trends and capital flows. Feature Bitcoin Season Altcoin Season Market Dominance Bitcoin outperforms most altcoins. Capital tends to flow into Bitcoin, often seen as a ‘safer’ crypto asset. Altcoins outperform Bitcoin. Investors are more willing to take risks and explore higher-growth potential in altcoins. Altcoin Season Index Value Index value is low, typically below 25. The current index at 22 firmly places us in Bitcoin Season. Index value is high, ideally 75 or above. This indicates a broad-based altcoin rally. Investor Sentiment Risk-off sentiment. Investors prioritize safety and established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Risk-on sentiment. Investors are more adventurous, seeking higher returns in the diverse altcoin market. Market Action Bitcoin price may rise significantly, or at least hold its value better than altcoins. Altcoins may stagnate or decline in BTC terms. Many altcoins experience significant price surges, often outperforming Bitcoin by a considerable margin. Currently, with the Altcoin Season Index at 22, we are clearly in Bitcoin Season . This means that over the last 90 days, Bitcoin has generally outperformed the vast majority of altcoins in the top 100. Why is the Altcoin Season Index at 22? Decoding the Current Crypto Market The index reading of 22 isn’t just a random number; it’s a reflection of the current state of the crypto market . Several factors can contribute to a prevailing Bitcoin Season : Market Uncertainty: During times of economic or geopolitical uncertainty, investors often flock to Bitcoin as a perceived ‘safe haven’ within the crypto space. This increased demand drives up Bitcoin’s price relative to altcoins . Bitcoin Halving Cycles: Historically, Bitcoin halvings have been followed by periods of increased Bitcoin dominance. Anticipation or immediate aftermath of a halving can strengthen Bitcoin Season . Institutional Investment Flow: Large institutional investors often start by investing in Bitcoin before diversifying into altcoins . Initial institutional inflows predominantly benefit Bitcoin. Regulatory Landscape: Positive regulatory news for Bitcoin, or negative news impacting the broader crypto market (especially altcoins ), can strengthen Bitcoin’s position. Narrative and Media Attention: Mainstream media coverage often focuses on Bitcoin, especially during bull runs or market corrections. This attention can draw new investors primarily to Bitcoin. It’s important to remember that the crypto market is dynamic. A Bitcoin Season doesn’t last forever, and market conditions can shift rapidly. Understanding the underlying reasons for the current index reading helps in making informed investment decisions. Navigating Bitcoin Season: Strategies and Insights So, what should you do when the Altcoin Season Index points to Bitcoin Season ? Here are some actionable insights: Re-evaluate Your Portfolio: Consider if your portfolio is appropriately weighted for a Bitcoin Season . Are you overexposed to altcoins that might underperform Bitcoin in the current market? Focus on Bitcoin Fundamentals: During Bitcoin Season , it’s a good time to research and understand Bitcoin’s fundamentals, technological advancements, and adoption metrics. Identify Strong Altcoins: Not all altcoins are created equal. Even in a Bitcoin Season , some fundamentally strong altcoins with solid use cases and active development may hold their value or even outperform. Research and identify these gems. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) into Bitcoin: If you believe in the long-term potential of Bitcoin, Bitcoin Season can be an opportune time to DCA, accumulating more Bitcoin at potentially favorable prices compared to altcoins . Monitor the Index: Keep a close eye on the Altcoin Season Index . A rising index might signal a shift towards Altcoin Season, prompting you to adjust your strategy accordingly. However, it’s equally important to be aware of the challenges: Market Volatility: The crypto market is inherently volatile. Even during Bitcoin Season , sudden shifts can occur, impacting both Bitcoin and altcoins . False Signals: While the Altcoin Season Index is a valuable tool, it’s not foolproof. It’s just one indicator among many and should be used in conjunction with other analysis methods. Opportunity Cost: Focusing solely on Bitcoin during Bitcoin Season might mean missing out on potential gains in select altcoins that buck the trend. The Future of Altcoin Season Index and Crypto Market Dynamics The Altcoin Season Index provides a valuable snapshot of the current market sentiment, highlighting the ebb and flow between Bitcoin dominance and altcoin surges. As the crypto market matures, and new narratives emerge, understanding these cyclical patterns becomes even more critical for investors. Will the index remain at 22, solidifying Bitcoin Season further? Or will we see a shift towards altcoins in the near future? The answer lies in the evolving dynamics of the crypto market , influenced by technological advancements, regulatory developments, and global economic factors. Staying informed and adaptable is key to navigating this exciting, yet complex landscape. In conclusion, the Altcoin Season Index at 22 is a clear signal: we are currently in Bitcoin Season . This doesn’t mean altcoins are irrelevant, but it does suggest a period where Bitcoin is likely to lead the market.

Meanwhile, a new Chainalysis report reveals that crypto crime hit a record $51 billion in illicit transactions in 2024, with criminals increasingly turning to stablecoins and AI-driven schemes to evade detection. THORChain Rocked by Resignations A THORChain developer announced their departure from the crypto protocol after a controversy over the blocking of transactions linked to North Korean hackers. The developer, known as “Pluto,” stated in a post on X that they will no longer be contributing to the project but would stay available for an orderly hand-off of responsibilities. This decision was made after the fallout from a vote to halt Ethereum transactions on THORChain in an attempt to stop the Lazarus Group from laundering stolen funds. THORChain validator “TCB” revealed that they were among three validators who supported the vote to prevent the group from using the protocol, but the decision was quickly overturned. According to THORSwap developer Oleg Petrov , three votes were required to stop transactions, while four were needed to reverse the halt. With the decision being reverted almost immediately, TCB warned that they will also step away from THORChain unless a solution was quickly implemented to stop the flow of illicit funds. The Lazarus Group has reportedly been using THORChain to launder some of the $1.5 billion that was stolen from the crypto exchange Bybit on Feb. 21. On Feb. 28, blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain reported that the group already moved $605 million worth of Ethereum through the protocol. The controversy comes at a time when THORChain is experiencing a surge in activity. In fact, it recorded its highest-ever daily volume of $860 million in swaps on Feb. 26, followed by $705 million the next day. Due to the mounting pressure after the Bybit hack, the FBI urged crypto validators and exchanges to take action against the Lazarus Group, which effectively confirmed that North Korea was responsible for the hack. TCB also warned that THORChain’s association with such large amounts of stolen funds could escalate the situation into a national security issue. However, THORChain’s founder, John-Paul Thorbjornsen , defended the protocol. He stated that none of the wallet addresses sanctioned by the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control interacted with THORChain, and pointed out that the hackers were simply moving funds too quickly for screening services to detect. Thorbjornsen argued that expecting blockchain protocols like THORChain to enforce censorship was unrealistic. He also pointed out that THORChain nodes operate under very strict rules and can be churned out if they fail to follow protocol guidelines. He downplayed concerns about regulatory intervention by stating that if a node operator feels uncomfortable, they can exit the network, allowing THORChain to adapt as needed. TCB, however, is a lot more skeptical about THORChain’s claims of decentralization, and argued that the protocol is not as resistant to regulatory attacks as Bitcoin due to its smaller validator base. They criticized the network’s design choices, which they claimed make it difficult to onboard new validators, resulting in a small group controlling infrastructure and transaction flows. According to TCB, many corporate actors that provide liquidity for THORChain are already censoring transactions on their front ends and are likely to move away from the protocol if it continues to allow illicit activity. Bybit Hack Shakes Institutional Confidence The recent billion-dollar cybersecurity breach at Bybit dealt a massive blow to institutional adoption of crypto staking, according to Bohdan Opryshko , the chief operating officer of staking services provider Everstake. The hack was carried out by North Korea’s Lazarus Group on Feb. 21, and resulted in the theft of approximately $1.4 billion worth of liquid staked Ethereum, making it the largest exploit in the industry’s history. (Source: Elliptic ) Opryshko stated that such high-profile security breaches discourage institutional investors from allocating funds to crypto assets, particularly staking-related investments. He pointed out that compliance and legal teams evaluating an Ether ETF will likely reconsider their plans after witnessing such a major security failure. The impact of the hack extends beyond investor hesitation, potentially accelerating the trend of stakers withdrawing their assets from centralized crypto exchanges. Over the past six months, the amount of staked Ether on centralized platforms fell from 8.6 million ETH in September to 8 million ETH in February, with a 0.5% decline occurring immediately after the Bybit hack. Many users are opting for non-custodial staking solutions or hardware wallets to enhance security. While Ether ETFs in the United States do not currently permit staking, the SEC recently acknowledged requests from issuers like 21Shares to allow a portion of their holdings to be staked. In Europe, Ether ETFs are already permitted to engage in staking, and analysts believe that US regulators may follow suit in the near future. Since their launch in July, Ether ETFs attracted close to $3 billion in net inflows, according to data from Farside Investors. However, they are still behind Bitcoin ETFs, which have been a key driver of institutional crypto adoption and attracted over $37 billion in net inflows since January of 2024. Ethereum ETF flow (Source: Farside Investors ) Staking itself is a fundamental aspect of the Ethereum blockchain that requires users to lock up their Ether as collateral with a validator in exchange for network rewards. While stakers earn ETH payouts through fees and rewards, they also face the risk of slashing, where part of their collateral is lost if the validator misbehaves. Other blockchain networks, like Solana, also incorporate staking mechanisms. Chainalysis Report Uncovers Record Crypto Crime Wave It seems like crypto crime reached a new level of sophistication, driven by AI-powered scams, stablecoin laundering, and highly efficient cyber syndicates, according to the 2025 “ Crypto Crime Report ” by Chainalysis. The report revealed a record-breaking $51 billion in illicit transaction volume over the past year, overturning initial estimates that suggested a decline in crypto crime. Advanced laundering techniques using stablecoins, decentralized finance, and artificial intelligence created the illusion of reduced illicit activity, while in reality, criminals adapted to evade detection. (Source: Chainalysis ) Traditional cybercrime methods have given way to professionalized fraud cartels, nation-state hackers, and AI-driven deception. While ransomware payments dropped 35% year-over-year, cybercriminals are increasingly shifting away from Bitcoin in favor of stablecoins, Monero, and DeFi exploits. The report revealed a major shift in the landscape, with stablecoins now accounting for 63% of all illicit crypto transactions. Their speed, liquidity, and ability to bypass regulatory oversight made them the preferred tool for laundering large sums of money while evading detection. (Source: Chainalysis ) Unlike Bitcoin, stablecoins offer near-instant transactions without the volatility, making them ideal for criminals who are looking to move funds undetected. In response, stablecoin issuers like Tether have taken action by freezing hundreds of addresses tied to illicit activity, pushing criminals toward alternative privacy-focused solutions like Monero and DeFi-based laundering schemes. As authorities and crypto firms work to counter these threats, the battle against financial crime in the digital space is only becoming more complex.",News|Security,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|EXCHANGE|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-28 09:35:27

However, technical indicators have turned bearish for the altcoin, suggesting a potential pullback is on the horizon. Morpho ( MORPHO ) soared to an intraday high of $2.44 on Friday, marking a 35% rise from its weekly low and bringing its market cap to nearly $500 million as of press time. The recent price rally was accompanied by a surge in trading activity, with daily trading volume doubling from the previous day to over $94 million. Founded in 2021, Morpho is a decentralized, noncustodial lending platform on Ethereum that optimizes lending pools by facilitating direct peer-to-peer interactions. The protocol, which enables overcollateralized lending and borrowing of crypto assets, aims to provide better interest rates for both borrowers and lenders by matching liquidity directly while still relying on traditional lending pools as a fallback when needed. You might also like: Bitcoin ETFs continue to face outflows as BTC dips below $80k Most of today’s gains came after Coinbase listed MORPHO on both the Ethereum and Base networks. As the largest crypto exchange in the U.S., Coinbase has a history of impacting crypto prices with its listings. As earlier reported by crypto.news, the so-called “Coinbase Effect” drove a nearly 30% surge in Popcat’s ( POPCAT ) price after its listing on the exchange. Meanwhile, Morpho’s developers also shared a few updates to go along with the Coinbase listing. The firm noted that their smart contracts are now live on multiple blockchains, including Unichain, Mode Network, Hemi, Corn and Sonic. These contracts have been reviewed by independent auditors and come with a $2.5 million bug bounty. Amid these developments, the hype among its community has pushed MORPHO to trend on Google. Potential correction on the horizon Despite the bullish listing announcement driving fresh interest in the altcoin, there remains a significant risk for MORPHO traders. According to data from IntoTheBlock, about 95% of MORPHO tokens are held by large investors. With over 87% of holders currently in profit, many might decide to sell and lock in gains, especially with the broader crypto market looking bearish. Bitcoin, the bellwether crypto asset, recently dropped below $80,000 , and the crypto fear and greed index hitting a two-year low could prompt a sell-off among risk assets like MORPHO. Technical indicators have also flashed bearish signals. On the 1-day MORPHO/USDT price chart, MORPHO remains under the 50-day moving average, suggesting that bears continue to dominate its market. MORPHO price, 50-day MA and Supertrend Chart — Feb. 28 | Source: crypto.news The Supertrend indicator supports the view as it was seen flashing red and remains above MORPHO’s price. Although MORPHO is still trading above the descending trendline that has been forming since Jan.17, a fall back below the trendline at $2 today could signal a bearish reversal as it marks a key psychological resistance level. In that case, MORPHO might drop further toward its local low of $1.75, last seen on Feb. 8. However, the setup could be invalidated if market sentiment improves and it rallies higher. At press time, MORPHO had already lost some of its daily gains, exchanging hands at $2.26 per coin.

With the SEC recently dropping cases against major crypto firms like Coinbase, Uniswap, and Robinhood, many wonder if Ripple could be next. Could the SEC End the Ripple Case? The SEC sued Ripple in December 2020, saying the company sold XRP as an unregistered security. However, Judge Analisa Torres ruled in 2023 that XRP itself is not a security, weakening the SEC’s case. Now, with increasing pressure on the SEC, people believe the agency might be ready to move on. At the recent SEC meeting, officials discussed legal matters and settlements. While the details are secret, many think the Ripple case may have been included. Former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel does not believe this is a sign of progress, but pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan is confident that Ripple has the upper hand. Political Pressure May Shake the Market Senator Cynthia Lummis recently criticized the SEC’s approach to crypto regulation, stating that most digital assets are not securities under the Howey Test. Meanwhile, this aligns with Judge Torres’ ruling in the Ripple case, further strengthening Ripple’s position. No official decision has been announced yet, but the next key date is April 16 , when Ripple must submit its reply to the SEC’s appeal. If the SEC withdraws before then, it could mark the end of the long-running case, paving the way for a brighter future for XRP. What Next For XRP? As of now, XRP’s price is trading around $2.03 reflecting a drop of 8.19% with a market cap hitting $142 billion. However, many crypto experts believe that if the SEC drops the case, XRP could rise sharply. Some even predict a jump toward $3.20.

According to a February 27 staff statement from the commission’s Division of Corporation Finance, meme coins may not qualify as securities because they don’t meet the Howey test , a legal standard introduced by the Supreme Court in 1946 to determine whether a transaction counts as an investment contract under US securities laws. The SEC wants to provide “greater clarity on the application of the federal securities laws to crypto assets” by clarifying its stance. Meme coins are like ‘collectables’ Rationalising its views, the regulator said meme coins lack the key elements of a security , particularly an investment in a common enterprise where profits come from the “entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.” Instead, the commission views meme coins as driven by “market demand and speculation,” with their value tied to hype rather than structured business growth. Unlike traditional investments, they don’t grant holders financial rights, such as ownership stakes or dividends. An excerpt from the SEC’s statement reads: Although individual meme coins may have unique features, meme coins typically share certain characteristics. Meme coins typically are purchased for entertainment, social interaction, and cultural purposes, and their value is driven primarily by market demand and speculation. Further, the SEC noted that meme coins don’t fit within “any of the common financial instruments specifically enumerated in the definition of ‘security,’” such as stocks or bonds. Unlike traditional investments, they don’t generate yield or provide rights to “future income, profits, or assets of a business.” Since their trading activity doesn’t involve an investment in an enterprise, nor do buyers have a “reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others,” the SEC stated that meme coins fail to meet the Howey test’s criteria for an investment contract and concluded that “a meme coin is not itself a security.” The statement continued: Persons who participate in the offer and sale of meme coins do not need to register their transactions with the Commission under the Securities Act of 1933 or fall within one of the Securities Act’s exemptions from registration. Accordingly, neither meme coin purchasers nor holders are protected by the federal securities laws. However, the commission warned that its stance doesn’t cover all tokens labelled as meme coins. Any project disguising itself as a meme coin while functioning as a security could still face scrutiny. The SEC also said that its views aren’t a “rule, regulation, guidance, or statement” of the commission itself and emphasized that the statement carries “no legal force or effect.” Instead, the regulator wants to provide “greater clarity on the application of the federal securities laws to crypto assets” by clarifying its stance. Meme coins become a heated topic With tokens like Official Trump (TRUMP), launched by US President Donald Trump and Melania Meme (MELANIA), crashing noticeably from their all-time high prices, concerns have been raised over the unregulated nature of the market. As previously reported by Invezz , on the same day, House Democrats introduced the Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement (MEME) Act, which seeks to block public officials and their kin from issuing, endorsing, or profiting from cryptocurrencies.

Donald Trump’s Tariff Shock Trigger Crypto Sell-off appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is facing a brutal correction, wiping out all gains since Donald Trump’s election win in November . The overall market capitalization has dropped 8% to $2.7 trillion, with Bitcoin crashing 7% to $78,000—its lowest since November. The selling pressure intensified after Trump announced fresh tariffs on Chinese imports, sparking fears of a global economic slowdown. According to The Kobeissi Letter, since the trade war fears began on January 20th, the crypto market has lost $800 billion, wiping out gains despite Trump being the most pro-crypto president in history. Bitcoin, once seen as a hedge against uncertainty like gold, now moves in sync with risk assets. Its correlation with the S&P 500 hit 0.88 in 2024, meaning it followed the stock market nearly 88% of the time. Moreover, liquidity concerns are freaking the crypto investors of a biggest crash ever, with crypto weakening as money exits the market. Ethereum Erases All Post-Election Gains After Bitcoin, Ethereum has also taken a major hit, erasing all its post-election rally and plunging 9% since November 5. The Kobeissi Letter highlighted this massive drop, questioning whether a new crypto bear market has begun. ETH is now down nearly 50% from its highs after the election, mirroring the broader market’s sharp decline. Prices are now close to $2,000, the lowest since November, showing a big shift in market mood. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Market Crash Today : 28th FEB – XRP News Why is Bitcoin Crashing? , Pi Network Price , Trump Tariff , Altcoins in Freefall Amid Economic Uncertainty XRP and Dogecoin led the losses, crashing over 10% following the confirmation of new U.S. tariffs on China.

Pi Network’s native token bucks the bearish trend, surging 250% in a week, with speculation about a Binance listing fueling optimism. Meme coins, including Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Pepe (PEPE), face steep declines as the SEC’s recent statement cast doubt on their utility and increase investor caution. XRP Struggles to Float Above $2 The cryptocurrency market’s collapse has escalated in the past 24 hours, with countless digital assets plunging by double digits. Ripple’s XRP is among the biggest losers, tanking by 10% on a daily scale. It traded slightly above $2 over the past several hours before tanking below that psychological level (according to CoinGecko’s data). XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko While some industry participants believe the bull cycle might be over, some factors suggest that a resurgence is not out of the question. One element that could bring back the green candles is the eventual resolution of the lawsuit between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The case remains ongoing for more than four years after its start, but some important developments signal that its outcome could be just around the corner. For instance, the regulator has recently suspended lawsuits against some crypto entities, including Coinbase , Uniswap , and others. This has caused speculation that the legal battle against Ripple might be the next to be dismissed . Some experts , though, have argued that the complexity of the case might be a hurdle. The popular US lawyer Jeremy Hogan said : “The SEC broke up with Coinbase after a couple of dates. Ripple and the SEC live together and have a baby.” He thinks dismissing the lawsuit against the company is unlikely, forecasting a settlement instead. PI’s First Trading Days Contrary to the bearish environment in the crypto market in the last several days, the native token of Pi Network has charted impressive gains. It has surged by over 250% on a weekly scale , reaching an all-time high of almost $3 on February 27 and currently trading at roughly $2.13. PI Price, Source: CoinGecko Some market observers believe PI’s rally has yet to reach its full potential. They based the prediction on the assumption that Binance is about to list the token on its platform. Not long ago, the biggest crypto exchange held a community vote to determine whether its users would want to see PI available for trading. The results became official on February 27 , with over 86% of the voters clicking the “yes” option. The Memes Bleed Heavily Last but not least , we will touch upon the meme coin niche, which is also deeply covered in red. Leading tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE), and Official Trump (TRUMP) have collapsed by double digits in the past 24 hours alongside the overall market slump. The poor performance comes shortly after the SEC classified most meme coins as non-securities. At the same time, the agency claimed that these tokens “typically have limited or no use or functionality,” warning investors that they sit at the furthest end of the risk spectrum.

This altcoin, priced at just $0.20, has already raised over $44.3 million in its presale phase. With strong investor confidence and a unique asset tokenization model, Rexas Finance is set to challenge established cryptocurrencies. Tokenizing real estate: A revolutionary approach Through Rexas Finance , real estate assets can be tokenized to enhance their general marketability and ease their transmission and purchase. Blockchain has the potential to address inefficiencies within the worldwide real estate market, which holds a value of above $326 trillion. The technology leads to higher marketplace transparency,y which shortens dealing durations while enabling investors from around the world to participate. Institutional financial investors begin to prefer blockchain-based real estate investments because they guarantee security alongside efficiency.

Rexas Finance expands its tokenization operations into three main financial sectors: real estate, stocks and bonds, and commodities. Blockchain adoption finds major potential in markets with a value in excess of $486 trillion. Rexas Finance functions to unite traditional financial procedures with decentralized solutions. The RXS token and presale success The RXS token serves as the foundation of the Rexas Finance ecosystem, offering utility in asset tokenization and DeFi applications. Priced at $0.20 during the presale, the project sold over 441.7 million tokens. This strong demand signals investor confidence and positions RXS for substantial post-launch growth. Token holders benefit from access to exclusive investment opportunities and DeFi services on the Rexas Finance platform. The project’s strategic tokenomics, with a capped supply of 1 billion tokens, ensure scarcity and long-term value appreciation. Analysts predict significant price movement as the token approaches its official exchange listing. Rexas Finance has set its exchange debut for June 19, 2025, with an initial listing price of $0.25. This launch has fueled speculation that RXS could experience exponential growth, similar to early Ethereum trends. Some projections estimate a potential surge to $6.00 or higher in the months following its listing.

Through Rexas Launchpad, users can achieve faultless cross-chain processes which implement blockchain standards like ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155.

AMP price analysis gives a highly bearish prediction of the market trends. The coin value decreased to a $0.00433 level in the last 24 hours. It lost 7.51 percent over the day. The decrease made the market unstable, as the selling pressure is overwhelming. Technical indicators give out a sell signal, and the price charts also depict an unbalanced trading environment. Is AMP a good investment? AMP has been struggling with a bearish trend for the past few months. Despite this, its strong fundamentals suggest it could be a solid long-term investment. Crypto analysts suggest that the approaching weeks can steadily increase the cryptocurrency’s value. A bullish rally may be expected in the latter part of this year (2025), potentially pushing the AMP above $0.0121. Why is AMP down? AMP’s price has decreased today. Additionally, the coin has experienced a substantial loss of 7.51% if observed over the last 24 hours. The price is trading at $0.00433 which is in the average range, moreover, the bears remained on the lead in the past few days. Will AMP reach $0.010? AMP’s resistance level is at $0.008, yet a break above this level is possible if sufficient buying momentum builds. A break near or above $0.010 will require a more robust push but isn’t impossible, as the coin achieved this level on December 3, 2024. What will AMP price target be in 2025? The highest price target for AMP in 2025 is $0.0121. Will AMP ever reach $1? Amp has never spiked above the $0.12 level. Even this price mark was observed only once at the start of the token’s launch, and AMP has never seen this level again. It seems highly unlikely for AMP to achieve $1 soon. Will AMP reach $10? According to the price prediction, AMP will not achieve this level in the next 10 years until something unusual happens. Considering AMP’s current market cap of only $5.7 million, the scenario seems almost impossible. What will AMP be worth in 2030? The highest price of AMP in 2030 is expected to be around $0.00458. Does AMP have a good long-term Future? Amp is trading near its average price level if observed over the longest price period levels. It can be a good long-term investment, as its price is expected to double in 2025 and reach $0.0526 by 2031.

A recent community vote on the exchange saw overwhelming support for the listing, further fueling optimism. Despite a 20% dip in Pi Coin’s price amid a broader crypto market downturn, enthusiasts remain bullish on its long-term growth. Could a Binance listing happen this week? Pi Network Gains Massive Support in Binance Vote Binance recently concluded a community vote on whether to list Pi on its platform. The voting window, which ran from February 17 to February 27, allowed users to express their stance on the matter. The leading exchange engaged the crypto community by stating: “We have been listening to the vibrant discussions within our community about Pi Network. To ensure your voices are heard, participate in our Community Vote on the topic: Should PI be launched on Binance?” The results were decisive. A staggering 86% of the total 294,958 votes supported the listing, while only 14% opposed it. The overwhelming majority has fueled speculations that Binance may soon take action on the matter. If approved, this move could significantly enhance Pi Coin’s credibility and price potential. What’s Next For Pi Network After Binance Vote? While the voting results are positive, Binance has yet to confirm an official listing. Typically, community votes influence decisions but do not guarantee immediate action. Binance follows a thorough due diligence process, evaluating the project’s security, liquidity, and compliance with regulatory frameworks before making a final decision. The Pi team must also ensure that its mainnet operations align with Binance’s listing criteria. The project, which recently launched its mainnet, is still working on key developments. A listing on Binance could push Pi Coin towards wider adoption, but the final decision remains in the hands of the exchange. Why Is This Listing Important? A Binance listing could be a game-changer for Pi Coin. It would expose the token to a global audience, enhancing liquidity and price stability. Historically, top crypto exchange listings have triggered price surges for various cryptocurrencies. If Pi Network secures a spot on Binance, it could see an influx of new investors, potentially driving up its valuation. However, market conditions also play a crucial role. With Pi Coin’s value facing a significant drop today amid a broader crypto market correction , a listing alone may not be enough to reverse its short-term losses. Still, long-term investors view this potential milestone as a catalyst for sustained growth. What’s Next For Pi Coin Price? Pi Coin value today was down nearly 20% and exchanged hands at $2.15 while its one-day trading volume fell 53% to $1.68 billion. However, despite today’s dip, the crypto has added about 230% since last week. Besides, it has also touched its ATH of $2.99 recently, indicating growing market confidence. Having said that, it appears that the recent surge might have caused the current dip in Pi Network’s value. For context, some investors might take the recent surge as an opportunity to book profits. However, despite that, market enthusiasts remain optimistic about the long-term trajectory of the coin. For context, market watcher Max Pavlov recently said that the crypto is likely to target its upper resistance at $3.50 if the bullish momentum holds. But, if the bears dominate, the crypto might slip to $2.05, Pavlov noted. Despite that, with soaring rumors of Binance listing soon, the crypto might see a strong recovery soon. Notably, a recent Pi price analysis hints at a potential rally for the crypto to $5 after the Binance listing.

40957035,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=135368,1740742407,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Upbit’s Bold Stand: Dunamu Defies South Korea’s Crypto Regulations in FIU Lawsuit,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/upbit-dunamu-fiu-lawsuit/,"In a dramatic escalation of tensions between the cryptocurrency industry and regulatory bodies in South Korea, Dunamu, the operator of the popular Upbit crypto exchange, has launched a legal challenge against the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). This move signals a significant pushback against recent regulatory actions and raises critical questions about the future of crypto operations in the nation. Are we witnessing a crucial battle that could reshape the landscape of South Korea crypto regulations ? Why is Dunamu Challenging the FIU? Understanding the Upbit Lawsuit Dunamu’s lawsuit, filed on February 27th with the Seoul Administrative Court, is a direct response to a three-month partial suspension slapped on Upbit by the FIU. But what exactly triggered this drastic action? Let’s break down the key elements of this Upbit lawsuit : The Suspension: The FIU imposed a three-month suspension on specific Upbit operations. While the exact details of these operations haven’t been fully disclosed, it’s understood to impact certain aspects of user transactions, particularly concerning new user crypto transfers. Grounds for Suspension: The FIU cited non-compliance issues as the reason for the suspension. While the specifics remain unclear, it suggests that Upbit may have fallen short of certain regulatory standards set by the Financial Intelligence Unit , potentially related to anti-money laundering (AML) or know-your-customer (KYC) procedures. Dunamu’s Rebuttal: Dunamu is vehemently contesting the suspension, arguing that it is unjust and potentially damaging to their operations and users. The lawsuit seeks two primary outcomes: to overturn the suspension order completely and to secure an immediate halt to its execution while the legal proceedings are underway. Accountability Measures: Adding fuel to the fire, the FIU also held nine Upbit employees accountable, including the CEO. He received a formal reprimand and was removed from his compliance officer role. This demonstrates the FIU’s serious stance and intent to enforce regulatory compliance rigorously. This legal challenge is not just about Upbit; it’s a broader statement about the relationship between crypto exchanges and regulators in South Korea. It highlights the growing pains of a rapidly evolving industry grappling with establishing clear and fair regulatory frameworks. Delving Deeper: The Core Issues in the Dunamu FIU Conflict The heart of the matter lies in the interpretation and enforcement of South Korea crypto regulations . The conflict between Dunamu FIU can be viewed through several critical lenses: Regulatory Clarity vs. Ambiguity: Are the current crypto regulations in South Korea sufficiently clear and unambiguous for exchanges to operate without constant fear of penalties? Exchanges may argue that the rules are often vaguely defined or subject to shifting interpretations, making full compliance a moving target. Regulators, on the other hand, prioritize a cautious approach to protect consumers and the financial system, which can sometimes lead to stringent and perhaps seemingly opaque guidelines. Fairness and Proportionality: Is the three-month suspension a proportionate response to the alleged non-compliance issues? Dunamu likely believes the penalty is excessive and disproportionately impacts their business and users. The FIU, however, probably views the suspension as a necessary measure to deter non-compliance and maintain the integrity of the financial system. Innovation vs. Control: This situation reflects the inherent tension between fostering innovation in the burgeoning crypto space and maintaining regulatory control. Overly strict regulations can stifle innovation and push businesses away, while lax regulations can expose the market to risks. Finding the right balance is the key challenge. Precedent Setting: The outcome of this Upbit lawsuit could set a significant precedent for future regulatory actions and legal challenges in the South Korean crypto market. A win for Dunamu might embolden other exchanges to challenge regulatory decisions, while a loss could strengthen the FIU’s hand and lead to stricter enforcement. What Does This Mean for Upbit Users and the Broader Crypto Market? The crypto exchange suspension imposed on Upbit, and the subsequent lawsuit, have implications that ripple through the entire crypto ecosystem: User Concerns: Upbit users might be concerned about the security and stability of the exchange during this period of uncertainty. While Upbit is challenging the suspension, the situation could create anxiety and potentially impact user confidence. It’s crucial for Upbit to communicate transparently with its users and assure them of continued service within the allowed operational scope. Market Volatility: News of regulatory actions and legal battles can often trigger market volatility in the crypto space. Traders and investors should be prepared for potential fluctuations in the prices of cryptocurrencies, especially those closely associated with Upbit or the South Korean market. Industry-Wide Impact: The outcome of this case will be closely watched by other crypto exchanges in South Korea and globally. It could influence how regulators in other jurisdictions approach crypto regulation and enforcement. A strong regulatory stance in South Korea could signal a global trend towards tighter controls. Long-Term Regulatory Landscape: This legal battle is a crucial step in shaping the long-term regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in South Korea. It underscores the need for ongoing dialogue and collaboration between regulators and industry players to create a framework that fosters innovation while mitigating risks. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Evolving Regulatory Waters For crypto investors, businesses, and enthusiasts, the Dunamu FIU saga offers valuable lessons and actionable insights: Stakeholder Actionable Insight Crypto Investors Stay informed about regulatory developments and their potential impact on your investments. Diversify your holdings across different exchanges and jurisdictions to mitigate risks associated with regulatory actions in a single region. Consider using exchanges with a strong track record of regulatory compliance. Crypto Exchanges Prioritize proactive and robust compliance measures. Engage in open communication with regulators and seek clarity on evolving regulations. Be prepared to adapt your operations to meet regulatory requirements and build trust with both regulators and users. Regulators Strive for clear, consistent, and proportionate regulations that balance innovation and risk mitigation. Engage in dialogue with the crypto industry to understand the nuances of the technology and its potential benefits. Foster a regulatory environment that encourages responsible innovation and protects consumers without stifling growth. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for South Korea’s Crypto Future The Upbit lawsuit filed by Dunamu against the FIU represents more than just a legal dispute; it’s a pivotal moment in the evolution of South Korea crypto regulations . This clash highlights the ongoing struggle to define the boundaries of regulatory oversight in the rapidly expanding world of cryptocurrencies. The outcome of this legal battle will undoubtedly have far-reaching consequences, shaping the future of crypto operations in South Korea and potentially influencing regulatory approaches globally. As the legal proceedings unfold, the crypto community will be watching closely, hoping for a resolution that fosters both innovation and responsible growth within a clear and equitable regulatory framework.

40957258,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/02/dogecoin-price-prediction-will-this-competitor-take-doges-crown,1740742786,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/40957258.jpeg,Dogecoin Price Prediction: Will This Competitor Take Doge’s Crown?,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/02/dogecoin-price-prediction-will-this-competitor-take-doges-crown,"Dogecoin Price Prediction is on the minds of many, but here’s the twist: while Dogecoin has had its time in the spotlight, a new contender is rising fast, Dawgz AI. Personally, I’ve seen how $DAGZ has been outperforming expectations with its AI-powered trading bots, offering insane returns for investors. Whether you’re looking for a triple-double ROI or simply want to fund Ethereum's booming ecosystem, Dawgz AI is the smarter, more profitable choice right now. So, could Dawgz AI steal Doge’s crown? With its innovative technology and rapid growth, it’s certainly making waves. Dawgz AI vs. Dogecoin: A Battle for the Crown When it comes to meme coins, Dogecoin has led the pack. It has a huge fan base and has garnered attention from investors and celebrities alike. However, despite all of its popularity, the Dogecoin doge price prediction has been somewhat volatile and lacking in real utility. This is where $DAGZ comes into play. Dawgz AI isn’t just about fun, it’s about profitability. With its AI-powered trading bots running 24/7, it takes advantage of the market's ups and downs to maximize returns. Unlike Dogecoin, which relies mainly on community support and social media hype, Dawgz AI offers a solid foundation for growth through technology, smart trading, and rewards. The Power of AI-Powered Trading: Dawgz AI’s Secret Weapon One of the most exciting characteristics of Dawgz AI is its AI-driven trading bots. The bots work around the clock, executing trades automatically to take advantage of market fluctuations. This means you don’t have to manually track the market capitalization or rely on price prediction based on technical analysis alone. Unlike Dogecoin, whose peak price prediction relies on market sentiment and social trends, $DAGZ uses AI to make data-driven decisions that can lead to better, more consistent returns. Imagine not needing to check the current Dogecoin price every few hours because you know your investments are being handled efficiently 24/7. Here’s how it works: AI-powered trading bots analyze real-time data. They make quick trades, capitalizing on even the smallest market movements. This system is built to adapt, ensuring you can keep up with the fast-paced crypto marketplace. While Dogecoin has certainly made a name for itself, its average price action is often subject to celebrity tweets and memes. Dawgz AI, on the other hand, is driven by cutting-edge technology that aims for long-term gains rather than short-term hype. Staking Rewards: Earning While You Hold One thing Dawgz AI offers that Dogecoin doesn't is the ability to earn staking rewards. If you hold Ethereum (ETH), Dawgz AI allows you to stake your tokens and earn passive income with competitive APY. This feature alone can make a significant difference for investors who want to increase their holdings while waiting for dogecoin doge prices to rise. Here’s how staking rewards work: Staking allows you to earn rewards by holding tokens in a secure wallet. The higher your staked amount, the better your rewards. It’s a way to make your crypto work for you, while other coins, like Dogecoin, don’t offer similar passive income opportunities. In the case of Dawgz AI , this is just another way to capitalize on its growing momentum without having to rely solely on Dogecoin DOGE price to increase. Dawgz AI’s Presale Momentum: The Road to Growth Another standout feature of Dawgz AI is its presale momentum. Already raising over $2 million, $DAGZ is set for massive growth with its next milestone target of $2.1 million. As more people get on board, there’s an expected increase in the highest price prediction for Dawgz AI. This presale success is a clear sign that Dawgz AI is growing in popularity and attracting investors. Unlike Dogecoin, which started as a meme with little initial backing, Dawgz AI has already shown its strength in the market with over $2 million raised in presale funding. As more investors hop on board, the demand for Dawgz AI is only expected to rise, pushing its market capitalization up and driving Dogecoin prices to increase. https://www.youtube.com/embed/acaQLeIKyyA?si=-1Yb34MxKB4DBJPX "" title=""YouTube video player"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"" referrerpolicy=""strict-origin-when-cross-origin"" allowfullscreen> Strong Tokenomics: A Sustainable and Profitable Future When it comes to cryptocurrency, tokenomics is key to understanding long-term sustainability. With a total stock of 8.888 billion coins, Dawgz AI has a well-planned distribution to ensure stability. Here’s how it breaks down: 30% goes to the presale, allowing early investors to benefit. 20% is reserved for staking rewards, encouraging users to hold and stake their tokens. 10% is allocated to liquidity, ensuring smooth market operations. This structured tokenomics is crucial for maintaining a solid market cap and supporting the long-term success of Dawgz AI. Compared to Dogecoin, which has an unlimited supply and fluctuating demand, Dawgz AI has carefully planned its distribution to ensure its average price remains stable and valuable. In contrast, Dogecoin’s price has faced challenges with its massive supply, leading to inflation and wild minimum price swings. Dawgz AI’s focused approach to tokenomics gives it a much more sustainable growth trajectory. Meme Coin with Utility: The Best of Both Worlds It’s no secret that Dogecoin started as a joke, and while it has grown significantly, it’s still primarily a meme coin without much underlying utility. On the other hand, Dawgz AI combines the fun of meme coins with the utility of advanced AI-powered trading. By offering real AI-driven trading and staking rewards, Dawgz AI adds tangible value to its holders. Unlike Dogecoin, which primarily benefits from social media hype and investor sentiment, Dawgz AI gives its users something more substantial: a way to earn passive income while enjoying the fun of meme coin culture. This combination of fun and profitability makes Dawgz AI the more attractive investment for those who want to benefit from the meme coin trend while still gaining real-world value. Conclusion Looking at the Dogecoin price prediction 2025, it’s clear that Dawgz Ai has the potential to give Dogecoin a serious challenge. While Dogecoin continues to be a favorite in the meme coin world, its reliance on social sentiment and limited utility might leave it vulnerable to competitors like Dawgz AI. With Dawgz AI ’s focus on long-term sustainability, cutting-edge technology, and tangible rewards. It’s well-positioned to potentially take Dogecoin’s crown and offer investors a more profitable alternative in the ever-evolving world of meme coins. Dawgz AI could be the one to watch as we look ahead to the future of Dogecoin DOGE and its competitors. Frequently Asked Questions What is the Dogecoin prediction for 2025? The Dogecoin forecast for 2025 remains uncertain, with many market analysts predicting moderate maximum price increases. However, Dawgz AI stands as a more promising investment for 2025. Unlike Doge price prediction, driven by social media and hype, Dawgz AI has strong tokenomics and AI-powered trading, giving it the potential to consistently outperform dogecoin DOGE price over the long term. Can DOGE reach $10? Reaching $10 seems unlikely based on DOGE price prediction history and its minimum price action. Many people think that the Dogecoin price prediction 2030 with reach $10, but not the Dogecoin 2025 price prediction. The maximum value for Dogecoin would require massive market shifts and sustained adoption. Dawgz AI, on the other hand, has a much more achievable roadmap, focusing on AI-driven growth, staking rewards, and presale momentum, positioning it for exponential growth in a way Dogecoin cannot. How much is $500 worth of Dogecoin right now? The current price of Dogecoin fluctuates, but with $500, you can get a significant amount based on the current DOGE price. The price prediction for dogecoin of $500 is a great amount, but the Dogecoin price prediction 5 years can be a smaller amount. However, Dawgz AI offers more potential with its AI-powered trading bots and staking rewards, turning your investments into passive income while Dogecoin's price struggles to maintain a stable increase. Is Dogecoin projected to skyrocket? While there may be short-term price increases in DOGE price forecast, it's unlikely to experience a sustained skyrocket in minimum and maximum prices. Dawgz AI is a more strategic investment, leveraging AI-driven trading volume, staking, and strong tokenomics to provide more consistent returns. It’s a smarter choice if you’re looking for long-term gains rather than the unpredictable lowest price motion of Dogecoin.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) continues to remain one of the best picks because of its momentum driven by the community. Still, three other coins could be just as profitable: Rexas Finance (RXS), Cardano (ADA), and Dogecoin (DOGE). RXS is revolutionizing asset tokenization, ADA continues its development in blockchain scalability, and DOGE thrives on strong adoption. By strategically holding these coins, investors can maximize their returns during the upcoming market surge. Rexas Finance (RXS): A High-Growth Asset for the 2025 Bull Run Certain investors stay on standby and exercise caution to see how the market develops since a crypto bull run appears soon. Following Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) path, which leads in the meme coin sector, Rexas Finance (RXS) is gaining fame due to its real-world asset tokenization. Rexas Finance is currently undergoing the last phase of its token presale, and approximately 90% of the tokens have been purchased. The presale has successfully raised over $45.89 million. The estimated time for the token to go public is June 19th, 2025, at an initial value of $0.25 per token. Rexas Finance could benefit from strong post-listing demand. Unlike SHIB, which depends on speculative hype, RXS has garnered support from an extensive utility-diversified ecosystem enabling fractional real estate ownership, art, commodities, and more. Why Hold RXS for the Next 7 Months? Presale-to-Launch Growth: With a presale price of $0.20, RXS is expected to be valued at $0.25 at launch, with additional upside potential as more investors recognize its value. Real-World Use Cases: Unlike SHIB, which is largely transactional, RXS provides investment access to high-value assets through blockchain-based tokenization. Yield and Passive Income Opportunities: Investors can stake RXS tokens, which gives them passive income while having more reasons to hold the investment long-term. Market Outlook: Rexas Finance appeals to investors looking for real investments, while Shiba Inu intrigues speculative traders. With the upcoming launch and strong presale activity, Rexas Finance is positioned for long-term growth. Thus, RXS should be held alongside SHIB and other leading cryptocurrencies. Shiba Inu(SHIB) Whales Signal Imminent Rally There has been a massive transfer worth over $26 million of Shibu Inu (SHIB) in the past 24 hours, indicating a rise in whale activity, which is a positive sign of interest from the investors. Along with the increased activity from whales, the ecosystem’s growth is also a sign of an unprecedented price hike for SHIB. Despite a generally bearish outlook in the altcoin market, the on-chain data suggests that SHIB could reclaim its 30-day high of $0.00002488. Moreover, the possibility of SHIB Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) applications being filed could attract institutional investment, further fueling a rally. Holding SHIB for at least another seven months could maximize potential gains during this anticipated bull run. Dogecoin(DOGE) Bullish Outlook For Long-Term Holders According to the analysis from BlockchainReporter.net, Dogecoin (DOGE) is showing signs of a potential bull run, which could be beneficial for investors holding for the long term. As of February 11, 2025, DOGE is trading in a consolidation range and may have bullish momentum in the future based on technical indicators such as MACD. If DOGE sustains within the support zone of $0.248-$0.255 and breaks the resistance of $0.262-$0.265, the coin can easily outperform its recent highs towards the target range of $0.268-$0.275. This scenario aligns with the HOLD strategy for DOGE and would require an investor to wait for at least another seven months. This would maximize gains, as the market will start to enter a bull run alongside other promising coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB). Cardano(ADA) Breakout: Aiming for $1.11 Cardano (ADA) recently broke out of a major resistance level at $0.80, suggesting that a bullish falling wedge was forming and has now been broken. Technical indicators like MACD and DMI suggest a bullish momentum increase, which could result in further gains. Should this trend continue, ADA might target a 40% increase to reach $1.11. However, if the momentum wanes, a retreat could see ADA testing support at $0.16. This situation positions ADA as a candidate for investment if one plans to hold for at least another seven months to capitalize on a possible extended bull run. Conclusion With the market poised for another breakout, patience is key. Rexas Finance , Cardano, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu each present compelling reasons to hold, whether through innovation, real-world utility, or strong market sentiment. RXS, in particular, stands out with its asset-backed model and imminent launch, while ADA and DOGE continue to maintain relevance. These coins could deliver impressive gains as the next few months unfold, making them top picks for long-term investors.

The latest duties, announced suddenly on Friday via Truth Social as per usual, will take effect on March 4. China’s Ministry of Commerce responded within hours, warning that it will take “all necessary measures” to protect its economy. “If the US insists on having its own way, China will counter with all necessary measures to defend its legitimate rights and interests,” a Ministry of Commerce spokesperson said, per a report from Bloomberg News. The statement follows Beijing’s past commitment to take “corresponding steps” in response to Washington’s economic measures. Markets take a hit as investors react The market reaction was immediate. Hong Kong-listed Chinese stocks plunged 3.9% Friday morning, which is their worst single-day loss since October. The CSI 300 Index, which tracks the largest companies on the mainland, dropped 1.9%, ending its longest winning streak in a month. The offshore yuan briefly fell overnight before recovering 0.1% to 7.29 per dollar, as the People’s Bank of China stepped in to stabilize the currency, per data from MarketWatch. Bond yields across China also slumped as economic concerns grew. Investors, already on edge about Trump’s trade policies, reacted to the sudden tariff announcement by moving funds into safer assets. The People’s Bank of China has been working to support the financial system, but rising borrowing costs and tightening liquidity have raised concerns about economic stability. The timing of the tariffs adds a lot of pressure on China’s President Xi Jinping as the duties will go into effect just one day before Xi and his top officials gather for the National People’s Congress, the most important political meeting of the year. There, his government will unveil its economic blueprint for 2025, outlining key policies on trade, domestic growth, and financial stability. While the tariffs won’t force a change in China’s official economic targets, they could dampen sentiment. At a Friday meeting, Xi and his Politburo talked about the need to expand domestic demand and stabilize financial markets—two topics that are expected to dominate discussions next week. Despite escalating tensions, Xi has urged his team to remain calm, likely due to the fact that he and Trump like each other a lot and have said so on many occasions. The Chinese leader has yet to speak with Trump since his return to office, even though the US president has repeatedly said that a conversation is expected soon. But high-level talks between Chinese and American officials continue behind the scenes. Vice Premier He Lifeng met with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent last week in what was the second major dialogue since Trump’s inauguration. China’s Defense Ministry also confirmed that discussions with the US military are in the works. China’s countermeasures: Trade war tools ready China has a long history of striking back when tariffs take effect. In the last round of trade tensions, Beijing responded within seconds of Washington’s new duties kicking in. The measures included additional tariffs on US goods, an antitrust investigation into Google , and new restrictions on critical mineral exports that the US relies on. China also blacklisted major American companies, preventing them from doing business in the country. A similar response is expected this time, according to JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs economists. One major tool at China’s disposal is the suspension of US tariff waivers, which coincidentally expire today. These waivers have allowed certain US imports to enter China without facing retaliatory tariffs. While Beijing has previously extended these waivers, it has yet to announce an extension this time—strongly suggesting that they will be left to expire. The Trump administration is also tightening restrictions on China beyond tariffs. Over the past two weeks, Washington has announced new investment curbs, proposed shipping fees for goods transported on Chinese-made vessels, and has been pressuring Mexico to also impose tariffs on Chinese imports. For Americans and American businesses, the effect of the tariffs will be felt quickly. China remains the largest US trading partner on a single-country basis, and new duties mean higher costs for importers. The US Federal Reserve actually reported in January that official trade data underestimates how much the US actually imports from China. That means the actual price impact of these tariffs could be far worse than expected. Meanwhile, China’s financial system is facing its own set of challenges. The People’s Bank of China has been actively supporting the yuan, prioritizing currency stability over aggressive monetary easing. However, that decision has led to a liquidity crunch, with short-term borrowing costs surging. The yield on one-year AAA-rated negotiable certificates of deposit, a key funding instrument for banks, jumped past 2% this week—the highest since June. The central bank’s reluctance to inject more liquidity has driven borrowing costs even higher. The rate on one-year medium-term lending facility loans—the People’s Bank of China’s key policy tool—was surpassed for the first time since October, thanks to a tightening credit environment.

A report by TheMinerMag shows that mining revenue held steady at approximately $1.4 billion in January. However, industry dynamics are shifting, with network hashrates fluctuating and public mining companies facing operational challenges. Bitcoin’s network activity reached 780 exahashes per second (EH/s) in January, following sustained growth from 642 EH/s in September to 779 EH/s by December.

The price of THORChain (RUNE) changed hands around $1.20, dipping sharply after hitting highs above $1.60. RUNE faced rejection at the resistance level that has previously proved tough for bulls on multiple occasions year-to-date. Notably, the dump from highs of $1.63 for RUNE coincides with the sharp sell-off that sent Bitcoin (BTC) below $80,000 early Friday. However, the THORChain network was also seeing increased chatter as one of its top developers announced an exit. What is THORChain? THORChain is a decentralised exchange providing for native Bitcoin (BTC) cross-chain swaps. Its decentralised finance infrastructure is available across several blockchain networks. Meanwhile, its cross-chain asset rails and liquidity are accessible for industry players including Trust, Ledger, OKX, and Bitget. As the platform allows for anonymous cross-chain swaps, it brings to the fore benefits of decentralization in liquidity management. However, there are concerns that threat actors are misusing these platforms. This has resulted in considerable discussions around crypto crime an what can be done. Chainflip, for instance, instituted an upgrade to block blacklisted addresses following the $1.4 billion Bybit hack. RUNE price falls as THORChain developer Pluto exits On February 27, THORChain developer Pluto announced he was leaving the DEX protocol. While he did not expound on the reason for his exit, it comes amid significant chatter around hackers’ use of the platform. In particular, the North Korean-backed Lazarus Group has used THORChain to launder huge sums of its $1.4 billion Bybit hack funds. Pluto (9R) @Pluto9r · Follow **Moving on from THORChain**Validators, developers, members of the community: effectively immediately, I will no longer be contributing to THORChain.

It has… 7:33 pm · 27 Feb 2025 343 Reply Copy link Read 87 replies Pluto, who had worked with the THORChain for four years, reportedly left after a failed attempt to block the hacker’s transactions. The developer had supported efforts to prevent illicit funds flowing through the platform. “TCB”, a THORChain validator, confirmed this via X. “As I mentioned yesterday, I will also see myself out if we don’t rapidly adopt a solution to stop NK flows, so this will likely be one of my last posts on the TC subject,” TCB noted . North Korea-backed Lazarus Group exploited a vulnerability with the Safe wallet to loot over 400k Ether (ETH) from Bybit. While the laundering that followed used platforms such as eXch and Chainflip, a significant amount of the swaps to BTC happened on THORChain. Blockchain intelligence and analytics platform Arkham noted that as of February 27, the hackers had laundered more than $240 million via THORChain. Arkham @arkham · Follow ALERT: LAZARUS LAUNDERING THROUGH THORCHAIN – MINIMUM $240M SO FAROver $240M of ETH has been sent through Thorchain by Lazarus-tagged wallets on Arkham.These funds have mainly been swapped for native BTC. 11:49 pm · 27 Feb 2025 1.0K Reply Copy link Read 88 replies These transactions helped boost transaction volume on THORChain.

And it’s showing in the markets. Most top coins are struggling to find their footing, but Solana is slowly changing this momentum. After taking a 20% hit, SOL has bounced back with a 3.5% gain just in the last day. That said, anyone who’s used Solana knows the network still gets bogged down during high traffic – a problem that’s been around for years. That’s where Solaxy ($SOLX) may help. This new Layer-2 project is designed to take some of the load off Solana’s main chain. The crypto community seems to see the potential here – they’ve already poured $24M into the presale, which says a lot about the confidence in this solution. Visit the Solaxy ($SOLX) presale now Solana’s Resurgence in 2025 – Can It Overcome Past Struggles? As 2025 unfolds, Solana’s journey through the crypto market has been anything but dull. Bullish sentiment closed last year, but 2025 began with uncertainty. Despite a drop from $250, there’s a reason for optimism. SOL currently trades around $138. It climbed from recent lows and found its way to a positive zero-ground in the environment that still struggles to find the right direction. While it remains well below its all-time high of $260 from November 2021, it’s far from the $8 lows of 2022. Beyond price action, the network expands further. Institutional players support its growth as Franklin Templeton files for a Solana-based ETF, which signals rising mainstream interest. The network wants to strengthen its infrastructure with upgrades that boost validator performance and ease network strain. Still, congestion remains its Achilles’ heel. A surge of Trump-themed projects in January once again tested the network’s limits, caused transaction delays, and led to failed swaps. It’s clear that Solana needs solutions to sustain momentum. And that’s exactly what innovations like Solaxy ($SOLX) want to address. Visit the Solaxy ($SOLX) presale now Solaxy’s Layer-2 Solution Could Be the Key to Solana’s Future Solana’s biggest advantages—speed and low fees—often take a hit when demand surges. Heavy traffic can slow transactions, cause failures, and disrupt everything from DeFi platforms to NFT marketplaces. Solaxy ($SOLX) introduces a new approach to Solana’s scalability as the first Layer-2 meme coin designed to keep the network congestion-free . Instead of acting as a mere fix, Solaxy provides real value and cultivates an engaged community. This approach makes transactions faster and cheaper and puts Solaxy on the forefront of the best crypto presales in 2025. At the same time, it reduces pressure on Solana’s main network and makes sure that users get a seamless experience even when activity spikes. Visit the Solaxy ($SOLX) presale now Regardless of a weak market, this ICO held its position and secured $24 million before launch, while others struggled to gain support. Moreover, it blends the best of Ethereum and Solana and offers a multi-chain framework that delivers unmatched speed, reliability, and security. This next-gen approach might make it a critical part of Solana’s future. At the heart of Solaxy’s ecosystem is the $SOLX token. Early adopters can get in at just $0.001648, with staking rewards surpassing 170% APY. Solaxy stakers can access their tokens a week after the project goes live or extend their stake for three years to earn even more. As $SOLX continues to attract close to $1 million weekly, the presale offers a rare chance to lock in tokens at the lowest possible price. Visit the Solaxy ($SOLX) presale now Crypto Influencer Says Solaxy Could 50x in 2025 – The Best Presale to Buy Right Now? Crypto influencer Borch is hyped about Solaxy, calling it the best presale to get into right now—he even thinks it could be 50x in 2025. In a recent video, he explained to his viewers why Solaxy could be a game-changer for the Solana ecosystem. It’s launching the first-ever layer 2 blockchain for Solana, designed to fix one of its biggest problems: network congestion. Whenever Solana gets overloaded with activity, transactions slow down or fail altogether. Solaxy plans to solve that with off-chain computation and transaction bundling, making transactions faster, cheaper, and way more reliable. Borch Crypto even said, “These guys are building it to withstand any amount of transactions per second.” On top of that, the project has a solid roadmap, with centralized exchange listings and the launch of its layer 2 blockchain coming soon. Visit the Solaxy ($SOLX) presale now Final Words Solana’s journey has been filled with challenges, yet it remains one of the most promising blockchains. More institutions embrace it, and developers expand its ecosystem, but congestion still delays progress. Solaxy ($SOLX) is a new presale that provides a real solution. With nearly $24 million raised in presale, the market recognizes its potential in solving Solana’s scalability concerns, while ensuring high returns as one of the best meme coin presales in Q1 2025.

As the flag bearer crypto plows on, XRP at $2.03 is stuck, with whales’ sell-offs hindering its rise. In another twist, a fresh Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is booming with a huge $16 value target. The recently launched DeFi token is getting plenty of attention as it navigates the second phase of presale. In just a matter of days, the presale has raised over $1.8 million in financing and attracted over $1.8 million in investors. The investors have just a short while to purchase tokens for $0.015 as the price rises 33.33% to $0.02 in the next phase. People who are participating in Phase 2 can earn a possible return on investment of 300%, with launch price being $0.06. As utility tokens come into focus, Mutuum Finance could reach $16 surpassing BTC and XRP in growth. Mutuum Finance: The Future of Decentralized Lending Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing DeFi lending with its dual-lending structure, merged Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) structures. On the P2C model, users hold stablecoins like USDT in pools of loans, while users get access to crypto-backed loans utilizing assets like ETH. In the P2P model, the middlemen are cut out, and lenders and borrowers agree on terms directly. The hybrid setup offers increased security, flexibility, and profitability and has liquidity providers making as much as 10% APY. By cutting out middlemen, Mutuum Finance is cost-saving on borrowing costs and rewarding liquidity providers better. With second-by-second transactions, absolute transparency, and user-first orientation, it’s revolutionizing the benchmark in decentralized finance. Security, Stability & Long-Term Growth Security is its highest priority to Mutuum Finance. The platform is undergoing third-party audits, has open-source smart contracts, and is set to release a fully collateralized USD-pegged stablecoin to provide price stability. In addition, there is a buyback program that is maintained through fees on the platform to ensure long-term token value. Attracting retail and institutional investors alike, Mutuum Finance is a secure, high-yielding DeFi investment with good risk management and a robust lending model. The rate of the project’s expansion is a reflection of the venture’s popularity, with over 3,400 investors already on board. A Prime Opportunity for Early Investors Mutuum Finance is currently in Phase 2 of its presale, where investors can buy MUTM tokens for as low as $0.015 before the price rises gradually over 11 phases to $0.06 at launch. Early investors can potentially make a 300% return before the token even reaches major exchanges. Experts are predicting MUTM could surge over $5 after launch, making it one of the most anticipated DeFi tokens of 2025. Investors who got in during Phase 1 already have a 50% return, and presale has already hit over $1.8 million. To encourage adoption and reward early adopters, Mutuum Finance is giving away $100,000 in MUTM tokens. Ten winners will each receive $10,000, and the referral program rewards users who refer new investors with additional incentives, further expanding the community even quicker. Mutuum Finance is rapidly emerging as one of the most prominent players in the DeFi market, offering an innovative lending mechanism, solid security, and excellent early progress. As Bitcoin breaks to $148,000 and XRP is subject to selling pressure, MUTM presale is providing investors with a chance to buy in early at a price of just $0.015, before the price jumps to $0.06 on launch. The profit margin is tremendous with a forecasted target of $16.

According to Dune Analytics , the protocol’s daily trading revenue has plunged by 96.8%, dropping from its $1 million peak on January 2 to under $35,000 as of February 27. The Base network’s virtual app revenue has been particularly weak, generating less than $1,000 per day for 10 consecutive days—a stark contrast to its $859,000 daily high on October 27, 2024. Virtuals Protocol Records $28K on Base, Just $6K on Solana in Daily Revenue On February 27, Virtuals recorded $28,492 in revenue from Base and just $6,300 from Solana. Meanwhile, the number of new AI agents created on the platform has remained below 10 per day for the past 10 days. Initially launched on Base, Virtuals Protocol gained attention for its AI agents, which can manage crypto wallets and tip social media users to boost engagement. The project’s expansion to Solana on January 25 was seen as an opportunity to tap into a thriving ecosystem. However, Solana’s reputation has taken a hit in recent weeks due to a wave of failed presidential meme coins and increasing concerns over scams on the network. Currently, about 170,000 unique wallets hold Virtuals agents’ tokens on Base, compared to just 11,000 on Solana. Overall wallet activity has also declined, with only 7,642 wallets trading at least one token on February 27. Notably, Virtuals Protocol’s native token has fallen over 14% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. The drop coincides with Bitcoin’s 20% decline over the past week, as global trade tensions continue to weigh on the broader crypto market.

Once ranked 68th by market capitalization, it has now slipped to the 92nd spot, signaling a fading interest in the AI-powered platform. Coinbase Completes First AI-to-AI Crypto Transaction Between Bots In August, Coinbase conducted its first AI-to-AI crypto transaction between two bots. At the time, CEO Armstrong said that a large language model (LLM) successfully used crypto tokens to purchase AI tokens from another AI bot. While AI bots cannot possess traditional bank accounts, they can own cryptocurrency wallets, enabling them to conduct transactions with humans, businesses, and other AI entities. Armstrong highlighted the efficiency of these transactions, emphasizing their “instant, global, and fee-free” nature. However, Armstrong acknowledged the current limitations of AI agents. Despite advancements, AI agents often struggle to complete tasks independently, hindered by technological constraints and the inability to acquire necessary resources. For instance, an AI agent cannot book a flight ticket without a payment method. Armstrong envisions a future where AI agents can overcome these limitations, leading to significant advancements. He believes that AI-powered transactions could revolutionize industries, particularly e-commerce, by enabling AI-driven checkout processes. Other industry experts also predict that AI bots could soon become the dominant force in blockchain transactions.

Is this the time to buy $ETH and $SOL? What about $BNB? Bulls simply must step in and save the day for $ETH Source: TradingView The $ETH price is at the bottom, of that there can be no doubt. Could it still plunge down through the last major support and the ascending bull market trendline? Yes, anything is possible. However, if Ethereum is to continue as the leading layer 1 blockchain, and crypto is to remain a viable asset class, this last line in the sand really needs to hold. These are strong words, but falling through this last ditch defence and confirming below would probably put the kibosh on this current bull market. There are support levels at $1,900 and at $1,700, but this is just for what it’s worth. The bulls simply must come in and save the day at the current price level. A bounce for $SOL from major support? Source: TradingView For the price of $SOL, things could be considered to be even worse. $SOL has crashed through its bull market trendline by a country mile, and is now at a band of support that simply must hold. Within this band of support lies the 0.618 Fibonacci, drawn for the entire bull market. Therefore, a bounce from here would make a lot of sense. At the bottom of the chart is the Stochastic RSI, showing that the indicator lines have bottomed, ready to cross back up again and bring much needed upside price momentum back into the market. $BNB holding up really well Source: TradingView Finally, if one looks at the weekly chart for $BNB, we see a cryptocurrency that is actually holding up really well. Only having dropped 36% in total from the high, this looks great in comparison with its layer 1 competitors. In fact, the current price level is only 27% down from the high. The ascending trendline below is still nicely intact, and major support looks to have been found at $503. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI indicator lines do look as though they might get rejected from the 20.00 level, but the weekend will either confirm or deny this. It is often said that those cryptocurrencies that hold up the best during correctional phases are often those that bounce the highest once the trend turns around.

Rumors are swirling that XYZVerse might soon eclipse popular tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. With predictions of a significant surge on the horizon, anticipation is building to see if XYZVerse will redefine the landscape of digital assets. XYZVerse: The Best New Meme Project You Can’t Afford to Bench! XYZ is your exclusive VIP pass to a sports-driven, meme-fueled revolution. Think of it as the MVP of the XYZVerse ecosystem, where crypto enthusiasts can score big off the growing demand for meme coins. But every revolution needs a hero—someone willing to fight against the odds and push the $XYZ token to the top. That hero is XYZepe , the masked fighter, the true believer, the relentless $XYZ holder whose mission is to bring XYZVerse to the #1 spot on CoinMarketCap. It’s about proving that underdogs can rise to greatness. With millions of sports fans ready to hit the field, the XYZVerse ecosystem is set to keep expanding—and your rewards will slam dunk through the roof! And here’s a highlight reel moment: XYZVerse has been officially recognized as the Best NEW Meme Project—a title that underscores its explosive potential in the meme coin arena. XYZ presale is your first-quarter chance to get in before the mind-blowing explosion! Meme coins are the undisputed champions of the crypto world, and XYZ is set to crush the competition. Currently priced at $0.0025, $XYZ remains an undervalued crypto gem poised to rise to $0.1 at the final presale stage. But victory doesn’t happen overnight—it takes dedication, strategy, and a fighter willing to go the distance. XYZepe knows the battle ahead, but with the community behind him, he’s taking $XYZ to legendary status. With upcoming listings on major CEX and DEX platforms, rock-solid defense in the form of audited smart contracts, and a fully vetted team, XYZ is already ahead of the game. The first-mover advantage is key here—get in before the crowd storms the field, and you’ll be sitting on way bigger returns! XYZepe is fighting for glory—will you stand with him? Dogecoin Unleashed: The Shiba Inu Meme Coin That’s No Joke Dogecoin began in 2013 as a light-hearted alternative to serious cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. With its Shiba Inu dog logo and playful style, it was created as a joke by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer. Unlike Bitcoin’s limited supply, Dogecoin was designed to be plentiful, with 10,000 new coins mined every minute and no maximum cap. This abundance made it accessible and fun, quickly attracting a loyal community. It showcased the power of internet culture and memes in shaping new forms of digital money. In 2021, Dogecoin’s value surged, fueled by social media buzz and endorsements from figures like Elon Musk. It soared into the top ten cryptocurrencies, with a market cap exceeding $50 billion. While it started as a meme, Dogecoin’s technology offers fast and low-cost transactions, making it useful for tipping and small payments. In the current market, its strong community support and high visibility make it an intriguing option. As crypto trends evolve, Dogecoin exemplifies how community and humor can drive serious market movements, turning a joke into a significant player in the crypto world. Shiba Inu: The Memecoin with Big Ambitions on Ethereum Shiba Inu (SHIB) is more than a meme; it’s a cryptocurrency that started as a playful nod to Dogecoin but has grown with serious goals. Launched in August 2020 by the anonymous Ryoshi, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain, tapping into its vast ecosystem. Initially, one quadrillion tokens were created, and half were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. He donated a significant portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, boosting SHIB’s profile and showing a commitment to community causes. What sets SHIB apart is its use of Ethereum, allowing for projects like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange. Plans for an NFT platform and a governance system run by a DAO highlight its potential for real utility. In the current market, memecoins are grabbing attention, but SHIB’s technological backbone gives it an edge over others like Dogecoin, which doesn’t have Ethereum compatibility. As the crypto world evolves, SHIB’s focus on decentralized apps and community governance could make it an attractive option for those looking beyond just the hype. Conclusion While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have strong communities, XYZVerse aims for 20,000% growth by uniting sports fans, positioning itself to outperform its predecessors in the current bull run.

What’s Happening?,https://timestabloid.com/cardano-whales-accumulate-over-130-million-ada-in-72-hours-whats-happening/,"Over the past 72 hours, large-scale investors, commonly called whales have accumulated more than 130 million Cardano (ADA) tokens. This significant buying activity highlights the growing confidence of institutional and high-net-worth investors in Cardano’s long-term potential. Whale accumulation is often seen as an indicator of bullish sentiment, as these investors typically have access to extensive market research and insights that influence their decisions. The timing of this accumulation suggests that whales are positioning themselves for potential price appreciation in the coming months. Impact on Market Dynamics and ADA Price Movements The influx of whale purchases has had a noticeable impact on Cardano’s market performance. Over the past week, ADA’s price has surged by approximately 21%, demonstrating renewed market enthusiasm following a period of volatility. At the time of writing, ADA is trading at $0.584319, marking a slight 0.12% decline from the previous close, but still showing resilience in a fluctuating market. The intraday price has ranged between a high of $0.678797 and a low of $0.582422, suggesting that the recent accumulation phase has contributed to stabilizing the asset’s price while fueling buying momentum. Over the past 72 hours, whales bought more than 130 million #Cardano $ADA ! pic.twitter.com/1L6pCFaKvJ — Ali (@ali_charts) February 28, 2025 Historically, whale activity tends to precede major price movements. Whale investors accumulate large positions when market sentiment is low, often leading to supply shocks that drive prices higher. Given ADA’s recent trading patterns, this accumulation phase could signal the beginning of a more extended bullish trend if retail investors follow suit. Cardano’s Growing Ecosystem and Institutional Interest The whale accumulation aligns with Cardano’s ongoing network developments and increasing adoption across various sectors. The blockchain continues to expand its capabilities, particularly in decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and smart contracts. With the successful implementation of the Alonzo upgrade and ongoing improvements in Cardano’s scalability and efficiency, the network is becoming a more attractive option for developers and investors alike. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Institutional interest in Cardano has also increased, with major financial entities exploring its potential as a sustainable and scalable blockchain solution. The network’s proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which is significantly more energy-efficient than proof-of-work (PoW) alternatives, has made it a favorable option for institutions seeking environmentally friendly blockchain investments. The recent whale activity could indicate that institutional investors are increasing their exposure to ADA in anticipation of future growth. What’s Next for ADA? Whales’ accumulation of over 130 million ADA tokens signals that high-value investors see potential in Cardano’s future. This strategic buying spree will stabilize ADA’s price and set the stage for potential upward momentum. As the blockchain continues to innovate and expand, and as institutional adoption grows, ADA could experience further gains in the near term. Investors will closely watch price movements and broader market trends to assess whether this whale accumulation will translate into sustained bullish momentum.

Though the debate continues, some have pointed to a $1.50 Cardano price prediction by the end of 2025. Meanwhile, in meme coins, Panshibi (SHIBI) has been highlighted as a frontrunner with major growth potential. With SHIBI gaining momentum, is ADA still worth holding, or is it time to jump ship? Cardano Price Prediction: $1.50 By Late 2025? Cardano (ADA) is shaping up to be a solid long-term investment as it continues to build out its ecosystem with major technical upgrades. Currently trading at $0.663, ADA has been holding steady, largely due to its strong community support and decentralized holder distribution. Unlike other cryptocurrencies that whales heavily influence, 91.52% of ADA’s supply is held by retail investors, while whales account for just 8.48%. This means ADA is less prone to extreme volatility, making it a safer bet for those looking at long-term growth. Cardano Analytics: CoinMarketCap One of the most exciting developments ahead is Cardano’s integration with Bitcoin. By late 2025, ADA plans to allow Bitcoin users to interact with Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem, opening up new liquidity and transaction possibilities. The network is also rolling out Midnight, a privacy-focused sidechain that could revolutionize on-chain security and transaction privacy. Some analysts believe these developments could fuel a major price surge. According to recent projections, the Cardano price prediction for late 2025 could see ADA breaking past the $1.50 mark if these updates gain traction. Analysts at CoinCodex suggest Cardano could see some rapid growth in the next 3 months too, landing on $0.86 by late May . While the crypto market remains unpredictable, Cardano’s strong fundamentals and engaged community make it one of the more resilient projects in the space. Panshibi Pushes Meme Coins In A New Direction Panshibi (SHIBI) has graced the meme coin space with an offering that is ahead of its time. The project is pushing meme coins in the right direction, showing that they can be much more when they include real utility for investors and a philanthropic mission at their center. Panshibi is designed to generate real rewards for its investors. With staking rewards reaching up to 1,200% APY, token holders can earn significant passive income simply by participating in the ecosystem. A dedicated 15% of the total token supply has been set aside to ensure staking rewards remain attractive and sustainable. Early adopters also gain access to the Bamboo Private VIP Club, which provides exclusive benefits to those who get in ahead of the crowd. The crypto space is still plagued by scams and security risks, but Panshibi has implemented some of the most advanced security measures in the meme coin market to mitigate these risks. The smart contract has been fully audited by Coinsult, ensuring that it is free from vulnerabilities. Additionally, liquidity is locked for 10 years and team tokens are secured for two years, preventing sudden sell-offs and manipulation. These security measures give investors confidence that Panshibi is built for long-term stability. Many meme coins lose momentum after launch, but Panshibi has structured a roadmap that extends far beyond its presale phase to ensure its long term growth. The team has outlined plans for listings on major decentralized and centralized exchanges, NFT collaborations and the development of a social-fi ecosystem that will keep the community engaged. With ongoing innovations in place, Panshibi is ensuring that it remains relevant and valuable long after its launch. Unlike most meme coins that exist solely in the digital space, Panshibi is actively contributing to a meaningful cause. A portion of the project’s ecosystem funds panda conservation initiatives, providing resources for habitat preservation, wildlife research and breeding programs to help protect the species. As crypto projects look for ways to integrate with real-world impact, Panshibi is showing that blockchain technology can support environmental causes while delivering financial value to investors. Investors Race To Grab Their Share Of SHIBI Tokens Investors continue to race to the Panshibi presale to grab their share of SHIBI tokens before the price skyrockets. The presale has already raised almost $1.18 million, with tokens on offer for an alluring price of just $0.005 in the current stage. As the project continues to gain momentum, Panshibi is proving that it is more than just another meme coin – it’s a project with staying power. Analysts are taking note, projecting an explosive 1,200% price rise during the presale phase with more growth expected post-launch. For any savvy investor who wants to be a part of the future of meme coins, this project is not one to overlook in 2025.

Here Are the Most Critical Price Levels to Watch!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/5-7-billion-in-options-to-expire-in-bitcoin-and-ethereum-here-are-the-most-critical-price-levels-to-watch/,"While the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins were going through difficult days, there were sharp declines. As BTC fell below $80,000, a level not seen since November, today, as every Friday, the expiration date for options contracts in the crypto market has come. These options are even more important because they fall on the last Friday of both the week and the month. According to the news of Singapore-based crypto options data platform Greeks.live, 59,000 Bitcoin and 529,000 Ethereum options will expire on February 28 on the Deribit derivatives exchange. Accordingly, the Put/Call Ratio of BTC options is 0.7, the maximum loss point is $96,000 and the notional value is $4.66 billion. When we look at Ethereum, ETH options have a Put/Call Ratio of 0.52, a maximum loss point of $3,000, and a notional value of $1.12 billion. Impact on Bitcoin and Ethereum Prices! Greeks.live analysts said that a downtrend is dominant in the market and that investors see $82,000 as a critical support level that must be protected for the long-term rise to continue. The “maximum loss” price is the level where option buyers suffer the greatest loss and market makers see the greatest profit. At this point, the closer the Bitcoin price is to $96,000 and the Ethereum price to $3,000, the greater the loss option investors will experience, so major players and market makers in the market usually try to push the price to these levels. Also, historically, as options approach expiration, prices tend to drift toward the maximum pain level, making $96,000 for BTC and $3,000 for ETH a critical level to watch. What Does the Put/Call Ratio Signal for Bitcoin and Ethereum? The put/call ratio is calculated by dividing the number of put options by the number of call options. A ratio below 1 means there are more buys than puts, indicating an uptrend. A ratio above 1 means there are more puts than calls, indicating a downtrend. A ratio close to 1 means the market is balanced or neutral. For Bitcoin, this ratio is 0.7, indicating that the upward trend is still ongoing. For Ethereum, it is 0.52, indicating an upward trend. Accordingly, these rates indicate an upward trend for BTC and ETH. However, time will tell how these rates will affect the price. At this point, do not make your investment decisions based on a single data or report. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: $5.7 Billion in Options to Expire in Bitcoin and Ethereum!

Hold Tight to Your ETH, Sell Your PEPE, and Enter This Viral Presale for 10x Gains appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As the crypto market is facing increasing volatility, investors are looking for ways to secure promising gains. Therefore, analysts have pointed out the best strategies that could drive 100% gains, including holding on to the ETH token despite the current Ethereum price drop and selling the PEPE token. At the same time, crypto experts are pointing toward the viral presale of DTX Exchange which is making waves in the crypto industry with its 10x gains potential. This emerging platform has already secured more than $15.2 million in its presale and guarantees a 2x return on investment right after listing. DTX Exchange: A Viral Presale with 100% Gains and with 10x Potential The DTX Exchange presale success is going viral in the crypto market because of its massive growth potential. The DTX token is selling at $0.18 in the ongoing bonus presale, which will surge to $0.36 after the launch, guaranteeing investors the chance to double their profits. In addition, considering the widespread adoption of DTX Exchange, experts are also anticipating that it could rise to 10x, which means its price could surge up to $1.8. While holding the ETH token will eventually result in a 100% increase, DTX’s projected trajectory could put investors on the path to far greater gains. All these optimistic speculations around DTX Exchange are driven by the innovative hybrid functionality of its infrastructure, which could set new standards for crypto trading. The platform also offers an unmatched transaction speed of 200,000 TPS by leveraging VulcanX Blockchain technology, so traders can perform trades at high speed with low latency. Similarly, the platform will offer Phoenix Wallet which is designed with an exclusive quantum-proof focus. It could protect users’ assets from potential security breaches. Likewise, DTX Exchange supports a wide selection of different asset classes and ensures unified hassle-free management for these assets. In addition, DTX could allow traders to access advanced trading features such as charting software and analytical tools that could enhance trading efficiency. With these diverse offerings and groundbreaking presale success, DTX Exchange could deliver a promising prospect for investors looking to maximize their gains. Ethereum Price Drop: A Strategic Opportunity for 100% Gains? The recent security breach of Bybit exchange has caused a storm in the crypto market and resulted in a significant decline in the Ethereum price. This drop took the Ethereum price even below the low of the February 3 market crash to around $2,286. Source: CoinMarketCap This sharp decline of below $2,500 has increased the selling pressure around the Ethereum price. However, analysts are predicting that this downward trend of the Ethereum price is going to be followed by a capitulation phase in which the selling pressure will increase further. Along with this, a period of accumulation might happen, which could drive the next bull cycle for the Ethereum price. Hence, industry insiders suggest holding the ETH tokens tightly as it could potentially offer 100% gains in the long-term. Likewise, crypto experts are also recommending entering the viral presale of DTX Exchange as a prime opportunity to secure massive 10x gains. PEPE Crashes Hard: Selling Now Could Be the Smartest Move As of February 27, Pepecoin (PEPE) is trading at around $0.0000084, indicating a massive drop from its January high at around $0.000022. Source: CoinMarketCap Analysts believe the price of the PEPE token has been trading inside a falling wedge pattern without any signs of a potential breakout. From a monthly outlook, the PEPE token has dropped more than 34%. Further, the increased selling pressure has trapped the coin in a prolonged downward momentum. Industry insiders warn if the PEPE token continues this trajectory it might crash further to $0.0000065. Therefore, experts are urging investors to sell their PEPE holdings and shift their focus to DTX Exchange that could drive 10x gains. Final Thoughts While the Ethereum price drop could serve as an opportunity to secure 100% gains and selling PEPE could cut losses, DTX Exchange could offer much bigger gains with a potential 10x surge. With DTX nearing its launch, traders have limited time to lock in their guaranteed 2x returns by grabbing the token at a price of $0.18. Hence, experts advise investors not to miss out on this massive reward opportunity.

In January, registered losses stood at $73,915,700. Just a month later, this figure jumped to $1,528,342,400. The latter was the result of nine hacks. Additionally, the February number is an 18x increase from the same time a year prior. In February 2024, registered losses were $81,603,400, Immunefi researchers found. Notably, the majority of this sum was the result of a single hack. Crypto exchange Bybit lost $1.46 billion in the biggest hack in crypto’s history. This is followed by stablecoin bank Infini’s loss of $49.5 million . The top five losses also include zkLend ($9.5 million), Ionic Money ($8.6 million), and Cardex ($400,000). Source: Immunefi Meanwhile, observing the total losses year-to-date, the ecosystem lost $1,602,258,100 in 2025 so far. Immunefi found that this represents an 8x increase compared to $200 million during the same period last year. Additionally, it already surpassed the total losses for 2024 at $1.49 billion.

Actually, hacks account for 100% of the total losses – all of the $1.5 billion across the nine incidents. In the same time period, centralized finance (CeFi) again surpassed decentralized finance (DeFi) per the total amount lost, while DeFi still leads in the number of attacks. CeFi accounted for $1.46 billion or 95.5% of the total losses with a single incident (Bybit), while DeFi accounted for $68,342,400 or 4.5% across eight cases. Source: Immunefi At the same time, BNB Chain was the most targeted chain in February. More specifically, BNB Chain and Ethereum suffered four individual attacks each, which represents 72.8% of the total losses across targeted chains. Abstract , Mode , and Optimism suffered one attack each. Meanwhile, Immunefi says it has paid out over $112 million in total bounties so far, while saving over $25 billion in user funds. Several days ago, it launched Magnus , its AI-powered security orchestration platform that unites threat intelligence and automates security operations across a protocol’s security stack. In other words, the novel platform unifies security into a single platform that enables protocols to access, automate, and coordinate best-in-class security tools, Immunefi said.

Digital assets are going mainstream. How else would you describe an asset class being issued, developed, and openly supported by projects associated with a septuagenarian US president? Despite this, the price of Ethereum ( ETH ) is underperforming versus expectations. This is a sentiment that is reflected throughout social media. You might also like: The Ethereum paradox: Too big to fail or too slow to matter? | Opinion There are many theories as to why this is, ranging from shorts by hedge funds to a lack of a north star or the rise of competing blockchains like Solana. There is an element of truth in all of the above. However, I will focus on what is more interesting: the future of Ethereum and why I remain very positive. The newer alternatives A good starting point is to look at newer, faster platforms, and Solana ( SOL ) is often mentioned; however, its genesis block was back in 2020, and 5 years is a long time in this industry. There are even newer, faster blockchains—including Sui, Aptos, Monad, and Fogo—with more to come. Technology is an enabler, but it alone does not dictate success (remember Betamax?). From a software point of view, success is even less certain as new ideas can be integrated into existing products. Focusing on Ethereum, when it was launched, it was a proof-of-work blockchain similar to Bitcoin ( BTC ) but has since undergone a number of major upgrades (with zero downtime), including its move to proof-of-stake. These upgrades will continue over the next five years, improving areas including performance, usability, and developer experience. Pectra, the next upgrade , will provide greater transaction capacity and improve Ethereum staking functionality. Many of these changes are new and reflect changes from the previous roadmaps. The Ethereum ecosystem is fortunate to have a large number of expert researchers in fields such as distributed systems and cryptography. Whilst sometimes accused of operating in “Ivory Towers,” what they have consistently shown is deep thought in the direction that Ethereum should take and this often leads to changes in direction. Move fast and break things may work in some environments, but probably not with a multibillion dollar compute platform. A key example here was the move from a scaling technology known as sharding to what we have now with the layer-2-centric roadmap. The key differences L2’s will turn out to be a key differentiator for Ethereum, even if the path to get there feels long. They enable disparate teams to build their own scaling solutions using different technologies, all tied back to the core Ethereum protocol. If you believe Solana has made all of the right design decisions, Eclipse is an L2 that plugs Solana technology into Ethereum. Similarly if you want Meta’s Move programming language, you can build on an L2 such as Movement. L2s open up new programming languages and can optimize for different characteristics, whether that be speed, privacy, decentralization, alignment with a corporation ( such as Sony ), or something else entirely. This means that developers and users of Ethereum can decide what is important and use the corresponding L2 whilst still benefiting from the liquidity, security, and existing applications built on Ethereum. Whilst we already have a huge number of L2s, development is still ongoing to improve interoperability between them with the goal of enabling the frictionless transfer of assets and composability of applications. To this end, there are a number of technical standards (both Ethereum Improvement Proposals and Rollup Improvement Proposals ) aimed at both short-term and longer improvements to the user experience. So, does the L2 roadmap make sense? The number (over 140 L2s) suggests that an awful lot of people (and engineering investment) think it does! In addition, whilst the “total value locked” metric has many flavors and many flaws, it indicates that L2s are achieving product market fit with $42bn of assets being held. This is getting close to the $166bn worth of tokens issued on Ethereum and significantly more than the tokens issued on other chains (excluding the protocol’s own tokens). Whilst L2s will offer many improvements, using Ethereum itself is getting faster with protocol-led improvements but then also infrastructure such as “transaction pre-confirmations,” providing users with sub-second confirmation of their transactions, comparable to the fastest alternative blockchains. Regarding value, the tokenization of real-world assets is a key use case for blockchains, and we are now seeing significant progress. Stablecoins representing USD are valued at $216bn, with 58% of those issued on Ethereum (the next biggest are Tron ( TRX ) with 28% and Solana with only 5%) and with a focus of the current US administration on stablecoin growth, those numbers are set to climb! With regards to more complex assets, BlackRock’s BUIDL fund tokenizes $500mm USD of Treasury Bills on Ethereum but is only one of over 150 tokenized assets with a combined value of over $3.8bn (excluding stablecoins!). This is also set to increase with issuers such as Ondo finance and Backed tokenizing more assets on Ethereum. No other chain or L2 comes close to this level of tokenized value. Opinion Slva stable Developers are the answer If an institution is looking to build a crypto project, its starting point will be the technical community. With over 10k developers working on Ethereum Virtual Machine based projects (3x more than the next closest ecosystem), it is likely developers will recommend Ethereum. As seen with a stream of projects from institutions ranging from Deutsche Bank through to President Trump’s World Liberty Finance. More important than developers is security and stability. One of the reasons that Ethereum has a lower transaction throughput and longer development cycle is the focus on decentralization, uptime, and resilience. The network is run on nodes using six different software stacks, meaning a bug in one will not halt the network. Similarly, the network is designed to survive regional catastrophes, with around 10,000 nodes running in countries all around the world on computers as simple as a mobile phone. These design goals are reflected in the 100% uptime of the network since genesis. This illustrates that there is space for different blockchains to focus on their respective strengths. Ethereum is the premier smart contract platform being adopted for use in decentralized finance and for institutions building new financial rails and tokenized products. Bitcoin is easily understood as a store of value, and Solana is currently leading the way for higher-performance, low-value transactions such as meme coin trading. If there is one benefit to the noise around the ETH price, it could be that it has galvanized a more outward-looking effort by the Ethereum ecosystem. There is a realization that focusing purely on building may not be enough. The Ethereum Foundation has reactivated their X.com accounts, leaders in the space are being more vocal, and organizations such as Etherealize are advocating for Ethereum in Washington and on Wall Street. The leader in any industry can never afford to stand still, and digging beyond the headlines, Ethereum is continuing to drive innovation.

Terra Classic (LUNC): A Blockchain For Stable Global Payments Terra Classic (LUNC) is a blockchain protocol designed to power price-stable global payment systems using fiat-pegged stablecoins. It combines the stability and widespread use of traditional currencies with the censorship-resistant features of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC). Launched in April 2019 after development began in January 2018, Terra Classic offers stablecoins pegged to currencies such as the U.S. dollar, South Korean won, Mongolian tugrik, and the IMF’s Special Drawing Rights. In May 2022, the original Terra chain was rebranded as Terra Classic, and its native token was renamed LUNA Classic (LUNC). A new chain, called Terra (LUNA), was launched without stablecoins. The addition of “Classic” may reference the Ethereum/Ethereum Classic split in 2017. Terra Classic aims to provide fast and affordable settlements, leveraging blockchain technology to enhance global payments. The attractiveness of LUNC in the current market cycle depends on various factors, including technological advancements and market conditions. Stellar (XLM): Bridging Financial Systems with Blockchain Technology Stellar (XLM) is a decentralized, open-source payments network that uses blockchain technology to enable quick and low-cost fund transfers. It does not favor any national currency and features its own cryptocurrency, Stellar Lumens (XLM). Since its inception in 2014, Stellar has processed billions of transactions and formed partnerships with major companies. It facilitates transfers of any currency type, including digital representations of national currencies and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Unlike many cryptocurrencies that aim to overhaul financial systems, Stellar seeks to enhance them by offering a unified network for collaboration among diverse financial systems. The potential of Stellar lies in its ability to connect financial institutions, payment systems, and individuals around the world. By enabling global fund transfers and currency conversions swiftly and affordably, it addresses key challenges in cross-border payments. Companies can build blockchain applications on Stellar or use the network for payments. The Stellar Development Foundation promotes network use and maintains its infrastructure. In the current market cycle, Stellar’s focus on enhancing existing financial systems rather than replacing them may appeal to those looking for practical blockchain solutions. Its established partnerships and ongoing development suggest that it continues to be a relevant player in the cryptocurrency space. Kaspa: A High-Throughput PoW Cryptocurrency with GHOSTDAG Protocol Kaspa is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency that implements the GHOSTDAG protocol. Unlike traditional blockchains, which orphan parallel blocks, GHOSTDAG allows them to coexist and orders them in consensus. This means the Kaspa blockchain operates as a block Directed Acyclic Graph (blockDAG), a generalization of Nakamoto consensus. This structure enables secure operations while maintaining very high block rates, currently at one block per second, with goals to increase to 10 blocks per second and eventually 100 blocks per second. The fast block rates lead to confirmation times that are limited primarily by internet latency. The Kaspa implementation includes features such as Reachability to query the DAG’s topology, block data pruning, and Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) proofs. Plans for block header pruning and subnetwork support aim to facilitate the future implementation of layer 2 solutions, enhancing scalability and efficiency. In the current market cycle, Kaspa’s approach to consensus and high throughput may attract attention from those interested in blockchain innovations. TRON (TRX): Decentralizing Digital Content Creation TRON (TRX) is a blockchain-based operating system developed by the Tron Foundation and launched in 2017. Initially, TRX tokens were ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum network, but they moved to their own network in 2018. The platform aims to give full ownership rights to digital content creators by enabling direct interaction between content producers and consumers. This removes intermediaries like YouTube or Apple, allowing creators to receive a larger share of the rewards for their work. The TRON network supports smart contracts, various blockchain systems, and decentralized applications (dApps). It uses a transaction model similar to Bitcoin’s UTXO, with transactions recorded on a public ledger. TRON was built to create a decentralized Internet and serves as a tool for developers to create dApps, acting as an alternative to Ethereum. The ability to create and share content without transaction fees is a notable feature. In the current market cycle, TRON’s focus on content creators and dApp development may appeal to users and developers looking for such platforms.",Sponsored,EN,0,0,LUNC|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|BTC|ETC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-28 12:06:37

Developed to address Bitcoin’s scalability challenges, the network allows off-chain payments, making Bitcoin more practical for everyday use. At Bitfinex, we were pioneers whose early adoption spurred its growth, showcasing its real world potential for diverse applications such as micropayments, social media tipping, and cross-border remittances. El Salvador’s Bitcoin adoption, powered by the Lightning-enabled Chivo Wallet and circular economies like Bitcoin Beach, highlights its real-world impact. As Lightning continues to evolve with advancements in scalability, privacy, and ease of use, it is poised to solidify Bitcoin’s role as a global financial system. 10 Years of Lightning: A Brief Overview of Bitcoin’s Premiere Layer 2 The Bitcoin Lightning Network is a second-layer protocol built on top of Bitcoin’s layer 1 to facilitate faster and more cost-effective transactions. It was designed to address Bitcoin’s scalability challenges, as the base layer struggles to handle a large number of transactions simultaneously, leading to delays and high fees during periods of heavy network congestion. By creating a secondary layer where off-chain transactions can be conducted, the Lightning Network offers a way to use Bitcoin for everyday transactions without compromising its decentralization or security. The Lightning Network was developed to overcome the limitations of Bitcoin’s original design, which can process only about 7 transactions per second. This limited throughput made it impractical for Bitcoin to serve as a medium for small, frequent payments, such as buying coffee or paying for digital services. The network was introduced to enable faster, cheaper transactions by reducing the burden on the main blockchain, thereby enhancing Bitcoin’s usability as a day-to-day currency without compromising its role as a secure store of value. The Lightning Network is Bitcoin’s only true Layer 2 solution that enables decentralized, fast, non-custodial, and low-cost payments with unilateral exit options, ensuring users retain full control of their funds without relying on third-party custody, a critical feature for maintaining Bitcoin’s trustless and censorship-resistance characteristics. The Lightning Network operates through the creation of payment channels between users. These channels allow participants to transact with one another off-chain, with only the opening and closing of the channel being recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain. Payment channels in the Lightning Network operate by locking a specific amount of Bitcoin in a multi-signature address , allowing two parties to conduct off-chain transactions by updating their shared balance state, with only the final state being recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain when the channel is closed. Within a channel, an unlimited number of transactions can occur almost instantaneously and at minimal cost. When the channel is closed, the net result of all transactions are batch written to the blockchain. This mechanism significantly reduces congestion and fees on the main Bitcoin network while maintaining a similar level of security, censorship-resistance, and autonomy. While the Lightning Network enhances Bitcoin’s scalability, reduces transaction fees, and improves the speed of payments, it does have limitations. Setting up and managing channels requires technical knowledge, and the network can struggle with large or complex payments due to liquidity constraints in certain channels. Additionally, the requirement for both parties to be online for transactions to occur introduces potential usability challenges. Despite these limitations, the Lightning Network is particularly well-suited for microtransactions, cross-border payments, and applications such as tipping content creators, streaming payments, or enabling instant retail transactions. It represents a critical step in making Bitcoin more versatile and accessible for real-world use cases in digital commerce. A Look at the History of Bitcoin’s 1st Layer 2 Global Payments Network The Lightning Network was first proposed in 2015 by Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja in a white paper that outlined a vision for scaling Bitcoin through a second-layer solution. The aim was to address Bitcoin’s scalability problem, which limited the number of transactions the blockchain could handle per second. By creating an off-chain network of payment channels, Lightning promised faster, cheaper transactions while preserving the security and decentralization of the Bitcoin blockchain. Early prototypes and implementations, such as those by Lightning Labs , Acinq , and Blockstream , laid the groundwork for a new era of Bitcoin usability, focusing on small and frequent transactions. In December 2019, Bitfinex became the first major Bitcoin exchange to integrate the Lightning Network, playing a pivotal role in its early adoption. We enabled users to deposit and withdraw Bitcoin through Lightning, significantly reducing transaction fees and processing times compared to on-chain transactions. This move not only provided a real world demonstration of the practical utility of the Lightning Network but also encouraged other exchanges and wallet providers to follow suit. Our early adoption helped build confidence in Lightning, showcasing its potential for scaling Bitcoin and fostering an ecosystem of users and developers. Since its launch, the Lightning Network has seen remarkable growth in both adoption and technological advancement. By 2025, the network’s capacity has expanded significantly, with more and more nodes and channels created daily. The Lightning Network powers innovative micropayment use cases, such as Nostr’s “zaps” for social media tipping, Podcasting 2.0 and Wavlake’s “boosts” and streaming payments, enabling listeners to directly support podcasters and musicians with seamless, instant, and low-cost transactions. Companies like Strike and Cash App have integrated Lightning to facilitate instant and low-cost Bitcoin payments globally, while developers continue to improve the protocol’s functionality, security, and user experience. Innovations like Atomic Multipath Payments (AMPs) and enhancements in channel liquidity management have addressed some of the network’s early limitations, making it more robust and reliable for a broader range of applications. Looking ahead, Bitcoiners can expect the Lightning Network to play a central role in Bitcoin’s evolution as a global payment system. With growing institutional interest and increasing integration into traditional financial systems, Lightning is poised to further enhance Bitcoin’s utility for micropayments, remittances, and even decentralized applications. Developers are working on solutions to improve routing, privacy, and scalability, which will make Lightning more accessible and efficient. As adoption accelerates, the network is set to bridge the gap between Bitcoin as a store of value and its potential as a widely used medium of exchange, solidifying its role in the broader financial ecosystem. The Driver Behind El Salvador’s Bitcoin Adoption-Based Economy The Lightning Network played a pivotal role in El Salvador’s groundbreaking Bitcoin adoption, serving as the backbone for fast and low-cost transactions that make Bitcoin practical for everyday use. When El Salvador declared Bitcoin legal tender in 2021, the government launched the Chivo Wallet , a state-backed Bitcoin wallet designed to leverage the Lightning Network for instant, near-zero-cost payments. Chivo ATMs were installed nationwide, allowing users to deposit or withdraw funds seamlessly, with the Lightning Network ensuring that transactions could scale efficiently to meet the demands of a population new to cryptocurrency. A prime example of Lightning’s impact can be seen in El Zonte, also known as Bitcoin Beach , where a Bitcoin circular economy has flourished. Bitcoin Beach lit the initial fuse which inspired El Salvador President Nayib Bukele’s nationwide Bitcoin policy. This coastal community pioneered the use of Bitcoin for everyday transactions, with merchants and residents relying on the Lightning Network to pay for goods and services, from groceries to surf lessons. The success of Bitcoin Beach has become a model for similar initiatives across the country, demonstrating the practicality of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange in regions with limited access to traditional financial services. In the small mountain community of Berlin , another hub of Bitcoin adoption in El Salvador, the Lightning Network has enabled a similar transformation. Local businesses and residents use Lightning to trade goods and services, fostering financial inclusion and reducing reliance on cash. These grassroots initiatives highlight Lightning’s ability to facilitate real-world use cases, driving Bitcoin adoption at the local level. As El Salvador continues its Bitcoin experiment in 2025 and beyond, the Lightning Network will likely remain central to expanding merchant adoption, supporting circular economies, and proving Bitcoin’s utility as a transformative financial tool. The upcoming Torogoz Dev Graduation Ceremony marks a significant milestone for the non-profit organization, which focuses on training Salvadoran students in Lightning Network development and connecting them with job opportunities in the growing Bitcoin and crypto ecosystem in El Salvador. As part of their graduation project, the students developed “ Torogoz Pay ,” a Lightning-integrated payment gateway designed to split payments across the production chain. For instance, when a customer purchases a product, such as a $5 bag of coffee, the payment is distributed in real-time to the individuals involved in its production, including the farmers, roasters and packagers, with instant payment splits sent directly to their Lightning wallets. This innovative system not only facilitates transparency and fairness in payments but also has the potential to serve both local and international markets. The graduating cohort, consisting of six individuals, including one woman, is now equipped with skills in Lightning node administration, system setup, and software development, contributing to El Salvador’s vision of becoming a global Bitcoin hub.

Bitcoin took another hit early Friday, falling below $80,000 and taking February's decline to over 20%. That spurred a bloodbath in the broader crypto market, with ether sliding below $2,100, a level it managed to hold since August. It's not just crypto. Increased volatility in cryptocurrencies mirrors trends in traditional markets. Compare the 10% jump in the Volmex BVIV, which tracks the 30-day implied volatility in bitcoin, with the equal increase in the MOVE index, which measures the implied volatility of U.S. Treasury notes. The VIX, Wall Street's so-called fear gauge, has risen by 14%. These movements, coupled with a sell-off in growth-sensitive commodity currencies like the Australian, New Zealand and Canadian dollars, are indicative of jitters in the macroeconomy, primarily driven by renewed concerns over potential Trump tariffs , prompting a rotation towards less volatile assets. ""U.S. domestic policies have become unstable, and the White House seems happy to take advantage of this instability,"" said Griffin Ardern, head of options trading and research at crypto financial platform BloFin. ""Given the challenges investors face in obtaining accurate forward-looking guidance, many are more inclined to hold low-volatility assets ... Traders need to liquidate positions to reduce their exposure to specific assets before transitioning to other markets, which explains the decline across almost all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies."" Volatility looks set to remain heightened, with President Donald Trump reportedly scheduled to speak later on Friday . In the meantime, those hoping for a significant rebound in risk assets based on personal consumption data may be disappointed because anticipated soft readings could be overshadowed by tariff concerns and rising forward-looking inflation metrics. While the outlook may seem gloomy, more positive developments could occur once the macro dust settles. Notably, this week there was progress on the regulatory front, with the SEC dropping charges against Uniswap , one of the leading decentralized exchanges, and mulling the same regarding its issues with Consensys . As Evgeny Gaevoy, CEO of leading market maker Wintermute, pointed out at Consensus Hong Kong last week, many are overlooking the evolving attitude of the SEC, and this is a factor the market has yet to fully price in. Plus, the decline in the basis in the CME bitcoin and ether futures, a sign of weakening demand, has stalled and from a technical analysis perspective, bitcoin is fast closing toward a potential demand zone.

The partnership focuses on offering crypto trading services exclusively to institutional clients, marking a significant step in DekaBank’s involvement in digital assets. This collaboration is facilitated by Boerse Stuttgart Digital, which will ensure secure access to crypto trading using its fully regulated brokerage solution. The partnership follows Boerse Stuttgart Digital Custody receiving a full license under the European Union’s new Markets in Crypto-Assets ( MiCA ) framework, which came into effect in January 2024. DekaBank, founded in 1918, has over 411.5 billion euros in assets under management and is a key player in the German asset management space. While initially skeptical about cryptocurrencies, DekaBank started its journey into the crypto world in 2023 by collaborating with the Swiss digital asset firm Metaco to create a blockchain-based tokenization platform. This move was part of DekaBank’s efforts to explore the potential of crypto assets, despite the regulatory uncertainties in different regions. DekaBank’s entry into crypto trading aligns with the European Union’s MiCA regulations, which are providing clearer guidelines for the crypto market. The move comes after Boerse Stuttgart Digital saw its crypto business generate 25% of total revenues in 2024. Boerse Stuttgart Group’s CEO, Matthias Voelkel, expressed his satisfaction with the European Union’s regulatory approach, highlighting the importance of clear, smart regulations to foster innovation in the crypto market. Voelkel also pointed to the strong market dynamics coming from the US, which have helped boost confidence in the future of digital currencies. Despite challenges in the regulatory landscape, he emphasized the need for innovation within the crypto space, especially as global dynamics evolve. Europe’s progress with MiCA and Boerse Stuttgart’s regulatory-compliant infrastructure is setting the stage for greater institutional involvement in crypto trading, especially for those operating in heavily regulated environments. DekaBank’s new venture into crypto services, facilitated by Boerse Stuttgart Digital, exemplifies how established financial institutions are adapting to the changing crypto landscape. While the US may currently lead in certain technological innovations, Europe’s regulatory framework provides a stable foundation for cryptocurrency businesses, creating an environment conducive to growth and innovation. For DekaBank, this step into crypto trading signals a commitment to integrating digital assets into its traditional asset management services. With MiCA providing clarity, institutions like DekaBank can now confidently offer crypto services, providing them with a competitive advantage. As crypto regulation evolves, Boerse Stuttgart Digital is positioned as a key player in helping financial institutions navigate this new era. The platform’s regulated infrastructure enables secure and reliable access to crypto markets, helping firms like DekaBank enter the space without compromising on compliance or security. This partnership is a reflection of Europe’s strong commitment to creating a well-regulated crypto environment, one that can rival the US in crypto adoption. By embracing MiCA regulations , Europe is paving the way for future growth in the crypto sector. As more traditional financial institutions follow DekaBank’s lead, the industry is likely to see a broader acceptance of cryptocurrencies in mainstream finance. Boerse Stuttgart’s role in this transition highlights the importance of collaboration between traditional financial services and the growing crypto market, ensuring that both sectors can thrive within a regulated framework. Ultimately, this collaboration shows that despite the challenges the crypto industry faces globally, institutions are finding innovative ways to work within regulatory guidelines to push forward in the market. The MiCA framework offers the clarity and transparency needed to boost confidence in crypto investments, particularly for institutional players. As the space continues to evolve, partnerships like the one between DekaBank and Boerse Stuttgart Digital will play a key role in shaping the future of crypto in Europe.",,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-28 12:16:36

China Asset Management (Hong Kong), a subsidiary of one of China ‘s largest fund houses, has launched Hong Kong ‘s first retail tokenized money market fund in a collaboration with Hong Kong-based crypto exchange OSL. The so-called ChinaAMC HKD Digital Money Market Fund, approved by the Securities and Futures Commission, offers retail investors blockchain-based access to money market assets, the South China Morning Post reports . Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) serves as the tokenization agent, digital platform operator, and administrator, while Standard Chartered Trust (Hong Kong) acts as the custodian.

While it might sound like a fantasy, certain emerging altcoins are poised for explosive growth that could make this a reality. This article explores five cryptocurrencies with the potential to transform a small stake today into a life-changing fortune in the near future. $XYZ Targets 99,900% Growth, Unlocking G.O.A.T. Status XYZVerse ($XYZ) has brought a brand-new concept to the memecoin niche by blending the excitement of sports with the fast-moving energy of crypto. Designed for hardcore fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, this project goes beyond just being another token—it’s a growing community built around passion for the game. With the bold Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.) vision, XYZVerse is aiming higher than the average meme coin. And people are taking notice—it has recently earned the title of Best New Meme Project. What sets $XYZ apart? It’s not a short-lived trend. This project has a clear roadmap and a dedicated community focused on long-term growth. Fueled by the sports mentality , the $XYZ token has emerged as the ultimate contender ready to crush competitors. $XYZ is on its way to the winner’s podium to become a badge of honor for those who live and breathe sports and crypto. $XYZ Already Delivers Even Before Hitting the Market The $XYZ presale is underway, providing access to the token at a special pre-listing price.

If you’re not in, you’re out. The $XYZ presale is already smashing through stages with the speed of a champion’s knockout blow. Join $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions! Polkadot: Connecting Blockchains for a Faster, Smarter Future Imagine if blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin could talk without middlemen. That’s what Polkadot does. It’s a decentralized network that lets value and data move between blockchains. Using parachains, it boosts speed and scalability. It processes more transactions than Bitcoin or Ethereum. The DOT token is Polkadot’s cryptocurrency. It lets holders help run the network and rewards them for verifying transactions. Created by Gavin Wood, a co-founder of Ethereum, Polkadot launched in May 2020 aiming for a more connected blockchain future. Polkadot’s technology could change how blockchains work together. By letting networks communicate, it opens new doors for decentralized apps. In today’s market, where speed and connectivity matter, Polkadot shines. Compared to other coins, DOT solves problems that older blockchains face. As demand for efficient networks grows, Polkadot may be an attractive option. Though the crypto market is shifting, Polkadot’s strong tech gives it a solid standing now. POL: Unlocking Opportunities in the Growing Polygon Network The Polygon Ecosystem Token, or POL, is key to the expanding Polygon network. This token serves many roles within the ecosystem. Holders can stake their tokens, locking them up to support the network. In return, they earn rewards. Staking keeps the network secure. POL also lets holders vote on important decisions, giving the community a voice in the network’s future. POL opens doors to exclusive services within the Polygon ecosystem. As the network grows, the token becomes more useful. More applications and services joining the network could increase demand for POL, possibly boosting its value. In the current market, many are watching tokens like POL as the crypto space changes. While it’s important to consider all factors, POL’s role in the Polygon network makes it a token worth noting. AVAX: The Fast and Eco-Friendly Blockchain Powering the Future of Transactions Avalanche (AVAX) is a blockchain platform known for its speed and low cost. It can process up to 4,500 transactions per second, with transactions finalizing in less than two seconds. This makes it much faster than many other blockchains. Avalanche is also eco-friendly, which is important in today’s world. Users can create their own customizable Subnets, allowing for flexibility and specific needs. The platform uses a unique consensus mechanism that combines classical and Nakamoto methods for security and efficiency. It has three types of chains for different purposes, like handling transactions and running smart contracts. The AVAX token is central to the system, used for paying fees, staking to secure the network, and operating Subnets. In the current market, AVAX stands out for its strong technology and potential. Its speed and low fees make it attractive compared to other coins that can be slower or more costly. The ability to launch Subnets and create custom tokens adds value for developers and businesses. As the demand for scalable and efficient blockchain solutions grows, platforms like Avalanche could see increased use. While the crypto market can be unpredictable, AVAX’s innovative features make it a coin worth watching. Chainlink: Unlocking Real-World Potential in Blockchain Chainlink is making waves by helping smart contracts interact with the real world. It acts as a bridge, allowing these digital agreements to access data from outside their network. By using trusted sources called oracles, Chainlink ensures that the information fed into smart contracts is accurate. This means smart contracts can now respond to real events, like changes in weather or stock prices. It’s a big step forward, making blockchain technology more practical and useful. In today’s market, Chainlink stands out because it adds real value to how blockchains operate. Unlike other coins that might just offer a new way to transact, Chainlink enhances existing systems by providing reliable data connections. The LINK token is central to this process, rewarding those who supply accurate information and helping secure the network. With more applications needing dependable data feeds, especially in finance and insurance, Chainlink’s approach looks promising. Compared to other coins, LINK offers a unique solution that’s in demand, making it an attractive option in the current market cycle. Conclusion DOT, POL, AVAX, and LINK could yield significant returns, but XYZVerse (XYZ), the first all-sport memecoin, unites fans and aims for 20,000% growth.

Calling itself an unstoppable force that could push Bitcoin towards the $1M mark, the project aims to bring people to the top as BTC becomes the most valuable asset in the world. Beyond the narrative, however, what makes this project interesting is how it has integrated its core attributes within its core features. Earning Bitcoin Airdrops Those who hold BTCBULL tokens, the native crypto of BTC Bull, gain access to Bitcoin airdrops that will arrive when Bitcoin rises to new levels. The final airdrop will be held for the BTCBULL tokens, which will happen once Bitcoin rises to the $250K mark. Token Burn Milestones Furthering its agenda to grow besides Bitcoin, BTC Bull aims to burn a portion of its total supply through token burn events that will happen every time Bitcoin goes up by another $25K. The hope is for the buying pressure to pile on so that BTCBULL can experience a parabolic increase. Stake to Earn Much like other presales, BTC Bull has also opted for a presale staking mechanism, which will reward early buyers with passive earning. This approach could compound the gains they make from the listing pump, making BTCBULL a worthy investment. Tying the Milestones with Bitcoin's Growth As already mentioned, BTC Bull is pushing towards growth by tying the milestones to Bitcoin's rising value. Each time Bitcoin grows $25K, a Bitcoin airdrop and a token burn will be initialized at alternate times. The diagram below gives the complete layout of how the roadmap has been designed. This approach makes BTC Bull have an almost symbiotic relationship with Bitcoin. As BTC Bull's community grows, more buyers will come interested in Bitcoin, leading to Bitcoin's surge. In turn, that surge could lead to BTCBULL reaching its milestone and initiating burns to boost its value. This bi-directional growth could eventually lead to massive gains for BTCBULL and the Bitcoin community. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LFGsPR7TA Nass Crypto is a prolific YouTuber with upwards of 1 million subscribers, who has already talked positively about this project, highlighting its potential as a new meme coin. A Look at BTC Bull's Tokenomics BTC Bull's tokenomics is interesting, especially since the total supply has similarities with Bitcoin's. There are 21 billion tokens in total. 15% of it has been allocated to the Bull fund. 15% is for the milestone burn fund, 10% is for the BTC Airdrop, 10% is for staking distribution, 10% is for exchange liquidity and the final 40% is for PR and marketing. By ensuring that a maximum amount of tokens aren't allocated to the presale, BTC Bull has made sure that people are incentivized to buy the token once it goes live on cryptocurrency exchanges. Factors that Could Lead to BTC Bull's Growth Here are some factors that could lead the BTC Bull Token to grow in value. Bull run If and when the bull run arrives, BTC Bull could potentially move up in value thanks to token burns and airdrops. Social media While BTC Bull has a healthy number of followers right now, it could experience a higher level of growth if more members join up. The new style of heroic memes can definitely help its case. https://twitter.com/BTCBULL_TOKEN/status/1888895683555680551 New meme themes A bull is an animal rarely used as a mascot of a meme coin - at least none of the top ones have it. This gives BTC Bull an opportunity to become a pioneering crypto in this new niche. Presale Since the market is volatile, people are more inclined to investing in tokens that could bring them gains easily. As a presale asset, BTC Bull may go through a listing pump. Final Words BTC Bull's value proposition comes from its indirect relation to Bitcoin and its approach to focusing on Bitcoin growth and funneling it onto itself. Not breaking any new grounds, the project pays homage to the Bitcoin community. This respectful approach makes it a worthy meme coin for investors. Furthermore, it could give a suitable entry point to Bitcoin enthusiasts who have stayed away till now due to cost concerns. So, should one invest in BTC Bull? It depends on the preference, but in the current market conditions, meme coins like this one should be considered.

SEI, TIA, and XYZ have shown remarkable resilience during challenging times. Could they be the ones to lead the next market upswing? This article delves into what sets them apart and why they might dominate the forthcoming bull run. XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. As the first-ever all-sports meme token, it’s attracting both sports fans and crypto enthusiasts, creating a unique crossover that’s gaining serious traction. With a strong presale and an engaged community, some investors are already eyeing major potential gains. More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.002 by Stage 10, with over 90% of the $7.5 million milestone already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a final presale target price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” Of course, in crypto, nothing is guaranteed, but the excitement is undeniable. Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility. By bringing together traditional sports fans and the fast-moving crypto space, XYZVerse is building something different—something with entertainment value and real engagement. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Sei (SEI) Shows Signs of Recovery Amid Market Fluctuations Sei (SEI) has been trading between $0.23 and $0.31 recently. Over the past week, the price has increased by 15.30%, indicating a possible shift in momentum. Both the 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are at $0.27, suggesting price stability over these periods. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 45.43, which is near the neutral zone, while the stochastic oscillator is at 16.69, possibly pointing towards an oversold condition. If Sei breaks above the nearest resistance level at $0.34, it could aim for the next resistance at $0.42. Achieving this would represent an increase of over 30% from its current price range. On the downside, the nearest support level is at $0.19, with a secondary support at $0.11. With many in the crypto community anticipating an upcoming altcoin season and a broader market uptrend, Sei might experience further growth. However, market conditions can change rapidly, so it’s important to stay informed and consider all factors when evaluating potential developments. Celestia (TIA) Gains Momentum with 19% Weekly Increase Celestia (TIA) has seen a strong rally in the past week, with a price increase of 19.63%. The current price ranges between $3.10 and $4.16, showing signs of renewed interest from buyers. The 10-day simple moving average is $3.81, slightly above the 100-day average of $3.61, indicating short-term bullish momentum. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 46.42, suggesting the market is neither overbought nor oversold. The low stochastic value of 11.68 points to a possible undervalued state, which could attract more buyers. If the bullish trend continues, Celestia could test the nearest resistance level at $4.61. A successful breakout above this level might pave the way toward the second resistance at $5.67, representing a potential upside of around 35% from the current upper price range. On the downside, the nearest support is at $2.49, which traders should watch in case of a pullback. With optimism around a global crypto bull run and altcoin season, Celestia has the potential to capitalize on market momentum and see significant growth in the near future. Conclusion In the current bull market, SEI and TIA show promise, but XYZ stands out by uniting sports fans in a memecoin aiming for massive growth and community engagement.

Pump.fun’s protocol fee revenue has declined by 92%, falling from its peak of $15.38 million on Jan. 25 to just $1.1 million today, according to DefiLama . This sharp decline in revenue comes as the broader activity on Pump.fun and the Solana ( SOL ) network has slowed in the wake of the recent events in the meme coin space, most notably the LIBRA fiasco involving Argentine President Javier Milei. Source: DefiLama Apart from the fee revenue, token launches on Pump.fun have also seen a massive decline, dropping from over 70K on Jan. 23 to approximately 25K by Feb. 26, according to Dune data . This decline is part of the broader trend observed this year, with meme coin marketcap shedding considerably in value . You might also like: Over $44 billion wiped out from the memecoin market in the past 3 weeks Meme coins were crashing it in 2024, reporting an annual gain of 212% for the sub-sector, according to Binance analysis . This surge was largely fueled by the popularity of Pump.fun, which saw over 5.7 million new projects launched and generated more than $400 million in revenue throughout the year. However, 2025 has brought a shift in sentiment. Initially, meme coins were viewed as “fair launch” opportunities, where retail investors had the same chance to profit as venture capitalists and funds. However, this perception has now been challenged. The launch of the Milei coin , for example, saw its valuation hit $1 billion and quickly rise to $4 billion, revealing the scammy, manipulative nature of the meme coin sector. Pump.fun itself has recently fallen victim to fraud. On Feb. 26, the Pump.fun X account was compromised and used to promote a fake governance token PUMP along with other fraudulent coins.

Indeed, despite him being a ‘level three’ sex offender – deemed likely to repeat the offence – digital assets media welcomed the billionaire financier as something of a counterweight to JPMorgan’s (NYSE: JPM ) Jamie Dimon. At the time, Dimon was already known as an exceptionally harsh cryptocurrency critic , making Epstein’s credibility as a businessman important for the industry’s legitimacy after he commented on Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) strong potential. Furthermore, the controversial billionaire is considered one of the first to position BTC as a ‘store of value’ when he explained the coin does not suffer from a potentially critical flaw in treating gold as a safe haven for wealth: it is entirely impossible to find a previously-unknown cache of Bitcoin that could crash its value overnight. Epstein was also noted for believing BTC can’t be described as a currency, albeit with a caveat that he believed much of the vocabulary used for finance was outdated, even doubting the applicability of the word ‘currency.’ Did Epstein have direct links with cryptocurrency? Still, despite the assumption that the financier and sex offender gave much thought to Bitcoin, his potential direct involvement with digital assets remains a mystery as there is no evidence of ownership or investments. What is known – much as many other aspects of Epstein’s life – proved fertile ground for conspiracy . The financier has been a backer of MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative (DCI), a fact that allegedly led to the resignation of director Joichi Ito. In turn, the DCI was a backer of several core Bitcoin developers starting 2015, leading to the theory – particularly driven by Epstein’s documented and suspicious links with many high-profile individuals – that the BTC fork that led to the split with Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ) was an elaborate coup against the world’s premier cryptocurrency. Why Epstein conspiracy theories are on the rise Given the continued chaos related to the release of the Epstein files, the alleged participation of numerous celebrities – potentially even President Donald Trump – in the financier’s underage prostitution ring, and the many allegations the FBI is processing the documentation for selective release, the theories are likely to become even more pronounced. One recent example of the uncertainty and allegations related to Epstein – alleged to have committed suicide while in custody in 2019 – are the reports that he was not only a Mossad asset but also an FBI informant, per the X posts made by the prominent citizen journalist Mario Nawfal. 🚨🇺🇸BREAKING: EPSTEIN—FBI INFORMANT CONFIRMED Newly released Epstein Files reveal that Jeffrey Epstein wasn’t just connected to intelligence—he was an FBI informant.

Meanwhile, Hong Kong is doubling down on AI and Web3 investments, with its Cyberport initiative allocating over $125 million to AI research and infrastructure development. Dubai-based VC firm Disrupt.com is also making a major push into AI-driven Web3 startups, announcing a $100 million investment to accelerate commercialization in emerging tech sectors. Virtuals Protocol Sees Sharp Revenue Decline Virtuals Protocol, an AI-driven blockchain platform that enables the creation and monetization of AI agents, experienced a dramatic 96.8% decline in daily trading revenue, despite its recent expansion from Coinbase’s Ethereum layer-2 Base to the Solana network. Data from Dune Analytics indicates that the protocol peaked with daily revenue surpassing $1 million on Jan. 2 but has since fallen to less than $35,000 on Feb. 27. Virtuals daily trading revenue (Source: Dune ) The revenue generated from the platform’s Base network is particularly weak, and remained below $1,000 for ten consecutive days. This is a very steep decline from its peak of $859,000 on Oct. 27 of 2024. On Feb. 27, Virtuals Protocol recorded $28,492 in revenue on Base and only $6,300 on Solana. Additionally, the number of new AI agents created daily on the platform also remained in single digits for the past ten days. AI agents created (Source: Dune ) Virtuals was initially launched on Base, and gained traction for its innovative AI agents, which had the ability to manage their own cryptocurrency wallets and interact with users by tipping them on social media to encourage engagement. The protocol’s expansion to Solana on Jan. 25 was intended to capitalize on the network’s surging popularity. However, Solana faced a lot of scrutiny over the past few weeks due to a wave of failed presidential meme coins that shed light on the persistent scamming issues on the blockchain. This very likely contributed to Virtuals’ underwhelming performance since its transition. The platform currently has approximately 170,000 unique wallets holding Virtuals agents’ tokens on Base, compared to just 11,000 on Solana. Wallet activity also plummeted across both networks, with only 7,642 wallets involved in at least one token transaction on Feb. 27. The struggles of the Virtuals ecosystem are reflected in the declining value of its native token VIRTUALS as well, which dropped by more than 13% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. It is, however, important to keep in mind that this decline aligns with a broader downturn in the cryptocurrency market, driven by rising global trade tensions. VIRTUALS price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Despite the overall market correction, Virtuals Protocol seems to be losing ground among the top cryptocurrencies. When the project first announced its move to Solana, it held the 68th position by market capitalization. However, it has since fallen to the 92nd spot . Hong Kong Boosts AI and Web3 Investments Despite Viruals’ AI woes, Hong Kong’s Cyberport , which is a government-backed business hub specializing in Web3, blockchain, and artificial intelligence, is intensifying its investments in emerging technologies to establish the city as a global technology leader. On Feb. 27, Cyberport hosted the “AI Safety, Trust, and Responsibility” forum that brought together international AI academic institutions to discuss governance, safety, and responsible innovation. The hub currently hosts more than 270 blockchain-related enterprises and close to 350 startups dedicated to AI and big data research and development. A day earlier, on Feb. 26, the Hong Kong government’s 2025–26 budget placed a strong emphasis on technological advancement, and placed a lot of emphasis on seizing opportunities in artificial intelligence and Web3. Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po announced the allocation of 1 billion Hong Kong dollars ($125.5 million) to establish the Hong Kong AI Research and Development Institute. The institute will focus on facilitating upstream research, refining midstream and downstream innovations, and expanding real-world AI applications. As part of the city’s drive to become an AI and blockchain hub, Cyberport’s Artificial Intelligence Supercomputing Centre (AISC) will scale up to a computing power of 3,000 petaFLOPS, enabling it to process 3,000 quadrillion floating-point operations per second. This will greatly accelerate AI research and computational efficiency. The World Digital Technology Academy (WDTA), a co-organizer of the AI forum, also announced the establishment of the WDTA Asia-Pacific Institute (preparatory) at Cyberport. Executive Chairman Yale Li outlined the institute’s three core initiatives: developing a “safety-native” technological framework, establishing a “human-oriented” value system, and promoting “responsible innovation.” To foster a strong talent pipeline, Cyberport signed multiple Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) with universities and institutions to provide students with internship and employment opportunities. The Hong Kong government is also committed to supporting AI-driven innovation through some impressive financial backing. A total of 3 billion Hong Kong dollars ($385.6 million) was allocated for the launch of a three-year AI Subsidy Scheme under Cyberport. AI and Web3 Get $100M Boost from Disrupt.com Dubai-based venture capital firm Disrupt.com also recently announced plans to invest $100 million in artificial intelligence startups operating at the intersection of Web3 and other industries. The investments will help accelerate the commercialization of emerging AI technologies. According to the firm’s Feb. 27 announcement, the funds will support AI-driven solutions across cybersecurity, automotive technology, the retail sector, and blockchain applications. The move aligns with Disrupt.com’s history of fostering tech innovation, as its founders previously created cloud solutions provider Cloudways, which was acquired by Digital Ocean Holdings for $350 million in cash in 2022. The announcement was made at a time when venture capital funding in the Middle East and North Africa experienced a big downturn. According to Arab News , startups in the region secured $2.3 billion in funding last year, which was a 42% decline from 2023. This trend mirrors broader challenges in the emerging venture markets, including MENA, Africa, Pakistan, Turkiye, and Southeast Asia, as reported by data provider Magnitt. Despite the decline, the United Arab Emirates was the largest VC market in the MENA region, with local firms raising $1.1 billion across 207 deals in 2023. (Source: Magnitt ) While venture funding in emerging markets has been sluggish, AI is still a major draw for investors worldwide. The United States has seen a big surge in venture capital activity in the AI sector, with EY reporting a 57% increase in AI-related deals in the fourth quarter of 2023. The four largest AI venture deals during this period totaled $26.6 billion. With AI infrastructure still in its early stages, EY predicts that investment in AI startups will continue to accelerate, potentially capturing 45% of all VC funding in 2025.

40961235,https://invezz.com/?p=2594283,1740749743,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Here’s why big investors choose Mutuum Finance (MUTM) when Bitcoin (BTC) falls 20%,https://invezz.com/news/2025/02/28/heres-why-big-investors-choose-mutuum-finance-mutm-when-bitcoin-btc-falls-20-2/,"With prices falling below important support levels, the market has been rocked by Bitcoin’s recent 20% collapse. As institutional demand appears to be decreasing and traders prepare for more declines, uncertainty is increasing. Since Bitcoin is having trouble regaining traction, a lot of investors are searching for other options that provide stability and room for long-term growth. One initiative that is attracting notice is Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a DeFi lending platform that is growing rapidly. MUTM’s presale has been gathering traction and attracting interest from those wishing to obtain tokens early, despite the volatility of the wider market. Many people view the technical bear market that Bitcoin is currently experiencing as a strategic opportunity to move toward assets with solid fundamentals and expanding applications. BTC price falls 20% from all-time high As selling pressure keeps increasing, Bitcoin has fallen 20% from its peak and is now trading below $87,000. A wave of liquidations has contributed to the price drop; in a single day, the cryptocurrency market lost around $1.6 billion. Market sentiment has shifted to “extreme fear,” making it harder for BTC to find support. Analysts warn that if Bitcoin fails to hold key levels, a deeper correction could follow. Some traders are watching for a possible drop toward $73,800, while others believe this dip could be a buying opportunity. Institutional demand appears to be slowing, adding to the uncertainty about where BTC will go next. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) By providing a decentralized platform where users may lend cryptocurrency or supply assets and get passive income without having to sell their holdings, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is revolutionizing DeFi lending. The protocol reduces default risks for lenders by requiring overcollateralization, which guarantees a stable and secure lending environment. The platform pays suppliers according on pool utilization rates and offers competitive APYs. Each asset is given a carefully considered Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio, which permits borrowers to access liquidity while preserving system integrity. For instance, a borrower can borrow up to $7,500 in stablecoins without having to sell their $10,000 worth of Ethereum (ETH) if they have a 75% LTV. Because of this equilibrium, the lending market is sustainable and appealing to both active traders and long-term investors. Mutuum Finance also introduces mtTokens, which represent a user’s deposits and accumulate value over time. For example, the platform produces 10 mtETH when 10 ETH is deposited. Lenders gain more ETH when they withdraw since the value of mtETH increases when borrowers return their loans with interest. This system is a dependable source of revenue since it enables users to make money passively without engaging in active trading. A key driver of MUTM’s long-term potential is its buy-and-distribute mechanism. A portion of platform fees is used to buy back MUTM tokens, creating continuous buying pressure. These purchased tokens are then distributed to suppliers and stakers, ensuring ongoing demand for MUTM and reducing selling pressure. As more users participate, the buy pressure increases, strengthening the token’s value. The presale phase has drawn significant attention, with investors eager to secure MUTM at its lowest price of $0.015. With over $1.5 million raised and nearly 3,000 holders onboard, demand is growing rapidly. Experts predict a minimum 1,400% surge after launch, with the potential for even greater returns as adoption increases. For those looking to secure high returns, investing now is a strategic move. A $1,000 investment at the current presale price will grow to $15,000 or more, once Mutuum Finance (MUTM) launches and reaches its projected price levels. With its lending model, passive income opportunities, and well-structured tokenomics, Mutuum Finance is set to become a major player in DeFi. This is the best chance to secure MUTM at its lowest price before its value surges.

Buterin asserts that wallet providers must develop solutions to prevent and mitigate losses resulting from traders’ negligence and accidents. Notably, Vitalik Buterin’s reminder comes amid Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade updates and the recent security audit release. Ethereum conducted a major security review through multiple audits and a formal verification process. Wallet Solutions Must Address Non-Theft Crypto Losses, Says Vitalik Buterin In a recent X post , Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum blockchain, emphasized the significance of mitigating crypto losses caused by non-malicious activities. Such non-theft crypto losses arise from traders’ carelessness and unintentional errors. Buterin added, “Software bug, forgotten password, lost device, paper wallet burned down in LA fire, upgraded device without backing up data …. lots of ways for that to happen.” Further, Buterin posited that wallet solutions should address these kinds of accidental losses in addition to the often prioritized crypto thefts and hacks. Unlike theft-related losses, victims of accidental or self-inflicted crypto losses often suffer in silence. This is because “they see no one to blame but themselves, victims will be too ashamed to talk about it.” Moreover, Vitalik Buterin emphasized the importance of developing robust and resilient wallet security solutions. This move is to effectively mitigate the frequent and significant losses resulting from such issues. Ethereum Pectra’s Security Updates: An Overview On February 24, Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade was deployed on the Holesky testnet. However, it encountered finalization problems, with all nodes failing to reach consensus on block validation, delaying the pre-planned launching timeline. Recently, Vitalik Buterin’s Ethereum network released the audit focusing on the external security review of the Pectra System Contracts. Conducting rigorous security updates, the Ethereum blockchain is prioritizing the notion of customer safety. Through several audits and an official verification process, the blockchain team identified and addressed critical security issues. This comprehensive approach ensures the contracts’ security and functionality align with the intended specifications, providing a robust foundation for the Pectra upgrade. Previously, the Ethereum founder highlighted the key goals of Ethereum blockchain’s leadership changes. It is obvious that Buterin’s main objective is to strengthen the blockchain’s security measures. Vitalik Buterin Prioritizes Security Concepts Vitalik Buterin’s recent reminder on the crypto losses followed his recent plans to adopt the Poseidon hash function to improve the platform’s efficiency. He encouraged Ethereum blockchain researchers to contribute to the ongoing Poseidon cryptanalysis program. He stressed the need for rigorous examination and verification of its security properties. Reiterating his approach to blockchain security, Vitalik Buterin, in his recent post, alerted against the increasing non theft-related crypto losses. This showcases Buterin’s commitment to prioritizing user safety and addressing often-overlooked security concerns, beyond just focusing on theft-related threats.

Ethereum ( ETH ) dropped to a low of $2,075, its lowest level since January 2024 and about 50% below its highest level in November 2023. The ongoing decline has broken the second-largest cryptocurrency’s six-year track record. This marks the first February decline for Ethereum since 2018 and its worst February performance on record. Ethereum seasonality | Source: CoinGlass Ethereum’s decline has been more severe than that of its largest rivals. Bitcoin ( BTC ) has fallen by 25% from its highest level this year, while Ripple ( XRP ) is down around 40% in the same period. Ethereum has dropped partly due to ongoing outflows in the exchange-traded fund. All spot Ethereum ETFs have seen asset losses for six consecutive days, bringing cumulative assets in these funds to $2.86 billion. Similarly, spot Bitcoin ETFs have shed over $4 billion worth of assets.

The broader crypto market fear has also contributed to Ethereum’s downturn, with the Fear & Greed Index dropping to 33. Ethereum price loses key support as it forms a death cross ETH price chart | Source: crypto.news ETH price has continued crashing, as predicted in our earlier analysis, where we cited the bearish flag chart pattern. A flag pattern consists of a long vertical move followed by consolidation. This consolidation formed a rising wedge pattern, a well-known bearish continuation signal. Worse, Ethereum has just formed a death cross, which occurs when the 200-day moving average crosses below the 50-day moving average. This is considered one of the most bearish technical patterns in the market. Ethereum has also lost the key support level at $2,150, which previously marked the lowest swing in August and September 2023. This price served as the neckline of the triple-top pattern at $4,000. Additionally, the Average Directional Index has risen to 40, indicating that downward momentum is strengthening. Given that the distance between the triple-top pattern and the neckline at $2,150 is 47%, applying the same measure downward suggests that Ethereum’s price could crash to $1,095.

Let’s dive into the Rexas Finance price prediction for 2025 and beyond. Now let’s discuss Rexas Finance price prediction for 2025 and beyond. Rexas Finance price prediction 2025 While the general sentiment in the financial markets is that 2025 will be the year of the bull, it is important to understand that this prediction also has a chance of being wrong. BTC has already breached the $100k mark and there is a possibility that it may be at the top of this bull cycle. Also, the RXS token is yet to be launched in the crypto market and it is anyone’s guess as to how the price will react once it is listed on many crypto exchanges. Hence it is advised to do your research before investing in Rexas or any other cryptocurrency with the hopes of gaining on your investment in 2025. Rexas Finance price prediction 2030 As per Bitcoinist’s Rexas Finance coin price prediction for 2030, Rexas’s price could vary between $0.01 and $0.30. Bitcoin News expects that Rexas’s price could climb to $150 by the end of 2030. Before trusting any source that is trying to predict Rexas Finance price prediction for 2030, you should understand that it is a cryptocurrency and like all other tokens, the Rexas token’s price can be highly volatile. This means that no one knows if this token can survive the next five years as there have been many instances where crypto tokens have lost their entire value while some are clear cases of rug pull. You should also note that crypto tokens experience higher volatility than other financial markets and this can cause big price fluctuations in its price.

Cryptocurrencies in general experience rapid price swings that are directly driven by market sentiments, community engagement, events like token burns, and so on. While it is hard to determine how high the RXS token will go, it is important to look out for potential buying factors that may include new partnerships, increased token holders, or viral campaigns in general. It is also vital that you rely on financial experts and consult them for Rexas Finance crypto price prediction, but even after all that, you should remain cautious as no one can accurately predict how high or low Rexas can go.

Ripple ( XRP ) dropped below the $2 support level for the first time since Feb. 2 as the crypto market downturn continued. The ongoing decline is largely driven by macroeconomic factors in the United States, where Donald Trump has threatened hefty tariffs on Canadian, Mexican , and Chinese goods. These tariffs could lead to stagflation and force the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates prematurely. Indeed, the 10-year Treasury yield has fallen to 4.26%, while the 30-year yield has dropped to 4.53%. A few months ago, both hovered near 5%, as the Federal Reserve signaled its intention to keep rates higher for longer.

If approved, an XRP ETF could attract billions in inflows, driving higher demand for the token. XRP price crashes to the danger zone XRP price chart | Source: crypto.news Technical indicators suggest that Ripple may be headed for a strong bearish breakout in the coming days, now that it has entered a danger zone. The price crashed to a low of $1.9615, a key level since it served as the neckline of the head-and-shoulders pattern. The head-and-shoulders pattern consists of a head, two shoulders, and a neckline. A bearish breakout is confirmed when the price drops below the neckline. Additionally, XRP’s price has reached the 50% Fibonacci retracement level and has fallen below the 50-day moving average. The Average Directional Index has also surged to 36, indicating a strong trend, as ADX readings above 20 typically confirm momentum strength. Given these factors, Ripple’s price could decline further to the 61.8% retracement level at $1.6230, where it may experience a reversal. This retracement level, known as the golden ratio, is where most pullbacks typically occur. Failure to hold this support could result in further downside, potentially pushing XRP to $1.13, the 78.6% retracement level, approximately 45% below the current price.

The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) wants to discourage investors from hoarding the dollar to boost confidence in its currency as capital outflows rise. China moves to reduce dollar holdings amid yuan weakness Over the past year, Chinese investors have hoarded more dollars due to higher U.S. interest rates and consistent doubts over China’s slow economy, which seems to be worsening. As a result, the PBOC pushed for lower dollar deposit rates to stabilize the yuan and manage the rising capital outflows. Official data indicates that onshore foreign exchange deposits hit $892.4 billion in January 2024, the highest since April 2023. Among these stats, household dollar deposits rose $18% year-over-year to $146.1 billion, while corporate dollar holding reached $451.9 billion. These high-dollar deposits have lowered the conversion ratio (how willing businesses and individuals are to switch dollars back to yuan), resulting in the largest record of foreign exchange sales to clients since July 2023 and raising demand for the U.S. dollar. For example, the Bank of East Asia will reduce its rate on one-year dollar deposits in sums greater than $20,000 from 4.4% to 3.4%, and the Bank of Nanjing will lower its three-month dollar deposit rate on sums greater than $3,000 from 4.3% to 2.1%. Other state-owned banks will follow in the coming weeks. Chinese regulators have also warned about the growing tendency among investors to hoard dollars, arguing that risk-taking speculation could trigger outsized capital outflow and lead to even more depreciation of the yuan. Those lower deposit rates are meant to make dollar savings relatively less attractive and prod investors back into yuan-denominated assets. Yuan faces pressure from global economic factors The interest rate spread between China and the U.S. is wider now than ever, attracting more Chinese investors to the dollar. Thus, the Chinese yuan must compete with high-yielding U.S. Federal Reserve interest rates, giving dollar deposits about 4.5% returns, while yuan deposits yield less than 1%. Market analysts report that China’s capital controls have limited large-scale capital flight, and as the dollar rises, the long-term stability of the yuan remains uncertain. Trump’s proposed tariffs on Chinese imports also put a lot of pressure on the yuan. The 10% duty on Chinese goods starting March 4 caused market jitters, causing a sell-off in Bitcoin, which fell over 5% to $79,125 (the lowest science November 2023). Ether also tumbled more than 5% to $2,099 (a 13-month low), while the Australian dollar dropped 0.4%, reaching a three-week low. Investors looking for alternative options amid rate cuts As dollar deposits fall, investors explore alternative assets to hedge against possible inflation, and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin stand out. Because of its decentralized nature and limited supply, Bitcoin is seen as “digital gold,” making it a good hedge against inflation and the depreciating yuan. The weaker yuan and reduced incentives to hold dollar deposits increased demand for Bitcoin. Before China’s crackdown on cryptocurrency trading in 2021, China was one of the biggest markets for the adoption of Bitcoin, with many investors using it to circumvent capital controls and protect their wealth against inflation. Chinese investors seeking a less volatile currency helped boost demand for stablecoins such as Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), allowing them to keep their access to USD while avoiding the country’s banking system. Despite China’s regulatory crackdown on cryptocurrency trading, the demand for digital assets remains high. Offshore exchanges and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms allow Chinese investors to buy and trade stablecoins despite the tight restrictions. If the yuan weakens further and global economic conditions remain unstable, there will be an explosive demand for cryptocurrency as a hedge against inflation, currency devaluation, and geopolitical uncertainty. Still, Chinese arthritis may force stricter capital controls or increase regulatory oversight to prevent large-scale outflows into digital assets. China’s financial system remains fragile due to the ongoing U.S.-China trade tensions, a broadening yield gap, and domestic economic concerns. The coming months will show whether PBOC’s measures to lower U.S. deposit rates will successfully redirect capital into the yuan or if investors will continue to hedge using alternative assets.

SEC Officially Withdraws Securities Lawsuit Against Coinbase,https://zycrypto.com/ripple-next-sec-officially-withdraws-securities-lawsuit-against-coinbase/,"Coinbase is in the clear after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) followed through on its agreement and voluntarily dropped its enforcement case against the crypto exchange. The move further distances the Commission from its previous stance that the vast majority of crypto tokens were securities requiring registration. Coinbase Lawsuit Dropped On Thursday, the SEC officially requested to toss out its case against one of the largest crypto companies in the US without prejudice, meaning the regulator could not change its mind later. “The Commission’s decision to exercise its discretion and dismiss this pending enforcement action rests on its judgement that the dismissal will facilitate the Commission’s ongoing efforts to reform and renew its regulatory approach to the crypto industry, not on any assessment of the merits of the claims alleged in the action,” the SEC said in a statement. Though Coinbase announced last week that the SEC had agreed in principle to end the legal dispute , the commissioners had to vote to request a judge dismiss the case. https://twitter.com/coinbase/status/1895225038443552858 The lawsuit against Coinbase dates back to June 2023, when the SEC sued Coinbase just two years after the exchange went public. The regulator at the time accused Coinbase of violating U.S. securities laws by operating an unregistered exchange. New Task Force, New Rules After the exit of crypto foe chair Gary Gensler , the temporary chair appointed by President Donald Trump, Mark Uyeda , started reshaping the agency to be increasingly pro-crypto. Uyeda named fellow Republican Commissioner Hester Peirce to lead the SEC’s new crypto task force. “It’s time for the commission to rectify its approach and develop crypto policy in a more transparent manner. The Crypto Task Force is designed to do just that.” SEC Acting Chair Uyeda posited on Thursday. The statement marks the first public comments from the SEC clarifying why it has decided, over the past two weeks, to end lawsuits and probes into some of the crypto industry’s top players, including Robinhood, Uniswap Labs, OpenSea, and Consensys. Experts speculate that the regulatory agency will soon abandon its controversial appeal in the Ripple case.",Cryptocurrency|News|Coinbase|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|UNI,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-02-28 13:49:06

One project gaining traction is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi lending platform that offers real financial utility. While ADA remains under pressure, MUTM’s strong presale performance and growing adoption suggest it could be a more rewarding opportunity. Currently priced at just $0.015, MUTM has already attracted thousands of holders, with analysts predicting it could reach $1 in the coming months. Its decentralized lending system, passive income potential, and structured tokenomics are driving investor confidence. As Cardano holders seek stronger opportunities, many are turning to MUTM for its growth potential. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Without the use of middlemen, users can lend and receive cryptocurrency assets thanks to Mutuum Finance’s decentralized lending system. With APY rates that vary based on market conditions, users who provide liquidity can earn passive income by depositing assets like USDT, ETH, or DAI. For instance, an investor may benefit from steady interest accrual over time by providing $2,000 DAI to the platform’s liquidity pools without needing to trade actively. This arrangement makes it a desirable choice for people who wish to enhance their holdings while maintaining flexibility. On the borrowing side, users can access liquidity without selling their holdings by locking assets as collateral. There’s no fixed repayment schedule, and borrowers only need to pay interest based on APY, making it a flexible way to unlock funds without sacrificing long-term investments. This system ensures constant demand for the protocol, further supporting MUTM’s price appreciation over time. Mutuum Finance’s key drivers for growth One of the biggest factors expected to push MUTM’s price higher is its buy-and-distribute mechanism. Long-term holders will profit from steady buy pressure created by the platform’s repurchase of MUTM tokens, which are then given to mtToken stakers using a portion of its revenue. This strategy guarantees consistent demand for the token, enhancing its long-term worth. To provide even more safety and usefulness to its ecosystem, Mutuum Finance is also getting ready to launch an overcollateralized stablecoin. The stablecoin is a crucial component of the lending protocol since it will enable users to mint a decentralized digital asset supported by on-chain collateral. Long-term acceptance of MUTM is increased by this new capabilities, which establishes it as a complete DeFi solution. Why investors are turning to MUTM With a structured roadmap that includes a beta version launch alongside its token listing, Mutuum Finance is proving its commitment to delivering a functional platform from day one. This sets it apart from many other presale tokens that often launch without a working product. Given its strong fundamentals, analysts expect MUTM to experience a 20x to 30x surge post-launch, with some predicting it could surpass $1 within months. When MUTM hits $1, a $2,200 investment at the current presale price may increase to $146,000, demonstrating its massive upside potential. A $100,000 giveaway is being held by Mutuum Finance to give investors the opportunity to win free tokens and contribute to the expansion of the business. As the platform gets traction, this program aims to incentivize community involvement and reward early users. The official website provides information on eligibility and entry requirements, as well as details on how to participate. Investors are turning to initiatives like Mutuum Finance, which provide genuine value, chances for passive income, and robust growth potential, as Cardano faces to hold onto its position. With a well-defined development plan and a quickly expanding presale, MUTM is becoming one of the most promising investments of 2025.

The risk-on trades that exploded in the wake of Trump’s election seem like an age ago and the warnings of bears at the time are prescient. In December last year, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz predicted the crypto market would see “one, if not two, vicious retracements, which will test your soul.” We are now in the midst of that correction, and we are overshooting Novogratz’s penciled $85k number. Things could get a whole lot worse than $85k, as we saw earlier today when bitcoin fell to as low as $78k. Here’s the nightmare scenario: long-time crypto skeptic Peter Schiff thinks bitcoin could revisit the $50,000 level: It looks like there is a high probability that at a minimum Bitcoin drops back into the $50K – 60K range, just below MSTR's average cost. Why is there so much complacency? pic.twitter.com/edztoFGbTv — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) February 26, 2025 If $50k comes to pass it will prove Novogrtaz wrong in one of his other predictions, when he said bitcoin would never go below $55,000 again . The real panic may be ahead of us… Looking to the near future, Mark Cudmore, from Bloomberg’s Markets Live team, puts it like this: “The real panic may be ahead of us still. Bitcoin always has another 70%+ crash in its future, by construction. $72k-$74k would appear to be the technical crunch zone that might trigger the next crypto winter.“ But to fully understand crypto’s current predicament, we have to admit that Trump 2.0 may well be the worst thing that ever happened to crypto. Trump 2.0 wasn’t meant to be like this – the downside of moving fast and breaking things Most economists agree that tariffs are a terrible idea, but Trump’s Truth Social pronouncements this week show that he intends to stay the course. Forlorn hopes that the 10% tariff on China would be the end of the matter appear to be wishful thinking. Likewise, the hope that the 25% tariffs on all Canadian and Mexican imports into the US would be postponed indefinitely may turn out to be a false hope too. Together, China, Mexico, and Canada account for 40% of US trade, and the Trump administration seems intent on destroying the underpinning carefully honed supply chains it has taken decades to assemble. A similar story of ‘uncreative destruction’ is emerging courtesy of Elon Musk’s DOGE . It looks like a bunch of kids think that the Federal government is the same thing as a tech startup or even a Big Tech a la Facebook/Meta, where you can “move fast and break things”, as newly minted MAGA Tech Bro Mark Zuckerburg. Once legacy systems are broken, and the people who knew about them are fired, it might be difficult to repair the damage, let alone improve on the systems, as was apparently the original intention. So now we have measles outbreaks in Texas; this week alone two aircraft had to abort their landings because of the risk of an in-flight collision; farmers who voted for Trump are losing their farms; Federal workers who voted Trump are losing their jobs; bird flu is running rampant but the vaccine research funding to stop it in its tracks is being cut off, and so it goes on. Back with the macro bigger picture – the much-vaunted GOP tax cuts could increase the US deficit by $4 trillion, which is surely the kind of “fiscal folly” that Warren Buffett had in mind in his most recent letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, warning that “paper money can see its value evaporate”: “In some countries, this reckless practice has become habitual, and, in our country’s short history, the U.S. has come close to the edge. Fixed-coupon bonds provide no protection against runaway currency,” Buffett said. Warren Buffett in letter to shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Fiat’s inherent flaws will be crypto’s opportunity, but it doesn’t dispel the fear among the crypto donors to the Trump project that now that the votes are in, it’s time to gut Medicaid and deny benefits to Vets. Trump and Musk may soon find out that MAGA scorned can be a dangerous thing – for more on that, visit the LeopardsAteMyFace reddit for your daily diet of complaints from the disappointed and enraged. And we haven’t even mentioned the price of eggs, or today’s data drop of the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE). Stagflation is entering the lexicon of economic commentators for good reason. Trump 2.0 delivers institutional entanglement and that could make this bitcoin price crash the worst ever Of course, where crypto is concerned, the personnel has changed at various government agencies, and SEC lawsuits have been dropped, but nothing else of consequence has actually happened except the setting up of a task force to discuss establishing a crypto framework. Actually, it is not quite true that nothing much has happened in Trump 2.0 so far. Sure, the strategic reserve hasn’t happened but some other stuff has – like the biggest-ever hack in crypto history over at Bybit (thank you North Korea – maybe that’s why the US voted with North Korea on the Ukraine war at the United Nations?) and the $LIBRA scam , not to mention Trump’s naked grifting in the meme coin space , which left a sour taste in the mouth and arguably was the portend of the doom-times to come. However, the really big thing that has happened is in the financial plumbing – institutions have cozied up to crypto in ways that mean the fates of the equity markets and the crypto are more entwined than ever before. That was fine when the ‘Magnificent Seven’ were the Prometheus Unbound of the stock market, but not so much when Nvidia’s stock price plummets 8% in one session, as it did on Thursday. Hedge funds have been playing in cryptoland for a while, but they have become more enmeshed of late. One of their favorite trades – the carry trade to farm yield – is unraveling before our eyes, adding fuel to the fire. Bitcoin is crashing. Wondering why? The cash & carry trade that’s been suppressing BTC’s price is now unwinding. Here’s how it worked—and why its collapse is sending shockwaves through the market. — Kyle Chassé / DD (@kyle_chasse) February 27, 2025 MicroStrategy has a strategy that highlights everything that’s bad about leverage in crypto For a front-row seat on how the marriage of TradFi and crypto will play out over the next few days, weeks and months, cast your eyes upon MicroStrategy (now renamed Strategy). Down more than 50% from its highs, Strategy is a leveraged bet on bitcoin. The problem with leverage, though, is that it can be wickedly damaging when the market moves against you, and that can happen very quickly. So far in 2025, $MSTR has spent $5.3 billion buying Bitcoin. But despite all that buying, the price of Bitcoin is down by 13% this year. Think about how much lower the price of Bitcoin would be without @Saylor buying. Now think about how much lower Bitcoin would be if he sold! — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) February 27, 2025 By way of an example of the downside of excessive leverage, check out the performance of MicroStrategy 2x leveraged ETFs: In one stark example, two levered ETFs tied to Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin-hoarding company Strategy, which were together worth more than $5 billion at one point, are down about 40% in three days. Bloomberg That was written three days ago. The situation has deteriorated markedly since then. Yesterday, the T-Rex 2X Long MSTR Daily Target ETF (MSTU) fell 17.66%. Its three-month return is -72%. Ouch. From its all-time high, it is down 85%. Since 20 February $3.133 billion has exited bitcoin ETFs and that is likely to accelerate today. With Michael Saylor controlling 46% of the voting shares at Strategy, there is some protection against forced liquidation for shareholders and bondholders, but not if bitcoin keeps falling. Still, the good news in all this mayhem is that the bitcoin price always eventually bounces back to make higher highs. It means if you went into cash (or USDT, assuming it holds its dollar peg) at the right time, then you may soon(ish) be able to buy back in and make a killing. Or if you plan to hold on for dear life, sit back and chill… Crypto might be in trouble right now, but fiat is in an even bigger bind. Dips are a part of free markets. Not financial advice. If you are stressed about it, you probably should reduce your investment size. (That is, if you view crypto as an investment.) For me, it's a worldview shift. I exited the old world 11 years ago. https://t.co/5zzRAMB4YC — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) February 28, 2025 All the money that has been sitting on the sidelines with retail and institutions will, with patience, have the opportunity they’ve been waiting for.

Crypto Markets Tumble Into A Sea Of Red BTC fell below the $80,000 level for the first time since November 10 amid growing macroeconomic tension over U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposed trade tariffs. The leading crypto asset plunged to as low as $78,393, according to CoinGecko data. At press time, the price had bounced a hair to $79,330, lower by 8% over the past 24 hours. BTC is now roughly 30% since reaching its January peak of above $108,700. The wider crypto market has slumped to $2.73 trillion, down 9.5% over the last 24 hours. Ethereum (ETH), the industry’s second-biggest crypto asset, is down 10.5% to $2,109 — a more than 14-month low. Dogecoin and Cardano have been the hardest hit altcoins among the top 10 by market cap, both falling 11.2% during the day, CoinGecko data shows. Ripple-promoted cryptocurrency XRP also saw a double-digit drop, while Solana (SOL) dipped 8.5%. More than $932 million in crypto-leveraged positions were liquidated over the past 24 hours, according to data from Coinglass, indicating forced selling further contributed to the bloodbath. $70,000 Is Now A Possibility According to Wolfe Research, the foremost crypto could fall to $70,000 if it does not strongly rebound above the $90,000 mark. Wolfe analyst Read Harvey warned that breaking below the key $91,000 support indicated a bearish turn. “$91,000 acted as the floor over the past several months. With that level now decisively taken out, anything less than another V-shaped oversold response would send a very bearish message. So far not so good,” Harvey reportedly told CNBC. Bitcoin hasn’t traded at the $70,000 price level since Nov. 5, after election polling results looked favorable for pro-crypto Trump. However, investor sentiment hit after President Trump announced on Thursday that tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports would move forward as planned, doubling the 10% universal tariff charged on imports from China. The president’s move reignited concerns over inflation and economic growth, weighing on risk assets like crypto. Meanwhile, pseudonymous crypto analyst Rager is not fretting over the crash. The analyst told his 201.6K followers on the X social media platform that it “wouldn’t be abnormal to drop to mid to low $70ks.” “Pretty normal in prior cycles, even during bull markets, for Bitcoin to drop -30% to -40%.

Investors who missed Solana’s record growth—a $200 investment at the time of its $0.05 launch would have increased to $943,000 at its highest point—are now scrambling to capitalize on MUTM’s presale. The token, which is priced at $0.015, has already raised $1.8 million and acquired over 3,400 holders in its second phase. With a prescheduled price jump to $0.02 just around the corner, early investors can realize a 33.3% profit before phase two commences. Bigger returns post-launch are what analysts are predicating, citing MUTM’s tokenomics and actual real-world use case as the catalyst for a potential 400% surge to its $0.06 listing price. If previous trends are any indicator, this could be the launchpad for a similar stratospheric run experienced by Solana. Presale Momentum Builds Rapidly Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is seeing unprecedented demand as phase two of presale gathers strength. The cumulative size of the project’s raise has increased cumulatively with its first stage selling out sooner than anticipated at a rate set by its token burns from income and its model of decentralized lending. Investors pledging tokens for $0.015 now take their seat with instant profit poised: when their investment rises by a third when price jumps to $0.02 in the next phase, overnight. Aside from presale profits, listing on exchanges at $0.06 today sets today’s purchase price for a 4x return. Market experts indicate this is a lowball estimate, as math after launch puts price exponentially higher than over $5 by 2025—a 33,233% increase above current worth. These figures ring familiar with the early Solana days when strategic entry points built generational wealth. Lending Model Drives Sustainable Demand Unlike speculative hype tokens, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is founded upon strong DeFi utility. Decentralized lending and borrowing of assets are facilitated on the platform with adequately overcollateralized loans that reduce defaults risk and offer liquidity. Asset depositors like ETH or DAI can mint interest-bearing tradable mtTokens with increasing value over time in the long term and tradable across DeFi platforms. In addition to passive income, the system also creates demand for MUTM stably. Borrowers, who are requested to stake collateral of greater value than loans, also stabilize the system. A peer-to-peer lending feature for niche assets like meme coins provides flexibility, increasing MUTM’s user base. These mechanics provide a self-sustaining economy in which token holders encourage both platform growth and strategic buybacks. Buy Pressure Mechanism Fuels Long-Term Growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) integrates a novel buy-and-distribute mechanism with the offer of evergreen demand. A fraction of platform charges is utilized to purchase tokens in the market, which are re-distributed among mtToken stakers. The two mechanisms incentivize long-term holding and sequentially reduce circulating supply—a combination historically linked with increases in price. Accompanied by a $100,000 presale tokens that rewards early bird investors, the strategy creates a sense of urgency for investors. The deflationary nature and scarcity of the token are the very opposite of inflationary alternatives, and as a result, MUTM is a hedge against market volatility. With increasing adoption, compounding staking rewards and burning tokens can provide supply shocks to push prices up regardless of underlying market conditions. The window to purchase MUTM for $0.015 closes rapidly. With phase two about to reach its crescendo and listings on exchanges pending, dilly-dallying will cause a generational entry point to pass. Solana early adopters made life-changing gains by winning the utility rush to the masses. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents the same chance—underpinned not by hype, but by a working ecosystem to expand. Asymmetric gain-seeking investors must act before the subsequent price run-up.

As is known, Binance started a vote about 10 days ago on whether PI will be listed on the exchange. As soon as the voting started, the majority of users voted in favor of listing, while the exchange warned in a statement that even if there were a large number of yes votes, this did not mean that PI would definitely be listed. According to the voting results, 86% of the participants voted “yes” to the listing of PI, while only 14% voted “no”. While we are now curiously wondering whether Binance will consider the voting result and list PI, it is stated that a possible Binance listing could significantly increase the credibility, adoption, and price of Pi Coin. Pi Coin Responds to Fraud Allegations! While the Binance listing is eagerly awaited, the Pi team responded to the Bybit listing and Bybit CEO Ben Zhou's fraud allegations. The Pi team denied the claims that their listing offer to the Bybit exchange was rejected by the exchange and stated that they did not make such a request. Bybit CEO Ben Zhou also claimed that Pi Coin is a scam. “Yes, I still think you are a scam and no, Bybit will not list scams,” Zhou said. The Pi team has no ties to Bybit and its CEO, and has stated that they have not received any warnings or been contacted by Chinese authorities. *This is not investment advice.

The bull run may persist until at least April 2025, argues CryptoQuant CEO, Ki Young Ju. Should this be the case, it could signal the longest ever Bitcoin bull cycle. Related Reading: Dogecoin Sees 95% Drop In Network Activity—Trouble Ahead?

Right now, Bitcoin is in what he refers to as a “critical zone,” in which market signals combine bullish and bearish patterns.

But Ju is not bothered. According to him, severe pullbacks like these are not uncommon during a bull cycle phase. Historical records support his assertion; earlier bull runs show price losses of up to 52% before recovery. Should history be the barometer, Bitcoin might still have some surprises in its sleeves and carry out strong upward moves in the face of a volatile market. The BlackRock Bitcoin Selloff Movement in Bitcoin price is much influenced by institutional investors. BlackRock lately sold roughly $70 million in ether and $440 million in bitcoin. These big sell-offs could cause temporary devaluations and change investor mood. These events could change the price direction of Bitcoin in the next months even if Ju is optimistic. What’s Next For The Alpha Coin? Meanwhile, Bitcoin is not in good form as we speak: it is languishing in the $79,900 level, to the delight of those who’ve been waiting to buy the dip. Bitcoin is trading 7% below its most recent closing. It peaked at $86,990 then fell to a low of $79,490. The bulls can only wish it was the other way around.

Utah is one step ahead in this regard. The Senate Committee on Revenue and Taxation of the state passed the document on February 20. Now the bill will be considered in the second and third reading before the final vote in the Senate. In 18 states, similar initiatives are awaiting votes. Arizona and Utah are already in the final stages of approval. The bill, which received support in Arizona's upper chamber of Congress, limits the amount the Treasury can invest in a single transaction. It also authorizes lending digital assets for profit as long as it doesn't increase financial risk. Texas On Feb. 27, the Texas Senate Banking Committee passed the SBR bill, with the next step being consideration in the state's upper chamber of Congress. The document gives the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts the authority to purchase, sell and exchange any assets. The Texas bitcoin strategic reserve bill has gotten a new revision. Its first version envisioned the ability to purchase bitcoin in January 2025, but senators included other digital assets in February 2025. The prospects for the U.S. bitcoin reserve remain unclear The community expected US President Donald Trump to make the decision to create a strategic bitcoin reserve (SBR) among the first decisions after returning to the White House on January 20. This was one of the politician's campaign promises. The head of state created a working group on digital asset markets under the leadership of “cryptocurrency king” David Sachs. The latter called the evaluation of the initiative a priority, but did not provide any details. Some experts called the administration's cautious approach regarding the crypto reserve one of the factors that could “sell” bitcoin below $90,000. “Evaluate or study is what Washington does when it has no intention of addressing the issue,” commented Bianco Research president and macro strategist Jim Bianco. In December 2024, Satoshi Action Fund CEO Dennis Porter promised to organize a “wave of SBR” at the state level in case the central government did not rush the initiative. In January, MARA Holdings, the largest publicly traded U.S. miner, joined the lobbying effort to implement bitcoin reserves in the regions. Related bills have been put forward in many states, including Utah, South Dakota, Illinois, Ohio, Arizona, Utah, Texas and several others. In Montana, Pennsylvania, North and South Dakota, and Wyoming, legislative initiatives failed. Recall, the purchase of the first cryptocurrency in the national bitcoin reserve for $1 billion will lead to an increase in the capitalization of the asset by $20 billion, according to Sygnum calculations.

Investors entering now stand to gain a 33% increase when the next phase begins at $0.02, with a 300% return anticipated at its $0.06 exchange listing. Analysts suggest post-launch momentum could push MUTM to $3, a 10,760% surge, as its decentralized lending platform goes live. Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) and Cardano (ADA) show bullish signals, reigniting debates about their potential to hit $150,000 and $2.5, respectively. Bitcoin eyes $150,000 amid market shifts Bitcoin hovers near $84,000 as technical patterns hint at a breakout. Analysts tracking USDT dominance and the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) note similarities to past cycles where BTC surged after consolidation. A key Fibonacci level at $90,000 now acts as support, with a rebound likely propelling it toward $150,000 in 2025. However, risks loom: proposed US stablecoin regulations may force Tether to liquidate part of its $8 billion Bitcoin reserves, potentially triggering short-term volatility. Despite this, long-term sentiment remains bullish, driven by institutional adoption and Bitcoin’s finite supply. Cardano’s double bottom signals rebound potential Cardano (ADA) stabilizes at $0.70 after forming a double-bottom pattern, a classic bullish indicator. Speculation around founder Charles Hoskinson’s upcoming VIP meeting fuels optimism, with rumors suggesting talks could involve Elon Musk or government blockchain integration. A breakout above $0.82 might confirm upward momentum, targeting $1. Yet risks persist: delayed meetings, unknown VIP identities, or underwhelming outcomes could stall recovery. ADA’s ecosystem growth, including rising decentralized app activity, offers fundamental support for a 2025 rebound. Mutuum Finance presale gains momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enters its second presale phase at $0.015, drawing rapid investor interest. Over $1.7 million has been secured, reflecting confidence in its decentralized lending model. Early participants in the current phase will see immediate gains as prices rise incrementally toward the $0.06 listing target. With 3,200 holders already onboard, the project emphasizes accessibility, allowing users to lend assets or borrow against collateral without selling holdings. The platform’s tokenomics incentivize long-term holding. A buy-and-distribute mechanism uses fees to repurchase MUTM from exchanges, redistributing tokens to stakers. This creates constant buy pressure, supporting price stability post-launch. Additionally, the planned release of an overcollateralized stablecoin, backed by on-chain reserves, will enhance borrowing utility, driving demand for MUTM as the ecosystem expands. Mutuum Finance presale: key details Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues its presale momentum, with Phase 2 offering tokens at $0.015. Over $1.7 million has been secured from 3,200 holders, underscoring investor confidence. The next phase will see prices rise to $0.02, a 33% jump for current buyers, before listing at $0.06, promising a 300% return. Limited availability in this phase urges swift action to capitalize on presale pricing before upward adjustments. Post-launch projections of $3 further highlight its growth potential, positioning MUTM as a high-opportunity entry in decentralized finance. Platform launch and future projections Mutuum Finance aims to launch its beta platform alongside exchange listings, ensuring immediate utility upon release. Early adopters benefit from the lowest entry price, with experts forecasting a rise to $3 as adoption grows. A $100,000 giveaway campaign further boosts engagement, rewarding community participation. Compared to Bitcoin’s volatility and Cardano’s speculative triggers, MUTM’s structured approach offers a tangible path to growth, blending DeFi innovation with measurable milestones. As Bitcoin navigates regulatory headwinds and Cardano awaits partnership clarity, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emerges as a timely opportunity. Its presale combines accessible pricing with clear growth mechanisms, positioning it to outperform broader market trends. For investors seeking assets with near-term catalysts and high-yield potential, MUTM’s presale phase remains a decisive entry point.

40962088,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24834,1740751365,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/99/default.png,What Can We Learn from the Bybit Hack?,https://blog.bitfinex.com/education/what-can-we-learn-from-the-bybit-hack/,"The Bybit hack, the largest cryptocurrency theft in history, saw $1.46 billion stolen through malware that manipulated the exchange’s transaction approvals, with North Korea’s Lazarus Group identified as the likely culprit. The hackers swiftly laundered funds using decentralised exchanges, cross-chain bridges, and crypto-mixing services like Tornado Cash to obscure their tracks, complicating recovery efforts despite blockchain forensics firms freezing some assets. Beyond this incident, sanctioned entities and cybercriminals still try to exploit cryptocurrencies to bypass financial controls in order to fund illicit activities through anonymous transactions and no-KYC platforms. While cryptocurrencies offer financial sovereignty and censorship resistance, their role is subverted by bad actors who use them to facilitate illicit finance, presenting an ongoing challenge for governments, and highlighting the difficulty of reversing the profound financial disruption introduced by blockchain technology. An Overview of the Largest Hack in History On February 21, 2025, Bybit, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange, based in Dubai, suffered a major security breach resulting in the theft of approximately $1.46 billion worth of digital assets. The attack was reportedly carried out using a sophisticated form of malware that manipulated Bybit’s transaction approval process, allowing unauthorised transfers to an external wallet controlled by the perpetrators. This incident marks the largest crypto theft ever recorded, surpassing previous high-profile breaches both in the cryptocurrency industry as well as in the broader financial industry. Blockchain security firms, including Elliptic and Arkham Intelligence, have attributed the attack to the Lazarus Group , a cybercriminal organization linked to North Korea. The group has a well-documented history of targeting cryptocurrency platforms, having stolen billions in digital assets over the years. Following their established laundering pattern, the attackers quickly converted the stolen Ether (ETH) to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. They then distributed the funds across multiple wallets, leveraging Decentralised Exchanges (DEXs), cross-chain bridges, and other obfuscation techniques to hinder tracking efforts. The scale of this attack has raised concerns over security vulnerabilities within some centralised cryptocurrency exchanges. A key factor that enabled the exploit was the compromise of Bybit’s multi-signature wallet system through an attack that deceived signers into approving fraudulent transactions. Preventative measures that could have mitigated the breach include stricter access controls, enhanced authentication protocols, improved monitoring of transaction anomalies, and the use of more than one air-gapped cold storage for high-value assets. Keeping $1.4 billion of Ethereum in a single wallet, could be considered a significant central point of failure. Additionally, more rigorous cybersecurity training for employees handling critical transactions could have potentially helped prevent social engineering tactics from being successful. In response to the breach, Bybit has worked closely with blockchain forensics firms and law enforcement agencies to track and recover the stolen funds. A portion of the assets has already been frozen by cryptocurrency service providers that flagged suspicious transactions. Meanwhile, Bybit has assured its users that it will absorb the losses and continue processing withdrawals without disruption. This incident underscores the persistent threat of cyberattacks on cryptocurrency platforms and highlights the need for industry-wide improvements in security infrastructure to safeguard against increasingly sophisticated threats. Illicit Funds Still on the Move Following the theft, the attackers began executing a sophisticated laundering operation to obscure the origin of the stolen assets and prevent their recovery. The first step involved converting the stolen tokens, such as stETH and mETH, into ETH through DEXs. This move was likely intended to avoid potential intervention from token issuers who could freeze the compromised assets. Unlike centralised exchanges, which require identity verification, DEXs operate without intermediaries, making them an effective tool for laundering illicit funds. Once the assets were converted to ETH, the hackers employed a common laundering technique known as “layering” to obfuscate their transaction trail. The funds were distributed across hundreds of intermediary wallets, each receiving relatively small amounts to make tracking more complex. The attackers then leveraged cross-chain bridges to move assets between different blockchain networks, further complicating forensic analysis. This tactic is frequently used by cybercriminals to take advantage of the fragmented oversight across different blockchain ecosystems, making it harder for investigators to track stolen funds. Approximately $335 million of the stolen $1.46 billion from Bybit has already been laundered through decentralized exchanges, cross-chain bridges, and crypto-mixing services, leaving around $900 million still in the hacker’s control. Another laundering method used by the hackers involved sending portions of the stolen ETH to crypto-mixing services, such as Tornado Cash or similar platforms. These services break the link between sender and recipient by pooling multiple transactions and redistributing them in a way that obscures the source of the funds. While blockchain transactions are inherently transparent, mixing services introduce an additional layer of anonymity, making it extremely difficult for investigators to trace the illicit funds back to their origin. The attackers also engaged in “peel chain” transactions, a technique where funds are continuously moved through multiple addresses in small increments to gradually integrate them back into the broader crypto ecosystem. Despite these sophisticated efforts, blockchain analytics firms and law enforcement agencies have been actively tracking the stolen funds, identifying and flagging wallets involved in the laundering process. Several cryptocurrency service providers have responded by freezing assets linked to the hackers, limiting their ability to cash out. However, a significant portion of the stolen funds remains in circulation, and the hackers are likely to continue employing various laundering techniques over the coming weeks to move their remaining holdings undetected. The ongoing investigation highlights both the effectiveness of blockchain forensic tools and the persistent challenge of combating financial crime in the decentralised space. As Crypto Adoption Increases, Authorities are Less Able to Control the Movement of Funds Beyond the Bybit hack, various threat actors, including state-sponsored cybercriminal groups and sanctioned entities, have increasingly turned to cryptocurrency as a means of bypassing financial restrictions. These actors exploit the pseudonymous nature of blockchain transactions, DEXs, and cross-chain bridges to move funds outside the oversight of regulated financial institutions. Countries under international sanctions, such as North Korea, Iran, and Russia , have been linked to illicit crypto transactions, using these digital assets to finance state operations, including military programs and espionage efforts. The ability to operate outside traditional banking networks enables these actors to evade restrictions imposed by the global financial system, making cryptocurrency a powerful tool for circumventing anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) regulations. One of the primary methods used to obscure illicit financial flows is the use of mixing services and coin-swapping platforms that facilitate anonymous asset transfers. Tumblers like Tornado Cash have been widely utilised by cybercriminals and sanctioned entities to obfuscate transaction trails, making it difficult for blockchain analysts to trace illicit funds back to their source. Additionally, no-KYC exchanges and peer-to-peer marketplaces provide further opportunities for bad actors to cash out stolen or sanctioned funds with minimal oversight. These platforms operate in jurisdictions with lax regulatory enforcement, allowing users to trade large sums of cryptocurrency without the scrutiny imposed by compliant financial institutions. Cross-chain bridging has also emerged as a significant challenge for financial regulators, as it allows sanctioned entities to transfer funds across different blockchain networks while evading detection. By leveraging DeFi protocols, illicit actors can convert and move assets between networks, complicating efforts to freeze or track illicitly obtained funds. Some sanctioned entities have even been known to utilise their own blockchain-based financial infrastructure, issuing stablecoins or digital assets to maintain liquidity and conduct international transactions outside the reach of traditional financial oversight. The growing sophistication of these tactics has prompted regulatory bodies to intensify their scrutiny of the crypto industry and push for stricter compliance measures. Despite these efforts, the borderless and decentralised nature of cryptocurrency continues to pose a major obstacle for enforcement agencies attempting to crack down on illicit financial flows. Threat actors, including ransomware groups, darknet marketplaces, and cybercrime syndicates, have increasingly adopted cryptocurrency to facilitate payments and launder illicit earnings. The lack of centralised control and the ability to transact without intermediaries make it difficult for governments and regulators to impose effective restrictions. While advancements in blockchain analytics and forensic tools have led to greater detection capabilities, the continuous adaptation of money laundering techniques by sanctioned entities and cybercriminals demonstrates the persistent cat-and-mouse dynamic between regulators and illicit actors in the digital financial ecosystem. The rise of decentralised financial technologies, particularly cryptocurrencies, has fundamentally altered the relationship between governments and monetary control, effectively enabling a “separation of money from state.” While initially heralded as a means of financial sovereignty and resistance to censorship, this shift has also produced unintended consequences that challenge global regulatory frameworks. Cryptocurrencies have created an alternative financial system that operates beyond state oversight, allowing sanctioned entities, cybercriminals, and rogue actors to move funds outside traditional banking networks. This decentralisation has weakened the ability of governments to enforce economic sanctions, implement capital controls, and regulate illicit financial flows, making it increasingly difficult to contain the influence of unauthorised actors. With no central authority able to fully control blockchain transactions, this paradigm shift resembles a Pandora’s box, once opened, it is nearly impossible to reverse. As the financial landscape continues to evolve, policymakers and regulators face an ongoing dilemma: how to mitigate the risks posed by decentralised money without undermining the core innovations that have redefined global finance.

Bitcoin price crashed below $80,000, while altcoins have done worse. This article explores some of the top crypto to sell after an expert warned of a BTC crunch zone. Crypto to Sell After Expert Warned of a $72k Bitcoin Price Crunch Zone Mark Cudmore, a Bloomberg strategist warned that the ongoing panic may lead to a 70% crash in its future. He expects that the coin will find some support between $72k and $74k. He added : “The real panic may be ahead of us still. Bitcoin always has another 70%+ crash in its future, by construction. $72k-$74k would appear to be the technical crunch zone that might trigger the next crypto winter.“ This statement means that some investors may consider selling some cryptocurrencies like IOTA (IOTA), Solana (SOL), and Ethereum (ETH). IOTA (IOTA) IOTA price has crashed from $0.6361 in December to $0.1895 even as the network prepares for its rebased upgrade. The coin has crashed below the key support at $0.4188, the highest swing in March last year. Worse, the coin is about to form a death cross pattern as the spread between the 50-day and 200-day moving averages cross each other. The ADX indicator, which is used to measure the strength of a trend, has risen to 36. Therefore, the coin will likely continue falling as sellers target the support at $0.1038, the lowest level in 2024, down by 45% below the current level. This makes it one of the top crypto to sell to avoid further losses. IOTA price Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum is another altcoin to sell. It has formed a death cross pattern on the daily chart, risking more downward momentum. ETH has also moved below the key support at $2,150, the neckline of the triple-top chart pattern around the $4,000 resistance level. A triple top is made up of three peaks and a neckline and is a popular reversal sign. More downside is confirmed when it moves below the neckline. The distance of this triple-top pattern and the neckline means that the Ethereum price may crash to near $1,000. Ethereum Price Solana (SOL) Solana is another top crypto to sell ahead of the crypto winter. It has become a toxic asset as the top Solana meme coins have crashed, leading to substantial losses. SOL price has dropped below the support at $170, the lowest swing on January 13. It is also about to form a death cross pattern, pointing to a further downside. The key level to watch will be at $110, the lowest swing in August, followed by $100. Solana Price Other Altcoins to Sell The other crucial crypto to sell are Solana meme coins like Fartcoin, Melania, and Peanut the Squirrel, and Goatseus Maximus.

It promised a decentralized, user-centric ecosystem where individuals could take back control of their data, finances, and social interactions, while potentially being rewarded for doing so thanks to unique token economics. Now, a decade later, as the dust settles, a provocative new thesis is emerging – Web3 was never really built for humans – its architecture was predestined for AI agents. Whether intentional or accidental, the notion seems quite fitting considering the never-ending Web3 conundrum of UX being the main hurdle to mass adoption. So there you have it – all we need to do is take humans out of the equation and Web3 is hurdle-free. All of a sudden Web3’s additional complexities, like trustless transactions, decentralized infrastructure, and inherent programmability, seem far better suited for AI-to-AI interactions. Take a step back to assess this idea and you’ll find it hard to argue that Web3’s architecture looks like it was designed for a future where AI agents are the primary drivers of economic activity. The AI-to-AI Transaction Paradigm The shift from human-centric to AI-driven economic interactions has been underway for some time now. In this new paradigm, transactions won’t be initiated, negotiated, or executed by humans (or businesses), but rather by autonomous AI agents working on their behalf. Imagine a world where your AI assistant can haggle and barter with another AI to get you the best price for a particular service or product. In that world, it’s easy to see how AI agents could quickly take over entire supply chains, operating rapidly and collaboratively over decentralized networks. These would be the first signs of a new AI economy model, one with scalable microtransactions and dynamic real-time pricing systems. And it’s not a far-fetched reality. These AI-to-AI transactions are already happening. The implications are profound. AI agents don’t need a lunch break or to sleep eight hours a night – they’re on 24/7. They don’t have trouble balancing monumental data loads, executing precise transactions, or managing hundreds or thousands of interactions simultaneously. But, what they do need is infrastructure, and that appears to be Web3’s important role. Exploring the Architectural Alignments It’s hard to argue against the case that Web3’s foundational traits make it uniquely suited for the AI economy. Starting with trustless transactions, it’s becoming more and more apparent that AI agents thrive in environments where trust is fully codified and verified, not just assumed. In addition, DLT ensures that AI agents don’t need intermediaries or third-party verification to do their finest work. Fully decentralized systems, where no single entity has control, are also optimal for AI agents. Here, with distributed architecture to enjoy, they can act and move freely, released from the shackles and bottlenecks of centralized gatekeepers, even if there are still instances where autonomy is not a given for some agents like Truth’s Terminal. It is also here that they are able to execute complex transactions autonomously, across all platforms, protocols, and chains, potentially forming the backbone of the new AI economy. The idea is simple: let AI agents roam all available avenues to get the best results. This is what Outlier Ventures calls “The Post Web” in a recent report , while also predicting that, “In The Post Web’s Intention Economy; intent-based AI agents prioritise users’ true needs, aligning counterparties with user intentions and enabling efficient, value-driven interactions with minimal extraction and rent seeking.” Sounds exciting? Because it truly is. The Revolution Will Be Found On-Chain It’s no longer a theoretical future where the onchain environment is the go-to playground for AI agents, especially those focused on trading. Right across the DeFi landscape, protocols are rapidly updating their infrastructure to accommodate AI-driven interactions. In fact, many cryptocurrency projects that previously had nothing to do with AI agents are now making pivots into the space, competing with established AI developments for mind and market share. To keep up, DeFi projects must develop be AI-Agent-ready and they’re already exploring ways to do that via APIs and SDKs. There is an accelerating demand for infrastructure that can support AI agents as they begin to interact directly with blockchain networks on activities like automated trading and decentralized governance. It’s not enough to be human-friendly anymore. AI-friendly is the new instruction. The Future Outlook The future of Web3 is one where AI agents dominate economic activity. Shifting to that future, however, will involve brand new challenges and opportunities. On one hand you have serious questions about accountability, governance, and the human workforce in a machine-dominated world, while on the other you have the perks of unprecedented efficiency and innovation. Now, whether by accident or design, the decentralized, trustless, and programmable nature of Web3 is perfect for the AI future. Outlier Ventures neatly summarizes the situation, stating, “We can look at a decade of Web3 as a battle hardening of a human-tested stack of distributed architecture and incentive games from smart contracts, token economics, DAOs, and DeFi. While too complex for people themselves to operate at scale, the stack is primed for AI and the agentic internet.” All we can do now is understand where we, as users, fit in this new paradigm and watch it play out in real-time.

According to Senator Cynthia Lummis, the US is working on a digital asset legislation that will provide much-needed regulatory clarity. This move will position the US as a major crypto hub and greatly benefit some altcoins. In this article, we discuss 5 altcoins that you can buy today to achieve the American dream and scoop massive profits. 5 Altcoins to Buy to Achieve the American Dream In her recent X post, Senator Lummis stated that a recent Senate hearing had uncovered that most digital assets were not classified as securities under the Howey test. She added that the US would join other countries in formulating laws for digital assets. X Lummis’ statement aligns with the changes that have happened at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the past year. The regulator has dropped lawsuits against multiple companies and established a crypto task force. The SEC also recently declared that meme coins are not securities . As the US becomes one of the most crypto-friendly nations, below are the top 5 altcoins to buy to achieve the American Dream. Ripple (XRP) Ripple (XRP) is the best altcoin to buy to achieve the American dream as it is well-positioned to benefit under a crypto-friendly framework. After the SEC lawsuit, XRP price faced bearish trends until last year when Trump’s election stirred an over 200% rally. The SEC vs. Ripple case is on the verge of a settlement. Once the case ends, XRP will become one of the altcoins with a clear regulatory standing. Speculation is also rife about whether XRP will be added to the national reserve. Polymarket Solana (SOL) The Solana altcoin is also a top altcoin to achieve the American dream. Solana was labeled a security by the previous SEC Chair Gary Gensler in the lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance. The SEC has already shut down the case against Coinbase, which may offer regulatory clarity about Solana. Besides regulations, Solana is also on the verge of a spot ETF approval after the CME futures announced plans to launch Solana futures on its derivatives marketplace. This launch could bode well for Solana price in the future. Cardano (ADA) Grayscale, the largest digital asset manager that was instrumental in getting the SEC to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF, has filed for Cardano ETF. If a spot ADA ETF is approved, it will drive institutional demand for Cardano and fuel a bullish Cardano price prediction . Moreover, ADA’s monthly chart shows a potential double bottom pattern, which may stir a rally past $3, making Cardano one of the top altcoins to buy to achieve the American dream. ADA/USDT: 1-day Chart Litecoin (LTC) Litecoin may become the third altcoin to have a spot ETF in the US according to Bloomberg analysts. The ETF narrative drove a 129% rally for Litecoin price in late 2024 and a similar rally will likely happen if the ETF receives approval. Moreover, LTC is on the verge of breaking a major $140 price hurdle that could push it towards $300. LTC/USDT: 1-day Chart Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink is also one of the top altcoins to buy today. LINK may be on the verge of a breakout due to the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, which is currently negative, suggesting that most traders are sitting in losses. A deeply negative MVRV suggests a potential rebound that outlines a bullish Chainlink price forecast. Chainlink MVRV Final thoughts – Top 5 Altcoins to Buy for the American Dream The top 5 altcoins to buy today to achieve the American dream are XRP, Solana, Cardano, Litecoin, and Chainlink. These altcoins have the potential to rally due to bullish macro factors including a friendly regulatory framework in the US that could drive gains.

Could this economic shock push Bitcoin into another free fall, or is the worst already over? Table of Contents Trump doubles down on tariffs How trade tariffs could set off a chain reaction in crypto How retail and institutional investors could react Where does crypto go from here? Trump doubles down on tariffs Global financial markets are once again in turmoil, with U.S. President Donald Trump’ s latest tariff announcment sending shockwaves across stocks, commodities, and crypto. The U.S. president on Feb. 27 announced a new 10% tariff on Chinese goods—on top of the existing 10% levies—alongside a looming 25% duty on imports from Canada and Mexico. Investors reacted swiftly, hitting the panic button as these measures deepened market uncertainty. The crypto market, already under stress , has experienced a sharp decline . As of Feb. 28, the total market cap has dropped over 8% in the last 24 hours, now sitting at $2.64 trillion—down more than 25% from its $3.52 trillion peak at the start of the month. Total crypto market cap chart | Source: TradingView Bitcoin ( BTC ), the market leader, has also suffered one of its steepest drops in months, plunging nearly 8% to trade around $80,000. At its lowest point, BTC touched $78,200 before staging a modest recovery. BTC 6-months price chart | Source: crypto.news Altcoins have fared even worse, with many seeing double-digit losses as traders rushed to cash out. Ethereum ( ETH ), for instance, has fallen nearly 10%, now hovering around $2,150. This sharp decline follows an earlier wave of tariff fears on Feb. 3, which triggered a similar sell-off. However, diplomatic negotiations provided temporary relief. Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum secured a 30-day pause on the measures, allowing border security talks to continue, particularly regarding U.S. concerns over drug trafficking. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau soon after followed suit. Trump was quick to confirm that tariffs would be delayed as both nations worked to address these concerns. But the relief was short-lived. Trump’s latest comments on Truth Social suggest he remains dissatisfied, accusing both Mexico and Canada of failing to curb the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. With the Mar. 4 deadline fast approaching, tensions are once again at a boiling point, and the tariff pause may soon be lifted. For the crypto market, this comes at an especially fragile moment. Unlike in previous cycles, where Bitcoin and other digital assets traded largely in isolation from traditional markets, the past year has seen a growing correlation with broader macroeconomic forces. What happens next? If these tariffs are implemented, how deep could the next market shock run? And with the crypto market already on edge, could we see another major shake-up in the coming days? Let’s break it down. How trade tariffs could set off a chain reaction in crypto Trade wars are rarely isolated events. They ripple across financial markets, shifting liquidity, reshaping inflation expectations, and forcing central banks to recalibrate their policies. If Trump follows through with his tariffs on Mexico and Canada while also imposing additional 10% levies on China, the outcome could set off a full-scale inflationary shock, putting the Federal Reserve in a tough spot and potentially deepening the sell-off in crypto markets. The core issue is that tariffs act as a tax on imported goods. When businesses face higher costs on foreign products, they don’t absorb the losses—they pass them on to consumers. This leads to a surge in the price of everyday goods, from electronics to food, fueling inflation. With U.S. inflation already above the Fed’s 2% target, hovering around 3% in January, the introduction of additional tariffs could push it even higher, forcing the Fed to reconsider its stance on rate cuts. Here’s where the crypto market comes into play. Bitcoin and digital assets have historically thrived in low-rate environments when excess liquidity drives speculative investments. Increased inflation or dried-up liquidity could trigger market shocks. Moreover, since mid-2023, Bitcoin has been trading more like a risk asset than an inflation hedge, with its correlation to the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 reaching record highs. When stock markets tumble during periods of uncertainty, the cascading effects could dampen crypto momentum. As inflation rises due to trade tariffs and the Fed opts to raise interest rates , liquidity could tighten further as traders flock to the U.S. dollar. The dollar, often seen as the “least risky risky asset,” has recently strengthened to its highest level against the Canadian dollar since 2003, reflecting a broader trend of capital flight away from speculative assets. We’ve already seen a preview of what happens when liquidity dries up. February’s flash crash wiped out nearly $760 billion in just 60 hours, with Bitcoin plunging in sync with other risk assets. If trade tensions trigger another layer of inflationary pressure, we could see a similar scenario unfold, with investors rushing to the safety of the U.S. dollar, gold, and other defensive assets—leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to another sharp decline. How retail and institutional investors could react The market’s reaction to tariffs wouldn’t just hinge on inflation; it would also be driven by sentiment and positioning. Right now, Bitcoin ETFs play a crucial role in capital flows within the crypto market, and their behavior indicates that investors are already on edge. Since Trump’s election, Bitcoin ETFs have seen record-breaking inflows, with $2 billion pouring in within just 48 hours. But that momentum has shifted. Outflows have dominated for eight consecutive trading days as of Feb. 27, totaling $3 billion, including a single-day record withdrawal of $1 billion on Feb. 25—the highest ever. This pattern suggests that retail traders, who make up a significant portion of the market, are moving in herds, exiting en masse when volatility spikes. The danger here is that tariffs could introduce a fresh catalyst for panic. If inflation rises and the Fed signals that rate cuts will be delayed, we could see even deeper ETF outflows, creating “air pockets” in the market where Bitcoin experiences sudden and extreme price swings. At the same time, institutional investors, who have been increasing their exposure to Bitcoin through ETFs, may start to rethink their allocations. Hedge funds and asset managers entered the crypto space expecting long-term gains, but they remain sensitive to macroeconomic conditions. If the cost of capital stays high due to prolonged Fed tightening, risk-adjusted returns for Bitcoin may start looking less attractive compared to other investments. Hence, a sustained shift in institutional sentiment could accelerate Bitcoin’s decline, reinforcing a cycle of volatility. Moreover, what’s different this time is the scale of the crypto market. During the last major trade war between the U.S. and China in 2018, the total crypto market was valued at around $300 billion. Today, it’s worth over ten times that amount, with far deeper institutional involvement and exposure to global financial flows. This means any macro-driven shock—whether it’s tariffs, inflation spikes, or rate hikes—has the potential to trigger broader disruptions than ever before. Where does crypto go from here? The crypto market finds itself at a crossroads, caught between short-term panic and long-term positioning. With Bitcoin plunging 26% from its highs and the fear and greed index hitting levels last seen during the Luna collapse, sentiment is extremely bearish. Analysts are divided, but a common thread runs through their assessments: this downturn may not last much longer. Arthur Hayes, for instance, predicts another sharp drop on the horizon. He warns that the market is making lower lows and could see “one more violent wave down below $80K” before stabilizing. We are making lower lows in this current wave. I was tempted to add risk this morning, but looking at this price action I think we have one more violent wave down below $80k, most likely over the weekend, then crickets for a while. Hold on to your butts! pic.twitter.com/e6nshZejAb — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) February 28, 2025 However, he also hints at a quieter period to follow, suggesting that once this shakeout is over, the market might enter a phase of relative calm. Julien Bittel, Head of Macro Research at Global Macro Investor, takes a more structural approach. He argues that the entire market downturn, including Bitcoin’s drop, is a direct consequence of tighter financial conditions from late last year. There’s a lot of noise in the market right now – conflicting narratives everywhere. But here’s the reality – or at least my take on what’s really going on: Everything happening in markets right now, especially in crypto, is a direct consequence of the tightening of financial… pic.twitter.com/iLPqiyw3LX — Julien Bittel, CFA (@BittelJulien) February 28, 2025 Yet, Bittel sees this cycle already reversing. “Financial conditions have been easing rapidly over the past two months,” he points out, citing falling bond yields, a weaker dollar, and lower oil prices as early signs that the tide is turning. With Bitcoin now at an RSI of 23—the most oversold level since August 2023—Bittel suggests that those still leaning bearish “shouldn’t get too comfortable.” Technical analysts are also spotting potential inflection points. Edward Morra notes that Bitcoin is nearing the completion of a key CME breakout gap from last year. $BTC We almost filled the CME breakout gap from last year. I know market looks absolutely rekt but thats actually good news, we now have a gap to fill higher (~$93k), so I think the bounce is pretty close. Remember, gaps are not 100% hit rate but v high (9/10 gaps fill). pic.twitter.com/qBdM7iGxJN — Edward Morra (@edwardmorra_btc) February 28, 2025 While the market “looks absolutely wrecked,” he argues that this is actually setting up for a strong bounce. According to Morra’s data, nearly 90% of these gaps eventually get filled, which would suggest a move back toward the $93,000 range. Meanwhile, Michaël van de Poppe focuses on sentiment, pointing out that fear has reached extreme levels at a time when the U.S. government is more pro-crypto than ever. #Bitcoin is down 25%. The #Crypto fear & greed index hits 10. The fear & greed index is as low as during the Luna collapse. The government in the U.S. is massively pro-crypto. I would say that this is going to reverse quickly in the next 1-2 weeks and the bottom is close. — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) February 27, 2025 “I would say this is going to reverse quickly,” he predicts, estimating that the bottom is likely just “one to two weeks away.” While the market may be oversold, that doesn’t mean it can’t go lower. Though some signs point to a potential bounce, the broader picture remains uncertain. If liquidity continues to improve and inflation stays under control, a recovery could be on the horizon. However, if macro conditions worsen, this could be just another stop on the way down. For now, traders should remain cautious. Fear may be a contrarian signal, but blindly assuming a reversal could be just as risky. The golden rule remains: trade wisely and never invest more than you can afford to lose.",Markets|Feature|Bear Market|Donald Trump|Inflation|United States,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-02-28 15:47:03

Many people think this coin, which is currently only $0.015, has the potential to rise sharply after debut. Mutuum Finance provides genuine utility by allowing users to lend, borrow, and generate passive income, in contrast to speculative investments. It is a desirable investment for anyone seeking long-term growth because of its organized financial mechanism, which guarantees steady demand. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance’s decentralized lending system, which enables users to lend money or earn interest without having to sell their shares, is a major feature that attracts attention to the company. By guaranteeing that consumers can access liquidity while retaining asset ownership, this strategy offers financial freedom. MUTM is a good choice for investors seeking stability and high returns because its demand is based on actual financial activity rather than on hype-driven pumps. Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) are the two lending options that Mutuum Finance provides. Users of the P2C model can contribute assets to liquidity pools, from which borrowers can obtain loans in response to market demand. To keep things balanced and guarantee that lenders receive consistent returns, interest rates are dynamically adjusted. Meanwhile, the P2P model allows users to directly negotiate loan terms, making it easier to borrow assets that may not be widely available in liquidity pools. This flexibility makes the platform attractive to a broad range of investors. Example of Lending: A user supplies 10,000 USDT into the liquidity pool and earns interest based on market demand. If the APY is 8%, the lender would receive 800 USDT per year in passive income. Example of Borrowing: Another user, needing funds but not wanting to sell ETH, deposits ETH as collateral and borrows 5,000 USDT. As long as the loan is overcollateralized, the borrower makes interest payments based on the platform’s annual percentage yield (APY) model without following a set payback plan. In an effort to fortify its ecosystem, Mutuum Finance is creating an overcollateralized stablecoin, which will be burnt upon loan repayment or liquidation and created when customers submit collateral. This stablecoin will function as a trustworthy lending instrument, offering a substitute for conventional stablecoins while maintaining decentralization and transparency. Mutuum’s stablecoin will be backed by on-chain assets, lowering counterparty risk in contrast to centralized stablecoins that depend on third-party reserves. The protocol’s treasury will receive all interest earned from stablecoin loans, boosting sustainability and bolstering liquidity. One of the most promising aspects of Mutuum Finance is its buy-and-distribute mechanism, designed to support price stability and long-term demand. A portion of platform fees will be allocated to buying back MUTM tokens, which are then distributed to mtToken stakers. This process ensures constant buy pressure on the market, rewarding long-term holders and helping maintain token value over time. Mutuum Finance’s presale has seen rapid success, with over 1.54 million MUTM tokens sold and more than 3,050 holders onboard in just 18 days. This level of fundraising momentum positions MUTM as one of the fastest-growing presale projects of 2025. The team is also preparing to launch a beta version of the platform by the time the token hits exchanges, ensuring strong demand from day one. Unlike many presale tokens that launch without a working product, MUTM’s lending platform, stablecoin integration, and continuous buybacks create real utility and long-term value. With these fundamentals in place, analysts see a $5 price target as not just speculation but a realistic milestone as adoption grows. As Solana (SOL) faces volatility, many of its investors are turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for a more stable, utility-driven opportunity. With real financial use cases, passive income potential, and structured tokenomics, MUTM is emerging as a strong alternative. Its growing adoption and built-in demand mechanisms make it a promising altcoin for long-term growth.

In a Friday X post , the Ethereum Foundation has launched the Silviculture Society, a collective of external blockchain experts tasked with providing informal advice to the organization. The initiative aims to ensure Ethereum remains committed to principles such as open-source development, privacy, security, and resistance to censorship. Blockchain expert developers join EF through the Silviculture society The advisory group includes well-known figures from across the blockchain space and crypto community. Among them are Synthetix contributor going by the X handle @llamaonthebrink, Web3 security researcher @alpeh_v, Golem Foundation co-founder Julian Zawistowski, and Sigil NFT developer @Enoch. In total, 15 individuals have been appointed to the society. “ Ethereum’s success depends on having talented and committed developers building with these values in mind, and EF’s ethos and work has always been centered around them ,” the Ethereum Foundation said. Developers included in the list were generally “excited” about their roles on the foundation. “ Happy to be involved in this initiative with several people I have worked with before and others I know by reputation ,” said one member. gm Silviculture Society 🥰 https://t.co/vu8z5ONxST — mrs kzg.eth (@kassandraETH) February 28, 2025 A particularly more headlined inclusion is Kassandra, co-founder and CTO of Arrakis Finance, an Ethereum Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) market. Arrakis Finance publicly congratulated Kassandra, stating, “ This collective will advise the Ethereum Foundation to ensure it upholds Ethereum’s core values of open source, privacy, security, and censorship resistance. We look forward to watching the infinite garden flourish in 2025 and beyond .” EF donates $1.25M to Tornado Cash developer’s legal defense The Ethereum Foundation announced a $1.25 million donation to support the legal defense of Alexey Pertsev, a developer behind Tornado Cash. The US Treasury sanctioned the Ethereum-based privacy tool in 2022, alleging that it facilitated illicit transactions, including those tied to North Korean hackers. On Wednesday, EF doubled down on its stance on software development as a “fundamental right”, stating on X, “Writing code is not a crime.” The organization also provided a link for others who wished to contribute to Pertsev’s legal fund. The EF is donating $1.25M to the legal defense of Alexey Pertsev. Privacy is normal, and writing code is not a crime. You can contribute to @alex_pertsev 's defense here: https://t.co/shWFNoDJ9g https://t.co/ITvEiRkAGt — Ethereum Foundation (@ethereumfndn) February 26, 2025 Tornado Cash is a crypto mixing service designed to allow users to send and receive Ethereum anonymously. Yet, US authorities claim the tool was used to launder stolen funds from cryptocurrency hacks. The case has gotten the interest of privacy advocates, including some US lawmakers, who propounded that sanctioning the software amounts to an attack on digital privacy and civil liberties. Aya Miyaguchi transitions to EF president In other news, EF’s executive director, Aya Miyaguchi, announced she is stepping down from her current role and will assume a newly created position as president of the foundation. The leadership transition was outlined in a blog post published on Tuesday. Miyaguchi stated that her new role would focus on expanding EF’s institutional relationships and furthering its long-term vision. She framed Ethereum’s development through the lens of Stewart Brand’s pace-layering model, talking more about the network’s need to function across multiple layers while maintaining decentralization. “ The value of credible neutrality doesn’t mean treating everything equally; it means making principled choices that protect Ethereum’s integrity at its core, ” she said. She also reaffirmed the foundation’s commitment to what she called the “philosophy of subtraction,” a strategy aimed at preventing centralization by empowering independent teams rather than consolidating control within EF.

As the CEO of BlockTechGroup, Alessio has been at the forefront of blockchain development, focusing not just on financial applications but also on how this transformative technology can reshape other industries. In this article, Alessio shares his thoughts on blockchain’s potential to go beyond crypto, highlighting specific use cases and sectors where he envisions significant impact. Shaping the Future: Blockchain as a Cross-Industry Game Changer “Blockchain’s true power lies in its versatility,” Alessio begins. For him, the next wave of blockchain is about expanding its utility beyond finance, tapping into its potential as a foundational technology for various sectors. Blockchain's core attributes—security, transparency, and decentralization—make it a game-changer in more than just digital currency. According to Alessio, these features can drive transformation across many industries, offering new solutions to old problems. “Blockchain is more than a buzzword; it’s a tool for change,” he says. His goal is to explore the ways blockchain can streamline processes, enhance trust, and create new opportunities in areas that are often overlooked in mainstream discussions. Real-World Applications: Blockchain in Supply Chain Management One of the most promising areas Alessio highlights is supply chain management. “In a global economy, the ability to verify and track every stage of a product’s journey is crucial,” he explains. Blockchain technology can provide real-time transparency in the supply chain, reducing fraud, ensuring authenticity, and simplifying logistics. From verifying the origin of raw materials to monitoring the handling of goods, blockchain can increase efficiency and accountability across the board. For instance, a blockchain-powered supply chain can help manufacturers and consumers alike trace the history of a product, ensuring its ethical sourcing and quality standards. “This kind of transparency empowers everyone involved,” Alessio notes. Healthcare: A New Era of Data Security and Patient Empowerment In the healthcare sector, blockchain’s potential is vast. Alessio points to data security and patient empowerment as two key areas where blockchain can make a difference. “Healthcare is about trust, and blockchain can enhance that trust by safeguarding sensitive information,” he says. With blockchain, medical records can be securely stored and accessed only by authorized individuals, reducing the risks of data breaches and unauthorized sharing. Blockchain can also empower patients to take control of their own health data, allowing them to grant permissions for sharing records with healthcare providers, insurers, or specialists as needed. “It’s about putting power back in the hands of individuals,” Alessio adds, emphasizing that blockchain can lead to more personalized and secure healthcare experiences. Blockchain’s Role in Intellectual Property and Digital Rights Another sector where Alessio sees blockchain’s impact growing is intellectual property (IP) management. “Creators deserve recognition and fair compensation for their work,” he says. Blockchain’s ability to create immutable digital records makes it an ideal solution for tracking the ownership and distribution of digital content, from art and music to patents and trademarks. By using blockchain, creators can register their work, track its usage, and manage licensing agreements in a transparent way. This reduces disputes and ensures that royalties reach the right recipients. “It’s about safeguarding creativity,” Alessio explains, “and ensuring that innovation is rewarded fairly.” Governance and Public Services: A Transparent Future Alessio is also excited about blockchain’s potential in governance and public services. “Transparency is key to good governance,” he notes, and blockchain can provide a decentralized way to manage records, voting systems, and public data. Imagine a voting system where every vote is securely recorded and publicly verifiable, or a land registry that’s tamper-proof and easily accessible to all stakeholders. These applications not only build trust but also reduce administrative burdens and lower costs. “Blockchain can make governments more efficient and accountable,” Alessio states, suggesting that this technology could play a vital role in fostering a more open and transparent society. Looking Ahead: The Endless Possibilities of Blockchain For Alessio, blockchain’s future is about breaking down silos and creating seamless connections across industries. “We’re just scratching the surface of what’s possible,” he says. As technology evolves, he envisions blockchain becoming more user-friendly and widely adopted, paving the way for innovative solutions that go far beyond cryptocurrency. Whether it’s improving education, securing energy grids, or reshaping social networks, blockchain has the potential to leave a lasting impact. His optimism for the future of blockchain doesn’t come with concrete predictions but rather an open-ended invitation to explore what’s possible. “Blockchain’s strength lies in its adaptability,” he concludes. “The more we experiment and collaborate, the more we’ll discover what it can truly achieve.” Conclusion Alessio Vinassa’s insights on the future of blockchain go beyond the typical financial applications and explore the technology’s broader potential. From supply chains to healthcare, digital rights to governance, blockchain stands as a versatile tool with the power to drive change across industries. Alessio’s belief in blockchain’s transformative capabilities is a call for open-minded exploration, highlighting the importance of shared efforts and innovative thinking as we move into the next phase of technological evolution.

THORChain ( RUNE ) was trading at $1.3050 on Friday, down 82% from its November peak. It is hovering near its lowest level since November 2023 and remains 90% below its all-time high. RUNE has plunged despite third-party data showing that the network recently recorded one of its best weeks ever. Swap volume on the platform surged 640% over the past seven days to $3.3 billion, making it the sixth-largest player in the decentralized exchange industry. Additional data from TokenTerminal shows that weekly active addresses nearly quintupled to 5,000, up from this month’s low of 1,000. However, this surge in activity has been linked to the recent Bybit hack . According to Arkham, Lazarus Group transferred over $240 million worth of Ethereum through the network. The group laundered the stolen Ethereum ( ETH ) by converting it to Bitcoin ( BTC ). ALERT: LAZARUS LAUNDERING THROUGH THORCHAIN – MINIMUM $240M SO FAR Over $240M of ETH has been sent through Thorchain by Lazarus-tagged wallets on Arkham. These funds have mainly been swapped for native BTC. pic.twitter.com/C1EYtj6aFw — Arkham (@arkham) February 27, 2025 The spike in volume comes as THORChain grapples with major challenges. In January, the company paused Ethereum and Bitcoin lending after its liabilities exceeded $200 million. On Friday, Pluto, a core developer in the network, announced his resignation after a vote to block North Korean hacker-linked transactions failed. These transactions could trigger an investigation by U.S. authorities, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Earlier this week, the FBI confirmed that Lazarus Group was behind the Bybit hack.

Currently in the second phase at $0.015, the presale has attracted more than 3200 holders. Mutuum Finance will progress across 11 presale stages before launching at $0.06. This means a 4x ROI for investors buying in phase 2. A 19344% post-launch rally, would skyrocket the token to $8. While Pepe Coin (PEPE) and Solana (SOL) struggle to maintain momentum, Mutuum Finance’s blend of decentralized lending utilities and strategic tokenomics is capturing attention for its realistic growth trajectory. Mutuum Finance presale gains momentum Investors are gravitating toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as its presale accelerates through Phase 2. Over $1.7 million has been raised since the initiative began, reflecting robust demand for a project anchored in decentralized finance solutions. The platform’s peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer lending models allow users to earn passive income or access liquidity without selling assets, addressing a critical gap in the DeFi sector. With 3,200 holders already onboard, the presale’s rapid progress underscores confidence in MUTM’s roadmap, including an upcoming overcollateralized stablecoin designed to enhance borrowing efficiency. The current price of $0.015 represents the lowest available entry point before incremental increases lead to a $0.06 listing. Early participants are locking in positions ahead of the next phase, where prices rise to $0.02. This structure ensures immediate gains for those buying now, while the post-launch target of $8, based on platform adoption and token scarcity, positions MUTM as a high-reward opportunity. Strategic tokenomics drive growth potential Mutuum Finance (MUTM) distinguishes itself through a buy-and-distribute mechanism that fuels sustained demand. A portion of platform fees will automatically purchase MUTM from the market, redistributing tokens to stakers and creating consistent upward pressure on prices. This model, combined with a capped supply, minimizes volatility and incentivizes long-term holding. The upcoming stablecoin launch further amplifies utility, linking MUTM’s value to real-world DeFi activity as borrowing demand rises. The project’s transparency adds to its appeal. Smart contracts audited by third-party firms ensure secure transactions, while a $100,000 giveaway campaign boosts community engagement. With Phase 2 underway, the window for securing tokens at $0.015 is narrowing. Delays risk missing not only the 300% gain at launch but also the exponential growth projected as the ecosystem matures. Building a robust DeFi ecosystem Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not merely speculating on future trends; it’s actively constructing infrastructure. The beta platform, set to debut alongside its exchange listing, will showcase a functional lending protocol, allowing users to test features before full deployment. This approach contrasts sharply with meme-driven tokens like Pepe Coin (PEPE), which lack tangible use cases, and established platforms like Solana (SOL), which face scalability challenges. MUTM is positioning itself as a practical alternative for novice and experienced DeFi participants by focusing on user-friendly design and asset flexibility. The project’s roadmap includes expanding supported assets and integrating cross-chain compatibility, ensuring relevance as the crypto market evolves. Early adopters are not just investing in a token, but in an ecosystem poised to capitalize on the $1.3 trillion DeFi sector. With experts highlighting the 19,344% growth potential, MUTM’s combination of innovation and accessibility makes it a standout candidate for March 2025’s top investment. As Mutuum Finance (MUTM) advances through its presale stages, the urgency to participate intensifies. Phase 2 offers the final opportunity to buy below $0.02, with the next price hike imminent. For investors seeking assets grounded in utility rather than hype, MUTM presents a calculated entry into high-yield DeFi. The project’s momentum, coupled with its aggressive post-launch targets, suggests this window for maximal gains won’t stay open long.

The crypto sell-off that started last week amid the Bybit hack has caused panic among investors as reflected by the Fear & Greed Index. According to data from CoinMarketCap, this market sentiment gauge has dropped to its lowest level since the website started to compile it back in June 2023. At its current level of 21, it indicates that the market is in “Extreme Fear” mode, as a result of the latest downturn. XRP Price Analysis as XRP Bounces Off Key Support Area According to CoinGlass, $22.3 million XRP long positions were liquidated in the past 24 hours while $415.5 million worth of BTC longs were flushed out of the system as well. Trading volumes for XRP have surged by 11.3% in the past day as well and currently stand at $7.65 billion, accounting for 6.5% of the token’s market cap. This latest weakness has pushed the yearly performance of XRP to negative territory as the token has now shed 1.7% of its value since 2025 started. Comparatively, XRP is still the best-performing crypto asset of the top 5 as Bitcoin (BTC) has dropped by 13.9% and Ethereum (ETH) has shed 36% of its value in 2025. Selling pressure in the past 7 days has been significant to cryptocurrencies. During this period, XRP has dropped by 23.3%. This decline is pushing the asset to a critical area of support that bulls have thus far defended to avoid an even more pronounced decline. XRP has established strong support between $2.03 and $1.78, historically acting as a rebound zone during market downturns. While the price briefly bounced off $2.03 yesterday, ongoing bearish sentiment suggests a potential retest of the lower boundary, signaling a 13% downside risk in the short term. Momentum indicators remain unfavorable, with the RSI deep in oversold territory and the MACD histogram reflecting increasing negative momentum. If XRP drops below $1.78, a further decline toward $1.29—a 27.5% correction—becomes likely. However, a rebound from this level could see the price rally toward $2.80 in the coming weeks. For investors seeking a more balanced approach, Meme Index ($MEMEX) offers exposure to a diversified basket of meme coins, providing a decentralized alternative to investing in individual tokens. Meme Index Raises $3.8M to Launch its Meme Coin Index Platform Meme Index ($MEMEX) has disrupted the market, offering a groundbreaking way to gain exposure to the meme coin sector through its four diversified indexes.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/binance-founder-cz-evaluated-the-market-drop-warned-investors-here-are-the-details/,"Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao addressed the latest crypto market correction by emphasizing that price pullbacks are a natural part of free markets. Binance Founder CZ Speaks on Market Correction: “A Natural Part of Free Markets” In a social media post, CZ wrote: “Corrections are part of free markets. This is not financial advice. If you feel pressured, you may need to reduce your investment size (if you view crypto as an investment). For me, it was a change in worldview. I left the old world 11 years ago.” CZ's comments come amid a sharp decline in cryptocurrency prices, with Bitcoin and other major digital assets experiencing significant pullbacks. CZ’s comments suggest that investors should evaluate their risk tolerance and adjust their positions accordingly, rather than react emotionally to market fluctuations. A long-time advocate of decentralization and financial freedom, CZ has often spoken about his move away from traditional finance. His latest statements reinforce his long-term belief in crypto, seeing it as more than just an asset class but a fundamental shift in global financial systems. Despite the market volatility, CZ’s message reflects confidence in the long-term trajectory of digital assets and reminds investors to approach the market with a measured perspective. *This is not investment advice.

In a statement this week, the division stated that it does not view meme coins as securities but more like collectibles. Meme Coins Are Not Securities According to the SEC’s latest guidance , transactions involving meme coins do not constitute the offer and sale of securities under the Securities Act of 1933. As a result, those offering or selling meme coins are not required to register their transactions with the SEC or seek exemptions from registration. This means that federal securities law protections do not apply to meme coin purchasers or holders. The division’s position is based on the definition of securities under federal law, which includes financial instruments like stocks, bonds, and investment contracts. It said that meme coins do not fit these categories, as they do not yield profits, convey income rights, or involve “pooled investments” managed by third parties. The statement also highlighted that meme coin purchases are speculative, with value driven by market demand rather than managerial efforts by promoters. However, the SEC clarified that fraudulent activities related to meme coins could still face enforcement actions under other federal or state laws. This guidance, however, does not apply to products misrepresented as meme coins to circumvent securities regulations. Each case will be evaluated based on the specific economic realities of the transaction, as per the division. SEC’s Revised Approach The SEC’s updated guidance on meme coins comes about a month into President Donald Trump’s second term. Just before his inauguration, Trump introduced a meme coin named Official Trump (TRUMP) for his supporters, while his wife, Melania Trump, launched a separate token called Official Melania (MELANIA). The new SEC chairman, Mark Uyeda, appointed by Trump in January, had previously indicated plans to clarify cryptocurrency regulations. On his first day in office, Uyeda announced the creation of a cryptocurrency task force. The SEC now states that meme coins do not qualify as securities in a notable shift from the agency’s approach under former chairman Gary Gensler, who pushed for crypto tokens to be categorized as securities and urged crypto service providers to register with it. Earlier this month, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce had said that many of the meme coins in the market do not come under the regulatory scope of the regulatory agency while asserting that “facts and circumstances matter.” The post Meme Coins Do Not Qualify as Securities: SEC Confirms appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Donald Trump|Meme coins|SEC,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-02-28 15:58:54

While both Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) have collapsed to lows not seen since Donald Trump’s re-election, XRP remains 325% above its November 1 prices despite falling to $2.16. XRP one-week price chart. Source: Finbold Such relative calm can, most likely, be attributed to an external factor that has been bearing heavily on the token’s performance across multiple years: the legal battle between the SEC and Ripple Labs. Is the SEC pivotal for XRP’s next move? This week, the Commission sent a veritable deluge of notices to numerous cryptocurrency companies indicating it is either dropping the existing charges against them or not moving forward with enforcement following lengthy probes. While major firms and platforms like Coinbase and OpenSea have been graced with such decisions, Ripple has been notable for its absence. Indeed, many analysts and traders were expecting a rather swift resolution to the courtroom saga following Gary Gensler’s departure from the agency , as evidenced by the 539.62% rally between November 1 and January 17. Likewise, the fact that investors are still waiting helped drive XRP’s decline in the aftermath of Donald Trump’s January 20 inauguration. At press time on February 28, it appears highly likely that the market is holding off on major buying or selling activity as many estimate the SEC’s decision may be imminent. The anticipation is also evident in the rumor that Trump’s Crypto Task Force met with lawyers this week, allegedly to discuss dropping the case against Ripple. Still, the rumor is likely false given the somewhat cryptic ‘no’ reply on a widely circulated X post claiming the meeting took place left by Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terret. Terret, who has been tracking the cryptocurrency industry closely for years, did, on the other hand, claim that U.S. regulators are moving quickly toward providing legal clarity to the industry by ‘defining security status.’ 🚨SCOOP: The @SECGov Crypto Task Force is getting ready to hold a series of roundtables with industry participants entitled “Spring Sprint Towards Crypto Clarity,” two people familiar with the matter tell me. The first of the five planned roundtables will be held on March 21 at… — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) February 28, 2025 Why XRP traders might soon have to move with or without SEC XPR, for its part, may make a major move as soon as March 1 with or without an SEC decision, given the planned 1 billion token unlocking scheduled for the day . Beyond the immediate volatility and regulatory anticipation, technical analysis ( TA ) indicates that XRP could move lower, possibly toward $1.60 , in the near future, though there remained a case for a rally to $3 and beyond as recently as February 27, as Finbold reported on the day.

The altcoin struggles to remain over the support of $2.25 at the price of $2.23 on 35% declines on daily volumes. Analysts anticipate an imminent drop of 13.5% to $1.90 in case of a continuation of selling. As long-term investors purchase XRP, attested by $187 million of exchange outflows, short-term speculators are unloading riskier wagers. Meanwhile, decentralized lending protocol Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ignores the blue funk, recording over 3,400 investors and raking in $1.8 million in the ongoing presale. Phase two is live at $0.015 per token as MUTM’s tokenomics roadmap forecasts a 400% peak on exchange listing. Furthermore, rumors of a 4,950% rally after launch have early adopters thrilled. XRP’s Market Position XRP is becoming more skeptical with open interest in disarray, indicating loss of confidence on the part of derivatives traders. The reality that the token was unable to sustain prices above $2.25 raised alarm, as technical charts showed a breakdown to $1.90. In spite of positive macro events such as pro-cryptocurrency American politics and several XRP ETF filings, the altcoin remains held back by bearish sentiment. Short-term speculators drive the action, closing trades on volatile moves, and institutions take advantage of the dip for strategic buying. More than $187 million in XRP left exchanges last week, and that is stealthy bullish positioning. As long as the sentiment doesn’t change, XRP can duplicate 2023’s fall, where constant sell-offs destroyed half of its worth in weeks. The token’s 0.85% one-day decline keeps pace with overall pressure in crypto markets, as Bitcoin and Ethereum also see declines. XRP must remain above more than $2.50, a level hit in January 2025, before bouncing back to $3.30. While XRP is lagging behind, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is hemorrhaging investor attention, raising $1.8 million in presale capital. Phase two of the project is offering tokens for $0.015, 33.3% cheaper than phase three at $0.02. Early birds earn 400% returns when MUTM comes out to market for $0.06, but post-listing projections are astronomical: conservative estimates place $7.50 per token, a 49,900% return on investment for phase two investors. Sustained Demand By Buy Pressure Mutuum Finance (MUTM) successfully fulfills token demand by a buy-and-distribute mechanism. The company fees for some of its auto MUTM purchases, onboarding them as mtToken stakers. The system creates enduring buy pressure that nullifies post-listing sell-outs. Piled on top of a $100,000 presale giveaway, gifting 10 investors $10,000 each, the strategy puts investor pressure on the token. Interestingly, more than 3,400 holders have already subscribed in anticipation of scaling the protocol into peer-to-peer lending. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is progressing through presale phases very rapidly, and phase two tokens are available for sale at all-time lowest price ever. Tokenomics for the project reserved 20% supply for liquidity mining in a bid to give clean exchange trading when going live. Early investors not only realize instant paper profit but also position themselves for exponential growth when Mutuum adds overcollateralized stablecoins and extends an olive branch to involve auditors to ensure smart contracts. XRP is lagging behind, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has an escape from significant price volatility. Its lending system and low supply anchor it. We have the same type of situation that we had in 2014 when Ethereum originally priced token at $0.31 now rests over $2,300. The focus is now on profitable ventures. XRP is forward-looking based on further market trends. However, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) possesses an auto-sustaining stable demand. As phase two is shortly going to get over, purchasing at less than $0.02 is shortly going to get out of the way. Investors sidestepping XRP volatility are considering MUTM stable growth. This is probably going to reverse investment trends in 2025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is on the presale trend. New DeFi concepts here have ways to earn money. If XRP is around $2.10 and MUTM is around $0.015, earning money is 400% guaranteed. After listing, aspirations are over 4,900%. Having good buying power and actual lending makes it immune to drastic changes affecting other projects. Buy now before phase three dominates.

To read full editions, subscribe . Need some reassurance after watching bitcoin fall under $80,000 last night? We managed to climb back above that level this morning, but only slightly — at least at the time I was writing this. I hope I didn’t jinx it. ETH, on the other hand, is holding on to $2,100. On the Empire roundup this week, co-host Jason Yanowitz explained his thoughts on the current market . For him, there are only three options: The start of the bear, the end of the four-year cycle or a simple pullback. If you voted for pullback, then you’re right on the money. “ I feel very convicted that this is not a bear market. So let me just [go] on the record, this is not a bear market,” he said, giving it a 20-30% chance that this marks the end of the four-year cycle and roughly an 80% chance that this is merely a bull market pullback. Yanowitz gave 2021 as an example, citing the 56% pullback that bitcoin experienced a few years ago. “ ETH drew down 61%, SOL drew down 67%. And a lot of other things, in the middle of the year — in the middle of what we look back and think [of as the] 2021 peak bull market — drew down like 70 to 80%. I just think people are very quick to forget that,” he said. If Yanowitz is right — and my reporting this week is in favor of what he’s said — then the harsh truth is that pullbacks are tough and anxiety inducing, but they’re not forever. I know it’s an utter cliche at this point, but the Brits really nailed this one: Keep calm and carry on. And now you know. New Staff Statement from the SEC on memecoins just landed (link in thread). Two observations: 1. It's refreshing to see the SEC adopt a constrained view of its own power. 2. Fraud is, always has been, and always must be illegal. pic.twitter.com/Rw7agzjcxa — Katie Biber (@katiebiber) February 27, 2025 A dose of clarity was handed over to the market last night in the form of an SEC statement on memecoins. I think, after spending some time on it, that I’d characterize this as a bit of a mixed bag, though I’m leaning towards optimism. Let’s start with the good: The SEC actually put the Howey test to work without a lawsuit! Huge. Love this for them. It’s exactly what the industry has wanted to see — and no one had to file a lawsuit or a FOIA for this clarity. The SEC’s determination on memecoins based on the Howey test If the collectible language sounds familiar, it’s because crypto czar David Sacks seems to have paved the way for this statement by saying, back in late January, that memecoins resembled something more akin to collectibles than securities. SEC commissioner and head of the new crypto task force, Hester Peirce, also said that memecoins don’t fall under the SEC’s jurisdiction in an interview earlier this month. Why is the SEC’s new stance a mixed bag? Because it now seems more likely that the industry will have to self-regulate, meaning that it’s still open season for memecoins. The SEC isn’t totally washing its hands of them, noting that any “fraudulent conduct” in relation to the sale or the offer of memecoins is still subject to enforcement actions and prosecution by federal agencies. But this statement did come at the perfect time: We’re starting to see memecoins slow down naturally, which could point to a focusing of market momentum elsewhere, potentially leaving memecoin hype behind. My insight is that I think it’s okay to let them operate in their own bubble. We don’t want memecoins taking up so much space, but — bear with me here — I’m not sure I totally see them as something akin to baseball cards. However, I definitely think they’re like slot machines or something more along the lines of a crappy penny stock with no fundamentals. If people want to put their money there, then let them. The trick is to ensure that folks are well aware of the risks. Now we only have to hope for a flight to higher quality tokens backed by fundamentals, and bam, we’re cooking again.

Over the past 24 hours, it dropped another 3%, currently standing at $2.88 trillion. At the time of writing, the daily crypto trading volume is $215 billion. About a dozen of the top 100 coins per market cap are green today. The biggest gainer is Berachain (BERA) , having appreciated 7% to $8. The biggest drop is Uniswap (UNI)’s 7.4% to the price of $7.47. As for the top 10 coins, only one saw its price increased today, the same coin as yesterday’s highest gainer. Solana (SOL) is up 5% to $145. On the other hand, the drops range between 2.1% recorded by Bitcoin (BTC) and 5.4% seen by Cardano (ADA) . BTC currently trades at $83,949 and ADA at $0.6314. At the same time, Ethereum (ETH) decreased by 4.6%, currently changing hands at $2,217. CEX.IO Reveals Largest DDoS Attack in Its 11-Year History Crypto exchange CEX.IO said that it successfully fended off the largest DDoS attack in its 11-year history, warning other companies to stay vigilant. Per the announcement shared with Cryptonews , the attack occurred on 23 January. It lasted for 20 hours, seeing “an unprecedented” 7.7 billion Remote Procedure Call (RPC) requests. Its highest point was 28 million RPC per minute. Source: CEX.IO The team said that the attacker employed “a straightforward yet resource-intensive tactic.” They systematically targeted CEX.IO platform pages, one after another, searching for vulnerabilities. Notably, they were adapting to the security team’s countermeasures. However, CEX.IO defended itself, the team said. All services remained operational, and the attack did not cause any effect on the CEX.IO ecosystem. Alexandr Kerya, VP of Product Management at CEX.IO, said that the attacker asked for a $300,000 ransom to stop the attack but “walked away empty-handed.” He commented that the attacker’s audacity and persistence “highlighted their malicious intent.” The team warned that “considering the history of similar attacks in the industry, this one can be regarded as substantial and capable of placing an extremely high load on most blockchain networks and platforms, even those with robust infrastructure.” You might also like CEX.io Partners with MoneyGram and Stellar to Enhance Crypto Cash-In and Cash-Out Services Maple Finance Unveils Instant Withdrawals for SyrupUSDC via Uniswap Liquidity Pool DeFi institutional lender Maple Finance has introduced instant withdrawals for SyrupUSDC through a Uniswap liquidity pool (LP). It aims to redefine DeFi liquidity and eliminate “the long-standing trade-off” between high yield, fast liquidity, and security, the team said in a press release. The pool has launched with an initial $10 million in total value locked (TVL). It will represent 12% of the total SyrupUSDC supply available for instant withdrawal. Users can instantly swap SyrupUSDC for USDC in a deep liquidity pool on Uniswap and Balancer , “ensuring fast and seamless redemptions without compromising the protocol’s overcollateralization,” said the announcement. It added that SyrupUSDC remains fully overcollateralized. SyrupUSDC Instant Liquidity is Here Users no longer need to choose between high yield and fast liquidity. SyrupUSDC now has two deep liquidity pools on @Uniswap and @Balancer with $10M in TVL allowing users to swap into $USDC instantly. Details below pic.twitter.com/xKEWlRSNsv — Maple (@maplefinance) February 27, 2025 Furthermore, there are no minimum or maximum deposit restrictions, thus providing flexibility for all users. The launch also features a split of liquidity. A Balancer pool and a Uniswap pool each start with $5 million TVL. There are also plans to scale liquidity over time. Meanwhile, LPs benefit from Uniswap trading fees and additional Syrup incentives to maximize yield. Additionally, SyrupUSDC is being integrated into Morpho Vaults to enable users to borrow against their holdings. The team also plans integrations with Contango and Gearbox . “This launch marks a major milestone in Maple Finance’s broader DeFi expansion strategy, making SyrupUSDC a more versatile and liquid asset across decentralized markets,” the team said.

The two announced that SWEAT’s first implementation of the personal AI Agent integration will take place in the Sweat Wallet mobile app, seeing a deployment of millions of AI-powered personal agents. These AI-powered assistants will guide users through every stage in Movement Economy, including onboarding, staking, trading, and token management. This move makes crypto and movement incentives more intelligent, automated, and accessible, the team said. Additionally, the AI agent was trained using over 700,000 queries and questions asked by SWEAT token holders. The announcement noted that there are over 19 million SWEAT token holders and 3 million monthly active users (MAU) on Sweat Wallet. Millions of Personal AI-Agents are coming to $SWEAT . Meet Mia. https://t.co/SPbLNWSN1V — Sweat Еconomy (@SweatEconomy) February 27, 2025 Meanwhile, the announcement argues that, unlike AI-powered chatbots, SWEAT’s AI Agents directly connect to NEAR’s blockchain to offer on-chain, personalized AI assistance. The in-app AI Agents are continuously updated and evolving, and they will adapt to individual behaviors and preferences. This leads to better Web3 user experience and lower barriers to consumer crypto adoption, as well as improved engagement and retention by providing AI-driven movement incentives. Moreover, the team will gradually roll out a plug-in in the Sweat Wallet with four new modules: Health, News, Token Trends, and Security.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Ethereum whales are fueling a rally in a $0.042 AI cryptocurrency, sparking speculation on its presale momentum and future value. Table of Contents Ethereum whales and their market influence How the AI coin’s presale model is driving momentum How BeerBear’s growth model compares Investor considerations and market outlook Conclusion Ethereum (ETH) whales have long been known to influence market trends, with their large transactions often signaling shifts in sentiment and price action. Recently, whale activity has intensified around an emerging AI-based cryptocurrency, driving speculation about its presale momentum. As this $0.042 AI coin garners increasing attention, investors are closely examining how Ethereum whale movements are fueling its rally and what this could mean for its future valuation. You might also like: SOL, ETH, BeerBear: Trending altcoins positioned for significant gains Ethereum whales and their market influence Whales, or large-scale holders of ETH, play a crucial role in the crypto market by executing sizable transactions that can impact liquidity, price movements, and overall sentiment. Tracking whale movements has become an essential practice for traders looking to anticipate market trends. Over the past few weeks, on-chain data has revealed that multiple ETH whales have allocated significant funds to the presale of this AI-focused cryptocurrency, signaling confidence in its potential. One key reason behind the growing whale interest is the AI coin’s integration of artificial intelligence into blockchain applications, a sector that has seen substantial growth. With AI-driven analytics, smart contract optimization, and enhanced security measures, this project offers features that appeal to both institutional and retail investors. How the AI coin’s presale model is driving momentum The structured presale model of this AI coin has been a major contributor to its increasing traction. The token launched at $0.042, with a phased price increase planned throughout the presale stages. This incremental pricing model incentivizes early adoption while creating a sense of urgency for investors. Whale participation in the early rounds has further accelerated the presale’s visibility, attracting a wider investor base seeking exposure to AI-powered blockchain solutions. Additionally, the project’s roadmap includes AI-enhanced trading bots, predictive analytics, and data-driven governance features that provide real utility beyond speculative trading. These elements make it an attractive proposition in a market where utility-driven projects are gaining precedence over purely hype-driven assets. How BeerBear’s growth model compares While AI-focused tokens are experiencing increased demand, other emerging projects like BeerBear are also capturing investor attention with different engagement models. Unlike AI tokens, which rely on technological advancements in artificial intelligence, BeerBear integrates blockchain gaming and community-driven rewards into its ecosystem. BeerBear’s presale follows a structured pricing model similar to the AI coin, with initial prices set at $0.0004 and expected to rise to $0.0020. This transparency in token distribution allows early participants to engage at lower price points while ensuring long-term sustainability. Additionally, BeerBear’s play-to-earn mechanics and NFT rewards system provide a different form of engagement compared to AI-driven utility projects, offering diversity within the growing crypto market. Investor considerations and market outlook The rise of AI-focused cryptocurrencies highlights the increasing intersection between blockchain technology and artificial intelligence. As ETH whales continue to back the $0.042 AI coin’s presale, its potential for wider adoption remains strong. However, investors should remain mindful of market volatility and broader economic conditions that could influence short-term price fluctuations. Meanwhile, alternative projects like BeerBear showcase how diversified blockchain ecosystems can cater to different investor preferences. Whether focusing on AI-enhanced trading or play-to-earn gaming incentives, both projects present unique opportunities within the evolving crypto landscape. Watch BeerBear in Action: View the project’s gameplay and features in its official video. Watch the video Conclusion Ethereum whale activity has played a significant role in fueling the presale rally of the $0.042 AI coin, underscoring growing investor confidence in blockchain-based artificial intelligence applications. At the same time, projects like BeerBear offer alternative investment opportunities through gaming and community-driven rewards. As the market continues to evolve, investors exploring both AI-driven and gaming-focused crypto assets may find compelling opportunities in these emerging sectors.

Not the strongest. Just the one crazy enough to never quit. Enter XYZepe, the masked warrior, the relentless XYZ believer, and the fighter determined to push XYZVerse to the top of CoinMarketCap. The crowd is already in his corner — 95% of the CMC community is ultra-bullish on XYZ. But champions aren’t given titles — they earn them. XYZ has battled through 10 of 15 presale rounds, with momentum only building. The hype is real, the community is growing, and the price is primed for liftoff. The underdog with a knockout punch At just $0.0025, XYZ is a steal — but not for long. By the presale’s end, it’s projected to skyrocket to $0.1. The fight isn’t over, but the path to victory is set. Champions get paid In XYZVerse, loyalty pays off. Holders aren’t just spectators — they’re rewarded with airdropped tokens, making them part of the action. This isn’t just a game; it’s a movement where passion turns into profit. The road to victory With rock-solid tokenomics, upcoming CEX and DEX listings, and strategic token burns, XYZ isn’t just surviving — it’s dominating. Every move is designed to boost price action, fuel community growth, and cement XYZ as a future legend. Ondo Ondo (ONDO) has seen notable price movements recently. In the past week, its price fell by over 17%. This downward trend continues over the past month, with a decrease of more than 25%. However, when looking at the last six months, ONDO’s price has surged by approximately 54%, showing significant long-term growth. Based on this data, ONDO’s short-term performance appears to be bearish, but its long-term trend is bullish. The current price ranges between $1.05 and $1.25, which is close to its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages of around $1. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is near 54, indicating that the token is neither overbought nor oversold. If the price rises, ONDO could reach its nearest resistance level at $1.37, which would be an increase of about 10%. Breaking this level might lead to the second resistance at $1.57, representing a potential gain of roughly 25% from the current price. On the downside, if the price falls below the support level at $0.97, it could drop to the next support at $0.77, signifying a possible decrease of about 20%. These levels suggest that ONDO’s price could move in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Mantra Over the past six months, MANTRA (OM) has seen remarkable growth, with its price increasing by 683.79%. In the last month, the price jumped by 55.60%, indicating strong upward momentum. However, the past week showed a slight downturn of 4.47%, bringing the current price range to $7.34-$9.42. Technical indicators present a mixed picture. The Relative Strength Index is at 43.82, suggesting the asset is neither overbought nor oversold. The MACD level sits at -0.0606, which could hint at bearish momentum. The Stochastic oscillator is at 65.47, hovering in a neutral zone. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $7.31, slightly below the 100-day average of $7.88, pointing to a short-term consolidation. Looking ahead, the nearest resistance level is at $10.33. A move above this could open the path to the second resistance at $12.41, representing potential gains. On the downside, the nearest support is at $6.18, with a second support at $4.11. Breaching these levels might signal further declines. The recent price performance suggests that traders are watching these key levels closely for future direction. Conclusion ONDO and OM show promise, but XYZ stands out as the first all-sport meme coin, uniting sports fans and aiming for massive growth during the 2025 bull run.

Bitcoin began trading at less than $100 in 2013 and evolved into the market-leading cryptocurrency since that time and experts believe it will achieve a $100,000 value by December 2024. The increasing number of investors select Ozak AI as they seek another major market rise. The project currently generates over $900,000 through its running presale during its Phase 3, which offers $OZ tokens at a value of $0.003. The experts who analyzed $OZ forecast it to increase 2000% from its original value of $0.001 all the way up to $1 by 2025. The Early Turmoil Faced by Bitcoin Led it Toward Reaching the $100,000 Milestone Bitcoin needed several years to transform itself from a groundbreaking virtual currency into a worldwide investment platform. In 2010, Bitcoin traders gifted ten thousand bitcoins to obtain two pizzas, which today hold a value exceeding $1 billion. People showed hesitation toward adopting Bitcoin, and thus adoption proceeded at a slow pace. El Salvador introduced Bitcoin as an official legal tender in 2021 to achieve worldwide recognition of this digital asset. The long-term value of Bitcoin was proven when it rose above $109,000 in 2024. Bitcoin required multiple years to achieve its value increase, yet its holders had to navigate through regulatory challenges combined with market fluctuations as well as doubts before they could profit. Modern blockchain projects are attracting investors more quickly than Bitcoin did in its early years since investors seek upcoming high-potential assets. Ozak AI establishes itself as a leading blockchain project because users receive AI-enhanced blockchain-powered trading solutions as well as real-time financial accountability services. Ozak AI demonstrates faster market growth rates than Bitcoin achieved in its first years after launch. The Increasing Presale Demand for Ozak AI Brings Forth $100,000 Reward Pool Incentives The ongoing Ozak AI presale surpasses $900K in rising funding amounts. Future stages of the $OZ token will increase its value from the current $0.003 to $0.005. The upcoming listing price of $0.05 has prompted investors to acquire tokens early because they believe in significant market growth during the next few months. Existing buyers can claim their financial reward from a total $100,000 pool of funds while random selection will determine ownership for 100 participants. The early-stage pricing option, along with additional rewards, has stimulated increased buyer interest in this initiative. Ozak AI stands out from other speculative tokens because it provides actual functionality through its AI-based financial platform. The $OZ token enables buyers and institutions to use automated trading together with market analytics to access predictive modeling capabilities, which makes it a powerful asset. Ozak AI’s AI-Blockchain Integration and Market Potential Ozak AI delivers its main breakthrough through its AI-controlled blockchain platform, which aims to boost financial application choices. The platform includes various advanced components that operate as its core features. Ozak Stream Network (OSN) enables accelerated data handling, which permits AI algorithms to evaluate market conditions and speeds quicker than real time. Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN): Ensures secure AI operations without reliance on centralized servers. The Ozak Data Vault maintains financial data security through its implementation of powerful encryption standards. The system enables users to implement their own training methods for developing AI forecasting algorithms matching individual market intelligence requirements. Ozak AI successfully integrates blockchain security protocols with AI analytics solutions, which helps the platform reach institutional clients and business organizations that need data solution advances. Ozak AI will experience increased adoption speed because the rise in AI automation requirements continues to grow. Can Ozak AI Match Bitcoin’s Rally in a Shorter Time? Bitcoin initially took long periods to grow before the market secured its current rapid pace of development. Modern buyers can evaluate time-sensitive information and innovative projects to obtain quicker business recognition. Ozak AI benefits from the rapid growth of AI and blockchain, two of the fastest-growing tech industries. Security audits have been completed to provide transparency together with reliability for the first purchasers of this project. The presale period has concluded, and the $OZ token now faces a listing at $0.05, which provides expanded market access together with higher liquidity. Current adoption rates lead experts to anticipate Ozak AI might rally to $1 before 2025 for early investors to achieve a 2000% yield. As a next-generation crypto project, Ozak AI establishes its position through its AI-powered financial tools together with decentralized security combined with the high market demand. Investors who did not get access to Bitcoin in its initial phases view Ozak AI as the leading cryptocurrency to invest in during the emerging digital assets field.

These models suggest portfolios and rebalances which are then followed by advisors and platforms who can also request adjustments to the models based on their investment needs. BlackRock added a 1% to 2% allocation to IBIT in its target allocation portfolio that allows for alternative assets, according to James Seyffart, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. In a report from Thursday, Michael Gates, lead portfolio manager for BlackRock’s Target Allocation ETF models, wrote that there are “several substantive arguments that support bitcoin’s long-term investment merit.” According to Gates, this includes the crypto asset’s novel store of value and global monetary alternative, as well as hedge to the U.S. dollar hegemony and political instability, and proxy play on the “offline” to “online” digital transition of goods and services. “Collectively, these features may help provide unique and additive sources of risk premia and diversification to traditional multi-asset portfolios,” Gates wrote. The model represents one of IBIT’s smaller portfolios, however, the step is significant given that it is the first time BlackRock had made the decision to add IBIT to any of their models. “This is a big deal because this is the first of those models to add bitcoin,” said Seyffart. “It probably won’t be the last but bitcoin is also a lightning rod for many — some will hate this while others will love it — so I don’t know if or when they would add IBIT to their primary models that have a lot more money tracking them.” BlackRock’s model portfolios manage around $150 billion in assets as of December 31, 2024.

While SOL has bounced a little in the past hour, its losses across the past few weeks have been substantial, standing at 25% in a week and 44% in a month. And today’s latest dive has really set off a wave of negativity in the market, with one analyst – known by their X handle of JACKIS – now predicting that the Solana price will drop to $100 before it recovers fully. Given the current mood and trajectory of the market, such a fall is entirely possible in the near term, yet Solana’s fundamentals should enable the coin to recover substantially in the longer term . Solana Price Forecast – Crypto Expert Predicts How Low SOL Will Fall by Next Spring Solana’s chart today shows the alt nearing a hard bottom, with its indicators strongly signalling that it should rebound soon. Probably the most significant feature is the fact that its 30-day average (orange) has formed a ‘death cross’ with the 200-day (blue), indicative of a big selloff. Source: TradingView Well, this selloff appears to be happening right now, with SOL’s relative strength index (purple) dropping below 30 today. Previous bottoms have tended to lead into rallies, as we saw in mid-December and mid-January. Yet some analysts seem to think that the Solana price will not recover immediately, and that we may have to endure several more days or even weeks of losses. This is the view of online trader JACKIS, for example, who predicted yesterday that SOL will slide down to $100 before it enjoys a concerted recovery. In fact, some traders are even more pessimistic than this, with TylerBueno noting that it could replicate the fall it witnessed back in 2022/23, when it dropped from $250 to $8. The next time someone says $SOL can't hit a lower price target, show them this chart: last cycle, the price dropped from $250 to $8 over 420 days from market peak to bear market low. pic.twitter.com/YlDhhOdOjc — TylerBueno (@TheTylerBueno) February 26, 2025 Not everyone, however, believes that further dives are coming, with Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal highlighting yesterday how various indicators show SOL as massively oversold. SOL is 2 standard deviations oversold on the log regression channel, with the lowest RSI since the 2022 lows. Probability is wildly on favour of significantly higher prices in the next month. I have zero cash to add but this is the sweet spot around here pic.twitter.com/Pfy4tbkdYu — Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) February 27, 2025 While Pal may be optimistic insofar as the near term is concerned, Solana’s fundamentals certainly support the notion that SOL deserves a much higher price. Not only is Solana the second-biggest layer-one network in terms of TVL , but it has updates on the horizon – such as the Firedancer upgrade – that will only strengthen its status as one of the best platforms for meme coins and DeFi. Based on its underlying strength and utility, the Solana price should return to $150 at some point in Q2, before rising back up to $250 by Q4. Layer-Two Platform Aims to Turbocharge Solana Since SOL may not do that much for the next few weeks, traders may be eager for alternatives, which, during a bear market, usually means newer and more volatile small-cap tokens. The problem is, it can be very hard to determine which new coin is going to outperform the market, given the sheer number of them. But one way of narrowing the field is to look for the biggest presale coins, which can often rally big when they list for the first time. A good example of a very promising presale token is Solaxy (SOLX) , which has the distinction of being Solana’s first ever layer-two network. https://x.com/SOLAXYTOKEN/status/1894609319729271288 It has raised a whopping $23.8 million in its ongoing presale, with investors excited by its strong fundamentals and market potential. As an L2, Solaxy will provide Solana users with faster transactions and lower fees, while it will also enable instant bridging between itself and its parent network. Its team will add compatibility with other chains over time, making it accessible and attractive to a greater number of traders and developers. And given that SOLX will be necessary to pay transaction fees, the coin is likely to experience very strong demand. Investors can join its sale by going to the Solaxy website , where SOLX is currently selling at $0.001648. This price will rise later today, and all the early signs suggest that it could explode once it lists in the next few weeks.

The firm is adding a 1% to 2% allocation of the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) to its target allocation portfolios that allow for alternatives, as per a Bloomberg report. While this represents a small subset of BlackRock’s overall model-portfolio business, it marks a significant step in integrating Bitcoin into mainstream investment strategies. Model portfolios, which bundle funds into ready-made investment strategies for financial advisers, have grown in prominence in recent years. Changes to these portfolios can trigger substantial capital flows, making BlackRock’s decision noteworthy at a time when cryptocurrency sentiment remains weak. “We believe Bitcoin has long-term investment merit and can potentially provide unique and additive sources of diversification to portfolios,” wrote Michael Gates, lead portfolio manager for BlackRock’s Target Allocation ETF model suite, in investment commentary dated February 27. BTC price continues slide The move comes amid declining Bitcoin prices and broader market uncertainty. Bitcoin’s decline extended into Thursday night and Friday, dropping over 7% in a matter of hours from above $84,000 to below $79,000. This comes after the cryptocurrency entered a technical bear market earlier in the week. For the week, Bitcoin has fallen more than 18%, sliding from Monday’s high of $96,500 to a low of $78,258 on Friday—its steepest weekly drop in three years. The token has now corrected nearly 30% from its all-time high of $109,588, reached on January 20. Bitcoin’s well-documented volatility was a key consideration in BlackRock’s decision to limit the portfolio weighting to a range of 1% to 2%, as outlined in a December paper from the BlackRock Investment Institute. The firm warned that exceeding a 2% allocation would significantly raise crypto’s share of overall portfolio risk. Despite recent outflows, IBIT remains one of the most successful ETF launches in history. Since its debut in January 2024, the fund has attracted more than $37 billion in inflows. According to BlackRock, demand for Bitcoin exposure within model portfolios remains strong, providing a potential source of future inflows. Alongside the IBIT allocation, BlackRock made several other portfolio adjustments. Cooling earnings expectations prompted the firm to trim its equity overweight to 3% from 4%, while bringing its tilt toward growth strategies closer in line with value trades. In fixed income, BlackRock reduced its long-duration exposure, shifting billions of dollars between its products. One of the most notable moves was a record $2.3 billion inflow into the iShares 10-20 Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLH), while $1.8 billion exited the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT). BTC ETF outflows Bitcoin ETFs, however, faced significant outflows. On Thursday, BlackRock’s IBIT saw $189 million in net redemptions, the largest among spot Bitcoin ETFs. WisdomTree’s BTCW and Valkyrie’s BRRR recorded the second and third highest outflows at $53.7 million and $12.8 million, respectively. Meanwhile, Ark & 21Shares, Invesco, and Hashdex saw no notable fund movements, while Bitwise’s BITB was the only spot BTC ETF in the US to record net inflows, adding $17.6 million. Over the past eight days , total outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs—including those from BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale—have surpassed $3.2 billion. The heaviest redemptions occurred earlier in the week, with net outflows of $1.1 billion on February 25 and $754 million on February 26. Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted that Bitcoin ETFs were “feeling the pinch” but emphasized that the outflows represent less than 2% of total assets, suggesting that most investors are holding their positions. Despite the recent withdrawals, Bitcoin ETFs have performed strongly in 2024, with net inflows reaching $36.85 billion. Total net assets across all spot Bitcoin ETFs currently stand at over $94.3 billion, representing approximately 5.69% of Bitcoin’s total market capitalization.

These blockchain ventures have built strong use cases, gained market traction, and positioned themselves for significant growth. While HNT and Kaspa have made waves, Qubetics is stealing the spotlight with its explosive presale, innovative features, and major partnerships. With more than 491 million tokens sold in its ongoing presale, Qubetics is proving itself as a major contender in the crypto space. But what makes it different from the rest? And how do HNT and Kaspa compare? Let’s break it all down. Qubetics ($TICS): The New Powerhouse in Blockchain Qubetics isn’t just another Layer-1 blockchain—it’s an ecosystem designed for speed, security, and accessibility. At the core of Qubetics’ appeal is its Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet, which allows users to manage multiple assets across different blockchains seamlessly. Security and transparency are top priorities, with the project undergoing a comprehensive CertiK audit to ensure a rock-solid foundation before its mainnet launch. This is a critical step in establishing trust and long-term credibility. A key milestone for Qubetics is its partnership with 1inch, a leading DeFi aggregator that optimizes decentralized trading. Through this integration, Qubetics Wallet users gain access to the best trading rates across hundreds of decentralized exchanges, making it easier to swap assets at the most competitive prices. But that’s not all—Qubetics has also teamed up with SWFT Blockchain, a move that takes its wallet innovation to the next level. The integration allows for lightning-fast, cross-chain transactions, giving users flexibility, security, and efficiency in one place. The numbers don’t lie. Qubetics is currently in the 23rd stage of its crypto presale , with each $TICS token priced at $0.0888. Analysts predict that once the presale ends, the price could jump to $0.25, offering a staggering 181.52% return. If it reaches $1 after the presale, that’s a 1026% ROI. And if it hits $15 after the mainnet launch, early adopters could be looking at a jaw-dropping 16,791% return. With over 21,600 holders already on board, the buzz is only growing louder. CertiK Validates Qubetics: A Game-Changer for Security and Trust Qubetics is making waves in the blockchain space, and its recent CertiK audit is a major milestone in proving its credibility. CertiK, the industry’s top blockchain security firm, is conducting a comprehensive audit of Qubetics’ non-custodial multi-chain wallet and blockchain ecosystem. This deep-dive security assessment ensures that Qubetics meets the highest standards of reliability, transparency, and protection against vulnerabilities. With CertiK’s seal of approval, Qubetics is positioning itself as a top-tier blockchain project built for the future. The audit not only reinforces trust among its growing community but also strengthens its appeal to businesses, professionals, and everyday crypto users looking for a secure, efficient, and scalable blockchain solution. As Qubetics gears up for its mainnet launch, this validation from CertiK adds another layer of confidence, making it one of the most promising projects in the crypto space. Helium (HNT): The Wireless Revolution Continues Helium has built a name for itself by decentralizing wireless connectivity. The Helium Network allows users to set up personal hotspots and earn HNT tokens in exchange for providing network coverage. This innovative model has disrupted the traditional telecom industry, making it a favorite among those who believe in the future of decentralized infrastructure. One of the biggest developments for Helium has been its transition to Solana. While some were skeptical about the move, the shift has improved the network’s scalability and speed. By leveraging Solana’s high-performance blockchain, Helium can now support an even larger ecosystem of connected devices. This could be a game-changer, especially with the rise of IoT and smart city applications. Despite facing regulatory hurdles, Helium’s real-world use case keeps it relevant. As more businesses and individuals adopt decentralized wireless technology, HNT has the potential to see steady long-term growth. But does it offer the same kind of short-term upside as Qubetics? That’s where things get interesting. Kaspa (KAS): The Fastest Proof-of-Work Blockchain? Kaspa has emerged as one of the most exciting Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains, boasting unmatched speed and scalability. Unlike traditional PoW blockchains like Bitcoin, Kaspa uses the DAG protocol, which allows multiple blocks to be confirmed simultaneously. This unique architecture significantly reduces confirmation times, making Kaspa a top choice for those looking for efficiency in PoW networks. Another factor working in Kaspa’s favor is its fair launch. There was no pre-mine or early investor advantage, making it one of the most decentralized blockchain projects in the space. The project has gained traction among miners and developers who appreciate its strong security and rapid transaction speeds. However, PoW blockchains often face challenges related to energy consumption, which could impact Kaspa’s long-term adoption as the industry shifts toward eco-friendly solutions. While Kaspa’s price has been on a steady upward trend, it doesn’t have the same explosive presale opportunities that Qubetics currently offers. But for those who believe in the longevity of PoW blockchains, Kaspa is definitely one to watch. Why Qubetics’ Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet and 1inch Partnership Change Everything One of the biggest hurdles in crypto is navigating multiple blockchains, wallets, and exchanges. Qubetics eliminates this friction with its Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet, which allows users to manage, store, and swap assets across different chains without depending on third parties. This means users maintain full control of their funds while enjoying an ultra-secure and seamless experience. The integration with 1inch supercharges this ecosystem by ensuring that users always get the best possible trading rates. Instead of hopping from one DEX to another to find the best deal, traders can execute optimized swaps directly from the Qubetics Wallet. The added layer of security, speed, and efficiency makes Qubetics a go-to platform for both newcomers and seasoned traders. And let’s not forget about Qubetics’ blockchain audit. With CertiK reviewing the entire infrastructure, the project is positioning itself as a secure and trustworthy option in an industry where security breaches are all too common. This is a major win for anyone looking for the best cryptos to join for the long term. Final Thoughts: Which Crypto Should You Bet On? HNT and Kaspa have proven themselves in the crypto space, but Qubetics is making waves with its aggressive growth, top-tier partnerships, and lucrative presale. The numbers speak for themselves. With $14.2 million already raised, over 21,600 holders, and massive ROI potential, Qubetics is shaping up to be a force to be reckoned with. If you’re looking for a long-term crypto with real utility, innovation, and major upside, Qubetic s is the one to watch. The presale won’t last forever, and by the time the mainnet launches, the opportunity to get in at these prices will be long gone. The question is, will you be ahead of the curve or left wondering what could have been? For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What makes Qubetics different from other cryptos? Qubetics is a Layer-1 blockchain with a Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet, 1inch integration, and a CertiK audit, ensuring security, efficiency, and seamless cross-chain transactions. Is Qubetics a good long-term investment? With over 491 million tokens sold and an expected 16,791% ROI after the mainnet launch, Qubetics presents one of the best long-term opportunities in crypto. Why is Helium migrating to Solana? Helium is moving to Solana to improve scalability, transaction speed, and network efficiency, making it more competitive in the IoT and decentralized wireless space. How does Kaspa compare to Bitcoin? Kaspa is a PoW blockchain like Bitcoin but offers faster transactions through its DAG protocol, making it one of the most efficient PoW networks. Where can I buy Qubetics tokens? You can purchase $TICS tokens directly from the ongoing presale before the price rises. Don’t wait until it’s too late!

Not through direct intervention, but through fiscal policy. The US president’s Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) is on a mission for massive spending cuts and federal layoffs, and economists generally agree it will slow down the economy, giving the Fed no choice but to lower rates. It’s actually the perfect setup if you think about it whether Fed Chair Jerome Powell likes it or not. Moving on, monetary policy and fiscal policy are moving in opposite directions right now. The Fed hiked rates aggressively from March 2022 until November 2024 in efforts to fight inflation, which took the rates up over 5 percentage points in just a year, the largest in 50 years. Meanwhile, the federal government (under former president Joe Biden) racked up a $4.2 trillion deficit from 2022-2024. Now with Trump back in office trying to cut $2 trillion in govt spending, the entire game is likely gonna flip. Trump could easily force the Fed’s hand Now, the US Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, says Trump wants to bring the deficit down to 3% of GDP. That would require massive cuts from labor, whether the economy is ready for it or not. Consumer sentiment dropped for the first time in six months in January. The Bloomberg US Financial Conditions Index fell 37% in just two weeks, and the Atlanta Fed cut its GDP growth estimate in half, from 4% to 2.3% in just a month. The 10-year Treasury yield fell 50 basis points, heading toward a very dangerous recession signal. If the US economy slows down too much, the Fed will have to cut rates. There’s no getting around it. The latest core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) report, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, still sits at 2.8%, above its 2% target. But if growth tanks and unemployment rises, Powell’s team won’t have much of a choice. The Fed can’t hold off forever if the labor market weakens and spending dries up. The mere threat of these D.O.G.E cuts is already messing with economic sentiment. If businesses and investors expect less government spending, they’ll hold back on hiring and investing, squeezing growth some more. Financial markets are already reacting, and investors are scared Trump’s fiscal policy change is a big deal for investors, and so the bond market is already pricing in rate cuts, and that’s a warning sign. It tells us investors expect the Fed to cut rates sooner rather than later, and they’re pretty desperate about it too. Powell can keep saying inflation is the priority, but if GDP growth slumps and unemployment rises, the Fed will act as the central bank and won’t want to risk a recession just to keep inflation in check. There’s one problem, though. With Trump’s new tariffs on Mexico, Canada, China, and potentially the European Union, inflation could spike again even as growth slows. That’s the worst-case scenario—stagflation. If that happens, the Fed might have to hike rates instead of cutting them, and stocks and cryptos will react pretty strongly to that, as they always have. Meanwhile, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is reviewing its interest rate framework from the current one that was introduced in 2020 and built for a low-inflation world. It failed spectacularly when inflation surged in 2021, thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic. Under the 2020 policy, the Fed promised to keep rates near zero until unemployment was low and inflation stayed above 2% for a while. That backfired because by the time the Fed hiked rates in 2022, inflation had already hit 5%, and the US economy was overheating.

The market crash, which saw investors lose billions, left many reeling, particularly after the sharp crash in the last week, referred to by some analysts as the ‘Trump-dump.’ Despite this, increased activity by major investors, or ‘whales,’ around the market’s dip suggests a potential strong recovery as March approaches. Investors Prepare for Comeback Following Trump-Dump February’s market crash was primarily triggered by Donald Trump’s proposal of a 25% tariff on the European Union combined with a $1.5 billion hack at the Bybit exchange. These events led to massive liquidations, plummeting Bitcoin to a three-month low of under $80K. Arthur Hayes, the former CEO of BitMEX and now Chief Investment Officer at Maelstrom, had earlier anticipated a significant market downturn, which he dubbed a “Trump dump,” following the commencement of Trump’s administration. He predicted that the challenges in implementing Trump’s pro-crypto policies, such as establishing a Bitcoin reserve and creating a crypto-friendly atmosphere, would become apparent to investors. Hayes expected that the market decline, referred to as the “Trump dump,” would conclude by March, leading to a recovery. Notably, despite the dip in Bitcoin prices, several institutions, including Microstrategy, continued purchasing Bitcoin, viewing the lower prices as an opportunity to accumulate more at a discount.

Moreover, despite the recent decline in Bitcoin’s value, Kiyosaki remains bullish on its long-term potential, describing it as “money with integrity” in contrast to what he calls “fake money.” He expressed enthusiasm during market lows, saying, “When Bitcoin crashes, I smile and buy more.” March Has Been Bullish Since 2021 Historically, March has seen positive trends in the crypto market, with Bitcoin and Ethereum both averaging gains of nearly 17% over the past four years, according to data from Coinglass. However, this year’s outlook might shift due to increasing inflation and a strengthening DXY. The market has already felt the impact of significant ETF volume outflows, and continued outflows in March could push the market to new lows. On a positive note, the recent release of the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) data, which shows a decline to 2.6%, has brought some hope into the market. The focus now turns to the upcoming nonfarm payroll (NFP) report, with economists expecting a decrease to 133k in February from 143k in January, as polled by Reuters, while the unemployment rate is projected to stay at 4.0%. Moving forward, the release of the CPI data on March 12 will be crucial. Any bearish outcomes could plunge the chances of a market rebound. In such a scenario, Bitcoin’s price might consolidate between $70K and $90K throughout March, depending on the broader macroeconomic news. This could significantly affect altcoins, determining whether they will drop to new lows, consolidate, or reach new highs.",News|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Crypto Regulations|Ethereum|Meme Coins|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-28 17:17:48

According to a Bloomberg report on Feb. 28, the asset manager will allocate 1% to 2% of its Bitcoin ( BTC ) exchange-traded fund to target model investment portfolios. These allocations, sourced from the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF under the ticker IBIT, will be directed toward the company’s portfolios that include alternative investments. In the investment world, model portfolios are pre-structured funds designed to offer ready-made strategies. They provide managed investment strategies that invest in fund shares and are marketed to financial advisors. Model portfolios have seen significant growth across the market, driven in part by rising interest in digital assets and crypto exchange-traded products.

According to Bloomberg, BlackRock plans to allocate 1% to 2% of IBIT into its $150 billion model portfolio. Although this $150 billion pool represents a small portion of BlackRock’s overall model portfolio business, the inclusion of IBIT could significantly boost demand for the spot Bitcoin ETF. Michael Gates, lead portfolio manager for target allocation ETF models at BlackRock, reiterated the company’s confidence in Bitcoin as an investment. “We believe Bitcoin has long-term investment merit and can potentially provide unique and additive sources of diversification to portfolios,” Gates said in a note to investors on Feb. 27. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved IBIT and several other spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. BlackRock, Fidelity Investments, WisdomTree, and VanEck were among the firms that received regulatory approval for the listing and trading of Bitcoin ETFs. Investor demand for these funds helped push Bitcoin’s price above $69,000 in March 2024. Later, heightened interest amid the U.S. election cycle propelled Bitcoin to an all-time high above $109,000. However, a sell-off has since driven BTC down to $79,000, with significant outflows from spot ETFs, including IBIT, in the past week.

However, a breakout above $0.00001461 could trigger bullish momentum and a 230% price rally. SHIB’s Freefall Could Stop Here The meme coin sector has suffered painful losses following the overall crypto market crash in the past few days. The second-largest asset of that type – Shiba Inu (SHIB) – was among the worst affected, with its price plummeting by 16% weekly and 10% daily. SHIB Price, Source: CoinGecko Its market capitalization plunged below $7.7 billion, meaning the asset is now out of crypto’s top 20 club . As expected, the downtrend has negatively affected SHIB’s investors. According to IntoTheBlock’s data, the share of people sitting at paper losses has surged past 60%. One person touching upon SHIB’s recent performance was Ali Martinez . The analyst assumed that the price of the meme coin could decline to $0.000012 or $0.0000094 before finding support. The second level represents a 30% decline from the current rate. Another industry participant who chipped in on the matter was the X user Rose Premium Signals. They envisioned a bullish momentum if SHIB breaks above $0.00001461. The analyst predicted that reclaiming the target could lead to a price rally to as high as $0.00004401 (a 230% increase from the ongoing valuation). More Pain Ahead? Two important factors signal that SHIB bears might continue to prevail in the short term. The first is the reduced Shibarium activity. At the beginning of the month, Shiba Inu’s layer-2 scaling solution processed multi-million transactions on a daily scale, but in the past few weeks, this figure has shrunk substantially. This suggests decreased interest in the network’s applications, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), NFT projects, or gaming platforms. For its part, this could lower demand for SHIB tokens and reduce the buying pressure. The next factor is Shiba Inu’s burning mechanism. The burn rate has dropped by 16% in the last 24 hours, resulting in around 25 million tokens sent to a null address. The program’s ultimate goal is to reduce the tremendous circulating supply of SHIB, possibly making the asset more valuable via scarcity. However, stalled progress could hinder that mission.

BlackRock has set aside 1% to 2% of its $48 billion iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (ticker: IBIT) in target allocation portfolios that allow for alternative investments, according to an investment outlook obtained by Bloomberg. While that’s a small portion of BlackRock’s overall model portfolio business, the move could pave the way for new demand for IBIT at a time when overall crypto sentiment is weakening. Model portfolios, which combine various funds into structured investment strategies for financial advisors, have grown in popularity in recent years. Changes to these portfolios can trigger significant capital flows in both directions. “We believe Bitcoin has long-term investment value and can potentially provide unique and additional sources of diversification to portfolios,” Michael Gates, chief portfolio manager for BlackRock’s Target Allocation ETF model portfolio suite, said in an investment commentary. Related News: JUST IN: Trump's New Cryptocurrency Project Is Announced! What is He Up To Again? The timing of BlackRock’s decision coincides with Bitcoin’s recent price decline. Market uncertainty and economic concerns have weighed on risk appetite, with BTC currently trading around $83,000, a sharp drop from last month’s peak of $110,000. Citing Bitcoin’s known volatility, the BlackRock Investment Institute set a “reasonable range” of 1% to 2% in a December report. The report warned that exceeding a 2% allocation could disproportionately increase a portfolio’s overall risk exposure. Launched in January 2024, IBIT has quickly become one of the most successful ETF launches in history, bringing in over $37 billion in inflows last year alone. But appetite has weakened recently, with investors pulling out nearly $900 million last week. Despite this, BlackRock noted continued demand from financial advisors looking for structured exposure to Bitcoin within model portfolios. “They all want to allocate more to alternatives, but they need guidance on how to size, scale and rebalance the position,” said Eve Cout, head of portfolio design and solutions at BlackRock US Wealth. A model portfolio is a pre-built investment strategy tool that financial advisors use for their clients. It combines different assets (stocks, bonds, ETFs, etc.) in a structured way to fit specific risk and return objectives. That is, BlackRock does not directly purchase Bitcoin like MicroStrategy does, but it does offer exposure to BTC through IBIT in its investment strategies. *This is not investment advice.

However, the total value of assets locked in the Solana chain is down $5.26 billion from its peak, a nearly 50% drop. TVL represents demand and relevance for a chain, meaning Solana is negatively affected by the shifting market dynamics.

TVL tracked on DeFiLlama shows that Solana is slowly losing relevance in the ongoing crypto market cycle. SOL TVL is down from its peak of $12.191 billion to $6.939 billion at the time of writing. This marks a nearly 50% drop in TVL of the chain. One of the leading catalysts behind the decline is the crash of meme coins on the SOL chain. Solana TVL Chart | Source: DeFiLlama In the past month, the top 10 protocols on the Solana blockchain erased up to 40% in TVL. The top three catalysts influencing this change are Bitcoin’s flash crash, meme coin controversies surrounding MELANIA ( MELANIA ) token and LIBRA meme coin ( LIBRA ), price decline in Official Trump ( TRUMP ) token, and crypto traders turning risk-averse in response to U.S. macroeconomic developments. The three market movers have contributed to capital outflows from the top 10 Solana protocols and leading meme coins on the SOL chain.

More than half of the Solana-based meme coins were corrected in double-digits in the last seven days. Solana-based meme coins | Source: CoinGecko The stats suggest there is a shift in market dynamics and both capital and attention of traders are shifting from the “meme coin” sector to other categories of crypto tokens. Bitfinex analysts evaluated the recent events in the market and observed that the launch of a meme coin associated with the U.S. President, albeit one that led to significant losses and a liquidity drain across other meme coins on the Solana network, is a negative catalyst for the category.

The news comes after MetaMask’s roadmap release where the browser-based cryptocurrency wallet discusses the addition of native Solana support, in May 2025. Solana is the first non-EVM chain supported by the browser wallet and it adds the functionality to buy, sell, swap and interact with dApps across the entire SOL ecosystem. All existing users of the chain will get access to the same features of MetaMask that Ethereum users enjoy alongside other chains supported by the wallet. Bitcoin’s recovery and BTC regaining $80,000 support after a flash crash on Friday is one of the key drivers in the crypto market. Solana and Bitcoin enjoy a 0.83 correlation in the three-month timeframe. Bitcoin’s price changes therefore influence the Solana price trend. Bitcoin’s re-test of support at $95,000 and a rally towards the $100,000 milestone are the two developments that could positively impact Solana price trend in the coming weeks, while the tokens are heavily correlated. SOL on-chain analysis Solana’s on-chain metrics show signs of recovery in the token in the coming weeks. After several days of negative funding rate on Binance, Solana observes positive funding or a bullish bias among derivatives traders on Friday. The total open interest, a metric that tracks the value of all open derivatives contracts in Solana, rises, climbs to over $2.26 billion on February 28. SOL price recovered after weeks of downward trend, up nearly 6% on the day. The rising open interest and positive funding rate are supportive of a bullish thesis for Solana’s recovery in the medium to short-term. Solana on-chain analysis | Source: Santiment Solana price forecast Solana could break its multi-month downward trend with a daily candlestick close in the resistance zone between $147.09 and $166.42. These two levels mark the upper and lower boundary of a fair value gap, an inefficiency in the market. Once SOL breaks past the resistance zone, the next key level for traders is resistance at $180. The $180 level has acted as support for nearly three months, making it a key level for SOL. A daily candlestick close above this level could prepare Solana for a retest of the $200 level, a key milestone for SOL. Technical indicators on the daily timeframe, RSI, and MACD support the thesis. RSI reads 32 and is sloping upwards, above the “oversold” zone for Solana. MACD shows waning negative momentum underlying SOL price trend. SOL/USDT daily price chart | Source: Crypto.news Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research commented on Solana’s recent price action, the recent events like Bybit hack and Bitcoin ETF outflows. Ryan Lee shared the following comments with Crypto.news in an exclusive interview: “Trump’s new tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico have rocked the crypto market, driving Solana’s 40% TVL decline, worsened by the Bybit hack and over $2 billion in Bitcoin ETF outflows, reflecting weakened investor confidence and liquidity strain. A bearish outlook suggests Solana faces stagnation if trade tensions escalate, inflation rises, or risk aversion intensifies. The trajectory hinges on Bitcoin’s price trend, China’s response, Federal Reserve actions, and whether Trump’s regulatory support counterbalances macroeconomic headwinds. Critical developments are expected within the next 30 days, making this period pivotal for market clarity.” Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

Bank of England policymaker warns of rising inflation Speaking in South Africa on Friday, the Bank of England deputy governor supported the gradual central bank’s approach to the rate cuts. He highlighted increased uncertainty in the economy due to the stronger-than-expected pay growth. Having joined his #MPC colleagues in cutting interest rates earlier this month, Dave Ramsden is clearly having second thoughts and is now highlighting inflation risks. Expect more of this from other MPC members as UK inflation surges to 4pc and beyond! https://t.co/qwbGqA3oLq — Andrew Sentance (@asentance) February 28, 2025 The deputy governor said he saw a two-sided risk to the inflation outlook and had become less confident about the UK’s labor market outlook. He explained that pay growth had overshot the Bank of England’s expectations. Ramsden added that the Central Bank predicted consumer price inflation would accelerate to 3.7 per cent later in the year. He pointed out that this would sway the bank’s stance to lower its interest rates further. The Bank of England announced it would cut its rate by a quarter point in February, citing slow economic growth and increased inflation. The rate cutter advocated for a quarter-point rate reduction in the monetary policy committee meeting in December. However, most committee members voted against further rate cuts and held the interest rates. In the February meeting, he voted with the majority for lowering rate cuts to 4.5%. Data from the Office for National Statistics(ONS) revealed that the U.K.’s inflation rate rose by 3% in January, above the 2.8% analyst expectations. Britain’s consumer price index(CPI) decreased to 2.5% in December, with core price growth slowing further. Core inflation rose by 3.7% in the 12 months to January, a 3.2% increase from the previous month. Grant Fitzner, ONS chief economist, commented that inflation rose sharply this month to its highest annual rate since March last year. Fitzner added that the rise was due to airfares failing to decline as expected. He said that this was the weakest January dip since 2020. BOE deputy governor raises concerns over the falling labor market Ramsden said that due to the evidence seen in recent months, he no longer thought that risks to hitting the 2 per cent inflation target sustainably in the medium term were to the downside. He added that he felt it was two-sided and reflected the potential for more inflationary and disinflationary scenarios. The deputy governor noted concerning developments in the short-term indicators, especially on wages. He pointed out that fourth-quarter annual growth in private sector earnings increased to 6.2 per cent from 4.9 per cent. Ramsden suggested that pay growth should maintain its current level this quarter, a percentage point higher than expected in 2024. He added that the labor demand could decrease with falling vacancies and reduced job growth. The policymaker stressed that his central view was that the disinflationary process remained intact. He added that given the increased uncertainty and risks to inflation from the near-term outlook and developments in the global economy, a gradual approach to withdrawing monetary restraint would be more necessary. Ramasden’s comments came after the Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey warned that the U.K. was experiencing a weaker economy. He added that amid the global economy’s uncertainty, it was unclear whether inflation would ease in the near future. The governor added that the current global fragmentation caused by Trump’s administration in the United States was bad for global economic growth. Trump announced that he would impose trade tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico, which led to a tumble in global markets. The U.S. president also announced that he would impose more tariffs against the European Union this week. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

40968530,https://coingape.com/?p=241667,1740764547,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,"BlackRock Adds Bitcoin ETF to Model Portfolio, Here’s All",https://coingape.com/blackrock-adds-bitcoin-etf-to-model-portfolio-heres-all/,"BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has incorporated Bitcoin into its $150 billion model portfolio framework. The company has added a 1% to 2% allocation of the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) to its target allocation portfolios, which accommodate alternative assets. BlackRock Introduces Bitcoin ETF in Model Portfolios According to a recent Bloomberg report , BlackRock has included Bitcoin in its investment strategy by allocating a small portion of its model portfolios to IBIT. The asset manager’s model portfolios are designed to provide structured investment strategies to financial advisers. The allocation of IBIT is set between 1% and 2%, as BlackRock considers this range reasonable for balancing risk and diversification. The firm has stated that Bitcoin can offer long-term investment potential while adding diversification benefits to portfolios. BlackRock’s model portfolios influence large capital flows, as they combine various funds into ready-made investment strategies. With IBIT now included, institutional exposure to Bitcoin may increase, depending on demand from financial advisers and investors. Bitcoin ETF Inflows Show Mixed Trends Bitcoin ETF inflows have slowed in recent weeks despite IBIT’s strong launch in early 2024. Investors pulled approximately $900 million from Bitcoin ETFs over the past week. This outflow comes after a period of high demand, where IBIT saw record inflows of $37 billion last year. Consequently, according to a recent CoinGape report, the Bitcoin ETF outflows could trigger further downside pressure on BTC and the crypto market. With institutional investors reducing exposure, Bitcoin price may struggle to regain key support levels. Despite the slowdown, BlackRock maintains confidence in Bitcoin’s role within a diversified portfolio. The firm’s investment team emphasized the importance of guiding advisers on the appropriate allocation and management of Bitcoin exposure. Meanwhile, BlackRock continues to adjust its overall portfolio allocation, including a reduction in long-duration fixed-income exposure. These changes reflect the company’s broader market strategy in response to economic conditions and investor sentiment. Bitcoin Price Volatility and Market Outlook Meanwhile, Bitcoin has experienced price fluctuations recently. The cryptocurrency is currently trading around $84,000, down from nearly $110,000 last month. Market conditions, economic concerns, and global trade tensions have contributed to the decline. BlackRock’s decision to limit Bitcoin ETF exposure to a maximum of 2% aligns with its risk assessment. The firm previously stated that higher allocations would disproportionately increase portfolio risk. This cautious approach suggests that BlackRock is positioning Bitcoin as an alternative asset rather than a core holding. Additionally, with BTC price flashing bear market signals, ARK Invest offloaded $9M in spot BTC ETFs, adding to selling pressure. Institutional exits and weak demand suggest further downside risks for Bitcoin. If BTC fails to reclaim key levels, the bearish trend could deepen.

We tell you what schemes North Korean hackers are using to launder their crypto loot and cover up their crimes. How Bybit Lost $1.4 Billion On February 21, 2025, reports about the hacking of one of the largest crypto exchanges Bybit appeared online. The first results of analyzing the incident led researchers to Lazarus Group, the most famous of North Korean hacker groups. Despite the loss of $1.4 billion Bybit was able to maintain its reputation thanks to the prompt response and support of the crypto community. The exchange received financial assistance from platforms such as Binance and Bitget and coordinated the return of funds through a rewards system. The attack appeared identical to the WazirX and Radiant Capital hacks in 2024. The hacker is known to have attacked Bybit's multi-signature cold wallet. Although similar hacks had happened before, the cryptocurrency exchange's system was unprepared for such a challenge and North Koreans got their money again. How Lazarus Group's Money Laundering Scheme Works After the Bybit hack, Lazarus Group began applying its well-known laundering strategy, which involves converting illiquid assets into more liquid ones. According to analytics platforms Nansen and Chainalysis, the group began by converting $200 million of previously staked coins into ETH, which is much easier to move online. The process was part of a more complex scheme to obfuscate trails and minimize traceability. To conceal its actions, Lazarus used a variety of money laundering tools, including decentralized exchanges, crosschain bridges, and instant exchange services that do not require KYC. In the laundering process, funds were split into multiple parts and sent to different wallets, making them difficult to identify and trace. According to Chainalysis, funds were also moving through multiple intermediate wallets, creating a confusing trail. Arkham analysts found that the hackers used THORCHAIN, among other things, in their work. According to their data, the attackers have already laundered at least $240 million worth of cryptocurrency through the network. Presumably, the fraudsters chose THORCHAIN because the platform allows direct crypto exchanges between different chains without the need to work with “wrapped” coins. This helps hide the origin and destination of the funds. Arkham believes that the hackers exchanged already laundered coins for bitcoins. In addition, the group used a “sit and wait” strategy. Some wallets with stolen funds remained inactive for a certain period of time, which allowed them to be taken out of the crosshairs. This strategy allows Lazarus to avoid increased scrutiny of their actions and gives them time to reallocate funds without much risk. Conclusion The Bybit hack was a prime example of how, amid the growing popularity of cryptocurrency, criminal groups such as Lazarus continue to use digital assets as a tool to finance their goals. The incident poses serious challenges to the crypto industry, requiring not only improved security, but also tighter regulation to prevent crypto from being used for shady operations.",News|Security,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|ASIA|ARKM|BNB|ETH,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-28 17:50:34

According to Winklevoss, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has informed Gemini lawyer Jack Baughman that it has concluded its investigation and will not pursue an enforcement action against the platform. The SEC has already dropped its case against the crypto exchange Coinbase and is shutting down investigations into the non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace OpenSea, the retail trading app Robinhood and the decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX) UniSwap. Winklevoss says these developments mark a milestone signifying the end of the SEC’s “war on crypto,” but the Gemini co-founder argues they still do little to make up for the damage caused by the agency. “The SEC cost us tens of millions of dollars in legal bills alone and hundreds of millions in lost productivity, creativity, and innovation. Of course, Gemini is not alone. The SEC’s behavior in aggregate towards other crypto companies and projects cost orders of magnitude more and caused unquantifiable loss in economic growth for America.” To deter abuses, Winklevoss says regulatory agencies should reimburse three times the legal expense for initiating investigations or enforcement actions without first establishing the rules. He also proposes lifetime bans for regulatory officials who “weaponize the law.” “We will not rebuild trust and integrity in federal agencies unless there are serious consequences for bad faith actors.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

In early-hours Feb. 28, the price had dipped below $80,000. CoinDesk’s Market Index, which tracks the broader digital assets market, has fallen 12% in the last five days. CoinDesk’s Markets Editor Omkar Godbole analyzed the daily price action, tracking ETF outflows , historical analogies , and macro correlations . On the regulatory front, the SEC dropped major cases against Uniswap , Coinbase , and MetaMask (ConsenSys) . It also sought to end a fraud case against TRON and Justin Sun . Our regulatory team of Nik De, Jesse Hamilton and Cheyenne Ligon were all over the news, as usual. Meanwhile, it looks like the SEC will not be treating memecoins as securities , Ligon reported. Stablecoins were another big theme, as issuers argued over the parameters of a new law covering the most used form of digital assets. Jeremy Allaire, co-founder and CEO of stablecoin issuer Circle, said USD-backed stablecoin issuers should be required to register in the U.S. , in a clear tilt at Circle’s biggest rival, Tether (regulatory reporter Camomile Shumba had that). Meanwhile, Bank of America said it planned to launch its own stablecoin , Helene Braun wrote. In other important news, Ian Allison reported exclusively that BitMEX, an OG trading platform, was up for sale. Bybit passed blame for its $1.5 billion hack (Oliver Knight reported). Ethereum Foundation’s executive director Aya Miyaguchi said she was stepping down (Margaux Nijkerk had the news). And, Sam Reynolds explained on how investors in Mainland China may soon be able to get access to bitcoin. All these stories looked likely to run into next week’s coverage as crypto continues to provide plenty to write about. Stayed tuned for our continuing reporting.

Picture taken on day one event closure There’s a markedly more professional vibe to ETHDenver this year, founder of Yap Global and ETHDenver’s official PR partner Samantha Yap told me. “ETHDenver in its earlier years was more scrappy. This year, booths are spending a lot more money and there’s a greater professionalization of the event. The industry is evolving,” Yap said.

Unlike last year , where EigenLayer and restaking dominated the agenda, there’s pretty much a sprinkle of anything you could think of: DePIN, AI agents, regulation, RWAs, privacy and — of course — interoperability. Ethereum loves interop . Conferences are often chock-full of panels and fireside chats, speakers armed with their sometimes dreary PR-approved speeches. Standing out on the day one agenda was a spicy debate between Haseeb Qureshi from Dragonfly Capital and Matt O’Connor at Legion, on the topic of ICOs vs. venture capital funding. Legion is an ICO-like fundraising platform. Debate: ICOs Are Better Than VC Funding by: – @mattyTokenomics from @legiondotcc – @hosseeb from @dragonfly_xyz – @AshleyStanhope from Hardfork Media Full video below 👇🧵 pic.twitter.com/QiMLqWpAsm — ETHDenver 🏔🦬🦄 (@EthereumDenver) February 27, 2025 Matt: “The idea that VCs are catalyzing growth and the product’s purpose to begin with…this gatekeeping and holier-than-thou attitude of VCs knowing which projects to fund leads to less experimentation and variety of what’s backed.” Haseeb: “It’s rich since Legion raised money from VCs…and how many individual users using Legion own equity in Legion? I’m going to assume the number is zero.” Anyway, here are some key launches from yesterday: MetaMask is launching Bitcoin and Solana integrations, gas abstraction, a UX overhaul, smart transactions and a MetaMask card. 14 teams, including NEAR AI, Coinbase Agent Kit and Eliza Labs announced the Open Agents Alliance (OAA), an initiative to provide permissionless and free AI access globally by combining infrastructure. Uniswap announced fiat off-ramping on the Uniswap Wallet powered by Transak, Moonpay and Robinhood. BitLayer announced the BitVM Bridge, enabling trust-minimized bridging between the Bitcoin network and other chains like Base, Starknet, Arbitrum, Sonic and Plume. Babylon and digital asset insurance broker Native are developing institutional-grade insurance coverage for bitcoin stakers, enabling bitcoin slashing coverage denominated in BTC.

The steepest February drop was in 2014, when Bitcoin lost 30% of its value following the collapse of once-dominant exchange Mt. Gox. Bitcoin’s recent decline, which is currently trading just above $80,000 after briefly dropping below $79,000 in the past 24 hours, is attributed to a lack of bullish catalysts, according to Coinbase analysts. “In our view, the pullback was driven by the absence of positive near-term catalysts for the area combined with the lack of technical support between $80,000 and $95,000,” Coinbase analysts David Han and David Duong wrote in a report.

While Bitcoin struggled, global stock markets remained resilient thanks to continued strength in the AI sector. Nvidia’s fourth-quarter earnings report on Feb. 26 topped expectations, reinforcing investors’ confidence in AI-driven growth. Meanwhile, gold maintained its upward momentum, supported by central bank purchases. The Coinbase report also pointed to weakening macroeconomic sentiment in the U.S. Key indicators, including a 10% month-over-month decline in the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index and a 7% drop in the Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index, added to concerns about an economic slowdown, weighing on risk assets including cryptocurrencies. Reflecting the cautious market sentiment, institutional investors pulled more than $2.9 billion from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs last week, analysts said, while the lending market also showed a risk-off trend as leverage was reduced and funding rates fell. *This is not investment advice.

At the time of writing, the coin has breached the resistance level at $84,000 as investors digest the United States Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data. As an important inflationary gauge, the PCE data has signaled that inflation is not much of a concern as investors react to it. Bitcoin Price and PCE Influence According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the PCE Price Index for January increased by 2.5% year-on-year (YoY). As a complement, the Core PCE Price Index (besides food and energy) jumped by 2.6% YoY. Despite the minor inflationary outlook, the readings are not far from projections before the release. The inflation readings are down compared to the Core PCE Index of 2.9% recorded in December. From December to January, the data showed that inflation climbed by just 0.3%, which aligns with expectations. These PCE Index readings have calmed the storm after intense macroeconomic turmoil fueled the Bitcoin price slump. The figures show a slight slowdown in inflation. However, the Federal Reserve still has work to do. The reading is still far from the 2% annual reading it always targets, so it might need to revise its interest rate policies . BTC Price and the $90,000 Play At the time of writing, the price of Bitcoin was changing hands for $84,171.62, down by 0.41% in 24 hours. Over this period, the coin dropped from a low of $78,248.91 to a high of $84,938.65 before correcting slightly to its current level. An earlier BTC price analysis shows that the coin was bracing up for a drop to $75,000 after it dropped below $80,000 on February 27. The unexpected rebound has triggered new sentiment around the coin, with analysts debating whether the coin has reached the bottom. Price Price Chart. Source: TradingView Currently, the BTC/USD 4H chart shows that the coin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is pegged at 41.94. However, it dropped as low as 18.64 hours ago, a sign of how oversold it is. With this rebound, chances are high the coin may reclaim its highest level at $90,000 soon. Rebound Catalysts Are Evident Amid the market rout, the potential for Bitcoin price rebound remains very high. As reported earlier by CoinGape, BlackRock added Bitcoin ETF to its model portfolios, a sign of improvement in sentiment. Top institutional buyers like MicroStrategy also remain keen on HODLing, solidifying the demand base for the coin. With analysts claiming that the retracement is normal in a bull cycle, whether the BTC price will cross the $90,000 level in the coming days remains to be seen.

The new contracts will be cash-settled and based on the CME Solana-Dollar Reference Rate, which calculates the daily U.S. dollar value of Solana. Traders will have the option to choose between a micro contract (25 SOL) and a standard contract (500 SOL). Giovanni Vicioso, global head of cryptocurrency products at CME Group, stated in the press release that the launch of SOL futures is a response to the rising demand for regulated cryptocurrency trading options. He emphasized that as Solana grows in adoption, the new futures contracts will offer an efficient way for investors to manage risk and develop their strategies. This announcement confirms the timeline for SOL futures, following a leak from CME Group’s beta website in January. You might also like: CME could launch SOL and XRP futures on Feb. 10 Solana futures add to growing institutional interest The introduction of Solana futures marks another step in the institutionalization of digital assets. CME Group already offers Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) futures, and its crypto derivatives market is seeing increased activity. According to CME Group, average daily volume in its crypto futures market has risen 73% year over year, with 202,000 contracts traded daily. Open interest has also grown 55%, signaling increasing demand for regulated crypto investment products. Teddy Fusaro, president of Bitwise Asset Management, noted that CME Group’s introduction of SOL futures demonstrates its commitment to providing advanced trading and risk management tools for institutional investors and active traders. Kyle Samani, co-founder of Multicoin Capital, praised CME Group for advancing crypto derivatives. In the press release, he stated that SOL futures align with the growing demand for better trading tools. He noted that as digital assets mature, investors require more efficient mechanisms to gain exposure and manage volatility. These futures contracts, he added, address that need by offering flexibility with reduced upfront costs. The launch of Solana futures is still subject to regulatory approval and would be listed under CME Group’s existing trading framework, offering a structured, regulated alternative to direct Solana investments. CME Group’s expansion into Solana futures reflects growing confidence in digital asset markets. If demand follows the trajectory of Bitcoin and Ethereum futures, Solana’s presence in institutional finance could see further growth.

Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) has commented on the bearish market sentiment witnessed in the crypto industry. CZ reminded investors that market dips and corrections are part of free markets. CZ cautions stressed investors to reduce their crypto positions Dips are a part of free markets. 🤷‍♂️ Not financial advice. If you are stressed about it, you probably should reduce your investment size. (That is, if you view crypto as an investment.) For me, it's a worldview shift. I exited the old world 11 years ago. https://t.co/5zzRAMB4YC — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) February 28, 2025 Although he categorically stated that he wasn’t giving financial advice, he urged investors who view crypto as an investment vehicle to reduce their positions in digital assets if they feel stressed and overwhelmed about the existing market conditions. He explained that he views crypto as a worldview shift and that he exited the world eleven years ago. CZ was replying to a question from one of his followers who was seeking words to heal the X crypto timeline as the crypto market continues to display tough conditions for both traders and investors. The follower asked what the Binance founder had to say about the current market condition. The crypto market has been on a sharp decline in recent weeks following uncertainties revolving around economic policies under President Trump’s administration. Top crypto projects have shed nearly all the gains they had recorded after Donald Trump won the 2024 presidential elections. Trump’s victory sparked a wave of excitement, causing both retail and institutional investors to join the crypto bandwagon. Trump had publicly endorsed the crypto industry, promising several regulatory developments to foster the industry’s growth. Trump has already made a few steps toward promoting the industry. He appointed pro-crypto candidates such as Howard Lutnick and David Sacks, who now hold senior government positions, to help enforce pro-crypto-friendly regulations. Trump also signed an executive order involving a review of establishing a digital asset reserve for the U.S. Treasury. Bitcoin tumbles by 26% from its ATH price Despite the developments, the crypto market continues to exhibit a bearish sentiment. Bitcoin, the world’s largest crypto asset by market capitalization, is down 26% from its all-time high price of $109,114 registered on January 20th. The crypto asset retails at $80,635 at the time of this publication. Trump launched his memecoin days before his inauguration called OFFICIAL TRUMP. According to CoinMarketCap data, the memecoin is down 84% from a January peak and currently retails at $11. Crypto prices are also facing headwinds from more hawkish monetary policy and Trump’s threat of tariffs. The market recently plunged after Trump confirmed tariffs on Mexico and Canada. U.S. spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have also witnessed massive outflows in the last few days. Blockchain analysis platform Onchain Lens reported that BlackRock’s Bitcoin investment firm iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) deposited 5,100 $BTC worth $441 million and 30,280 $ETH worth $71.85 million on the full-service prime institutional brokerage platform. The transactions caused discussions on whether the Fund was selling the digital assets, managing liquidity, or executing a strategic shift. Spot Bitcoin ETF outflows continue amid bearish market sentiment. According to data from Sosovalue, IBIT registered outflows worth $189.02 million on 27th February. The figures mirror a continuing trend of outflows from the ETF market. Yesterday, the spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds witnessed outflows worth $275 million, marking an 8-day streak of negative flows. The total net assets under ETF management have dropped below the $100 billion mark and currently sits at $94.3 billion at the time of this publication. The figure represents 5.69% of Bitcoin’s market capitalization. Long-term crypto advocates have stepped forward to express their opinions on the future of crypto. Besides CZ, the Founder and CEO of Professional Capital Management, Anthony Pompliano, said in an interview that Bitcoin is likely to be 10X after the ongoing correction. Like CZ, the crypto asset has periodically recorded massive corrections during its bull cycles. Pompliano said he doesn’t have a clear price on Bitcoin’s imminent upsurge. However, he explained his positive outlook based on the asset’s historical performance. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Tron historic price sentiment TRON price history Tron, founded by Justin Sun in 2017, raised $70 million through an ICO the same year; it launched its mainnet in May 2018 and migrated TRX from Ethereum to Tron in June, which temporarily boosted TRX’s price to $0.09. TRX reached an all-time high of $0.3004 in January 2018 before dropping below $0.05 a month later; it consistently traded under $0.05 until late 2020, when it began to rise again. In 2021, it reached a high of $0.16. Tron was also reorganized as a DAO as Justin stepped down as CEO of Tron Foundation. TRX was in a bear trend for the best part of 2022. In 2023, TRX maintained a consistent bull run, rising from a low of $0.05. In March 2023, the SEC sued Justin for allegedly selling unregistered securities and promoting Tron and Bittorent tokens. In February 2024, Circle’s announcement to cease USDC on Tron led TRX to correct from $0.1429. TRX held above $0.1234 until mid-May, then dropped to $0.1113. The price rebounded to $0.1398 in July but fell again to $0.1213 in early August. By late September, TRX recovered to $0.166, reaching $0.1691 in October and touching $0.2130 in late November. TRX ended 2024 with a price tag of $0.255. Tron was priced at $0.255 at the start of January 2025 and is trading in a range of $0.204 to $0.257 in February.",Crypto Price Predictions|TRON,EN,0,0,MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|TRADING|TRX|ICO|EXCHANGE|BNB|LINK|ASIA|USDT|USDD,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-28 18:12:48

CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju tells his 409,400 followers on the social media platform X that he expects severe corrections during bull cycles and that Bitcoin may soon return to six figures. However, he warns that if Bitcoin drops well below $75,000, it will likely mark the end of the current bull market cycle. “I’m bullish. The bull cycle is not over. The cycle I’m referring to includes a potential 30% drawdown at some point. If the price drops significantly below $75,000, I’d be wrong. I didn’t change my stance. I’ve been consistent about the bull cycle and the possibility of a 30% correction.” He also believes that Bitcoin may remain in the consolidation phase for a while longer based on the spot trading volume metric, similar to a pattern in early 2024, before possibly breaking through the range high of about $100,000. “Bitcoin spot volume was highly active around $100,000. In the distribution phases, prices drop when new liquidity dries up. The key question regarding whether the BTC market will face years of bear markets is: Where will fresh liquidity come from? We’ll likely see an extended consolidation in the wide range (e.g., $75,000-$100,000), similar to early 2024, in my opinion. This could last until some good news for Bitcoin brings in new liquidity.” Source: Ki Young Ju/X Bitcoin is trading for $84,247 at time of writing, down 22.1% from its all-time high of $108,786, which it hit on January 20th.

The rumours emanated from users who saw Arkham Intelligence’s report on February 24 that showed Binance transferred roughly 103,570 SOL and 25,000 ETH to the market maker Wintermute. The transactions from Binance also coincided with a significant market crash on February 25, which fuelled FUD among investors. Crypto analysts like Marty Party and Jacob King alleged that the cryptocurrency exchange was selling off its Solana and Ethereum holdings for various reasons. The digital asset exchange argued that its market surveillance program, designed to detect and prevent market manipulation, ensured a fair trading environment for all users. The firm also maintained there was no conclusive evidence to support the claims, and the rumours seemed to stem from misinterpretation of the data. Binance refutes rumours of selling Solana amid market crash JUST IN: #Binance denies claims of dumping $ETH and $SOL on Wintermute. pic.twitter.com/J1ZGsAbImz — MrRebel.eth (@rebelethpromos) February 27, 2025 Crypto analyst Marty Party had alleged that Binance was dumping its Solana for various reasons. Founder and CEO of Whale Wire, Jacob King, also referred to transaction receipts from Binance and alleged that the firm was mass dumping Ethereum. The rumours were also fueled by the February 25 market crash, which saw Bitcoin plummet below $90,000, leading to over $1 billion in liquidations. Binance addressed the speculation on February 26 and denied the rumours on social media of selling Solana and Ethereum holdings. The crypto exchange argued that it only functions as a marketplace that facilitates transactions, with no control over users’ trading decisions, including those of market makers. “Binance hasn’t dumped or sold large amounts of tokens as some tweets have misunderstood. As an exchange, we simply help users match trades and we have no visibility into our users’ decisions, including market makers who may move their assets according to their strategies.” – Binance Customer Support . The cryptocurrency exchange urged users against drawing conclusions based on transaction screenshots. Arkham Intelligence revealed data on Feb 24 that showed market makers made significant transactions from Binance hot wallets. The market maker Wintermute withdrew over 100,000 SOL ($16.32 million) and 25,000 ETH ($80 million) from Binance. Binance says transactions from market makers were for liquidity support Crypto analyst Solid Intel highlighted that the withdrawals were due to the market maker removing liquidity or buying SOL from the order books. The withdrawals also happened days ahead of Solana’s $2 billion token unlock, which is scheduled to release over 11.2 million SOL tokens into circulation on March 1. The company said the transactions caused speculations that it was selling its token holdings in over-the-counter (OTC) trades. Binance acknowledged that similar market makers operate based on their own strategies unrelated to the world’s largest exchange. The firm highlighted the importance of recognizing trading strategies that could be misinterpreted as market manipulation. Binance stated that users should “learn to recognize FUD” and also encouraged the community to learn more about what market makers do. Market makers work to provide liquidity in the crypto market by placing buy and sell orders, which tighten bid-ask spreads and enable smoother trading activities. The market makers play a crucial role in absorbing large orders, reducing price volatility, and contributing to market stability. Binance argued that exchanges often partner with market makers by providing them with tokens as incentives to continuously boost their inventory. The crypto exchange highlighted that despite blockchain’s transparency, it was important not to jump to conclusions about screenshots of transactions. Binance also encouraged the community to fully understand more about the role of an exchange as they always encourage users to do their own research. Crypto analyst Artchick.eth also iterated that $7.5 billion of Solana unlocks was coming over the next three months. The analyst also said the majority of the SOL was purchased from FTX auctions at $64 by Galaxy Digital, Pantera Capital, and Figure. Crypto trader RunnerXBT argued that it was a “dangerous” time to purchase Solana. The trader highlighted that Galaxy Digital, Pantera Capital and Figure would gain $3 billion, $1 billion, and $150 million, respectively, in unrealized profits once their SOL was unlocked.

Get the Full Details!,https://bitzo.com/2025/02/bitcoin-btc-ethereum-eth-global-downtrend-or-pre-ath-correction-get-the-full-details,"Bitcoin and Ethereum have been experiencing significant market movements recently. Analysts are debating whether this is a market downturn or just a phase before hitting new all-time highs. This article explores the current trends to determine the future potential for these leading cryptocurrencies. Discover which coins might be poised for a surge and get the full details inside. Bitcoin's Mixed Signals: Short-Term Dip Amid Long-Term Growth Trends Last month saw a sharp drop nearing 22 percent while the week fell about 19.5 percent. Over the last six months, Bitcoin rebounded by 34.2 percent. The past performance shows short-term drops against a backdrop of longer-term recovery. Price activity last month was volatile, indicating quick corrections despite the overall upward trend in the half-year period. Current trading occurs within a range from roughly 91,573 to 111,487 dollars. The nearest resistance is about 120,357 dollars, with support near 80,528 dollars and a deeper floor at 60,614 dollars. Bears have pushed prices lower recently, yet oversold signals and the overall recovery point to potential buys within these levels. Trading ideas might focus on accumulation near the support levels and careful positioning for a bounce. Ethereum Analysis: Bearish Momentum with Key Support and Resistance Levels Ethereum has faced significant downturns, experiencing a sharp decline of nearly 32 percent in the past month and about 16 percent over the last six months. A notable drop of over 23 percent in just one week underscores the recent rapid losses. These price movements indicate persistent downward pressure, with attempts at recovery frequently failing. Short-term corrections highlight an overall downtrend, prompting cautious sentiment among traders. Currently, Ethereum is trading within a range of approximately 2900 to 3720 dollars. Immediate support is found around 2508 dollars, while a stronger support level lies closer to 1691 dollars. Resistance is identified near 4141 dollars and 4957 dollars. The prevailing negative momentum and a 26 RSI indicate that bears are in control, leading traders to consider bounce plays from support levels or short strategies if prices fail to surpass resistance. Conclusion BTC and ETH have both shown significant pullbacks recently. This could indicate either a short-term correction before reaching new highs or a prolonged downtrend. Historical data and market sentiment will play crucial roles in determining their future paths. Investors must pay attention to market signals and key indicators.

Analyst Says “The Worst is Behind Us”, Shares Expectations",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/what-will-march-look-like-for-bitcoin-analyst-says-the-worst-is-behind-us-shares-expectations/,"According to some analysts, the cryptocurrency market is expected to recover in March as macroeconomic conditions show signs of improvement. Bitcoin prices have seen a recovery amid the recent release of Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data, fueling optimism that the broader economic environment will ease next month. Julien Bittel, director of macro research at Global Macro Investor, highlighted the role of financial conditions in shaping market trends: “When financial conditions tighten, liquidity decreases and economic surprises start to slow down. But the panic that has gripped the market will not last long. A reversal is likely next month.” Over the past two months, key financial indicators have shifted in favor of riskier assets. The U.S. dollar has weakened, bond yields have fallen, and oil prices have fallen, all of which have set the stage for a potential rally in the cryptocurrency market. Financial conditions are a leading indicator, Bittel said, suggesting the worst may already be priced in.

This has led to liquidity shortages and increased concerns about a potential recession. However, financial conditions are easing rapidly and this should translate into better economic data soon.” Bitcoin, which recently dropped to around $80,000, appears to have fully absorbed the impact of the financial tightening, according to Bittel. While further downside risk is possible, he noted that sentiment is already extremely bearish, with Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) at its most oversold level since August 23, 2023. *This is not investment advice.

The football icon’s past alleged involvement in the “18kRonaldinho” crypto scam, which supposedly defrauded investors of over $60 million, adds skepticism to his latest announcement. ‘Keep an Eye for Fake Meme Coins’ The meme coin sector has been one of the highlights of the last bull cycle in the cryptocurrency market. Contrary to their potential to chart impressive gains in a short period of time , though, these assets remain quite dangerous due to their dubious use cases and enhanced volatility. Interestingly, the latest warning on the matter came from the Brazilian football icon Ronaldo de Assis Moreira (better known as Ronaldinho). He used his official X account to alert people about fake meme coins with his name. The Ballon d’Or winner for 2005 claimed that he hasn’t launched any official tokens. At the same time, though, he hyped the community with incoming “big news:” “For the entire crypto community: stay tuned because very soon we will have big news here!” His disclosure triggered mixed reactions from some well-known names in the industry. The popular analyst Michael van de Poppe suggested that the “big news” could be that Ronalndinho had purchased Bitcoin (BTC) instead of introducing his own meme coin. Others assumed that the former football player would launch a disputable, extremely centralized project that would eventually scam millions of people. The crypto community has witnessed the birth of countless celebrity-endorsed meme coins in the past several months, many of which have disappointed investors sooner or later. Some examples include Official Trump (TRUMP), Daddy Tate (DADDY), Mother Iggy (MOTHER), and others. Ronaldinho’s Previous Crypto Affairs The Brazilian is not a newbie in the cryptocurrency industry , jumping on the bandwagon approximately three years ago. Back then, he shook hands with Graph Blockchain’s subsidiary, New World Inc., to become an ambassador of the organization and introduce NFT experiences to his numerous fans. A year later, the Brazilian authorities launched an investigation against Ronaldinho for his alleged involvement in a crypto scam called “18kRonaldinho” that pocketed over $60 million from victims. The football legend denied any partnership with the entity, claiming his image was used without authorization. He maintained that he was also a victim of the scheme.

Why this Altcoin could Rise higher than SHIB Before June 2025,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bigger-roi-potential-than-shiba-inu-why-this-altcoin-could-rise-higher-than-shib-before-june-2025/,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) last week stunned with a 2,004.92% spike in its burn rate, following calls for a 1,200% price blast. This surge, however, is speculative supply shocks rather than real utility in the real world. Give a warm welcome to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a decentralized lending protocol whose presale has already taken $1.8 million from 3,400 investors. At $0.015 in its second presale stage, MUTM’s tokenomics and real-world financial utility place it not only to compete with SHIB’s growth but even outdo it. With a 400% profit assured at its $0.06 listing on an exchange and expectations set to rise to $3.50 on launch, this altcoin is becoming fast to invest in as a draw for moderate, high-reward trades. Mutuum Finance Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance ‘s second presale round is in high gear as speculators rush to purchase tokens before the forthcoming price surge. Early birds who invested at $0.015 can realize a 33.3% return when phase three launches at $0.02. This is fueled by the project’s open tokenomics: a $0.06 listing price at launch will provide a four times return, equivalent to $6,000 on every $1,500 invested. In addition to presale gains, experts forecast a post-listing frenzy to $3.50; a 23,233% premium to current levels. Those figures are well ahead of SHIB’s hype-driven 1,200% estimate, basing MUTM’s appeal on measurable factors rather than hype-driven fluctuations. The platform’s speed in raising funds; $1.8 million in weeks; matches growing faith in its decentralized lending idea. Unlike SHIB, which employs token burns to create artificially induced pressure on price, Mutuum Finance incorporates demand into the structure through utility. Its ecosystem allows users to lend assets, borrow collateral, and earn passive income, creating natural buy pressure. The longer the presale goes on, the shorter the window is to buy the tokens at the lowest possible price, and that incentivizes late movers to move fast. Demand driving is Mutuum’s distribute-and-buy function. Part on-platform revenue buy MUTM tokens directly from the market and redistribute them to mtToken stakers. This puts the token in constant buying pressure, making its price always appreciate and rewarding holders in the long term. SHIB human burns are not comparable; MUTM demand is organic to its design. Strategic Incentives and Market Positioning Mutuum Finance positions itself more attractively with a $100,000 giveaway, and ten early buyers each get $10,000. Not only does this drive participation but also incentivizes greater presale engagement. By comparison, SHIB community efforts lack formal incentives, with growth depending on market sentiment. Its project plan will include a feature of peer-to-peer lending where there would be point-to-point haggling in something like SHIB or DOGE; an extension to its ambit. In the future, other overcollateralized stablecoins are also in the works, which brings even more integration into the system with onboarding risk-neutral investors. Aside from audited smart contracts and dynamic interest, Mutuum Finance offers security with flexibility that positions it at DeFi default and not something to do today but leave behind tomorrow. While the crypto economy has grown up, utility-based projects are now outselling speculation-based peers. Presale success with Mutuum Finance and its novel lending model highlights its capacity to harvest returns much larger than those of SHIB’s hype rallies. Time’s running out; phase two is not going to last forever, nor will $0.015. Get on board before the next rally.

FXGuys ICO Presale Sees Record Investor Interest,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/pepe-price-drop-incoming-fxguys-ico-presale-sees-record-investor-interest/,"The crypto market is heating up, and of course, not all tokens are thriving. Pepe (PEPE), one of the best meme coins, faces bearish signals, leading investors to reconsider their positions. Meanwhile, the FXGuys ($FXG) ICO presale is ongoing and drawing massive attention, with early investors seeing it as a chance for huge returns this year. With the PEPE price struggling to hold its ground and the FX Guys ICO presale surging in popularity, which one offers the best cryptocurrency investment opportunity? Let’s find out! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Traders Brace For A Downturn as PEPE Price Struggles Among Other Meme Coins The PEPE price is currently at $0.0000088 , down more than 7% over the past week. Among other meme coins, the PEPE price has seen a 40% decrease in the past month, showing signs of weakening momentum. Trading volume has also declined, and the hype that once propelled the PEPE price to new highs is fading. A major factor behind the recent PEPE price drop is the decrease in whale accumulation. Data shows that large holders have been offloading PEPE , signaling a potential sell-off. Without strong buying pressure, analysts warn that PEPE price could retrace further, possibly dipping in the coming days. Another issue affecting the PEPE price is the lack of ecosystem development. Unlike meme coins that have become utility-driven projects, PEPE remains primarily hype-driven. If bearish sentiment continues, traders may look for stronger alternatives, like $FXG, which is currently in its ICO presale. The FXGuys ICO Presale is Drawing Massive Investor Interest!

The new Solana futures will be cash-settled and available in two contract sizes: standard contracts of 500 SOL and micro contracts of 25 SOL. This will provide market participants with increased flexibility to hedge and manage risk associated with the price volatility of Solana's native cryptocurrency. Industry analysts view the addition of Solana futures as a significant step toward broader institutional adoption of Solana. The move may also enhance prospects for the approval of Solana-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the future, aligning with the growing interest in diversified cryptocurrency investment products.

XRP whales are now making bold moves as market sentiment shifts, fueling optimism around its price action. Meanwhile, Rollblock’s viral GameFi presale has captured investors' attention, attracting major bids from XRP and Cardano holders eager to capitalize on its rising potential. XRP Whales Show Interest in Rollblock (RBLK) Amid Market Downturn Rollblock (RBLK) is transforming the Web3 gaming industry using blockchain technology. The project has already secured over $10.7 million in presale inflows, proving strong investor confidence in its capability to disrupt the $500 billion online gaming industry. The explosive growth has contributed to a surge in new user signups, deposits, and wagered bids. With a massive selection of over 7,000 classic games, including poker, blackjack, and slot machines, Rollblock offers a next-level gaming experience. Its innovative sports prediction league further expands its appeal, setting a new benchmark for blockchain-powered gaming platforms. Transparency and security distinguish Rollblock from traditional online gaming platforms. Every bid and payout is encrypted and recorded on the Ethereum blockchain, eliminating any possibility of manipulation and ensuring fairness for all players. The RBLK token features a deflationary revenue-sharing model designed to maximize investor returns. Rollblock dedicates up to 30% of its revenue to RBLK buybacks, permanently burning 60% of these tokens to reduce the circulating supply. The remaining 40% funds staking rewards, offering long-term holders returns of up to 30% APY. This structure not only strengthens long-term price appreciation but also rewards dedicated investors. Stage 10 tokens are selling fast at $0.06, and major exchange listings are just around the corner. The excitement surrounding Rollblock is at an all-time high, creating a prime opportunity for investors. A limited-time 50% bonus on all RBLK purchases before March makes now the perfect time to secure an early position before prices climb higher. XRP’s Unexpected Price Shift After Latest Upgrade to XRP Ledger XRP's market pattern has shown unexpected shifts, disregarding its traditional price movement patterns and generating unpredictable prospects for its future. EGRAR CRYPTO on X discussed an ascending triangle pattern on the XRP chart, which usually leads to upward price movements in 70% of similar situations. However, XRP disrupted market expectations this time by charting downward instead of maintaining its anticipated pattern, demonstrating current market volatility. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has identified that XRP whales conducted a 370 million token sale in 96 hours . The large-scale selling activities have intensified market pressure, contributing to XRP's recent price deterioration. XRP sells at $2.2, with a 0.73% upward shift in the last 24 hours. The token has experienced a 17.29% drop in value over the past seven days. Despite market uncertainty, the token maintains a high daily trading volume of $6 billion. Source: TradingView Meanwhile, Ripple reached a significant partnership arrangement with Korean custody company BDACS. BDACS collaboration advances the Financial Services Commission’s (FSC) evolving regulations, which target institutional investors to participate in Korea’s digital asset market. The partnership creates opportunities to increase XRP’s usage as it strengthens its role in the developing digital finance industry. Analyst Predicts a 2,757% Surge for Cardano (ADA) Cardano is trading at $0.77 , up 1.18% in the last 24 hours. The token has experienced considerable losses, with a 14.46% drop during the past week and a 30% decline over the previous month. Cardano remains below $1, but investors maintain positive outlooks regarding its future performance. Source: TradingView Crypto analyst Sssebi made a bold forecast this month, predicting a massive 2,757% rally that could propel Cardano to $20. He outlined some key factors that could drive this surge. One of the biggest drivers for Cardano is the potential merger with Bitcoin, which generated an intense reaction from the Cardano community. Sssebi predicts this partnership will yield substantial positive effects on ADA’s market value. More importantly, the SEC’s potential decision to approve a Cardano ETF remains another significant driver of ADA's future market value. If approved, the ETF could activate institutional demand for the altcoin, and ADA could experience a major price rise. Sssebi also identified a potential strategic relationship between Cardano and Microsoft as one of the major elements driving ADA's future market growth. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson indicated a possible Cardano-Microsoft collaboration during his February 10 YouTube live broadcast. The proposed partnership between the companies can potentially deliver additional value to the ADA token price. Other analysts, including TapTools , share a similarly bullish outlook on ADA. TapTools predicts that Cardano is on track to retest its all-time high of $3, with a new record high within reach. With multiple bullish factors aligning, the future of Cardano looks increasingly promising. Rollblock (RBLK) Emerges as the Top Investment Pick of 2025 XRP and Cardano are still struggling to regain stability after a rough start to the year. In contrast, Rollblock (RBLK) is emerging as one of the best investment opportunities in 2025. Its presale has seen massive adoption with over $10.7 million raised and RBLK has surged by over 450%. This rapid growth gives it a clear edge over slower-moving assets in the market, and projections show RBLK will hit over 100x post-launch.

On February 28, 2025, following the opening bell of the U.S. market, most assets began experiencing a price rebound.

The 46-year-old faced charges related to running crypto ATMs through his company, GidiPlus, with machines installed at multiple locations across the UK. According to authorities, Osunkoya set up a £2.5 million ($3.2 million) crypto ATM business despite being denied registration by the Financial Conduct Authority. The FCA filed charges against him in early September 2024, and he pleaded guilty to six counts on September 30, 2024. On Feb. 28, the court convicted him of unregistered crypto activity, forgery, possession and use of false identity documents, and criminal property possession.

The FCA noted that he made significant profits, charging markup fees between 30% and 60% on transactions. “Your decision to continue to operate illegally was an act of deliberate and calculated defiance to the regulator,” His Honour Judge Perrins said during sentencing. The judge further noted that Osunkoya went to “great lengths to create a false identity,” making his case more than a mere regulatory breach. “This is the UK’s first criminal sentencing for unregistered crypto activity and sends a clear message: those who flout our rules, seek to evade detection and engage in criminal activity will face serious consequences,” said Therese Chambers, executive director of enforcement at the FCA. Osunkoya’s guilty sentence comes as the FCA looks to intensify its crackdown on illegal crypto related operations and services. The financial markets watchdog mandates all providers seeking to offer digital asset services and products in the country to register. FCA also requires that providers adhere to anti-money laundering guidelines and checks, a fact the agency says the crypto ATM provider failed to comply with. Per the markets regulator, its crackdown on illegal crypto teller machines saw the number of UK crypto ATM locations on CoinATMRadar fall from 80 in 2022 to zero in 2024. Details on the CoinATMRadar website shows there are currently over 37,200 crypto ATMs in 69 countries.

The incident fuels calls for stronger key management and proactive monitoring systems. There’s growing momentum for decentralized solutions to mitigate systemic crypto risks. The debate hints at upcoming shifts in both technical safeguards and regulatory oversight. At ETHDenver, held in late February 2025, discussions prominently focused on the recent $1.5 billion Bybit hack. The breach, occurring earlier in the month, was attributed to vulnerabilities within Safe wallet infrastructure rather than Bybit’s internal systems. In response, Bybit released a forensic review confirming their internal security remained intact, pinpointing compromised Safe wallet infrastructure as the cause. the $1.4B bybit hack has lead to about $4.3B in value leaving the crypto ecosystem ….cool — Crypto Texan | Polygon | ETH DENVER (@Crypto_Texan) February 27, 2025 Cryptonews interviewed industry experts at ETHDenver to explore how this hack could have been prevented and assess its wider implications for crypto security. The Role of Centralized Services in Crypto Security Kai Wawrzinek, co-founder of Impossible Cloud Network , believes the hack highlights the risks associated with relying on centralized cloud services. “While certainly not the main cause of Bybit’s record hack, compromised credentials at Amazon Web Services (AWS) certainly played a role and underline the many issues that accompany overreliance on centralized services, especially cloud services when it comes to these kinds of advanced hacks,” said Wawrzinek. “Indeed, centralized infrastructure (in this case AWS) negates many of the benefits of decentralization of the Safe Wallet,” said Wawrzinek. He added that the problem goes beyond Safe itself, highlighting an ongoing lack of understanding about decentralized solutions and the industry’s need to build trust in these alternatives. Wawrzinek also pointed out potential benefits of decentralized cloud solutions. “But now, there are decentralized cloud alternatives that remove that single point of failure risk, greatly reducing the possibility of a hack executed in this manner,” he said. Although he acknowledged no solution offers a complete guarantee, Wawrzinek emphasized that adopting decentralized cloud infrastructure is a critical step in combating hacks and exploits. Key Management Policies Under Scrutiny Oliver Gale, CEO and co-founder of Panther Protocol , argued that the hack resulted from poor key management policies rather than a fundamental flaw in centralized exchanges. “One can expect increasingly sophisticated attacks on crypto wallets, particularly those of high value. There is a balance to be struck between practical utility and security of funds, and it is shocking that in the case of Bybit, they didn’t use an air-gapped device when sending $1.4 billion worth of ETH,” said Gale. He also criticized Safe for failing to implement stricter security protocols. “It is inexcusable for ‘Safe’ to have allowed such a security lapse to undermine a critical infrastructure player in crypto. As far as we have come, there’s a long way to go,” he added. Gale believes centralized exchanges need to allocate more resources toward security proactively. “This isn’t a centralized exchange flaw but rather a flaw in key management policies. Centralized exchanges should spend a percentage of their revenue quarterly on security systems—treat it like an insurance policy. Bybit has damaged its liquidity due to an exodus of capital from their venue. However, the CEO’s transparent disaster management, ongoing service of withdrawals, and commitment to cover losses mean they should survive this long-term,” said Gale. Decentralized Storage Mitigates Impact of Hacks Phil Mataras, founder of decentralized data storage network AR.IO , emphasized the importance of decentralized, tamper-proof storage in mitigating hack impacts. “When these attacks happen, it highlights an important use case for permanent decentralized cloud storage, which creates a permanent record for data that is tamper-proof,” said Mataras. “On a blockchain like Arweave, the changes could be tracked, verified, sourced, and users could then ‘roll back’ to the version prior to when the hack occurred.” He explained further that although transactions from the hack itself can’t be reversed, restoring applications to their pre-hack state would effectively prevent additional malicious activity. Mataras suggested such a system would provide critical backup infrastructure for exchanges and wallets, helping mitigate security failures. Systemic Vulnerabilities in Centralized Exchanges Louis Bellet, lead architect at decentralized clearing network Yellow, told Cryptonews that there are fundamental risks posed by centralized exchanges, stating that Bybit’s hack is part of a larger security challenge in the industry. “The Bybit hack is a critical reminder of the vulnerabilities seen in centralized exchanges and how easily they are prone to failure,” said Bellet. “Regardless of the security measures advertised by these platforms, they still hold single points of failure while simultaneously asking for users’ trust—yet, when compromised, billions can be lost in moments.” He further emphasized that the Bybit hack illustrates not just a single event but a systemic issue affecting exchanges broadly. Bellet stressed that unless the industry adopts better security standards, hacks like Bybit’s will continue to threaten trust and liquidity in the market. What’s Next for Crypto Security? The Bybit hack has reignited discussions around best security practices, with experts agreeing decentralized solutions could offer a more robust alternative to centralized services. Whether through decentralized cloud storage, improved key management policies, or eliminating single points of failure, the industry faces critical choices. Yet, the broader crypto industry faces a critical juncture: will this latest breach finally lead to meaningful reforms in security practices, or will the cycle of reactionary measures continue, exposing users repeatedly to risk? How the sector responds in the coming months will determine not only the future of individual platforms like Bybit but the credibility of crypto markets as a whole. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How does the Bybit hack compare to other major cryptocurrency breaches? At $1.5 billion, Bybit’s breach ranks among history’s largest crypto hacks, surpassing the Ronin Bridge attack ($620M) and approaching Poly Network’s incident. Unlike previous code exploits, this targeted wallet infrastructure. What does this breach reveal about current crypto security? This breach exposes inherent weaknesses in centralized crypto security, revealing that even stringent protocols can fail due to human error. It highlights the need for decentralized systems and improved key controls. What regulatory changes might this hack accelerate? Expect stricter requirements including mandatory cold storage percentages, independent security audits, and proof-of-reserves attestations. Jurisdictions where Bybit operates may lead with new custody regulations.

Experts Call Hybrid Model the Next Big Thing After XRP’s Ledger,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/02/whats-driving-the-dtx-exchange-hype-experts-call-hybrid-model-the-next-big-thing-after-xrps-ledger,"In times of market uncertainty, traders gravitate toward innovation, seeking stability beyond traditional assets. As Bitcoin falters near $90,000 after Bybit’s $1.5 billion breach, traders seek ecosystems merging security with multi-asset agility. Enter hybrid platforms like DTX Exchange —bridging stocks, crypto, and forex under blockchain’s transparency—as analysts herald their potential to redefine post-ledger trading standards. Since the DTX Exchange will list at a higher price, investors have one last chance to get a 100% bonus on token purchases. By applying ""LIST2X"" at the checkout, buyers can double their DTX stack, getting a better position prior to the token's exchange listing, and 4x their investment instead of 2x from $0.18 to $0.36. This final presale stage provides a one-of-a-kind opportunity before DTX lists for trading. How DTX’s Innovative Approach is Redefining Exchange Standards Hybrid trading platforms are gaining momentum as traders seek unified access to traditional and digital markets. By integrating over 120,000 assets—including stocks, forex, and ETFs—into a single blockchain-powered interface, this new model eliminates the need for multiple accounts across fragmented platforms. Unlike legacy systems tied to niche markets, the approach prioritizes scalability, with transaction speeds exceeding 200,000 TPS to accommodate surging demand. The XRP price has struggled to regain its 2021 highs, partly due to Ripple’s narrower focus on cross-border payments. In contrast, platforms offering diversified asset classes and decentralized governance are capturing institutional interest. With 700,000+ holders already secured during its presale, the infrastructure supporting this shift emphasizes accessibility, allowing retail participants to trade global markets with minimal capital through fractional ownership. Transparency remains a cornerstone, as seen in non-custodial wallets and distributed liquidity pools that reduce reliance on centralized intermediaries. While the XRP price reflects Ripple’s ongoing regulatory adjustments, hybrid ecosystems avoid these hurdles by design. Traders gain exposure to equities and commodities alongside crypto, creating a frictionless bridge between conventional finance and decentralized innovation. Industry Experts Spotlight DTX’s Breakthrough Model Over Traditional Ledger Systems Analysts note that traditional ledgers, like those underpinning Ripple’s XRP price movements, face limitations in supporting multi-asset trading at scale. Layer-1 blockchains optimized for specific use cases—such as cross-border settlements—lack the flexibility to tokenize equities or ETFs. This gap has fueled interest in adaptive networks capable of merging liquidity across markets without compromising speed. A recent tweet from crypto strategist @CryptoWendy0 underscores the sentiment: “Hybrid platforms aren’t just a trend—they’re the future. Bridging Wall Street and crypto unlocks trillion-dollar opportunities traditional ledgers can’t touch.” Such insights align with presale metrics, where over $15 million raised signals confidence in ecosystems built for diversified portfolios. While the XRP price hovers around $2.30, down 18% monthly, projects emphasizing asset agility are outperforming niche tokens. Security audits and a no KYC framework further differentiate this model from Ripple’s institutional partnerships, which remain scrutinized. By decentralizing custody and leveraging blockchain’s immutability, users mitigate exposure to third-party vulnerabilities. The XRP price may stabilize as Ripple expands its payment solutions, but traders increasingly favor platforms offering stocks, ETFs, and 1000x leverage under one roof. DTX Exchange Sets a Bold New Vision Beyond XRP’s Legacy Ripple’s early success in streamlining cross-border payments set benchmarks, but its reliance on banking partnerships now contrasts with decentralized alternatives. The XRP price reflects these growing pains, dipping 9% weekly as competitors prioritize multi-chain interoperability. Meanwhile, tokenizing real-world assets has emerged as a priority for platforms aiming to onboard mainstream traders. Source: XRP Price, Weekly Chart, CoinMarketCap With a public presale priced at $0.18 and a $0.36 listing target, early adopters position themselves for a 2x growth tied to real-world utility. Over 475 million tokens—half already claimed—create scarcity dynamics absent in Ripple’s uncapped XRP supply. As the best new crypto to invest in, according to analysts, its roadmap includes features like copy trading and institutional-grade analytics, tools traditional ledgers lack. The XRP price trajectory highlights the challenges of single-use networks in a multi-asset era. By contrast, ecosystems designed for scalability and cross-market integration are poised to dominate. With listings on tier-1 exchanges pending, this new DeFi project could redefine value accretion, blending crypto’s disruptive potential with traditional finance’s stability. For traders seeking the top crypto to invest in, hybrid models offer a compelling evolution beyond legacy systems. Conclusion Hybrid models are poised to dominate as traders demand unified access to global markets. While Ripple contends with XRP price volatility, DTX Exchange ’s $15.1 million presale success and 700,000+ holders highlight confidence in its multi-asset ecosystem. DTX's final bonus round is here—use ""LIST2X"" to double your token holdings before the exchange listing at an improved price. This evolution warrants attention for those seeking platforms blending crypto agility with traditional finance’s stability. Explore how to participate in its vision via the links below.

The meme coin has dropped over 10%, struggling to maintain key support levels. February was a tough month for SHIB, with the price plunging nearly 30%. After reaching a high of $0.00001964, it tumbled to a low of $0.0000123. Currently, analysts warn that if the crucial $0.000012 support fails, SHIB could dip further to $0.0000094. The broader crypto market has also suffered, with bearish sentiment dominating. SHIB’s repeated downturns in February highlight persistent selling pressure. Despite minor recovery attempts, the asset remains volatile, leaving investors cautious. Shiba Inu Price Drops: Could a Crash to $0.0000094 Be Next? Crypto analyst Ali has recently shared his perspective on the Shiba Inu ($SHIB) price trend. According to his latest chart analysis, the meme coin could potentially find support at two key levels. These levels are $0.000012 and $0.00000094. Ali points out that these price points are significant based on previous market behavior. The first level, $0.000012, has been tested before and could provide a solid base for the coin’s price to rebound. The second level, $0.00000094, represents a more drastic drop but is another area where buying pressure may increase. Shiba Inu Price Faces Selling Pressure The Shiba Inu price is experiencing downward pressure due to the significant percentage of holders at a loss (58%) according to IntoTheBlock data . This high number of loss-making holders could lead to further selling, putting downward pressure on the price. Furthermore, the concentration of 74% of holdings among large investors suggests that price movements could be heavily influenced by a small group, potentially amplifying volatility. Additionally, a weak price correlation with Bitcoin (0.79) indicates that Shiba Inu is not moving in tandem with the broader crypto market, which may limit price recovery. Finally, the 0.32% decline in Telegram members suggests reduced market interest, which could also impact demand and ultimately affect the price negatively. SHIB Price Analysis As of the reporting time, the SHIB price is showing signs of stability, with minor fluctuations occurring within the range of $0.00001 to $0.00002. The price has been consolidating, and current market behavior indicates a cautious upward movement, with SHIB trading at around $0.00001396. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), is currently at 45.68 iniducating a neutral zone. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is showing mixed signals. The MACD line remains below the signal line, indicating a bearish outlook in the short term. The immediate support target for Shiba Inu price prediction is $0.00001, which is a strong support area. A drop below it may lead to further declines, The IImmediate resistance target $0.00001405 this level could serve as a short-term resistance point. A breakout above this level could lead to the next resistance target of $0.00002. Shiba Inu Price Chart: TradingView To sum up, the Shiba Inu price faces heightened risks due to selling pressure and weak market interest. If critical support levels break, a further price decline could occur, potentially reaching $0.0000094.

In a new statement, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is declaring that memecoins are officially not securities. As defined by the SEC’s statement, “A ‘meme coin’ is a type of crypto asset inspired by internet memes, characters, current events, or trends for which the promoter seeks to attract an enthusiastic online community to purchase the meme coin and engage in its trading.” The SEC says memecoins are more like collectibles and entertainment items than securities. According to the SEC, memecoins fail the Howey test, a litmus test for deciding whether or not something is a security. “First, meme coin purchasers are not making an investment in an enterprise. That is, their funds are not pooled together to be deployed by promoters or other third parties for developing the coin or a related enterprise. Second, any expectation of profits that meme coin purchasers have is not derived from the efforts of others. That is, the value of meme coins is derived from speculative trading and the collective sentiment of the market, like a collectible.” The SEC’s official statement echoes comments made by Commissioner Hester Peirce on memecoins earlier this month. “Just because something is out there and it’s popular does not mean that it will fit within the SEC jurisdiction. So I just caution people not to assume that there’s going to be an SEC regulatory backstop to everything…” The statement comes on the heels of an overhaul at the regulatory agency. In addition to the consolidation and creation of a new crypto task force, the Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit (CETU), just last week, the SEC has also dropped several high-profile investigations as February comes to a close, including inquiries into Coinbase , Robinhood , OpenSea and MetaMask .

Solana Price Update: Whales Move Millions as Market Reacts SOL has had some big price changes as investors keep an eye on the market. Right now, Solana is priced at around $140, with $5.31 billion traded in the last 24 hours. Even though its price has dropped recently, Solana remains a major player in the crypto world, with a market value of $70.09 billion. However, whale activity is shaking things up; over $40 million worth of SOL was recently withdrawn from Binance, sparking speculation about future price movements. Source: CoinMarketcap Weekly Chart: Solana Price The Solana price has seen sharp swings, recently dropping 21.45% after failing to hold the $180 level. Analysts highlight key support levels at $135 and $120, with resistance near $150-$160. If SOL reclaims $150 as support, a rebound could be on the horizon. However, a break below $120 might signal further bearish momentum. As the market remains volatile, all eyes are on Solana price and SOL’s next move, while DTX continues gaining momentum as the next big crypto contender. Conclusion With Solana prices soaring and whales making bold moves, the crypto market is trending with action.

Chainalysis notes in its annual Crypto Crime Report that 2024’s total is currently less than the $46.1 billion worth of crypto that flowed into illicit addresses in 2023. The firm also says, however, that 2024’s total volume will likely exceed 2023’s as additional illicit addresses are identified. “Since 2020, our annual estimates of illicit activity — which include both evidentiary attributions and Chainalysis Signals data — have grown by an average of 25% between annual reporting periods. Assuming a similar growth rate between now and next year’s Crypto Crime Report, our annual totals for 2024 could surpass the $51 billion threshold.” The illicit total represented 0.14% of the total on-chain transaction volume last year. Chainalysis notes that stablecoins represent 63% of all illicit transactions, while Bitcoin ( BTC ) is the top choice of asset for ransomware and darknet market (DNM) sales. The privacy coin Monero ( XMR ) has also become an “increasingly important” part of DNM sales. The firm says the online marketplace Huione Guarantee illustrates the “professionalization” of crypto’s illicit ecosystem. “Huione and all vendors operating on their platform have processed more than $70 billion in crypto transactions since 2021. This platform has provided infrastructure which facilitates the sale of scam technology and processed on-chain transactions for pig butchering and other fraud and scams, addresses reported as stolen funds, sanctioned entities such as the Russian exchange Garantex, fraud shops, child sexual abuse material, and Chinese-language gambling sites and casinos, among others.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

40972344,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=135200,1740772032,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Crypto Alert: Bybit Hacker’s Audacious $614M Ethereum Laundering Spree Unveiled,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bybit-hack-ethereum-laundering/,"In a shocking turn of events that has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency world, the hacker responsible for the massive Bybit hack is moving stolen funds at an alarming pace. Just one week after the cyber heist, over half of the pilfered Ethereum (ETH) has already been laundered, raising serious concerns about crypto exchange security and the sophistication of modern-day digital criminals. Let’s dive into the details of this brazen act and what it means for the future of crypto safety. What Happened in the Bybit Hack? Unveiling the Crypto Heist On February 26th, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) dropped a bombshell, pointing fingers at North Korea for orchestrating a staggering $1.5 billion virtual asset theft from the crypto exchange Bybit around February 21st. This revelation came hot on the heels of blockchain analytics firm Spot On Chain’s report highlighting the rapid movement of stolen funds. According to their analysis on X, the hacker has successfully laundered a significant chunk of the Ethereum stolen in the attack. Here’s a breakdown of the key figures: Total Ethereum Stolen: 499,000 ETH Ethereum Laundered in One Week: 266,309 ETH Value of Laundered Ethereum: $614 million Percentage of Total Stolen Funds Laundered: 53.3% Average Daily Laundering Rate: 48,420 ETH These numbers are staggering. To put it into perspective, imagine over half a billion dollars worth of cryptocurrency vanishing into the digital ether in just seven days! This incident underscores the immense scale of cyber threats facing the crypto industry and the urgent need for robust security measures. Ethereum Stolen: Why ETH and How Was it Moved? Why Ethereum? ETH, being the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and widely used in decentralized finance (DeFi), is a highly liquid and sought-after asset. This makes it a prime target for hackers looking to steal and subsequently launder large sums. The Ethereum stolen from Bybit was primarily processed through THORChain exchanges, a decentralized cross-chain liquidity protocol. THORChain acts as a bridge, enabling users to swap assets across different blockchains without relying on centralized intermediaries. In this case, the hacker utilized THORChain to convert the stolen ETH into Bitcoin (BTC). This cross-chain swapping is a common tactic in crypto laundering because it obfuscates the trail of funds and makes it harder for authorities to track the stolen assets back to their origin. Here’s a simplified view of the laundering process: Theft: Hackers breach Bybit and steal 499,000 ETH. Initial Movement: Stolen ETH is likely moved through various intermediary wallets to further obscure its origin. THORChain Exchange: Large amounts of ETH are deposited into THORChain. Conversion to Bitcoin: ETH is swapped for Bitcoin (BTC) through THORChain’s decentralized exchange. Further Laundering: The Bitcoin is likely moved through mixers, tumblers, or other privacy-enhancing services to further break the transaction trail and make it virtually untraceable. The speed at which this crypto laundering operation is being conducted is particularly alarming. At a daily average of 48,420 ETH laundered, Spot On Chain estimates that the remaining 233,086 ETH could be cleared within the next five days. This rapid pace suggests a highly organized and sophisticated operation, further pointing towards state-sponsored actors as speculated by the FBI. THORChain Under Scrutiny: Is Decentralization a Double-Edged Sword? The use of THORChain in this crypto laundering incident raises important questions about the role of decentralized exchanges (DEXs) in facilitating illicit activities. While decentralization offers numerous benefits, including censorship resistance and greater user control, it can also be exploited by malicious actors seeking to bypass traditional regulatory frameworks. Is THORChain to blame? Not directly. THORChain, as a protocol, is designed to facilitate cross-chain swaps, and like any tool, it can be used for both legitimate and illegitimate purposes. However, this incident might prompt increased scrutiny of DEXs and cross-chain protocols, potentially leading to discussions about implementing measures to mitigate their use in money laundering without compromising their core principles of decentralization and privacy. North Korea Crypto Theft: The Shadowy Suspect Behind the Bybit Breach The FBI’s accusation that North Korea crypto theft is behind the Bybit hack adds a geopolitical dimension to this already complex situation. North Korea has been increasingly implicated in cybercrime and cryptocurrency theft as a means to circumvent international sanctions and fund its regime. If these allegations are true, the Bybit hack would represent a significant financial coup for North Korea, further bolstering its illicit activities. It also highlights the growing nexus between state-sponsored cybercrime and the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Nations like North Korea are likely attracted to crypto due to its pseudo-anonymous nature and the relative ease with which large sums can be moved across borders, evading traditional financial surveillance systems. Can Crypto Exchanges Prevent Future Hacks? Actionable Insights for Enhanced Security The Bybit hack serves as a stark reminder that even major cryptocurrency exchanges are not immune to sophisticated cyberattacks. So, what can be done to prevent similar incidents in the future? Here are some actionable insights for crypto exchanges and users alike: Enhanced Security Protocols: Exchanges need to continuously upgrade their security infrastructure, employing multi-layered security measures, including robust firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and regular security audits conducted by reputable third-party firms. Advanced Threat Intelligence: Proactive threat intelligence gathering and analysis are crucial. Exchanges should invest in tools and expertise to identify and mitigate emerging cyber threats before they can be exploited. Multi-Signature Wallets: Implementing multi-signature wallets for holding customer funds can significantly enhance security. This requires multiple private keys to authorize transactions, making it much harder for a single hacker to gain control. Cold Storage Solutions: A significant portion of cryptocurrency assets should be held in cold storage – offline wallets that are not connected to the internet. This drastically reduces the attack surface and protects funds from online threats. User Education: Educating users about phishing scams, social engineering attacks, and best security practices is paramount. Many breaches originate from user-side vulnerabilities. Regulatory Collaboration: Increased collaboration between crypto exchanges and regulatory bodies is essential. Sharing threat intelligence and working together to establish industry-wide security standards can strengthen the overall crypto ecosystem. For crypto users, the Bybit hack underscores the importance of: Diversification: Not keeping all your crypto assets on a single exchange. Hardware Wallets: Utilizing hardware wallets for long-term storage of cryptocurrencies. Vigilance: Being cautious about suspicious links, emails, and requests for personal information. The Road Ahead for Crypto Security The Bybit hack and the subsequent rapid crypto laundering operation represent a serious challenge to the cryptocurrency industry. It highlights the ever-present threat of sophisticated cyberattacks and the ingenuity of malicious actors in exploiting vulnerabilities. While decentralization offers numerous benefits, it also presents unique security challenges that need to be addressed proactively. The industry must double down on security, enhance collaboration, and work towards establishing robust defenses to safeguard user funds and maintain trust in the digital asset space. The speed and scale of this incident serve as a wake-up call, demanding urgent and comprehensive action to secure the future of cryptocurrency.

Meanwhile, the BNB price has declined considerably compared to last month. Amid the CZ and Binance saga, plus the BNB price downward trend, investors are shifting to the DTX Exchange. DTX Exchange is in the final stage of its presale, raising $15.1 million, thus offering the token at a discounted price of $0.18. Moreover, the DTX token will go live at $0.36, offering a 2x surge upon launch. Here's why DTX Exchange is getting massive attention. DTX Exchange Offers Hybrid Trading and Fast TPS DTX Exchange is gaining attention in the trading industry, raising over $15.1 million during its presale phase. With a community of more than 720,000 holders, the platform has seen notable early growth. It is a hybrid trading platform that runs on the VulcanX blockchain infrastructure. This technology could support high transaction speeds of 200,000 TPS. Such efficiency could help maintain smooth trade execution, even during periods of high market activity. Given BNB's low TPS of 10,000, traders may tilt towards DTX's platform. The platform offers traders a 1000x leverage to maximize their potential profits. This feature will enable users to trade with up to 1000 times their initial investment, providing greater market exposure, regardless of the user's capital. DTX's integrated trading ecosystem, along with its ongoing presale success, has contributed to increasing investor interest. Thus, DTX could be positioned as a potential competitor to established exchanges like Binance. Traders Blame CZ and Binance for Market Decline Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the former CEO of Binance, recently expressed concerns about the exchange’s token listing process, calling it “a bit broken” due to its impact on market prices. On February 9, CZ took to X to highlight how Binance’s practice of announcing new token listings only four hours before trading begins leads to price surges on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Market participants have responded to these developments under CZ’s post, with some raising concerns about market manipulation linked to Binance’s practices. Meanwhile, the BNB price has declined over the past few weeks. Over the last seven days, the BNB price has dipped by 4.29%. The BNB price fell further from $649 to $627 month-to-date, recording a decline of 3.28%. Source: CoinCodex Amid these concerns, some traders are exploring alternative exchanges. One platform gaining attention is DTX Exchange . The exchange has reportedly raised $15.1 million in its presale, attracting users looking for alternatives amid Binance’s practices and the BNB price decline. Why Investors Are Shifting from BNB to DTX Exchange DTX Exchange is approaching the final stage of its token presale which is selling out fast. So far, the platform has raised over $15.1 million, drawing interest as a hybrid trading platform. Currently, the tokens are available at a discounted price of $0.18 in the ongoing bonus presale phase. This allows investors to purchase the token at a lower rate before it launches. With the DTX token set to launch at $0.36, investors who enter at this stage will get a guaranteed 2x return upon launch. The platform also boasts 720,000 holders; some analysts expect further participation as interest grows. Recent fluctuations in BNB price and shifting investor sentiment toward Binance have led some traders to explore alternative options. Given these trends, some market watchers believe DTX could gain traction as its presale continues. Conclusion CZ and Binance are facing criticism from traders who believe the exchange's token listing practices have contributed to a market downturn. The declining BNB price has further fueled concerns, prompting some investors to seek alternative trading platforms. As traders move away from CZ’s Binance, DTX Exchange is gaining traction by raising over $15 million during its bonus presale. The DTX tokens are in high demand, and the window to grab these tokens at $0.18 is closing soon. Hence, experts suggest investors to jump in now before they miss out on the 2X returns opportunity.

The conflict follows a business suspension order issued during South Korea’s ongoing crackdown on crypto-related offenses. Upbit Legal Challenge Over FIU Sanctions It’s worth mentioning that on the morning of February 28, the organization sued the Seoul Administrative Court to overturn the FIU’s decision. Previously, the agency accused Upbit of failing to perform proper customer due diligence in hundreds of thousands of cases, leading to a three-month restriction on new customer transactions from March 7 to June 6. In response, Dunamu argues differently. In their defense, they articulated that the punishment is excessive and could harm its operations. Furthermore, the firm has followed compliance measures to address regulatory concerns. Similarly, they argued vigorously that the FIU imposed sanctions without fully considering key facts, making the decision unfair. Regulators Tighten Crypto Oversight Since the start of this year, the South Korean leadership has been making serious efforts to regulate the crypto industry. More importantly, the FIU’s crackdown is part of a larger decision of the agency to ensure strict compliance with anti-money laundering and security laws. In addition, the principalities believe stronger oversight is necessary to prevent fraud and illegal financial activities. Recently, several crypto exchanges have been penalized, and regulators have demanded higher transparency in customer verification and transaction monitoring. Despite these measures, Upbit’s legal battle signals growing tension between crypto platforms and regulators. Dunamu’s challenge could set a precedent for how authorities enforce regulations in the future. New Task Force to Tackle Crypto Crimes In a related move, South Korea has launched a Joint Investigation Unit (JIU) to address crypto-related crimes . Based in the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors’ Office, the JIU consists of 35 financial regulators and prosecutors from the Financial Services Commission and the Financial Supervisory Service. The unit’s primary goal is to investigate fraud, theft, and market manipulation involving digital assets. This follows the success of a temporary task force established in 2023, which prosecuted 74 individuals and arrested 25 for fraudulent crypto activities. The agency thinks the new unit will improve enforcement against illegal crypto activities.

Federal employees said that the mass layoff was disclosed to them in meetings they attended earlier this month with senior CFPB leaders and members of Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Anonymous tip says his team was tasked with employee termination duties An anonymous employee said that his team was tasked with duties involving the termination of the vast majority of CFPB employees. According to the employee, the team was instructed to initiate the layoff as soon as possible. The employee explained that the two entities had orchestrated a plan to eliminate the employees in three different phases with the first layoff involving probationary and term employees. The anonymous tip said that the second layoff will see about 1200 employees going home leaving a shell with a few hundred workers. The employee further highlighted that the Bureau would eliminate the remaining employees within 90 days. “My team was directed to assist with terminating the vast majority of CFPB employees as quickly as possible. Finally, the Bureau would ‘reduce altogether’ within 60-90 days by terminating most of its remaining staff.” Anonymous employee Since operatives from DOGE arrived at the Bureau this month, the agency has shuttered its Washington headquarters and initiated the first round of layoffs, sending about 200 probationary and term employees home. The employees who remained after the first layoff were instructed to stop working until a March 3 hearing. The employees filed a trove of statements late Thursday. The filings were made in the legal proceedings initiated by a CFPB union. The case suspended acting Director Russell Vought’s moves to shutter the agency. The documents show an apparent disconnect between some of the external messaging from Vought and the behind-the-scenes activity at the bureau. Vought pushed back against the idea that he planned to eliminate the CFPB through a motion filed recently. He wrote that the logic of running a seamless and efficient bureau is that CFPB will continue to exist. Trump’s administration plans to shrink CFPB employee count to five Another anonymous tip hinted that Trump’s administration plans to lower the CFPB to the barest minimum staffing required under the law. The Bureau only needs 5 employees. The tip mentioned that the staff were briefed by Senior Executives that the CFPB employees will be laid off except for five statutorily mandated positions. The employee added that one senior executive said the Bureau will become a room at the Federal Reserve, the White House, or the Treasury with only five individuals and a phone. Elon Musk confirmed the Bureau’s crackdown after he tweeted “CFPB RIP” on 8th February this year. CFPB RIP 🪦 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 7, 2025 Additionally, the agency has constantly received criticism from financial institutions and republicans who called it a rogue agency that exploits its legal authority to punish companies. Senior CFPB staff appeared to defer to DOGE employees for critical matters in several instances. DOGE operative Jordan Wick stated that the efficiency department wanted a massive round of layoffs by Feb. 14. According to the anonymous employee, the Bureau intended to comply and fire the vast majority of the remaining employees on the given date. The employee added that a Court’s order temporarily prohibited the layoff from happening. The efficiency department has been on the move to cut federal expenses and wastage of government resources. Since its establishment, the department has targeted several agencies including the Department of Defense, Internal Revenue Service (IRS), National Institutes of Health, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Treasury, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), as well as the Department of Education. DOGE’s activities have faced criticism and pushback from some government departments and federal workers’ unions. For instance, the unions sued the Treasury Department, arguing that the agency had illegally granted Musk access to sensitive personal and financial information including Social Security benefits and tax refunds.

Rejecting the monthly low, it will likely resume pressure as soon as the supply level increases XLM recently took a break in selling after testing a low of $0.26 earlier this month. It managed to retrace to $0.37 after a week and the price remains stuck under this level for a couple of days. Last week, it initiated drops and slowly resumed selling after failing to sustain retracement. That drop became highly volatile this week and the price slipped, but the monthly support stood firm. A breakdown there will confirm a continuation pattern on the higher timeframe. Meanwhile, the latest bearish move is targeted at $0.15. Once the price hits this level, we may see a nice retracement before resuming bearish. Failure to hold the target level could result in more dips until it finds a key support level. Currently, there are no signs of a buy as the bears are gaining control. An exhaustion of the selling should give the bulls an opportunity to step back. As of now, they are off the market. For now, XLM is still painting a strong bearish picture on the short-term trend with a lower low and lower high pattern on the daily chart. Though its mid-term bullish sentiments are still in play, it may completely fade off as the price continues to roll over. XLM’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview The $0.26 support is still holding in the latest lower movement. Looking ahead, the support level to consider for a dip is $0.22, followed by $0.189 in the near term. In case of a retracement, the flipped $0.3 level is now held as resistance. A climb above this resistance could allow more retracement to $0.35 and $0.41. The higher resistance level for a test is $0.51. Key Resistance Levels: $0.3, $0.41, $0.51 Key Support Levels: $0.26, $0.22, $0.189 Spot Price: $0.283 Trend: Bearish Volatility: Moderate Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Analysts warn that this price range could act as a magnet for further downturns in the Bitcoin price, making it a critical area to watch in the coming days. According to crypto analyst Rekt Capital on X (formerly Twitter), Bitcoin is currently facing increased volatility as it moves closer to filling a key CME gap between $78,000 and $80,700. A CME gap represents price disparities on the Bitcoin Futures chart traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Open Bitcoin CME Gap Signal Further Downturn Typically, the CME Bitcoin Futures market operates only on weekdays, meaning price movements that occur during weekends tend to leave price gaps. These spaces get filled as price action retraces to cover the imbalances left behind. Related Reading: Bitcoin Liquidity Blocks Tell A Story: Here’s Why $96,000-$111,000 Is Most Important Bitcoin’s current CME gap between $78,000 and $80,700 was formed in early November 2024, when the cryptocurrency experienced a sharp price breakout above resistance. Since then, Bitcoin has not revisited this zone; however, Rekt Capital believes it is fast approaching it now. The analyst revealed that after hitting a peak above $100,000, Bitcoin quickly retraced, experiencing a deep correction that pushed it down to its current price of $79,267. Rekt Capital points out that Bitcoin’s recent decline aligns with historical fractals where CME gaps get filled before its price finds a new direction. According to his chart analysis, if Bitcoin continues on its current downward trajectory, the price range between $78,000 and $80,000 will need to be closely monitored. Holding this range would signal a potential reversal and renewed bullish momentum. However, a failure to maintain support could clear to further declines, with the next major support levels around $71,535 and $60,590. Other market analysts share a similar sentiment. Crypto VIP Signal on X has projected a decline towards the $72,000 – $74,000 support area should Bitcoin fail to maintain the CME gap price level. The analyst highlights that this gap range is BTC’s last chance for a price bounce as the market looks increasingly bearish. BTC Enters Oversold Levels For The First Time Since 2024 In addition to its recently opened CME gap, Bitcoin has also entered oversold conditions for the first time since August 2024. This suggests that the Bitcoin price has dropped significantly and is supposedly trading below its actual value, potentially signaling a possible rebound. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Forms Double Bottom After Crash, Is A Bounce To $112,000 ATH Possible? Considering the current declined state of the market, this new discovery is seen as a positive signal. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed that in 2024, when Bitcoin reached similar oversold levels, it led to a massive 33% price surge. This implies that if historical trends were to repeat, BTC could also initiate a strong price rally to the upside.

Budget-friendly digital currencies allow for larger holdings and greater potential returns when prices increase. With the digital currency market preparing for major developments in 2025, several promising options are gaining attention due to their technology, utility, and increasing usage. BlockDAG is a leading option in this category, driving excitement with a record-breaking presale and an expanding mining community. Alongside it, Stellar, Hedera, and Dogecoin are showcasing their strength through strategic alliances and technical advancements. Each of these digital currencies currently trades below $1, providing a blend of growth potential and solid fundamentals. Here’s why they are worth observing. 1. BlockDAG BlockDAG is redefining scalability in the digital currency space, and its successful presale confirms this. The project has raised over $199.5 million to date, selling over 18.7 billion BDAG coins at a current price of $0.0248, a 2380% surge since the beginning. A significant aspect of its appeal is its DAG-based architecture, which enables faster and less expensive transactions compared to traditional blockchain models. The network is also attracting thousands of users through its X1 Miner app, which has surpassed 500,000 active users, making BDAG one of the most accessible digital currencies to mine. Growth is accelerating, and BlockDAG is scheduled to be listed on 10 major centralized exchanges (CEXs) this year, enhancing its liquidity and visibility. The project’s Telegram Tap Miner NFTs are now integrated into the OKX wallet, adding another layer of functionality. With its scalable technology and growing ecosystem, BDAG stands out as a top crypto to buy under $1 for those seeking to participate before major exchange listings. The current batch is Batch 27. 2. Stellar Stellar has established a strong reputation for providing fast and low-cost cross-border payments, but its recent entry into smart contracts could be a major driver of growth. The Soroban smart contract platform is set to launch soon, introducing new capabilities and opening opportunities for decentralized applications (dApps) on Stellar’s network. This upgrade aims to attract developers and expand Stellar’s applications beyond payments. With established strategic partnerships, including collaborations with IBM, Stellar has positioned itself as a leading choice for financial institutions. XLM is currently trading at $0.3271, with recent price activity indicating increased confidence. While a 100x increase is unlikely in the near term, the combination of institutional support and technical upgrades makes Stellar a top crypto to buy for long-term potential. 3. Hedera Hedera is solidifying its position as a leading enterprise-focused blockchain, thanks to its hashgraph consensus mechanism, which allows for faster transactions, lower fees, and high security. Major corporations like Google, IBM, and Boeing are already associated with the network, reinforcing its credibility in the corporate sector. The recent partnership with Taurus aims to enhance staking, custody, and tokenization solutions, paving the way for institutional adoption. Currently, HBAR is priced at $0.2055, with strong growth potential as more businesses integrate its technology. While a rapid 100x increase is not expected soon, Hedera’s focus on real-world utility and efficiency makes it a top crypto to buy for those interested in enterprise-grade blockchain solutions. 4. Dogecoin Dogecoin remains a popular meme coin, but its price movements are showing signs of strength beyond social media hype. Recent on-chain data indicates that large transactions are taking place, suggesting that major players are accumulating DOGE. This often precedes significant market movements, implying that Dogecoin could be preparing for a breakout. Currently, DOGE is trading at $0.2512, and analysts are monitoring key resistance levels around $0.34. If momentum pushes it past this threshold, Dogecoin could experience another rally similar to its previous surges. With its large community and strong liquidity, Dogecoin remains a top crypto to buy, particularly for those seeking to capitalize on meme coin trends with high upside potential. Choosing the best crypto opportunity The top crypto to buy that is priced below $1 presents opportunities for both long-term growth and short-term gains. BlockDAG is leading the way with its record-breaking presale, a rapidly expanding mining app, and upcoming CEX listings. Meanwhile, Stellar’s smart contract expansion, Hedera’s enterprise integrations, and Dogecoin’s large transaction activity highlight why these projects remain strong contenders in the market. As the market gains momentum in 2025, monitoring these digital currencies could be a prudent strategy. Low prices combined with strong fundamentals make them attractive options before the next major adoption phase begins. Whether it’s scalability, institutional support, or meme-driven momentum, these four projects demonstrate why they are the top crypto to buy right now.

While these projects face uncertainty, Web3Bay is proving that real-world utility drives long-term value. Uniswap price remains trapped in a bearish pattern, unable to capitalize on regulatory relief. Aave price drop continues amid low trading volume, making its future uncertain. In contrast, Web3Bay isn’t just another token—it’s transforming e-commerce security with blockchain-based fraud prevention and instant transactions. By eliminating intermediaries, Web3Bay ensures trustless, transparent commerce, giving businesses an edge over centralized giants. With over $1.5 million raised in its presale and a security model built for mass adoption, Web3Bay is emerging as the clear winner. While Uniswap and Aave navigate price volatility, Web3Bay is setting the foundation for the next evolution of online commerce. Uniswap Price Faces Uncertainty Despite SEC Investigation Closure Uniswap price has struggled despite positive news that the SEC has ended its investigation without taking enforcement action. The token has dropped 60% from its December high of $19.47 and is nearing its yearly low of $6.88. A critical support trendline remains intact, but technical indicators suggest a potential breakdown could push Uniswap price toward $4.20. On the daily chart, there’s hope for a short-term rebound. Uniswap price is trading within a descending parallel channel, often signaling corrective movement. Bullish divergences in the RSI and MACD suggest a possible breakout, but the long-term outlook remains bearish. If a bounce occurs, it may be short-lived before another downturn. Aave Price Drop Below $200: Can It Hold Key Support or Fall Further? Aave price drop has pushed the token below $200, marking a 24.5% decline in the past week. Despite this drop, trading volume remains low, signaling uncertainty among investors. The next key support levels sit at $177 and $141—critical zones that could determine whether Aave stabilizes or extends its downward slide. The recent Aave price drop follows a strong rally from July to December 2024, but market sentiment has since shifted. If the token breaks below $177, it may dip to $141 or even $125. However, a short-term bounce is possible, with liquidity clusters forming near $192 and $216. Investors should watch for a potential retracement before a sustained recovery. With Aave price drop creating volatility, traders should prepare for sharp moves in the coming days. Web3Bay’s Unbreakable Security: How Blockchain Protects Buyers and Sellers Security is the backbone of any successful online marketplace, and Web3Bay is setting a new standard by leveraging blockchain technology to eliminate fraud, data breaches, and third-party manipulation. Unlike traditional e-commerce platforms that store sensitive user data on centralized servers vulnerable to hacking, Web3Bay’s decentralized architecture ensures transactions remain tamper-proof and transparent. Built on smart contract technology, Web3Bay removes the need for intermediaries, securing every transaction on an immutable ledger. This means sellers receive payments instantly and buyers get verified, trustless transactions with no risk of hidden fees or payment reversals. Unlike centralized giants that control listings and manipulate pricing, Web3Bay’s community-driven governance prevents interference, ensuring a fair marketplace for all. With cyber threats at an all-time high, businesses and individuals are searching for secure alternatives to traditional platforms, and Web3Bay’s blockchain infrastructure is proving to be the solution. Its presale success—raising over $1.5 million in Stage 4 with 390 million tokens already sold—reflects growing confidence in its security model. The presale is in its 5th stage now and 3BAY tokens are priced at $0.00524. As Web3Bay prepares for its mainnet launch, early adopters aren’t just investing in a new crypto—they’re securing their place in the future of safe, decentralized commerce. When security meets innovation, mass adoption is inevitable. Takeaway Uniswap and Aave both have their strengths, but market trends tell a different story. Uniswap price remains in limbo, with a possible breakdown looming. Aave price drop has left traders questioning whether key support levels will hold. Neither project is showing the kind of momentum investors want to see. Web3Bay, on the other hand, is solving a fundamental problem—security in online commerce. It isn’t waiting for market sentiment to shift; it’s building an infrastructure that ensures fraud-free transactions and decentralized governance. The presale’s rapid success is proof that investors recognize its potential. As cyber threats rise and centralized platforms face scrutiny, Web3Bay’s blockchain-powered security could drive mainstream adoption. Those betting on price speculation might look at Uniswap or Aave, but for those eyeing long-term disruption, Web3Bay stands out as the best investment in 2025. The future of secure, trustless e-commerce starts here.

While some wait for a turnaround, others are turning to DTX Exchange, a rising platform that has caught the market’s attention. DTX now has over 700,000 holders and has entered its bonus stage at $0.18. Early buyers have a rare chance to double their investment before the token lists at $0.36, making this a critical moment for those looking for stronger opportunities in 2025. DTX Exchange’s Final Chance: Double Before It’s Too Late DTX Exchange is offering one final chance to double your investment before listing. DTX is priced at $0.18, but when it officially launches at $0.36, early buyers will see an automatic 2X gain. This isn’t just potential, it’s a guaranteed increase for those who secure their tokens before the presale ends. To make it even bigger, investors who use the LIST2X code at checkout instantly double their holdings, giving them twice the amount of DTX before trading begins. With 700,000+ holders already in, this is the last opportunity to maximize gains before listing. Beyond price gains, DTX Exchange is built for serious traders. A key highlight is Phoenix Wallet, a non-custodial storage system that gives users full control of their assets. Many platforms have restrictions or risks, but DTX ensures complete ownership and security for every trader. DTX also solves a major issue in crypto, slippage and weak liquidity. Its deep liquidity pools make transactions seamless, allowing traders to buy and sell without major price fluctuations. Whether you’re a casual investor or a pro, this means better execution and fairer pricing on every trade. Holding DTX isn’t just about price growth, it also comes with profit-sharing rewards. Large holders earn a share of platform revenues, creating passive income as the exchange expands. With listing just around the corner, this is the last opportunity to lock in gains early before DTX goes live. ADA Holders Losing Confidence: Why Many Are Moving Away Cardano price has been struggling, leaving ADA holders frustrated as the token continues to face resistance. ADA recently dropped by over 10%, with many investors watching their portfolios shrink yet again. While the project remains active, the price action has been weak, showing bearish signals despite temporary recoveries. For long-term holders, this pattern has become exhausting, as Cardano still sits far below its all-time high of $3.09 from 2021. Cardano price volatility has made it difficult for investors to trust long-term growth. Source: X, Cardano Price Downtrend Many traders expected ADA to make a strong recovery, but Cardano's price continues to struggle, showing signs of uncertainty. The token is currently retesting support levels, with analysts pointing out that the Cardano price remains under pressure, failing to break key resistance zones. This decline has left ADA holders questioning its long-term potential, with many now considering alternatives that offer stronger upside and stability. Instead of waiting for a rebound that may never come, they are searching for stronger projects with clear growth potential. Some believe ADA could recover, but Cardano's price history has made some investors hesitant to hold long-term. Conclusion With Cardano price struggling and ADA holders searching for better opportunities, DTX Exchange is standing out as the stronger choice. The final presale stage at $0.18 is ending soon, and with the listing price set at $0.36, early buyers are guaranteed a 2X return. Investors using the LIST2X code receive a 100% bonus, instantly securing a 2X boost on their holdings before the exchange launches. This is a rare window to maximize gains, and as DTX moves toward its listing, those getting in now are positioning themselves for a major upside.

The latest data is in, and it reveals a surprising trend in the wild world of memecoins. It turns out the United States is not just a major player in the general cryptocurrency market, but it’s actually leading the charge when it comes to trading memecoins featuring heads of state. Yes, you read that right – political figures are now gracing the faces of digital tokens, and U.S. addresses are snapping them up faster than anyone else. Let’s dive into this fascinating development and unpack what it all means for the ever-evolving crypto landscape. Why is the U.S. Dominating Head-of-State Memecoin Trading? According to a recent X post by crypto market insights provider Unfolded, citing data from Artemis, the United States is at the forefront of cryptocurrency trading for head-of-state memecoins. This revelation might raise a few eyebrows. Why the U.S.? Let’s explore some potential factors: Mature Crypto Market: The U.S. boasts a relatively mature and well-established crypto market compared to many other nations. This includes a larger number of crypto exchanges, investment platforms, and a generally higher level of awareness and adoption of digital assets. This robust infrastructure makes it easier for U.S. residents to engage in trading, even in niche sectors like head-of-state memecoins. High Crypto Adoption Rates: While regulatory landscapes are still developing, the U.S. has a significant population that is already invested in or familiar with cryptocurrencies. This pre-existing interest and participation naturally extends to newer, more speculative asset classes like memecoins. Cultural and Political Engagement: The U.S. political landscape is often highly visible and debated globally. The memecoins in question – CAR, LIBRA, and TRUMP – are directly linked to political figures. Perhaps the intense political discourse and culture of memetic expression in the U.S. contributes to a higher interest in these politically themed digital assets. Access to Information and Technology: The U.S. has widespread access to high-speed internet and technological resources, which are essential for participating in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency trading . Information about new memecoins and market trends spreads rapidly within the U.S. crypto community. Following the U.S. in this head-of-state memecoin trading trend are Germany, Canada, France, and Singapore, indicating a global, albeit U.S.-led, interest in this specific niche. Decoding the Memecoins: CAR, LIBRA, and TRUMP The analysis specifically highlighted three memecoins: CAR, LIBRA, and TRUMP. Let’s break down what we know about these digital assets: CAR: Likely refers to memecoins related to Central African Republic, which made headlines for adopting Bitcoin as legal tender. The exact nature and popularity of CAR-themed memecoins would require further investigation, but it taps into the narrative of nations embracing crypto. LIBRA: This most likely refers to memecoins related to the now-defunct Libra (later Diem) cryptocurrency project initiated by Facebook (now Meta). Despite the project’s failure, the name ‘Libra’ still carries significant recognition in the crypto space, and memecoins capitalizing on this name likely exist. TRUMP: Undoubtedly linked to former U.S. President Donald Trump. Given Trump’s prominent public profile and engagement with memetic culture, it’s unsurprising that memecoins bearing his name have emerged and gained traction, particularly within the U.S. crypto market . It’s crucial to understand that these memecoins are highly speculative and often driven by hype and online communities rather than fundamental value. Trading them carries significant risk, and investors should exercise extreme caution. The Allure and Risks of Head-of-State Memecoins What makes head-of-state memecoins so captivating, and what are the potential pitfalls? Let’s weigh the allure against the risks: The Appeal: Novelty and Hype: Memecoins, by their nature, thrive on novelty and internet trends. Head-of-state memecoins add a layer of political and cultural relevance, making them even more engaging and話題性 (topical). Community and Virality: These memecoins often build strong online communities, fueled by shared political views or simply the desire to participate in a viral trend. Social media plays a crucial role in amplifying their reach and price movements. Potential for Quick Gains (Highly Speculative): Like all memecoins, there’s the potential for rapid price appreciation driven by hype and FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). However, these gains are often short-lived and followed by equally dramatic crashes. Expression of Political Sentiment: For some traders, investing in head-of-state memecoins might be a way to express their political affiliations or engage in political commentary within the digital assets space. The Risks: Extreme Volatility: Memecoins are notoriously volatile. Head-of-state memecoins are no exception, and their prices can swing wildly based on news, social media sentiment, and broader crypto market fluctuations. Lack of Fundamental Value: Most memecoins, including those featuring political figures, lack any underlying utility or real-world application. Their value is purely speculative and driven by community sentiment. Rug Pull Potential: The memecoin space is rife with scams and “rug pulls,” where developers abandon a project after raising funds, leaving investors with worthless tokens. Due diligence is paramount, but even then, risks remain high. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for memecoins and cryptocurrencies in general is still evolving. Changes in regulations could significantly impact the value and legality of these digital assets . Actionable Insights for Navigating the Memecoin Market If you’re considering venturing into the world of head-of-state memecoins, or any memecoins for that matter, here are some crucial insights to keep in mind: Do Your Research (DYOR): Thoroughly research any memecoin project before investing. Understand its community, development team (if any), and the broader market sentiment. However, remember that even with research, memecoins are inherently risky. Invest Only What You Can Afford to Lose: This is a golden rule for all cryptocurrency investments, but it’s especially critical with memecoins. Treat any investment in head-of-state memecoins as highly speculative and be prepared to lose your entire investment. Manage Risk with Portfolio Diversification: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. If you choose to invest in memecoins, allocate only a small percentage of your overall investment portfolio to these high-risk assets. Diversify across different asset classes to mitigate potential losses. Stay Informed and Monitor the Market: The memecoin market moves incredibly fast. Stay updated on news, social media trends, and crypto market analysis to make informed decisions (or to decide to exit the market). Be Wary of Hype and FOMO: Memecoin prices are often driven by hype and fear of missing out. Don’t let emotions dictate your investment decisions. Avoid chasing pumps and understand that rapid gains are often followed by sharp corrections. Conclusion: The Unpredictable World of Crypto Memes and Politics The data revealing U.S. dominance in head-of-state memecoin trading underscores the fascinating and often unpredictable intersection of cryptocurrency, internet culture, and global politics. While the allure of quick gains and participation in viral trends is undeniable, it’s crucial to approach memecoins with extreme caution and a clear understanding of the inherent risks. The cryptocurrency trading landscape is constantly evolving, and memecoins, especially politically themed ones, add another layer of complexity and speculation to this dynamic market. Whether this trend will persist or fade remains to be seen, but for now, the U.S. is undeniably leading the charge in this niche corner of the digital assets universe.

Crypto exchanges have been the talk of the crypto community for several months. The failure of multiple crypto exchanges and crypto lending companies over the past several months has left investors unsure of whom to trust. DeFi’s market expansion has been spectacular, with only a decade separating the rise of Bitcoin and the altcoins. Investing in cryptocurrencies comes with a number of pitfalls. The greatest of these is the sector’s volatility, as prices are determined only by sentiment and not by the underlying asset’s value. Whom can you trust to manage your funds amidst the crypto market’s many risks ? Types of Crypto Exchanges Generally speaking, there are two types of cryptocurrency exchanges: centralized and decentralized. Each category has its perks and downsides. Globally, there are close to 600 cryptocurrency exchanges where investors can trade bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital assets. However, costs, quality, and safety might vary greatly. Decentralized crypto exchange Decentralized crypto exchanges (DEX) spread the duty of facilitating and validating crypto trades. Similar to how cryptocurrency blockchains function, anyone who wishes to join a DEX network can verify transactions. This promotes accountability and transparency. TA single entity operates centralized cryptocurrency exchanges (CEX) problem is that decentralized exchanges are far less user-friendly, both from a UI and currency conversion aspect. Decentralized exchanges, for example, do not always permit users to deposit dollars and swap crypto or use a centralized exchange to acquire cryptocurrency for use on a DEX. In addition, you will likely engage in peer-to-peer transactions. This indicates that it may take longer to locate a buyer for what you’re selling. Moreover, if liquidity is limited, you may be required to accept price concessions to purchase or sell low-volume cryptocurrencies rapidly. Centralized crypto exchange A single entity operates centralized cryptocurrency exchanges (CEX). Centralized exchanges facilitate entry into crypto trading by enabling users to transfer fiat currencies, such as dollars, directly into cryptocurrencies. The majority of cryptocurrency trading occurs on centralized exchanges. Some crypto enthusiasts oppose centralized exchanges because they contradict the cryptocurrency’s decentralized spirit. Even worse, in the opinion of certain crypto users, the corporation or organization may force users to comply with Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations. To combat money laundering and fraud, these require each user to disclose their identity, much like opening a bank account. Hacking is an additional concern with centralized exchanges. With a CEX, the exchange holds the cryptocurrencies transacted on its platform – at least temporarily, while trades are processed — increasing the danger of hackers stealing assets. In recent years, centralized crypto exchanges have increased security in response to this issue. Among other measures, they now store the majority of customer assets offline and purchase insurance to cover crypto losses in the event of a hack. If you like the convenience of a centralized exchange, you can lower your risk by transferring your crypto to a hot or cold wallet located off-exchange. Factors to consider when choosing a crypto exchange Beyond fees, take into account security, trading volumes, instructional materials, and whether an exchange lists the cryptocurrencies you’re interested in purchasing when selecting the best cryptocurrency exchange for your needs. Security As crypto has become more popular and valuable, hackers have made it their primary focus. Leading cryptocurrency exchanges such as FTX, Binance, and KuCoin have been hacked, resulting in losses of tens of millions of dollars. While exchanges frequently compensate those whose coins are stolen, no one wants to be in this position in the first place. Spreading crypto purchases over various exchanges can help you reduce your risk exposure. Alternately, make it a practice to transfer your cryptocurrency assets from an exchange’s default wallet to a personal, secure “cold” wallet. Available coins Examine the accessible cryptocurrencies on a certain exchange with care. You may be alright using a cryptocurrency exchange that trades merely a few coins. In contrast, if you are a crypto enthusiast, you could desire access to all of the more than 600 cryptocurrencies offered on Binance. Daily trading volume The availability of coins alone is insufficient if no trades are taking place. You should verify that your target coins have sufficient trading volume to provide liquidity, allowing you to easily trade your currencies and dollars. Low-volume markets can be detrimental to sales. You might purchase at a greater price or sell at a lower price than desired. Slippage is when validators place an order when there is insufficient demand. If you are a skilled crypto trader, you might wish to ensure that your desired exchange offers the trading kinds and margin you like, such as limit orders, which can minimize slippage by setting a fixed price. Remember that trading kinds including the latter are still evolving in the United States, thus the offerings of different exchanges may alter over time. Guiding materials If you are new to cryptocurrencies, you should seek a user-friendly platform with a wealth of instructional materials to assist you to comprehend this complex, rapidly evolving market. Location accessibility Lastly, do not assume that an exchange is accessible in your country or state simply because you can visit its website. Numerous state and federal governments are currently determining how they will legally and financially manage cryptocurrencies.

The digital asset market just witnessed a whirlwind. Recent data reveals a staggering $2.6 billion exodus from crypto Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). Yes, you read that right – crypto ETF outflows have reached record highs, sending ripples of concern through the investment community. But before you hit the panic button, there’s a silver lining. According to CoinShares’ Head of Research, James Butterfill, the intense selling frenzy might be losing steam. Is this just a temporary breather, or is it the dawn of a market recovery? Let’s delve into the details and unpack what this means for your crypto portfolio. Decoding the Shocking Crypto ETF Outflows: What Happened? The headline number is undoubtedly alarming: $2.6 billion in weekly outflows from digital asset ETFs . This figure represents a historic peak, surpassing any previous weekly withdrawals. To put it in perspective, this outflow suggests a significant shift in investor sentiment, or perhaps a strategic repositioning within the market. But what exactly triggered this massive movement? Several factors could be at play, and understanding them is crucial to navigate the current market landscape. Market Correction and Profit Taking: The crypto market has experienced periods of significant growth followed by corrections. Investors who profited from earlier rallies might be taking profits, leading to ETF outflows. Macroeconomic Uncertainty: Global economic factors, including inflation, interest rate hikes, and geopolitical tensions, can influence investor risk appetite. In times of uncertainty, investors may reduce exposure to perceived riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Basis Trade Unwinds: As highlighted by James Butterfill, the unwinding of basis trades seems to be a significant contributor to these outflows. Let’s break down what basis trades are and why their unwinding matters. Basis Trade Unwinds Explained: The Technical Tsunami A basis trade is a sophisticated strategy often employed by institutional investors. It involves simultaneously buying and selling the same asset in different markets to capitalize on price discrepancies. In the context of Bitcoin ETFs , a basis trade might involve buying Bitcoin in the spot market and simultaneously selling Bitcoin futures contracts, or vice versa, often related to the ETF creation and redemption process. These trades can become complex and are sensitive to market volatility and interest rate changes. When these basis trades unwind, it can create significant selling pressure, particularly in ETF markets. Imagine a large number of institutional players simultaneously closing out these positions – the sheer volume of transactions can lead to substantial outflows, as we are currently witnessing. Butterfill’s observation that most basis trade unwinds are nearing completion is a crucial piece of information. It suggests that this particular source of selling pressure might be diminishing, potentially paving the way for market stabilization. Is Selling Pressure Easing? Hope on the Horizon? Despite the record selling pressure reflected in the $2.6 billion outflows, Butterfill’s analysis offers a glimmer of hope. The indication that basis trade unwinds are nearing completion suggests that a major driver of the recent selling might be abating. This doesn’t necessarily mean the market is out of the woods yet, but it could signal a shift from intense selling to a more balanced market dynamic. Here’s what easing selling pressure could mean for the crypto market: Reduced Downward Pressure: With fewer basis trades unwinding, the constant downward pressure on prices could lessen, potentially leading to price stabilization or even a rebound. Opportunity for New Investments: As selling pressure diminishes, investors who were hesitant due to market volatility might see this as an opportunity to enter or increase their positions in crypto ETFs and the broader market. Focus Shift to Fundamentals: With the technical factor of basis trade unwinds potentially receding, market attention could shift back to fundamental factors like adoption rates, technological advancements, and regulatory developments in the crypto space. Navigating the Crypto ETF Landscape: Challenges and Opportunities Crypto ETF outflows , while concerning in their magnitude, are a part of the evolving crypto investment landscape. ETFs offer both opportunities and challenges for investors. Understanding these aspects is vital for making informed decisions. Challenges of Crypto ETFs: Challenge Description Volatility Crypto markets are inherently volatile. ETFs, while providing diversification, are still subject to this price fluctuation. Fees and Expenses ETFs come with management fees and expense ratios, which can eat into returns over time. Tracking Error ETFs may not perfectly track the underlying asset’s price due to factors like trading costs and fund management. Regulatory Uncertainty The regulatory landscape for crypto assets and ETFs is still evolving, introducing uncertainty and potential risks. Opportunities with Crypto ETFs: Opportunity Description Accessibility ETFs make crypto investment accessible to a wider range of investors through traditional brokerage accounts. Diversification ETFs can offer diversification within the crypto market, reducing single-asset risk. Liquidity ETFs are generally liquid and easily tradable on exchanges. Institutional Adoption ETFs facilitate institutional investment in crypto, potentially bringing more capital into the market. Actionable Insights: What Should Crypto Investors Do Now? The recent crypto ETF outflows and potential easing of selling pressure present a complex picture. Here are some actionable insights for crypto investors: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on market data, news, and expert analysis from reputable sources like CoinShares. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification across different asset classes, including various cryptocurrencies and investment vehicles, can mitigate risk. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging: In volatile markets, dollar-cost averaging (investing a fixed amount regularly) can help smooth out entry points and reduce the impact of price swings. Long-Term Perspective: Crypto investments are often considered long-term plays. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term market fluctuations. Review Your Risk Tolerance: Ensure your crypto investments align with your risk tolerance and financial goals. Conclusion: Navigating the Volatile Waters of Crypto ETFs The $2.6 billion crypto ETF outflows serve as a stark reminder of the inherent volatility in the digital asset market. While the headline figure is undoubtedly dramatic, the indication that selling pressure might be easing due to the completion of basis trade unwinds offers a nuanced perspective. The crypto market is dynamic and ever-evolving. Understanding the underlying factors driving market movements, like basis trades and institutional flows, is crucial for navigating this exciting yet complex landscape. By staying informed, adopting prudent investment strategies, and maintaining a long-term vision, investors can position themselves to capitalize on the opportunities that the crypto market, including Bitcoin ETFs and broader digital asset ETFs , continues to present.

Speaking on Bloomberg TV , crypto reporter Emily Nicolle argued that Bitcoin ( BTC ) is “still a very risk-on asset” that is highly correlated to shifts in the macroeconomic landscape. As such, what happens on Wall Street will be play out in Bitcoin. The downturn is also fueled by setbacks within the crypto industry, notably Bybit’s $1.5 billion hack last week has resulted in a “rough period” for the sector. Political uncertainty is another factor, she said. Some investors had been hoping for clearer regulatory developments from the Trump administration, but those expectations remain unmet. She said: “Some of the things Trump promised to do on the campaign trail have not yet come to fruition, and those are the catalysts we are looking to as potential upsides for Bitcoin.” Read more: Bitcoin rebounds after post-tariff dip; Analyst heralds new ATH in February Where does crypto go next? Investors are closely watching the $70,000 level as a key psychological and technical support zone. “If it continues to go down, then that is the next point where we will start to think, ‘OK, that’s where a lot of the risk is happening,’” Nicolle explained. She also pointed out that options markets are heavily concentrated around this threshold, meaning a break below could trigger further selling pressure. Meanwhile, the broader cryptocurrency market has suffered alongside Bitcoin. Altcoins are “all suffering too, as to be expected,” she said. In fact, some coins face higher selling pressure. Solana ( SOL ) has been particularly hard hit following a meme coin scandal tied to Argentina’s president. Meanwhile, Ethereum ( ETH ) selling pressure can be attributed to its association with the $1.5 billion hack. “Without any potential upside, Bitcoin is the tide that lifts all boats. If Bitcoin struggles, other cryptocurrencies tend to be hit even harder,” Nicolle noted. Next move for Bitcoin Bitcoin’s next move will depend on macroeconomic conditions and regulatory developments. If the Trump administration introduces reasonable stablecoin legislation or any form of pro-crypto policies, Bitcoin’s recent oes could “be a boon for Bitcoin,” she argued. “But if things don’t move forward, and markets improve elsewhere, Bitcoin will likely continue to struggle.” You might also like: Crypto losses surge 20x in February to over $1.5b, data shows",News|Bitcoin|Bybit|Donald Trump|Сrypto hack,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|ZRX,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-02-28 21:25:00

Bonk (BONK) is a crypto token built on the Solana blockchain, much like DOGE, WIF, or SHIB. Bonk is a digital asset that can be traded on a number of online platforms, such as Binance, KuCoin, Kraken, MEXC, CoinEx, OKX, gate.io, and Bybit. Bonk has a maximum supply of 93 trillion. It is important to note that 76.92 trillion BONK are already in circulation. Interestingly, despite being a meme coin, Bonk’s supply is tied to its burning process to appreciate its value. The token became popular in 2022 after an airdrop to the Solana community. Despite its popularity and appeal, Bonk is highly volatile, and wild swings in its price action are routine. Along with being a meme coin, the Bonk ecosystem is far more diverse. Several projects built around Bonk also increase its utility prospects, which makes it a popular choice among traders and is also considered the primary trigger behind its 2024 bull run. Bonk Swap, Bonk Rewards, and Bonk BOT are the main features of the Bonk ecosystem. How will the utility of the Bonk ecosystem influence the value of the coin? Will BONK scale new heights? How high will BONK go in 2025? Let’s get into the BONK price prediction for 2025 and beyond.

Whereby, the price charts confirm a bullish signal for the current price movements. Is Bonk a good investment? After its launch in December 2022, Bonk quickly gained traction. Being on the Solana blockchain triggered a huge surge in SOL’s price, attributed to Bonk’s unique distribution strategy. Bonk is a meme coin, but it has many side projects that contribute to its usability and make it more valuable than a mere dog meme coin. It is expected that by 2031, Bonk will reach $0.00014, which is approximately 7.9 times its current price, making it a good investment to consider. Why is Bonk up? Bonk gained a good portion of its value over the last 24 hours. In the last few hours, its value increased by $0.000001329. Today’s increasing pressure triggered a notable ascent in the coin’s value. Will Bonk Recover? Bonk is currently trading within its established price range. A recent price decline tested the $0.00001947 support level, which proved weak. A successful defense of the next support level of $0.00001643 is considered crucial for the current recovery. Will Bonk reach $0.000055? Bonk’s strongest current resistance level is $0.00002490. However, just a few days ago, Bonk saw some price action above this level. Bonk may not break above this level in the short term, but according to market speculation, it will reach $0.000055 by the end of 2026. Will Bonk reach $0.000100? Bonk price prediction suggests that the coin can reach $0.000100 and surpass it by 2029. When Bonk reaches this price level, its market capitalization will increase 4.5-fold. Will Bonk reach $1? According to the Bonk price prediction, Bonk may not achieve the $1 level in the foreseeable future. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $1, which seems impossible as of now. Does Bonk have a good long-term Future? Bonk has garnered much attention from investors with its community-driven value. However, analysts do not share the same sentiment and are divided in their views on the crypto pair. This is true to an extent, as after its initial surge, sustaining the momentum has proved a challenge for Bonk. According to The Cryptopolitan’s review of the cryptocurrency, it is expected that Bonk will reach a maximum value of $0.00014 by the end of 2031, which is quite a bit above its current price.

Bonk historic price sentiment Bonk price history In December 2022, Bonk was launched with a price of $0.0000001487 and made history by making a surge of more than 30% in SOL tokens. Bonk cryptocurrency quickly climbed into the top 100 by market cap, reaching $0.0000034 per coin on January 5, 2023, according to crypto market records. However, by March 2023, the price of the Bonk token had fallen from $0.0000004134, losing substantial value. In June 2023, Bonk’s price did not experience much action, and it gradually decreased to $0.0000001927 in September 2023. In October 2023, Bonk started to see bullish sentiment, with the price reaching $0.0000005518, which eventually reached $0.00002445 on December 15, 2023. Bonk closed 2023 with a price tag of $0.00001407, significantly higher than the price at the start of the year but almost 50% down from the highest price point of 2023. Bonk hit key highs in 2024, including $0.00003771 in March and an all-time high of $0.00004115 in May, before dipping to $0.0000223 in August. A late-year rally peaked at $0.00005825 in November, with the token closing 2024 at $0.00003043. At the start of January 2025, Bonk was trading at $0.00002976, and after further depreciation, it is now trending near $0.000018.",Crypto Price Predictions|Bonk,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|DOGE|ICO|TRADING|BONK|MARKET|SOL|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-28 21:29:24

To read full editions, subscribe . Solana tends to get touchy about scaling. Since day one, the network’s pitch has been a layer-1 blockchain using novel technology to run faster and cheaper than other layer-1s on offer. So it’s no surprise that when Base announced a new feature called FlashBlocks would bring its “effective block times” down to 200 ms — or half the length it takes Solana to create new blocks — Solana followers were quick to point out the somewhat-faulty logic. FlashBlocks are sub-blocks that allow for early confirmation times, but Base’s full block times will still be two seconds. Solana has a feature called shreds which operates similarly to FlashBlocks, but its full block times are 400 ms. The whole ordeal is a bit melodramatic, but it highlights something that often doesn’t get across in blockchain scaling conversations, which is that most of this stuff is basically made up anyways . When Base’s creator Jesse Pollak gets on X to say that Base is about to be “2x faster than” Solana, he reveals nothing about how he’s measuring speed, or why that would matter for Base’s developers and users. Likewise when Firedancer developers say the Solana client can process one million transactions per second in a test environment — it’s a nice sounding number that would almost certainly hit snags in the real world. Even if Firedancer could run that fast, it would be of little import: Solana is currently processing roughly 1,000 user TPS. On the Lightspeed podcast this week , my co-host Mert Mumtaz got talking with NEAR Protocol co-founder Illia Polosukhin about scaling. Polosukhin and fellow NEAR developer Bowen Wang said the blockchain will soon bring its block times down to 400 ms, and its blockchain shards — part of a scaling technique known as “sharding” — can handle 10,000-20,000 TPS each. So if NEAR is so scalable, Mumtaz asked, then why is no one talking about it? “Everybody now comes out and says they’re scaling, [and] everybody throws a number out from a marketing perspective, [and] as Solana saw, until you actually put real pressure on the system, you don’t actually know how it’s going to behave,” Polosukhin said. The more important question, in Polosukhin’s view: “What are the use cases that people are actually using blockchain for right now?” 200 ms block times sound nice. One million TPS sounds nice. But if blockchains want to be more than intellectually stimulating engineering problems with no underlying value, then use cases are the much more important conversation to be having.

The rapid sell-off has fueled speculation that a bear market could be on the horizon, with many analysts calling for further downside in the coming months. Related Reading: Dogecoin Open Interest Declines 67% In Three Months – Can Meme Coins Recover? However, despite the overwhelming bearish sentiment, there is still a chance for Ethereum to recover as the price is now testing a crucial demand level. If bulls manage to hold this area, ETH could stage a strong rebound and shift momentum back in favor of buyers. Top analyst BigCheds shared a technical analysis on X, noting that ETH is reapproaching a critical monthly demand level, which could define Ethereum’s next major move. Historically, price reactions at this level have led to either a strong bounce or further capitulation, making the current market conditions a pivotal moment for Ethereum’s long-term trajectory. The next few days will be crucial as Ethereum attempts to stabilize and reclaim key price levels. If buyers step in aggressively, ETH could start a recovery rally, but failure to hold support may lead to further downside risks. Ethereum Struggles Below $2,200 Ethereum is trading below $2,200, struggling to regain momentum after a severe market-wide correction. The altcoin sector continues to bleed, and ETH has now lost nearly 50% of its value since peaking at $4,100 in mid-December. Bulls face a critical test as they must defend key demand levels to prevent further selling pressure and attract strong buying interest. Related Reading: Litecoin Holds Solid Structure Amid Market Breakdown – Analyst Forecasts A Big Move The situation is highly volatile, with market sentiment shifting toward extreme fear. Investors worry that Ethereum could continue its decline if bulls fail to hold support and initiate a meaningful recovery. Many analysts remain cautious, warning that ETH could enter a prolonged consolidation phase if it fails to regain lost ground. BigChed’s insights on X highlight that Ethereum is now re-approaching a key high-timeframe demand zone of around $2,000. According to Cheds, this is a must-hold level—losing this zone could trigger a deeper correction, while a strong defense could pave the way for a potential recovery rally. The next few days will be crucial for Ethereum. If bulls manage to reclaim $2,200 and push toward $2,500, a reversal could take place. However, failure to hold $2,000 could see ETH drop further, potentially testing lower demand zones in the coming weeks. Price Testing Demand – Can Bulls Regain Control? Ethereum is trading at $2,120 after enduring days of massive selling pressure that pushed the price to its lowest level in months. ETH is currently holding above a high-timeframe demand level around $2,000, a crucial zone that must be defended to avoid further downside. However, sentiment remains fragile, and if Ethereum fails to hold this level, it could trigger a dramatic sell-off leading to even lower prices. Bulls face an urgent challenge to regain control of price action. The $2,200 level now acts as the first key resistance, and a breakout above this mark would be the first step toward stabilization. Beyond that, ETH must push above $2,500 as soon as possible to confirm a potential trend reversal and signal the start of a recovery rally.

If bulls fail to hold the $2,000 support, Ethereum could face increased volatility and a steep decline, potentially testing lower demand zones.

The case, which accused the cryptocurrency exchange of failing to register as a securities platform, was dropped with prejudice on February 27. Hester Peirce, known for her pro-crypto stance, expressed her disagreement with the initial lawsuit, criticizing the SEC’s regulatory approach toward the crypto industry. US SEC Hester Peirce Criticizes Regulation by Enforcement US SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce has stated that she did not support the enforcement action against Coinbase , arguing that it was part of a broader SEC strategy to regulate the crypto industry through enforcement rather than formal rulemaking. She emphasized that regulatory clarity should come from the SEC’s policy divisions, not from enforcement actions. According to Peirce, the previous SEC leadership’s decision to rely on enforcement created uncertainty, which she believes harmed the American public and the crypto industry. She argued that the unclear regulatory environment discouraged law-abiding innovators while allowing bad actors to exploit the system. US SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce stated, “Environments in which the law is unclear are havens for bad actors and hostile territory for law-abiding people legitimately trying to solve society’s problems and meet its needs.” Impact on the Crypto Industry and Legal Costs US SEC’s Hester Peirce argued that the SEC’s enforcement-heavy strategy led to costly legal battles for crypto companies, diverting resources away from innovation. She noted that instead of focusing on product development, many industry participants were forced to navigate complex legal frameworks to avoid regulatory penalties. The enforcement action against Coinbase focused on the exchange’s listing of tokens that the SEC claimed were unregistered securities under the Howey Test. US SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce criticized the SEC’s broad interpretation of the Howey Test, saying it created confusion within the industry. She stated that token issuers and other stakeholders were left to interpret regulatory intentions from hints in various SEC complaints. New Approach with the Crypto Task Force The dismissal of the Coinbase case coincides with the SEC’s decision to adopt a new regulatory approach. The Commission has established a Crypto Task Force, which will focus on developing a clearer regulatory framework for digital assets. Peirce praised this change, noting that the policy staff, rather than enforcement personnel, will now lead public engagements to create workable crypto regulations. US SEC’s Hester Peirce emphasized that this strategic shift does not mean the SEC will stop using enforcement actions when necessary. However, she welcomed the focus on creating transparent regulations, which she believes will better serve the public and the industry. “This new approach drives today’s dismissal of the charges against Coinbase,” Peirce said, “but it does not signal an end to the Commission’s use of its enforcement tool in appropriate cases.” Meme Coins Not Classified as Securities Concurrently, the US SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance clarified its stance on meme coins , stating that transactions involving these assets do not constitute the offer and sale of securities. Meme coins, inspired by internet memes and trends, are typically bought for entertainment or cultural purposes, with their value driven by market speculation. According to the Division, meme coins lack the characteristics of traditional securities since they do not generate income or confer rights to profits or assets. However, the SEC warned that fraudulent conduct related to meme coins could still face enforcement actions under other federal and state laws, according to a bill released yesterday. Moreover, the dismissal of the Coinbase lawsuit is part of a series of recent resolutions in high-profile SEC crypto cases. The SEC also dropped enforcement actions against Opensea and Gemini, while closing its investigation into Robinhood Crypto without pursuing further action. Additionally, legal experts are speculating that the ongoing case against Ripple may soon be resolved , with both parties potentially agreeing to drop their appeals.

The funds can still move, despite Circle’s ability to freeze addresses and recoup losses. On-chain investigator ZachXBT pointed out Circle is not cooperating fast enough with the recovery of funds from the Bybit hack. Some of the funds are held in USDC, which can be frozen by the issuer. The current addresses with funds from the hack are still free to transact, making it possible for the hackers to launder the funds. One of the concerns of ZachXBT is to return as much of the stolen funds as possible. Bybit already managed to refill its ETH losses but still seeks its lost funds on principle. The investigator responded to Jeremy Allaire, co-founder of Circle, aiming to bring attention to the project’s responsibility for controlling losses. The involvement of USDC in the Bybit hack arrives at a time when Circle aims to evolve its stablecoin into a fully legalized payment tool. USDC is the favored stablecoin in Europe and was recently recognized by the Dubai Financial Service Authority. The USDC stablecoin grew by 3.1B tokens in the past three months, mostly due to issuing on Solana. ZachXBT traces active USDC addresses linked to hacker activity The USDC addresses identified by ZachXBT hold just 115K tokens, a small sum compared to the scale of the $1.5B hack. Time is still of the essence in recovering funds, and even a sum of $115K may be relevant in other types of hacks. The potential to freeze funds from USDC was at first seen as a risk, but the stablecoin has the ability to stop bad actors and restore tokens to their owners. So far, USDC has banned an estimated 268 addresses , with no standard on targeting bad actors and reacting based on blockchain data. ZachXBT tracked the addresses based on the original transfers of ETH. USDC was chosen as a secondary asset and could be frozen and re-issued. Despite the threat of freezing, bad actors still use the two leading stablecoins, aiming to act fast before the funds are intercepted. Now 0xda2e has 338K USDC after receiving another 222.9K USDC after my post so here’s the tracing explained step by step probably showing its funds from the Bybit hack: 1). 0xda12 received 204.91 ETH from 0xe41B 31 hours ago in the following transaction… — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) February 28, 2025 In the past six years since the launch of USDC, crypto users remained skeptical of the freeze function inherent to the USDC token. In theory, Circle could choose to freeze any address for any reason. This time, however, the token issuer has not taken note of the small-scale funds leak. Circle is working at scale, often issuing $250M mints daily, and has paid little attention to smaller holdings. Circle has still assisted the Bybit investigation and has provided clues on tracking down the funds. ZachXBT noted that Tether had already reacted, freezing 106K USDT. Previously, Tether aimed to be censorship-free, but increased usage for scams led to the decision to target known addresses linked to bad actors. Tether’s CEO Paolo Ardoino announced the first asset freezes as early as February 22, just after the hack. The address freezes following the advice of ZachXBT. Crypto protocols assisted the hack recovery. One of the biggest sums to be blocked was for $43M in mETH by Mantle Protocol . The token had an eight-hour delay in transfers as a precaution, acting quickly to prevent the hacker from exploiting its own cmETH smart contracts. Unfortunately, other funds like mETH and ETH could not be frozen and are free to be mixed, swapped, or hidden in other ways. The hackers also moved funds through DAI, a stablecoin issued by Maker/Sky Protocol. DAI remains decentralized and has no freezing mechanism besides blacklisting addresses. The DAI stablecoin is also one of the assets most often mixed through Tornado Cash. Several other projects continued with fund freezes where it was technologically possible. ThorChain blocked all blacklisted addresses to prevent them from mixing and hiding funds. ChangeNOW DEX intercepted 34 ETH. The FixedFloat exchange froze 120K in stablecoins USDT and USDC, with no assistance from Circle. Coinex and Bitget also froze blacklist addresses.

If so, you’ll want to pay close attention to a significant update from the popular South Korean exchange. Upbit has announced a strategic adjustment to the tick size for its USDT/KRW and USDC/KRW trading pairs, a move designed to enhance trading efficiency and precision for its users. Let’s delve into what this change means for you and your trading strategies. Decoding Tick Size: What is it and Why Does it Matter in Cryptocurrency Trading? Before we dive into the specifics of Upbit’s adjustment, it’s crucial to understand what tick size is and why it plays a pivotal role in cryptocurrency trading . In simple terms, tick size refers to the minimum increment by which the price of an asset can change on an exchange. Think of it as the smallest ‘step’ a price can take, either upwards or downwards. Why is this important? Because tick size directly impacts: Order Precision: A smaller tick size allows for more granular order placement. Traders can set limit orders and stop-loss orders at more precise price points, potentially improving their execution and risk management. Market Depth and Liquidity: Finer tick sizes can contribute to a more detailed order book, reflecting a potentially deeper and more liquid market. This can lead to tighter bid-ask spreads and reduced slippage. Algorithmic Trading Strategies: Sophisticated traders and bots relying on algorithmic strategies often benefit significantly from smaller tick sizes, enabling them to execute high-frequency trades with greater accuracy. Trading Experience: For everyday traders, a refined tick size can translate to a smoother and potentially more profitable trading experience, especially in volatile markets where every fraction of a price movement counts. Imagine trying to navigate a narrow staircase with large, uneven steps versus one with smaller, uniform steps. The latter offers a much smoother and controlled ascent or descent. Similarly, a smaller tick size provides a more refined and controlled trading environment. Upbit’s Strategic Adjustment: Fine-Tuning the Trading Experience for USDT/KRW and USDC/KRW Now, let’s focus on the specifics of Upbit’s announcement. The exchange is set to reduce the tick size for the USDT/KRW and USDC/KRW spot trading pairs from 1 Korean Won (KRW) to 0.5 KRW. This might seem like a small change numerically, but in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency trading , halving the tick size can have a noticeable impact. According to Upbit’s official announcement, this update will be implemented following scheduled maintenance on March 20, between 15:00–16:00 UTC. This means that after this period, traders dealing with USDT/KRW and USDC/KRW pairs will experience a more granular price movement, effectively doubling the precision with which prices can fluctuate. To summarize the key change: Trading Pair Previous Tick Size New Tick Size USDT/KRW 1 KRW 0.5 KRW USDC/KRW 1 KRW 0.5 KRW Impact on USDT/KRW and USDC/KRW Pairs: A Closer Look What does this refined tick size mean specifically for traders of USDT/KRW and USDC/KRW pairs on Upbit ? Let’s break down the potential implications: Enhanced Order Book Granularity: The order book will now display price levels in increments of 0.5 KRW instead of 1 KRW. This finer detail can provide traders with a more nuanced view of supply and demand dynamics at different price points. Improved Limit Order Execution: Traders placing limit orders, especially those aiming for very specific entry or exit prices, will benefit from the increased precision. They can now set orders at price points that were previously unavailable due to the larger tick size . Potential for Tighter Spreads: In theory, a smaller tick size can encourage market makers to narrow the bid-ask spread, as they can now quote prices in smaller increments. Tighter spreads translate to lower transaction costs for traders. Increased Algorithmic Trading Efficiency: For algorithmic traders focusing on USDT/KRW and USDC/KRW pairs, the reduced tick size opens up opportunities for more sophisticated strategies and potentially improved profitability. It’s important to note that while a smaller tick size generally offers advantages, it might also lead to a slightly more complex order book initially, as there will be more price levels displayed. However, with time, traders will likely adapt to and appreciate the enhanced granularity. Benefits of Reduced Tick Size for Upbit Traders: Unlocking Trading Potential The decision by Upbit to adjust the tick size reflects a commitment to improving the trading environment and catering to the needs of its diverse user base. The benefits of this change are multifaceted and can positively impact various types of traders: For Scalpers and Day Traders: These traders, who often capitalize on small price movements within short timeframes, stand to gain significantly from the increased precision. They can now target smaller price increments and potentially execute more profitable trades. For Swing Traders: While swing traders hold positions for longer periods, the ability to set more precise entry and exit points can still be advantageous in optimizing their risk-reward ratios. For Arbitrageurs: Arbitrage opportunities often arise from minute price discrepancies across different exchanges. A smaller tick size on Upbit could potentially enhance the efficiency of arbitrage strategies involving USDT/KRW and USDC/KRW pairs. For All Upbit Users: Ultimately, a more refined trading environment benefits all users by fostering a more efficient and potentially more liquid market for USDT/KRW and USDC/KRW pairs. This move by Upbit aligns with industry best practices observed on other major cryptocurrency exchanges that often offer varying tick sizes based on trading pair liquidity and price levels. It demonstrates a proactive approach to continuously refine the trading platform and enhance user experience. Navigating the Changes: Actionable Insights for Traders on Upbit As Upbit implements this tick size adjustment, here are some actionable insights for traders to consider: Review Your Trading Strategies: If you actively trade USDT/KRW or USDC/KRW pairs, reassess your current strategies to see how you can leverage the increased precision offered by the smaller tick size . Adjust Order Placement: Take advantage of the 0.5 KRW increments when setting limit orders and stop-loss orders. This allows for finer control over your entry and exit points. Monitor Order Book Dynamics: Observe how the order book behaves after the change. Pay attention to potential shifts in liquidity and bid-ask spreads. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on Upbit’s official announcements and community discussions for any further updates or insights related to this change. By proactively adapting to this update, traders can position themselves to benefit from the enhanced trading environment on Upbit for USDT/KRW and USDC/KRW pairs. Conclusion: A Step Towards Enhanced Trading Precision Upbit’s decision to reduce the tick size for USDT/KRW and USDC/KRW pairs is a positive development for its user base, particularly those actively engaged in trading these pairs. This seemingly small adjustment has the potential to unlock greater trading precision, enhance market efficiency, and ultimately improve the overall trading experience on the exchange. As the cryptocurrency market continues to mature, such refinements in trading infrastructure are crucial for fostering a more sophisticated and robust ecosystem. Traders should embrace this change and explore how it can be leveraged to optimize their strategies and achieve their trading goals on Upbit .

He predicted that the world’s leading digital asset could fall between $69,000 and $76,500 by Monday. However, instead of panicking, Kendrick sees this as a buying opportunity. Bitcoin Dips Below $80,000 Recently, Bitcoin’s price briefly dropped to under $79,000. Now, it is trading at around $83,613, down by 1.10% as per CoinMarketCap data. This fall has raised questions about whether the sell-off is ending. However, Kendrick expects another major outflow from Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) following Tuesday’s $1 billion redemption. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust experienced record withdrawals in a single day as investors removed $420 million from the fund. Since the November U.S. election, net ETF purchases at the $80,000 level have fallen by $2.5 billion. Some think ETF outflows don’t matter because they are just closing trades. However, Kendrick believes these outflows are important. He thinks they show bigger market trends affecting Bitcoin’s price. Hedge Funds Are Betting Against BTC One major factor driving the price down is hedge funds’ increasing short positions. Kendrick pointed to data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which shows that hedge funds’ short positions have grown from $7.9 billion to $11.3 billion since the election. At the same time, ETF holdings surged from $23.5 billion to $40.2 billion before dropping to $37 billion. Most ETF investors still hold Bitcoin, but Kendrick warned they might panic and sell if the price keeps falling. Will Bitcoin Follow August’s Crash? Kendrick wonders if Bitcoin and other risk assets will recover or stay under pressure. Meanwhile, this recent prediction is very different from what Kendrick said before. He thinks Bitcoin will hit $200,000 by the end of this year and $500,000 before President Donald Trump’s term ends. He compared the current market to August 2024, when Bitcoin plunged from $70,000 to $50,000 in just one week. If the market follows a similar path, Bitcoin could fall another 5.5%, landing between $69,000 and $76,500. For Kendrick, that would be an ideal buying range. With new CFTC data released today, investors are watching closely to see if hedge funds will continue to affect Bitcoin’s movement. The market’s next move could determine whether this dip is just a pause or the start of a deeper correction.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Shiba Inu and PEPE face bear markets, while investors diversify into PropiChain for AI-driven real estate solutions. Table of Contents Shiba Inu and PEPE holders seek more than speculation Why are Shiba Inu and PEPE investors shifting to PropiChain? The PCHAIN utility and market potential Despite being used by investors to make millions, Shiba Inu and PEPE are in a bear movement, which has significantly triggered a negative sentiment from investors. This can be majorly attributed to the current market downturn and political issues affecting market positions. Amidst the buzz around these popular meme coins, a significant number of their holders are diversifying their portfolios by investing in PropiChain (PCHAIN) . This project promises to change the real estate sector with unique AI-driven solutions. The question on everyone’s mind is: what draws these investors to PropiChain? Is it the promise of exponential growth, the allure of real-world utility, or something more? You might also like: PropiChain could challenge Solana in 2025 Shiba Inu and PEPE holders seek more than speculation Shiba Inu (SHIB) and PEPE have long been the darlings of the meme coin market, delivering staggering gains to early investors. However, recent price struggles have cast doubt on their long-term potential. Shiba Inu’s price remains far from the elusive $0.01 mark, with analysts highlighting the unrealistic nature of such a surge given its massive supply. Even with token burns and ecosystem developments like Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s total value locked (TVL) remains modest compared to major networks like Ethereum. Similarly, PEPE has faced difficulties in regaining momentum, with a 70% decline from its highs and on-chain data reflecting dwindling market enthusiasm. Amid this uncertainty, many Shiba Inu and PEPE holders are seeking assets with stronger real-world applications and higher growth potential. Why are Shiba Inu and PEPE investors shifting to PropiChain? PropiChain is rapidly gaining traction among Shiba Inu and PEPE investors, who are looking for more than just speculative hype. The platform offers a game-changing approach to integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology, particularly in the real estate sector. One of the most compelling features of PropiChain is its fractional ownership model. Traditional real estate investment has long been dominated by high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors who have the capital to acquire entire properties. PropiChain disrupts this exclusivity by allowing users to invest in fractions of properties, which can be bought, sold, or transferred seamlessly on the blockchain. This model significantly increases liquidity, allowing investors to enter the real estate market without substantial upfront capital. The transparency and verifiability of blockchain-based property ownership also reduce fraud risks and streamline transactions. Beyond democratizing access to real estate, PropiChain uses AI-driven technology to optimize investment decisions. Its predictive market analysis scans vast amounts of data, identifying lucrative real estate opportunities with high appreciation potential. The platform’s Automated Valuation Models (AVMs) provide real-time property valuations by analyzing historical sales data, economic indicators, and neighborhood trends. Unlike conventional appraisal methods, which may be outdated or influenced by human bias, PropiChain’s AI delivers a more accurate, data-backed assessment of property values. Smart contracts further enhance the efficiency of PropiChain’s ecosystem by automating critical processes such as lease agreements, rental payments, and property transfers. Tenants can schedule automated rental payments using blockchain transactions, ensuring timely fund transfers, while landlords receive payments instantly without the delays typically associated with banks. PropiChain is not just confined to physical properties but also integrates with the metaverse through its unique Propiverse initiative. This feature allows users to take virtual tours of properties before making investment decisions, offering an immersive and globally accessible way to assess real estate assets. Security is another key factor driving the shift from speculative meme coins like Shiba Inu and PEPE to PropiChain. As concerns about legitimacy continue to grow in the expanding altcoin market, PropiChain has taken proactive steps to ensure the integrity of its platform. The project’s smart contracts have been audited by BlockAudit, a reputable blockchain security firm, providing investors with confidence in the platform’s credibility. PCHAIN’s recent listing on CoinMarketCap has also fueled further interest, solidifying its position as a high-potential altcoin. The PCHAIN utility and market potential At the core of PropiChain’s ecosystem is its native altcoin, PCHAIN, which facilitates real estate transactions, grants access to AI-powered market insights, and enables staking for additional rewards. Unlike meme coins that derive value primarily from social media trends and hype, PCHAIN is backed by a tangible and lucrative real estate market. Token holders also play an active role in governance, voting on key platform decisions to ensure a decentralized and community-driven development model. PropiChain’s presale has already raised more than $3.5 million, and investor interest continues to soar.

The verdict showcases law enforcement’s growing capabilities while highlighting persistent challenges in tracing crypto fraud. The case raises vital questions about balancing crypto’s decentralized promise with the necessity for enhanced transparency. Montana resident Randall Rule was convicted on February 26, 2025, of conspiracy and money laundering charges connected to crypto-based fraud schemes—including romance scams—that drained nearly $2.5 million from victims, according to a February 27 press release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office . Rule, who was indicted alongside South Carolinian Gregory Nysewander back in November 2022, was found guilty before U.S. Judge Jeremy D. Kernodle. The verdict came three days after the jury began deliberations regarding Rule’s involvement in the multimillion-dollar scam. “We will not stand by as our citizens are victimized by financial crimes and their life savings are stolen,” said Acting U.S. Attorney McGlothin. “We will aggressively pursue cases against scammers and against those who facilitate their crimes by laundering the criminal proceeds.” Randall Rule Convicted in Crypto Money Laundering Scheme The indictment alleges that Rule and Nysewander conspired with several unnamed individuals to launder funds from wire fraud and mail fraud schemes through the utilization of digital assets . “The defendants converted funds from romance scams, business email compromises, real estate scams, and other fraudulent schemes into cryptocurrency and sent the cryptocurrency to accounts controlled by foreign and domestic co-conspirators,” the press release states. Rule, Nysewander, and the unidentified crypto conspirators attempted to obfuscate the source of the illicit funds by instructing victims and their co-conspirators to label wire transfers as “advertising” or “loan repayments.” “The defendants also made false representations and concealed material facts when completing account opening documents and when communicating with financial institutions and cryptocurrency exchanges ,” the U.S. Attorney’s Office continues. Both Rule and Nysewander were charged with money laundering conspiracy, money laundering, and conspiracy to violate the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) . Rule faces up to 20 years behind bars on each money laundering charge and up to five years in federal prison for conspiring to violate the BSA. Justice Served, but Challenges Persist The conviction of Randall Rule provides justice for victims but does not signal the end of crypto-related financial fraud. This verdict demonstrates both the effectiveness and limitations of law enforcement efforts in addressing increasingly sophisticated digital scams. The crypto economy must reconcile its ambitions of decentralization with the urgent necessity for clearer accountability structures. Investors and authorities alike face a fundamental question: How can transparency coexist with crypto’s promise of privacy and freedom? Resolving this tension will define the sector’s future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How might this case influence future crypto regulations? The case may drive regulators to tighten crypto oversight, spurring enhanced rules for asset transparency and secure transfer protocols. This shift aims to balance innovation with risk management overall. How are law enforcement agencies adapting to crypto fraud challenges? Agencies are expanding tech capabilities, forging international ties, and enhancing digital tracing methods. Their evolving strategies reflect a growing commitment to curbing increasingly complex crypto scams. What should investors consider when engaging with digital assets amid such fraud cases? Investors should prioritize security by scrutinizing platform credibility, understanding crypto’s volatility, and staying informed on regulatory shifts. Caution and thorough research remain key in a dynamic market.

Binance, the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange, is set to ignite trading excitement with the upcoming launch of six new perpetual contracts. This strategic move is poised to further expand Binance’s already extensive derivatives market, offering traders even more opportunities to engage with a diverse range of digital assets. If you’re looking to amplify your trading strategies and explore new avenues in the crypto space, Binance’s latest announcement is something you won’t want to miss. Let’s dive into the details of these thrilling new crypto listings and what they mean for you. Binance Perpetual Contracts Expansion: What’s New? Binance’s continuous efforts to innovate and cater to the evolving needs of its user base are once again on display with this latest announcement. The exchange is adding six new Binance perpetual contracts , further solidifying its position as a premier destination for cryptocurrency derivatives trading. Perpetual contracts, unlike traditional futures contracts, do not have an expiry date. This allows traders to hold positions indefinitely, mirroring the spot market experience while leveraging the power of margin trading. This expansion provides traders with more flexibility and options to navigate the dynamic crypto market. The six new perpetual contracts being launched are: KAITO/USDC IP/USDC TRUMP/USDC ADA/USDC PNUT/USDC HBAR/USDC Unveiling the New Crypto Listings: Timelines and Details Mark your calendars! Binance has meticulously scheduled the launch of these new crypto listings over three days, ensuring a staggered rollout. This approach allows for a smooth integration and gives traders time to prepare for each new contract. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the launch schedule: March 5, 2024 KAITO/USDC: 10:00 UTC IP/USDC: 10:15 UTC March 6, 2024 TRUMP/USDC: 10:00 UTC ADA/USDC: 10:15 UTC March 7, 2024 PNUT/USDC: 10:00 UTC HBAR/USDC: 10:15 UTC All six Binance perpetual contracts will offer traders the ability to utilize up to 25x leverage. This significant leverage magnifies both potential profits and potential losses, making it a powerful tool for experienced traders but also one that requires careful risk management. It’s crucial to understand the implications of leverage before engaging in trading with it. Why These New Crypto Pairs? Exploring the Potential The selection of KAITO, IP, TRUMP, ADA, PNUT, and HBAR for these new crypto pairs reflects Binance’s commitment to providing a diverse trading environment. These tokens represent a mix of projects across different sectors of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Let’s briefly explore each one: KAITO: While specific details about KAITO might require further research, Binance’s listing suggests growing interest in this token and its underlying project. IP (Internet Protocol): In the context of crypto, IP might refer to projects related to decentralized internet infrastructure or intellectual property management on the blockchain. Further investigation is needed to pinpoint the exact IP token listed. TRUMP (MAGA): This token is often associated with political meme coins, capitalizing on trends and social sentiment. Trading such assets can be highly volatile and driven by speculative interest. ADA (Cardano): Cardano is a well-established blockchain platform known for its focus on research-driven development and scalability. It’s a popular choice among investors interested in long-term growth potential. PNUT (Peanut): Similar to KAITO and IP, further research is needed to understand the specific project behind PNUT. Binance’s listing indicates growing market attention. HBAR (Hedera Hashgraph): Hedera Hashgraph is an enterprise-grade distributed ledger technology that offers fast transaction speeds and high security. It differentiates itself from traditional blockchains with its unique consensus mechanism. The inclusion of these diverse new crypto pairs on Binance’s perpetual contracts platform caters to a wider range of trading strategies and risk appetites. Traders can now access leveraged trading opportunities on established projects like Cardano (ADA) and potentially high-growth, albeit riskier, tokens like TRUMP and others. Understanding Leverage Trading: A Double-Edged Sword Binance offering up to 25x leverage trading on these new perpetual contracts is a significant aspect to consider. Leverage allows traders to control larger positions with a smaller amount of capital. For instance, with 25x leverage, you can control a $25,000 position with just $1,000 of your own funds. This can amplify profits significantly if the trade moves in your favor. However, it’s crucial to remember that leverage also magnifies losses in the same way. Benefits of Leverage Trading: Magnified Profits: Potential for higher returns on successful trades. Capital Efficiency: Trade larger positions with less capital outlay. Access to More Markets: Leverage can enable participation in markets that might otherwise be inaccessible due to capital requirements. Challenges and Risks of Leverage Trading: Magnified Losses: Losses are amplified to the same degree as profits, potentially leading to rapid capital depletion. Liquidation Risk: If a trade moves against you, your position can be liquidated, resulting in the loss of your initial margin. Increased Volatility: Leveraged positions are more sensitive to market fluctuations. Actionable Insights for Leverage Trading: Start Small: If you are new to leverage trading, begin with small positions and gradually increase your size as you gain experience and confidence. Risk Management is Key: Implement robust risk management strategies, including stop-loss orders, to limit potential losses. Understand Leverage: Thoroughly understand how leverage works and its implications before using it. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news and developments that could impact your trades. Navigating the World of Altcoin Trading: Opportunities and Considerations The inclusion of tokens like KAITO, IP, TRUMP, and PNUT highlights the growing interest in altcoin trading . Altcoins, or alternative cryptocurrencies to Bitcoin, often present higher growth potential but also come with increased volatility and risk. Trading these altcoin trading pairs on perpetual contracts can be particularly appealing to traders seeking to capitalize on emerging trends and potentially higher returns. Opportunities in Altcoin Trading: Higher Growth Potential: Altcoins, especially newer projects, can experience significant price appreciation if they gain traction and adoption. Diversification: Altcoins can provide diversification to a crypto portfolio primarily focused on Bitcoin and Ethereum. Emerging Trends: Altcoins often represent innovative technologies and emerging trends within the blockchain space. Considerations for Altcoin Trading: Higher Volatility: Altcoins are generally more volatile than established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Lower Liquidity: Some altcoins may have lower trading volume and liquidity, which can lead to wider spreads and potential slippage. Increased Risk: The altcoin market is generally considered riskier due to factors like project immaturity, regulatory uncertainty, and market sentiment. Conclusion: Exciting New Trading Avenues on Binance Binance’s launch of six new Binance perpetual contracts represents an exciting development for the cryptocurrency trading community. The addition of KAITO/USDC, IP/USDC, TRUMP/USDC, ADA/USDC, PNUT/USDC, and HBAR/USDC pairs, with up to 25x leverage, opens up fresh opportunities for traders to engage with a diverse range of digital assets and amplify their trading strategies. While leverage trading offers the potential for enhanced profits, it’s crucial to approach it with caution, a solid understanding of risk management, and a well-informed trading strategy. As Binance continues to expand its offerings, traders have even more tools at their disposal to navigate the dynamic and ever-evolving crypto market.

Senator Shared What She Expected: “At First…”,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/whats-the-latest-on-the-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-plan-in-the-us-senator-shared-what-she-expected-at-first/,"Senator Cynthia Lummis, one of the key advocates of Bitcoin in the US government, believes that state governments will create Bitcoin reserves before the federal government takes similar action. Speaking at a crypto conference hosted by Anthony Pompliano in New York, Lummis said states are serving as “innovation incubators” and are more agile in adopting new financial strategies. “I bet you’ll see a state have a Bitcoin strategic reserve before the federal government does,” Lummis said. Pointing to global trends, Lummis noted that the United Arab Emirates has already started buying Bitcoin and sovereign wealth funds around the world are moving forward with similar investments. The concept of a national bitcoin reserve was first floated by Lummis and former President Donald Trump during an industry conference in Nashville last July. Trump then signed an executive order in January instructing agencies to evaluate the feasibility of a stockpile of the digital asset rather than committing to bitcoin as the basis for a national reserve. Lummis suggested that some aspects of the initiative could move forward without formal congressional approval. “There is a possibility that some of these could be launched without legislative authorization,” he said. “We’ll see what the White House thinks about that and then hopefully strengthen that.” Related News: How Are Binance Whales Behaving in the Recent Downturn? Custom Metric Reveals Onchain Binance Data While some state lawmakers have explored the idea of holding Bitcoin in state reserves, progress has been slow. Bills proposing state-level crypto reserves have been introduced in 24 states, according to Bitcoin Laws, but efforts in several states have stalled recently. Last month, lawmakers in Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming voted against measures that would create such reserves, citing concerns about volatility and financial risk. Even in Lummis’ home state of Wyoming, a proposal to allow the government to invest in Bitcoin failed in the state legislature in early February, with only one representative voting in favor. Lummis’ Senate bill would have the U.S. acquire 1 million Bitcoins as part of a strategic reserve, while Trump’s original proposal sought to maintain control over the roughly 200,000 Bitcoins already in government hands due to asset seizures. “We don’t have enough House and Senate members who are knowledgeable enough to have the comfort level to do that yet,” Lummis said. “That’s where you can come in. Talk to your senators and representatives. Help them understand that Bitcoin is digital gold,” Lummis said, urging Bitcoin advocates to educate lawmakers. *This is not investment advice.

This downturn is largely attributed to escalating trade tensions between the United States and China, following U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to impose import tariffs. The potential for a trade war has heightened investor concerns, leading to increased market volatility and a reassessment of risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Impact of Trade Tensions on Bitcoin The imposition of tariffs by the U.S. government has introduced uncertainty into global markets. Investors fear that retaliatory measures from China could exacerbate economic instability, prompting a shift away from riskier assets. Bitcoin, often perceived as a hedge against traditional financial systems, has not been immune to these macroeconomic pressures. The correlation between Bitcoin’s price movements and global economic events underscores its sensitivity to broader market dynamics. Technical Analysis: Key Support Levels Analysts are closely monitoring Bitcoin’s price action, particularly the critical support level at $75,000. Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, notes that losing this support could open the door to further declines, potentially targeting the $70,000 region. Historical patterns and trader sentiment suggest that maintaining support above $75,000 is crucial for preventing deeper corrections. A breach of this level may trigger additional selling pressure, as traders seek to mitigate potential losses. Historical Context and Future Projections Historically, Bitcoin has undergone periods of significant volatility, often influenced by macroeconomic events. The current correction mirrors previous downturns, where external factors prompted sharp sell-offs. Raoul Pal, founder and CEO of Global Macro Investor, previously indicated that Bitcoin could reach a “local top” above $110,000 in January before entering a corrective phase. This projection aligns with the recent price movements, suggesting that Bitcoin’s trajectory is influenced by a combination of technical factors and macroeconomic developments. Market Sentiment and Investor Behavior The prevailing market sentiment has shifted towards caution, with investors closely monitoring geopolitical developments and their potential impact on financial markets. The possibility of a prolonged trade dispute between major economies has introduced a risk-off sentiment, leading to reduced exposure to volatile assets like cryptocurrencies. This cautious approach is reflected in trading volumes and the increased demand for traditional safe-haven assets. Conclusion Bitcoin’s recent price decline highlights its susceptibility to global economic events, particularly escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China. The critical support level at $75,000 serves as a focal point for traders and investors. A sustained breach below this threshold could precipitate further declines, while stabilization above it may restore confidence and attract renewed interest. As the situation evolves, market participants are advised to stay informed about geopolitical developments and adjust their strategies accordingly to navigate the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|ASIA,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-02-28 21:52:00

The move blends traditional investment frameworks with emerging alternative assets. Cautious integration reflects evolving views on risk and diversification in modern portfolios. BlackRock Inc., the world’s largest asset manager, is incorporating Bitcoin into its model portfolios for the first time. It will allocate between 1% and 2% to the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT). The move brings the cryptocurrency into BlackRock’s $150 billion model-portfolio universe, which could create new demand for IBIT when interest in crypto markets is cooling. BlackRock’s Portfolio Adjustments Reflect Conservative Bitcoin Allocation According to an investment outlook obtained by Bloomberg, the allocation specifically applies to BlackRock’s target allocation portfolios that include alternative assets. These model portfolios, which bundle various funds into pre-structured investment strategies, have gained popularity among financial advisers in recent years. These adjustments often lead to substantial shifts in fund flows. “We believe Bitcoin has long-term investment merit and can potentially provide unique and additive sources of diversification to portfolios,” Michael Gates, lead portfolio manager for BlackRock’s Target Allocation ETF model portfolio suite, wrote in a February 27 investment commentary. BlackRock is adding a 1% to 2% allocation to the $48 billion iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF in its target allocation portfolios that allow for alternatives https://t.co/IBaQ2cyhmJ — Bloomberg Crypto (@crypto) February 28, 2025 BlackRock’s decision comes amid recent volatility in Bitcoin’s price. After peaking near $73,000 in March, Bitcoin is trading around $83,000 as of late February. Bitcoin’s price fluctuations were a key factor in the firm’s decision to limit its allocation to a 1% to 2% range. A December research paper from the BlackRock Investment Institute noted that exceeding 2% would significantly increase a portfolio’s exposure to crypto-related risk. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, launched in January 2024, saw rapid inflows, attracting over $37 billion last year. However, investor sentiment has weakened recently, with $900 million in outflows recorded over the past week. Despite this, demand for Bitcoin exposure within BlackRock’s model portfolios remains strong, according to the firm. “They all want to allocate more to alternatives, but they need guidance on how to size, scale, and rebalance the position,” said Eve Cout, head of portfolio design and solutions for US Wealth at BlackRock. The Bitcoin allocation is part of BlackRock’s broader portfolio adjustments. Due to cooling earnings expectations, the firm’s investment team has reduced its overweight position in equities from 4% to 3%. Within fixed-income strategies, it has scaled back its exposure to long-duration bonds. Bitcoin ETFs Face Record Outflows as Market Correction Test Investor Sentiment Bitcoin’s recent price dip has triggered a wave of outflows from major spot Bitcoin ETFs. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) saw a record $420 million exit in a single day. The fund shed 5,000 BTC on February 26, marking its largest withdrawal to date, and surpassing the $332 million outflow recorded on January 2. This comes amid a broader trend of declining demand for Bitcoin ETFs. Over seven consecutive trading days, nearly $3 billion exited these products, with total outflows reaching $756 million on Feb. 26 alone . Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) also saw sustained outflows alongside smaller withdrawals from Bitwise, Ark 21Shares, Invesco, Franklin, and Grayscale. Between February 24 and February 27, Bitcoin experienced a 12.48% decline, coinciding with $2.4 billion in ETF outflows for the week. Despite this, some analysts view this trend as a short-term correction rather than a lasting shift. Nate Geraci, president of ETF Store, suggested these movements could be temporary fluctuations. Still amazed how much tradfi hates bitcoin & crypto… Huge victory laps w/ every downturn. Hate to break it to you, but no matter how big drawdowns are, it’s not going away. You can either fight it or educate yourself. Most in tradfi will fight it. — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) February 26, 2025 Meanwhile, BlackRock remains focused on expanding its Bitcoin investment offerings. The asset manager is preparing to launch a Bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) in Europe to tap into global demand. With over $35 billion in net inflows into U.S. Bitcoin ETFs in 2024, institutional interest remains strong, pointing to a complex but evolving market environment. BlackRock’s inclusion of Bitcoin in its $150 billion model portfolios signals a shift in institutional investment strategies. Despite recent market volatility and ETF outflows, the firm sees long-term value in Bitcoin as a portfolio diversifier. With a cautious 1% to 2% allocation, this move could drive broader adoption among traditional investors. As BlackRock expands its crypto offerings, its approach has a high chance of shaping the future of institutional Bitcoin investment. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How might BlackRock’s move influence broader institutional crypto adoption? This cautious step may prompt other institutions to gradually include digital assets, normalizing crypto exposure in traditional portfolios. What risks do institutions face when adding Bitcoin? Bitcoin’s high volatility can spike portfolio risk, so robust risk controls and regular reviews are essential to limit potential losses. How does this integration reflect changing market dynamics? It signals a shift as traditional strategies embrace digital assets to enhance diversification and adjust to evolving risk profiles.

Recently, the spotlight has turned to an anonymous crypto swing trader who has made a significant splash in the memecoin market. This individual, tracked by on-chain analysts, executed a massive $2.65 million investment in TRUMP memecoin just hours ago. But who is this mystery trader, and what does this bold move signal for the future of TRUMP and the broader memecoin landscape? Let’s delve into the details of this intriguing on-chain activity and explore the world of crypto swing trading. Decoding the $2.65M TRUMP Memecoin Purchase: What Does On-Chain Analysis Reveal? According to a report from the keen-eyed on-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa on X (formerly Twitter), an unidentified swing trader poured a substantial 2.65 million USDC into acquiring 227,597 TRUMP tokens. This hefty purchase was executed approximately four hours before the report, at an average price of $11.65 per TRUMP. This information, derived from on-chain analysis, gives us a transparent glimpse into the activities of significant players in the crypto market. But what exactly does on-chain analysis tell us, and why is it so valuable? Transparency and Traceability: Blockchain transactions are recorded on a public ledger, making them traceable and auditable. On-chain analysis tools allow us to examine these transactions, revealing patterns and activities that might otherwise remain hidden. Whale Watching: By monitoring large transactions, analysts can identify ‘whales’ – individuals or entities holding significant amounts of cryptocurrency. The actions of these whales can often influence market trends. Market Sentiment: Analyzing transaction volumes, wallet activity, and token movements can provide insights into the overall sentiment and direction of the market. Identifying Trends: On-chain data can help identify emerging trends, such as the increasing popularity of certain tokens or the flow of funds between different cryptocurrencies. In this case, the on-chain analysis highlights a significant investment in TRUMP memecoin by a known swing trader, suggesting a potential belief in the token’s short-term price movement. The Art of Crypto Swing Trading: Is it a Path to Profit or Peril? The trader in question is not new to the TRUMP memecoin scene. In fact, they have been actively engaged in crypto swing trading with TRUMP since its inception. Crypto swing trading is a strategy that aims to profit from short-term price swings in the market. Unlike long-term ‘hodling,’ swing traders look to capitalize on price fluctuations over days or weeks. This anonymous trader’s history with TRUMP swing trading reveals a successful track record. Key Aspects of Crypto Swing Trading: Short-Term Focus: Swing traders aim to capture profits from price movements that occur over a few days to a few weeks. Technical Analysis: Swing trading heavily relies on technical analysis tools like charts, indicators, and volume analysis to predict price movements. Active Trading: It requires more active participation and monitoring of the market compared to long-term investing. Risk Management: Due to the volatility of crypto markets, robust risk management strategies, including stop-loss orders, are crucial for swing traders. Profit Potential: Successful swing trading can generate significant profits in short periods, but it also comes with higher risks. This particular trader’s journey into crypto swing trading with TRUMP memecoin has been quite lucrative. To date, they have reportedly accumulated a cumulative profit of $400,000 from these activities. This figure underscores the potential rewards that can be reaped from skillful crypto swing trading, especially in the volatile memecoin market. TRUMP Memecoin’s Current Market Position: Navigating Volatility in Memecoin Trading Despite the substantial purchase by the anonymous trader, TRUMP memecoin is currently experiencing a downturn. At the time of writing, TRUMP is trading at $11.34, reflecting a 13.94% decrease over the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. This price fluctuation is a stark reminder of the inherent volatility associated with memecoin trading and the broader cryptocurrency market. Factors Contributing to Memecoin Volatility: Market Sentiment: Memecoins are often heavily influenced by social media trends, online communities, and overall market sentiment. Rapid shifts in these factors can lead to dramatic price swings. Speculative Nature: Unlike established cryptocurrencies with strong fundamentals, memecoins often derive their value primarily from hype and speculation. This makes them more susceptible to pump-and-dump schemes and sudden price corrections. Liquidity Concerns: Some memecoins may have lower liquidity compared to major cryptocurrencies, which can amplify price volatility and make it harder to execute large trades without significantly impacting the price. News and Events: Even minor news events or social media posts can trigger significant price movements in memecoins. The current dip in TRUMP’s price highlights the risks associated with memecoin trading. While the anonymous trader’s recent purchase could be interpreted as a bullish signal, the market remains highly unpredictable. Traders and investors must exercise caution and conduct thorough research before engaging in memecoin trading. Is Cryptocurrency Investment in Memecoins Like TRUMP a Wise Choice? Actionable Insights for Investors The case of the anonymous swing trader and TRUMP memecoin raises a crucial question: is cryptocurrency investment in memecoins a sound strategy? While the potential for high returns exists, it’s essential to approach memecoin trading with a balanced perspective and a clear understanding of the risks involved. Actionable Insights for Cryptocurrency Investment in Memecoins: Due Diligence is Key: Thoroughly research any memecoin before investing. Understand its community, development team (if any), and underlying purpose (often purely speculative). Risk Assessment: Acknowledge the high-risk nature of memecoins. Only invest capital you can afford to lose. Start Small: If you’re new to memecoin trading, begin with small positions to gain experience and understanding without exposing yourself to significant losses. Diversification: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your cryptocurrency portfolio across different asset types, including more established cryptocurrencies. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market trends, social media sentiment, and on-chain data related to the memcoins you are interested in. Have an Exit Strategy: Define your profit targets and loss limits before entering a trade. Have a clear exit strategy to avoid emotional decision-making. The anonymous trader’s success in crypto swing trading TRUMP memecoin is noteworthy, but it’s important to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results. The cryptocurrency market, especially the memecoin sector, is dynamic and unpredictable. Informed decision-making, risk management, and a realistic understanding of market volatility are paramount for anyone considering cryptocurrency investment in this space. Conclusion: Navigating the Memecoin Mania and Crypto Swing Trading Strategies The anonymous swing trader’s $2.65 million investment in TRUMP memecoin serves as a captivating example of the high-stakes world of cryptocurrency trading. It highlights the potential for significant profits through skillful crypto swing trading, particularly in the volatile memecoin market. However, it also underscores the inherent risks and the importance of informed decision-making. As the memecoin landscape continues to evolve, understanding on-chain analysis, mastering swing trading strategies, and practicing robust risk management will be crucial for navigating this exciting yet perilous frontier of cryptocurrency investment.

40976504,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=135384,1740779629,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Update: Upbit Adjusts PUNDIAI Circulating Supply Schedule – What Investors Need to Know!,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/upbit-pundai-circulating-supply-update/,"In a recent announcement that has caught the attention of altcoin enthusiasts, South Korean crypto exchange giant, Upbit, has officially updated the circulating supply schedule for PUNDIAI (PUNDIX). This development, revealed on Upbit’s official website, comes directly at the request of the PUNDIAI project team. For those closely monitoring the dynamic world of crypto, particularly within the South Korean market and the broader altcoin space, understanding these adjustments is crucial. Let’s dive into what this update means for PUNDIAI holders and the wider crypto ecosystem. Why is the Circulating Supply of PUNDIAI Important? Circulating supply is a fundamental metric in the world of cryptocurrencies. It represents the number of tokens or coins that are publicly available and circulating in the market. This figure is vital because it directly impacts a cryptocurrency’s market capitalization, which is calculated by multiplying the circulating supply by the current price of the token. Market cap is often used as a measure of a cryptocurrency’s size, popularity, and potential for growth. Changes to the circulating supply can therefore have significant implications for price, investor sentiment, and the overall health of the PUNDIAI ecosystem. Here’s why keeping an eye on the circulating supply is paramount: Price Discovery: Circulating supply plays a key role in price discovery. A sudden increase in circulating supply, without a corresponding increase in demand, can potentially lead to downward pressure on the price. Conversely, a decrease in supply could, theoretically, lead to price appreciation if demand remains constant or increases. Market Capitalization: As mentioned, market cap is directly tied to circulating supply. Changes here can drastically alter a project’s ranking and perceived value within the crypto market. A higher market cap can sometimes lend more credibility to a project. Tokenomics and Inflation: Circulating supply is a critical component of a project’s tokenomics – the economic principles governing its cryptocurrency. Understanding the schedule of token release and how circulating supply changes over time helps investors assess potential inflationary or deflationary pressures on the token. Investor Confidence: Transparency regarding circulating supply schedules fosters trust and confidence among investors. When exchanges like Upbit announce updates, it signals a commitment to transparency and keeping the community informed. For PUNDIAI, a change in the circulating supply schedule is not just a minor adjustment; it’s a significant event that could influence its market dynamics and investor perception. Therefore, understanding the specifics of this update is paramount for anyone invested in or considering investing in PUNDIAI. Upbit’s Role as a Leading Crypto Exchange and PUNDIAI Support Upbit stands as one of South Korea’s premier crypto exchanges, known for its robust trading platform, stringent security measures, and significant trading volumes. Being listed on a reputable exchange like Upbit is a major milestone for any cryptocurrency project, including PUNDIAI. Upbit’s decision to announce this update on its official platform underscores its commitment to transparency and providing timely information to its users. The fact that the update was made at the project’s request also indicates a collaborative approach between exchanges and listed projects to maintain accurate and up-to-date information for the crypto community. What benefits does listing on a major crypto exchange like Upbit bring to PUNDIAI? Increased Liquidity: Upbit provides a large and active trading market, significantly enhancing the liquidity of PUNDIAI tokens. This means it’s easier for investors to buy and sell PUNDIAI with minimal price slippage. Broader Exposure: Listing on Upbit exposes PUNDIAI to a vast user base, particularly within the lucrative South Korean crypto market. This increased visibility can attract new investors and expand the PUNDIAI community. Enhanced Credibility: Being listed on a reputable exchange like Upbit adds a layer of credibility to PUNDIAI. Exchanges often conduct due diligence before listing a token, implying a certain level of vetting and legitimacy. Easier Access for Investors: Upbit provides a user-friendly platform for both experienced and novice traders to access PUNDIAI, making it more accessible to a wider range of investors. Upbit’s announcement regarding the PUNDIAI circulating supply schedule update reinforces its position as a key player in the crypto ecosystem and its role in supporting the projects listed on its platform. Decoding the PUNDIAI Circulating Supply Schedule Update: What Changed? While the announcement confirms an update to the circulating supply schedule, the specific details of these changes are crucial for investors. Unfortunately, the initial announcement is brief and doesn’t delve into the specifics of the updated schedule. To fully understand the implications, investors need to seek further information, likely from official PUNDIAI project channels, such as their website, official social media, or community forums. What questions should PUNDIAI investors be asking right now? What is the new circulating supply schedule? Investors need to know the updated figures and the timeline for any future changes in circulating supply. Why was the schedule updated? Understanding the rationale behind the change is important. Is it related to token unlocks, vesting schedules, or other tokenomic adjustments? How will this update impact the token price and market dynamics? While predicting price movements is impossible, understanding the potential impact on supply and demand is crucial for risk assessment. What are the long-term implications for PUNDIAI’s tokenomics? Does this update signal a shift in the project’s long-term token distribution strategy? Investors should actively seek out official statements from the PUNDIAI project team to gain clarity on these critical questions. Transparency from the project side is essential to maintain investor confidence and ensure informed decision-making. Navigating Crypto Exchange Announcements: Actionable Insights for Traders Announcements like Upbit’s PUNDIAI circulating supply update are common in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency. For traders and investors, staying informed and knowing how to react to these announcements is vital. Here are some actionable insights: Actionable Insight Description Monitor Official Channels Always rely on official sources like exchange announcements (Upbit’s website), project websites, and official social media for crypto news. Avoid rumors and unofficial sources. Understand the Announcement’s Context Don’t just read the headline. Understand the context of the announcement. In this case, it’s about circulating supply – a key tokenomic factor. Seek Detailed Information Brief announcements are often just the starting point. Dig deeper for details. Look for official statements from the project team for more comprehensive information. Assess Potential Impact Analyze how the announcement could impact the token’s price, market sentiment, and long-term prospects. Consider both positive and negative scenarios. Stay Calm and Avoid FUD/FOMO Crypto markets are volatile. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) or fear of missing out (FOMO). Make informed decisions based on your own research and risk tolerance. By following these insights, crypto traders can navigate exchange announcements more effectively and make well-informed decisions in the dynamic crypto market. Remember, knowledge and informed action are your best tools in the crypto space. Conclusion: Staying Ahead in the Altcoin Market Upbit’s update to the PUNDIAI circulating supply schedule serves as a potent reminder of the constant evolution within the altcoin market. For investors and traders focused on PUNDIAI and the broader crypto landscape, staying informed, understanding tokenomics, and actively seeking reliable information are paramount. This announcement, while concise, highlights the importance of monitoring circulating supply and understanding how exchange updates can influence market dynamics. By remaining vigilant and proactive, investors can better navigate the exciting yet complex world of cryptocurrencies and position themselves for potential opportunities while mitigating risks.

Just when you thought things were settling down, a mysterious player, an anonymous crypto whale, has made a splash in the Ethereum (ETH) market. A significant on-chain transaction has caught the attention of analysts and investors alike, signaling potentially big moves for the second-largest cryptocurrency. Let’s dive into the details of this large ETH purchase and explore what it could mean for the future of Ethereum and the broader crypto landscape. Decoding the Whale’s Massive Ethereum Move Thanks to the eagle-eyed observation of onchain analyst Onchain Lens, we have a clear picture of what transpired. Approximately seven hours ago, a previously unidentified, or ‘anonymous,’ entity, commonly referred to as a crypto whale due to the sheer size of their holdings and transactions, executed a substantial ETH acquisition. Here’s a breakdown of the key details of this noteworthy Ethereum whale activity: Purchase Amount: A staggering 8,186.27 ETH Dollar Value: Worth approximately $17.54 million Payment Method: The whale strategically utilized a combination of stablecoins, DAI and USDT, to execute the purchase. Average Purchase Price: Each ETH was acquired at an average price of $2,144. Wallet Transfer: Immediately after the purchase, the entire sum of 8,186.27 ETH was swiftly moved to a brand new, previously unused wallet. Source of Information: This activity was first brought to light by the reputable onchain analyst, Onchain Lens, on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter). Why Does a Large ETH Purchase by a Whale Matter? You might be wondering, “Okay, so a whale wallet moved some ETH. Why is this news?” Well, in the cryptocurrency world, movements of this magnitude by large holders, or whales, often carry significant weight. Here’s why this particular transaction is generating buzz: Market Confidence Signal: A large ETH purchase of this size can be interpreted as a strong signal of confidence in Ethereum’s future prospects. Whales, with their substantial capital and often sophisticated understanding of market dynamics, don’t make such moves lightly. Their investment can suggest they anticipate price appreciation or have long-term bullish sentiment on ETH. Potential Price Impact: While this single purchase may not immediately skyrocket the price of ETH, it contributes to buying pressure. Sustained accumulation by whales can reduce the available supply of ETH on exchanges, potentially leading to price increases over time, especially if coupled with broader market positive sentiment. Indicator of Institutional Interest (Potentially): While we don’t know the identity of this particular Ethereum whale , large transactions can sometimes be indicative of institutional investors or high-net-worth individuals entering or increasing their positions in the market. Institutional adoption is a key driver for long-term crypto market growth. On-chain Analysis Significance: This event underscores the importance of on-chain analysis in the crypto space. By tracking wallet activity and transaction data, analysts can uncover valuable insights into market trends, investor behavior, and potential future price movements that might not be apparent through traditional market analysis. Who are Crypto Whales and Why Track Them? Let’s take a moment to understand who these ‘ crypto whales ‘ are and why their activities are so closely watched. In the crypto ocean, whales are individuals or entities that hold vast amounts of a particular cryptocurrency. Think of them as the giants of the crypto market. Their actions can significantly influence market trends due to the sheer volume they trade. Characteristics of Crypto Whales: Characteristic Description Large Holdings Whales possess substantial amounts of cryptocurrencies, often representing a significant percentage of the circulating supply. Market Influence Due to their large holdings, whale transactions can create ripples in the market, affecting prices and sentiment. Early Adopters or Institutional Players Whales can be early investors who accumulated crypto when prices were low, or they might be institutional investors, hedge funds, or wealthy individuals. Strategic Traders Whales are often sophisticated traders with in-depth market knowledge and resources to make informed investment decisions. Why Track Whale Activity? Market Trend Prediction: Whale movements can sometimes foreshadow broader market trends. Large accumulations might suggest an upcoming bull run, while significant sell-offs could indicate potential downturns. Understanding Market Sentiment: Whale behavior can offer clues about the overall market sentiment. Are large holders accumulating or distributing? This provides insights beyond price charts. Risk Management: For smaller investors, monitoring whale wallet activity can be a risk management tool. Sudden large sell-offs by whales could signal potential volatility. Identifying Opportunities: Conversely, significant accumulation phases by whales could point to potential investment opportunities and areas of growing interest. Potential Implications and the Mystery of the New Wallet The fact that the Ethereum whale immediately transferred the purchased ETH to a new wallet adds another layer of intrigue to this transaction. Why create a new wallet? Here are a few possible reasons: Security and Privacy: Moving funds to a new wallet can enhance security and privacy. It might be a strategy to isolate these newly acquired ETH from other holdings or past transaction history. Portfolio Management: Whales often manage multiple wallets for portfolio diversification and organizational purposes. The new wallet could be designated for a specific investment strategy or long-term holding. Strategic Accumulation: Creating a fresh wallet might be part of a larger accumulation strategy. The whale could be planning further purchases and wants to keep these acquisitions separate for tracking or strategic reasons. Preparation for Staking or DeFi: A new wallet could be set up specifically for staking ETH or participating in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols. These activities often involve moving ETH to separate wallets for security and management. Challenges and Considerations around Whale Activity While Ethereum whale activity can be fascinating and informative, it’s crucial to approach it with a balanced perspective and understand the potential challenges: Market Manipulation Concerns: The sheer size of whale holdings raises concerns about potential market manipulation. While not always the case, whales have the capacity to influence prices through large buy or sell orders, potentially creating artificial volatility. Information Asymmetry: Retail investors often lack the in-depth market information and resources available to whales. Relying solely on whale activity as a trading signal can be risky without a comprehensive understanding of market dynamics. False Signals: Not all whale movements are indicative of significant market shifts. Some transactions might be for internal portfolio management, OTC trades, or other reasons unrelated to broader market sentiment. Volatility Amplification: Large whale trades can amplify market volatility, especially in less liquid market conditions. This can lead to rapid price swings and increased risk for all participants. Actionable Insights: What Can We Learn from This Whale’s Move? So, what can the average crypto enthusiast or investor take away from this large ETH purchase by an anonymous whale? Stay Informed with On-chain Analysis: Pay attention to on-chain data and analysts like Onchain Lens. They provide valuable real-time insights into market activity that goes beyond price charts. Consider Whale Activity as One Indicator: Whale movements are just one piece of the puzzle. Combine this information with fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and broader market trends for a well-rounded perspective. Manage Risk Wisely: Don’t blindly follow whale trades. Develop your own investment strategy based on your risk tolerance and research. Whale activity can be informative but shouldn’t be the sole basis for investment decisions. Long-Term Perspective: Large accumulations by whales often suggest a long-term bullish outlook on the asset. This can be encouraging for long-term holders of ETH. Conclusion: A Whale’s Whisper in the Ethereum Sea The recent large ETH purchase by an anonymous whale serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. While the identity and precise motivations of this whale remain a mystery, their $17.54 million investment in Ethereum speaks volumes. It underscores the continued interest and confidence in ETH, potentially signaling positive developments for its future. By tracking these significant on-chain movements and understanding the behavior of crypto whales , we gain valuable insights into the undercurrents shaping the crypto landscape. This latest transaction is not just a blip on the radar; it’s a whisper from a whale in the vast Ethereum sea, hinting at potentially exciting times ahead.

Or is it a revolutionary cryptocurrency project misunderstood by critics? The crypto world is buzzing with questions after Pi Network, the mobile-mineable cryptocurrency, found itself in the crosshairs of Bybit Exchange CEO Ben Zhou and swirling crypto scam allegations. Let’s dive into the heart of this digital drama and uncover the truth behind Pi Network’s recent headlines. Pi Network Denies Bybit Listing Offer: What’s the Real Story? Recent reports circulated claiming that Pi Network had turned down a listing offer from the popular Bybit exchange. However, Pi Network has come forward to set the record straight. According to a Cointelegraph report, the Pi Network core team explicitly stated that no such listing offer from Bybit was ever on the table. This denial directly contradicts earlier assumptions and rumors floating within the crypto community. Here’s a breakdown of the key points regarding the Bybit listing denial: No Offer Made: Pi Network officially clarified that Bybit Exchange did not extend any listing offer to them. Rumor Control: The denial aims to quell speculation and misinformation circulating about Pi Network’s listing plans. Focus on Ecosystem: Pi Network emphasizes its ongoing focus on developing its ecosystem and community before exchange listings become a primary focus. This firm stance from Pi Network highlights their strategic approach to entering the open market. Instead of rushing into listings, they appear to be prioritizing the robust development of their network and the utility of Pi Coin within their ecosystem. The “Scam” Allegations: Addressing Bybit CEO’s Claims The controversy didn’t stop at listing rumors. Bybit CEO Ben Zhou ignited further debate when he publicly labeled Pi Network a “scam” on X (formerly Twitter). This accusation stemmed from a Chinese report that warned about cryptocurrency frauds targeting elderly individuals. Zhou’s comments amplified existing concerns and sparked widespread discussion about the legitimacy of Pi Network. Let’s dissect the crypto scam allegations and Pi Network’s response: Claim Pi Network’s Response Bybit CEO Ben Zhou called Pi Network a “scam” citing a Chinese report. Pi Network acknowledges Zhou’s comments but strongly refutes the “scam” label. Chinese report warns about crypto fraud targeting the elderly, implying Pi Network is involved. Pi Network states they have not been contacted by Chinese authorities regarding any warnings and denies any connection to fraudulent activities targeting the elderly. An X account claimed Pi Network rejected a Bybit listing offer. Pi Network clarified they have no affiliation with the X account that made the claim and reiterate that no listing offer was received from Bybit. Pi Network has vehemently denied these allegations, asserting their commitment to building a legitimate and accessible cryptocurrency. They’ve distanced themselves from the X account spreading misinformation and emphasized their open communication channels for official updates. Is Pi Network a Legitimate Cryptocurrency or a Potential Scam? The question remains: is Pi Network a legitimate cryptocurrency project, or are the scam allegations valid? Navigating the crypto space requires careful consideration and due diligence. Pi Network operates on a unique model, allowing users to mine Pi Coin through a mobile app without significant energy consumption. This accessibility has attracted a massive global community, but it has also drawn skepticism from some corners of the crypto world. To form your own informed opinion, consider these points: Community Size: Pi Network boasts a vast and active community, a testament to its widespread appeal. Decentralization Goals: Pi Network aims for decentralization, with plans to transition to an open mainnet, a crucial step for any legitimate cryptocurrency. Utility Development: The success of Pi Network hinges on developing real-world utility for Pi Coin within its ecosystem. The ongoing development of apps and marketplaces within the Pi Network is a key factor to watch. Transparency and Communication: Pi Network’s official channels and core team communications are vital for maintaining trust and dispelling misinformation. Market Listing (Future): While currently not listed on major exchanges, the future listing of Pi Coin will be a significant milestone for its perceived legitimacy and market value. It’s crucial for potential users and observers to conduct thorough research, rely on official sources, and exercise caution when evaluating any cryptocurrency project, including Pi Network.

The filing has already been accepted and is awaiting an examiner. According to the document, the Trump metaverse will host an array of NFT-based digital collectibles, like images, sound files, videos, and text files featuring Trump. The USPTO filing explicitly says that the platform plans to provide “an online virtual environment for exchange of digital collectibles featuring images, sound, videos, and texts of Donald J. Trump.” The application also covers software development for virtual reality environments, blockchain-powered transactions, and the creation of digital real estate, which makes sense since Trump’s area of expertise is real estate. There’s even mention of graphic design services for virtual apartments and office buildings in the filing . Trump doubles down on NFTs The filing promised user authentication and blockchain security for users, adding that the platform would incorporate NFT authentication technology to determine the uniqueness and ownership of digital assets. The document also includes plans for a cloud-based system allowing users to mint, buy, and sell NFTs, as well as software that would enable the trading of crypto assets within a virtual economy. The filing said, “Hosting software platforms for virtual reality-based virtual worlds in which users can exchange digital goods and crypto currencies using only those images, texts, videos and sound files authorized by the 45th and 47th President of the United States of America and authenticated by non-fungible tokens (NFTs).” The list of downloadable virtual assets mentioned in the filing includes wearable digital items like virtual hats, shoes, eyewear, and handbags, as well as avatars, sports equipment, and even toys. There’s also a clear focus on VR hardware, with the document citing downloadable game software for virtual environments and even hygienic pads and covers for VR headsets. Over the past two years, Trump has launched multiple NFT collections, some of which had real-world perks like access to Trump-branded sneakers, VIP cocktails, and even a dinner at Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter, Florida. Trump has also embraced Bitcoin, pledged to make it the reserve currency of the US, and has managed to turn himself a full-blown pro-crypto alternative to current government policies. If the Trump metaverse and NFT marketplace goes live, it could have major implications for struggling metaverse tokens like Sandbox (SAND) and Decentraland (MANA), which both saw massive gains during the 2021 hype cycle but have since slumped, thanks to low user engagement and declining interest.

33767162,[object Object],1740780033,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Dogecoin’s Price To Shift Upward As DOGE Enters High-Demand Order Block Zone,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-in-order-block-zone/,"After a brief display of bullish momentum on Thursday, Dogecoin began its bearish price action, falling as low as $0.201 . In 1 month, DOGE’s price has declined by almost 40%, triggering speculations about a possible bear market phase. However, the dog-themed meme coin could still experience a rebound as it moves into a key zone. Order Block Zone Hints At An Uptrend For Dogecoin Dogecoin has been facing bearish pressure, causing its price to retest previous support levels. Meanwhile, market expert and investor Trader Tardigrade has revealed a bullish trend in DOGE’s recent price action. Delving into Dogecoin’s price action , Trader Tardigrader highlighted that the meme coin has entered a crucial order block zone for substantial buying or selling activity that may determine the stock’s future trajectory. Order block zones during heightened volatility often serve as strong support or resistance levels. Many large concentrations of limit orders are currently waiting to be executed in this zone. When this zone is filled with orders, Trader Tardigrade is confident that DOGE will move to the upside in the upcoming weeks. The experts anticipate an uptrend for DOGE since past scenarios preceded significant rallies in the following weeks, as seen on the daily chart. Should buying pressure increase as DOGE trades within this order block zone, this could ignite bullish momentum, allowing it to reclaim key resistance levels and possibly a new all-time high. A key pattern cited in the 4-hour time frame chart is further backing DOGE’s potential for an uptrend. In another X post , Trader Tardigrade noted that the meme coin has formed a Double Bottom chart pattern, an indicator that usually signals an upward trend. If Dogecoin effectively performs the bottoming chart formation, it is expected to resume its upward movement. Looking at the expert’s chart, the pattern could cause a rebound to the $0.22 level in the following days. While the double bottom hints at growing momentum, DOGE’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) has undergone a bullish breakout from a horizontal resistance line. This breakout is likely to support the meme coin ‘s anticipated price recovery triggered by the bottoming pattern. DOGE Open Interest Tanks In The Past Months Dogecoin’s Open Interest (OI) has declined sharply along with its waning price movements. Technical expert Ali Martinez reported an over 67% decrease in DOGE’s open interest over the past 3 months. This represents a drop from its all-time high of $4.07 billion in December to about $1.33 billion today. Surprisingly, investors are beginning to demonstrate interest in DOGE amid the current price drop. On-chain data shows that large investors or whales have returned to the market, heavily acquiring Dogecoin. These whales have accumulated more than 530 million DOGE in the past 72 hours, signaling confidence in its long-term prospects.",Dogecoin|Ali Martinez|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|Dogecoin open interest|dogecoin price|Dogecoin whales|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Double Bottom Pattern|meme coin|Order Block Zone|Trader Tardigrade,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-02-28 22:00:33

Amidst this volatility, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has pinpointed a critical Ethereum support level at $1,890. But what makes this level so significant, and why should you pay attention? Let’s dive into Glassnode’s insightful analysis and understand the forces shaping the current ETH price analysis . Decoding the $1,890 Ethereum Support Level: A Fortress Built by Strong Hands According to Glassnode’s recent report on X (formerly Twitter), the $1,890 price point isn’t just another arbitrary number. It represents a substantial accumulation zone where a massive 1.82 million ETH has been gathered. This isn’t just any accumulation; it’s primarily driven by long-term investors who began accumulating Ethereum starting in August 2023. These investors aren’t the typical ‘get-rich-quick’ crowd. They are displaying remarkable conviction, holding their ETH through market rallies and notably, refraining from significant selling even when ETH reached recent highs. This behavior signals a robust base of support for Ethereum at this price. Think of it like this: Massive Accumulation: 1.82 million ETH locked at $1,890 is a substantial amount, indicating strong buying interest at this level. Long-Term Conviction: Investors holding since August 2023 have weathered market ups and downs, demonstrating belief in Ethereum’s long-term potential. Reduced Selling Pressure: The lack of major selling at recent highs by these holders suggests they are in it for the long haul, reducing the likelihood of a price collapse at $1,890. Navigating the Current Correction: Where Does Ethereum Find its Footing? The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and Ethereum is no exception. Currently, we are observing a market correction. According to Glassnode Ethereum analysis, if this correction deepens, there are key levels to watch. While $2,100 might act as a minor support zone, the real battleground lies at $1,890. This is where the bulk of ETH, held by those steadfast long-term investors, resides. Consider these support levels in the current market scenario: Support Level Significance ETH Held $2,100 Minor Support Less ETH compared to $1,890 $1,890 Critical Support 1.82 Million ETH As you can see, the difference is stark. $1,890 is not just a price point; it’s a significant line of defense fortified by a substantial amount of ETH and, more importantly, by holders who have demonstrated their unwavering belief in Ethereum. The Unwavering Conviction of Crypto Long-Term Holders: A Bullish Signal? One of the most compelling aspects of Glassnode’s report is the emphasis on the behavior of crypto long-term holders . These investors, who accumulated ETH around the $1,890 mark and earlier, are not behaving like typical speculative traders. Instead of panic-selling during price dips or aggressively taking profits at highs, they are doing something quite different: absorbing supply. What does ‘absorbing supply’ mean? It means that as other, potentially shorter-term traders or newer entrants might be selling off their ETH amidst market corrections, these long-term holders are buying up that supply, further strengthening their positions and reinforcing the $1,890 support level. This action significantly reduces the probability of a complete redistribution of ETH at $1,890. In simpler terms, they are not letting go of their ETH easily, and they are even buying more when others are selling. This paints a picture of underlying strength and resilience in the Ethereum market. $1890 ETH Support: More Than Just a Price – It’s a Testament to Investor Belief In conclusion, $1890 ETH support level is not just a technical indicator; it’s a reflection of strong investor conviction and long-term belief in Ethereum. Glassnode’s analysis highlights the crucial role of long-term holders in establishing and defending this price floor. While market corrections are inevitable in the volatile crypto world, the presence of such robust support, backed by committed investors, offers a degree of stability and a potential springboard for future growth. For investors, keeping a close eye on this $1,890 level and the behavior of long-term holders will be crucial in navigating the Ethereum market landscape.

40976970,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=135454,1740780524,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Hopeful Sign? Bitfinex Traders Boldly Boost Bitcoin Margin Longs Amid Price Dip,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitfinex-traders-bitcoin-margin/,"Bitcoin’s recent price slide has crypto enthusiasts on edge, witnessing its worst monthly performance since June 2022. Amidst this downturn, a fascinating trend has emerged from the vaults of the Bitfinex exchange. Known for their uncanny ability to anticipate Bitcoin’s market turning points, Bitfinex traders are not running for the exits; instead, they are doubling down on their bullish bets, significantly increasing their margin long positions. Could this be a glimmer of hope for a market rebound, or are these savvy traders stepping into a bear trap? Let’s dive deep into this intriguing development and what it might signal for the future of Bitcoin. Decoding the Crypto Signal: Bitcoin Margin Trading on Bitfinex For those unfamiliar, Bitcoin margin trading allows traders to borrow funds to increase their trading positions, amplifying both potential profits and losses. A ‘margin long position’ is essentially a bet that the price of Bitcoin will rise. Bitfinex, a cryptocurrency exchange often scrutinized for its market influence, is seeing a surge in these long positions. Data from Coinglass and TradingView reveals a substantial increase from 50,773 BTC to over 60,000 BTC this month alone. This represents a notable 2% uptick in the last 24 hours, signaling a strong conviction among these traders. But who are these Bitfinex traders, and why should we pay attention to their moves? They are often considered ‘smart money’ – large, experienced Bitcoin holders with a history of accurately predicting market trends. Their increased long positions suggest a belief that the current Bitcoin price dip is temporary and that a significant rebound is on the horizon. This contrarian behavior, buying when others might be fearful, is a hallmark of seasoned investors. Why This Matters: Insights into Crypto Market Analysis The actions of Bitfinex traders are more than just numbers on a chart; they offer valuable insights into the current crypto market analysis . Here’s why this development is significant: Contrarian Indicator: In volatile markets like cryptocurrency, contrarian indicators can be powerful. When sentiment is broadly negative and prices are falling, a surge in long positions from informed traders can suggest an impending shift in market direction. Whale Activity: Bitfinex is known to host a significant number of ‘whale’ traders – individuals or entities holding large amounts of Bitcoin. Their collective actions can exert considerable influence on market dynamics. Market Sentiment Gauge: Increased margin longs reflect a bullish outlook among a specific, influential group of traders. This can act as a barometer of underlying market sentiment, potentially diverging from the prevailing fear and uncertainty. Potential Price Support: As these traders enter long positions, they create buying pressure, which can act as a support level for Bitcoin’s price, potentially slowing down or reversing the downward trend. However, it’s crucial to approach this information with a balanced perspective. While the increased margin longs are noteworthy, they are not a guaranteed predictor of a price rebound. The cryptocurrency market is notoriously unpredictable, influenced by a myriad of factors ranging from macroeconomic conditions to regulatory news and technological developments. Navigating Volatility: Crypto Trading Strategy Considerations So, what are the implications for your crypto trading strategy ? Here are some actionable insights to consider: Monitor Market Sentiment: Keep an eye on indicators like margin long positions, but also consider broader market sentiment analysis, news flow, and social media trends. A holistic view is crucial. Risk Management is Key: Margin trading is inherently risky. If you are considering leveraging positions, ensure robust risk management strategies are in place, including stop-loss orders and position sizing. Diversification: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your crypto portfolio to mitigate risks associated with individual asset volatility. Due Diligence: Always conduct your own research before making any trading decisions. Don’t solely rely on the actions of any specific group of traders, no matter how reputable they may seem. Stay Informed: The crypto market is rapidly evolving. Stay updated on the latest news, technological advancements, and regulatory changes that could impact prices. Let’s consider a hypothetical scenario. If Bitcoin’s price continues to decline, and these margin long positions are liquidated, it could exacerbate the downward pressure. Conversely, if Bitcoin finds support and begins to rally, these long positions could fuel the upward momentum, potentially leading to significant gains for those positioned correctly. The Bitcoin Price Prediction Puzzle: Are We Nearing a Bottom? The million-dollar question remains: does this activity from Bitfinex traders offer a reliable Bitcoin price prediction ? While their historical accuracy is compelling, it’s essential to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results. Several factors could influence Bitcoin’s price trajectory: Factor Potential Bullish Impact Potential Bearish Impact Macroeconomic Conditions Easing inflation, dovish monetary policy Persistent inflation, hawkish monetary policy, recession fears Regulatory Developments Positive regulatory clarity, institutional adoption Stricter regulations, increased scrutiny Technological Advancements Layer-2 scaling solutions, increased utility Security breaches, network congestion Market Sentiment Positive news flow, increased investor confidence Negative news, fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) The interplay of these factors makes precise price prediction incredibly challenging. However, the increased margin longs from Bitfinex traders suggest that at least a segment of the market believes Bitcoin is undervalued at current levels and anticipates a potential recovery. This could indicate that we are approaching a market bottom, or at least a period of consolidation before the next major price movement. Bitfinex Exchange: More Than Just a Trading Platform? The focus on Bitfinex exchange in this context is crucial. Bitfinex has a unique history and reputation within the crypto space. Often associated with sophisticated traders and significant market movements, its data is closely watched by analysts and investors alike. While it’s just one exchange among many, the concentration of experienced traders and potentially large Bitcoin holders on Bitfinex gives its trading activity an amplified significance. However, it’s also worth noting that relying solely on data from a single exchange can be limiting. A comprehensive market analysis should consider data from multiple exchanges, on-chain metrics, derivatives markets, and broader macroeconomic indicators for a more well-rounded perspective. Conclusion: A Glimmer of Hope or a Risky Gamble? In conclusion, the surge in Bitcoin margin long positions on Bitfinex is undoubtedly a noteworthy development in the current crypto landscape. It suggests that a segment of seasoned traders is betting on a Bitcoin price rebound, offering a potential glimmer of hope amidst prevailing market pessimism. However, it’s crucial to remember that this is just one data point in a complex and volatile market. While the historical accuracy of Bitfinex traders is compelling, the cryptocurrency market remains inherently unpredictable. Whether this bold move turns out to be a shrewd prediction or a risky gamble remains to be seen. For crypto enthusiasts and investors, this situation underscores the importance of diligent market analysis, robust risk management, and staying informed in this ever-evolving digital asset space.
