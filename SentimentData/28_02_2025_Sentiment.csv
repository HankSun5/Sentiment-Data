With an 80% reduction in volatility, Chainlink shows signs of a looming breakout as Smart DEX traders ramp up their positions. Simultaneously, SUI coin has approached key support levels following a predictable downturn, leaving traders anticipating a possible rebound. Amid these market shifts, BlockDAG (BDAG) captures the spotlight. With over 500,000 users, BlockDAG’s X1 Miner App has become a viral sensation, simplifying how to mine BDAG from smartphones. This surge in activity comes just in time as the window to mine BDAG before its anticipated exchange listings begins to close, highlighting BlockDAG as a potential best crypto for 2025 . For those eyeing substantial returns, now is the time to engage before the mining rewards taper off. Over 500,000 Users Mining BDAG: Here’s Your Chance to Join The popularity of the BlockDAG X1 Miner App has skyrocketed, with the user count crossing the half-million mark as enthusiasts rush to mine BDAG directly from their phones. This method, free from the complexities of traditional mining setups, offers a straightforward path to acquiring crypto. With BDAG poised for upcoming major exchange listings, current miners are strategically positioning themselves to accumulate coins before the expected surge in demand. If you’re scouting for the best crypto for 2025 , mining BDAG now could significantly amplify your portfolio’s growth potential. The presale of BlockDAG has successfully garnered $199 million, with BDAG currently valued at $0.0248 in its 27th batch. Early adopters have witnessed a staggering 2,380% gain, with projections suggesting a potential rise to $1 by 2025. LINK Price Sees Reduced Volatility: A Precursor to Surge? LINK’s volatility has sharply decreased to 80%, drawing the attention of savvy traders who predict a significant move ahead. Historically, reduced volatility often precedes a market breakout, and Smart DEX traders are not just watching—they’re actively increasing their holdings. With notable wallets accumulating LINK, including one that previously secured a 136% return, the sentiment is bullish. As the market anticipates LINK’s next move, the rising Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) suggests an uptick in buying pressure, possibly steering LINK price towards a breakout. SUI Coin’s Price Dynamics: Testing Key Support Levels The Sui coin has traced a path consistent with predictions, falling to $3.5165 before it tested the lower support at $3.2379. This trajectory aligns precisely with prior analyses, validating a robust pattern in its price movements. Currently, traders are closely monitoring to see if SUI maintains these levels or further declines to $2.5611. The latest insights indicate that crucial resistance and support levels are still active, and there could be a turnaround if the momentum shifts. Looking forward, should the Sui coin stabilize above $5.5840, it might set the stage for a confirmed breakout. Successfully retesting the $4.40 level could propel the coin towards $5.7788 and potentially higher. If the upward trend persists, SUI could aim for successive targets at $8.1673, $9.0186, and even $12.9780. The imminent days will be pivotal in determining whether SUI is poised for a significant rebound. In Summary As LINK price shows newfound stability and potential for growth, and SUI coin navigates critical support levels, the crypto market remains on edge. Meanwhile, BlockDAG’s X1 Miner App has attracted a massive user base, poised for success as one of the best crypto for 2025 . As these developments unfold, the race to secure prime positions in the burgeoning crypto landscape is intensifying.

In a new announcement, Binance says its adding support for MyShell ( SHELL ), a protocol that allows users to create, share and own AI agents that can be used for professional and personal assistance as well as companionship. News of addition sent SHELL flying as the digital asset went from a low of $0.462 on February 26th to a peak of $0.661 just a day later. SHELL has since retraced and is trading for $0.597 at time of writing, a 24.4% gain during the last 24 hours.

Led by OpenAI, these powerful yet proprietary models offer users advanced applications and services for complex data analysis and human-computer interactions. However, behind their impressive capabilities lie some lesser-known costs… MyShell was born from a deep reflection on the current AI landscape.

March 2025 is shaping up to be a pivotal month for several major crypto projects, with groundbreaking developments, strategic partnerships, and increased adoption fueling the industry’s momentum. The battle for dominance among blockchain networks has intensified, with the focus shifting toward real-world use cases, scalability, and decentralization. One of the most exciting projects right now is Qubetics ($TICS ) —a revolutionary blockchain platform solving the cross-border transaction inefficiencies that have plagued legacy financial systems. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies that focus solely on decentralization, Qubetics is bridging the gap between security, speed, and real-world utility, making it an appealing prospect for early buyers. Let’s explore the top five cryptocurrencies to watch this month: Qubetics, Cronos, Render, Stellar, and Celestia. 1.

The project has gained significant traction, with its presale currently in its 23rd stage, having already sold over 490 million tokens to more than 21,500 holders—raising an impressive $14.1 million.

Real-Life Impact: Cross-Border Transactions Qubetics is redefining cross-border payments, addressing challenges such as high fees, slow processing times, and centralization risks.

Notably, this comment is gaining attention in the crypto community when the market is experiencing major declines. Bitcoin Price Outlook Amid Market Fluctuations In a recent development, Kendrick reiterated his speculations that Bitcoin will hit $200,000 by the end of this year and climb to $500,000 before Donald Trump leaves office. His comments come after Bitcoin’s price dropped to a three-month low, sinking below $90,000 earlier this week. According to CoinGecko data, the cryptocurrency was trading at $86,418 earlier this week, marking a 20% decline from its all-time high of $108,786 in January. In addition, the Stanford analyst linked this decline to broader economic concerns, including uncertainty surrounding global trade tariffs and unending geopolitical tensions in regions like Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Gaza. Institutional Adoption and Regulatory Developments Furthermore, Kendrick’s recent comments also relate that institutional involvement is key to stabilizing Bitcoin and driving long-term growth. He added that conventional financial firms like Standard Chartered and BlackRock, which have introduced Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), will play a crucial role in bringing legitimacy and reducing market volatility. He also pointed out that clear regulations in the U.S. will be a driving mechanism that will strengthen the stability of digital assets in the country. This would encourage larger financial institutions to invest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Additionally, he asserted that as the clear engagement policies take shape, more U.S. banks and institutional investors will step into the crypto space, potentially leading to a more structured and secure market environment. Trump’s Influence on Crypto Growth It is necessary to add that political factors also shape Bitcoin’s future, with Donald Trump’s presidency playing a key role. After his December election victory, Bitcoin surged past $100,000 for the first time, fueled by optimism from investors who see him as pro-crypto. In January 2025, Trump signed an executive order to boost cryptocurrency adoption and create a national digital asset stockpile, reinforcing his administration’s support for the industry. Crypto firms and executives also played a major role in the 2024 election, contributing nearly half of corporate donations, with some investing tens of millions into Trump’s campaign. With strong backing from the industry, Kendrick believes Bitcoin could still hit $500,000 before Trump leaves office.

Analysts debate Ripple’s impact, with concerns over lobbying against Bitcoin. SBI VC Trade expands lending services, boosting XRP adoption and utility. Ripple’s XRP has seen price declines recently. As a result, this has led to mixed reactions from analysts. Some think the cryptocurrency is struggling due to outside factors. However, others argue it remains strong against Bitcoin (BTC). Adding another layer to the story, Japanese exchange SBI VC Trade has increased its cryptocurrency lending services, which adds more options for XRP holders Conflicting Views on Market Performance Tony Edward has pushed back against Bitcoin maximalists. Specifically, he says they are unfairly singling out XRP’s decline when the entire crypto market is experiencing a general downturn.

The body is named the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors’ Office-run Joint Investigation Unit (JIU) for Virtual Asset Crimes. The unit has been operating since 2023. But it was originally intended to function as a temporary task force. It was formed to fight what officials thought would be a short-lived spike in high-profile crypto-related fraud cases. Crypto Crime: New Unit to Tackle Fraud Cases However, the JIU has been inundated with work since its formation. And with crypto adoption and crypto-related crime on the rise in South Korea, last month, the prosecution service decided to formalize the body and grant it a certain degree of independence . A launching ceremony for the Joint Digital Asset Crime Investigation Division, held in Seoul, South Korea on February 27, 2025. (Source: Yonhap TV News/Screenshot) Per Aju News and MBC News , the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors’ Office has essentially “promoted” to the level of “formal joint investigation department.” As its name suggests, the body consists of public prosecutors. But it also comprises 11 financial regulators staffers from the Financial Services Commission and the Financial Supervisory Service. The JIU will initially have 34 full-time employees in total. Most of the staffers already have considerable experience dealing with crypto-related fraud cases. At a launching ceremony, the body vowed to investigate “unfair” crypto “practices.” These include insider trading and price manipulation cases. Since its initial inception, the body has indicted 74 people and arrested 25 individuals. A South Korean appeals court will decide next month whether the country’s main opposition leader violated election laws https://t.co/FqJPaLoKJx — Bloomberg (@business) February 26, 2025 Front-page News In recent months, the JIU’s operations became the subject of front-page news, when it began probing a suspected scam coin named Queenbee. The investigation eventually led the JIU to indict a high-profile shaman named Jeon Seong-bae, aka Geon Jin. The JIU arrested the shaman on suspicions of “handling illegal political funds from politicians and candidates” during the nation’s 2018 local elections. The unit will be led by Chief Prosecutor Park Geon-wook. His team also comprises two deputy chief prosecutors. The Southern District Prosecutors’ Office said that as crypto fraudsters become more “sophisticated, intelligent, and globalized,” it would create an “effective crime response system.” The post South Korean Prosecution Crypto Crime Unit Officially Launches appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|Legal|South Korea,EN,0,0,ASIA|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-02-27 23:30:00
40932103,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=683878,1740699010,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40932103.jpeg,US lawmakers propose act to ban meme coins like Trump token,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/us-lawmakers-propose-act-to-ban-meme-coins/,"Congress Democrats have taken a hit at Trump’s meme coin by introducing a bill in the House to ban top federal officials and their families from issuing or promoting meme coins and other financial instruments, citing ethical concerns. California Democrat Rep. Sam Liccardo is leading the push against Trump’s meme coin, though he has insistently argued that taking aim at the president’s crypto token was not his original intention when he first ran for office. He claimed, however, that Trump’s move to release a new meme coin needed some kind of response, especially since the token’s price quickly plummeted, leaving some investors with losses. Liccardo believes President Trump’s decision to launch a meme coin was unethical and an abuse of his authority Liccardo, also a former criminal prosecutor, argued that the nation should reinstate stricter anti-corruption laws, targeting Trump’s meme çoin. According to him, Trump exploited his authority, office, and the people for his personal gain, calling the president’s actions “unethical.” He added that Trump’s token raised concerns about transparency, insider trading, and improper foreign influence, saying that even some of Trump’s supporters disapproved of the meme coin launch. Thus, he introduced legislation against the token on Thursday, the Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement, or MEME Act. Liccardo even stated he had about a dozen Democratic cosponsors backing his legislation. The bill should apply to the president, vice president, Congress members, senior executive officials, and their immediate families. Violators could face fines and up to five years in prison. The bill’s draft so far dictates that Trump will have to give up his earnings from the token’s sale. Moreover, the legislation will prevent the president, any of his family members or members of Congress from issuing or promoting securities and crypto assets like meme coins. The legislation would also introduce criminal and civil penalties and bans on some financial assets. Additionally, private investors who lose their funds on meme coins promoted by state officials will be permitted to sue. Liccardo even commented, “You need to have some enforcement mechanism and a private right of action helps to keep everybody honest.” However, the bill may fail to pass in the now Republican-controlled Congress, but he believes that the legislation will lay the groundwork for Democrats if they regain power or at least show their stance against Trump’s corruption. Trump and his family have been actively involved in several crypto projects Meme coins have long been considered risky and speculative assets, with most critics comparing them to Ponzi schemes that only profit insiders and unethical celebrities. When Trump first released his token, its price quickly surged to almost $70 before dropping to roughly $12. Nevertheless, analysts believe that the token generated millions of dollars for the launching entities before its immense price drop from its trading fees. The First Lady’s MELANIA token also saw a trajectory similar to that of Trump. It surged explosively after its launch but has since fallen from its peak days, trading at only $0.8522 . Not to mention, one of the developers involved in the MELANIA token launch was found to be tangled with the LIBRA token scandal, for which Argentine President Javier Milei is still being investigated. In addition to his and Melania’s token releases, Trump and his sons launched a decentralized crypto platform in 2024 and even supported online stores selling crypto-themed sneakers. However, the president has tried to distance himself from his family’s crypto projects and overall businesses by signing an ethics agreement that will hinder him from making outside business deals. Liccardo pushes MEME Act to curb corruption, but faces political and industry resistance The MEME Act has received backing from Reps. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). But its passage in the GOP-controlled Congress is highly unlikely. Liccardo said the bill is partly a symbolic step against corruption and a basis for action if Democrats regain state legislature control. Beyond meme coins, the legislation’s broad language captures all securities and digital assets, designed to harden loopholes for indirect profits. It also requires disclosures of foreign cryptocurrency ties, but the law presents challenges for enforcement. Mixed reactions from industry: Some crypto advocates took to social media to criticize Trump’s action as a “stunt,” while others characterized the bill as politically unviable. The proposal showcases growing scrutiny of officials’ financial conduct in financial markets. The freshman lawmaker representing Silicon Valley’s 16th District since January 2025, has positioned himself as an advocate for ethical governance with the MEME Act. Yet his party faces a great deal of scrutiny over inconsistencies in addressing financial conflicts. While a few Democrats, including progressives like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC), support banning congressional stock trading, establishment figures like former Speaker Nancy Pelosi have resisted such reforms. Pelosi’s husband, Paul Pelosi, faced criticism for trades made during the Covid-19 pandemic, including a $5 million windfall trading options in Alphabet shares in advance of a hearing on tech that she oversaw. Pelosi defended lawmakers’ right to trade in the markets, saying that some proposals were “anti-free market.” Public polls show that Americans support the limitations on what could be traded. Liccardo’s concern with meme coin regulation also underscores Democrats’ larger challenge of balancing their progressive reform aspirations with powerful financial interests.

Expert trader Raoul Pal shared a bullish comment regarding SOL price in a recent post on X. He believes the coin is at its oversold level and will likely plot a rebound soon. State of the Solana Price Considering his X account , Raoul Pal said SOL is at 2 standard deviations oversold on the log regression channel. He pointed out that Solana is showcasing the lowest Relative Strength Index (RSI) since the 2022 lows. Per the onchain data, the RSI dropped as low as 25.73 on February 26, way below the oversold level . As Pal pointed out, Solana is likely to grow significantly higher in the coming month. While he is not taking new positions at the current level, he implied that this period marks the best area to buy the dip. According to CoinMarketCap data, the price of Solana was trading for $137.16, up marginally by 0.47% in 24 hours. Although the volatility is yet to clear, SOL has recorded more than 1.2% against Bitcoin within the same period. With the current outlook, the coin has now pared off its price over the past week which has dropped by 21%. SOL Price Historical Trend in March The odds of Solana soaring in the coming month is high, as the coin has historically soared in March. Data from Cryptorank pegs the average growth rate in the price of Solana in March at 32.4%. In March 2021, SOL price jumped by 49%, complemented by a 23.2% rally in 2022. While the coin saw a 3.25% retracement, growth peaked in March 2024 when it skyrocketed by 60.8%. Solana Price Monthly Returns. Source: Cryptorank If historical trends play out again, the coin may pare off its losses over the past month, now pegged at 39.5%. Potential Growth Drivers to Watch With Coinbase’s lawsuit dismissed by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), it implies that the claim Solana is an investment contract no longer holds. Current improving regulations in the country have indirectly placed altcoins in a positive light. With the cases closed and the regulator clarifying that memecoins are not securities, innovators may re-ignite the meme hype. Notably, this marked one of the biggest catalysts that drove the coin’s price to an all-time high above $294. Ultimately, the Solana ETF hype may also continue, pushing the asset into a position for adoption by institutional investors if approved. With Franklin Templeton’s SOL ETF filing submitted to the US SEC, the participation is high, pushing the approval odds higher.

The market just witnessed a seismic event that has the entire crypto sphere buzzing. Leading on-chain analytics platform, CryptoQuant , has reported a jaw-dropping Bitcoin inflow of 6,779 BTC, valued at a staggering $573.6 million, flooding into spot exchanges within a mere hour. This sudden surge has sparked intense speculation – is this a precursor to a major market move, or just whales repositioning their assets? Let’s dive deep into the details of this intriguing development. Unpacking the Massive Bitcoin Inflow: CryptoQuant’s Alert When CryptoQuant , a trusted source for on-chain crypto analytics, raises an alarm, it’s time to pay attention. Their recent report highlights an “unusual” spike in Bitcoin inflow to exchanges. But what exactly does this mean, and why is it significant? Essentially, an inflow of Bitcoin to exchanges typically indicates an intent to sell. Traders move their BTC to exchanges to have it readily available for trading against other cryptocurrencies or fiat currencies. A large, rapid inflow, like the one CryptoQuant detected, can often precede periods of increased selling pressure and potential price volatility. Let’s break down the specifics of this substantial exchange inflow : Total Inflow: 6,779 BTC Value: $573.6 million (at the time of the report) Timeframe: Within one hour Now, let’s look at where this massive wave of Bitcoin landed. Coinbase Dominates the Bitcoin Exchange Inflow The lion’s share of this Bitcoin inflow landed on two prominent platforms: Coinbase Advanced and Coinbase Prime. Coinbase , a leading cryptocurrency exchange known for its institutional and retail client base, absorbed a significant portion of this influx. Here’s the detailed breakdown: Exchange Platform BTC Inflow Percentage Coinbase Advanced 3,355 BTC 49% Coinbase Prime 3,256 BTC 48% Bitstamp 108 BTC 1% Total 6,719 BTC 98% As you can see, Coinbase platforms accounted for a whopping 97% of the total inflow, with Coinbase Advanced and Coinbase Prime receiving nearly equal amounts. Bitstamp received a much smaller fraction. This concentration on Coinbase raises further questions – why Coinbase specifically? And what does it signal for the market? Why is a Large BTC Inflow to Exchanges Significant? Understanding the implications of a large BTC inflow is crucial for navigating the volatile crypto market. Here’s why this kind of movement matters: Potential Selling Pressure: As mentioned earlier, moving BTC to exchanges is often a precursor to selling. A large inflow suggests a significant number of holders might be preparing to liquidate their positions, potentially driving prices down. Market Sentiment Indicator: Sudden spikes in exchange inflow can reflect a shift in market sentiment. It could indicate growing bearishness or profit-taking after a price rally. Volatility Catalyst: Large inflows can inject volatility into the market. The increased supply on exchanges can lead to rapid price swings as traders react to the potential for increased selling pressure. Whale Activity: Such massive transfers are often associated with whale activity – large holders moving substantial amounts of Bitcoin. Tracking these flows can provide insights into whale strategies and potential market manipulation. Are There Alternative Explanations for the Exchange Inflow? While a large BTC inflow often points to selling pressure, it’s important to consider alternative explanations. CryptoQuant itself notes that: “Some of these deposits may be from customers using exchange custody solutions.” This is a crucial point. Here are a few alternative scenarios to consider: Custodial Services Repositioning: Exchanges like Coinbase offer custodial services to institutions and individuals. These entities might be moving funds between different custody solutions or consolidating assets on the exchange for various operational reasons, not necessarily for immediate selling. OTC Desk Transfers: Over-the-counter (OTC) desks often utilize exchanges for settlement. Large inflows could be related to OTC trades being settled on exchanges, which doesn’t always translate to immediate market selling. Internal Exchange Transfers: Exchanges themselves might be moving funds internally between different wallets or platforms for security or operational purposes. These internal movements could be misinterpreted as external inflows if not properly analyzed. Actionable Insights: Navigating Market Volatility So, what should crypto traders and investors make of this Bitcoin inflow ? Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Price Action Closely: Keep a close watch on Bitcoin’s price movement in the coming hours and days. Increased selling pressure could lead to price corrections. Track On-Chain Metrics: Continue to monitor on-chain data from platforms like CryptoQuant for further insights into exchange flows, whale activity, and other market indicators. Manage Risk: In times of potential market volatility, prudent risk management is key. Consider adjusting your portfolio allocations and using risk management tools like stop-loss orders. Stay Informed: Keep yourself updated with the latest market news and analysis from reputable sources to make informed decisions. Conclusion: Decoding the Bitcoin Exchange Inflow Mystery The sudden $573 million Bitcoin inflow to exchanges, as flagged by CryptoQuant , is undoubtedly a noteworthy event in the crypto market. While it could signal potential selling pressure and market volatility, alternative explanations like custodial repositioning and OTC transfers cannot be ruled out. The concentration of this inflow on Coinbase platforms adds another layer of intrigue to this development. As the market digests this information, close monitoring of price action and further on-chain data will be crucial to decipher the true implications of this massive Bitcoin movement.

40932328,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=135131,1740699766,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary Figure AI to Launch Astonishing Home Robot Alpha Testing in 2025,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/figure-ai-home-robot-testing/,"Get ready for a potentially groundbreaking shift in home technology! Figure AI, a robotics startup making waves, has just announced an accelerated timeline for bringing its humanoid robot into our homes. While the crypto world thrives on disruptive innovation, this development from Figure AI signals a tangible leap in robotics that could soon impact our daily lives in astonishing ways. Forget distant dreams of robot butlers – Figure is aiming to start “alpha testing” its Figure 02 humanoid robot in actual home settings as early as 2025. Let’s dive into what this means and why it’s happening sooner than many expected. Why the Accelerated Timeline for Home Robots? The Power of Helix Figure CEO Brett Adcock attributes this faster pace to their innovative “generalist” Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model, aptly named Helix. This sophisticated AI is the real engine behind Figure’s ambitious schedule. Here’s why Helix is a game-changer: Generalist Approach: Unlike narrow AI focused on specific tasks, Helix is designed to be a jack-of-all-trades. It can learn and adapt to a wider range of situations and tasks, crucial for the unpredictable nature of home environments. Vision and Language Fusion: Helix processes both visual data and natural language input. Imagine instructing your home robot with simple voice commands or showing it what needs to be done – Helix bridges the gap between human instruction and robotic action. Rapid Learning: This VLA model is built to accelerate the robot’s learning curve. The faster it can grasp new tasks, the quicker it can become truly useful in a dynamic home setting. This announcement of accelerated alpha testing comes hot on the heels of Figure unveiling Helix itself. The company’s strategic decision to move away from its publicized partnership with OpenAI in favor of proprietary AI models like Helix underscores their commitment to controlling and optimizing their AI foundation. This independence is key to driving innovation and tailoring the AI specifically for their humanoid robot ambitions. Home Sweet Home for Humanoid Robots? Figure’s Vision The idea of home robots isn’t entirely new, but Figure’s concrete timeline brings it closer to reality. We’ve even had glimpses into Figure’s home aspirations, with early lab tests showcased at their South Bay offices. Last week’s Helix reveal further illuminated these plans, showcasing videos of robots tackling various household chores – even food preparation! One particularly interesting aspect is Helix’s design to orchestrate two robots working together on a single task. This hints at a future where multiple humanoid robots might collaborate in our homes to tackle complex tasks more efficiently. Consider these potential home applications: Household Chores: From tidying up and doing laundry to cleaning surfaces and organizing spaces, home robots could alleviate the burden of everyday housework. Meal Preparation: Imagine robots capable of following recipes, preparing ingredients, and even cooking meals, freeing up your time and simplifying daily routines. Assistance for the Elderly: As populations age, humanoid robots could provide invaluable support for older adults, helping them maintain independence at home for longer. This could range from mobility assistance to medication reminders and emergency support. From Factory Floors to Living Rooms: The Robotics Journey While the allure of home robots is strong, the initial focus for most robotics companies, including Figure, has been on industrial applications. Why the detour to factories and warehouses first? Lucrative Industrial Deployment: The immediate financial returns in industrial settings are more attractive. Factories and warehouses offer structured environments where robots can perform repetitive tasks, increasing efficiency and productivity. Controlled Environments: Industrial settings are generally more predictable and safer than homes. This allows for easier testing and deployment of early-stage robotics technology. Willing Early Adopters: Companies like BMW, where Figure is piloting its systems, are willing to invest in testing and implementing robotics solutions to optimize their operations. This industrial phase is seen as a crucial stepping stone. Gaining experience and refining the technology in controlled environments like factories paves the way for the more complex and nuanced challenges of deploying humanoid robots in homes. The Unique Challenges of Home Robotics Bringing robotics into our homes is a different ballgame compared to factories. Homes are wonderfully diverse and, let’s face it, often messy! Here are some key hurdles: Challenge Description Variability: Every home is unique in layout, furniture, lighting, and clutter. Robots need to adapt to endless variations. Unpredictability: Homes are dynamic environments with people, pets, and unexpected events. Robots must navigate unpredictable situations safely and effectively. Affordability: Consumer robotics must be priced competitively to be adopted widely. Balancing advanced capabilities with affordability is crucial. Safety: Home robots must be absolutely safe to operate around humans, children, and pets. Safety protocols and fail-safes are paramount. User Experience: Robots need to be easy to use and integrate seamlessly into daily life. Intuitive interfaces and reliable performance are essential for user adoption. While Figure’s 2025 “ alpha testing ” designation implies very early-stage trials, it’s a significant leap forward. It signals that the era of home robots is inching closer, driven by advancements in AI and the relentless pursuit of innovative companies like Figure AI. What Does This Mean for the Future? Figure’s ambitious timeline for home robots , fueled by their Helix VLA model, is a clear indication of the rapid progress in the field. While widespread adoption is still some years away, the prospect of humanoid robots assisting us in our homes is becoming increasingly tangible. This development has far-reaching implications: Enhanced Quality of Life: Home robots have the potential to free up our time, reduce stress from mundane chores, and provide valuable assistance, especially for the elderly and those with mobility limitations. New Industries and Job Creation: The rise of home robotics will spawn new industries focused on robot development, maintenance, software, and related services, creating new job opportunities. Societal Impact: As robotics becomes more integrated into our lives, it will raise important societal questions about ethics, privacy, and the evolving relationship between humans and machines. Figure AI’s push towards home robots is more than just technological advancement; it’s a glimpse into a future where technology seamlessly integrates into our homes, transforming how we live and interact with our surroundings. Keep an eye on Figure – they might just be shaping the next frontier of domestic life.

Provider Account/Details: You might be redirected to the chosen provider’s interface (or an embedded window) to link your existing account or create a new one. This is where you’ll provide payment details for receiving fiat currency. KYC Verification (if needed): If it’s your first time using the provider or for larger amounts, you might be prompted to complete KYC verification as required by regulations. Confirm and Execute: Review all transaction details, including fees and exchange rates, and confirm the off-ramp transaction within the Uniswap Wallet. Transaction Processing: The chosen provider will process the conversion and initiate the fiat currency transfer to your specified payment method. Processing times vary depending on the provider and payment method. Potential Challenges and Things to Keep in Mind While this update is incredibly positive, it’s important to be aware of potential challenges and considerations: Fees: Off-ramping services always involve fees. Be sure to compare fees across providers and understand the fee structure before initiating a transaction. Fees can include transaction fees, exchange rate markups, and payment processing fees. Regulatory Compliance (KYC/AML): Fiat off-ramping is subject to regulatory scrutiny. Expect to undergo KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) verification processes with the chosen provider. This is a standard practice to comply with financial regulations. Geographic Restrictions: The availability of specific providers and fiat currencies may be limited by geographic location and regulatory restrictions. Confirm that the service is available in your region. Exchange Rate Fluctuations: Cryptocurrency prices are volatile. The exchange rate at the time of initiating the off-ramp transaction might differ slightly from the rate when the transaction is fully processed. Be mindful of potential fluctuations, especially for larger transactions. Security: While Uniswap Wallet is self-custodial, you are still interacting with third-party providers for fiat off-ramping. Ensure you are using reputable providers and practice good security hygiene when managing your accounts and transactions. The Future of DeFi and Fiat Accessibility Uniswap Wallet’s integration of fiat currency exchange is a significant step forward for the DeFi space. It addresses a critical pain point for many users – the often-complex process of moving between the crypto and traditional financial systems. By simplifying crypto to fiat conversions, Uniswap is contributing to: Mainstream Adoption: Making crypto more user-friendly and accessible is crucial for wider adoption. Fiat off-ramping removes a significant barrier for newcomers and casual users. Real-World Utility: This feature enhances the real-world utility of cryptocurrencies. It becomes easier to use crypto earnings for everyday expenses, making them more practical in daily life. DeFi Ecosystem Growth: As DeFi becomes more integrated with traditional finance, it fosters a more robust and interconnected financial ecosystem. Fiat on/off-ramps are essential infrastructure for this growth. Conclusion: Embracing a Seamless Crypto-Fiat Future The introduction of fiat off-ramping in the Uniswap Wallet is a revolutionary development. It marks a significant leap towards bridging the gap between the decentralized world of crypto and the traditional financial system. By partnering with established providers like Robinhood, Transak, and MoonPay, Uniswap is empowering users with unprecedented convenience and control over their crypto assets. This update not only simplifies the user experience but also paves the way for greater mainstream adoption and real-world application of cryptocurrencies. As the DeFi space continues to evolve, features like seamless fiat off-ramping will be instrumental in shaping a more accessible and user-centric financial future.

But don’t worry, this isn’t a retreat, but a bold leap forward! Get ready for TikTok One, a groundbreaking platform supercharged with cutting-edge AI tools , poised to redefine how brands and content creators collaborate. For those in the crypto and blockchain space, understanding these social media evolutions is crucial as marketing strategies increasingly blend with online content creation. Let’s dive into what this powerful transition means for the future of digital engagement. Why is TikTok Replacing the Creator Marketplace with TikTok One? TikTok’s Creator Marketplace, while functional, was somewhat limited in scope. Think of it as a first-generation solution. TikTok One , on the other hand, is envisioned as a comprehensive ecosystem. The move signals TikTok’s ambition to provide a more integrated and intelligent suite of tools for businesses and content creators . Here’s a breakdown of the key reasons behind this upgrade: Enhanced Functionality: Creator Marketplace was primarily a directory to connect brands and creators. TikTok One expands this to offer a broader range of services, including trend analysis, creative inspiration, and AI-driven content creation tools. AI-Powered Intelligence: The core differentiator is the deep integration of artificial intelligence. TikTok One leverages AI to offer intelligent assistance in script generation, video editing, ad optimization, and more – features absent in the original marketplace. Streamlined Workflow: By consolidating various tools and resources into a single platform, TikTok aims to simplify the campaign creation and management process for both brands and creators. Future-Proofing for Social Media Marketing: This move reflects the growing importance of AI in digital marketing. TikTok is positioning itself at the forefront of this evolution, offering tools that are not just current but also future-ready. Essentially, TikTok is moving from a simple matchmaking service to a sophisticated, AI-enhanced creative and social media marketing hub. Unpacking the Power of TikTok One’s AI Tools The real excitement around TikTok One lies in its arsenal of AI tools . These aren’t just gimmicks; they are designed to genuinely enhance the creative process and marketing effectiveness. Let’s explore some of the standout AI-driven features: Symphony Assistant: Your AI Co-Pilot for TikTok Creativity Imagine having an AI assistant specifically tailored for TikTok content creation. That’s precisely what Symphony Assistant offers. This feature helps users: Summarize Trends: Quickly grasp trending topics and themes on TikTok, ensuring your content stays relevant and timely.

Intelligent Ad Optimization: Receive AI-driven suggestions to refine and enhance ad performance, maximizing ROI. Script Generator: Develop TikTok video scripts for ads by simply providing product details, industry information, and other relevant inputs. What Happens to Existing Creator Marketplace Data? TikTok understands the importance of data continuity. Ahead of the Creator Marketplace shutdown, they are actively encouraging advertisers to migrate their valuable data. Here’s what you need to know about the transition process: Data Migration Encouraged: TikTok is urging users to transfer data from the Creator Marketplace and the TikTok Creative Challenge dashboard to TikTok One. Seamless Transition: The goal is to make the migration as smooth as possible, ensuring minimal disruption for ongoing campaigns and creator relationships. Preparation is Key: Advertisers should proactively take steps to migrate their data to ensure they can continue their activities seamlessly on TikTok One. The Benefits of TikTok One for Brands and Creators This transition to TikTok One is packed with potential benefits for both brands and content creators .

Enhanced Creativity: AI assistance can spark new ideas and push creative boundaries, leading to more innovative and impactful campaigns. Improved ROI: Smarter ad optimization and more targeted content creation can translate to better campaign performance and a higher return on investment. Data-Driven Decisions: Access to trend tracking and performance analytics within TikTok One allows for more informed and strategic marketing decisions. For Content Creators: Expanded Opportunities: TikTok One’s broader scope may lead to more diverse and lucrative collaboration opportunities with brands. Creative Empowerment: AI tools can assist creators in refining their content, experimenting with new formats, and enhancing their production quality. Streamlined Collaboration: A centralized platform simplifies the process of connecting with brands, managing campaigns, and accessing resources.

The bill is designed to address ethical concerns over conflicts of interest and the use of public office for personal gain. Although the proposal faces steep political challenges, it sparks a broader debate on transparency and accountability in digital finance. The discussion reflects growing calls for clearer regulatory boundaries in a market where politics and cryptocurrency increasingly intersect. ABC News reported Thursday that House Democrats are preparing new legislation. Led by Congressman Sam Liccardo (D-CA), they plan to introduce the Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement (MEME) Act. The bill would bar senior U.S. officials and their family members from issuing, sponsoring, or endorsing digital assets, securities, futures, and commodities—specifically in response to President Donald Trump’s recent involvement with the $TRUMP meme coin. Details of the MEME Act According to the February 27 report , Liccardo and his Democratic Party constituents plan to introduce the Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement (MEME) Act, which would prohibit top U.S. officials and their family members from profiting off cryptocurrencies. Let’s make corruption criminal again. #SipWithSam #MEMEAct pic.twitter.com/J4sRcMdXv0 — Rep. Sam Liccardo (@RepLiccardo) February 27, 2025 The MEME Act is unlikely to pass in the current Republican-controlled Congress. However, its prospects could improve if Democrats retake control in the 2026 midterm elections, potentially forcing Trump to return any profits from his namesake cryptocurrency. “Let’s make corruption criminal again,” Liccardo told reporter John Parkinson. “Our public offices belong to the public, not the officeholders—nor should they leverage their political authority for financial gain.” “The Trumps’ issuance of meme coins financially exploits the public for personal gain, and raises the specter of insider trading and foreign influence over the Executive Branch,” he added. Donald Trump Faces Meme Coin Criticism The meme coin $TRUMP debuted just days before the U.S. presidential inauguration, launching alongside $MELANIA, a token tied to now-First Lady Melania Trump. Shortly after its release, $TRUMP surged to over $74 before experiencing a sharp decline, mirroring the drop in the value of $MELANIA. According to CoinGecko , $TRUMP is down 82 percent from its all-time high last month, while $MELANIA has fallen by 93 percent. The U.S. President and First Lady have previously launched branded NFTs , continuing their involvement in Web3. Despite Trump’s crypto-friendly regulatory stance, the Trumps’ meme coins have faced criticism online and in political circles due to substantial investor losses. “Last cycle we had NFTs, so Trump sold NFTs. This cycle we have meme coins,” Variant Fund CLO Jake Chervinsky said in a January 2025 X post. “Is $TRUMP seriously a surprise to you?” Restoring Confidence in Public Service Trust in governance depends heavily on separating personal gain from political authority—a line increasingly blurred by crypto-related ventures like $TRUMP. Though Liccardo’s MEME Act faces an uphill battle, its introduction itself highlights a pressing dilemma: How much influence should politicians wield in speculative digital markets? The answer will shape not just cryptocurrency policy but the credibility of democratic institutions. Ultimately, preserving public confidence may require decisive action far beyond symbolic legislation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What ethical concerns does the proposed bill raise? The measure highlights worries about public officials potentially using their office to secure personal financial benefits through digital tokens. Such a mix of public duty and private profit could erode trust in government decision-making and blur the lines of accountability. How might restricting political involvement in meme coins affect the cryptocurrency market? By limiting political figures from endorsing or profiting from meme coins, the proposal could reduce market volatility driven by speculative hype and conflict of interest. However, some observers argue that the impact might be largely symbolic given the challenging legislative environment. Are there alternative approaches to managing conflicts of interest in political finance related to digital assets? Experts suggest that, aside from outright bans, enhanced disclosure requirements and independent oversight mechanisms could offer a path to greater transparency. These alternatives might help ensure that personal financial interests do not compromise public service, fostering a more accountable framework. What potential impact could this legislation have on public trust in government? If elected officials are seen to profit from speculative digital assets, public confidence in their commitment to serving the common good may decline. This concern fuels calls for reform, as maintaining clear boundaries between public duty and personal enrichment is essential for democratic legitimacy. How does this legislative effort fit into the larger context of cryptocurrency regulation? The proposal reflects a broader debate about the need for regulatory clarity in digital markets. By targeting practices that merge political power with speculative investments, the measure may serve as a precursor to more comprehensive rules designed to ensure that emerging financial technologies operate with greater ethical oversight.

A new bill aims to prevent top government officials, including the president, from issuing or endorsing cryptocurrencies, following concerns over the recent decline of the $TRUMP meme coin.

As investors hunt for the next big opportunity, RCOF is positioning itself as a revolutionary force in decentralized finance, offering cutting-edge technology and investor-friendly features that set it apart. The Unmatched Appeal of RCO Finance (RCOF) RCO Finance (RCOF) has captured the attention of seasoned traders and institutional investors thanks to its innovative ecosystem designed for efficiency and profitability. Unlike many other altcoins, RCOF introduces an AI-powered robo advisor that revolutionizes investment strategies. This advanced tool analyzes real-time market trends and applies machine learning to identify high-potential assets before they take off. Its predictive capabilities ensure that RCOF investors stay ahead of the curve, making it one of the top altcoins to hold in the coming months. Beyond AI-driven trading, RCOF offers unparalleled accessibility. The platform’s no-KYC policy ensures privacy-focused transactions, making it a go-to choice for investors who value anonymity. Security remains a top priority, with comprehensive smart contract audits conducted by the reputable blockchain security firm SolidProof.

Investors gain exposure to over 120,000 tradable instruments, including tokenized real-world assets such as real estate, commodities, stocks, and bonds. This diversification allows RCOF holders to mitigate risks while maximizing their investment potential, further solidifying its position as one of the top altcoins to hold in March 2025.

These features make RCO Finance more than just another altcoin; it’s a comprehensive investment solution that caters to both short-term traders and long-term investors. RCOF incorporates deflationary mechanisms designed to enhance its value over time. The platform actively burns unsold tokens during its presale stages, reducing overall supply. This strategic approach boosts long-term price appreciation, making it a standout option among the top altcoins to hold in 2025. Recent developments have only added to RCOF’s momentum. The platform’s beta launch was met with overwhelming enthusiasm, attracting over 10,000 new users. With its upcoming alpha release, RCO Finance plans to introduce additional enhancements, including an advanced monitoring tool for its AI Robo Advisor.

So far, over $13.5 million has been raised, with the next price phase at $0.13 rapidly approaching. Investors who secure their positions now benefit from significant price appreciation upon listing. Market analysts project that RCOF could trade between $0.40 and $0.60 post-listing, presenting an ROI of over 800% for early adopters. Some forecasts even anticipate a 19,000% price surge, elevating RCOF to the ranks of the most profitable altcoins in recent history. Furthermore, RCOF holders gain access to exclusive perks, including AI-powered analytics, DeFi lending services, trading fee discounts, and governance rights within the ecosystem.

There’s a direct line from the efficient markets theory of Eugene Fama in the 1960s to modern portfolio theory. It paved the way for index funds, a strategy that has not only weathered market cycles but also become the default for managing pensions and retirement accounts. As we step into a new era of digital finance, tokenized assets may offer a way to broaden our investment horizons in ways that traditional models have overlooked. The genesis of modern portfolio theory Index fund investing didn’t arise by chance. In the early 1970s, amid vigorous debates over market efficiency, Burton Malkiel’s seminal work advocating index funds in 1973 (in his book “A Random Walk Down Wall Street” ) was embodied in John Bogle’s launch of the Vanguard S&P 500 fund in 1975. This cemented a strategy that focused on broad diversification and minimal trading. Astonishingly, passive index-investing has triumphed around the world, even though the theory underpinning it, that investors are always rational, hasn’t held up well. Behavioral psychologists like Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky illuminated the flaws in our decision-making processes. This is highlighted in Daniel Kahneman’s award winning book, “Thinking Fast and Slow.” In the ensuing decades, economists have reconciled efficient markets and irrational behavior into the concept of “pretty good markets.” Aggregated wisdom in the form of prices trends towards being right, over time, though from day to day and case to case there are significant gaps that investors can exploit. Index funds have held up well because exploiting those opportunities is hard to do consistently or cheaply. At the same time, the regulatory framework governing institutional investing reinforces this reliance on proven strategies. Fund managers operate under strict fiduciary duties that require them to prioritize client interests and mitigate risk. As a result, they allocate the bulk of their portfolios to assets with long, established track records, typically government bonds and passive equity funds. In short, the criteria for “acceptable” investments aren’t driven solely by potential returns; they are fundamentally tied to data history, reliability, and transparency. In case you were wondering, that means index funds. In this environment, venturing into uncharted territory is not taken lightly. New asset classes, no matter how promising, are initially sidelined because they lack the long-term, daily data that makes them viable for inclusion in a fiduciary portfolio. Until now, almost all portfolio theory has been based on U.S. equities and government bonds. Although that universe has expanded over time to include index funds and bonds from other large economies, it still represents only a relatively small portion of the world’s assets. Portfolios are constrained at the intersection of regulations and data. And that’s all going to change. Tokenization: Expanding the universe of investable assets Tokenization and on-chain transactions don’t just offer a scalable way to package any kind of asset. They also offer a path to transparent, comparable data on asset values. By representing real-world assets, whether it’s Thai real estate, Nigerian oil leases, or New York taxi medallions as digital tokens on a blockchain, we can begin to generate the kind of daily, market-derived data that has traditionally been reserved for a narrow set of assets. Consider a simple question: How much Thai real estate should feature in a diversified retirement portfolio? Under current models, the answer is obscured by a lack of reliable, continuous pricing data. But if Thai real estate were tokenized, establishing an on-chain market with daily closing prices, it could eventually be measured against the same metrics used for U.S. equities. In time, this would force a re-examination of the static, index-based approach that has dominated investment strategy for so long. The implications for global finance Right now, alternative strategies – as pension fund managers refer to anything that isn’t a stock or bond index – comprise no more than 15–20% of most funds. Changing academic data on investment options would put the other 80% up for grabs. Imagine a future where a truly diversified portfolio isn’t limited by the confines of traditional equity and debt markets. With tokenization, investors from large institutional funds to individual savers could gain exposure to asset classes and geographic regions previously ignored due to data scarcity or illiquidity. The principles that underpin modern portfolio theory wouldn’t be discarded. Rather, they would be expanded upon to include a broader range of risk and return profiles. As tokenized assets build track records, fiduciaries, who today favor the predictability of bonds and index funds, might find themselves compelled to recalibrate their strategies. It’s not that the pretty good market hypothesis will be rendered obsolete. Instead, the parameters of what constitutes “efficient” may widen considerably. A richer dataset could lead to better-informed risk assessments and, ultimately, to portfolios that capture a more accurate picture of global value. A Measured but inevitable shift This isn’t going to happen overnight. The fastest we’re likely to see changes emerge is about a decade, assuming time to build a wide portfolio of tokenized assets and 5-7 years to build a daily information track record. Once the data is present, however, change could come quickly, thanks to widespread use of artificial intelligence. One thing that often slows the spread of change is a lack of intellectual bandwidth on the part of fund managers and consumers to adapt to new data. It took about 40 years to move pension fund investors from a 95%+ bonds model in the 1950s to a majority equity index fund model in the 1990s. It took about 30 years for index funds to become the dominant equity investment vehicle after the evidence showed they were the best option. In a world of AI-driven automated investment tools, the transition might happen a whole lot faster. And with hundreds of trillions of dollars in assets under management, every percentage point change in allocation strategy is a little tsunami of change by itself.

The feature is facilitated through integrations with MoonPay, Robinhood, and Transak. This development will simplify the conversion of digital assets into fiat currency, improving accessibility for users in over 180 countries. Uniswap Labs Integrates Robinhood, MoonPay for Crypto-to-Bank Transfers In a recent post on X, Uniswap Labs announced the rollout of its fiat off-ramp feature, enabling users to convert crypto holdings into cash and withdraw funds directly into their bank accounts. This service is integrated with Robinhood, MoonPay, and Transak, providing a streamlined process for users looking to move between crypto and traditional finance. The new off-ramp is available in over 180 countries, broadening UNI platform’s global reach. The feature is accessible through the Uniswap wallet on both iOS and Android. More so, there are plans to extend support to the UNI platform browser extension and website. By integrating with multiple fiat on-ramp providers, Uniswap Labs will offer a flexible way for users to manage crypto transfers. Users can swap supported ERC-20 tokens, including USDC and ETH, before withdrawing their converted funds to bank accounts. According to Uniswap, the process is designed to be completed in seconds, reducing delays commonly associated with crypto-to-bank transfers. The integration with Robinhood, MoonPay, and Transak ensures broad coverage across different regions, increasing accessibility. This move comes just days after the US SEC dropped its Uniswap case, marking another shift in the regulator’s approach to the crypto industry. The UNI platform stated that the case closure reaffirms its compliance with federal laws and its commitment to a transparency. Expansion of Features With Unichain The fiat off-ramp follows the UNI platform recent introduction of Uniswap v4 and Unichain, a Layer 2 network designed to improve scalability. These updates will offer users more efficient trading and transaction capabilities. Uniswap v4 introduces customizable hooks, which allow developers to create more efficient trading strategies on the platform. Meanwhile, Unichain Layer 2 is expected to reduce gas fees and improve transaction speeds, boosting UNI price with new technologies. Uniswap Labs move comes as other crypto wallets, such as MetaMask, expand their fiat off-ramp services. MetaMask recently integrated with Transak to support fiat withdrawals across multiple blockchains. This reflects a growing trend among DeFi platforms to bridge the gap between crypto and traditional banking.

However, it faces its toughest challenge amidst falling network activity and a price slump. According to an analyst, Dogecoin experienced a massive 95% drop in active addresses on its network, suggesting a considerable decline in activity.

As Dogecoin’s price starts to recover, its network activity suffered. Crypto expert Ali Martinez notes the decline in the network activity, sharing that the drop in the number of active addresses began three months ago. According to Martinez, the Dogecoin network registered 1,292,770 new active addresses by November 21st, 2024. The number soon surged to 2.4 million active addresses, but this number immediately dropped. Between December 2024 and February 2025, the number of addresses dropped by around 95%. Meanwhile, Dogecoin’s price has declined substantially in the last few days, with holders incurring losses. The popular meme coin is currently trading at $0.2077, a slight improvement from its $0.1977 price a few hours ago. Despite DOGE’s minimal gains, it’s still down from last week’s performance. Drop In Network Activity On February 23rd, it was noted that the network only had 30,815 new addresses, confirming the slide in network activity. The decrease in Dogecoin’s network activity was reflected in its price movement, which dipped from $0.4868 to $0.196. With price dipping and a decline in network activity, many commentators argued it’s a sign of weak demand for Dogecoin. According to one data, there’s a 2.67% decline in the percentage of long-term Dogecoin investors, which means a less accumulation. Also, there’s a drop of 11.81% in mid-term coin holders, meaning they have already exited their positions. Finally, the data indicates a 107.45% increase in short-term holders, which suggests an increase in speculative trading. This information shows that Dogecoin traders are more interested in short-term and speculative trading activities than long-term investment. DOGE is starting its big move!

Whales Buy 530 Million DOGE appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Amid the ongoing bearish price momentum, Dogecoin (DOGE), the largest and most popular meme coin, has been gaining significant attention from crypto enthusiasts due to its notable price drop in recent days. Crypto Whales Buy 530 Million DOGE On February 28, 2025, a prominent crypto expert shared a post on X (formerly Twitter), revealing that during the past three days of DOGE’s price decline, whales have bought the dip, accumulating a significant 530 million DOGE. https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1895217845186724299 DOGE’s on-chain data shows that it has experienced a price drop of over 17% during the period when whales bought the dip. It appears that they began accumulating after the breakdown of the crucial support level at $0.238. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Action and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, DOGE appears bearish but has been consolidating in a tight range near the crucial support level of $0.175 for the past two trading days. Based on recent price action and historical patterns, DOGE still seems bearish and could drop another 15% in the future. Source: Trading View As of now, the asset is trading below the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe, indicating a downtrend. Current Price Momentum and Decline of Open Interest DOGE is currently trading near $0.206 and has experienced a modest price surge of over 1.75% in the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, its trading volume dropped by 30%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors, possibly due to the significant price fluctuations the meme coin has witnessed in recent days. With the bearish market outlook, data from the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass revealed that intraday and derivative traders appear to be abandoning DOGE, as its futures open interest (OI) has dropped to its lowest level in 2025.

The meme coin market is boiling with action, and traders are scrambling to get in before the next explosion. Apu Apustaja (APU) is feeling the heat, dropping 22.29% in the past week, despite a 7.27% increase in trading volume. Meanwhile, Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) is making waves, climbing 10.26% in just seven days, catching the attention of meme coin degens. But the real spotlight is on BTFD Coin (BTFD), where whales are aping in fast thanks to its 90% APY staking rewards and a massive 3650% ROI potential. With a presale tally of $6.21M and over 11,100 holders, BTFD Coin is dominating the meme coin conversation. Let’s break down why this meme-fueled rocket might be the best meme coin to buy today . BTFD Coin (BTFD) – 90% APY Staking and a 3650% ROI Potential Why are investors rushing to grab BTFD before it moons? Simple—this isn’t just another meme coin, it’s a whole movement. The Bulls Squad, now over 11,100 strong, is laser-focused on staking rewards, play-to-earn (P2E) gaming, and a 3650% ROI moonshot. It’s no wonder why BTFD Coin is dominating discussions as the best meme coin to buy today. The 90% APY staking feature is a game-changer. Investors aren’t just holding BTFD; they’re multiplying their stacks at an insane rate. Staking offers passive income, meaning even before the price skyrockets post-listing, holders are raking in rewards. Now, let’s talk numbers. If an investor drops $2,000 into BTFD at the current presale price of $0.00016, they’d be holding 12.5 million BTFD tokens. Once BTFD hits $0.0006 at listing, that bag would be worth $7,500—nearly 4x the investment before even factoring in staking rewards. And if BTFD blasts to its projected $0.006 moon price, that’s a 3650% ROI, turning $2,000 into a jaw-dropping $75,000. It’s easy to secure BTFD before the presale price jumps. Set up MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load it with BNB, ETH, or USDT, and head to the presale page . Enter the amount of BTFD you want, apply the 100% BONUS CODE (LAUNCH100) to double your tokens, confirm the purchase, and boom—you’re officially part of the Bulls Squad. But here’s where it gets even crazier: BTFD skipped Stage 13, burning all unsold tokens. With a tightening supply and skyrocketing demand, this presale is heating up fast. If you’re still on the sidelines, now’s the time to act—this is hands down the best meme coin to buy today. Apu Apustaja (APU) Sees Volume Surge Despite Price Drop Apu Apustaja, the Pepe-variant meme coin, has had a rough week, dropping 22.29%. However, its trading volume has jumped 7.27%, showing that traders are still keeping an eye on it. Despite its price dip, Apu Apustaja has a loyal community of investors who believe in its long-term value. Unlike low-effort meme coins that get rugged, APU’s fully transparent and fairly launched nature has kept holders engaged. With its fair launch philosophy and organic meme appeal, Apu Apustaja remains a wild card in the meme coin space. Whether it bounces back or consolidates further will depend on its next market moves and how its community rallies. Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) Pumps 10.26% and Gains Market Momentum Fartcoin might have started as a joke, but its recent performance is no laughing matter. The coin has seen a 10.26% price surge in just one week, backed by a 0.76% increase in trading volume. Built on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain, Fartcoin has been picking up steam in the DEX space, where traders are swapping it aggressively. Some early adopters are already seeing solid gains, making it one of the most talked-about meme coins this week. Fartcoin’s real strength lies in its growing trader base and memetic power. As long as it keeps its momentum, it could remain a trending pick for meme coin degens looking for short-term flips. The Final Thoughts Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin stands out as the best meme coin to buy today. While Apu Apustaja battles price volatility and Fartcoin gains short-term traction, BTFD’s 90% APY staking and 3650% ROI potential make it the most compelling investment opportunity right now. The Stage 14 price of $0.00016 won’t last much longer, and with BTFD set to list at $0.0006, this is the perfect dip to buy before it takes off. The 100% BONUS CODE (LAUNCH100) won’t be around forever—this is a limited-time chance to double your tokens and secure a front-row seat for BTFD’s moon mission.

Founding members of HumanAIx include: OORT, Neo, Storj, Oasis Protocol, YGG, io.net, XYO, AI.KIDO, DeTaSECURE, Unyt, Holo, Valdi, Supermoon. As AI advances rapidly, the three core pillars of AI development—compute, storage, and data—continue to face significant challenges including high costs, energy consumption, scalability limitations, and centralization, which restrict accessibility and efficiency. On the storage side, handling large data volumes and associated transfer costs continues to be a challenge. Meanwhile, data acquisition often raises ethical and legal concerns, with frequent violations of privacy rights. Data labeling further exacerbates the issue, relying on underpaid workers in poor working conditions, creating serious human rights concerns. Additionally, individuals who contribute data rarely receive fair compensation or incentives. Overcoming these challenges is important for the industry's long-term sustainability and ethical development. HumanAIx is an open protocol that seamlessly connects partners—each contributing critical components such as validation, storage, compute, and data—to create a decentralized AI infrastructure that is permissionless, scalable, and verifiable. It is built on a three-layer architecture, consisting of an interface layer, a protocol layer (which integrates compute, storage, and data), and a security layer. This initiative harnesses industry expertise and knowledge to collaboratively build an open environment for the future of decentralized AI. ""We believe AI should create more benefits than constraints for humanity. With the launch of HumanAIx, we are fostering a decentralized movement to ensure AI remains human-centric and serves the broader community,"" said Michael Robinson, Chairman of OORT Foundation. ""We are thrilled to collaborate with like-minded visionaries and excited to develop initiatives that better serve the AI community, ultimately building a truly human-centric ecosystem."" ""At Neo, we believe that a decentralized, interoperable future is key to unlocking AI’s full potential. By joining HumanAIx, we are contributing to an open, verifiable AI infrastructure that empowers developers and businesses alike—one that is transparent, scalable, and accessible to all,"" said John Wang, Head of Neo Ecosystem Growth. “This HumanAIx marks a significant milestone in democratising access to high-quality AI models and incentivising human contribution in AI. By combining OORT’s robust infrastructure with our security expertise at DeTaSECURE and EigenLayer’s innovative restaking mechanism, we’re creating an ecosystem that ensures transparency, reliability and economic sustainability in AI industry.”said Tamaghna Basu, Founder, CEO & CTO of DeTaSECURE. ""The future of AI depends on diverse, high-quality human input, and YGG is joining HumanAIx to ensure that AI is built with—and for—real people. By empowering a global community to refine and enhance AI data in a decentralized way, we’re creating new opportunities for digital work while keeping AI open, fair, and aligned with human interests."" said Beryl Li, Co-Founder of YGG. ""At XYO, we are driven by the vision of blending blockchain, data and AI to unlock human potential in meaningful ways. HumanAIx offers a unique opportunity to foster collaboration and build systems that prioritize fairness, authenticity, and real-world impact while ensuring data integrity. We’re proud to join forces with forward-thinking partners to shape a future where technology amplifies human agency and innovation thrives."" said Markus Levin, XYO Co-Founder. “While everyone is just talking about ‘Bring AI to people’, ‘Make Web3 AI truly decentralized’, HumanAIx has a real impact by uniting the brightest minds of the web3 AI sector. By stepping into this alliance with AI.KIDO we're significantly boosting our efforts to put the responsibility for AI markets into the hands of real people.” said Pavlo Karapinka, Co-Founder of AI.KIDO. “We are impressed with the collaborative and human-centric approach to AI taken by HumanAIx. It’s imperative that AI develops as a tool for all and by all, and this initiative is a unique opportunity to make this goal a reality. We are excited to work closely with our partners to build and realise the vision of this open ecosystem.” said Alastair Ong, Director at Holo.

While institutional investors are increasingly backing Bitcoin, not every investor is focused solely on BTC for substantial returns. Yet, not all investors are focusing on BTC— Web3Bay is quickly becoming the center of attention. While Bitcoin leads the market, Web3Bay’s rise is stealing the spotlight. The decentralized e-commerce platform raised $200,000 within 24 hours, marking a milestone in its presale. With rapid sales and a unique Web3 model, Web3Bay stands out as one of the top altcoins to buy now, showing massive potential in 2025. Bitcoin’s Gains Strength With Strategy₿’s Bullish Bet Bitcoin’s jump above $95,000 marks a solid comeback after losses caused by the LIBRA coin crash, which erased $4.4 billion in market value. Despite setbacks, Bitcoin remains the strongest crypto, with institutions rapidly increasing their holdings. On February 18, 2025, Michael Saylor, executive chairman of Strategy₿ (formerly MicroStrategy), revealed the company’s $2 billion private offering. Raised through convertible senior notes due in 2030, the funds will buy more Bitcoin and support long-term growth. Saylor highlighted Bitcoin’s growing role in corporate finance, comparing its value to high-end real estate. He noted that Bitcoin is no longer just a speculative asset but a core part of Strategy₿’s expansion strategy, even using BTC as collateral for new projects. With institutions strengthening their Bitcoin positions, analysts see this as a signal of long-term growth, suggesting that the current dip offers a chance to buy. However, as Bitcoin’s growth slows, many retail investors are turning to Web3Bay for faster gains. Web3Bay Raises $200K in 24 Hours— Is it the Next Market Giant? While Bitcoin rebounds, Web3Bay is capturing attention with its rapid growth. The decentralized e-commerce platform raised over $200,000 in a single day, pushing its presale total past $1.5 million as buyers rush to secure early-stage gains. Web3Bay aims to transform online shopping by cutting out middlemen, lowering costs, and giving users full control over their transactions. Unlike Amazon, eBay, and Shopify, which charge high fees and control user data, Web3Bay offers direct blockchain-based transactions. This real-world use case is fueling Web3Bay’s fast-selling presale. As interest in decentralized commerce grows, Web3Bay is positioned to lead the market. Now in Stage 4 of its presale, the 3BAY coin is priced at $0.004562. With each stage bringing a price increase, early buyers are locking in gains before the next jump. The rising demand and fast funding suggest Web3Bay could become one of the biggest success stories of the next bull run. Why Smart Investors Are Choosing Web3Bay Bitcoin remains a strong choice for long-term growth, but its large market cap limits its speed. While institutional adoption boosts its stability, it doesn’t offer the rapid gains that retail investors seek. This is why many are turning to Web3Bay, which offers both real-world use and high early-stage growth potential. First, Web3Bay’s presale gives buyers a chance to enter at low prices before demand drives up the cost. Unlike Bitcoin, which has already reached a trillion-dollar market cap, Web3Bay is still in its growth phase, offering more room for fast gains. Second, Web3Bay is solving real industry challenges, unlike short-lived meme coins. With more people seeking decentralized shopping, demand for 3BAY coins is expected to rise as the platform grows. Lastly, Bitcoin’s biggest gains are in the past, while Web3Bay is just beginning. Early Bitcoin buyers made life-changing profits, and Web3Bay now offers a similar early-stage opportunity. Time to Take Decision! Bitcoin’s rebound and Strategy₿’s $2 billion purchase show that institutional support for crypto is still strong. But for faster short-term gains, Web3Bay is emerging as a top choice. With $200,000 raised in 24 hours and a presale total above $1.5 million, Web3Bay is growing faster than most new projects in 2025. While Bitcoin is well-established, Web3Bay’s early phase gives buyers the best chance to lock in big returns before prices climb further. The next breakout crypto is here—get in before Web3Bay’s crypto presale stages sell out.

40934881,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=320395,1740704441,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/dailyhodl.png,Economist Alex Krüger Says Current Bitcoin Setup Looking Like Replica of Early 2024 – Here’s His Forecast,https://dailyhodl.com/2025/02/27/economist-alex-kruger-says-current-bitcoin-setup-looking-like-replica-of-early-2024-heres-his-forecast/,"A closely followed economist thinks that Bitcoin ( BTC ) may be repeating a similar pattern from last year and still has room to run to the upside. Alex Krüger tells his 206,800 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin’s latest severe correction is similar to when the flagship crypto asset collapsed to range lows in April 2024 before printing a series of rallies. However, he warns that the uncertainty around US President Donald Trump’s tariff polices remains a big risk for the crypto markets. “The dominant mood across crypto market participants is ‘it is over.’ For good reason. The Bitcoin dip is large, yet not extraordinary. But across alts the destruction is real. That said, I see this BTC chart as a replica of early 2024. Range lows are meant to be taken out (check the early 2024 range). Do need the Donald not to nuke us. The trigger for the last move down was precisely tariffs news (on Canada and Mexico).” Krüger also says Bitcoin may still hit lower price targets before rallying. “BTC is bottom of the range, akin to April 30th, 2024 in my opinion. Maybe we go lower, maybe we bounce. Don’t know, but it’s a good spot regardless.” He notes that severe Bitcoin corrections occur multiple times a year, and may present buying opportunities. “One can make a living just from getting good at buying liquidations. We get two-four such liquidations a year.” The economist previously said that investors should zoom out because he thinks crypto is amid a supercycle, which could include painful Bitcoin pullbacks. “BTC is stuck in a range, which I think eventually resolves higher. The supercycle theory is intact. Even though it applies to Bitcoin and crypto as a whole (market cap ex BTC and stables is considerably higher), most old alts don’t benefit from it on a sustained basis. Should not expect an insane wave of liquidity driving all cr*p higher for an extended period of time. Be selective.” Bitcoin is trading for $84,608 at time of writing, down 4.8% in the last 24 hours.

With major coins experiencing sharp declines, traders are now eyeing emerging projects that could offer substantial returns. The question is, where should one place their bets? Dogecoin (DOGE) has dropped significantly, shaking investor confidence, while Pepe Coin is struggling with high volatility. But amidst the downturn, one memecoin is making waves— Arctic Pablo Coin (APC). With a powerful presale structure, strong tokenomics, and a growing community, APC is positioning itself as the best crypto to buy now. This article will cover the latest developments in Arctic Pablo Coin (APC), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Pepe Coin (PEPE). Arctic Pablo Coin: The Strategic Tokenomics Powering Its Rise Tokenomics is the backbone of any cryptocurrency, and for Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC), it’s a game-changer. With a total supply of 221.2 billion APC, its structure is designed for long-term value and sustainability. The presale allocation rewards early adopters, while unsold tokens are strategically burned, ensuring supply control and potential price appreciation. Staking rewards are another major highlight, incentivizing holders to participate actively. This structure is not just about speculation—it’s about building a lasting ecosystem that thrives beyond the initial hype. Arctic Pablo Coin’s best crypto to buy now status comes from its carefully crafted supply model, ensuring that early investors benefit from controlled distribution and strategic growth mechanisms. Penguinopolis: The Arctic Pablo Presale is Entering an Exciting Phase! The Arctic Pablo Coin presale has reached Penguinopolis, the 12th phase, and the excitement is undeniable. Currently priced at $0.000067 per APC, early investors are looking at a potential 11,844.78% ROI when it hits the listing price of $0.008. With over $1.62 million already raised, the momentum is building rapidly. Each new phase marks a price increase, meaning every delay could mean missing out on massive potential gains. Penguinopolis isn’t just a stop—it’s a crucial turning point for those looking to enter at an optimal price. As the price continues its upward trajectory, those who act now could secure one of the most lucrative opportunities in the meme coin space. For anyone looking for the best crypto to buy now, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale offers a rare chance to get in before it reaches the mainstream spotlight. Dogecoin Faces a Steep Decline—Investors Seek Alternatives Dogecoin (DOGE) is experiencing a significant downturn, leaving investors uncertain about its future. Currently down nearly 40% this month, DOGE has slipped to $0.208 as of February 26—its lowest point since December. The downturn is driven by waning interest and the overall market slump, particularly Bitcoin’s recent dip below $90,000, dragging down altcoins like DOGE. Analysts warn that if the trend continues, DOGE could see further declines, possibly touching $0.20. With a negative sentiment surrounding its price action, many investors are exploring new projects that could deliver better returns. Pepe Coin: A Rapid Rise, But Can It Sustain the Momentum? Pepe Coin has been a sensation in the meme coin world, quickly climbing to a $1.6 billion market cap shortly after launch. With its strong community and meme-driven appeal, it initially seemed unstoppable. However, the typical challenges of meme coins—high volatility, lack of utility, and weak adoption—are now catching up with it. Experts predict that Pepe’s price, currently at $0.000009, could decline soon as investor sentiment shifts. Pepe Coin’s long-term viability remains uncertain with traders looking for projects with stronger fundamentals. As a result, some investors are already exploring newer, more structured opportunities in the meme coin space. Conclusion: The Memecoin Market is Changing—Arctic Pablo Coin Leads the Charge With Dogecoin struggling and Pepe facing uncertain prospects, the memecoin market is in flux. But instead of signaling the end, this shift presents a golden opportunity for new projects to take center stage. Arctic Pablo meme coin presale , currently at Penguinopolis with a price of $0.000067, stands out as a prime investment. With strategic tokenomics, staking incentives, and a growing community, APC is shaping up to be the best crypto to buy now. Don’t wait until it’s too late—Arctic Pablo Coin’s journey is just beginning, and those who get in now could see exponential gains. For More Information: Arctic Pablo Coin: https://www.arcticpablo.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/ArcticPabloOfficial Twitter: https://x.com/arcticpabloHQ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What makes Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) the best crypto to buy now? Arctic Pablo Coin offers a structured presale, strategic tokenomics, and strong staking incentives, making it a standout investment. With its price currently at $0.000067 in the Penguinopolis phase, early investors can secure high potential returns. How does Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale work? The APC presale moves through multiple phases, with each phase increasing the price. The current phase, Penguinopolis, marks one of the last low-price opportunities before the final listing at $0.008. Why is Dogecoin struggling in 2025? Dogecoin has seen a nearly 40% drop this month due to declining trader interest and a general market downturn. Its lack of strong fundamentals is causing investors to look for alternative meme coin opportunities. Is Pepe Coin still a good investment? Pepe Coin gained massive popularity but faces high volatility and no clear long-term adoption. With its price currently at $0.000009, experts predict it could drop further, prompting investors to seek projects with more structured growth potential. How high can Arctic Pablo Coin go after its presale? Based on its listing price of $0.008, early investors in the current Penguinopolis phase at $0.000067 could see an ROI exceeding 11,844.78%. Its staking rewards and controlled supply model further support strong post-listing performance.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $4.66 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $14.78. Tezos started out really strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Following the November 5 U.S. elections and the emergence of ex-president Donald Trump, crypto markets have responded positively, with Bitcoin prices moving above the $100k mark. Tezos also responded similarly, hitting a high of $1.85. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $0.752 Market cap $776,038,568.52 Trading volume $24,372,160.31 Circulating supply 1,032,312,440.52 XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3146 on December 7, 2018 24-hour low $0.7414 24-hour high $0.7853 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 9.54% 50-day SMA $1.044 14-Day RSI 29.66 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 10 (Extreme Fear) Green days 15/30 (50%) 200-day SMA $0.9629 Tezos price analysis: Will XTZ surge past $0.85 soon? TL; DR Breakdown XTZ has lost 0.70% in the last 24 hours. The coin’s support is at $0.748, and resistance is around $0.792. Tezos faced rejection at $0.787. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart: XTZ to surge past its 20-day SMA soon? The daily price analysis of the Tezos (XTZ) coin on February 28 shows consolidation in the last trading hours. XTZ’s value is currently around $0.75, having faced rejection at $0.787. XTZ to surge past its 20-day SMA soon? The MACD indicator, with a bearish crossover, also confirms the selling signal observed on the chart. The RSI (36.28) reflects a market approaching oversold conditions, suggesting buying opportunities at a discount. If buyers reenter the market, XTZ could surge past its 20-day SMA at $0.856. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart: XTZ appears range-bound The 4-hour chart shows recovery for XTZ, with the coin approaching the middle Bollinger Band, although resistance remains intact at $0.770. The Bollinger Bands are tightening, suggesting reduced potential volatility in the short term and possible price consolidation. XTZ appears range-bound The CMF indicator hovering around zero shows a neutral market, supporting the chances of XTZ consolidating. Meanwhile, the MFI also suggests oversold conditions, indicating ongoing cash outflow. If XTZ fails to stay above $0.748, it might move toward lower support levels. To confirm a recovery, XTZ must break above $0.770. Tezos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.9468 SELL SMA 5 $0.9123 SELL SMA 10 $0.9240 SELL SMA 21 $0.9018 SELL SMA 50 $1.0443 SELL SMA 100 $1.2125 SELL SMA 200 $0.9629 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.9246 SELL EMA 5 $0.9980 SELL EMA 10 $1.1126 SELL EMA 21 $1.2210 SELL EMA 50 $1.2529 SELL EMA 100 $1.1481 SELL EMA 200 $1.0276 SELL What to expect from XTZ price analysis next? Tezos (XTZ) is down to about $0.756 and looks oversold, which might mean a short-term bounce. But overall, it’s still in a bearish trend. If it breaks above $1.25, it could turn bullish, but if not, it might keep dropping. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs – so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your own research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Why is Tezos down? Tezos (XTZ) is down today after facing rejection at the $0.7616 resistance level, a move spurred by selloffs. XTZ price history Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $2 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications.

Tezos historic price sentiment Tezos price history ⏐ Source: Coinmarketcap Tezos mainnet went live in September 2018 and immediately gained popularity for dealing with the environmental impact of blockchain technologies at that time with its PoS model. XTZ’s price peaked during the bullish cycle of 2021, reaching above $9.0. After 4 April 2022, XTZ’s price plummeted below $4.0; by 9 May, it had sharply fallen below the $2 mark. XTZ surged to about $1 at the beginning of December 2022, but the bears reclaimed the market by the end of the month, resulting in a drop to $0.73. The coin made some recovery in 2023, averaging a market price of $0.8. Tezos (XTZ) had a largely bearish 2024 despite the partnership milestones achieved. The coin reached a high of $1.4 in April but lost about 60% by August. The bulls soon entered the market, and XTZ saw renewed buyer interest, which resulted in a peak price of $0.7015 in September and $1.856 in November. The surge extended into December—Tezos XTZ recorded a maximum price of $1.909. Price corrections followed thereafter, and the coin closed the year at $1.286. In January 2025, XTZ reached a maximum price of $1.49, but in February, it’s in the red zone, trading between $0.7414 and $0.7853.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,TRADING|XTZ|BUSINESS|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|FORKS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-28 01:30:55

Stripe bets big on stablecoins to transform payments This stance aligns with Stripe’s strategic moves, including its $1.1 billion acquisition of stablecoin startup Bridge in October. However, given that the company handles transactions equivalent to approximately 1% of global GDP, it’s worth exploring why co-founders Patrick and John Collison are betting on blockchain technology. According to their annual letter, the Collison brothers argued that stablecoins represent an “improvement” on the “basic usability of money,” much in the same way that banknotes were an advancement from coins and—perhaps more controversially among The Block readers—fiat currency was an upgrade from the gold standard. Stripe founders believe that stablecoins have four important properties relative to the status quo: They make money movement cheaper and faster, they are decentralized and open-access (and thus globally available from day one), and they are programmable. To be precise, fiat-pegged cryptocurrencies enhance traditional monetary functions and open new avenues for using money. “Improvements to the basic usability of money make economies more prosperous,” the Collison brothers write. Stripe’s stance on crypto has evolved over time. The company famously halted Bitcoin payments in 2018 after just a few years, citing blockchain limitations at the time. However, after a four-year hiatus, Stripe re-entered the crypto space by enabling payouts in USDC—a move that expanded two years later to allow customers to accept stablecoin payments on Solana, Ethereum, and Polygon. While the move may have been influenced by competitors like PayPal and Visa embracing crypto payments, the Collison brothers maintained that the industry’s maturation drove the decision—faster transaction speeds, lower costs, and stablecoins delivering “real utility.” The Stripe co-founders emphasized that years of research and careful systems engineering were required for decentralized technologies to become competitive with traditional financial infrastructure. According to their letter, the conditions for widespread stablecoin adoption have only recently come together. Stablecoins reshape the future of digital transactions The Collison brothers highlight that stablecoin transaction volumes more than doubled between Q4 2023 and Q4 2024, with over 40 million monthly active wallets now in use. They point out that stablecoins are increasingly used for real-world applications, including corporate treasury management, remittances, savings in countries with volatile currencies, and enabling payments in regions with low card penetration. Just as the Stripe co-founders credit much of the company’s success to their early investment in AI solutions, they believe that establishing a leadership position in stablecoin services could fuel Stripe’s next growth phase. While stablecoins are a win-win for Stripe and its client base, they also largely benefit the US government, as many stablecoin advocates have argued. Not only are nearly all stablecoins denominated in the U.S. dollar — strengthening the greenback’s economic hegemony — but issuers like Tether and Circle are among the largest buyers of U.S. government debt due to their need for low-risk treasury assets. As of the end of 2024, Tether has direct and indirect exposure to $113 billion in US government debt. According to Treasury Department data , if it were a nation-state, it would rank as the 19th-largest holder of U.S. Treasury bills. The Collison brothers believe that stablecoins, functioning as a more user-friendly and accessible version of eurodollars, have the potential to deliver similar benefits to a much wider range of participants. However, the subtitle of the stablecoin section in Stripe’s annual letter likened the asset class to “room-temperature semiconductors”—a groundbreaking innovation that, while theorized to be transformative, has yet to become a reality.

A dubious meeting app called ‘GrassCall’ was recently used to spread malware that drains the user’s crypto wallets. The fraud is allegedly carried out by a Russian hacker team known as “Crazy Evil.” This group of cybercriminals specializes in social engineering attacks that trick users into installing infected software on their Mac and Windows PCs. Crazy Evil commonly targets people in the crypto space, where they promote fake job opportunities and games via various social media websites. A cybersecurity company, Recorded Future , said that it has connected “over ten active scams on social media” to Crazy Evil. Hackers posted fake jobs for a sham company called ChainSeeker.io More recently, reports of another fake scam company surfaced. This time, the company was called ChainSeeker.io, according to an X user . According to the reports , threat actors created fake company profiles for ChainSeeker.io on LinkedIn, where they have been sending out premium job listings. Other popular job boards where the fake listing was spotted include CryptoJobList, and WellFound. Job listings by ChainSeeker (Source: choykwok on X) All those who applied for the jobs were contacted via email, which instructed them to contact the company’s marketing chief on Telegram. Scam emails sent out by ChainSeeker to all job applicants (Source: choykwok on X) The chief would then request the user download a video calling app named ‘GrassCall’ from a now-deleted website. Depending on the user’s browser, the website would offer them a Mac or Windows client. A screenshot of the since-flagged website of the malicious app (Source: BleepingComputer) After downloading the app, users are asked to enter a code shared by the CMO in the Telegram chat. The website then either provides a Mac “GrassCall_v.6.10.dmg” [VirusTotal] client or a Windows “GrassCall.exe” client [VirusTotal] client. Once the correct code is entered, both apps install an info stealer, like Rhadamanthys (on Windows), remote access trojans (RATs), or other malware. On Macs, the Atomic (AMOS) Stealer malware gets installed. Scammer providing GrassCall code to a potential victim (Source: choykwok on X) Once installed, the virus collects wallet addresses, authentication cookies, and passwords stored in the online browser and Apple Keychain. The stolen information gets uploaded to a server and gets posted on Telegram channels owned by the malicious actors. If a wallet is found, the hackers use a brute force method to crack the passwords and drain the user’s assets. From these assets, the hackers pay out the user who made the unsuspecting victim download the malicious app. According to publicly released payment information, Crazy Evil members apparently earn tens of thousands of dollars per victim. Crazy Evil’s Telegram channel showings its earnings per user (Source: G0njxa on X) Various users have recounted their experiences after applying to such scam job postings. Cristian Ghita, a LinkedIn user , posted on the platform, “It looked legit from almost all angles. Even the video-conferencing tool had an almost believable online presence.” The hackers have reportedly moved on to a social engineering new campaign Cybersecurity researcher, Gonjxa , has also identified dubious meeting apps called Gatherum, and VibeCall. Gatherum was used in previous campaign by a subgroup of Crazy Evil called “Kevland.” Interestingly, both apps’ branding is pretty much identical to GrassCall. Now, the scammers have moved on to their new campaign with VibeCall, which is currently being circulated among Web3 job seekers. In response to the attention this attack received online, Chain Seeker’s job postings have now reportedly been taken down by most of the job boards. Chainseeker.io website is now flagged in community databases LinkedIn search results do not return any job posts linked to Chainseeker.io anymore. At the same time, its website has been flagged in community databases for being suspicious. Furthermore, LinkedIn accounts of the company’s employees have all been deleted. Users who have already interacted with scammers or installed suspicious apps on their devices are advised to change their passwords and authentication tokens and move their crypto to fresh wallets as a precautionary measure. It is also recommended to turn on two-factor authentication via an authentication app on all websites that support this feature.

SHIB is currently trading near $0.0000143 and has recorded a modest price increase of over 0.50% in the past 24 hours. However, the meme coin has lost more than 22% of its value over the past 30 days. SHIB Price Action and Upcoming Level With this significant price drop, SHIB has recently retested a crucial support level at $0.000013, which has historically acted as a rebound zone. According to expert technical analysis, SHIB appears bearish and could decline by 20% in the coming days. This bearish outlook is driven by the prevailing negative market sentiment and the formation of a doji candle at the $0.000015 resistance level.

Why Investors Expect 6,000% Growth for MUTM",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/a-new-solana-at-just-0-015-why-investors-expect-6000-growth-for-mutm/,"The search for the next major crypto opportunity has led investors to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a decentralized lending protocol with strong fundamentals and real financial utility. While speculative assets rise and fall on hype, MUTM is positioning itself as a sustainable DeFi platform with an actual use case—allowing users to lend, borrow, and earn passive income. With its presale price at just $0.015, many investors see this as a chance to secure tokens at the lowest possible valuation before demand drives prices higher. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance offers a structured lending and borrowing model that is advantageous to both institutional and individual investors, in contrast to projects that just rely on speculation. Users can deposit their cryptocurrency assets into liquidity pools and get incentives depending on usage rates through peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending. However, by offering overcollateralized loans, borrowers can obtain money without having to liquidate their possessions. This process strengthens the token’s long-term worth by generating an ongoing demand cycle. Mutuum Finance also uses mtTokens, which are deposited assets that gradually earn income. When a user contributes Ethereum to the network, for instance, they earn mtETH, which automatically rises in value as interest accrues. This approach is a desirable substitute for conventional staking models since it provides a consistent flow of passive revenue. Presale Success and Price Growth Expectations The rapid momentum of Mutuum Finance’s presale is another strong indicator of investor confidence. In just a short time, over $1.5 million has been raised, with nearly 3,000 investors securing their stake in the project. With a launch price set at $0.06, early buyers are already positioned for a 400% gain before the token even hits exchanges. However, analysts predict that due to increasing adoption, utility-driven demand, and planned exchange listings, MUTM could see price levels exceeding $0.90 or higher, delivering the projected 6,000% growth over time. For instance, an investor would acquire 146,666 MUTM tokens if they invested $2,200 at a price of $0.015 per during the presale. Their investment would yield a 60x return, or $132,000, if the price hits $0.90. Given the strong fundamentals supporting this possibility, it’s simple to understand why early investors are rushing in. To support long-term value appreciation, Mutuum Finance implements a buy-and-distribute mechanism. A portion of platform revenue is used to buy back MUTM tokens, creating continuous buying pressure in the market. These tokens are then distributed to suppliers and liquidity providers, encouraging long-term holding while simultaneously reducing sell pressure. As more users engage with the platform, this system strengthens the token’s stability and overall growth potential. Another major catalyst for Mutuum Finance is its overcollateralized stablecoin, which will be introduced as part of the lending protocol. Mutuum’s stablecoin will be supported by on-chain collateral, guaranteeing security and transparency in contrast to centralized stablecoins that depend on currency reserves. In order to increase liquidity and preserve a solid peg to its value, borrowers will be able to mint the stablecoin against the assets they have deposited. Mutuum’s ecosystem is further improved by this innovation, which draws additional customers to its loan platform. Investors can win free MUTM tokens as part of a $100,000 promotion being held by Mutuum Finance. The goal of this campaign is to incentivize early backers and encourage more participation as the presale picks up steam. Complete information and eligibility requirements are accessible on the official website, where participants can enter by following easy instructions. With the presale gaining momentum and institutional interest growing, many believe that MUTM could be the next major player in DeFi lending. As it approaches launch, the time to enter at the lowest possible price is now, before it follows the trajectory of other successful DeFi projects and skyrockets in value.

Part of Metamask's revamped roadmap includes adding smart contract capabilities to its current wallet. At the moment, MetaMask is an Externally Owned Account (EOA), a type of wallet that is controlled by a public and a private key. One of the main downfalls with EOAs is that it is subject to human error, meaning if you forget your private key, you lose your crypto holdings in that account forever. The other type of wallet that exists on Ethereum are Contract Accounts (CAs), which are controlled by code and have recovery mechanisms in place and security checks for verifying transactions. In a blog post shared during ETHDenver, the largest North American Ethereum conference, the MetaMask team said “smart-contract-based accounts allow us to solve a number of problems: allowing new powerful uses of the assets you hold, while simultaneously improving security. When the user defines their terms from their own programmable account, we greatly expand how the user expresses their agency in ways that are enforced by their own code.” One of those new features aimed at making the user experience on MetaMask easier include ERC-5792, which builds on its current feature, smart transactions . Under ERC-5792, or known as batched transactions, users can combine certain steps when it comes to signing off transactions, like “approve + swap” in one click, meaning that they would save time and gas fees by batching those steps together. Dan Finlay, the co-founder of MetaMask, told CoinDesk that batching transactions “give us all the things you're going to ask for in order, we'll present them to the user in a nice, unified way. The user will pay for one gas fee for the series of events and then it'll just be one block for the whole series of operations.” MetaMask card The MetaMask team also shared that its MetaMask debit card will be available in select states in the U.S. starting mid-March. The card has been in production for a few months and was initially available just to users in the UK and EU. It connects to a user’s MetaMask wallet, letting them spend their crypto. “You can be earning staking rewards or yield on your favorite protocol with your favorite tokens and have those funds available to spend anywhere that Mastercard is accepted with just a tap,” the team wrote in a blogpost. More support As part of the theme of making the user-experience easier, the MetaMask team will be adding support for Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL) in its wallets, meaning users can hold their various crypto assets in one place. “So these are simultaneously delivering some of the most popular blockchains, but, but they're also ensuring that we have smoothed out every part of our interface that allows new blockchains to be added seamlessly,” Finlay said in the interview.

Bitcoin MVRV Z-Score Has Plunged Under Its 365-Day MA In a new post on X, CryptoQuant Head of Research Julio Moreno has talked about why Bitcoin may not have reached a bottom yet. “All valuation metrics are in correction territory,” notes the analyst. “It can take more time.” Related Reading: XRP Indicator Reliable Since 2022 Now Gives This Signal An indicator that Moreno has cited as an example of this trend is the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Z-Score. This metric basically tells us about how the market cap of the asset compares against its realized cap. The “realized cap” is an on-chain capitalization model that calculates the total value of the BTC supply by assuming that each token in circulation has its ‘true’ value equal to the spot price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain. In other words, the realized cap sums up the cost basis of the cryptocurrency’s supply. As such, the model can be interpreted as a measure of the total amount of capital the investors as a whole have put into BTC. Since the MVRV Z-Score compares the market cap, which represents the value the investors are holding right now, against this initial investment, it tells us about the profit-loss status of the cryptocurrency’s user base. The MVRV Z-Score is similar to the popular MVRV Ratio, but where it differs from the latter is that it also applies a standard deviation test to pull out the extremes from the data. Now, here is the chart shared by Moreno that shows the trend in the Bitcoin MVRV Z-Score, as well as its 365-day moving average (MA), over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin MVRV Z-Score has recently witnessed a sharp decline. The reason for this drawdown naturally lies in the crash that the asset’s price has just gone through, which has put many investors into a state of loss. Despite the plummet, though, the metric remains above the zero mark. Below this level, the overall market enters into a state of loss, so the boundary has historically proven to be an important one for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mega Whales The Primary Sellers During Price Crash, Analytics Firm Reveals An important level that the metric has indeed lost, however, is the 365-day MA. As the analyst has highlighted in the chart, past breakdowns of the line have generally led to notable periods of struggle for the Bitcoin price. It only remains to be seen how long BTC would have to stay under the level this time around, before its price reaches a bottom. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $86,300, down more than 11% over the last seven days.

Web3Bay is transforming online shopping by removing intermediaries, creating a marketplace where transactions are directly between buyers and sellers, and maintaining complete autonomy. Unlike conventional platforms burdened with hefty fees and restrictive data policies, Web3Bay utilizes smart contracts for transactions that are secure and transparent. While Chainlink and Polkadot have made strides in data linkage and blockchain interoperability, Web3Bay captures attention by tackling the inefficiencies of e-commerce, delivering financial fairness and autonomy to its users. Web3Bay Pioneers Decentralized E-commerce with Blockchain! The migration from traditional to blockchain-enabled marketplaces is accelerating, with Web3Bay leading by eradicating intermediaries and empowering buyers and sellers with full transaction control. Web3Bay diverges from centralized services that set rigid rules and high fees, offering a decentralized choice where transactions are protected by smart contracts and ownership transparency is a given. The foundational principles of Web3—ownership, transparency, and decentralization—are reshaping online commerce. Web3Bay leverages blockchain to allow sellers to keep a larger share of profits while buyers enjoy transparent pricing free of undisclosed fees. Escrow-backed smart contracts also minimize fraud and disputes, fostering a marketplace where trust prevails over corporate governance. Investor trust in Web3Bay is on the rise, as evidenced by its presale collecting $1.5 million so far. Now in Stage 4, the 3BAY token is valued at $0.00456, with a total of over 375 million tokens already purchased. As users increasingly seek autonomy in their dealings, Web3Bay is recognized as a beacon for financial fairness and autonomy in online shopping. Chainlink’s Journey: From Inception to Today Launched in 2017, Chainlink (LINK) set out to connect smart contracts with real-world data via a decentralized Oracle network. It debuted during its ICO at a price of $0.11 and gathered $32 million. The technology has since facilitated secure access to external data for smart contracts, crucial for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. As of February 19, 2025, LINK is trading at $18.04, marking an increase of more than 16,000% from its ICO, with a circulating supply of about 517 million tokens and a market cap of $9.33 billion. Its significant role in DeFi, securing assets valued at over $75 billion across various platforms, contributes to this success. Polkadot’s Development and Current Market Performance Polkadot (DOT), which started in May 2020, seeks to improve blockchain interoperability with its innovative multi-chain structure.

40937161,https://coingape.com/?p=241500,1740708923,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,US SEC Confirms Meme Coins Are Not Securities but Warns of Fraud,https://coingape.com/us-sec-confirms-meme-coins-are-not-securities-but-warns-of-fraud/,"The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has clarified that meme coins do not fall under federal securities laws. The agency stated that these digital assets are more like collectibles and are not subject to the regulations that apply to traditional financial instruments. However, the SEC warned that fraudulent activities related to meme coins could still lead to enforcement actions by other federal or state authorities. US SEC States Meme Coins Are Not Securities In a statement released on February 27, the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance stated that meme coins do not qualify as securities under the Securities Act of 1933. “It is the Division’s view that transactions in the types of meme coins described in this statement do not involve the offer and sale of securities under the federal securities laws,” the statement read. The agency explained that meme coins do not provide any rights to future income, profits, or assets, which are key factors in determining whether an asset is a security. It also noted that meme coins do not generate yield and are primarily driven by market speculation and social trends. The agency clarified that since meme coins do not meet the definition of securities, their issuers and traders do not need to register transactions with the agency. The statement emphasized that meme coin buyers and holders are not protected by securities laws. SEC Warns of Fraud in the Meme Coin Market Despite the clarification that they are not securities, the SEC warned that fraudulent activities in this sector could still face legal consequences. The agency noted that while it does not regulate meme coins under securities laws, other federal or state agencies may take action against deceptive practices. Khurram Dara, a lawyer at Bain Capital Crypto, pointed out that misleading promotions, scams, and fraudulent schemes involving meme coins could still be prosecuted. The agency also stated that it would continue to monitor the crypto market for any potential violations of financial regulations. “The offer and sale of meme coins do not involve an investment in an enterprise nor is it undertaken with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others,” the statement added. House Democrats Bill to Restrict Politicians Before the SEC’s statement, House Democrats had announced plans to introduce the Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement (MEME) Act. The proposed bill seeks to prevent public officials, including presidents and their families, from launching or endorsing meme coins. California Representative Sam Liccardo, who is leading the bill, stated that the legislation aims to stop political figures from profiting off meme coins. The move comes after President Donald Trump launched a meme coin named “TRUMP” shortly before taking office. The TRUMP token saw rapid gains but later experienced a sharp decline, losing over 50% of its value in the past month. The market reaction led to concerns about political figures using meme coins for financial gain. Crypto Industry Reacts to SEC’s Clarification The statement has been welcomed by some members of the crypto industry who have long sought regulatory clarity. Ishmael Green, a crypto attorney at Diaz Reus law firm, said the decision could encourage more investment in the U.S. crypto market. “This will drive continued investment in the U.S. crypto space, as the vast majority of meme coins launched in the last 12 months with multibillion-dollar market caps have been released on Solana, an American blockchain,” Green stated. Major crypto exchanges, including Coinbase and Robinhood , saw a slight rise in their stock prices following the agency’s announcement. Market analysts believe that the clarification could allow exchanges to list more meme coins without the risk of regulatory enforcement.

The exchange has been rocked this month by sanctions from the regulatory Financial Intelligence Unit and news of a tax probe from the National Tax Service . Upbit Stock: Prices ‘Plummet’ The FIU punished Upbit’s operator Dunamu with a three-month restriction order on the activities of new users after ruling that the platform mishandled thousands of KYC verifications. A ‘bogus social security card’ allegedly accepted by Upbit as part of its KYC checks on new customers. (Source: KBS News/Screenshot) The same body also ordered the dismissal of the company’s compliance and reporting leads. It will follow up at a later date with fines. The tax body, meanwhile, thinks that customers may have used the exchange to evade taxes by using Upbit to send their funds to overseas platforms. The platform is also in the political spotlight, with many lawmakers criticizing Seoul for allowing Upbit to become a “monopoly,” with over 70% of the domestic crypto market share. Further issues continue to dog the exchange, with regulators suggesting the exchange has failed to follow crypto “market rules.” Per the South Korean media outlet Nogaek , Upbit now finds itself under “sudden all-out pressure from the regulatory authorities.” And this pressure, the media outlet wrote, has “put the brakes on its rapid growth.” Quoting data from South Korean unlisted stock price data providers, Dunama shares “have been falling for the past three months.” The Upbit customer service center in Seoul, South Korea. (Source: KBS News/Screenshot) 30% Drop The providers say that Upbit prices have tumbled from 217,000 won on December 17, 2024, to 153,000 won in late February, a fall of almost 30%. The media outlet added that the latest investigations will see Upbit’s “overseas remittance and transaction history” placed under scrutiny. Investigators also want to probe Upbit’s operations in Singapore, Thailand, and Indonesia via its Southeast Asia subsidiaries. The outlet suggested that if Upbit is found guilty of tax offenses, punishments “may go beyond simple fines” and instead result in “criminal cases.” However, the media outlet also said that some experts had opined that Upbit’s current “crisis” could transform into “an opportunity for another leap forward.” Market experts said that if Upbit could “overcome” the hurdles it now faces, it is likely to return to “a strong growth path” and a stock price “rebound.” They added that they expected the crypto market to experience a “long-term growth curve.” Like many major crypto exchanges, Upbit’s financial performance is closely linked to Bitcoin (BTC) prices. Trading volumes on the Upbit crypto exchange over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko) Corporate Investment Hope? During previous BTC bull markets, Upbit’s performance improved as traders became more active on its platform. High trading volumes result in more commission fee-derived revenue for Upbit and many of its main competitors. The South Korean crypto market will also receive further stimulus this year, as regulators finally allow corporations to buy BTC using their balance sheets .

You can take advantage of the situation and make money, whether the price is falling or increasing. You can test the AI robo advisor using its recently released beta platform. Even though RCO Finance is in the presale stage, it has shipped the beta platform for users to test and grow their portfolios. Over 10,000 users are already using the platform and providing feedback. The RCO Finance team has promised more features and upgrades in their upcoming alpha version.

The robo advisor evaluates the market’s volatility and adjusts their holdings in real-time. In addition, you can create your diverse portfolio by choosing assets from over 120,000 options.

As the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap struggles to maintain its footing, the Ethereum price has dropped sharply, triggering a wave of uncertainty among traders. With the Ethereum price teetering near the $2,400 mark and facing its worst February since 2018, a $100 million sell-off has further exacerbated the situation. This dramatic downturn has left traders searching for alternative investments, and one rising star in the crypto world, RCO Finance (RCOF) , is quickly capturing attention. Ethereum Price Crash: A High-Stakes Battle Between Bulls and Bears The recent Ethereum price crash has put the market on edge, with traders closely monitoring a potential short squeeze that could either fuel a rebound or deepen the decline. Currently trading at $2,479, Ethereum faces a massive liquidation risk, with over $2 billion in short positions set to be wiped out if ETH climbs to $3,000. This could trigger a short squeeze, forcing bearish traders to cover their positions and accelerating the Ethereum price recovery. However, uncertainty looms. A failure to reach the $3,000 threshold could prolong bearish sentiment, potentially driving ETH below $2,150. Compounding this pressure, an early Ethereum ICO whale has been offloading holdings, selling over $24.5 million worth of ETH in recent days. This large-scale profit-taking has spooked investors, raising concerns of further downward momentum. Ethereum now stands at a crucial juncture, with upcoming price movements likely determining whether it follows Bitcoin’s 2021 rally or continues its slump. RCO Finance (RCOF): The Rising DeFi Star Amid Ethereum’s Market Shake-Up As the Ethereum price grapples with a turbulent market, RCO Finance (RCOF) is rapidly gaining traction as the next big disruptor in decentralized finance. While Ethereum faces the risk of liquidation-driven volatility, RCO Finance draws investor attention with its cutting-edge AI-driven technology and innovative financial solutions. Unlike traditional altcoins focused on blockchain efficiency, RCO Finance integrates artificial intelligence to revolutionize portfolio management and asset diversification, setting a new standard in the DeFi sector. At the core of RCO Finance’s ecosystem is its AI Robo Advisor, an autonomous tool designed to navigate the complexities of the crypto market. This intelligent system continuously analyzes real-time market trends, historical data, and breaking financial news, ensuring investors maximize opportunities while minimizing risk. Unlike human traders prone to emotional decisions, the Robo Advisor operates 24/7, swiftly identifying high-potential assets, such as the recent surge in Vana (VANA) , which skyrocketed by 80% in just 24 hours. Moreover, it employs advanced hedging techniques to protect portfolios from sudden market downturns, leveraging insights from financial institutions and sources like Reuters to make data-driven recommendations. RCO Finance also redefines digital asset utility by enabling seamless investments in crypto and traditional financial markets. Users can diversify their holdings across stocks, bonds, and real estate without fiat conversions through its innovative framework. This breakthrough eliminates the usual barriers between blockchain-based and traditional finance, allowing investors to easily build multi-asset portfolios. Additionally, RCO Finance ensures full financial autonomy with low transaction fees and a completely KYC-free onboarding process, providing a seamless and private investment experience. Security remains a top priority, and SolidProof audits and verifies all smart contracts, offering users confidence in the platform’s reliability. Investor interest in RCO Finance is surging, particularly following the beta launch of its platform, which has already attracted over 10,000 active users. This growing adoption is fueled by the platform’s seamless automation, allowing even novice investors to execute complex trading strategies effortlessly. With the upcoming alpha launch, additional features, such as real-time portfolio monitoring and enhanced AI analytics, are set to further elevate RCO Finance’s appeal. RCO Finance (RCOF) Presale: A Prime Opportunity for Early Investors With Ethereum’s volatility prompting traders to seek alternative investment opportunities, RCO Finance is emerging as a high-potential asset. Currently in Presale Stage 5, RCOF tokens are available at $0.10, with the price set to increase to $0.13 in the next stage. Market analysts predict a listing price of $0.60, positioning early investors for potential 600% returns.

Beyond price appreciation, RCO Finance presents multiple avenues for wealth-building, including staking and yield farming, with APYs as high as 86%. Investors also gain exclusive benefits such as AI-powered trading analytics, fee discounts, priority customer support, and governance rights, allowing them to shape the platform’s future. As the Ethereum price fluctuations introduce uncertainty, RCO Finance is a promising alternative for traders seeking stability and exponential growth. With its AI-powered financial tools, multi-asset investment capabilities, and rapidly expanding community, RCO Finance is not just another altcoin; it is a transformative force in DeFi. Now is the time to seize this opportunity and become part of the next evolution in decentralized finance.

Internet Computer (ICP) works to replace traditional cloud systems with a decentralized network, while The Graph (GRT) simplifies data access through efficient blockchain indexing for decentralized apps. Yet, both face challenges related to market volatility and adoption hurdles. Web3Bay sets itself apart by blending AI smart contracts with blockchain technology, boosting e-commerce security, preventing fraud, and streamlining transactions. Using AI-powered contracts, Web3Bay connects blockchain capabilities with practical uses in online shopping. Web3Bay Uses AI to Secure and Personalize E-Commerce Web3Bay’s AI-driven smart contracts enhance security, tailor shopping experiences, and combat fraud in decentralized online markets. Common issues like fake products, chargeback scams, and slow dispute resolution are tackled by automating processes that keep transactions transparent and safe while offering personalized recommendations based on user activity. By analyzing transaction patterns, Web3Bay’s AI detects and blocks fraud attempts before they happen, protecting sellers and building buyer confidence. Escrow payments are automated using smart contracts that release funds only when terms are met, preventing false claims and disputes. Beyond safety, Web3Bay improves product discovery with AI that delivers personalized deals, unlike traditional platforms that use generic algorithms. This approach boosts user satisfaction while helping sellers increase their sales. With $1.5 million raised during its presale and over 380 million tokens sold in Stage 4 at $0.00456 per 3BAY, Web3Bay’s AI-driven model is set to reshape online shopping. Internet Computer (ICP): Decentralized Cloud and Network Growth Launched on May 10, 2021, by the DFINITY Foundation, Internet Computer (ICP) extends the Internet’s capabilities as a global computing platform. Unlike standard cloud services, it relies on independent data centers worldwide, allowing smart contracts to deliver interactive web content directly to users and removing the need for servers and centralized infrastructure. ICP has grown significantly, with the network processing over three billion blocks by March 2024, surpassing the block count of many other blockchains. This reflects its scalability and growing use in decentralized services. Financially, ICP has seen volatility. After launching at $461.65, its price as of February 19, 2025, stands at $6.88—a drop of about 98.5%. Despite this, ICP’s market capitalization remains strong at around $3.26 billion, showing that the platform continues to attract interest despite price swings. The Graph (GRT): Indexing Blockchain Data for Decentralized Apps Introduced in December 2020, The Graph (GRT) is an open-source protocol that indexes blockchain data, enabling developers to access and retrieve information from various networks. Using subgraphs—open APIs—it organizes and extracts data, supporting decentralized applications. The Graph’s query demand has grown substantially. In Q1 2024, the network processed over 1.6 billion queries, up 66% from the previous quarter. By Q2 2024, this number reached 2.9 billion queries—an 81.25% increase—highlighting its expanding role in the decentralized data ecosystem. From a financial standpoint, GRT has experienced price fluctuations. Initially priced at $0.03, it climbed to an all-time high of $2.84 before declining. As of February 19, 2025, GRT is valued at approximately $0.133935, reflecting a drop from its peak. Still, its market capitalization remains solid at about $1.22 billion, signaling ongoing confidence in its long-term potential. Final Remarks! Blockchain’s growth continues with projects like Internet Computer (ICP) and The Graph (GRT) transforming industries through decentralized computing and data indexing. ICP’s cloud alternatives and GRT’s data retrieval solutions help drive blockchain adoption, though scalability and market volatility remain challenges. Web3Bay stands out by applying blockchain to daily transactions with AI smart contracts that secure payments, prevent fraud, and personalize e-commerce. With a focus on practical benefits, Web3Bay bridges the gap between blockchain and everyday online shopping , signaling its role in driving mainstream blockchain adoption.

Dogecoin (DOGE) holders have gained substantially from November 2024 to January 2025, with the Dogecoin price rallying over 450% in this period.

Analysts suggest PropiChain can undergo a massive 35,000% rally after its listing and provide better returns than Dogecoin in the 2025 crypto bull run. Will Dogecoin Reverse Or Fall To Further Support? The Dogecoin price has performed underwhelmingly due to a decline in demand after its November rally. It has undergone a significant correction over the past few weeks after a rejection from the $0.42 resistance. Due to this rejection, Dogecoin plunged over 40% and consolidated at the $0.23 support for over two weeks. On Monday, DOGE witnessed massive selling pressure and dropped below this support level. In the last 24 hours, the daily trading volume has increased by 144%, and Dogecoin has declined 12.68%, currently trading at $0.2013. Due to the massive plunge, DOGE is now oversold with an RSI of 25.71. Dogecoin moved below its long-term 250-day SMA and is taking support at $0.196. If bulls enter and maintain the price above this support, it may reverse. PropiChain (PCHAIN): Invest In Tokenized Real Estate PropiChain is revolutionizing the real estate industry with its advanced RWA platform. It uses blockchain, AI, and the Metaverse to address the issues that have long plagued real estate investors, such as opaque pricing, high transaction costs, fraud risks, and lack of transparency. PropiChain uses tokens to represent small fractions of properties so users can trade real estate on the blockchain. This fractional ownership model enhances liquidity and diversification opportunities, giving users an advantage over conventional investors. The platform has also integrated advanced AI tools to simplify various investment processes. It has 24/7 active AI chatbots and virtual assistants that resolve users’ investment-related queries and provide assistance with complex paperwork and legal documents. The AI provides market insights by analyzing historical real estate sales data, such as future price fluctuations and demand changes. These insights help users develop data-driven investment strategies that can capture maximum returns. Users can also automate these strategies using AI by setting a condition like a specific valuation for a buy or sell order on a particular piece of real estate. The AI tracks the valuation and executes the order precisely to maximize potential returns. Furthermore, PropiChain users can use the Metaverse to get immersive 3D renderings for all listed real estate. Investors can thus take virtual tours of distant properties and assess their dream real estate to finalize investments from the comfort of their homes. Moreover, real estate owners can use the platform’s smart contracts to create lease agreements without manual paperwork or assistance from lawyers. The smart contracts automatically trigger the deal after the tenant transfers funds and both parties sign the document. Tenants can also automate their monthly rental payments using PropiChain’s smart contracts, and the landlord can set fixed penalties for late deposits. All the documents are stored on the blockchain, making the lease agreement publicly accessible and tamper-proof. PCHAIN: How The Emerging Crypto Can Outshine Dogecoin PCHAIN , the native token of the PropiChain ecosystem, is in the crypto presale phase. In stage two of the presale, it is available at an undervalued price of $0.011. The token’s value will soon surge to $0.023 when it reaches the third stage and to $0.032 after the presale. Thus, early investors who acquire the token before its next surge can turn $1,000 into over $2,000 by the next stage and over $2,900 by the end of the crypto presale. Moreover, crypto analysts suggest that PCHAIN’s practical use cases position it to undergo better growth than Dogecoin. They have predicted a massive 35,000% surge by the end of 2025, providing a $351,000 return on a $1,000 investment to early participants. Conclusion Due to disheartening performance, many Dogecoin holders are moving funds to the PropiChain token presale to make steady returns. Analysts also prefer PropiChain, as it has shown better returns in the past few weeks and has the potential for explosive growth after its launch. Regarding user safety, the leading blockchain security firm, BlockAudit , conducted rigorous security testing of the PropiChain platform, inspecting core infrastructure, smart contracts, security measures, and regulatory compliance. The final audit report highlights zero security vulnerabilities, reliable infrastructure, and complete compliance with regulations, guaranteeing PropiChain’s integrity and the security of the user’s funds. Furthermore, PCHAIN has been listed on CoinMarketCap . The listing has provided a broad audience for the project, significantly boosting its crypto presale performance. Token holders can expect quicker returns as the project reaches further milestones and presale gains more momentum. Analysts suggest PCHAIN can provide tremendous returns and outperform the Dogecoin price in the next bull cycle, forecasting a massive 35,000% rally this year. Thus, early presale participants can turn $1,000 in PCHAIN at this stage into $351,000 by the end of the year.

OpenAI just dropped a bombshell in the AI world with its latest model, GPT-4.5, codenamed ‘Orion.’ This isn’t just another incremental update; it’s a leap in AI persuasion , showcasing an uncanny ability to influence even other AI models. Imagine an AI that’s not just intelligent, but also remarkably convincing – that’s GPT-4.5. Let’s dive into why this news is sending ripples across the tech and crypto communities. Why is GPT-4.5’s Persuasion Prowess a Game Changer? OpenAI’s recent white paper reveals fascinating insights into GPT-4.5 ‘s capabilities, particularly in ‘persuasion.’ But what does this mean in practical terms? Essentially, OpenAI rigorously tested how well GPT-4.5 could influence beliefs and actions using model-generated content. The results are eye-opening, especially for those watching the intersection of AI and digital economies. One standout benchmark involved GPT-4.5 attempting to persuade another AI model , GPT-4o, to ‘donate’ virtual money. The outcome? GPT-4.5 outperformed all other OpenAI models, including those specifically designed for reasoning. It even surpassed the o3-mini model by a significant 10 percentage points in deceiving GPT-4o into revealing a secret codeword. This isn’t just about clever algorithms; it’s about a new level of sophistication in AI interaction. Here’s a breakdown of GPT-4.5’s performance in OpenAI’s persuasion benchmarks: Benchmark GPT-4.5 Performance Key Observation Virtual Money Donation Superior to all other OpenAI models GPT-4.5 employed a ‘modest request’ strategy, asking for smaller amounts to increase success rate. Codeword Deception 10 percentage points better than o3-mini Demonstrates enhanced ability to manipulate and extract information from other AI models. This data, straight from OpenAI’s evaluations, underscores a critical point: AI models are evolving beyond mere data processing; they’re learning the art of influence. While the amounts ‘donated’ were virtual, the implications for real-world applications, especially in areas like decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and smart contracts, are substantial. Navigating the Ethical Tightrope: AI Safety and Persuasion The rise of highly persuasive AI models like GPT-4.5 isn’t without its concerns, particularly around AI safety .

The company has stated that GPT-4.5, despite its persuasive abilities, doesn’t yet cross their internal ‘high-risk’ threshold for this benchmark. However, they’ve also committed to rigorous safety interventions before releasing any model that does reach that level. This is a crucial stance, considering the growing anxieties around AI-driven deepfakes and social engineering attacks. The ability of an AI to convincingly persuade could be a double-edged sword. While it opens doors for innovative applications, it also raises questions about misuse. OpenAI’s proactive approach to AI safety , including revising methods to assess real-world persuasion risks, is a welcome step in responsible AI development. What Does This Mean for the Future of AI and Crypto? For the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, GPT-4.5’s persuasion capabilities could unlock exciting new possibilities: Enhanced Smart Contracts: Imagine smart contracts that can dynamically adapt and negotiate terms based on persuasive AI agents. DAOs with Nuance: DAOs could become more sophisticated in decision-making, leveraging AI for nuanced negotiations and consensus-building. Advanced Trading Bots: AI-powered trading bots could evolve to not just analyze data, but also persuasively interact with market participants (other AI agents or even human traders in a controlled context – ethically of course!). However, it’s vital to approach these advancements with caution. As AI persuasion becomes more refined, the need for robust ethical frameworks and regulatory discussions in the crypto and AI sectors becomes paramount. We need to ensure that this powerful technology is used responsibly and for the benefit of the ecosystem.

OpenAI, the powerhouse behind ChatGPT, has just dropped a bombshell: they’re facing a critical GPU shortage . CEO Sam Altman himself confirmed that the rollout of their highly anticipated GPT-4.5 model is being throttled because, quite simply, they’ve run out of GPUs. For crypto enthusiasts and tech followers who understand the value of computational power, this news is a stark reminder of the infrastructure challenges underpinning the AI revolution. OpenAI Confirms GPU Shortage Hindering GPT-4.5 Launch In a candid post on X, Altman stated the obvious – OpenAI’s rapid growth and the sheer scale of GPT-4.5 have led to an unprecedented demand for Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). These powerful processors are the lifeblood of modern AI, enabling the complex computations needed to run large language models. According to Altman, GPT-4.5, described as “giant” and “expensive,” needs “tens of thousands” more GPUs before it can be widely accessible to ChatGPT users. This GPU shortage isn’t just a minor inconvenience; it’s a significant bottleneck impacting the accessibility of cutting-edge AI. GPT-4.5: First Access for ChatGPT Pro, Then Plus – But When for Everyone Else? The rollout plan is now staggered. ChatGPT Pro subscribers will get first dibs on GPT-4.5 starting this Thursday, followed by ChatGPT Plus customers next week. This phased approach highlights the severity of the GPU shortage . It’s not just about delaying features; it’s about managing limited resources to ensure some level of access while they scramble to acquire more processing power. For users eager to experience the latest AI advancements, this wait might feel like an eternity in the fast-paced tech world. Unhinged Pricing: The Staggering Cost of GPT-4.5 Beyond the GPU shortage , another aspect of GPT-4.5 is raising eyebrows – its pricing. Prepare for sticker shock: OpenAI is charging a whopping $75 per million tokens (roughly 750,000 words) fed into the model and $150 per million tokens generated by it. Let’s break down this AI model pricing : Input Cost: $75 per million tokens Output Cost: $150 per million tokens Comparison to GPT-4o: 30x the input cost and 15x the output cost This pricing structure is significantly higher than OpenAI’s current workhorse model, GPT-4o. The 30x increase in input cost and 15x increase in output cost compared to GPT-4o is, as some users online have described, “unhinged.” This pricing model suggests GPT-4.5 is not just an incremental upgrade; it’s a fundamentally more resource-intensive and premium offering. The tweet from Casper Hansen perfectly captures the sentiment: “GPT 4.5 pricing is unhinged. If this doesn’t have enormous models smell, I will be disappointed.” Addressing the Root Cause: OpenAI’s Plan to Tackle GPU Dependency Altman acknowledged that these GPU shortages are not ideal. “We’ve been growing a lot and are out of GPUs,” he admitted. He also mentioned plans to add “tens of thousands of GPUs next week” to expand access to the Plus tier. However, he emphasized the difficulty in predicting and perfectly managing growth surges that lead to these shortages. This isn’t a new problem for OpenAI. Altman has previously stated that limited computing capacity is a recurring obstacle in their product development pipeline. To combat this long-term, OpenAI is taking a multi-pronged approach to lessen their reliance on external GPU suppliers and secure their computing future. Their strategy includes: Developing Proprietary AI Chips: Moving towards in-house chip design to optimize performance and potentially reduce costs and dependency on market fluctuations. This AI chip development is a significant undertaking, but could provide a competitive edge and greater control over their infrastructure. Building Massive Datacenters: Investing in extensive datacenter infrastructure to house and operate the massive computational resources needed for their AI models. This is a capital-intensive but necessary step to support the growing demand for AI. What Does This Mean for the Future of AI and Crypto? The OpenAI GPU shortage is more than just a temporary setback; it’s a symptom of the intense computational demands of advanced AI and the limitations of current infrastructure. For the cryptocurrency world, which is increasingly intertwined with AI through applications like algorithmic trading, blockchain analytics, and decentralized AI platforms, this news is highly relevant. Here’s why this GPU crunch matters to the crypto and broader tech space: AI Development Bottleneck: GPU scarcity can slow down the pace of AI innovation across industries. If even giants like OpenAI are struggling, smaller startups and research labs could face even greater hurdles. Increased Costs: High demand for GPUs can drive up prices, making AI development more expensive. This could impact the accessibility and affordability of AI-powered tools and services.

Crypto markets are known for their volatility, and just when you thought you’d seen it all, another twist emerges. Recent analysis from CryptoQuant analyst tugbachain suggests we might be witnessing a crucial turning point for Bitcoin. Let’s dive into the details and understand what this could mean for your crypto portfolio. Is Bitcoin Oversold? Decoding the NVT Golden Cross Signal According to a recent report by CryptoQuant analyst tugbachain, the NVT Golden Cross indicator has flashed a significant signal. This indicator, which is closely watched by market experts, has plunged below -2.4. Why is this important? This level typically indicates that Bitcoin has entered an oversold territory. But what exactly does “oversold” mean in the context of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets? Oversold Explained: When an asset is oversold, it suggests that the price has fallen too quickly and too far, often driven by excessive selling pressure. This situation is often considered unsustainable in the long run. The NVT Golden Cross Indicator: The NVT (Network Value to Transactions) Golden Cross is a momentum indicator that compares the network value of Bitcoin to the daily transaction volume on the blockchain. A low NVT Golden Cross can suggest undervaluation or oversold conditions. Below -2.4 Threshold: Historically, when the NVT Golden Cross dips below -2.4, it has often preceded periods of price stabilization or even upward price correction for Bitcoin. In simpler terms, the NVT Golden Cross indicator is suggesting that the recent Bitcoin price drop might be an overreaction, and the market could be poised for a reversal. Potential Bitcoin Rebound: What Could Trigger the Turnaround? While the Bitcoin oversold signal is promising, it’s crucial to understand that it’s not a guarantee of an immediate price surge. However, it does increase the probability of a Bitcoin rebound . So, what factors could contribute to a potential upward movement? Market Sentiment Shift: Oversold conditions can sometimes lead to a shift in market sentiment. Traders and investors might start to view Bitcoin as undervalued, leading to renewed buying interest. Technical Correction: After a sharp decline, markets often experience a technical correction. This is a natural price recovery as the market adjusts from the excessive selling pressure. Whale Activity: Large Bitcoin holders, often referred to as “whales,” might see oversold conditions as an opportune moment to accumulate more Bitcoin, further driving up demand and potentially triggering a rebound. Positive News Catalysts: Unexpected positive news, such as favorable regulatory developments or increased institutional adoption, could act as a catalyst to propel Bitcoin out of the oversold zone. It’s important to remember that the crypto market is influenced by a multitude of factors, and predicting the exact timing and magnitude of a rebound is challenging. However, the oversold signal combined with these potential catalysts does paint a cautiously optimistic picture. Analyzing Bitcoin Price Analysis: Key Resistance Levels to Watch If a Bitcoin rebound does materialize, where could the price potentially go? The CryptoQuant analyst points to a significant resistance level: the 111-day moving average (DMA), currently around $96,895. Let’s break down why this level is important in Bitcoin price analysis : Technical Indicator Description Significance 111-day Moving Average (DMA) The average closing price of Bitcoin over the past 111 days. Moving averages are used to smooth out price fluctuations and identify trends. The 111-DMA can act as a dynamic resistance level. Resistance Level A price level where selling pressure is expected to outweigh buying pressure, potentially halting or reversing an upward price movement. If Bitcoin rebounds, the 111-DMA at $96,895 could present a significant hurdle. Breaking above this level would signal further bullish momentum. Traders and investors should closely monitor Bitcoin’s price action around this $96,895 level if a rebound begins. A successful break above this resistance could open the door for further gains, while failure to overcome it might indicate continued consolidation or even another price correction.

Watch for Confirmation: Don’t rely solely on one indicator. Look for confirmation of a rebound through other technical indicators, price action, and market sentiment shifts. The current market situation presents both risks and opportunities. By staying informed, understanding the signals like the NVT Golden Cross, and managing your risk, you can navigate this potentially pivotal moment in the Bitcoin market. Conclusion: Is the Bitcoin Bottom In? A Cautious Optimism The analysis from CryptoQuant analyst tugbachain, highlighting the Bitcoin oversold signal based on the NVT Golden Cross, offers a glimmer of hope for those watching the recent price declines. While it’s not a guarantee of an immediate price surge, it does suggest that a Bitcoin rebound is increasingly probable. The 111-DMA at $96,895 stands as a key resistance level to watch if the rebound materializes, and Bitcoin price analysis suggests this level will be crucial. By understanding these signals and remaining vigilant, you can position yourself to potentially capitalize on the next phase of Bitcoin’s market cycle.

The usually smooth waters of testnet deployments have just encountered a significant ripple. Ethereum core developer Tim Beiko has sounded the alarm on X, announcing an urgent situation with the Pectra upgrade on the Holesky testnet. What started as a routine activation on Monday has quickly turned into a race against time to stabilize the network. Let’s dive into what’s happening and what it means for you, especially if you’re a validator on Holesky or Sepolia. What’s the Buzz About the Ethereum Pectra Upgrade and Holesky Testnet? For those unfamiliar, the Ethereum Pectra upgrade is the next major step in Ethereum’s ongoing evolution. Think of it as the latest software update for the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. These upgrades are crucial for enhancing Ethereum’s capabilities, improving performance, and paving the way for future innovations. Before these upgrades hit the main Ethereum network, they are rigorously tested on testnets like Holesky. Holesky testnet , launched as a successor to Goerli, is designed to simulate the Ethereum mainnet environment, allowing developers to test new features and upgrades in a live setting without risking real funds. It’s a critical sandbox for ensuring the robustness and stability of Ethereum’s future developments. Think of it as a dress rehearsal before the main show. The Chain Split Bug: A Speed Bump in the Pectra Upgrade Journey The current hiccup involves a “chain-splitting EL bug” that emerged immediately after the Pectra upgrade activated on Holesky this Monday. In simple terms, a chain split means the blockchain is no longer in agreement about its history. Imagine two groups of people reading different versions of the same book – that’s essentially what a chain split is in the blockchain world. This disagreement can lead to network instability and unpredictable behavior, which is the last thing you want on a testnet designed for stability testing! Why is a chain split bug a problem? Network Instability: A chain split disrupts the smooth operation of the testnet, making it unreliable for developers to test their applications. Data Inconsistency: Different parts of the network might have different views of the blockchain’s state, leading to confusion and errors. Hindered Testing: The primary purpose of Holesky, to test upgrades, is compromised if the testnet itself is unstable. This isn’t necessarily a doomsday scenario, but it’s definitely a red flag that requires immediate attention from the Ethereum core developers. It highlights the inherent complexities in upgrading a decentralized network and the importance of thorough testing. Urgent Call to Action: Holesky Validators Must Update Now! Tim Beiko’s announcement wasn’t just an FYI; it was an urgent call to action, particularly for validators on the Holesky testnet. Validators are the backbone of any proof-of-stake blockchain like Ethereum. They are responsible for verifying transactions and maintaining the network’s integrity. If validators don’t act quickly, the consequences could be significant. The Key Action: Node Update The fix for this chain split bug comes in the form of a software update for Ethereum Execution Layer (EL) clients. Validators are being instructed to update their nodes – the software they run to participate in the Ethereum network – to the latest version that incorporates the fix. This update is crucial to bring the network back into consensus and resolve the chain split. Why is this update so critical? Because failure to update nodes by a specific deadline leads to a rather unpleasant outcome: a mass slashing event. Mass Slashing Event: The Clock is Ticking! Now, let’s talk about the elephant in the room – the dreaded “mass slashing event.” Slashing is a mechanism in proof-of-stake systems designed to penalize validators for misbehavior or, in this case, for running outdated software that contributes to network instability. In essence, validators who don’t update their nodes in time will face a penalty, losing a portion of their staked ETH. The Deadline: February 28th, 15:00 UTC Mark your calendars and set your alarms, Holesky validators! The deadline for updating nodes is February 28th at 15:00 UTC. This isn’t just a suggestion; it’s a hard deadline. Validators who haven’t updated by this time risk being slashed. The urgency is palpable, and the Ethereum development community is working hard to ensure everyone is aware and takes the necessary steps. What does mass slashing mean? Financial Penalty: Validators who are slashed will lose a portion of their staked ETH. The exact amount can vary, but it’s a significant financial disincentive. Reputational Damage: Being slashed can also damage a validator’s reputation within the Ethereum community. Network Health: While slashing is a necessary mechanism, a mass slashing event, even on a testnet, can disrupt network operations and validator participation temporarily. Sepolia Users: Are You Affected Too? The announcement also mentions that some Sepolia users are required to upgrade. Sepolia is another important Ethereum testnet, often used for testing smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). While the primary focus of the urgent update is on Holesky due to the Pectra upgrade activation, it seems the underlying bug might have implications for Sepolia as well, at least for certain users. Who on Sepolia needs to upgrade? The specifics for Sepolia users are less detailed in the initial announcement, but the mention suggests that if you are running a node on Sepolia, especially if you are involved in testing related to recent Ethereum updates or using specific client software, it’s prudent to check for updates and follow any instructions from client developers or the Ethereum Foundation. It’s always better to be safe than sorry, especially when dealing with network-level issues. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community This situation, while concerning, provides valuable insights for the broader cryptocurrency community: Importance of Testnets: This incident underscores the critical role of testnets like Holesky and Sepolia in the development process. They are designed to catch bugs and issues before they impact the mainnet, saving potentially millions (or billions) of dollars and preventing major disruptions. Agility and Responsiveness: The Ethereum core developers’ rapid response and communication highlight the agility of the Ethereum development community. Identifying the bug, developing a fix, and communicating it to validators within a short timeframe demonstrates a robust and responsive system. Validator Responsibility: This event emphasizes the responsibility that comes with being a validator in a proof-of-stake network. Validators are not passive participants; they play an active role in maintaining network health and must be vigilant in applying updates and following protocol guidelines. Transparency and Communication: Tim Beiko’s public announcement on X is a testament to the transparency within the Ethereum ecosystem. Open communication about issues, even critical ones, builds trust and allows the community to respond effectively. Navigating the Ethereum Pectra Upgrade Bug: A Summary The Ethereum Pectra upgrade on the Holesky testnet has hit a snag with a chain-splitting EL bug. This requires immediate action from Holesky validators to update their nodes before the February 28th deadline to avoid a mass slashing event. Some Sepolia users might also need to update. While this is a setback, it’s also a testament to the rigorous testing and proactive nature of Ethereum’s development process. Testnets are doing their job by catching these issues before they reach the mainnet, and the community is mobilizing to address the situation swiftly. This episode serves as a powerful reminder of the complexities of blockchain technology and the constant vigilance required to maintain and upgrade these intricate systems. Stay tuned for further updates as the Ethereum developers work to resolve this issue and get the Pectra upgrade back on track for a smooth and successful deployment.

40939371,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=135164,1740712793,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Triumph for Coinbase: SEC Lawsuit Dismissed with Prejudice – A Relief for Crypto?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/coinbase-sec-lawsuit-dismissed/,"In a surprising turn of events that sent ripples of excitement through the crypto community, leading cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have officially put an end to their legal battle. According to a recent announcement from Tree News on X, the lawsuit between Coinbase and the SEC has been dismissed “with prejudice.” But what does this mean for Coinbase, the broader crypto landscape, and what led to this unexpected resolution? Let’s dive into the details of this landmark lawsuit dismissal and explore its potential implications. What Does ‘Dismissed with Prejudice’ Mean for the Coinbase Lawsuit? For those unfamiliar with legal jargon, “dismissed with prejudice” is a significant term. It essentially means that the case is permanently closed and cannot be refiled in the same court. This is a crucial victory for Coinbase as it signals a definitive end to this particular legal challenge from the SEC. Unlike a dismissal “without prejudice,” which leaves the door open for the case to be brought again, this dismissal provides Coinbase with a sense of closure and legal certainty regarding this specific matter. Let’s break down why this is such a big deal: Finality: The most important aspect is the finality. Coinbase doesn’t have to worry about the SEC resurrecting this exact lawsuit in the future. This removes a significant cloud of uncertainty that has been hanging over the exchange. Positive Signal: A dismissal with prejudice can be interpreted as an acknowledgment, at least in this instance, that the SEC’s case might not have been as strong as initially perceived. It’s not an admission of wrongdoing by the SEC, but it certainly suggests a strategic retreat in this particular legal arena. Resource Relief: Legal battles are expensive and time-consuming. Dismissing the Coinbase lawsuit frees up Coinbase’s resources, both financial and personnel, allowing them to focus on growth, innovation, and navigating the evolving regulatory landscape more proactively. This dismissal comes as a welcome relief for Coinbase and its supporters, who have been closely watching the developments of this legal tussle. Understanding the Context: The SEC’s Crypto Regulation Stance To fully appreciate the significance of this SEC lawsuit dismissal, it’s important to understand the broader context of the SEC’s approach to crypto regulation . The SEC has been increasingly assertive in its oversight of the cryptocurrency industry, often taking an enforcement-first approach. They have argued that many cryptocurrencies and crypto-related services fall under their jurisdiction as securities, requiring them to comply with securities laws. Coinbase, as one of the largest and most prominent cryptocurrency exchanges globally, has often found itself in the crosshairs of regulatory scrutiny. The specifics of the dismissed lawsuit, while not detailed in the initial announcement, likely revolved around the SEC’s interpretation of Coinbase’s operations and whether certain aspects of their services constituted securities offerings or violations of securities laws. Here’s a simplified look at the SEC’s general concerns regarding crypto: SEC Concern Why it Matters Unregistered Securities The SEC believes many tokens are securities and must be registered, protecting investors through disclosure and oversight. Investor Protection Ensuring fair markets and preventing fraud and manipulation in the crypto space is a key SEC priority. Market Integrity Maintaining orderly and efficient markets, which the SEC believes is compromised by unregulated crypto activities. Coinbase has consistently maintained that it operates within the bounds of the law and has advocated for clearer regulatory guidelines for the crypto industry. This Coinbase SEC situation highlights the ongoing tension between innovation in the crypto space and the traditional regulatory frameworks. Benefits and Broader Implications of the Lawsuit Dismissal The dismissal of the Coinbase SEC lawsuit isn’t just a win for Coinbase; it has broader implications for the entire cryptocurrency industry. Let’s explore some of the key benefits and potential ripple effects: Boost to Coinbase’s Stock and Reputation: The news of the dismissal is likely to be viewed positively by investors, potentially boosting Coinbase’s stock price and strengthening its reputation as a resilient and legally sound platform. Positive Sentiment for Crypto Market: This development could inject positive sentiment into the broader crypto market. It may be interpreted as a sign that regulatory pressures might be easing, or at least that legal battles against major crypto players are not always straightforward for regulators. Potential for Constructive Dialogue: Perhaps this dismissal could pave the way for a more constructive dialogue between the SEC and the crypto industry. Instead of solely relying on enforcement actions, there might be a greater incentive for both sides to engage in developing clearer and more practical regulatory frameworks. Encouragement for Innovation: Reduced legal uncertainty can encourage further innovation and investment in the crypto space. Businesses might feel more confident in developing new products and services knowing that the immediate threat of this particular type of legal action has subsided. However, it’s crucial to remain grounded and realistic. While this lawsuit dismissal is undoubtedly positive news, it doesn’t signify the end of regulatory scrutiny for Coinbase or the crypto industry as a whole. Challenges Ahead and the Future of Crypto Regulation Despite this victory, Coinbase and the crypto industry still face significant regulatory challenges. The SEC and other regulatory bodies globally are continuing to grapple with how to effectively oversee this rapidly evolving sector. Here are some ongoing challenges and considerations: Ongoing Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for crypto remains fragmented and often unclear. Different jurisdictions have varying approaches, and even within the U.S., there’s still a lack of comprehensive and consistent regulations. Potential for Future SEC Actions: While this specific lawsuit is dismissed, it doesn’t preclude the SEC from initiating other investigations or enforcement actions against Coinbase or other crypto companies in the future, potentially on different grounds. Need for Clearer Regulatory Frameworks: The crypto industry continues to advocate for clearer and more tailored regulatory frameworks that recognize the unique characteristics of blockchain technology and digital assets, rather than simply applying existing securities laws in a blanket manner. Global Regulatory Coordination: Given the global nature of cryptocurrencies, international regulatory coordination is essential to prevent regulatory arbitrage and ensure consistent standards across different countries. Coinbase and other industry leaders will need to continue engaging with regulators, advocating for sensible rules, and demonstrating their commitment to compliance and investor protection. The dismissal of this lawsuit is a battle won, but the broader regulatory war is far from over. Actionable Insights: What Can We Learn From This? This lawsuit dismissal provides several valuable insights for both crypto enthusiasts and those in the traditional financial world: Legal Battles are Not Always Decisive: Regulatory agencies don’t always win legal challenges. This case demonstrates that even powerful regulators like the SEC can face setbacks in court. Advocacy and Engagement Matter: Coinbase’s proactive engagement with regulators and its willingness to defend its position in court likely played a role in this outcome. The crypto industry needs to continue advocating for its interests and engaging in constructive dialogue with policymakers. Regulatory Clarity is Crucial: The ongoing regulatory uncertainty highlights the urgent need for clearer and more tailored rules for the crypto industry. This benefits both businesses and consumers by providing a more predictable and stable environment. Resilience of the Crypto Industry: Despite facing numerous regulatory hurdles and legal challenges, the crypto industry continues to demonstrate resilience and innovation. This dismissal can be seen as another example of its ability to navigate complex and often hostile regulatory environments. Conclusion: A Moment of Relief, But the Journey Continues The dismissal of the lawsuit between Coinbase and the SEC with prejudice marks a significant and undoubtedly positive development for Coinbase and the cryptocurrency industry. It’s a moment of relief, offering a respite from legal uncertainty and potentially paving the way for a more constructive regulatory dialogue. However, it’s crucial to remember that this is just one step in a long and evolving journey. The regulatory landscape for crypto remains complex and dynamic, and ongoing engagement, advocacy, and collaboration will be essential to ensure the responsible and sustainable growth of this transformative technology. This victory should be seen as an encouragement to continue building, innovating, and working towards a future where crypto can thrive within a clear and supportive regulatory framework.

40939791,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=135169,1740713342,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary Crypto Partnership: Aleo Foundation Joins Forces with Google Cloud for Zero-Knowledge Innovation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/aleo-foundation-google-cloud-partnership/,"Exciting news ripples through the crypto sphere! Aleo Foundation, the driving force behind the innovative layer-1 blockchain leveraging zero-knowledge proof technology, has just announced a groundbreaking strategic partnership with tech giant Google Cloud. This collaboration is poised to inject fresh momentum into the world of blockchain analytics and developer accessibility. Let’s dive into what this powerful alliance means for the future of blockchain and, more specifically, the Aleo ecosystem. Why is this Strategic Partnership a Game Changer? In a nutshell, this strategic partnership is a significant leap forward for both Aleo and the wider blockchain community. Google Cloud, a titan in cloud computing, will officially step in as a blockchain validator for the Aleo network. But the collaboration extends far beyond validation. Google Cloud plans to deeply integrate with and analyze Aleo’s blockchain data using its sophisticated BigQuery platform. What does this mean in practical terms? Enhanced Network Security and Reliability: Google Cloud’s participation as a validator strengthens Aleo’s network by adding a robust and reputable entity to the consensus mechanism. Unlocking Real-Time Blockchain Data Analysis: The integration with Google Cloud BigQuery is the real headline here.

In a technical analysis shared on X, Rose Premium Signals (@VipRoseTr) highlights a potentially bullish setup for Dogecoin (DOGE), fueled by a classic “Cup & Handle” pattern. Dogecoin Cup And Handle Could Emerge According to the chart, the DOGE price could face a last leg down before it will find its low near the $0.16896 support zone. This level marks the base of a possible Cup & Handle pattern—a formation characterized by a rounded “cup” followed by a smaller consolidation or “handle.” Technically, the cup phase reflects the market’s effort to find a bottom, while the handle phase often takes shape as a brief pullback or sideways movement before a potential breakout. The pivotal zone for DOGE’s next move appears to be near $0.29124. If price rallies above this threshold, it would likely confirm the Cup & Handle formation and could trigger a robust upward swing. The chart suggests that traders may interpret a decisive daily or weekly close above $0.29124 as a confirmation signal, potentially ushering in bullish momentum. Related Reading: Long-Term Dogecoin Holders Are In “Denial” – On-Chain Metrics Expose Weakness “DOGE is showing strong bullish potential as it approaches a key reversal zone. Price has reached the $0.16896 support, aligning with a potential Cup & Handle formation. A breakout above $0.29124 could confirm a rally toward new highs,” Rose Premium Signals writes via X. In terms of upside objectives, Rose Premium Signals indicates that DOGE could climb toward the $0.50 – $0.60 range if the Cup & Handle pattern plays out as anticipated. This target corresponds to historical zones of increased trading activity and psychological levels that often capture traders’ attention. The analysis further notes potential for further upside, hinting that Dogecoin’s trajectory may extend beyond $0.60 should positive sentiment intensify. “Long-term target sits near $0.50 – $0.60, with potential for further upside. If momentum continues, Dogecoin could reclaim its meme coin throne and push toward higher levels,” the analysts say. Related Reading: If Dogecoin Falls Below This Level, A Freefall To $0.06 Is Possible: Analyst This commentary underscores DOGE’s capacity to reclaim its status among top meme coins. While the recent memecoin mania has flooded the market with thousands of smaller tokens, diverting attention from the original memecoin, Dogecoin, the landscape may be shifting. Following the burst of the memecoin bubble— which peaked with TRUMP, MELANIA, and LIBRA— focus could soon return to DOGE as traders seek more established assets in the space. From a technical perspective, a decisive breakout with sustained momentum could reignite both retail and institutional interest, propelling DOGE toward higher resistance levels and confirming the potential Cup & Handle pattern.

The cryptocurrency hit a high of $2.97 during a massive rally, despite the broader market downturn that saw Bitcoin dip below $85k. As Pi Coin recovers from an initial sell-off, predictions and targets are flying high, with some speculating that the price could hit $3 or even $4 in the future. What’s Driving Pi’s Price? Despite recent losses, analysts and investors are eyeing potential events that could push the price of Pi Coin higher in the near future. Analyst Kim Wong took to social media and revealed details, listing key events that could lead to Pi’s price surge: Major Exchange Listings: A Pi Coin listing on major exchanges could be right around the corner. If confirmed, it may trigger a big price increase. Past exchange listings, like OKX’s listing, have seen Pi jump by over 36% in just an hour. “If a major exchange greenlight listing, history suggests a 50-100% price pop isn’t out of the question,” he wrote. Increasing Popularity: As Pi Coin gains more attention, new supporters and investors may flock to the Pi Network, boosting demand for Pi Coin. Partnerships with Merchants and Payment Platforms: If major online shopping companies and merchants announce partnerships with Pi Network, it could provide further legitimacy and value to Pi Coin, making it more attractive to buyers. Expansion of the Pi Ecosystem: More decentralized applications (Dapps) in Pi’s ecosystem could increase its utility and spark investor interest. Influential Endorsements: Endorsements from well-known crypto media outlets and experts could significantly increase Pi’s visibility and attract more investors.

Helium & Arweave Investors Are Reacting Fast,https://thecoinrise.com/2025s-biggest-presale-boom-web3bay-secures-1-55m-in-weeks-helium-arweave-investors-are-reacting-fast/,"Blockchain technology is changing industries like wireless connectivity, data storage, and online shopping. Helium introduced a decentralized wireless network where users earn HNT for IoT coverage, while Arweave enables permanent blockchain data storage. As more blockchain services gain attention, Web3Bay is emerging as a key player in decentralized e-commerce. With $1.55 million raised during its presale and over 375 million tokens sold, Web3Bay is attracting widespread interest. Compared to Helium and Arweave, which focus on specific needs, Web3Bay’s platform aims to compete with giants like Amazon and eBay by offering lower fees and more user control. Why Crypto Analysts Show Confidence in Web3Bay’s Growth Potential Web3Bay’s presale has gained traction, raising $1.55 million as popular crypto figures on Twitter and YouTube highlight its potential. With over 375 million tokens sold, the project has drawn the attention of early adopters who see its promise in reshaping online retail. Currently, in Stage 4, the 3BAY token is priced at $0.00456 before the next price increase. Influencer marketing has significantly contributed to boosting Web3Bay’s visibility and traction. Prominent crypto analysts and traders have been pivotal in promoting its decentralized marketplace as an effective alternative to traditional platforms like Amazon and eBay, which are known for their high fees and centralized control. Moreover, reviews on YouTube and active discussions on Twitter have spurred organic engagement, enhancing investor confidence in the project’s innovative vision. Social proof is significantly driving Web3Bay’s expansion. Crypto influencers engaging with the presale and sharing their positive experiences have captured the attention of retail investors. Additionally, endorsements from well-known figures could increase its reach beyond crypto circles. Together, these factors, along with growing demand, position Web3Bay as a blockchain commerce platform with strong community support. Helium: The Crypto-Powered Decentralized Wireless Network Helium was founded in 2013 by Amir Haleem, Shawn Fanning, and Sean Carey, aiming to create a decentralized wireless network. In 2019, it launched Helium Hotspots, allowing users to earn HNT for providing IoT coverage. By 2021, the network had expanded to over 500,000 hotspots in 169 countries. In April 2023, Helium moved to the Solana blockchain to improve efficiency. This transition helped launch Helium Mobile in December 2023, a decentralized mobile network now generating about 90% of the project’s revenue. Despite market ups and downs, Helium remains active in Web3. As of February 2025, HNT trades at $3.46, reflecting steady usage and adoption. Its decentralized model continues to attract individuals and businesses seeking wireless infrastructure outside traditional systems. Arweave: Enabling Permanent Blockchain Storage Arweave began in June 2018, offering permanent data storage on the blockchain. In 2019, it raised $5 million from backers like Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures. Its growth accelerated in 2021 as demand for permanent storage increased with the rise of NFTs. By early 2025, daily data uploads averaged more than 400 GB. Despite price fluctuations, Arweave remains a leading choice for long-term blockchain storage. For example, the AR token rose above $40 in August 2024 before stabilizing at $9.05 in February 2025. Arweave’s lasting value lies in its low-cost, permanent storage for digital assets like archives, NFTs, and decentralized social media. As adoption grows, it continues to serve as a core storage layer for Web3 applications that need data preservation. To Sum Up! Blockchain platforms are reshaping traditional industries, providing decentralized alternatives to centralized services. Helium offers a wireless network powered by user participation, while Arweave ensures permanent data storage. Both address specific needs within blockchain technology. However, Web3Bay takes a broader approach, aiming to disrupt e-commerce with lower fees and greater control for users. With $1.55 million raised in presale and growing recognition across crypto communities, Web3Bay stands out as a platform with the potential to challenge leading online marketplaces.

The exchange, once a dominant player in the crypto derivatives market, has enlisted Broadhaven Capital Partners, an investment banking firm, to facilitate a sale, according to a CoinDesk report . The development comes as BitMEX grapples with legal troubles, including a hefty $100 million fine over anti-money laundering violations. Broadhaven Capital Partners specializes in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) advisory and has worked with several financial institutions in securing strategic deals. The search for a buyer underscores the competitive landscape of the crypto derivatives market, where leading platforms are looking to consolidate their positions. BitMEX, founded in 2014, was once a pioneer in Bitcoin futures trading, but it has faced growing competition from rivals like Deribit, Binance, and Bybit. BitMEX’s reported sale efforts come amid a wave of mergers and acquisitions in the crypto industry. Notably, Deribit, the world’s leading Bitcoin and Ethereum options exchange, has been at the center of a bidding war between Coinbase and Kraken as both firms seek to expand their derivatives offerings. Meanwhile, FalconX, a prime brokerage firm, recently acquired Arbelos Markets , a trading firm specializing in crypto derivatives. The deal is part of FalconX’s expansion strategy to strengthen its presence in the derivatives sector, an area of growing interest for institutional investors. BitMEX’s attempt to find a buyer comes just over a month after a US court ordered the exchange to pay a $100 million fine for violating anti-money laundering laws. This follows a 2022 guilty plea from BitMEX and its co-founders, who had already paid $110 million in penalties. The legal troubles stem from a 2020 indictment that led to Arthur Hayes stepping down as CEO. The US Department of Justice had accused BitMEX’s leadership —including co-founders Ben Delo and Samuel Reed—of failing to implement proper compliance measures, allowing illicit transactions to flow through the exchange. As BitMEX explores a sale, the outcome could reshape the competitive landscape of the crypto derivatives industry. Whether a major player acquires the platform or it struggles to find a buyer remains to be seen. With regulatory scrutiny tightening, the fate of BitMEX will likely influence how other crypto exchanges navigate compliance and M&A strategies moving forward.

The price is now consolidating losses and remains at risk of more losses. XRP price started a fresh decline below the $2.250 level. The price is now trading below $2.220 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.20 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might continue to move down unless there is a close above the $2.30 resistance zone. XRP Price Dips Further XRP price failed to continue higher above the $2.350 resistance zone and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . There was a move below the $2.25 and $2.20 support levels. The price even dipped below the $2.120 support to enter a bearish zone. A low was formed at $2.0220 and the price is now struggling to stay above $2.0. The price is showing many bearish signs below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.363 swing high to the $2.022 low. The price is now trading below $2.10 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.120 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.20 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.363 swing high to the $2.022 low. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.20 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The next resistance is $2.30. A clear move above the $2.30 resistance might send the price toward the $2.350 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.420 resistance or even $2.450 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.50. More Losses? If XRP fails to clear the $2.20 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.020 level. The next major support is near the $2.00 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.00 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $1.9650 support. The next major support sits near the $1.880 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level.

The legal dispute, which began in December 2020, revolves around the SEC’s claim that Ripple sold XRP as an unregistered security. With growing regulatory scrutiny and political pressure, the crypto community is watching closely for any signs of resolution in the XRP lawsuit. Will the SEC Dismiss XRP Lawsuit After Closed-Door Meeting? The SEC’s Sunshine Act meeting focused on enforcement actions, administrative proceedings, and litigation settlements. While the agenda remains confidential, speculation is growing that the Ripple case was a topic of discussion. Recent decisions by the SEC to drop investigations into major crypto firms, including Coinbase and Uniswap, have fueled hopes that the XRP lawsuit may be nearing its conclusion. Legal experts have mixed opinions on the SEC’s next move . Former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel downplayed the speculation, stating, “There’s no more reason to think Ripple is on the agenda than at the last 200 meetings.” However, pro-XRP attorney Bill Morgan remains confident in Ripple’s position, pointing out that the SEC’s legal argument has weakened after Judge Analisa Torres ruled in 2023 that XRP itself is not a security. Cynthia Lummis Stance on SEC Dropping Lawsuits Against Major Firms U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis, a vocal advocate for cryptocurrency regulations, recently highlighted the need for legal clarity on digital assets. She stated, “Most digital assets are not legally securities under the Howey Test. The United States is behind other countries in creating laws for digital assets.” Responding to Lummis’ statement, Bill Morgan referenced the Ripple case and Judge Torres’ ruling. He wrote on X, “So you agree Judge Torres was correct in finding XRP itself is not a security in SEC v Ripple.” This exchange highlights the growing recognition among lawmakers and legal experts that the SEC’s classification of XRP may not hold up under legal scrutiny. Moreover, the SEC has recently withdrawn several high-profile lawsuits, signaling a possible shift in its enforcement strategy. The agency voluntarily dismissed its case against Coinbase Global Inc and Consensys reached an agreement to dismiss the securities enforcement case related to MetaMask. Concurrently, the agency has also dropped cases against Uniswap, Gemini, OpenSea, Robinhood Crypto, and Binance’s case being paused for 60 days. Potential Impact on XRP Price The XRP lawsuit has had a strong effect on Ripple’s market standing. On February 28, XRP declined by 7.59%, following broader market trends with Bitcoin price falling below the $80k support. However, analysts believe that if the US SEC drops its appeal, XRP price could experience a major rally to $320 . Historical price trends show that legal victories for Ripple have led to significant gains. When Judge Torres ruled in Ripple’s favor in July 2023, XRP surged by over 70%. A full dismissal of the XRP lawsuit could push the token toward its previous all-time high of $3.55. Market analysts are also discussing the potential approval of an XRP spot ETF, which could attract institutional investment especially with the agency acknowledging some XRP ETF’s last week. If the Ripple case is resolved, XRP may gain further regulatory clarity, making it more appealing to large financial firms. While speculation around the SEC meeting continues, no official decision has been announced regarding the XRP lawsuit. The next key deadline is April 16, 2025, when Ripple must submit its reply brief related to the SEC’s appeal. If the SEC decides to withdraw its appeal before then, the case could effectively be resolved.

Nevertheless, the coin’s dominance managed to stay up by 0.07%, signaling altcoins continue to face more pressure. ETH Price Slips Below $2,200 ETH price tanked over 7% in the past 24 hours, closing in at $2,152. The coin hit an intraday bottom and peak of $2,128.18 and $2,378.09, respectively. Ethereum recorded liquidations worth $166.28 million in the past 24 hours, rationalizing the slumping action. XRP Price Nears $2 Mark XRP price traded at $2.02 at the time of reporting, crashing 8% intraday. Ripple’s native coin hit a low and high of $2.02 and $2.25 over the past day.

The attack, which occurred on February 21, saw hackers infiltrate one of Bybit’s cold wallets and steal over 41,000 ETH. This breach added to a growing list of high-profile cryptocurrency heists orchestrated by North Korean hacking entities. US Authorities Sound Alarm on North Korea’s Crypto Heists In a joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) issued by the FBI, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the US Treasury Department, authorities warned about the increasing cyber risks posed by North Korea-backed advanced persistent threat (APT) groups. The Lazarus Group, also known by aliases such as APT38, BlueNoroff, and Stardust Chollima, has been conducting cyber theft operations since at least 2020. The entity has been known for systematically targeting cryptocurrency exchanges, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, play-to-earn gaming platforms, as well as venture capital firms investing in digital assets. The advisory outlined the group’s tactics, which include social engineering, spearphishing campaigns, and the deployment of trojanized cryptocurrency applications to infiltrate networks and exfiltrate funds. According to US authorities, North Korean hackers use sophisticated malware strains, including the notorious AppleJeus malware, to compromise cryptocurrency platforms. These cyber actors frequently exploit vulnerabilities in financial technology firms and blockchain infrastructure to launder stolen digital assets, ultimately funneling funds back to the North Korean regime. “TraderTraitor” The Bybit hack follows a familiar pattern, with attackers using deceptive recruitment tactics to lure employees into downloading compromised trading applications, referred to as “TraderTraitor.” These applications are designed with cross-platform JavaScript and Node.js to make them appear legitimate but contain hidden malware that allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to private keys and initiate fraudulent blockchain transactions. With North Korea’s cyber theft operations continuing to escalate, the US government has reiterated its commitment to combating illicit activities in the cryptocurrency sector. The FBI urges cryptocurrency firms to strengthen cybersecurity measures, monitor for indicators of compromise (IOCs), and implement robust security protocols to mitigate risks associated with North Korean-backed cyber threats.

While skeptics have long criticized cryptocurrency’s lack of intrinsic value, RWA platforms fundamentally reshape this narrative by bringing tangible assets – from real estate to equities – onto the blockchain. Four key players exemplify the sector’s maturation and growing institutional adoption. Their success underscores a crucial reality – RWA operates as a complex two-sided marketplace, requiring both willing asset owners and sophisticated investors. As Wall Street takes interest, a new batch of regulations that nurture the burgeoning sector is crucial for long-term growth. Pendle Pendle offers perhaps the most innovative approach to yield-bearing assets. Unlike traditional products where ownership and yield are inseparable, Pendle’s model allows separate trading of PT (principal tokens) and YT (yield tokens). This flexibility has driven their total value locked to $5.9 billion, five times larger than that of their nearest competitor. Their fixed yields for popular products reach as high as 14.7% for USDe, attracting investors seeking stable returns in volatile markets. Ethena Ethena’s trajectory demonstrates the critical role of venture capital in shaping the RWA landscape. Following a $14 million Series A round that attracted investments from Franklin Templeton and Fidelity, they’ve secured strategic partnerships with World Liberty Financial and Deribit. Their synthetic dollar, sUSDe, offering a six percent APY, represents a new generation of yield-bearing assets designed for institutional adoption. Ondo Ondo Finance exemplifies the sector’s push toward mainstream integration. Through partnerships with BlackRock and Morgan Stanley, they’ve launched tokenized versions of blue-chip stocks and ETFs, including Coca-Cola (onKO) and SPDR Gold Shares (onGLD). Their recent announcement of Ondo Chain – purpose-built for institutional-grade RWAs – signals growing confidence in the sector’s future. What makes these developments particularly significant is their timing. As retail investors grow increasingly sophisticated and demand more stable investment vehicles, RWA platforms offer a compelling solution. When the average US home price stands at $356,585, fractional ownership through tokenization democratizes access to previously exclusive asset classes. The regulatory environment appears increasingly supportive – particularly in the US – where stablecoin legislation is gaining momentum. This could provide a substantial boost to yield-bearing assets like Ondo’s USDY, currently unavailable to US investors. Wall Street’s latest (and biggest?) bet The RWA transformation extends beyond traditional finance – innovative projects are exploring tokenization of everything from aviation financing to electric motorcycle fleets, demonstrating the versatility of RWA platforms. However, challenges remain. The sector must navigate complex regulatory requirements, ensure robust security measures and build sufficient liquidity across various asset classes. Success requires substantial capital – evidenced by the aggressive fundraising among leading platforms – to secure regulatory approvals and build institutional-grade infrastructure. Even with these challenges, traditional financial institutions are taking notice. The involvement of firms like BlackRock, Morgan Stanley and Fidelity isn’t merely symbolic – i t represents a fundamental shift in how Wall Street views digital assets. These partnerships provide crucial infrastructure and credibility, helping bridge the gap between traditional and DeFi (decentralized finance). Yet the trajectory is clear. RWA tokenization represents more than just another blockchain use case – it’s a fundamental reimagining of how we interact with traditional assets. By breaking down barriers to investment and creating more efficient markets, these platforms are driving what may be the most profound cultural and economic impact within the crypto space. As we move through 2025, the question isn’t whether RWA will transform finance, but rather which platforms will emerge as the dominant players in this new paradigm. For investors and institutions alike, understanding this evolution isn’t just advantageous – it’s essential. The next phase of growth will likely come from increased institutional adoption, regulatory clarity and innovative applications that push the boundaries of what can be tokenized.

According to the FBI, the Bybit hack, known as “TraderTraitor,” is part of a wider series of cyberattacks attributed to North Korean state-sponsored hackers. Meanwhile, forensic investigations by Sygnia Labs and Verichain confirmed that Bybit’s security infrastructure remained intact despite the breach. A detailed post-mortem of the hack revealed that the vulnerability was linked to a Safe Wallet developer machine that had been compromised. The attackers exploited this machine to insert malicious JavaScript code into the Gnosis Safe UI, specifically targeting Bybit’s cold wallet. Safe has affirmed that its smart contracts are safe, but the incident shows that hackers are increasingly focusing on infrastructure providers rather than exchanges themselves. Bybit has launched a website to track the laundering of its stolen funds and is offering a bounty to exchanges that assist in recovering the assets.

While some analysts hope for a price reversal to the upside, others predict a further crash to $70,000, eradicating almost all gains achieved after the US election rally. Popular crypto analyst and Co-founder of BitMEX Arthur Hayes has shared a bearish prediction for the Bitcoin price. Hayes projects a further breakdown in Bitcoin’s value, suggesting an imminent drop between $70,000 and $75,000. Bitcoin Price Crash To $70,000 A Possibility The crypto founder shared a 2-hour Bitcoin price chart from BitMEX, explaining how the pioneer cryptocurrency could experience this decline and citing macroeconomic factors tied to United States (US) President Donald Trump as a trigger for this price drawdown. Related Reading: End Of The Road For Bitcoin? Analyst Reveals When Price Will Crash To $50,000 Hayes suggests that the market is entering a cooling phase, characterized by a potential retracement to pre-election liquidity levels. A cooling phase is a period during which the price of a cryptocurrency declines and consolidates as the market attempts to stabilize. It typically comes after a cryptocurrency experiences an explosive price increase. Looking at his price chart, the BitMEX Co-founder pinpointed a demand zone around the blue-shaded area between $76,000 and $65,000. This price range serves as a critical support area, where traders expect significant buying interest, enough to prevent further price declines. Hayes believes that the Bitcoin price’s possible decline to $70,000 hinges on Trump’s budget and debt ceiling decision. He suggests that if Trump fails to pass a budget that increases spending and raises the debt ceiling, then further market capitulation could occur. This means that the market may undergo a rapid sell-off by a large number of investors, triggering a panic that could lead to further declines in the Bitcoin price. Additionally, if Trump’s influence over the Republican Party weakens, Hayes indicates that market uncertainty could grow, potentially triggering a continuation of the current Bitcoin downturn. Moreover, a debt ceiling reduction could negatively impact the market’s liquidation and fuel more price fluctuations. Overall, Haye’s bearish outlook for Bitcoin is tied to Trump’s fiscal influence. The BitMEX Co-founder suggests that, for now, the market can only “chill out, retrace, and wait.” BTC’s 3-Day Decline Marks Highest Since FTX Crash According to MetaEra, the recent 3-day decline in the Bitcoin price is the highest crash seen since the FTX fiasco in 2022. In the first three days of this week, Bitcoin recorded a 12.6% drop in value, pushing it down to its current price of $86,227. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Prediction: Analyst Charts Roadmap To $117,000, What You Should Know MetaEra revealed that the widespread market sell-off could be attributed to the negative sentiment and disappointment over President Trump’s lack of swift action regarding his promises to the crypto community. Prior to his election, Trump indicated a strong interest in creating a national Bitcoin Reserve and tightening fiat liquidity conditions. With no mention of plans concerning these crucial initiatives, uncertainty looms, leading to a weakened market sentiment.

But that’s not all. The SEC has now dropped its case against Consensys, the company behind the popular MetaMask wallet. This is a big win for Ethereum and the crypto community. Joseph Lubin, the founder of Consensys, celebrated the news, saying it was a victory for blockchain developers who deserve a fair chance to grow without unnecessary legal challenges. He also pointed out that this lawsuit played a part in getting the SEC to drop its investigation into Ethereum itself. “Every legal and policy win might be hard fought, but each is an important step along the path to a better financial system and a better internet. We appreciate the SEC’s new leadership and the pro-innovation, pro-investor path they are taking. We will remain deeply engaged with public and private policymakers going forward,” he wrote. These legal victories are part of a bigger trend where some regulators, like Hester Peirce, are working to clear out cases that don’t involve fraud, making room for crypto projects to thrive. While these wins are big, there are still ongoing cases, such as those with Kraken and Ripple. Many hope these cases will also be paused or dropped, much like what happened with others. I'm pleased to announce that Consensys and the SEC have agreed in principle that the securities enforcement case concerning MetaMask should be dismissed. Subject to the approval of the Commission, the SEC will file a stipulation with the court that effectively closes the case.… — Joseph Lubin (@ethereumJoseph) February 27, 2025 Lubin concluded, “Now we can get 100% back to building. 2025 is going to be the best year yet for Ethereum and Consensys. The paradigm shift to a much more decentralized world is accelerating.” The dropping of these cases is seen as very positive for the market. Institutional investors, who were hesitant to dive into crypto due to legal concerns, are now more likely to jump in.

The downturn comes amid heightened global trade war concerns fueled by Donald Trump’s new tariffs on the EU, Canada, and Mexico, leading to widespread investor panic. With over $700 million worth of liquidations in the past 24 hours and a 4% decline in total market capitalization to $2.7 trillion, traders remain on edge about the next move. Bitcoin price drops as market volatility surges Bitcoin’s price fell by more than 5% in the last 24 hours, reaching a low of $79,523 before stabilizing at $80,430, according to CoinMarketCap data . The decline resulted in $365.91 million in BTC liquidations, signaling heightened sell-offs. However, Bitcoin’s market dominance increased by 0.07%, suggesting altcoins bore the brunt of the selling pressure. Ethereum witnessed a sharp 7% drop, sinking to $2,132 with an intraday low of $2,128.18. The second-largest cryptocurrency faced $166.28 million in liquidations as traders reacted to broader market trends. Source: CoinMarketCap Altcoins face heavy sell-offs XRP plunged 7% to $2.04, with liquidations totaling $17.94 million. Solana (SOL) dropped 8%, trading at $128.42. Despite the sell-off, market expert Raoul Pal remains optimistic, citing oversold conditions. Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) plummeted 8% despite whale accumulation and increased SHIB burn rates. Pepe Coin (PEPE) and TRUMP Coin saw the biggest losses, declining 12%-16%. Top gainers and losers in today’s crypto market While most cryptos bled, a few tokens managed to stay in the green: Top Gainers: Berachain (BERA): +4% ($7.71) Litecoin (LTC): +2% ($124.81) UNUS SED LEO (LEO): +1% ($9.20) Top Losers: Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL): -12% ($1.01) Raydium (RAY): -12% ($2.13) Meanwhile, the Asian stock markets tumbled on Friday after US President Donald Trump confirmed tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China, rattling investor sentiment. Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped 0.9%, while the Topix fell 0.68% in early trading. South Korea’s Kospi tumbled 1.54%, with the Kosdaq down 1.69%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index lost 1.14%, while Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 slipped 0.86%. China’s CSI 300 remained largely flat as investors assessed the potential impact of additional US trade measures. This renewed trade uncertainty weighed heavily on US markets, with all three major indexes closing lower. The S&P 500 fell 1.59% to 5,861.57, extending its weekly losses. The Nasdaq Composite tumbled 2.78% to 18,544.42, dragged down by an 8.5% drop in Nvidia, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 193.62 points (0.45%) to close at 43,239.50. The crypto market continues to grapple with macroeconomic pressures and liquidity challenges, leading to heightened uncertainty. With Bitcoin and Ethereum at critical support levels, traders remain cautious, awaiting further market signals.

Adding to the momentum, ETH transaction fees have dropped to just $0.40 – the lowest since July 2020. This reduction in costs could provide the push needed for ETH to break past the $3,000 mark and beyond. Meanwhile, Bitcoin could also get a potential boost with the emergence of PlutoChain ($PLUTO). This project introduces smart contracts to Bitcoin, paving the way for deeper DeFi integration and expanding its real-world use cases beyond the current transactional one. Let’s check out the details. Ethereum’s Transaction Fees Drop to Multi-Year Lows – Is a Major Rally on the Horizon? Ethereum has once again made the news as its transaction fees have crashed to a stunning $0.40, a multi-year low last seen in 2020. This sharp drop, with the 7-day average tumbling 70% to $0.77 earlier this week, has slashed costs from January’s highs, sparking a wave of bullish excitement. ETH sits at $2,819, and with fees this cheap, analysts predict a price explosion as adoption soars. Ethereum 7-day chart, Source: CoinMarketCap Resistance at $2,800 and $2,925 is in sight, and the daily chart’s bullish triangle could catapult ETH past these if volume, now at $16 billion daily, roars back to January’s $25 billion peak. The RSI, hovering at 32-35, is primed for a bullish flip from oversold territory. The fee drop, tied to upgrades like Dencun, is a game-changer – lower costs mean more users, dApps, and DeFi action, historically a rocket for ETH’s price (think 2020-2021’s surge). All of this has led analysts to believe that a surge is ahead. Coin Signals points out that all of these events will lead to a price surge between $3,600-$5,800 while Dohimai sees a 20-22% increase by the end of March. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) Could Draw Whale Interest With its Innovative Layer-2 Blockchain For Bitcoin – Greatly Improves Speed, Scalability and Expansion PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could get whale attention with its clever take on a hybrid Layer-2 blockchain built to improve Bitcoin’s network. It keeps the security we all trust and increases the speed instead. Test runs show it can tackle over 43,200 transactions a day, pushing scalability to new heights. For Bitcoin, this means stepping beyond its “digital gold” role into something you’d actually use daily. Developers find a lot to like here. PlutoChain introduces smart contracts into Bitcoin’s toolkit, letting them craft decentralized apps with ease. It’s got Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility too, so they can port their Ethereum projects over to Bitcoin without any problems. Users have quick, low-cost transactions and DeFi features like lending or staking, all wrapped in Bitcoin’s sturdy framework. Bitcoin’s DeFi presence remains negligible compared to Ethereum’s $64 billion in Total Value Locked or Solana’s high-throughput network. PlutoChain could position Bitcoin to compete more effectively by combining its unmatched security with DeFi capabilities. While it’s not poised to overtake Ethereum or Solana outright, it strengthens Bitcoin’s presence in that sector. PlutoChain has undergone rigorous audits by reputable firms including SolidProof, QuillAudits, and Assure DeFi, ensuring its smart contracts and infrastructure meet high standards. Additionally, its decentralized governance model empowers community members to vote on protocol decisions – creating transparency and involvement. PlutoChain aims to enhance Bitcoin with speed, scalability, and expanded functionality, offering developers a robust platform and users practical advantages. As a Layer-2 solution, it could elevate Bitcoin’s potential in DeFi and beyond, making it a project worth watching. Conclusion Ethereum’s sharp drop in transaction fees to $0.40 could be the catalyst for its next major rally, with analysts predicting a surge past $3,000 and potentially up to $5,800. Lower fees historically drive adoption, fueling DeFi activity and network usage. At the same time, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could expand Bitcoin’s overall utility in areas such as DeFi and more by adding smart contracts support to its secure network. Audited and community-led, this project might bring a steady, intriguing upgrade to Bitcoin’s underdeveloped network. ——- Disclaimer: It’s important to note that participating in presales carries risks, including market volatility and potential project delays.

The past 24 hours tell a different story, with only 21,956,446 SHIB burnt, marking a 27.19% decline compared to the previous day. Despite this supply reduction, SHIB’s price remains under pressure, dropping 7.03% in the past 24 hours to trade at $0.00001341. The meme coin’s market cap has also taken a hit, falling 7.02% to $7.85 billion. With selling pressure mounting, investors are watching closely to see if the recent burn activity can counteract the prevailing bearish sentiment.

SHIB chart by TradingView SHIB faces strong resistance SHIB continues to face resistance at $0.000015, a level that has consistently prevented upward momentum. The latest price action suggests that traders remain cautious, with the token’s 24-hour decline of 7.03% reinforcing concerns about further downside movement. At the same time, SHIB’s total supply remains high at 589.25 trillion tokens, meaning burn events alone may not be enough to trigger significant price appreciation in the short term. On-chain data from Coinglass shows that SHIB futures open interest (OI) has dropped significantly, suggesting that traders are cutting exposure amid heightened volatility. Source: Coinglass With major liquidation areas identified at $0.00001413 on the lower end and $0.000015 on the upper side, market sentiment remains a key factor in determining SHIB’s next move. Source: Coinglass If the price continues to slide and reaches $0.00001413, nearly $350,000 worth of long positions could be liquidated. Conversely, a breakout to $0.000015 could see approximately $750,000 in short positions wiped out. The overall decline in trading volumes further signals a lack of strong buying interest at current levels. Can burn strategy support SHIB? While SHIB’s weekly burn rate has increased, the decline in daily burns raises questions about whether supply reductions alone can support a price rebound. The token’s value has now fallen over 7% in just 24 hours and more than 22% in the past month, showing that broader market trends continue to weigh on its performance. Historically, SHIB has relied on strong community engagement and speculative interest to fuel rallies. The latest pullback suggests that investor enthusiasm is fading, with reduced futures open interest indicating a cautious approach from traders. Without a major catalyst, SHIB may continue to struggle against key resistance levels. If market sentiment does not improve, SHIB could retest its support level at $0.000013, potentially leading to further losses. Meanwhile, traders will be monitoring whether burn activity can regain momentum, as a slowdown in token removals may further limit the chances of a sustained price recovery. The upcoming weeks will be critical in determining whether SHIB can regain traction or if the bearish trend will deepen further.

How Low Will BTC Price Go?,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-bitcoin-is-dropping-how-low-btc-price-will-drop/,"The post Why is Bitcoin Dropping? How Low Will BTC Price Go? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bloodshed in the crypto market doesn’t seem to be stopping as nearly $700 billion has been wiped out. In the past eight days, Bitcoin has fallen from $99,000 to $79,000, losing all the gains it made from the hype around President Trump’s pro-crypto policies. But what is causing this sudden drop, and how low can Bitcoin go? Bitcoin Hits a Four-Month Low Bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency, has fallen more than 5% in the last 24 hours, hitting a four-month low of $79,263 . One major reason for this drop is growing fear in the market due to President Trump’s tariff threats, which have created uncertainty in the economy. At the same time, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index has fallen to 21, its lowest level in nearly three years. This shows that many investors are scared and unsure about the market. Short-Term Holders Lose Over $2 Billion Many of the recent Bitcoin losses come from short-term holders (STHs) who have sold their Bitcoin in panic. In the last three days alone, these holders have lost $2.16 billion . Investors who bought Bitcoin in the last week lost $927 million. Those who bought in the last month lost $678 million. Holders who had Bitcoin for one to twelve months lost $257 million. Even those who bought in the last 24 hours lost $322 million. This shows that many new investors are losing confidence and rushing to sell. Meme Coins Under Regulatory Pressure The U.S. SEC recently said that meme coins are not securities. While this sounds like good news, it made the situation worse. Many meme coins rely on hype and social trends, and with Bitcoin dropping, meme coins have also crashed, adding more panic to the market. Disappointment with Trump’s Crypto Promises Bitcoin’s decline is also linked to disappointment with President Trump’s crypto plans. Many investors expected strong pro-crypto policies, but things are moving slower than expected. This has led to selling pressure on cryptocurrencies that gained from Trump’s support. Altcoins Also Suffer Heavy Losses Bitcoin’s drop has affected the whole market. Other major cryptocurrencies have also fallen. Ethereum (ETH) is down 7.5%, XRP has dropped 8.2%, and Solana (SOL) has fallen 9%. This shows that investors are losing trust in the crypto market. How Low Can Bitcoin Go? Bitcoin’s price drop has made traders worried. Some believe Bitcoin needs to fill a gap near $80,000 before recovering. Meanwhile, Crypto analyst AlphaBTC thinks that if Bitcoin fills this gap, it could start a new rally. But if it doesn’t, the price could fall further to $73,000. At the same time, Bitcoin options data shows that more traders are betting on Bitcoin dropping to $70,000. This suggests that some investors believe the market could get even worse.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-28 05:08:22

ADA is now consolidating losses and at risk of more losses below the $0.60 level. ADA price started a fresh decline below the $0.6850 and $0.650 levels. The price is trading below $0.6550 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.660 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears the $0.70 resistance zone. Cardano Price Dips Further After a decent increase, Cardano faced resistance near the $0.70 zone. ADA formed a short-term top and recently started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . There was a move below the $0.6850 and $0.6650 levels. The bears were able to push the price below $0.6350. A low was formed at $0.6016 and the price is now consolidating losses. It is still below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $0.6769 swing high to the $0.6016 low. Cardano price is now trading below $0.650 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.620 zone. The first resistance is near $0.640 and the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $0.6769 swing high to the $0.6016 low. The next key resistance might be $0.660. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.660 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. If there is a close above the $0.660 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $0.680 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $0.70 in the near term. More Losses in ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $0.660 resistance level, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $0.60 level. The next major support is near the $0.5850 level. A downside break below the $0.5850 level could open the doors for a test of $0.550. The next major support is near the $0.50 level where the bulls might emerge. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ADA/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.

Is it the community, the hype, or the potential for massive gains? This week, three trending meme coins are catching the attention of investors looking for opportunities. BTFD Coin (BTFD) continues its record-breaking presale, Just A Chill Guy (CHILLGUY) is riding a 25.9% weekly surge, and Bonk (BONK) is stabilizing after its latest 3.5% gain. Meme coins have evolved beyond just internet jokes—they’ve become serious contenders in the crypto space. BTFD Coin is redefining investor incentives with its referral program and massive staking rewards, while Just A Chill Guy embraces the chill meme culture and Bonk continues to dominate Solana’s meme scene. Let’s break down what makes these three meme coins some of the best cryptos for beginners right now . BTFD Coin: Bulls Squad Expands as Referral Rewards Boost Investors Can a single meme coin redefine the way people invest in crypto? BTFD Coin is making a strong case for it. The presale has already raised over $6.21 million, with more than 70 billion tokens sold and a community of 11,100+ holders growing daily. Unlike traditional meme coins, BTFD is packed with real-world utility, including a play-to-earn (P2E) game, staking rewards of up to 90% APY, and an explosive referral program—one of the key reasons it’s among the best cryptos for beginners right now. The BTFD referral program is turning heads, giving investors 10% of the raise amount in BTFD tokens if they rank in the top 20 referrers. This means that active community members can earn a significant portion of their investment back just by spreading the word. With its Stage 14 price at just $0.00016, investors see the opportunity for a potential 3650% ROI when it lists at $0.006—a moonshot that’s drawing in new buyers by the minute. Investing in BTFD Coin now could be like getting in early on a future meme coin giant. A $10,000 investment at $0.00016 would secure over 62.5 million BTFD tokens, which at the projected $0.006 moon price could be worth $375,000. This kind of upside is what’s keeping investors glued to the presale. Buying BTFD Coin is simple. Set up MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load it with BNB or ETH, connect to the presale site , enter the purchase amount, confirm the transaction, and receive tokens once the presale ends.

There’s an absolute bloodbath on the Satoshi Street with BTC and other digital assets extending weekly losses to more than 20-25%. Crypto Market Crash Erases $900 Billion Ever since US President Donald Trump kickstarted the trade war on January 20, the crypto market crash led to erasing more than $900 billion in just over a month’s time. Since the Trump inauguration, the total crypto market cap has dropped from $3.7 trillion to $2.8 trillion. On the monthly chart, Bitcoin price is down more than 21% after facing rejection at $106K levels. BTC losses have further exacerbated after the asset lost the crucial support of $95K. Below is the chart of how Bitcoin has behaved after Trump announces trade wars with Mexico, Canada, and recently Europe. Source: The Kobeissi Letter Gold Takes the Limelight Over Bitcoin The recent development shows that BTC has been subject to market uncertainties and has behaved exactly opposite to the yellow metal gold, which has been trending higher. Throughout the trade war, the price of gold continued to inch higher, extending its year-to-date gains to nearly 10%. Gold has reclaimed its position as a favored global hedge amid uncertainty. Last week, Gold ETFs purchased an impressive 52 tonnes of the metal, marking the highest weekly inflow since July 2020. Over the past 12 months, gold prices have surged by more than 50%, recently achieving their best annual performance in over a decade. Source: The Kobeissi Letter How Low Can Bitcoin Price Fall? Crypto analyst Justin Bennett suggests that Bitcoin may be on track to close the $77,360 CME gap from November, potentially aligning with the September 2023 trendline. In a recent post, Bennett expressed skepticism about Bitcoin’s ability to maintain its current levels. “For Bitcoin to avoid a bearish outlook, it would need a miraculous February close above $92,000,” Bennett stated. However, he added, “The odds aren’t looking good.” Source: Justin Bennet BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes stated: “We are making lower lows in this current wave. I was tempted to add risk this morning, but looking at this price action I think we have one more violent wave down below $80k, most likely over the weekend, then crickets for a while”. On the other hand, CryptoQuant CEO still believes that the Bitcoin bull run hasn’t ended, and it is very unlikely that the Bitcoin price will fall under $77,000, in this crypto market crash. Ethereum (ETH) Leads Altcoins Crash to $2,100 Ethereum has been leading altcoins market crash, dropping an additional 8% today and moving all the way to $2,100. With today’s drop, ETH has completely erased its post-election rally. Ethereum has declined by nearly 50% from its peak following the late-2024 election. As of press time, ETH price is trading 7.74% down at $2,136, losing $30 billion in the last 24 hours. Source: TradingView Apart from ETH, some of the other top altcoins have also lost anywhere between 8-10%. XRP price has crashed 8% today, moving all the way to $2.0. Solana (SOL) also dropped by 8% to $126 levels, with dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA) seeing correction of a similar magnitude losing crucial support levels. In today’s crypto market crash, the overall crypto market liquidation has soared to more than $860 million as per Coinglass data . Of the total liquidations, $707 million has been in long liquidations alone. Crypto Market Faces Major Liquidity Crisis Tight liquidity conditions in the market have been the key reason behind the steep fall in the crypto market recently. Of the total monthly market correction, $760 billion have been eroded just within the last 60 hours, noted The Kobeissi Letter, in the absence of liquidity. Source: The Kobeissi Letter Much of the global liquidity is finding its way back into the US Dollar during ongoing trade tensions. Often seen as the “safest risky asset,” the USD benefits from its reputation as one of the world’s most stable currencies. Thus, the USD has been sucking out the liquidity from crypto and the rest og global markets.

In Texas, the Senate Banking Committee has advanced a bill that could establish a Bitcoin and cryptocurrency strategic reserve, positioning the state as a leader in digital asset adoption. Meanwhile, at the national level, Standard Chartered has projected that Bitcoin could reach $200,000 this year and potentially $500,000 before the end of President Donald Trump’s second term, citing increasing institutional adoption and evolving regulatory clarity. Bitcoin’s Path to $500K? Standard Chartered Sees Trump’s Presidency as a Net Positive for BTC The first month of Donald Trump’s presidency has been anything but stable for risk assets, but his administration could prove to be a long-term boon for Bitcoin, according to Standard Chartered. Despite recent volatility, the bank sees significant upside for the leading cryptocurrency, predicting a price surge to $200,000 this year and an eventual climb to $500,000 before the end of Trump’s second term. Geoffrey Kendrick, head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, made the bold projection in a recent interview with CNBC. He attributed the potential rally to growing institutional adoption and an increasingly favorable regulatory environment, both of which could propel Bitcoin to unprecedented heights. “It’s institutions like ours that now offer custody businesses that are much more secure than the hacks,” Kendrick noted. This sentiment reflects a broader trend where traditional financial institutions are playing a more active role in crypto markets. The approval and launch of multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US have driven institutional demand, reinforcing the narrative that Bitcoin is becoming a mainstream financial asset. While the long-term outlook appears optimistic, Bitcoin’s short-term price action has been far from smooth. After reaching an all-time high of $109,000 in January, BTC has since retraced to around $80,000, weighed down by macroeconomic concerns and geopolitical tensions. President Trump’s aggressive trade policies—particularly his renewed tariff threats against China, Canada, and Mexico—have rattled global markets, contributing to Bitcoin’s recent correction. The Kobeissi Letter, a well-regarded market commentary platform, pointed out that Bitcoin’s sharp reaction to tariff threats shows its growing correlation with equities and broader liquidity conditions. Historically viewed as a hedge against traditional markets, Bitcoin now appears more intertwined with macroeconomic events than ever before. Despite the short-term turbulence, industry experts believe Bitcoin remains in a strong bull cycle. Global Macro Investor analyst Julien Bittel emphasized that corrections are normal in bull markets, particularly following a sharp run-up in price after the US presidential election. Meanwhile, Jamie Coutts, chief crypto analyst at Real Vision, highlighted that two out of three key liquidity indicators have turned bullish despite the recent downturn. Expanding central bank balance sheets and increasing global money supply typically create a favorable backdrop for Bitcoin’s price appreciation. The final piece of the puzzle, according to Coutts, is the US dollar’s trajectory—if the greenback weakens, Bitcoin’s upward momentum could accelerate. Security Concerns Remain a Challenge While institutional players are bringing credibility and legitimacy to the crypto sector, security risks remain a major concern. The recent $1.4-billion hack of crypto exchange Bybit is a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities still present in digital asset markets. Standard Chartered’s prediction of a $500,000 Bitcoin hinges on a combination of factors, including regulatory clarity, institutional investment, and macroeconomic shifts. If Trump’s policies lead to greater financial uncertainty or currency devaluation, Bitcoin could benefit as investors seek non-traditional stores of value. As the crypto market continues to evolve, Bitcoin’s ability to weather volatility and attract mainstream adoption will be critical in determining whether it can reach—and sustain—these ambitious price targets. Texas Moves Forward With Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Bill, Setting Precedent for US States In related news, the Texas Senate Banking Committee unanimously approved Senate Bill 21 (SB-21), which proposes the establishment of a Bitcoin and cryptocurrency strategic reserve. The 9–0 vote on Feb. 27 clears the path for the bill to advance to the Texas Senate floor for further deliberation, where it could become one of the most significant state-level cryptocurrency policies in the US. If passed, the bill would authorize the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts to acquire, sell, and trade digital assets as part of the state’s financial reserves. Advocates argue that Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies offer a hedge against inflation and economic volatility, providing Texans with enhanced financial security. The passage of SB-21 in the committee follows growing interest among US states in adopting Bitcoin as a financial safeguard. Oklahoma, Arizona, and Utah are also considering similar legislation to diversify their state reserves, reflecting broader concerns over the declining purchasing power of the US dollar and rising inflation. The bill originally focused exclusively on Bitcoin when it was first introduced by Texas State Senator Charles Schwertner in January 2025. However, following US President Donald Trump’s executive order on Jan. 23, which directed a commission to study the feasibility of a ”digital asset stockpile,” the bill was revised to include other digital assets in February. This shift aligns with Trump’s broader crypto-friendly stance, reinforcing his administration’s push to integrate digital assets into state and national economic strategies. While the move has been widely celebrated among Bitcoin supporters, some analysts remain cautious. Iliya Kalchev, an analyst at crypto platform Nexo, noted that the Feb. 18 public hearing for SB-21 was more symbolic than an immediate Bitcoin adoption or price catalyst. However, Pierre Rochard, vice president of research at Riot Platforms, a major Bitcoin mining company, provided testimony in support of the bill. He highlighted that while Texas currently enjoys a strong economy, it must prepare for future economic downturns and fiscal uncertainty. ”Public trust in financial institutions has eroded due to a lack of transparency, but Bitcoin is unique because it is fully auditable,” Rochard emphasized. His testimony echoed growing concerns that traditional financial systems are becoming increasingly fragile, with government overspending, debt accumulation, and inflation threatening long-term economic stability. Texas: A Crypto and Bitcoin Mining Hub Texas has long been a pro-crypto state, hosting some of the largest Bitcoin mining operations in the US due to its low electricity costs and deregulated energy market. The state has also enacted pro-mining legislation and has positioned itself as a leader in blockchain innovation. The introduction of a Bitcoin-backed reserve fund would further cement Texas’ status as a Bitcoin-friendly jurisdiction, potentially attracting even more investment and crypto businesses. However, challenges remain. If passed, the bill would require Texas to develop a framework for securely managing digital assets, including issues related to custody, price volatility, and regulatory oversight. Texas’ move to establish a Bitcoin strategic reserve could set a precedent for other US states to follow. If successful, it may lead to wider state-level Bitcoin adoption and force federal regulators to reassess their stance on Bitcoin and crypto-backed reserves. The potential expansion of state-level Bitcoin adoption also signals a shift in how policymakers view digital assets—not just as speculative investments but as legitimate financial instruments capable of hedging against inflation and financial instability. If Bitcoin is increasingly recognized as a strategic reserve asset, it could pave the way for broader government adoption, including federal reserves or even sovereign Bitcoin holdings in the future. The unanimous approval of SB-21 by the Texas Senate Banking Committee is a historic milestone in Bitcoin's integration into traditional financial systems. While some analysts remain skeptical about its immediate impact, the bill represents a growing recognition of Bitcoin’s role in financial security. With Trump’s executive order pushing for further digital asset integration, Texas may be at the forefront of a new era of Bitcoin adoption at the state level. If passed into law, SB-21 could mark the beginning of Bitcoin’s formal role in state financial reserves, setting the stage for broader institutional and governmental acceptance in the years ahead.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|REGULATION|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-28 05:30:00
33767162,[object Object],1740720627,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Panic Selling Bitcoin Now Is A Mistake – Crypto Expert Explains Market Dynamics,https://bitcoinist.com/panic-selling-bitcoin-now-is-a-mistake-crypto-expert-explains-market-dynamics/,"Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading below key demand levels after losing the $90K mark earlier this week. The price has tagged fresh lows, and bulls have lost control as the market faces intense selling pressure. BTC has dropped 14% in less than three days, entering a panic selling phase as investors react to market uncertainty. The sudden drop has sparked fear and speculation, with some analysts calling for a bear market while others remain optimistic about BTC’s long-term outlook. Despite this sharp correction, some crypto experts argue that panic selling at this stage is a rookie mistake. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju shared key metrics on X displaying BTC’s price drawdown after price discovery, pointing out that these types of corrections are historically normal in bull markets. According to Ju, if you’re panic selling now, you’re probably a noob—implying that this is a typical shakeout designed to flush out weak hands before the next rally. With Bitcoin’s price struggling below $90K , the next few days will be crucial to determine whether BTC stabilizes and recovers or continues to break lower toward deeper demand levels. Bitcoin Faces A Correction Phase Bitcoin has faced its biggest correction of the year, with the price struggling below the $90K level as investor fear and uncertainty dominate the market. The sudden drop has shaken confidence, and speculation about a potential bear market is rising as BTC sets new lows. Despite the sharp decline, top analysts are still watching for key confirmation levels. The market is at a critical point, where BTC could either consolidate below $90K for an extended period or see a strong push above $95K to confirm a recovery rally. The next few days will be crucial in determining whether Bitcoin stabilizes or faces further downside pressure. Ki Young Ju’s key insights about the correction explain that a 30% pullback in a Bitcoin bull cycle is common. He reminds investors that in 2021, BTC dropped 53% during its bull market yet still recovered to reach a new all-time high. Ju warns against emotional trading, stating that buying when prices rise and selling when they fall is the worst investment strategy. Ju emphasizes that investors should have a clear plan rather than reacting impulsively. While the recent price action looks scary, historical trends suggest that this type of correction is normal in a long-term Bitcoin bull run. BTC Testing Fresh Demand Level Bitcoin is currently trading at $86,400, hovering just above the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and 5% away from the 200-day Moving Average (MA). These key indicators serve as long-term support levels, and holding above them is crucial for bulls to prevent further downside. If BTC stabilizes at these levels, the next major step in reclaiming bullish momentum would be pushing above the $90K level. However, the market remains highly volatile, and this process could take time before the next major rally takes off. Investors are closely monitoring price action to see if Bitcoin can sustain a recovery phase or if another wave of selling pressure will push it into lower demand zones. Historically, when Bitcoin tests the 200-day MA, it often leads to a period of consolidation before a significant move. If bulls manage to reclaim the $90K mark and hold it as support, this would signal a potential uptrend resumption. However, failure to hold current levels could result in further declines, with $82K–$84K as the next key demand zone. For now, traders are waiting to see whether Bitcoin can defend its current levels or if a longer consolidation phase is needed before a breakout occurs.

According to MakroVision, Ethereum remains weak after falling below the lower orange support zone. ETH is currently trading near the lower Fibonacci support levels, making a reversal at this stage crucial to avoid further downside pressure. According to the analytics firm, if Ethereum manages to bounce, the key breakout zone is located between $2,810 and $2,880, along with a red trendline. This range serves as a crucial area for a potential trend reversal as it also houses several liquidity zones that could attract price action.

The announcement, made on Feb. 28 through Metamask’s official X account, marks a major update for the wallet, which has primarily focused on the Ethereum ( ETH ) ecosystem. The update will include a redesigned user interface, the ability to manage several seed phrases in a single wallet, and abstracted gas fees, which will enable users to pay for transactions using any token rather than ETH. We're overhauling the MetaMask UI/UX. 🦊 Not only that, we're bringing in developments that will level up the entire industry. Here's what we've been cooking. 🧵👇 pic.twitter.com/tPlKdWr9Bz — MetaMask.eth 🦊 (@MetaMask) February 28, 2025 In addition, the platform plans to launch smart transactions, a feature designed to prevent unsuccessful transactions and restrict MEV assaults. After Ethereum’s next Pectra upgrade, MetaMask will also introduce smart account features that will enhance the self-custody procedure. This version will make MetaMask a cross-chain wallet that prioritizes security and usability while managing assets from many blockchains.

As previously reported by crypto.news on Feb. 27, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has dropped its investigation on the Ethereum development company. Consensys was accused of operating as an unregistered securities broker, as part of a larger crackdown led by former SEC Chair Gary Gensler. However, the agency has softened its position and dismissed cases against Uniswap, Gemini, Coinbase, OpenSea, and Robinhood since interim Chair Mark Uyeda assumed office. Consensys founder and Ethereum co-creator Joseph Lubin called the decision a victory for the cryptocurrency industry. I'm pleased to announce that Consensys and the SEC have agreed in principle that the securities enforcement case concerning MetaMask should be dismissed. Subject to the approval of the Commission, the SEC will file a stipulation with the court that effectively closes the case.… — Joseph Lubin (@ethereumJoseph) February 27, 2025 Despite MetaMask’s continued dominance in the self-custody wallet market, competition is intensifying. Phantom, the most popular wallet on Solana ( SOL ), has grown to 15 million users since its launch in 2021. Phantom began as a Solana-only wallet but has since branched out to the Ethereum ecosystem. MetaMask’s recent roadmap indicates an attempt to hold on to its top spot in the rapidly changing cryptocurrency wallet space.

The US SEC has made it clear that meme coins , like TRUMP and other popular tokens, are not considered securities or investments that need to follow strict financial rules. Instead, the agency sees them more like collectibles—something people buy for fun rather than as a real financial asset. However, just because meme coins aren’t regulated like stocks doesn’t mean scammers can get away with fraud. The SEC warned that if someone uses meme coins to mislead people or run scams, they could still face legal trouble. The SEC has released guidance that memecoins are not securities and are akin to collectibles. https://t.co/8tRsuHHqbJ — David Sacks (@davidsacks47) February 27, 2025 Meme Coins: Not Securities, Says SEC According to the SEC’s latest statement , meme coins do not meet the legal definition of securities under the Securities Act of 1933. Unlike stocks or investment contracts, Meme coins don’t give holders any rights to future profits, income, or ownership in a company. Because of this, the SEC doesn’t require meme coin creators or traders to register with them, meaning they don’t have to follow the same rules as traditional investments. However, this also means investors won’t get the usual protections from the SEC, exposing them to the risk of fraud, pump-dump schemes, and misleading advertising. Legal experts, including Bain Capital Crypto’s Khurram Dara, highlighted that even though the SEC won’t directly regulate meme coins, other federal or state agencies could take action against deceptive practices to protect investors. A New Bill Emerges Before the SEC’s statement, House Democrats had already been pushing the Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement (MEME) Act, aimed at restricting public officials from launching or endorsing meme coins. The bill, spearheaded by California Representative Sam Liccardo, came in response to Donald Trump’s controversial “ TRUMP” meme coin , which saw a dramatic rise and fall in value. Lawmakers fear that such tokens could be exploited for personal or political gain, raising ethical concerns. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto News: Consensys Wins Big as SEC Drops Case Over MetaMask Wallet , Crypto Community Reacts The SEC’s stance has sparked mixed reactions in the crypto space. Some industry players see it as a positive move, arguing that regulatory clarity will encourage more investment in meme coins, particularly on US-based blockchains like Solana . Crypto lawyer Ishmael Green noted that with meme coins officially outside securities laws, exchanges like Coinbase and Robinhood may feel more confident listing them, which could lead to a surge in market activity. Following the announcement, shares of major crypto exchanges saw a slight uptick, reflecting optimism within the industry. Meanwhile, in a surprising turn, the SEC is dropping its lawsuits against Coinbase, Consensys, and Gemini, signaling a positive change for crypto assets. With the MEME Act on the horizon and the SEC shifting gears, the regulations scene for crypto—especially meme coins—is changing fast. Whether these changes bring more clarity or confusion remains to be seen. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

40944970,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=683974,1740721664,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40944970.jpeg,Judge blocks Elon Musk’s DOGE from mass-firing federal workers,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/judge-blocks-elon-musk-doge-firing/,"On Thursday, Federal Judge William Alsup told the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to cancel its earlier orders from Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) that told agencies to “promptly determine” whether certain employees should stay or be fired. The judge didn’t just stop the terminations—he called the entire process illegal and said it should have never happened in the first place. The OPM had sent out a January 20 memo and a February 14 internal email, both pushing agencies to decide the fate of probationary employees. Alsup wasn’t having it. He ordered OPM to notify the Department of Defense that those terminations were invalid—and he wants this done before the planned firings happen. He also ordered a hearing, where acting OPM Director Charles Ezell will have to testify. No date has been set yet. Judge: OPM had no right to order mass firings Alsup made it clear that OPM had no legal authority to force these agencies to fire employees. “The Office of Personnel Management does not have any authority whatsoever under any statute in the history of the universe to hire and fire employees within another agency,” he said. “It can hire its own employees, yes. Can fire them. But it cannot order or direct some other agency to do so.” He also called probationary workers “the lifeblood of our government”—people who enter at lower levels and move up over time. The government, he said, depends on them to keep things running. The lawsuit against DOGE came from unions, including the American Federation of Labor, arguing that Musk’s agency was violating the Privacy Act and the Administrative Procedure Act by trying to access Labor Department data. Judge John Bates of Washington, D.C., ordered at least one DOGE official to testify and hand over documents, marking the first time someone inside D.O.G.E has been legally forced to answer questions under oath from an outside attorney. Bates called D.O.G.E “opaque”, meaning the agency operates with little transparency. The ruling could reveal how DOGE really functions inside the federal system and what data it has access to. DOGE under fire for secrecy and overreach Bates also approved four depositions with staffers at the Department of Health and Human Services, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Labor Department, and D.O.G.E. The unions pushing the case want proof that D.O.G.E is illegally accessing federal records. The judge ruled that these depositions should be limited to eight hours total, but it’s unclear if the public will ever see them. The unions that filed the lawsuit are seeking to block DOGE from accessing Labor Department data, arguing that access to such sensitive information systems would violate the Privacy Act and the Administrative Procedure Act. Another case against DOGE, filed by the Center for Biological Diversity, argues that the agency is dodging federal transparency laws. This group, which focuses on protecting the environment, says the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has refused to release information on D.O.G.E’s actions, despite Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) rules requiring federal agencies to disclose records upon request. D.O.G.E has faced over 20 lawsuits , but this is the first one focused entirely on transparency laws. The Center for Biological Diversity suit claims that because DOGE is deliberately moving quickly to cut government funding and staff, and its efforts will have effects on the environment (the Environmental Protection Agency has said D.O.G.E helped it make significant cuts, for instance), it’s urgent to uncover more details about how D.O.G.E operates. The FOIA lawsuit argues that the government should not be allowed to make drastic staffing cuts in secrecy. “FOIA was designed to ensure that monumental and consequential undertakings such as this could not take place without transparency,” the lawsuit says. It also warns that D.O.G.E’s staffing cuts could “harm, undermine, or negate” federal climate protections, land management, and public health regulations. Government argues it was just ‘guidance’ There was a major dispute over whether OPM’s mid-February calls to agencies were actual orders or just “requests”. Alsup wasn’t convinced. He pointed out that when something happens at the same time across multiple agencies, it sounds more like an order than mere “guidance.” “Something aberrational happens, not just in one agency, but all across the government, in many agencies on the same day, the same thing,” Alsup said. “Doesn’t that sound like to you that somebody ordered it to happen, as opposed to, ‘Oh, we just got guidance’?” Assistant U.S. Attorney Kelsey Helland, the government’s lawyer, disagreed. “An order is not usually phrased as a request,” she argued. “Asking is not ordering to do something.” She suggested that impacted employees should take their cases to the Office of Special Counsel or the Merit Systems Protection Board instead of seeking a restraining order. Danielle Leonard, an attorney for the unions, pushed back. “Are they really contending to this court that all of these federal employees are lying, Your Honor?” she asked. “That’s what counsel is saying. I don’t think it’s credible.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Both the stock market and crypto assets like Bitcoin are showing significant declines. This week, Bitcoin ETFs saw massive outflows. On Monday, over $500 million left, followed by a staggering $11 billion outflow on Tuesday, the largest in history. Wednesday saw another record with $754 million leaving the Bitcoin ETFs, particularly affecting the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF. In response to the outflows, BlackRock had to sell a record amount of Bitcoin on Wednesday to fulfill the withdrawal requests, marking the largest single-day Bitcoin sale for the ETF provider. As for Bitcoin price, the largest cryptocurrency has dipped below $80,000 and most altcoins have followed suit. XRP is down by more than 9% and is dangerously close to dropping below the $2 mark. Over the last 24 hours, XRP has confirmed a daily candle close below a crucial support zone between $2.25 and $2.30. According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, this area has previously shown multiple bounces, making it a key level for traders. With this break, the next significant support lies between $1.95 and $2. Next Major Support at $2 If the price drops below the $2 level, specifically under $1.95 or $1.90, it could signal more major losses for XRP. This would likely lead to much lower price levels in the near future. Current Bearish Trend XRP is currently in a bearish trend, marked by breaking below support levels, rejecting resistance, and forming lower highs and lows. This bearish price action suggests further downward movement in the short term.

The lawsuit, claiming XRP was sold as an unregistered security, has drawn attention as the SEC recently dropped several high-profile cases. If the SEC dismisses the appeal, XRP’s price could surge, with analysts predicting a potential rally to $3.20 following Ripple’s previous legal victories. February 28, 2025 06:13:02 UTC Pi Network Listing on Binance Gains Support with 86% Community Vote Binance has completed a community vote that may lead to the listing of Pi Coin (PI) on the platform. With 86% of the 294,957 participants voting in favor, this marks a significant move toward integrating Pi Network’s native cryptocurrency into Binance’s offerings. However, Binance clarified that the vote results are for reference only, and the decision will be subject to further evaluation. Pi Coin, which has grown to over 60 million members, saw a 20.8% price drop following its ATH but has still outperformed the broader crypto market. The Pi Network community is also looking forward to Pi Day on March 14, 2025, which could bring further excitement and developments for the coin. February 28, 2025 06:07:13 UTC When Will Crypto Go Back Up? After recent corrections, the market appears to have found a solid demand zone, potentially setting up for a bounce. Bitcoin ($BTC) could reach $97K-$100K, Ethereum ($ETH) may hit $3K, and altcoins could experience a 10%-30% rally. This bounce may be triggered not only by technical factors but also by NVIDIA’s record-breaking earnings and the upcoming US PCE Price Index data. Investors are watching closely as the Fed evaluates its policies based on this data, which could influence market movements further. February 28, 2025 05:46:55 UTC Bitcoin News Today : BTC Price Crash Below $80K Bitcoin’s spot volume surged around the $100K mark, but during distribution phases, prices tend to drop when new liquidity dries up. The key question now is where fresh liquidity will come from to sustain a bullish trend. With limited new liquidity entering the market, an extended consolidation within a wide range ($75K-$100K) seems likely, similar to early 2024. This range-bound movement could persist until favorable news for Bitcoin triggers new liquidity inflows. February 28, 2025 05:46:55 UTC What Happened To Crypto Today? Bitcoin (BTC) fell below its 200-day simple moving average (SMA) on Friday, marking a 16% weekly loss and briefly dipping below $80,000 for the first time since November 10. The decline was fueled by renewed concerns over U.S. tariffs, which boosted demand for the U.S. dollar. Altcoin like XRP, Solana (SOL), and DOGE saw even steeper losses, with XRP dropping below the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level. President Trump’s announcement of tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China further fueled the rise in the dollar, pushing the dollar index to 107.30.",News|Crypto Live News Today,EN,0,0,BTC|XRP|MARKET|TRADING|SOL|ALTCOIN|BNB|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-28 05:58:28

The proposed legislation seeks to ban senior US officials and their family members from engaging in the issuance, sponsorship, or endorsement of digital assets, securities, and commodities. This move comes in direct response to the launch of the $TRUMP meme coin, a cryptocurrency tied to former President Donald Trump, which has faced significant volatility since its debut. Although the MEME Act is unlikely to pass under the current Republican-led Congress, its introduction signals growing concern over political figures leveraging digital assets for personal financial gain. If Democrats regain control in the 2026 midterm elections, the bill’s prospects could improve, potentially forcing Trump to return any profits made from the controversial token. The debate raises broader questions about regulatory oversight and ethical boundaries in the crypto space, particularly as political figures increasingly embrace Web3. Trump-linked tokens spark concerns The timing of the $TRUMP and $MELANIA tokens’ launches—just days before the US presidential inauguration—has fueled accusations of financial exploitation. Source: Coingecko The $TRUMP coin saw an initial surge to over $74, only to crash 82% from its peak, while the $MELANIA token has plummeted 93% from its all-time high. Source: Coingecko Despite Trump’s previous advocacy for a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment, his direct association with these digital assets has drawn criticism. Investors who suffered heavy losses have taken to social media, questioning whether political figures should have such influence over speculative markets. The volatility of these tokens has also raised concerns about potential insider trading and foreign financial influence over the executive branch. This is not the first time the former president has ventured into the Web3 space. Trump previously launched a series of NFTs, a move that mirrored a broader trend of politicians experimenting with blockchain-based assets. With the MEME Act now on the table, lawmakers are signalling that such activities by public officials may soon face stricter scrutiny. Crypto bill faces legislative hurdles While the MEME Act has little chance of passing in the current political climate, its introduction highlights the increasing legislative focus on cryptocurrency ethics. The bill’s failure would not necessarily mean the issue will fade, as calls for greater transparency and accountability in political finance continue to grow. Regulating the participation of elected officials in crypto markets could set a precedent for broader industry-wide reforms. Some analysts argue that, even if the MEME Act does not pass, its proposed restrictions on digital asset endorsements could inspire similar measures in future financial regulation bills. A complete ban on political involvement in digital currencies is unlikely, but lawmakers may push for disclosure requirements and independent oversight as alternative solutions. This could help ensure that public officials are held accountable while allowing legitimate crypto industry growth to continue. Regulation aims to restore trust The MEME Act underscores a broader debate about the ethical implications of public servants engaging in speculative investments. Trust in democratic institutions relies on a clear separation between political power and personal financial gain, yet the growing involvement of politicians in crypto-related ventures blurs these lines. With increasing regulatory efforts in the cryptocurrency space, from Biden’s executive order on digital assets to Europe’s MiCA framework, the MEME Act is part of a global movement towards ensuring that financial markets operate transparently. Whether the legislation moves forward or not, it has sparked an important conversation about the role of elected officials in emerging financial markets. Ultimately, the battle over cryptocurrency regulation is far from over. As digital assets continue to evolve, lawmakers will need to balance market innovation with ethical governance, ensuring that no public figure can exploit their political influence for private financial gain.

With market trends evolving, investors are eyeing the best new crypto projects that bring innovation and real-world utility. Among the high potential crypto opportunities, DexBoss, Aureal One, and three other coins stand out as promising contenders. These top altcoin picks could offer significant returns. Let’s explore these projects. Top 5 Best Coins to Buy Now with High Growth Potential As the market of digital currencies keeps on expanding, it’s getting increasingly harder for investors to find such assets that have bright future. Projects like DexBoss ($DEBO) and Aureal One ($DLUME) are two that have shown themselves to be out of the ordinary in the scene. These funders don’t just allow their platforms to be used as a vehicle for the innovative ideas of their users but also have presales where gains for the investors are still within reach. Following are the five alternative cryptocurrencies that you ought to think about as an investment that will pave the way to a very promising future for the company: DexBoss ($DEBO) Aureal One ($DLUME) Polygon ($MATIC) Avalanche ($AVAX) Chainlink ($LINK) 1. DexBoss ($DEBO) The first token had the vision to exist on the two sides and the same as its traditional finance (DEFI) analog and thus, it makes a good way of fixing the long standing issues trading is facing. This presale is very well-crafted. The reason for this is the arrangements made that are designed to attract the required amount of $50 million which will allow early investors to purchase the token with prices that are going up slowly from $0.01. It is one of the numerous platforms with the most cryptocurrencies I have come across. Click here to know more about DexBoss This platform offers a lot of different major features such as liquidity farming and margin trading that are mainly used for trading ecosystems that are profitable. Also, the buyback-burn system will alter the value of the token with the use of $DEBO. This will happen since the supply of the tokens will have been reduced in time and the funds raised by this move will be invested properly. These fundamentals are good examples of the principle of the stock in the end. This is the current trend even though the outcomes realized are not as planned because a fairly low base is the primary reason for the downswing of the potential winnings. 2. Aureal One ($DLUME) Aureal One, the blockchain network is all that the young generation of today dreams about and it is only accessible to them in gaming and an alternate reality system. Aureal One is highly versed in trading with its flash transactions and low costs that make it possible for dealers to come up with a wide variety of new experiences. The way Aureal One is assisted with the project has been through the introduction of the selected in a form of a 21-rounds presale which is planned to have its budgeting round of $50 million. It is staking through Dlume. Users who are DLUME token holders can receive rewards and vote, consequently, involving the community. Following the rise of games like Clash of Tiles on these platforms offers them the right opportunity. Through this kind of exposure, the platforms get extra chances to promote their capabilities, and as a result, they become recognized in the gaming industry. 3. Polygon ($MATIC) The core reason for subtracting part of Polygon’s shift towards the reinforcement of Ethereum scalability is the fact that the vast majority of the audience from the most different parts of the globe are already set on it. The Ethereum-based apps in the world are scaling up, and as a result, the demand for quick and low-cost transactions is also rising so that MATIC will be the best option for this. Polygon has been defending its right through the unique ecosystem, which in its turn is the first issue that has to be held in mind with the new MATIC most-bed coins in 2024, Dark horse or all the others, you name it. 4. Avalanche ($AVAX) Every once in a while, fifteenth- theses Ballsom Arkorum is getting deep thoughts about the committee, however, he continues to crack jokes with its members…BSC referred to as sound-breaking-hour saver is expected to be Atherium-hardforks-ed. The next release will be a considerable step for the project. 5. Chainlink ($LINK) Chainlink acts as a bridge between the real world and blockchain system oracles, thus being analogical with decentralized oracles. The close relationship between the two, as they are the occurrence of smart contracts, which need to rely on real-world data for trust and accuracy feeds, is the fact for which smart contracts are driving. Their focus on these close data sources increases the number of reliable data feed providers thus making several of these more needing. Chainlink’s gradual enlargement of the number of links to other blockchains is really the main target, which does not preclude it from being a very tempting option for investors who demand medium and long-time investment plans. Final Conclusion: To sum up, the cryptocurrency space is an innovation hub and the probable growth that will result in due course is also a benefit, additionally, the new usage of these virtual coins in the market can also be seen. DexBoss ($DEBO) This invention has undoubtedly contributed to the wealth of most crypto players, notably those who supported it during the investor-oriented presale. Our essential goal is to break the traditional market structure by creating a platform that can be traded but do not have just primary features, in other words, where it also provides users with different functions such as liquidity farming and margin trading, thus, the platform is also easy to access for beginners. Further, while attaining such an understanding of the projects and deciding the future properly, the shareholders can advise soundly, which will pave the way to achieving the longed-for objectives and the taking of risks. Also, Aureal One ($DLUME) becomes one of the major coins that are being added to the list by applications known to the public or rather it is building the applications that shall be the prime ones for gaming and the metaverse, those enabling scalability to Ethereum, and real data feeds for blockchain systems. For most of the time, the evaluations of the most progressive cryptos should be on a rise due to their growth and evolution. The potential cryptocurrency investor in this way will be able to “move along with the tide” of the market and will be thus able to catch the various chances occurring at a time of the rise in the level of high-potential projects given that the investor uses accurate research and has a deep understanding of the current market trends.",Sponsored,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|MATIC|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-28 07:05:20

That serves as a test of the strength of the former resistance-turned-support, following which bigger rallies unfold. The ""breakout and retest play"" phenomenon is well-known across asset classes. Bitcoin's (BTC) ongoing sell-off might be just that – a healthy retest of the breakout point or the former resistance-turned-support of $73,757 breached in November. In other words, the downward momentum could run out of steam at or closer to these levels, potentially setting the stage for a bigger run higher. BTC has dropped over 15% to under $80,000 this month, exposing the former resistance-turned-support at $73,757. Prices broke above that level in early November, ending months-long consolidation after pro-crypto Donald Trump won the U.S. Presidential election. The tendency of markets to retrace or revisit the breakout point before staging more enormous rallies has its roots in the behavioral aspects of investing. People are generally risk averse when it comes to securing gains. So, when facing profits, traders quickly book those instead of allowing the winning trade to run wild. The so-called prospect theory explains why post-breakout rallies abruptly run out of steam, often leading to a retest of the breakout point. BTC holders have been taking profits around the $100K mark since December. Now, as prices turn lower and near the breakout point, in this case, $73,757, market participants who missed the initial rally jump in, ensuring the level holds. The resulting bounce from the former resistance-turned-support draws in more and more buyers, potentially yielding a bigger rally. That's precisely what happened in the third quarter of 2023 and August-September 2020. On both occasions, the breakout and retest produced bigger rallies to new record highs. Traders, however, need to note that a failed retest or a lack of a meaningful bounce indicates underlying weakness that can evolve into a full blown downtrend. Over the years, I have seen numerous examples of retests of breakouts/breakdowns leading to bigger moves in traditional markets. Consider the yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond. It triggered a double-bottom breakout in January 2024 and revisited the breakout level multiple times before rising to multi-year highs. The AUD/USD pair dived out of a major support trendline in December, hinting at a deeper slide. The pair bounced to the trendline resistance early this month only to see sharp losses this week.",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-28 07:09:51

If bulls cannot initiate a surge, Ethereum Classic price may drop below the immediate support line at $17.01, resulting in a correction to $15.2. Is Ethereum Classic A Good Investment? Ethereum Classic has long been a more affordable alternative to ETH. With Ether transitioning to a Proof-of-Stake model, those favoring Proof-of-Work networks could shift their interest to Ethereum Classic. Despite an increase in value in 2023, Ethereum Classic did not meet market expectations, signaling potential concerns. However, Ethereum Classic is not viewed as an unregistered security, which is positive for its market standing. As a result, ETC is a good investment option in the long term. Why is the ETC Price Down Today? Following the overall selling pressure in the market, ETC price is dropping toward $18. Will ETC Recover? If buyers defend the immediate support at $17, we might see a strong recovery toward $20. Will ETC Price Reach $100? ETC price might soon reach the $100 mark in 2028 if the buying demand continues to surge and Ethereum Classic attracts altcoin investors. Will ETC Price Reach $1000? Due to the effort of the Ethereum community, Ethereum Classic Coin’s prices will continue to increase. However, there is currently no indication that the Ethereum Classic (ETC) Coin will reach $1000 in the near future, which is a long-term target. Is ETC a Good Long-Term Investment? ETC has gained popularity thanks to strong community support. However, it’s crucial to conduct thorough research into their long-term potential to determine if it represents a viable long-term investment. Recent ETC News/Opinions Buterin recommended that individuals dissatisfied with Ethereum’s transition to Proof of Stake could use Ethereum Classic, which continues to utilize the Proof of Work consensus system. ETC Price Prediction March 2025 Over the last few days, ETC coin price has been on a downward trend and it aims to drop below crucial Fib levels. If the BTC price aims for a recovery above $90K in March, we might see a solid recovery in the ETC price. According to technical analysis, we might see the ETC price to record the maximum level of $25 and minimum price of $15, with an expected average trading price of $19 throughout March. Ethereum Classic Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Ethereum Classic Price Prediction March 2025 $15 $19 $25 Ethereum Classic Price Forecast 2025 Historically, Ethereum Classic has mirrored Ethereum’s price movements closely, occasionally even reaching new ATHs before Ethereum. As Ethereum has solidified its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency and emerged as the leading proof-of-stake coin and a deflationary asset over the past year, it is poised to achieve new ATHs in the upcoming bull cycle.

In a recent Binance Square vote, 86% of users supported listing Pi Coin on the exchange. This has excited Pi Network fans, who think a Binance listing could make the coin more trusted and push its price higher. 86% of Voters Support Pi Coin Listing On February 17, Binance launched a community survey to see if users wanted Pi Coin to be listed. The response was huge, with 86% of nearly 295,000 participants voting in favor. This strong support shows the growing interest in Pi Coin. Inspite of favorable voting results, Binance made it clear that the vote alone doesn’t guarantee a listing. However, Binance said the final choice to launch Pi Coin will go through a strict review. They further posted on Binance Square that, “We respect the vote results, but they are just for guidance. The decision depends on our official checks and standards.” Despite this, the high level of support has caught the crypto community’s attention. Pi Network’s Growing Popularity Since past few month Pi Network has gained significant popularity, largely due to its solution to Bitcoin’s major mining problem. It now has over 60 million active users and a strong social media presence, with 3.7 million followers on X making the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by following. Many believe that if Pi Coin gets listed on Binance, it will gain more exposure and attract more investors. How a Binance Listing Could Impact Pi Coin’s Price The excitement around a potential Binance listing comes at a time when Pi Coin’s price has dropped. As of now Pi coin has been trading around $2.4 reflecting a drop of 11% due to market crash. However, history has shown that when a cryptocurrency gets listed on Binance, it often experiences strong price movements. If Pi Coin is officially listed, it could gain more trust and see a rise in value. Pi Day Celebration On 14 March Meanwhile, Pi Network supporters are looking forward to Pi Day on March 14. This annual event celebrates the project’s launch, which happened on the same date in 2019. Many believe this year’s Pi Day could bring more updates about the coin’s future.",News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BNB|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-28 07:11:42

PEPE/USD chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, Pepe’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.00000724, beginning a bearish trend to $0.00000605. Is PEPE A Good Investment? Reviewing the Pepe project’s roadmap, it appears there are no detailed plans other than anticipation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate. Given this lack of clear direction and with an already sizable community of over 500,000 Twitter followers, the project’s price growth potential may be capped. However, meme coins have a reputation for offering significant returns, as their values can surge dramatically when supported by strong community movements. This was evident when Pepe’s value skyrocketed by over 222% to reach a new all-time high (ATH) following its listing on the Binance exchange. A similar significant announcement in 2025 could propel Pepe to surpass its previous ATH. Why is Pepe down today? Pepe’s price has declined over the last few hours as it faced intense selling pressure. The price is aiming for a hold below the $0.0000075 mark. Will Pepe price recover? If buyers strongly defend the $0.000007 mark, we might see a strong recovery above $0.00001. Will Pepe price reach $0.01? Pepe’s price might touch the $0.01 mark by the end of 2029. However, this price milestone entirely depends on the utility of Pepe coin and future buying demand. Will Pepe price reach $1? Pepe has a great community, and the hype is high for the meme coin. If everything remains good, we might see Pepe’s price touch $1 soon or by 2040. Recent news Tech billionaire Elon Musk stirred online buzz by renaming his X (formerly Twitter) profile to ‘Kekius Maximus’ and changing his profile picture to the ‘Pepe the Frog’ meme. PEPE Price Prediction February 2025 If BTC price records robust surges this month, we might see PEPE price skyrocketing. We expect the PEPE price to record minimum and maximum prices of $0.000009 and $0.000018, respectively. The average price might be around $0.000015. Month Potential low ($) Potential average ($) Potential high ($) February 2025 0.000009 0.000015 0.000018 Pepe price prediction 2025 The Pepe roadmap is somewhat vague, with few definitive plans beyond the expectation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate the market. This lack of clear direction might cap the project’s price potential, despite its robust community. Meme coins have a reputation for offering significant financial returns, as their values can surge rapidly when supported by their communities. The impact of major announcements was evident when Pepe’s value soared by more than 222% following its listing on the Binance exchange, reaching an all-time high. A similar event in 2025 could potentially send Pepe to new peaks. In 2025, Pepe’s minimum expected price is projected to be $0.000024.

For instance, Shiba Inu is developing Shibarium, a layer-two scaling solution on Ethereum , alongside various protocols and tools for its community. Meanwhile, Dogecoin is enhancing tools and libraries that facilitate the integration of $DOGE as a payment option for businesses.

Jake Claver, a prominent business leader and financial strategist, recently highlighted this development as a crucial step toward enhancing the flexibility and functionality of the XRPL. This advancement enables permissionless development while maintaining compliance, scalability, and security—key factors for institutional adoption. Unlike other blockchain networks that prioritized programmability from inception, XRPL has taken a structured approach by first optimizing specific use cases. This new feature set will build on the existing framework, allowing developers to create custom solutions for institutions without compromising efficiency. Major #XRP Ledger update – Native Programmability. This marks a huge step forward for flexible, permissionless development. It's significant for institutions to create custom solutions that are both compliant and scalable, without compromising on security or efficiency. 1/21 — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) February 25, 2025 The Evolution of XRPL’s Programmability Historically, XRPL has provided a robust financial infrastructure with built-in tools such as decentralized exchange (DEX) , escrow mechanisms, and tokenization features. These elements are vital for the integration of blockchain technology into traditional finance. However, until now, XRPL has not offered a native way for developers to introduce custom logic directly within its existing features. With the introduction of “Smart Features,” XRPL is evolving beyond its modular design to incorporate programmability in a way that enhances, rather than replaces, its existing framework. This means that core functionalities—such as escrows, automated market makers (AMMs), and tokens—can be customized to meet specific regulatory and operational needs. Developers will extend these features rather than create new ones from scratch, leveraging pre-audited code to enhance security and efficiency. Smart Escrows: The First Step One of the most anticipated enhancements is the introduction of Smart Escrows. Currently, XRPL’s escrow feature allows funds to be released only based on time constraints or password conditions. With Smart Escrows, developers can introduce more complex logic, enabling use cases such as Notary-based escrows, where funds can only be unlocked by specific accounts. Credential-based escrows, require the recipient to hold a specific non-fungible token (NFT) for access. Cascading escrows facilitate structured financial transactions real estate deals or options trading. The implementation of Smart Escrows will follow a phased rollout, beginning with an early development network (devnet) in Q1, progressing to a fully functional devnet in Q2, and moving toward an amendment voting process in Q3. By Q4, XRPL is expected to introduce a smart contract devnet, which will further expand its programmability. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Future of Smart Features and Smart Contracts Beyond Smart Escrows, the XRPL roadmap includes the expansion of programmability across various native features. Smart AMMs will allow for custom trading strategies, Smart Accounts will introduce additional security protections, and Smart Tokens will enable regulatory compliance for tokenized assets . Smart Batch transactions will incorporate logic trees, facilitating complex financial operations with streamlined execution. Importantly, XRPL’s Smart Features will complement traditional smart contracts rather than replace them. Developers will have the flexibility to leverage native building blocks when possible, while still having access to a full smart contract environment for more complex needs. These smart contracts, which will integrate Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-style logic with XRPL’s transaction model, will enable advanced decentralized finance (DeFi) applications such as derivatives, perpetual contracts, and staking rewards. Institutional Implications and Adoption The introduction of native programmability is a strategic move to attract institutional interest. Financial institutions require tailored blockchain solutions that balance efficiency, security, and compliance. XRPL’s approach—offering modular, customizable features—provides a compelling value proposition for businesses looking to integrate blockchain without the risks associated with untested smart contract environments. Additionally, while the XRPL EVM sidechain remains relevant for Ethereum developers, the ability to build directly on the core XRPL network offers greater security and efficiency. This advancement positions XRPL as a viable platform for institutional-grade blockchain applications, strengthening its role in the broader financial ecosystem. As the phased rollout progresses throughout 2025, the impact of these changes is expected to drive increased development activity and broader institutional engagement in the XRPL ecosystem.

Ethereum (ETH) The market turned bearish and Ethereum has lost its support at $2,400, falling by 21% in the past seven days. This market-wide drop impacted almost all cryptocurrencies with most in double digit losses in the past week. In the case of ETH, it is critical that the price remains above $2,000 as a key psychological level. If lost, then Ethereum will have good support around $1,800, a level not seen since 2023 when crypto was in a bear market. Looking ahead, Ethereum is quickly approaching a moment where its bullish uptrend is invalidated. A price under $2,000 would push it in a bear market with lower levels likely after that. Chart by Tradingview Ripple ( XRP ) XRP did its best to remain bullish, but the overall market pushed its price back to $2 at the time of this post. While this support level appears strong, continued selling would eventually break it and that could quickly see the price fall much lower. This cryptocurrency also had a difficult week, closing it with a 23% loss. If nothing changes in the coming days, then the next key support level is found at $1.6. Looking ahead, if the price falls under $2, then the rally is over, and the top was likely already made at $3.4 back in January 2025. While it is still early to call it, the signs remain bearish based on this price action. Chart by Tradingview Cardano (ADA) ADA lost its key support at $0.64 and closes the week with a 25% price drop. This is extremely concerning since the price could fall to $0.45 next. Such a price would return ADA to bear market levels. Sellers are dominating, and if buyers don’t return soon to bring ADA back above $0.64, then lower price levels should be expected as the downtrend continues. Looking ahead, ADA does not have the power to stop sellers at this time. Watch the key support at $0.45 since that level could bring back buyers if they don’t show up earlier. Chart by Tradingview Binance Coin (BNB) Binance Coin tried to stay above $600, but buyers were unable to defend that level after a massive sell pressure in the past 24h. With this support lost, the asset fell by 12% in the past week. If BNB continues to go lower, buyers could reappear between $550 and $500. Strong support at $500 has held well in the past when sellers spiked the price. Looking ahead, this cryptocurrency shows more strength than most altcoins, considering it has not made a lower low yet. The price consolidates into a flat range above $500, and as long as that level holds, BNB can recover later. Chart by Tradingview Solana (SOL) Solana had one of its worst weeks since 2024. The price appears in a free fall and registered a 27% loss in the past seven days. With the support at $134 gone, SOL may soon approach $100 at this rate. It is critical to maintain a three-digit price since this is a psychological level. At the same time, any price closing on $100 is likely to attract new buyers since that level is also a key support. Looking ahead, Solana must do its best to not drop under $100 as that would put an end to its uptrend. The next few days and weeks are decisive.

This week’s expiry event is larger than usual because it is the end of the month. However, the impact on spot markets is likely to be minimal as they’re already reeling from US President Trump’s trade war. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s big batch of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 0.71, meaning that there are slightly more call (long) contracts expiring than puts (shorts). Moreover, open interest (OI), or the value or number of BTC options contracts yet to expire, still remains highest at the $120,000 strike price, which is $1.5 billion, according to Deribit. There is also around $1 billion in OI at the $100,000 and $110,000 strike prices. Bearish sentiment is also seeping back as $800,000 in OI currently sits at the $80,000 strike price, which is where the asset stands now. Crypto derivatives provider Greeks Live said the team was “predominantly bearish,” with traders watching $82,000 as a “critical support level that must hold to maintain the high timeframe trend.” However, that line has been broken to the downside as of press time. “There’s significant concern about continued downside, with many members discussing the rapid 17% decline over three days and debating whether recent selling is controlled or indicative of a broader market shift.” Bitcoin OI by expiry. Source: Deribit Technical analysis suggests if the price closes below the 2024 volume weighted average price (VWAP) bands, “the higher timeframe trend would be ‘cooked’ and could lead to $77,000 to $72,000 levels,” warned Greeks. Around 526,000 Ethereum contracts are also expiring today, with a notional value of $1.14 billion and a put/call ratio of 0.52. This brings Friday’s combined crypto options expiry notional value to around $5.8 billion. Crypto Markets Tank This week’s market rout has continued into Friday, with total capitalization dumping a further 6% on the day to $2.76 trillion. It has now fallen through longer-term support and could return to October levels. Bitcoin dumped 5% in a fall to $80,200 during Asian trading on Friday morning. The asset has now lost 18% in a week, and its correction has deepened to 25% from all-time highs. The last time BTC was below $80,000 was on Nov. 10. Meanwhile, Ethereum has dumped 8% to its lowest level for more than a year, hitting $2,150 on Friday morning as its weekly losses amount to a whopping 22%. The altcoins were a sea of red with them all bleeding out by similar amounts at the time of writing.

The decline comes despite US regulators declaring that meme coins are collectibles and not subject to securities laws. However, despite the regulatory clarity, the crypto market is facing one of its worst selloffs in history. Can DOGE price recover or is there a risk of further downside to $0.10? DOGE trades at $0.185 at press time, with a staggering 10% drop in 24 hours. Dogecoin Price Hits 4-Month Low as SEC Deems Meme Coins Non-Securities Dogecoin price trades at its lowest level in nearly four months after the price dropped by 26% in just seven days. The downtrend continues to extend despite the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) declaring that meme coins are not securities . According to the SEC, meme coin trading does involve the offer and sale of securities as outlined in the federal securities laws. However, meme coin purchasers are not protected under securities laws. This statement has increased the odds of a Dogecoin ETF approval. According to Polymarket, the odds of a DOGE ETF being approved by the end of July 31 have soared to record highs. An approval could spark DOGE price rally to $1. Dogecoin ETF Approval Nonetheless, these factors are not enough for a bullish Dogecoin price prediction . Instead, DOGE holders continue to suffer losses. DOGE Holders Face Massive Losses as MVRV Dips The decline in Dogecoin price has placed many DOGE holders in losses, as shown by the 30-day Market value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. This ratio is deeply negative, suggesting that Dogecoin traders are facing unrealized losses of 20%. A significant dip in the MVRV ratio often hints at a buying opportunity that may precede a Dogecoin price rebound. However, if these losses continue, it may dampen the market sentiment for the meme coin in the near term, leading to further losses. Dogecoin 30-Day MVRV Ratio Unless more traders buy the dip and show confidence in a recovery, and buyers overpower panic sellers, DOGE price still faces headwinds. Can Dogecoin Price Drop to $0.10? Dogecoin price is facing the risk of further downside that could push the meme coin to $0.10. On the daily chart, the RSI has dropped to record lows of 23, indicating a brutal sell-off that is causing the bearish trend. The last time that the DOGE RSI was this oversold was in March 2023 when Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Banks collapsed causing panic in the crypto market. Despite this oversold RSI, the crypto market is still in a state of fear, diminishing the likelihood of a DOGE price recovery. As selling pressure grows, Dogecoin price will likely drop to $0.12 in the near term. If it loses this support level, Dogecoin could plunge to $0.0085. DOGE/USDT: 1-day Chart Is a Recovery Ahead? Dogecoin price remains under bearish stress, which weakens any chances of a recovery in the near term. The widespread market crash has intensified panic selling, which will accelerate the price decline for altcoins like DOGE. Therefore, a recovery for DOGE price is not likely to happen in the near term unless the sentiment in the broader market shifts to positive and buying pressure replaces selling activity.

On Feb. 27, the commission’s Division of Corporation Finance addressed a long-standing debate over whether cryptocurrencies—particularly memecoins—fall under federal securities laws. The current SEC views memecoins as more like collectibles than investments and claims they don’t meet the definition of a security under the Howey test . “Memecoins typically are purchased for entertainment, social interaction, and cultural purposes, and their value is driven primarily by market demand and speculation. In this regard, memecoins are akin to collectibles,” SEC officials wrote in a recent staff statement. According to the commission, meme coins aren’t part of a larger enterprise. There’s no central team pooling funds to develop a business, and buyers aren’t investing in a structured project expecting long-term growth. It added that memecoins derive their price movements from “market demand and speculation” rather than the “entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.” Since their value is tied to hype and collective sentiment—much like collectibles—the agency said they fail to meet the Howey test’s criteria for an investment contract. “Persons who participate in the offer and sale of meme coins do not need to register their transactions with the Commission,” the SEC said, but added that fraudulent activity wouldn’t go unnoticed. You might also like: SEC and MetaMask creator Consensys agree to end lawsuit The agency warned that scams involving memecoins could still face enforcement from other federal or state regulators. While the tokens themselves may not be securities, misleading investors or engaging in deceptive practices could still land projects in legal trouble. It also stressed that the statement only applies to meme coins that fit its description, and tokens disguised as memecoins to sidestep securities laws could also be subject to regulation, depending on their structure and purpose. However, the agency noted that its views aren’t a “rule, regulation, guidance, or statement” of the SEC itself. Instead, it described the statement as a staff interpretation with “no legal force or effect.” The commission aims to provide “greater clarity on the application of the federal securities laws to crypto assets” with its statement but made it clear that the classification of meme coins could still depend on “the economic realities of the particular transaction.” Currently spearheaded by a pro-crypto leadership , the SEC’s statement marks a significant shift from the regulator’s previous stance under former chair Gary Gensler, who mostly viewed all cryptocurrencies, except Bitcoin , as securities. During Gensler’s tenure, the SEC pursued legal actions against major crypto entities, including Coinbase and Ripple Labs. Notably, the lawsuit against Ripple Labs, initiated in 2020, became a benchmark case in this regard. A 2023 ruling found that XRP’s programmatic sales didn’t violate securities laws , but the SEC appealed the decision.

Of course, Saylor has been joking in a light mood as Bitcoin price crashes under $80,000 earlier today, while requesting investors to hold with diamond hands. On the other hand, Saylor has been actively in discussions with lawmakers for implementing a BTC strategic reserve for the United States. Michael Saylor Wants Bitcoin Investors to Hold With Diamond Hands The Bitcoin price crash under $80,000 today has sent tremors across the larger crypto market. With this, BTC has extended its weekly losses to more than 18% as the crypto market grapples through major liquidity crisis, macro uncertainty, Donald Trump’s trade war tariffs and much more. Responding to the current developments, Michael Saylor wrote: “Sell a kidney if you must, but keep the Bitcoin”. The strategy executive chairman has been an ardent supporter of BTC and has pledged to never sell his Bitcoins anytime in the future. Several corporate players like Metaplanet , Semler Scientific, etc. have adopted Saylor’s Bitcoin playbook thereby managing to build immense wealth for their shareholders. Saylor’s comment of selling a kidney saw mixed reactions from the Bitcoin community. While some took this as a joke, others took a jibe at him for his forever Bitcoin bulls predictions. One of the followers named Geoffrey said: “maybe you should have thought of that when you were buying 97k and not saving your powder for a dip”. A further 16% drop in Bitcoin’s price could push MicroStrategy into a total loss on its Bitcoin holdings, in addition to its $8 billion debt burden. Critics argue that Saylor’s decision to heavily invest at market highs may have been overly aggressive. Recent reports also suggested that Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings would be at risk if the MSTR stock falls even further. Saylor Discusses Bitcoin Strategic Reserve for US Earlier this week, on Tuesday, Michael Saylor met with the House Financial Services Committee and Representative French Hill to discuss building Bitcoin Strategic reserves for the United States. Saylor emphasized the importance of positioning the U.S. as a global leader incryptocurrency innovation. The meeting focused on fostering a regulatory environment that supports the growth and adoption of blockchain technologies while ensuring financial stability. Congressman Dan Meuser hosted the meeting with Saylor noting: “Digital assets can unlock a frictionless payment future and enable new sources of access to capital. I look forward to the work the Financial Services Committee will do in crafting a commonsense legislative framework to provide clear rules of the road, fulfilling President Trump’s promise to make the U.S. the crypto capital of the world.” Pitching BTC to Jeff Bezos Earlier this week, Michael Saylor also pitched Bitcoin to billionaire Jeff Bezos. Bezos, who owns the Washington Post, said that the publication will undergo major changes for its opinions section while promoting “free markets” and “personal liberties”. Responding to this, Saylor wrote: “Bitcoin is the best way to promote personal liberties and free markets. It offers an open protocol for prosperity that can be delivered to everyone via digital technology”. Bitcoin price has faced a sharp correction in recent market turmoil and is down another 6% today trading at $80,290 as of press time.

Japan ( NKY:IND ) fell 2.90% to around 37,300 on Friday, hitting its lowest levels in five months. The Japanese yen strengthened to around 149.4 per dollar on Friday and was on track to gain nearly 4% for February after the latest economic reports pointed to softening activity, including retail sales, industrial production and Tokyo inflation figures. Japan retail sales rise the most in 11 months; industrial output falls for 3rd month Data released on Friday showed that Tokyo’s core inflation, a leading indicator of nationwide price trends, slowed to 2.2% in February from 2.5% in January. Japan's housing starts declined by 4.6% year-over-year in January 2024, worsening from a 2.5% drop in the previous month and surpassing market forecasts of a 2.6% fall. China ( SHCOMP ) fell 1.94% to below 3,370 while the Shenzhen Component dropped 1% to 10,820 on Friday, with both benchmarks set to end the week lower. The offshore yuan decline around 7.29 per dollar, triggered by US President Donald Trump's announcement of an additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports. Meanwhile, investors eagerly await fiscal stimulus measures from China’s ""Two Sessions"" next week. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 3.52% to 23,415 on the last trading day of February, marking a second session of losses. India ( SENSEX ) fell 1.43% to 73,696 in morning trade on Friday, after being flat the prior day, hitting its lowest level since early June 2024. Traders were cautious ahead of the release of GDP data later today, with the market expecting the GDP to grow at 6.3%, still lower than the RBI's estimate of 6.8%. Australia ( AS51 ) fell 1.16% to close at 8,172 on Friday, reaching its lowest point in nearly two months. The Australian dollar depreciated past $0.623 on Friday and was on track to decline over 2% for the week. Domestically, data revealed that private credit growth in Australia fell short of expectations in January, with both household and business credit showing signs of slowdown. In the U.S., on Thursday, all three major indexes ended in red dragged down by a selloff in tech stocks, as investors weighed Nvidia’s earnings, trade policy uncertainty, and economic data. U.S. stock futures stabilized on Friday as investors braced for the upcoming Personal Consumption Expenditures price index report, the Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge of inflation: Dow -0.02%; S&P 500 +0.10%; Nasdaq +0.05%.

The filing, submitted on February 25 to the Delaware Division of Corporations, signals the company’s intention to introduce a spot ETF centered on the layer-1 cryptocurrency Aptos. While this move does not guarantee immediate approval, it is an important part of the regulatory process. A Blockchain Researcher wrote on X, “According to official documents, the BITWISE APTOS ETF has been registered in Delaware, USA! Earlier, several APTOS ETPs were launched in Europe, including Bitwise Aptos Staking ETP and 21Shares Aptos Staking ETP.” The next crucial phase involves submitting a formal application to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This application will include a comprehensive prospectus detailing the ETF’s structure, investment strategy, and how it plans to track the performance of the Aptos blockchain. This filing comes at a time when regulatory sentiment toward cryptocurrency is shifting, especially under new leadership. The news of the filing has had an impressive effect on the price of Aptos (APT), which surged by 12% following the announcement. APT hit a high of $6.31 in the last 24 hours before hitting a reverse. The token, along with Bitcoin and other coins, is currently experiencing a bearish dip. Bitwise has already made waves in the crypto ETF market, having filed for several crypto-related ETFs in the past, including a push for the XRP ETF. If successful, the Aptos ETF could pave the way for further altcoin ETFs, offering investors new ways to diversify their portfolios with digital assets.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,APT|TRADING|ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-28 07:27:48

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially stated that meme coins are not securities, excluding them from federal securities regulations. This decision, announced by the SEC ’s Division of Corporation Finance, clarifies that digital asset transactions won’t require registration under federal securities laws. The SEC’s statement explained that meme coins, which are bought for entertainment, social interaction, and cultural reasons, lack real use or functionality. The SEC said that meme coins do not involve any real-world function or business backing, so they do not meet the definition of securities under federal law.

The attackers used a malicious meeting app “that installs information-stealing malware to steal cryptocurrency wallets.” The attack was initially flagged by several impacted users on Telegram , helping affected users to navigate through the loss. The malware is designed to infect both Mac and Windows devices. GrassCall’s Social Engineering Tactics Choy Kwok, a web3 professional, posted on X early this week, warning followers about the scam. He cautioned users not to download any meeting app that was asked by recruiters pretending to be from Chain Seeker. Another Monday, another scam This time it is @ChainSeeker_io Setting up time to speak with them will take you to @GrassCall Do not download anything! https://t.co/Tl8CtkKzA5 pic.twitter.com/4nDXRvDRjk — Choy (@choykwok) February 24, 2025 Crypto Jobs List, a web3 job portal, carried several job listings for a blockchain-based platform ‘ChainSeeker.io’. However, little did the applicants know that perpetrators were behind the job scam. The jobs were also listed on LinkedIn and X, from legitimate-looking fake profiles. “Setting up time to speak with them will take you to GrassCall. Do not download anything,” Kwok wrote. Aspirants who applied for jobs via the portal, were reportedly asked to reach out to the company’s Chief Marketing Officer via Telegram to coordinate the meeting. Source: Choy, via Bleeping Computer They were then asked to download a video meeting software GrassCall, with a website link and call code. The website “grasscall[.]net” led to a download link that described GrassCall as a “revolutionary AI solution in the field of communications.” Source: Bleeping Computer Atomic Stealer Malware Drains Cryptos From Victim Wallets According to a cybersecurity researcher g0njxa, GrassCall website is a clone of a “Gatherum” website , which was used by the same Russian group in previous campaigns. The GrassCall app prompts to enter a code shared by the fake CMO, and installs remote access trojans (RATs). The RAT then installs the Atomic (AMOS) Stealer malware on Macs. “The rat is used to create persistence in the machine, add a keylogger for password too and deploying seed phishing for the hard wallets,” G0njxa told Bleeping Computer. Once the malware takes control of the computer, it attempts to steal files based on keywords, cryptocurrency wallets, and passwords. If a crypto wallet is found with the extracted password, the assets in the wallet are drained, he explained. This comes parallelly with the recent widespread malware campaign targeting users on GitHub , flagged by cybersecurity firm Kaspersky.

With the market trend shifting, investors and crypto enthusiasts are looking for the next crypto to hit $1 that offers exponential gains in the upcoming bull run. Aureal One, DexBoss, and the other three coins are competing to lead their spot in the marketplace. Let’s explore their unique attributes in detail. Best 5 Cryptocurrencies to Buy Now AurealOne DexBoss Bitcoin Ethereum Binance Coin We all know that modern cryptocurrency trading has given tomorrow’s opportunities to the smartest people. The right news of this time is the issue of cryptocurrency skyrocket also Aureal One (DLUME) Enter the realm of the future through Aureal One, a state-of-the-art blockchain platform that magnifies the potential of game and metaverse activities. By including features like blazingly fast transactions and employing minimal transaction costs, Aureal One makes the development process simpler for both developers and the users, respectively. Besides, the DLUME token, which is based on Ethereum, is considered a more familiar and convenient platform for transactions in the ecosystem. Click here to know more about Aureal One Personally, I like it that the company has its own virtual world called DarkLume, where all these cutting-edge technologies can be implemented. The later part of the sentence means; by creating a platform where global developers are interconnected, we provide you with true digital ownership. The decentralized world of DarkLume, where people can buy, sell, and create projects, belongs to them. They can earn money from the modifications and build their kingdom of city beauty together. By now, it is reported by the developers that they have successfully reached 72% of the target amount which equals to $3.2 million. The tokens are sold for $0.0013 during the presale. After it is listed at $0.005, the price is expected to increase. Those who are interested in the tokens at the presale can do the staking through a decentralized wallet, depositing cryptos such as ETH, BNB, and then connecting it to the Aureal One presale webpage. 2. DexBoss (DEBO) A new decentralized cryptocurrency exchange platform DexBoss wants to alter the ecosystem of DeFi with the implementation of an increased leverage trading and low fees. With the support of more than 2000 cryptos, DexBoss is the source of liquidity and the medium of exchange, which was globally acceptable by people at any level. Powered by an advanced idea of the trading terminal, the AI-driven charts and executing orders will allow traders to conduct all possible trading activities in the fastest and the most effective manner. DexBoss is dedicated to the notions of community participation, empowerment, and governance. Token holders are given a chance to be part of the decision-making process and indirectly request the platform’s leadership team either to develop or to direct the project further. It is through this democratic capacity that there is a feeling of being the indirect cause of the policy hence, the users are persuaded to use the platform in tandem with the growth of the community. The presale of DexBoss reached its 79% milestone, with $588,000 out of the planned $750,000 being raised. The current price of presale is $0.011, and the price listed is $0.0505, the growth of this could lead to potential appreciation. The potential DEBO investors are not only able to purchase directly from the DEBO project via supported cryptocurrencies such as ETH, BNB, ARB but they can also use their credit card for the payment. The possible payment methods on the platform include: Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Solana, Tron, and Arbitrum networks. 3. Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin still leaves all its competitors significantly behind being in the first place in the market. As of February 27, 2025, Bitcoin is trading at $86,278 which is 1.74% lower than the previous close. The decrease is a consequence of the disorganization of the government, to come forward, in supporting the regulatory issues around the crypto sphere. Nevertheless, the industry insiders such as Cathie Wood, ARK Investment Management’s CEO, believe that the main driver of Bitcoin’s institutional adoption is still to come, hence more major money may be attracted to the stimulus of digital currency. 4. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is distinguished owing to its smart contract automation and a broad decentralized applications ecosystem. On February 27th, 2025, Ethereum’s price stands at $2,344.65, recording a drop of 3.51% from the previous session. Ethereum comes with a decentralized platform that has seen it attract developers and investors that love the selling point of its flexibility and at the same time, enjoy the ongoing updates with the aim of enhancing scalability and reducing the transaction cost. 5. Binance Coin (BNB) Binance Coin is a digital token that Binance exchange designed which is rated as the world’s largest crypto exchange based on its market. As per February 27, 2025, BNB is placed at $610.18, meaning it has declined by 1.26% since the previous close. The underlying strength and much more work that the popular crypto’s valuation comes from are its use within the Binance ecosystem such as the lower trading fees and opportunities to partake in token sales on the Binance Launchpad. The continuous widening of Binance’s pools of services and user database is the major contributors to BNB’s increase in that a high user base and demand are created which are the tokens’ growth factors. Final Thoughts The current state of the cryptocurrency market is still subject to great changes with both short-term and long-term investments being available there. Aureal One (DLUME) and DexBoss (DEBO) are the major assurance among their respective markets with their increasing pre-sale and growth possibilities. On the other hand, how existing players such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Binance Coin (BNB) keep being the leaders has made them victorious in gaining a lot of trader’s support, corporate’s investments, and the like as well as function.

While BTC fell by 7.7% in the last 24 hours to $79,000, Ethereum (ETH) fell to $2,100. With the declines, the Fear and Greed Index, which measures the sentiment among Bitcoin and cryptocurrency investors, fell to the level of extreme fear, and questions began to be asked among investors: “Is the bull run over? Has the bear run begun?” Related News: Extreme Fear Dominates Bitcoin and Altcoins! Should We Buy Fear? What Do Historical Data and Analysts Say? At this point, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, who stated in his previous posts that the bull market is not over and that it is too early to worry, updated his predictions after the last decline. CryptoQuant CEO X stated in his post that the BTC bull cycle will continue as long as it does not fall below $ 75,000, and that the critical level in the bull-bear cycle is $ 75,000. The famous CEO argued that the bullish expectation for Bitcoin continues and that a 30% decline is normal and healthy in bull cycles, and that the current bull cycle is not over. Ju said that if BTC drops significantly below $75,000, the bull cycle may be over. “I am a bull. The bull cycle is not over. 30% drops are normal in a bull cycle. If Bitcoin price drops significantly below $75k at this point, I would be wrong. I have not changed my stance; I have been consistent about the bull cycle and the 30% probability of a correction.” Ju lastly stated that he expects BTC to consolidate in a wide range such as $75,000 to $100,000 as in early 2024, and predicted that the rise will begin if positive news attracts new liquidity. Watch Out for the Weekend in Bitcoin! BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes warned investors that they are expecting a further decline in Bitcoin in the short term. Stating that BTC will experience a sharper decline this weekend, Hayes stated that the price will fall below $80,000. Arthur Hayes said that Bitcoin remains in a downtrend and is making lower lows. “We are making lower lows in this current wave of declines. I was risk-averse this morning, but looking at Bitcoin's price action, I think there will be another big wave below $80,000. That drop will most likely happen this weekend!” Hayes also predicted in his post a few days ago that BTC could fall to the $70,000 to $75,000 range if US President Donald Trump does not take positive steps. *This is not investment advice.

The high selling pressure has pushed the flagship cryptocurrency to oversold levels it had not seen since August 2024. Bitcoin Is Oversold, Time To Buy? According to an X post by seasoned crypto analyst Ali Martinez, BTC has entered oversold conditions it hadn’t seen since August 2024. Specifically, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for Bitcoin has dropped to the lowest level in the last seven months. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Showing Early Signs Of Bullish Divergence? Analyst Explains For the uninitiated, the RSI measures Bitcoin’s momentum on a scale of 0-100, with values above 70 signaling overbought conditions and below 30 indicating oversold levels. According to the following chart, BTC’s RSI has tumbled below 30, indicating the digital asset may be significantly oversold. Notably, the last time BTC was this oversold – in August 2024 – it led to a 33% price surge, pushing the digital asset from $49,000 to $64,000 in two weeks. A similar trajectory today could propel BTC to around $110,000. Acclaimed crypto investor The Wolf Of All Streets had similar thoughts on Bitcoin’s RSI. The investor shared the following 4-hour chart, saying: Bullish divergence with oversold RSI still very much in play. At the moment, RSI still is making a higher low. We need to see a clear “elbow up” on the next candle to confirm. Nothing here yet. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Rekt Capital predicts that there may be further downside for BTC. The analyst emphasized that BTC is getting closer to filling the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) gap between $78,000 to $80,700, which was created in November 2024. For the uninformed, a CME gap refers to the price difference between Bitcoin’s last traded price on the CME before the weekend and its price when the market reopens. Bitcoin is often believed to fill these gaps as part of a natural market correction, with the gap acting as a level of price support or resistance. Mixed Opinion On BTC Price Action The recent crypto market pullback has led to split opinions among analysts. For instance, a former Glassnode analyst recently said that the odds of being in a bear market are “not large.” Related Reading: Bitcoin 4-Year CAGR Drops To 14.45% But Still Outshines Gold, Stocks – Details Similarly, recent analysis by Andre Dragosch, European Head of Research at Bitwise, indicates that BTC may be undervalued at current market prices. On the contrary, Standard Chartered predicts that there may be another 10% drop in BTC price. Although the opinion on Bitcoin’s short-term price action may be divided, the long-term bullish case for the digital asset remains intact. At press time, BTC trades at $84,963, down 2.4% in the past 24 hours.

However, experts like Jeremy Hogan believe the Ripple vs SEC case’s complexity will lead to delays, predicting a conclusion no earlier than March 14. Notably, Hogan is maintaining his delay forecast for the XRP lawsuit, undeterred by the SEC’s recent decision to end the Tron lawsuit. Let’s unravel the lawyer’s predictions and analyze the Tron lawsuit’s potential implications on the Ripple case. When Will XRP Lawsuit End? Lawyer Answers Following the regulator’s move to pause the Tron lawsuit, the community is now wondering if the XRP lawsuit might be next in line for resolution. In response to the increasing speculations, legal expert Jeremy Hogan shared an X post . He reaffirmed his earlier prediction of a potential delay in the XRP lawsuit. “Ripple is STILL a more complicated a case to resolve because of the judgment,” stated Hogan, highlighting the higher possibility in the Ripple case’s delay. In addition, Hogan identified three key dates – March 14, April 11, and May 1 – as potential milestones for the settlement of the XRP lawsuit. According to Hogan, the Ripple vs SEC case may be settled on one of these three crucial dates. SEC’s Crypto Lawsuits and Ripple’s Future Significantly, the SEC has been making revolutionary moves over the past few days, concluding long-standing crypto lawsuits. Many high profile cases including Coinbase, Robinhood, OpenSea, and Uniswap have been closed by the restructured SEC under President Donald Trump. And most recently, the agency decided to pause the civil fraud case against Justin Sun, the founder of Tron Foundation. While many remain optimistic about the imminent XRP lawsuit settlement, lawyers like Hogan and MetaLawMan highlight the unlikely situation . According to them, Judge Analisa Torres’ ruling and the $125 million penalty remain significant obstacles to an earlier resolution. Not everyone is optimistic about the SEC’s recent actions. Former official John Reed Stark has leveled criticism against these moves. Stark believes that these regulatory reforms are a harbinger of the agency’s downfall, rather than a positive development. Three Likely Outcomes for Ripple vs SEC Case As pointed out by Protos, the Ripple vs SEC case has three most likely outcomes including affirmation, cross-appeals settlement, and reversal of Judge Torres’ decision. Statistically, affirming Judge Torres’ ruling is the most probable outcome of the XRP lawsuit. Aligning with the common practice of US appellate courts affirming lower court rulings, the Second Circuit will likely uphold Judge Torres’ decision. Next on the line is the lawsuit’s probable settlement. The SEC’s progressive approach and Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance reinforce the possibility of a settlement. With the SEC dismissing multiple crypto lawsuits, hopes for a Ripple case settlement are rising. The third most likely outcome of the SEC vs Ripple case is a reversal of Judge Torres’ decision. Interestingly, this would result in a decisive victory for the SEC. The judge ruled that programmatic sales of XRP aren’t securities and that Ripple’s exchange of XRP for non-cash services and labor was legitimate. If the appeals court reverses either of these decisions, it could lead to the XRP lawsuit’s ultimate outcome.

With Bitcoin options valued at $4.68 billion and Ethereum at $1.11 billion, traders are closely watching the put-to-call ratios and maximum pain points. For Bitcoin, the max pain point is far above its current market price, which may encourage options sellers to push prices higher as the expiration nears. Ethereum’s situation is similar, with its max pain point significantly higher than its market value, potentially leading to similar upward pressure. The approaching expiration is expected to bring heightened volatility, with many traders adopting defensive strategies such as call ratio spreads. This is due to the belief that Bitcoin could experience choppy price action and may retest lower levels before moving in any clear direction. The fear of continued downside is palpable, with market sentiment largely bearish, especially after a significant decline over the past few days. With institutional traders primarily focusing on monthly expiries, the potential for greater liquidity and tighter spreads suggests that this event could have a major impact on Bitcoin and Ethereum prices. In addition, with the expiration coming at the end of the month, it is expected that market makers will attempt to push the prices closer to the max pain levels, given the cluster of open interest. The market’s response to today’s expiry could offer valuable insights into how Bitcoin and Ethereum will behave in the short term, potentially setting the stage for a volatile period ahead. Overall, traders are preparing for heightened market movements as the expiration of these major options contracts could significantly influence the price direction of both Bitcoin and Ethereum , potentially pushing prices toward the max pain levels.",,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|ETH|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-28 08:03:05

Martinez tells his 128,800 followers on the social media platform X that a bearish divergence is evident on Bitcoin’s weekly time frame. A bearish divergence occurs when price is recording higher highs and higher lows while an indicator such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is recording lower lows and lower highs. The RSI indicator is a momentum oscillator used to determine oversold or overbought conditions. According to Martinez, Bitcoin had a similar divergence in November of 2021 prior to the bear market that followed and which saw BTC fall from the then-record high of around $69,000 to a cycle low of about $15,500 a year later.

Source: Ali Martinez/X The crypto trader further says that if the current Bitcoin cycle mirrors that of the first-halving cycle which ran from 2011 to 2015, it could be an indication that the crypto king topped out at $108,800 and is primed for further correction.

Consensys' CEO, Joseph Lubin, welcomed the decision and praised the SEC's new leadership, calling their approach “pro-innovation” and “pro-investor.” This marks the sixth case the SEC has dropped against crypto firms this week, signaling a shift in its enforcement strategy. Despite this, the SEC remains silent on its most high-profile case—its lawsuit against Ripple. Consensys, the company behind MetaMask, faced a lawsuit after the SEC raised concerns about whether its wallet violated securities laws. Lubin, however, expressed his satisfaction with the outcome, stating that Consensys and the SEC had reached an agreement in principle to dismiss the case. Once the Commission formally approves it, the case will be closed. This positive resolution highlights the SEC’s changing attitude toward crypto companies under its new leadership. Lubin also acknowledged that the SEC’s shift in focus was beneficial for both innovation and investor protection. While the SEC’s decision to drop its action against Consensys is welcomed by many in the industry, it raises questions about the future of the Ripple lawsuit , which has been ongoing for over three years. As one of the most significant enforcement actions under SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, the Ripple case has been a focal point of crypto regulation debates. Recently, the SEC tried to stall progress in the case, but there has been little public information since. This has left the crypto community speculating about whether the Commission will ultimately drop its case against Ripple. Recently, the SEC held a closed-door meeting that sparked further speculation about the fate of the Ripple case. According to the agenda, the meeting focused on resolving litigation claims, and discussions about examinations and enforcement proceedings were part of the talks. This has led some to believe that the SEC could be moving toward wrapping up its active investigations and lawsuits related to the crypto industry. The community remains eager to learn more , especially regarding Ripple, as the SEC has not provided concrete updates. Despite the uncertainty surrounding the Ripple case, some analysts believe that, given the recent trends, the SEC may continue to settle or drop actions against crypto firms. The SEC has already closed its investigations into several major players, including Gemini, and it’s becoming increasingly clear that the regulatory landscape is shifting. The XRP community remains hopeful that the Commission may soon decide to settle or dismiss its case against Ripple, but for now, there are no clear signs that this will happen soon. In the meantime, while the SEC and Consensys have reached a resolution, the focus of the crypto world remains on Ripple and its ongoing battle with the SEC. The industry is watching closely, hoping for a shift in the Commission’s stance. The growing trend of the SEC dropping lawsuits and shifting its focus suggests that the days of aggressive enforcement against crypto firms may be numbered. With the end of the month approaching, there may be more developments in the ongoing saga of crypto regulation. It seems that, for now, the question is not if the SEC will drop the Ripple case, but when .",,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-28 08:05:46

The fresh tariffs on China and probably the UK have created huge uncertainty not only among the market participants but also within the institutions. As a result, institutions like Blackrock have been liquidating billions worth of BTC & ETH ETF holdings, which has escalated the selling pressure over the token. Presently, the BTC price has whipped out the gains incurred in the past 6 months, flashing massive bearish signals for the start crypto. Short Liquidations Outperform Longs! Ever since the price has broken down from the consolidated range around $96,000, the traders appear to have become bearish on Bitcoin. As the price continues to plunge hard, the market participants have started shorting BTC, which has now outperformed the longs. The data from Coinglass suggests a huge accumulation of Bitcoin shorts. As seen in the above chart, huge bets have been placed against Bitcoin shorts, which have outnumbered longs by 10:1. While the number of longs leveraged is around $10 million, the longs leveraged shorts have reached above $1.52 billion. However, another huge cluster is around $78,565 and breaking below this range is believed to push the price below $75,000. What’s Next for the Bitcoin (BTC) Price Rally? The weekly chart of Bitcoin has turned extremely bearish as the one single weekly candle has squashed all the gains incurred in the past several months. The bullish sentiments of the traders are slowly plunging, hunting towards more dreadful days approaching the BTC price rally. Presently, the price is heading towards crucial support, and if the bulls fail to defend these levels, another 20% pullback could drag the levels below the previous highs. The BTC price has plunged and is testing the crucial support, which had been a strong resistance during the previous bull run. The bulls are required to trigger a rebound from here, or else the token is feared to repeat the previous pattern. Previously, in 2022, the price broke down from the ascending trend line and dumped hard to the support zone along the 2018 highs, which formed the bottom of the prevailing bear market. Therefore, if the Bitcoin (BTC) price fails to rebound and breaks the support at $72,207, the selling pressure may escalate, dragging the levels close to previous highs close to $69,000.

This decision marks a significant shift in how meme coins are treated by U.S. regulators. While the SEC is stepping back from enforcement, other agencies such as the CFTC may still pursue actions against fraud related to meme coins. This move could open up new opportunities for innovation within the meme coin space but also raises concerns about potential fraud and scams in the market. According to the SEC, meme coins are generally purchased for entertainment, social interaction, or cultural reasons, with their value driven primarily by speculation and market demand. The Commission stated that because these coins often have little to no functional use, they do not qualify as securities under U.S. federal laws. In light of this, the SEC has decided to stop enforcing securities regulations on meme coins, marking a shift in its approach to crypto regulation. This shift aligns with comments made by Commissioner Hester ""Crypto Mom"" Peirce, who suggested that the SEC may seek to delegate enforcement responsibilities for meme coins to other agencies like the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Despite this loosening of regulations, the SEC made it clear that it will continue to take action against fraudulent behavior related to meme coins. The Commission emphasized that fraud involving the offer and sale of meme coins could still be prosecuted under other federal and state laws by different agencies. Essentially, while the SEC is backing off from regulating meme coins, it has sent a message that scammers should still be cautious as other regulators may take action against them. Fraud prevention remains a priority, but the SEC has signaled a hands-off approach to the broader meme coin space. This new policy is seen by many as a positive development for the crypto industry, as it could encourage more innovation and activity within the meme coin market. The lighter regulatory approach could allow more projects to emerge and encourage more people to participate in the meme coin space. The decision may also lead to greater involvement from public figures and celebrities who could launch their own meme coins, potentially leading to more market hype and excitement. However, there is a downside to this change. The meme coin market has been plagued with scams, and the SEC’s reduced involvement could create a situation where fraudulent activities proliferate. High-profile scams, such as the LIBRA rug pull and the North Korean Lazarus Group’s use of meme coins to launder stolen funds, highlight the potential risks in this space. While the SEC is stepping back from enforcement, there remains a need for consumer protection in an industry prone to manipulation and fraud. The long-term impact of this decision is uncertain. On one hand, looser restrictions could foster greater creativity and expansion in the meme coin market, as new projects and coins emerge without the fear of heavy regulation. On the other hand, this could also lead to an increase in risky or fraudulent projects, as the barrier for launching meme coins becomes lower. The SEC’s decision may allow for more celebrity-driven coin launches and pump-and-dump schemes, further contributing to the market's instability. Overall, the SEC’s new policy signals a shift toward a more relaxed stance on meme coins, which could stimulate innovation and activity in the market. However, it also presents challenges, as the reduction in oversight may lead to an uptick in scams and fraudulent activities. The key question moving forward is whether other regulatory bodies will step in to fill the gap left by the SEC’s withdrawal, ensuring that consumer protection remains a priority without stifling the potential for growth in the meme coin space. This is a moment of transition for the meme coin market, and only time will tell how it will evolve under the new regulatory environment.",,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|COMMODITY|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-28 08:08:39

Out of these, nearly half were liquidated on BTC, but Geoff Kendrick’s trust in this digital asset remains maintained, as he forecasts a massive rally. More importantly, he doubled his initial Bitcoin price prediction, claiming to witness $500k by the end of Donald Trump’s presidency. Let’s dive into that. Inside Geoff Kendrick’s $500K Bitcoin Price Prediction: What’s Driving It? Geoff Kendrick, the head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, is a renowned name in the crypto industry. He is among the top crypto supporters and has often presented forecasts. In a recent interview with CNBC, Kendrick reiterated his belief that institutional adoption and regulatory clarity will propel BTC to new heights. He pointed out the growing institutional interest in digital assets and that major financial institutions like BlackRock and Standard Chartered, which are working toward integrating BTC into traditional finance, are the driving forces behind massive growth. More importantly, Kenrick believes that volatility and market turbulence will settle over time as large investors approach the industry. What we need are traditional financial players, like Standard Chartered, BlackRock, and others that have ETFs now to really step in,” Kendrick stated. Among these discussions, the highlight of the interview is his prediction that the Bitcoin price would be $500k by the end of Donald Trump’s presidency. Before this, he also predicted that BTC would hit $200k by the end of 2025, That should add to that medium term, top-side potential, which for me is bitcoin up to $200,000 this year, and $500,000 before Trump leaves office. This statement came as Kendrick discussed how clearer regulations, particularly in the U.S., will open the doors for institutional investors, who will be key drivers of BTC’s price surge. He also discussed regulations as the solution to security risk, citing the recent Bybit hack. As the industry becomes more institutionalized, it should be safer,” Kendrick noted, highlighting how security risks—like the recent $1.4 billion Bybit hack—could be mitigated through regulated financial entities. Geoff Kendrick’s forecast considers the growing adoption, the emergence of institutional investors, and better regularity clarity. However, the ongoing market turbulence cannot be ignored due to such bullish Bitcoin price predictions. Bitcoin’s Brutal Sell-Off and Market Conditions Geoff Kendrick has attempted to shape investors’ trust in this asset, but the most significant current correction cannot be ignored. Although Bitcoin achieved the ATH of $109.1k, it plunged to $80k this week, which is the biggest correction in months. This crypto market crash has resulted in the liquidation of $860M, with $707M in long positions. This happened as the BTC ETF witnessed record-breaking outflows of $938M and growing tensions over Trump’s tariff introduction. However, crypto influencers still call it a buying opportunity, boosting investor sentiments. Market Sentiment: Investors Are More Confident This Time Despite the market sell-off, the Santiment report claims that crypto traders are optimistic despite the price crash. The firm concludes the market discussion on various social media platforms and claims that investors view this dip as a prime buying opportunity. Traders are showing a very high level of confidence that this dip is ‘the one to buy, ‘” the report stated. Crypto personalities like Geoff Kendrick, Michael Saylor, and Matt Houghan have played a significant role. The founder of Microstrategy even advised investors to sell their kidneys if necessary but hold their BTC. Sell a kidney if you must, but keep the Bitcoin, posted Michael Salor Although this statement received backlash, he is known for such rational advice. Additionally, Matt Houghan claimed that this was the right time to buy BTC. Notably, such posts and their advice on buying the dip affected investors’ sentiments. However, Santients’ report also warned that excessive optimism can be a threat, as it often leads to further correction. Will Geoff Kendrick’s $500k Prediction Come True? Since Donald Trump’s win in the US election, the price of Bitcoin has surged exponentially, showcasing impressive gains. Many analysts, including Standard Chartered’s Geoff Kendrick, have presented a bullish outlook for this digital asset in 2025 and beyond. Although the market is experiencing short-term volatility, confidence among market enthusiasts is still high. As Kendrick’s prediction is based on adoption and regularity, the $200k target may be achieved in 2025 and higher in the future. However, this is just an anticipation, and the market’s uncertainty could bring different results.

The agency equated themed cryptos to collectibles, making them immune to federal securities laws. The regulator stated : Meme coins typically are purchased for entertainment, social interaction, and cultural purposes, and their value is driven primarily by market demand and speculation. In this regard, meme coins are akin to collectibles. The regulator stated that these tokens don’t offer rights to future returns, assets, or income – the key elements in determining an asset’s security status.

For instance, they have dropped multiple suits recently, including Uniswap, Coinbase, and Gemini. Meme market outlook: TRUMP leads downtrends Meme coins slumped further despite the regulator’s bullish stance, with Official Trump leading the downside.

This Undervalued Crypto is Gaining Major Traction,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/02/the-best-altcoin-to-hold-for-2025-this-undervalued-crypto-is-gaining-major-traction,"2025 is a post-halving year, which historically means a bullish surge is expected. This could be the biggest bull market ever as the institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies is at its highest. Therefore, investors are eager to know the best altcoin to hold to be on the winning side in this bull run. In this text, we will discuss experts’ choice of the best altcoin to hold and why the project stands out. Undervalue Gem that Experts Believe is the Best Altcoin to Hold In 2025, AI and blockchain are colliding harder than ever. Also, the world generally is moving towards AI based projects and the announcement of the Stargate project by Donald Trump further fuels this narrative. Therefore, AI altcoins are the major focus of savvy investors as they are expected to deliver the most ROI. PropiChain (PCHAIN) , a decentralized real estate marketplace project, stands out to experts. This is due to its innovative approach to reshaping the global real estate market with AI tech at its core and other tools like the Metaverse and blockchain. The project has been gaining traction in the early CoinMarketCap listing bolstered the project's visibility and also earned it credibility in the global cryptocurrency market. Early investors that participated in the first round of PCHAIN’s crypto presale are already in profit by more than 150%. It is currently going for $0.011 in the second round and this lowest because it will increase by more than 100% in the next phase. Factors Behind the Massive Traction that PropiChain is Gaining PropiChain's proposed improvements to the real estate sector have enticed investors to use AI altcoin. Traders will gain easy entry into the global real estate market and have better purchasing experience with PCHAIN’s fractional ownership model. Users of the decentralized platform will be able to own percentages in assets with as little as $100. With AI technology at its core, PCHAIN users can enjoy simplified assets and investment management. For instance, the vastness of the $300 trillion industry often makes identifying and picking the best opportunities difficult for investors. However, with the advanced filtering model on PCHAIN’s decentralized platform, properties that meet your investment goals can be highlighted when you search for advanced criteria like strong rental properties, etc. Artificial intelligence also handles complex calculations concerning property valuation. It uses the Automated Valuation Model, which ensures properties are not overvalued or undervalued. This is because the AVMs can access the historical price performances and the current trends, eliminating the chances of overpaying or being underpaid. PCHAIN users will also enjoy simplified transactions because AI assists in automating some naturally stressful activities. For instance, if you wish to buy or sell an asset when the value hits a certain price, you can automate the operation. Instead of monitoring the market yourself, the PCHAIN AI will execute your wish once the terms are met. The predictive market analysis feature of the AI will help new and existing users make sound investment decisions. The AI-driven appraisal of statistics from different sources will help you identify properties that will grow in value from those that will fall. These will aid strategic decisions by PCHAIN investors. Another standout feature of PCHAIN is the Metaverse feature. This opens the door of global real estate for international buyers and sellers to inspect assets, display listed ones, and for them to interact to reach an agreement. Smart contracts on PropiChain's decentralized platform can automate lease contracts and also execute renewals. For example, you can set your lease terms, and once another user accepts them, a binding lease agreement will be created. All these are completed and stored on PropiChain's public ledger. Renewing contracts without physical meetings will be another advantage PCHAIN users will have over other investors. Once the updated renewal terms are met, your initial agreement is updated automatically without any need for legal papers or intermediaries. Why PropiChain’s Presale Is the Best Bet in 2025 Hereunder, we will look into some of the reasons why PropiChain is believed to be the best coin to hold and why joining the presale is the ultimate move. Increase Predictions: Different experts and multiple analysts have forecasted the growth potential of PCHAIN. These experts believe PropiChain could deliver a 42600% surge by early 2025 Q2. Legitimacy: Transparency, legitimacy, and the protection of users’ interest is a big deal for PropiChain. This has been confirmed by BlockAudit , a top security auditing firm in Web3 that reviewed PCHAIN. The report indicated that the platform adopted top-notch protocols to secure investors’ assets and block any form of technical fraud. Industry Tide: The broader market shift in the crypto space is towards AI and RWA. Fortunately, PropiChain is an innovative project that aims to utilize AI to shape the RWA. Early Gains: Investors that joined from the first round are already in profit by more than 150%. Joining now when it is at the lowest price it could ever offer you a chance to be in more than 100% profit when the next round starts. Also, with the predicted growth, an investment of $1000 in this round could yield more than $420,000 by early Q2 of 2025. Conclusion The real-world application of PropiChain in a multi-trillion dollar sector is one of the many reasons why investors believe it is the best altcoin to hold. Fortunately, the current low entry price in its presale is offering investors a unique opportunity to accumulate as many tokens as possible before it soars. If you missed the early stages of established projects like Solana and Ethereum, PropiChain is offering you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to position for a project that can replicate and even outperform their early run.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $3.98 by the end of 2028. By 2031, WIF’s price may surge to $6.46. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. However, a massive bear market ensued, and WIF lost momentum. Leaving investors asking: How high can dogwifhat crypto go? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $0.64 Market cap $572,272,889.11 Trading volume $342,641,465.12 Circulating supply 998,841,207.34 WIF All-time high $4.85 on March 31, 2024 All-time low $0.000023 on November 2023 24-hour high $0.6012 24-hour low $0.5486 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 25.98% 50-day SMA $1.112 14-Day RSI 33.65 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 16 (Extreme Fear) Green days 7/30 (23%) 200-Day SMA $2.07 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis: WIF to break past resistance at $0.669? TL;DR Breakdown WIF is currently in the oversold region. Dogwifhat (WIF) resistance is present at around $0.590. WIF’s immediate support level is present at $0.536. Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart: WIF struggles to break out of bearish trend The 1-day chart for WIF on February 28 shows the coin trading below the 20, 50, and 200-day SMA and struggling to recover from a prolonged bearish trend. WIF gained some momentum but hit resistance at $0.669, causing a decline to the $0.536 – $0.590 range. The MACD, on the other hand, suggests growing buying momentum, as the MACD line is above the signal line. WIF struggles to break out of a bearish trend The RSI indicates the asset is in oversold territory, hinting at a potential bounce provided buyers pump in liquidity. A break above $0.669 is needed to confirm any signs of recovery, while a drop below the $0.536 support region could result in a further decline towards $0.4. Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart: WIF shows consolidation after a minor upside The 4-hour WIF/USDT chart suggests possible short-term consolidation after a minor upside. Dogwifhat currently trades just above the middle Bollinger Band (a short-term support level). A bounce from this level could lead to another attempt at the $0.620 resistance level. WIF shows consolidation after a minor upside The Balance of Power (BOP) suggests that the bulls are gaining some hold on the market. However, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicates money outflows, which could limit any potential upside in the short term. WIF needs to recapture the $0.610 price level and break past resistance at $0.620 to confirm the position of the BOP indicator. Dogwifhat technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.9185 SELL SMA 5 $0.7951 SELL SMA 10 $0.8307 SELL SMA 21 $0.7279 SELL SMA 50 $1.1123 SELL SMA 100 $1.8528 SELL SMA 200 $2.07 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.7798 SELL EMA 5 $0.9474 SELL EMA 10 $1.2288 SELL EMA 21 $1.5698 SELL EMA 50 $2.04 SELL EMA 100 $2.26 SELL EMA 200 $2.28 SELL What to expect from WIF price analysis? The broader outlook for WIF is bearish. In the meantime, a recapture and break out of the $0.610 – $0.669 price level is needed to confirm a possible bullish reversal, while a long-term push above $0.719 could signal a sustainable uptrend. A failed bullish attempt could result in further price declines towards $0.503. Is Dogwifhat crypto a good investment? Dogwifhat (WIF) is a meme coin on the Solana blockchain. Its value is driven by community interest and speculation. Projections indicate that by 2025, the price could recover to about $1.5 to $2. While it may have potential for short-term gains, it’s equally risky. Only invest after thorough research. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank and several other s . Why is $WIF down? WIF is down after facing rejection at $0.5875. The coin is down due to diminishing market interest and folding liquidity triggered by massive selloffs and a shift to other assets that investors consider more profitable. Dogwifhat (WIF) price chart | Coinmarketcap Will WIF reach $10? Having reached a peak price of $4.85 in 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Can Dogwifhat reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and could be unlikely. Its market must be at least $99.9 billion – a value that exceeds the highest market cap ever for a meme (Dogecoin) at $88.79 billion. DOGE’s marketcap history | GlobalData Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $1.5 by 2025 and about $6 to $8 by 2031. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

With more Bitcoin investors aiming to amplify their returns by not just holding, but staking, their assets in DeFi protocols, liquid staking has cemented its status as a go-to channel. And this recent burst in the Bitcoin LST ecosystem definitely derives from the generally perceived merits of liquid-staking products. Key Players in the Bitcoin LST Ecosystem Bitcoin liquid staking is an emerging sector within the digital asset space that allows users to stake their Bitcoin while not having to surrender access to their assets. Liquid staking lets users effectively do two things simultaneously: earn staking rewards and retain liquid access to their Bitcoin. Prominent key actors in the space—such as Lombard Finance, Pumpbtcxyz, and Solv Protocol—are busy at work pushing this young market forward. Lombard Finance is at the front with 20,140.31 LBTC in total value locked. This protocol has positioned itself as one of the most commanding forces in the Bitcoin liquid staking arena. By giving users the chance to stake Bitcoin and receive LBTC tokens, Lombard Finance has amassed a hefty portion of the market’s liquidity. That liquidity is being deployed in any number of directions throughout the DeFi universe, with users of LIquid Staking BTC supposedly reaping the benefits of two yield streams: staking and whatever else they may be doing with LBTC. Is that it? Is two streams better than one? Following closely is Solv Protocol, a protocol recognized for its innovative take on liquid staking and decentralized finance. With its staking solutions, especially the SolvBTC.BBN token—which boasts a total value locked of 10,049.11 BTC—Solv has attracted quite a bit of attention. Solv Protocol stands out for successfully weaving together liquid staking with an assortment of DeFi instruments and providing users with an array of yield farming and liquidity options. Besides the protocol’s BTC-centered solutions and the SolvBTC.BBN in particular, Solv offers new kinds of instruments that appear to draw on its core expertise. These new instruments hint at a much broader user base SOV is courting: investors that venture into all kinds of liquidity and yield opportunities. Another significant player in this space is pumpbtcxyz, with 6,267.79 pumpBTC, providing liquidity and yield opportunities for Bitcoin holders through its innovative staking mechanisms. The rise of pumpBTC shows the Bitcoin LST market is not limited to just a few dominant players. Bitcoin Liquid Staking Token Outlook Recording the current landscape of the Bitcoin LST market with more than $4B in total value locked. @Lombard_Finance – 20,140.31 LBTC @SolvProtocol – 10,049.11 SolvBTC.BBN @Pumpbtcxyz – 6,267.79 pumpBTC @Bedrock_DeFi – 4,248.44… pic.twitter.com/SC2HztbOX7 — Bitcoin Ecosystem (@BitcoinEcoTK) February 26, 2025 Other Notable Players in the Market Although Lombard Finance, Solv Protocol, and Pumpbtcxyz are leading in the race, other protocols have started to make extraordinary inroads with captivating Bitcoin liquid staking solutions. Bedrock DeFi—a far cry from the traditional DeFi narrative—has, with its 4,248.44 uniBTC, put together a staking solution for Bitcoin holders with an emphasis on security and scalability. Its users can confidently stake their assets and earn rewards thanks to Bedrock’s architecture. Lorenzo Protocol’s stBTC token (which has, at last count, a 1,451.51 stBTC TVL) has also gained traction due to its excellent liquid staking mechanism, which allows users to access liquidity while they stake their Bitcoin. Acorn Network, which has 1,197.14 aBTC, is becoming a prominent player in the liquid Bitcoin staking arena. The protocol focuses not just on sustainability—still a hot topic in the crypto space—but also on providing long-term yield strategies for Bitcoin holders. Acorn Network offers a risk-reward ratio that is far more appealing for liquid staking than what’s currently available from other projects. Newer entrants such as allo.xyz and pStakeFinance are driving innovation with their own liquid staking tokens. alloBTC, which is backed by 544.13 BTC, and YBTC from pStakeFinance, with a TVL of 300 BTC, are examples of the growing diversification within the Bitcoin LST ecosystem. These are much smaller players in comparison to Coinbase and BlackRock. But as they continue to evolve, the novel staking strategies, liquidity mechanisms, and other barely imagined provisions of their Bitcoin LSTs could have a profound impact on the market. The Future of Bitcoin Liquid Staking Total value locked exceeds $4 billion, signaling growth. DeFi users have long demanded the ability to generate returns without forfeiting access to their funds. By introducing the concept of liquid staking, protocols now offer a new way to achieve that. Over the next few months, it will be captivating to see how rivalry among these protocols develops and how new advancements in staking technologies might affect the landscape. An interest in liquid staking that is burgeoning means that the future of Bitcoin LSTs is bright and seems to hold a lot of prospects for crypto investors who either are or are not fiends for the fast-paced action they might experience on Wall Street.

40952624,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=135258,1740734639,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,China’s Shock Response: Trump’s Tariffs Threaten Crypto Market Stability,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/chinas-vow-against-trumps-tariffs/,"Hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts! The global economic stage is heating up once again, and this time, it’s the escalating trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies, the United States and China, taking center stage. When former U.S. President Donald Trump slapped an extra 10% tariff on Chinese goods, the dragon didn’t just sit back and take it. China, a major player in the cryptocurrency landscape, swiftly announced it would take “all necessary measures” in response. But what does this mean for your crypto portfolio? Let’s dive into the potential ripple effects of this trade tussle and how it could impact the volatile world of digital currencies. Decoding China’s Stance on Tariffs: What ‘Necessary Measures’ Really Means When China says it will take “all necessary measures,” it’s not just diplomatic rhetoric. It’s a clear signal of intent to retaliate and protect its economic interests. But what kind of measures are we talking about? While the official statement is deliberately vague, we can infer potential actions based on past trade disputes and current geopolitical dynamics. These measures could range from: Increased Tariffs on U.S. Goods: This is the most direct and expected response. China could impose or increase tariffs on a range of American products, mirroring the U.S. actions. This tit-for-tat approach is a classic feature of trade wars and can escalate quickly. Non-Tariff Barriers: Beyond tariffs, China might implement non-tariff barriers, such as stricter regulations, customs delays, or increased scrutiny on U.S. businesses operating in China. These measures can be just as damaging as tariffs and harder to quantify. Currency Devaluation: While less likely to be explicitly stated, China could allow its currency, the Yuan, to depreciate. A weaker Yuan makes Chinese exports cheaper and U.S. imports more expensive, effectively offsetting the impact of tariffs. However, this is a double-edged sword with potential risks to China’s own economy. Strategic Resource Control: China is a major player in global supply chains, particularly for rare earth minerals crucial for various industries, including technology and renewable energy. Restricting exports of these resources could be a strategic countermeasure. For the cryptocurrency market, these measures can indirectly and directly create volatility and uncertainty. Let’s explore how. The Shockwaves Through the Cryptocurrency Market: Impact of US China Trade War The cryptocurrency market, known for its inherent volatility, is particularly sensitive to global economic shifts. The US China Trade War and the resulting trade tensions can act as a significant catalyst for market fluctuations. Here’s how: Investor Sentiment and Risk Aversion Trade wars breed uncertainty. When major economies clash, investors tend to become risk-averse. This often leads to a flight to safety, where investors move their capital away from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies towards more traditional safe havens like gold or government bonds. A decrease in investor confidence can trigger sell-offs in the crypto market, leading to price drops. Global Economic Slowdown Concerns Escalating trade tensions can hinder global economic growth. Tariffs increase the cost of goods, disrupt supply chains, and reduce overall trade volume. A slowdown in the global economy can impact various sectors, and the cryptocurrency market is not immune. Reduced economic activity can translate to less disposable income for investment, potentially affecting the inflow of funds into cryptocurrencies. Supply Chain Disruptions and Technological Impacts The US China Trade War has significant implications for technology supply chains. Many cryptocurrency mining operations and hardware manufacturers rely on global supply chains, often involving components from both the US and China. Tariffs and trade restrictions can disrupt these supply chains, increasing costs for miners and potentially affecting the efficiency and profitability of mining operations. This, in turn, can influence the supply and demand dynamics within the crypto market. Currency Fluctuations and Crypto as a Hedge? As mentioned earlier, currency devaluation is a potential tool in trade wars. Fluctuations in fiat currencies, particularly the Yuan and the US dollar, can impact cryptocurrency prices. Some investors view cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, as a hedge against fiat currency devaluation and economic uncertainty. In times of global economic turmoil, we might see increased interest in cryptocurrencies as a store of value, potentially driving up demand and prices. However, this is not a guaranteed outcome, and the crypto market’s reaction can be complex and unpredictable. China Tariffs and the Crypto Mining Landscape: A Looming Shadow? China’s role in cryptocurrency mining is undeniable, despite recent crackdowns. While the Chinese government has taken steps to curb domestic crypto mining, Chinese entities still hold significant influence in the global mining landscape. Trump’s China tariffs , and China’s retaliatory measures, could cast a shadow over this sector. Let’s consider the potential impacts: Impact Area Potential Effect on Crypto Mining Increased Costs of Mining Hardware Tariffs on imported components could raise the cost of mining equipment, making mining less profitable, especially for smaller operations. Supply Chain Bottlenecks Disruptions in global supply chains could lead to delays in obtaining mining hardware and components, impacting mining capacity and expansion plans. Shift in Mining Geographies Higher costs and operational challenges in regions affected by trade tensions might incentivize miners to relocate to areas with more favorable trade policies and energy costs. Impact on Mining Pools Mining pools with significant operations in affected regions could face operational challenges, potentially leading to shifts in hash rate distribution across different pools. It’s important to note that the long-term effects on crypto mining are still uncertain and will depend on the duration and intensity of the US China Trade War. Navigating the Trade Tension Turbulence: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what can crypto investors do to navigate these turbulent times of trade tensions and potential market volatility? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on developments in the US China Trade War and their potential impact on the cryptocurrency market impact . Follow reputable news sources and crypto market analysis platforms. Diversify Your Portfolio: Diversification is key in volatile markets. Don’t put all your eggs in one crypto basket. Consider diversifying across different cryptocurrencies and asset classes to mitigate risk. Manage Risk: Understand your risk tolerance and adjust your investment strategy accordingly. Consider using risk management tools like stop-loss orders to limit potential losses. Long-Term Perspective: Cryptocurrency investments are often viewed as long-term plays. Try to avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term market fluctuations driven by trade war news. Consider Stablecoins: In times of extreme volatility, you might consider temporarily parking some of your crypto holdings in stablecoins to preserve capital and reduce exposure to price swings. The Unfolding Drama: What’s Next for China Tariffs and Crypto? The situation surrounding China tariffs and the US China Trade War is dynamic and constantly evolving. The “necessary measures” China will take remain to be seen, and the impact on the cryptocurrency market impact will unfold over time. The crypto market’s reaction will depend on a multitude of factors, including the specific nature of China’s response, overall investor sentiment, and broader global economy trends. While trade wars introduce uncertainty and potential risks, they also create opportunities. Periods of volatility can be opportune times for strategic investors to accumulate assets at lower prices. The key is to stay informed, manage risk effectively, and maintain a long-term perspective in the face of short-term market turbulence. The shock of these trade tensions is a reminder of the interconnectedness of the global economy and the cryptocurrency market. As the drama unfolds, one thing is certain: the crypto world will be watching closely, adapting, and innovating in response to these unprecedented challenges.

40952702,https://nulltx.com/?p=146039,1740734687,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Whale 0x3d6 Makes Strategic Buys of AAVE and MKR, Adding $1.67M in stETH to Their Portfolio",https://nulltx.com/whale-0x3d6-makes-strategic-buys-of-aave-and-mkr-adding-1-67m-in-steth-to-their-portfolio/,"A major shift has occurred within the last six hours, executed by a leading crypto whale known as 0x3d6, who undertook large-scale trading. This individual converted 720 stETH (valued at roughly $1.67 million) into two major assets: AAVE and MKR. These trades gave a lot of people (including us) in the crypto market pause to think. Why? Because 0x3d6 is clearly using some sort of concentrated accumulation strategy in the DeFi space. A Strategic Play in AAVE and MKR First, 0x3d6 swapped 460 stETH—roughly $1.07 million—for 5,288 AAVE at an average price of $201.96 per token. This was the whale’s first purchase of AAVE, which many consider a core asset in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. With the swap, 0x3d6 now holds 6,635 AAVE, worth about $1.35 million. The price point was advantageous, and analysts estimate the whale’s current unrealized profit at around $216,000, for a gain of approximately 13.8%. After the AAVE swap, the whale turned its attention to MKR, the governance token of the MakerDAO ecosystem. In this trade, 0x3d6 swapped 260 stETH—worth $604,000—for 365.5 MKR at an average price of $1,652 per token. This is the whale’s second MKR purchase and follows a previous trade made between August 31, 2023, and July 22, 2024, where the whale made an estimated profit of $603,000, or 101%, on its MKR holdings. The whale’s continued interest in MKR is a sign of strong belief in the long-term value of the MakerDAO ecosystem, which has continued to show resilience in the DeFi sector. In the past 6 hours, whale 0x3d6 spent 720 stETH ($1.67M) to buy AAVE and MKR: Swapped 460 stETH ($1.07M) for 5,288 AAVE at an average price of $201.96 Swapped 260 stETH ($604K) for 365.5 MKR at an average price of $1,652 pic.twitter.com/EbkcIY1uFo — EyeOnChain (@EyeOnChain) February 27, 2025 Historical Context of Whale’s Trading Strategy A glimpse into the sophisticated trading strategy behind these transactions can be gleaned from the whale’s track record. The last MKR trade, which earned over $600,000, underscores 0x3d6’s knack for unearthing the kinds of golden DeFi opportunities that many miss. In its chase of the MKR profits, this whale moved in and out of positions with inhuman grace and perfect timing. Now, it’s buying more Maker and reinforces our read of this increasingly confident whale as one that is staking a big bet on the DeFi ecosystem. For AAVE, this is the whale’s first foray into the asset, but the size of the trade and the strategic nature of the purchase point toward a well-calculated entry into the DeFi lending protocol. AAVE has long been one of the leading assets in the DeFi space, and with its extensive use case in decentralized borrowing and lending, it is no surprise that 0x3d6 has chosen to build a substantial position in the token. What Do These Trades Mean for the Market? The recent developments with whale 0x3d6 have important effects for AAVE and MKR. The whale’s actions are particularly interesting because it’s a very large investor in these two tokens. When it makes a move, it’s of interest not only for what it could mean for AAVE and MKR individually but also because it might signal a trend for other big institutional investors or traders to follow. (And to be clear, the kind of move 0x3d6 just made is definitely one that could inspire other market participants to go in the same direction.) Whales concentrating on DeFi-related tokens such as AAVE and MKR indicates a trend where the biggest players in the space are taking decentralized finance seriously. This development is also signaling that some of the very largest and very smartest money in the world is acquiring serious DeFi tokens. In the Fi side of things, this is also just a sign that institutional players are in the cryptocurrency markets and either on their way or have arrived already. The trades highlight the importance of liquid staking tokens like stETH, which are increasingly used for large-scale trades. When the whale converted stETH into assets like AAVE and MKR, it maintained exposure to the broader DeFi ecosystem and secured potentially higher returns than what traditional assets could offer. Conclusion Whale 0x3d6’s recent AAVE and MKR trades worth $1.67 million in total provide a glimpse into the strategies that large DeFi investors are employing. Increasingly, these investors are diversifying not only across different asset classes but also within their portfolio of DeFi assets. By doing both, they seem to be banking on the DeFi revolution to continued unfold in the coming years. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

CryptoQuant CEO Sets Critical BTC Price Level at $75K,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-bull-cycle-intact-price/,"Is the Bitcoin bull run still on track? Amidst the ever-turbulent crypto market, investors are constantly seeking signals to decipher the prevailing trends. CryptoQuant CEO, Ki Young Ju, a prominent voice in crypto market analysis, has recently shared his insights on the Bitcoin bull cycle, offering a crucial price point to watch. Let’s dive into his analysis and understand what it means for the future of Bitcoin and the broader crypto landscape. Is the Bitcoin Bull Cycle Truly Intact? CryptoQuant CEO Weighs In Ki Young Ju, the CEO of CryptoQuant, a well-regarded on-chain analytics platform, has taken to X (formerly Twitter) to express his continued bullish sentiment on Bitcoin (BTC). He firmly believes that the Bitcoin bull cycle is not over, offering a beacon of hope for those invested in the leading cryptocurrency. However, he also injected a dose of realism, highlighting a critical price level that could potentially invalidate his optimistic outlook. According to Ki Young Ju, a significant drop below $75,000 for BTC would signal a shift in his perspective. This price point acts as a crucial line in the sand, separating a healthy consolidation phase within a bull market from a potential trend reversal. While acknowledging the possibility of a 30% drawdown – a common occurrence in the volatile crypto space – his core thesis remains bullish as long as Bitcoin stays above this key threshold. Key Takeaways from CryptoQuant CEO’s Analysis: Bullish Stance: Ki Young Ju maintains a bullish outlook on Bitcoin, indicating confidence in the continuation of the current bull cycle. Critical Price Level: $75,000 is identified as a crucial level. A significant drop below this point would challenge his bullish view. 30% Drawdown Possible: He acknowledges the potential for a substantial price correction, which is typical in crypto markets, but views it as part of the bull cycle as long as the $75K level holds. Understanding Liquidity and its Role in the Crypto Market Analysis To further elaborate on his viewpoint, Ki Young Ju delved into the crucial concept of liquidity within the crypto market analysis. He explained that during distribution phases, price declines are often triggered by a drying up of liquidity. This makes the influx of fresh liquidity paramount to prevent a temporary dip from morphing into a prolonged bear market. Liquidity, in simple terms, refers to the ease with which assets can be bought and sold without causing significant price fluctuations. In the context of Bitcoin and the broader crypto market, high liquidity is essential for sustained price appreciation. When liquidity diminishes, selling pressure can intensify, leading to sharper price drops as there are fewer buyers to absorb the selling volume. Why is Liquidity So Important in a Bull Cycle? Price Stability: High liquidity provides a buffer against large price swings, contributing to market stability. Sustained Growth: New liquidity, often driven by new investors or increased institutional interest, fuels further price appreciation in a bull market. Market Confidence: Healthy liquidity signals a robust and active market, fostering confidence among investors. BTC Price Consolidation: What to Expect Next? Ki Young Ju anticipates a period of consolidation for BTC price, likely within a broad range of $75,000 to $100,000. He draws a parallel to the early months of 2024, a period characterized by price consolidation before the next major upward move. This phase of consolidation is considered a natural part of market cycles, allowing the market to digest previous gains and prepare for the next leg up. This expected consolidation phase suggests that Bitcoin may trade sideways for a while, fluctuating within the mentioned range. Such periods can be frustrating for traders seeking quick profits, but they are often necessary for building a stronger foundation for future growth. The duration and intensity of this consolidation will largely depend on market sentiment and the influx of new liquidity. Factors Influencing BTC Price Consolidation: Factor Impact on Consolidation Market Sentiment Positive sentiment can shorten consolidation; negative sentiment can prolong it. Liquidity Inflow Strong liquidity inflow can break consolidation upwards; weak inflow can lead to prolonged sideways movement. Macroeconomic Factors External economic events (e.g., interest rate changes) can influence investor risk appetite and impact consolidation. Regulatory Developments Positive regulatory news can boost market confidence and potentially shorten consolidation. The Role of Positive News in Attracting New Liquidity According to CryptoQuant CEO, positive news is the catalyst needed to attract fresh liquidity and propel Bitcoin out of its consolidation phase. This positive news could stem from various sources, including favorable regulatory updates, increased institutional adoption, technological advancements in the Bitcoin ecosystem, or positive macroeconomic indicators. The crypto market is highly sensitive to news flow. Positive developments tend to generate excitement and FOMO (Fear of Missing Out), attracting new investors and capital into the market. This influx of new funds is precisely what is needed to inject fresh liquidity and break through resistance levels, potentially initiating the next phase of the Bitcoin bull cycle. Examples of Positive News that Could Trigger Liquidity Influx: Spot Bitcoin ETF Approvals: Further approvals in different jurisdictions would signal increased mainstream acceptance and attract institutional capital. Favorable Regulatory Frameworks: Clear and supportive regulations can reduce uncertainty and encourage broader adoption. Technological Upgrades: Improvements to Bitcoin’s scalability, security, or functionality can enhance its appeal and drive investment. Institutional Adoption Announcements: Major corporations or financial institutions announcing Bitcoin adoption or investment can boost market confidence. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what does this analysis mean for you as a crypto investor? Here are some actionable insights based on CryptoQuant CEO’s perspective: Monitor the $75K Level: Keep a close watch on Bitcoin’s price action around the $75,000 mark. This is a critical level according to Ki Young Ju’s analysis. Stay Informed on Market Liquidity: Pay attention to indicators of market liquidity. Increased liquidity generally supports bullish trends. Watch for Positive News Catalysts: Be aware of potential positive news developments that could trigger a new wave of liquidity and price appreciation. Prepare for Consolidation: Expect a period of price consolidation in the $75,000 – $100,000 range. Use this time to strategize and manage your portfolio. Maintain a Long-Term Perspective: Remember that bull cycles and consolidations are natural parts of the crypto market. Focus on the long-term potential of Bitcoin and the crypto space. Conclusion: Navigating the Bitcoin Bull Cycle with Informed Optimism CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju’s analysis provides valuable insights into the current state of the Bitcoin bull cycle. While maintaining a bullish outlook, he emphasizes the importance of the $75,000 price level and the role of liquidity in sustaining market momentum. The anticipated consolidation phase presents an opportunity for investors to strategize and prepare for the next potential upward surge, driven by positive news and renewed liquidity. By staying informed and understanding these key market dynamics, investors can navigate the Bitcoin bull cycle with informed optimism and make strategic decisions.

40952764,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=135257,1740734806,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Warning: Why ‘Buy the Dip’ Frenzy Could Trigger a Shocking Price Drop,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-buy-the-dip-warning/,"Are you feeling that familiar urge to ‘buy the dip’ as Bitcoin (BTC) navigates recent price fluctuations? You’re not alone. Across the crypto sphere, from the bustling threads of X (formerly Twitter) to the in-depth discussions on Reddit, Telegram, 4Chan, BitcoinTalk, and Farcaster, the chorus of ‘buy the dip’ is growing louder. But before you jump in headfirst, a crucial on-chain analysis from Santiment might just make you pause and reconsider your strategy. Could this widespread optimism actually be a warning sign for Bitcoin , potentially foreshadowing further price declines? Let’s dive deep into what Santiment’s data reveals and what it means for your crypto portfolio. Decoding Crypto Sentiment: Is ‘Buy the Dip’ a Trap? Santiment, a leading on-chain analytics platform, recently highlighted a fascinating trend: a significant surge in mentions of “buy the dip” across various social and crypto-centric platforms. This might seem like a bullish indicator at first glance – after all, strong buying interest often suggests market confidence. However, Santiment’s analysis suggests a more nuanced, and potentially bearish, interpretation. They point out that in the often unpredictable world of cryptocurrency, crypto sentiment can be a contrarian indicator. When the crowd is overwhelmingly confident, it might actually signal an impending market correction. Here’s the core concept: Crowd Psychology in Crypto: Crypto markets are heavily influenced by emotions – fear and greed. When prices dip, the ‘buy the dip’ mentality kicks in, fueled by the hope of quick gains as the market recovers. Contrarian Investing: Smart investors often look to go against the prevailing crowd sentiment. If everyone is bullish and ‘buying the dip,’ it might mean there are fewer buyers left to push prices higher, increasing the risk of a downturn. Santiment’s Observation: The current surge in ‘buy the dip’ mentions indicates widespread optimism, which, according to historical patterns and contrarian theory, could be a red flag. Think of it this way: when everyone is leaning to one side of the boat, there’s a higher chance it might tip over. In the crypto market, excessive bullishness can sometimes precede a price correction. Why ‘Buy the Dip’ Optimism Could Signal Further Downside for BTC Price Santiment’s report isn’t just based on a hunch. It’s grounded in the analysis of vast amounts of social data and market behavior. Here’s a breakdown of why this ‘buy the dip’ frenzy might be a cause for concern regarding BTC price : Overconfidence Breeds Complacency: When traders are overly confident in the ‘buy the dip’ strategy, it can lead to complacency. Investors might become less vigilant about risk management and potentially overextend themselves, making them vulnerable to market downturns. Exhaustion of Buying Power: A surge in ‘buy the dip’ activity suggests a large number of people are already deploying capital to purchase Bitcoin at lower prices. If this buying power gets exhausted, there might be less support to prevent further price drops. Market Manipulation: While not explicitly stated by Santiment, it’s worth considering that market manipulators can sometimes exploit widespread optimism. They might create temporary price dips to trigger ‘buy the dip’ reactions, only to then sell off larger holdings at slightly higher prices, profiting from the crowd’s enthusiasm. Historical Precedent: Analyzing past market cycles, periods of extreme ‘buy the dip’ optimism have sometimes coincided with local tops or further price corrections. History doesn’t always repeat itself, but it often rhymes, and understanding these patterns is crucial. Delving Deeper into On-Chain Metrics: Beyond the Surface Sentiment While social sentiment provides valuable insights, a comprehensive analysis requires looking at on-chain metrics . These metrics offer a more objective view of what’s happening within the Bitcoin network itself. Santiment and other on-chain analytics platforms track a wide range of data points, including: Exchange Flows: Monitoring the movement of Bitcoin to and from exchanges can indicate buying and selling pressure. Large inflows to exchanges might suggest selling intent, while outflows could signal accumulation. Active Addresses: The number of active Bitcoin addresses can reflect network usage and overall interest. A decline in active addresses during a ‘buy the dip’ phase might suggest waning enthusiasm beyond social media chatter. Transaction Volume: Analyzing transaction volume can provide insights into the level of economic activity on the Bitcoin network. Is the ‘buy the dip’ sentiment translating into actual transaction volume, or is it just online talk? Whale Activity: Tracking the behavior of large Bitcoin holders (whales) is crucial. Are whales also ‘buying the dip,’ or are they taking profits? Their actions can significantly influence market direction. By combining social sentiment analysis with on-chain metrics , analysts can paint a more complete and reliable picture of market dynamics and potential future price movements. It’s not just about what people are saying; it’s about what the data is actually showing. Navigating the ‘Buy the Dip’ Narrative: Actionable Insights for Traders So, what should you do with this information? Does Santiment’s report mean you should immediately sell all your Bitcoin? Not necessarily. However, it does suggest a need for caution and a more strategic approach to navigating the current market situation. Here are some actionable insights: Temper Your Enthusiasm: While ‘buy the dip’ can be a valid strategy, especially in long-term investing, it’s crucial to avoid getting caught up in excessive hype. Don’t let FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) drive your decisions. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Don’t rely solely on social sentiment or headlines. Dive deeper into on-chain data, technical analysis, and fundamental analysis to form your own informed opinion. Manage Your Risk: Implement robust risk management strategies. This includes setting stop-loss orders, diversifying your portfolio, and only investing what you can afford to lose. Look for Contrarian Signals: Pay attention to sentiment indicators like the ‘buy the dip’ mentions. When the crowd is overwhelmingly bullish or bearish, it might be time to consider the opposite perspective. Wait for Confirmation: A truly reliable bullish signal, according to Santiment, would be a decrease in optimism and fewer ‘buy the dip’ mentions. This would suggest that the market has bottomed out and that genuine buying interest is emerging from a place of less hype and more calculated accumulation. Table: Contrasting Market Sentiment Signals Sentiment Indicator Potential Market Signal Trading Strategy Surge in ‘Buy the Dip’ Mentions Potential for further downside; Overly bullish sentiment Exercise caution; Consider taking profits; Tighten stop-losses Decline in ‘Buy the Dip’ Mentions Potential bullish signal; Decreased optimism; Possible bottoming out Look for buying opportunities; Monitor for confirmation signals; Gradual accumulation Conclusion: Is the Bitcoin ‘Buy the Dip’ Narrative a False Hope? Santiment’s analysis serves as a valuable reminder that in the volatile world of crypto, widespread optimism isn’t always a positive sign. The current surge in ‘buy the dip’ mentions surrounding Bitcoin could indeed be a contrarian indicator, suggesting that further price corrections might be on the horizon. While ‘buying the dip’ is a common and sometimes profitable strategy, it’s crucial to approach it with prudence, critical thinking, and a deep understanding of market sentiment and on-chain metrics . By staying informed, managing risk, and being aware of contrarian signals, you can navigate the crypto markets more effectively and make more informed investment decisions. Remember, a truly strong bullish signal often emerges not from euphoria, but from a more measured and less hyped market environment.

40952709,https://coingape.com/?post_type=markets&p=241522,1740734874,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Ethereum (ETH) Price Flashes Death Cross After 25% Crash as MVRV Hits 2022 Levels,https://coingape.com/markets/ethereum-eth-price-death-cross-25-crash-mvrv-2022-levels/,"Ethereum (ETH) has shed 25% this week as it collapsed from a high of $2,930. The brutal sell-off has pushed ETH price to revisit the $2,000 psychological level. This downtrend is due to Bitcoin’s (BTC) nosedive that has pushed it below $80,000 for the first time since November 2024. The bearish sentiment and fears of a bear market are emphasized even more for Ethereum price due to the formation of Death Cross, a well-known sell signal. Additionally, investors who bought ETH a year ago are also facing huge losses, as noted by the MVRV indicator, which has dipped to 2022 levels. Let’s explore what this means for Ethereum price. ETH Price Collapses to $2,000 Amid Bitcoin’s Selling Spree Since February 21, Bitcoin has shed 20.55 %, and Ethereum has crashed 25% . As a result, the 50-day Moving Average (MA) has slid below the 200-day MA, forming the Death Cross. This sell signal shows that the short-term momentum is collapsing faster than the slow MA, suggesting a shift in outlook favoring bears. The 25% crash over the week has pushed ETH price to sweep equal lows at $2,100 , set up on January 1 and August 5, 2024, respectively. Since the $2,000 psychological level is just below where price currently trades, a potential recovery for Ethereum here wouldn’t be unlikely, especially if the market cools off. However, Bitcoin’s sell-off needs to stop for ETH to bounce off the $2,000 psychological level . ETH/USDT v. BTC/USDT 1-week, 1-day Chart ETH Holders Underwater as MVRV Hits 2022 Leves Santiment’s 365-day MVRV reads -32%, which shows the average profit/loss of investors who purchased ETH a year ago is at -32%. This level was seen at the depths of the 2022 bear market, showing that this ETH price crash has surprised many investors. ETH 365-day MVRV ETH Whales Buy As Retail Investors Panic Sell During times of intense market sell-off, retail investors tend to panic sell or fail to buy the dip. On the contrary, whales or institutional investors tend to be buyers during these times. Wallets holding 1,000 to 10,000 ETH accumulated roughly 120K Ether worth $240M since February 21, further highlighting this narrative. ETH Whales Holding 1K to 10K Accumulate as Price Crashes 25% What’s Next for ETH price? ETH price has had a bad reputation due to its lackluster performance in 2024, and to add to its woes, the power struggle happening at the Ethereum Foundation involving Vitalik Buterin and Aya Miyaguci. From a technical perspective, Ethereum recovery is unlikely until the crypto market cools off. Even if Bitcoin stops crashing, Ethereum price is unlikely to bounce back compared to some altcoins like Sonic (previously Fantom) due to the aforementioned events taking place at the Foundation. For now, the key support level to watch if $2,000 gives in is $1,632 . This barrier is where the most volume was traded between June 2022 and November 2023. On the other hand, if $2,000 holds, then the next key level is $3,000 . In addition to being at the psychological level, this level is where the Death Cross appears, a confluence of the 50-day and 100-day MA. Hence, $3,000 will be a tough resistance level to overcome.

They’re not just dipping their toes into the Bitcoin ocean; they’ve plunged in headfirst and are currently riding a massive wave of Bitcoin gains . Imagine holding a treasure chest overflowing with digital gold – that’s essentially what Strategy’s Bitcoin portfolio looks like right now. Let’s dive into the details of their impressive crypto journey and uncover what’s driving these staggering unrealized gains . Decoding Strategy’s Massive Unrealized Bitcoin Gains Strategy’s bold bet on Bitcoin has undeniably paid off – at least on paper. According to MSTR Tracker, a dedicated platform monitoring MicroStrategy’s (now Strategy) Bitcoin holdings, the company is sitting on a staggering $6.88 billion in unrealized gains . But what does ‘unrealized’ actually mean, and why is this such a big deal? Unrealized Gains Explained: Think of it like this: you buy a house for $100,000, and its market value jumps to $200,000. You haven’t sold the house, so you haven’t ‘realized’ the profit in cash yet. Similarly, Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings have appreciated significantly in value since their purchase, but they haven’t sold them to convert those gains into actual dollars. Hence, ‘unrealized.’ The Scale is Astounding: $6.88 billion is not pocket change. To put it in perspective, that’s more than the GDP of some small countries! This massive figure underscores the sheer scale of Strategy’s Bitcoin investment and the potential impact of cryptocurrency on corporate balance sheets. Average Purchase Price vs. Current Value: Strategy’s average purchase price for their Bitcoin is around $66,357 per BTC. With Bitcoin’s price fluctuating but generally trending upwards over time since their major accumulation phase, the difference between their purchase price and the current market value is what fuels these substantial Bitcoin gains . Delving into Strategy’s Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Strategy’s commitment to Bitcoin is nothing short of remarkable. They aren’t just dabbling; they’ve made Bitcoin a core part of their treasury reserve strategy. Let’s break down their corporate Bitcoin holdings : Quantity Matters: Strategy currently holds a whopping 499,096 BTC. To get a sense of this magnitude, consider that the total supply of Bitcoin is capped at 21 million. Owning nearly half a million Bitcoin positions Strategy as a major player in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Strategic Accumulation: Strategy hasn’t acquired all this Bitcoin at once. They’ve employed a strategy of continuous accumulation, often buying more Bitcoin during market dips. This dollar-cost averaging approach can be beneficial in volatile markets like cryptocurrency. Long-Term Vision: Michael Saylor, the former CEO and current Chairman of Strategy, has been a vocal Bitcoin bull. The company’s investment isn’t a short-term gamble; it reflects a long-term belief in Bitcoin as a store of value and a hedge against inflation. This long-term vision is central to their corporate Bitcoin holdings strategy. The MSTR Tracker: Your Window into Strategy’s Bitcoin Journey Want to keep a close eye on Strategy’s Bitcoin performance? That’s where the MSTR Tracker comes in handy. This invaluable tool provides real-time data and insights into their Bitcoin holdings. Here’s why the MSTR Tracker is essential for anyone following this corporate Bitcoin saga: Real-Time Data: The MSTR Tracker provides up-to-the-minute information on Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings, including the total amount of BTC held, the average purchase price, and the current value of their portfolio. This real-time data is crucial in the fast-paced world of crypto. Performance Monitoring: It allows you to track the performance of Strategy’s Bitcoin investment over time. You can see how their unrealized gains fluctuate with Bitcoin’s price movements, providing a clear picture of their investment’s success. Transparency and Insights: The MSTR Tracker promotes transparency in Strategy’s Bitcoin strategy. By making this data publicly accessible, it allows analysts, investors, and the crypto community to understand and analyze their Bitcoin investment strategy . Unpacking Strategy’s Bitcoin Investment Strategy: What Can We Learn? Strategy’s foray into Bitcoin isn’t just a random act; it’s a deliberate and well-articulated Bitcoin investment strategy . What are the key takeaways from their approach, and what can other companies (or even individual investors) learn from it? Embracing Volatility: Strategy’s strategy acknowledges Bitcoin’s inherent volatility but views it as an opportunity rather than a deterrent. They’ve shown a willingness to buy during dips, demonstrating a long-term perspective that can weather short-term price fluctuations. Treasury Diversification: For Strategy, Bitcoin serves as a diversification tool for their treasury reserves, moving away from traditional assets like cash. This highlights Bitcoin’s potential role in corporate finance beyond just a speculative asset. Public Advocacy: Michael Saylor’s public advocacy for Bitcoin has played a significant role in shaping the narrative around corporate Bitcoin adoption. His unwavering conviction has likely encouraged other companies to explore Bitcoin as a treasury asset. Risk Management Considerations: While the Bitcoin gains are impressive, it’s crucial to remember that investing in Bitcoin also carries risks. Strategy’s large holdings mean their balance sheet is significantly influenced by Bitcoin’s price. Risk management, therefore, is paramount in such a strategy. The Future of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings: Is Strategy Leading the Charge? Strategy’s bold move into Bitcoin has undoubtedly sparked conversations about the role of cryptocurrency in corporate finance. Are we on the cusp of a wave of corporate Bitcoin holdings ? While it’s still early days, Strategy’s example provides a compelling case study. Increased Corporate Interest: Strategy’s success story, highlighted by the MSTR Tracker and their substantial unrealized gains , is likely to pique the interest of other corporations seeking alternative treasury strategies. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment surrounding cryptocurrency is still evolving. Clarity and favorable regulations could further encourage corporate adoption of Bitcoin. Market Volatility as a Factor: Bitcoin’s volatility remains a key consideration for corporations. Companies considering following Strategy’s path will need to carefully assess their risk tolerance and develop robust risk management strategies. Conclusion: Strategy’s Bitcoin Bet – A Corporate Finance Revolution? Strategy’s $6.88 billion in unrealized Bitcoin gains is more than just a number; it’s a testament to their pioneering Bitcoin investment strategy and a potential glimpse into the future of corporate finance. By making Bitcoin a core part of their treasury, Strategy has not only potentially boosted their own financial position but has also paved the way for other companies to consider the transformative power of cryptocurrency. Whether this marks the beginning of a widespread corporate Bitcoin revolution remains to be seen, but Strategy’s journey, meticulously tracked by the MSTR Tracker , is undoubtedly a fascinating chapter in the ongoing crypto narrative. The sheer scale of their corporate Bitcoin holdings and the resulting Bitcoin gains are hard to ignore, making Strategy a company to watch closely in the evolving world of digital finance.

The U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF market just experienced a significant tremor. On February 27th, these ETFs collectively witnessed a staggering $266.31 million in net outflows. This marks the eighth consecutive day of net negative flow, raising eyebrows and sparking debates across the crypto community. Let’s delve into the details of this Bitcoin ETF Outflows event and understand what might be driving this trend. Decoding the Bitcoin ETF Outflows: A Detailed Look According to data shared by Trader T (@thepfund) on X, the outflows were widespread, but some ETFs felt the pinch more than others. BlackRock’s IBIT, often touted as a star performer, surprisingly led the pack with the largest outflows, totaling a substantial $192.32 million. WisdomTree’s BTCW followed with $53.78 million, and VanEck’s HODL saw $10.58 million leave its coffers. Here’s a breakdown of the outflows and inflows for a clearer picture: ETF Net Flow (USD Million) BlackRock (IBIT) -$192.32 WisdomTree (BTCW) -$53.78 VanEck (HODL) -$10.58 Grayscale (GBTC) -$7.26 Fidelity (FBTC) -$7.25 Franklin Templeton (EZBC) -$7.23 Grayscale Mini BTC -$5.54 Bitwise (BITB) +$17.65 Other ETFs No Significant Change As you can see, the majority of ETFs experienced outflows, but it’s crucial to note the contrasting performance of Bitwise’s BITB, which bucked the trend with a $17.65 million net inflow. This divergence highlights the nuanced dynamics within the crypto ETF market . Why are Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows Happening? The million-dollar question is: why are we witnessing these consistent spot Bitcoin ETF outflows? Several factors could be at play: Profit Taking: After a period of significant Bitcoin price appreciation, investors might be taking profits off the table. ETFs provide a convenient way to do this, leading to outflows. Market Correction Fears: The broader crypto market can be volatile. Concerns about a potential market correction might be prompting investors to reduce their exposure, including through ETF holdings. GBTC Outflows Continue: GBTC outflows have been a recurring theme since its conversion to an ETF. While the pace might fluctuate, continued withdrawals from GBTC, as seen with another $7.26 million outflow, contribute to the overall negative net flow. Rotation into Other Assets: Investors might be reallocating capital to other asset classes, including different cryptocurrencies or traditional investments, based on market conditions and portfolio strategies. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic uncertainties, interest rate hikes, or inflation concerns can influence investor sentiment and risk appetite, potentially impacting Bitcoin and related ETF investments. IBIT ETF Leading Outflows: A Cause for Concern? The fact that BlackRock’s IBIT ETF experienced the largest outflows is particularly noteworthy. IBIT had been consistently recording inflows and was considered a major driver of the initial Bitcoin ETF success. Is this a temporary blip, or does it signal a shift in investor sentiment towards even the most popular IBIT ETF ? It’s too early to definitively say, but here are a few possibilities: Normal Market Fluctuations: Even successful ETFs can experience periods of outflows. This could simply be a part of normal market dynamics. Large Investor Activity: A few large institutional investors deciding to rebalance their portfolios could significantly impact IBIT’s flow. Performance Concerns (Relative): While IBIT has performed well, investors might be seeking slightly different risk-reward profiles or exploring other ETF options. Bitwise BITB Inflow: A Silver Lining? Amidst the sea of red, Bitwise’s BITB ETF shone green with a $17.65 million inflow. This positive inflow suggests that not all investors are bearish on Bitcoin ETFs. What could be driving interest in BITB? Fund-Specific Appeal: BITB might have features, fee structures, or marketing strategies that are attracting investors even during a period of general outflow. Strategic Allocation: Some investors might be strategically allocating to BITB while reducing exposure to other ETFs based on their specific investment thesis. Value Proposition: Investors may perceive BITB as offering a compelling value proposition compared to its peers, leading to inflows even when the broader trend is negative. Navigating the Crypto ETF Market Volatility The recent Bitcoin ETF Outflows serve as a reminder of the inherent volatility in the cryptocurrency market, even within regulated investment products like ETFs. Investors should consider the following: Long-Term Perspective: Short-term outflows don’t necessarily negate the long-term potential of Bitcoin and crypto ETFs. Focus on your long-term investment goals and avoid knee-jerk reactions to daily market fluctuations. Diversification: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your investment portfolio across different asset classes and within the crypto space itself. Due Diligence: Understand the nuances of each ETF, including its holdings, fees, and tracking error. Choose ETFs that align with your investment strategy and risk tolerance. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, ETF flow data, and macroeconomic developments that can influence crypto markets. Conclusion: A Temporary Setback or a Warning Sign for Crypto ETFs? The $266.31 million net outflow from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on February 27th is undoubtedly a significant event. While eight consecutive days of outflows might sound alarming, it’s crucial to maintain perspective. The crypto ETF market is still relatively new, and fluctuations are expected. Whether this is a temporary setback or the beginning of a more sustained trend remains to be seen. For now, investors should closely monitor ETF flows, Bitcoin price action, and broader market sentiment to make informed decisions. The dynamic nature of the crypto space means surprises are always around the corner, and adaptability is key.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin is valued at $84,397, representing a 2.4% decline in the past 24 hours and a significant 13.7% drop over the past week. These market conditions have sparked a range of analyses, with various on-chain indicators offering insights into current investor behavior. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Demand Levels Return to Neutral Zone—What Next? Bitcoin Latest CDD Spike Could Signal A Market Shift One of the key indicators highlighted recently by a CryptoQuant analyst known as Banker is the Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric. According to Banker, the Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric—a measure of economic activity weighted by the age of coins being moved—has seen a substantial surge. The 60-day CDD indicator, which aggregates these destroyed coin days over two months, indicates that coins held for extended periods are now being spent at a much higher rate. This trend, observed from November 2024 to February 2025, suggests that long-term holders are increasingly active in the market, potentially signaling a pivotal moment for Bitcoin. Banker explains that elevated CDD values often correlate with significant market events. In this case, the sustained uptick in long-term holder activity may hint at profit-taking, asset reallocation, or anticipation of heightened market volatility. While it is not unusual for Bitcoin long-term holders to move coins during periods of major price shifts, the current trend represents the strongest CDD signal since 2021. Historically, such patterns have preceded market turning points, making this metric a critical one to watch. Why CDD Matters Notably, the Coin Days Destroyed metric differs from typical transaction volume as it gives more weight to coins that have remained untouched for longer periods. Each unspent day accumulates “coin days,” and when the holder finally moves those coins, these days are “destroyed.” The 60-day CDD effectively tracks long-term holder sentiment by revealing when these seasoned participants decide to act. As earlier mentioned, a consistent increase in CDD often reflects a growing willingness among long-term holders to take profits or reposition their portfolios—moves that can influence broader market sentiment.

With long-term holders moving their coins at a steady pace, the market could be heading toward a “healthier reset.” This kind of activity often sets the stage for new entrants to step in, potentially stabilizing the market and creating opportunities for fresh capital inflows. However, the implications depend heavily on the broader market context, including macroeconomic factors and investor confidence.

The incident, which unfolded in South Korea, underscores the growing intersection of digital assets and traditional criminal activities, raising critical questions about security and regulation within the crypto space. What Sparked the South Korea Crypto Robbery? According to reports from Newsis, the incident involved two Chinese nationals in their 30s who allegedly targeted a man under the guise of a cryptocurrency transaction. The suspects, now in custody and facing serious charges of aggravated robbery, reportedly lured the victim with the promise of a cryptocurrency purchase. However, their intentions were far from legitimate business dealings. Instead of engaging in a fair transaction, they resorted to violence, assaulting the man and making off with a substantial sum of cash. Here’s a breakdown of the key details of this alarming cryptocurrency crime: Location: Seoul, South Korea Suspects: Two Chinese men in their 30s Victim: Unidentified man persuaded to buy cryptocurrencies Crime: Aggravated robbery Amount Stolen: 30 million won, approximately $20,500 USD Current Status: Suspects arrested and in custody Cryptocurrency Crime on the Rise: A Global Concern This incident in South Korea is not an isolated event but rather a part of a worrying global trend. As cryptocurrencies gain mainstream adoption, they are also attracting unwanted attention from criminal elements. The anonymity and decentralized nature of many cryptocurrencies can, unfortunately, be exploited for illicit activities. From online scams and ransomware attacks to physical robberies like this one, cryptocurrency crime is becoming an increasingly complex challenge for law enforcement agencies worldwide. Several factors contribute to the rise of cryptocurrency crime : Anonymity: While not entirely anonymous, cryptocurrency transactions can be harder to trace compared to traditional banking systems, making them attractive for criminals. Decentralization: The lack of central authority in many cryptocurrencies means there’s no single point of regulation or control, which can be exploited. Growing Value: The increasing value of cryptocurrencies makes them a lucrative target for theft and fraud. Lack of Regulation: In many jurisdictions, cryptocurrency regulations are still evolving, creating loopholes that criminals can exploit. The Modus Operandi: How Did This Crypto Theft Unfold? In this particular case of crypto theft in South Korea, the suspects employed a tactic of persuasion, luring the victim with the promise of a cryptocurrency purchase. This suggests a level of premeditation and planning. It’s likely they used the allure of the crypto market to gain the victim’s trust before executing their criminal act. The fact that they stole cash, rather than cryptocurrency directly, could indicate several possibilities: They might have lacked the technical expertise to steal cryptocurrency directly. They might have preferred the immediate liquidity of cash. They might have believed stealing cash would be less traceable. Regardless of their specific motivations, the outcome was violent robbery, leaving the victim assaulted and financially harmed. South Korea Crypto Landscape: A Hotspot for Innovation and Crime? South Korea crypto market is one of the most vibrant and active in the world. The country has a high rate of cryptocurrency adoption and a tech-savvy population. This enthusiasm for digital assets, however, also makes it a potentially attractive target for criminals. The recent robbery highlights the need for increased vigilance and security measures within the South Korean crypto ecosystem and globally. Here are some aspects that make South Korea a significant player in the crypto world: Factor Description High Adoption Rate South Korea has one of the highest cryptocurrency adoption rates globally, with a significant portion of the population engaging in crypto trading. Tech-Savvy Population The country boasts a highly technologically advanced population, comfortable with digital technologies and online platforms. Active Trading Market South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges are among the busiest in the world, handling substantial trading volumes daily. Regulatory Scrutiny South Korean regulators have been actively working on establishing a framework for cryptocurrency regulation to balance innovation with consumer protection and crime prevention. Financial Crime and Cryptocurrency: What’s the Connection? The robbery in South Korea is a stark example of how cryptocurrency is becoming intertwined with traditional financial crime . While cryptocurrency technology itself is not inherently criminal, its features can be misused for illicit purposes. Law enforcement agencies are increasingly challenged to adapt their strategies to tackle these new forms of crime, which often cross international borders and operate in the digital realm. The connection between cryptocurrency and financial crime can be seen in various forms: Money Laundering: Cryptocurrencies can be used to obscure the origin of illegally obtained funds. Fraud and Scams: Crypto’s novelty and complexity make it a fertile ground for scams and fraudulent investment schemes. Theft and Robbery: As demonstrated in the South Korean case, physical and digital theft of cryptocurrencies and related assets is on the rise. Cybercrime: Cryptocurrencies are often used in ransomware attacks and other forms of cyber extortion. Actionable Insights: Staying Safe in the Crypto World This incident serves as a crucial reminder of the risks associated with cryptocurrency transactions, especially when dealing with unknown parties. While the promise of digital currencies is immense, users must exercise caution and prioritize security. Here are some actionable insights to stay safe in the crypto world and avoid becoming a victim of crypto robbery or similar crimes: Exercise Caution in Offline Transactions: Be extremely wary of meeting strangers in person for cryptocurrency transactions, especially if large sums of money are involved. Use Reputable Exchanges: Stick to well-known and regulated cryptocurrency exchanges for buying and selling digital assets. Secure Your Wallets: Use strong passwords, enable two-factor authentication, and consider using hardware wallets for enhanced security. Be Aware of Scams: Be skeptical of investment opportunities that seem too good to be true, and do thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency. Report Suspicious Activity: If you encounter any suspicious activity or become a victim of crypto crime, report it to the relevant authorities immediately. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call for Crypto Security The arrest of two suspects in South Korea for this crypto-related robbery is a positive step, but it also underscores the urgent need for enhanced security measures and greater awareness within the cryptocurrency community. As the digital asset landscape continues to evolve, so too must our strategies for protecting ourselves from criminal elements seeking to exploit this innovative technology. This incident is a fearful reminder that the crypto world, while full of potential, is not immune to the dangers of the real world.

This expiry event, larger than usual due to the month-end, is expected to have limited direct impact on the spot market, which is already under pressure from US President Donald Trump’s ongoing trade war . The put/call ratio for this options expiry stands at 0.71, indicating a higher number of call (long) contracts compared to puts (shorts). Data from Deribit shows that open interest remains highest at the $120,000 strike price, accounting for $1.5 billion in contracts. Additionally, the $100,000 and $110,000 strike prices have around $1 billion in open interest each, while bearish sentiment is increasing, with $800 million in contracts positioned at the $80,000 strike price—Bitcoin’s current level. Traders brace for further downside risk According to crypto derivatives provider Greeks Live, market sentiment remains predominantly bearish. “Overall Market Sentiment: The group is predominantly bearish with traders watching $82,000 as a critical support level that must hold to maintain the HTF (high timeframe) trend. There is significant concern about the continued downside, with many members discussing the rapid 17% decline over three days and debating whether recent selling is controlled or indicative of a broader market shift,” read the post. BTC was trading at $78,751 at 8:44 am GMT. Technical analysts warn that if the asset closes below the 2024 volume-weighted average price (VWAP) bands, the higher timeframe trend could be at risk, potentially pushing Bitcoin toward the $77,000–$72,000 range. Meanwhile, Ethereum is also facing a major expiry event, with 526,000 options contracts worth $1.14 billion expiring. The put/call ratio of 0.52 indicates relatively balanced positioning, though Ethereum has faced steeper losses than Bitcoin in recent sessions. What will happen to BTC and ETH prices? With Bitcoin facing heightened volatility, some traders are shifting toward call ratio spreads as a defensive strategy. This move is based on the expectation that, following the recent downturn, Bitcoin’s price action may become choppy, with a potential retest of $88,000 before a clearer direction emerges. Deribit reports that traders are preparing for further market turbulence, hedging against the risk of Bitcoin declining to levels last seen after election day. The broader outlook remains weak, exacerbated by US President Donald Trump’s tariffs on Mexico, Canada, China, and Europe . The long-term implications for Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency sector remain uncertain. Despite the current downturn, the max pain price for both Bitcoin and Ethereum remains significantly above their spot prices. With the max pain price exceeding the spot price, options sellers may have an incentive to push Bitcoin and Ethereum prices higher toward that level. “With the end of the month approaching, BTC options traders should take note: Max Pain for Feb 28 sits at $98,000, with a massive $5 billion notional value. This means the highest open interest is clustered here, incentivizing market makers to keep BTC close to this price. Expect increased volatility and potential price gravitation toward this level,” altcoin options exchange PowerTrade stated. Crypto market sell-off deepens The ongoing sell-off in the crypto markets has intensified, with total market capitalization dropping another 8.4% on Friday to $1.6 trillion, according to CoinGecko. The asset has now corrected more than 25% from its all-time high, dipping below $80,000 for the first time since November 10. Ethereum, meanwhile, saw an even steeper decline, falling 8% to $2,150, marking its lowest price in over a year with weekly losses of 22%. “Despite the dip, institutions like Standard Chartered remain optimistic, targeting $500K by the end of Trump’s term. Additionally, Texas’s unanimous approval of a Bitcoin Reserve shows strong government support for the sector. While these positive developments have boosted investor sentiment, it is yet to be reflected in Bitcoin’s price,” Saxena added. Other major cryptocurrencies also slid, with Ethereum down 7%, XRP losing 5%, BNB dropping 4%, and Solana slipping 3.9%. Dogecoin, Cardano, Chainlink, Tron, Sui, Avalanche, Stellar, Litecoin, and Hedera recorded losses between 2% and 8%.

One such crucial indicator is the Altcoin Season Index . Currently, this index, a key metric for gauging the prevailing sentiment in the crypto space, stands at 22. What does this number signify for your crypto portfolio, and are we truly in a Bitcoin Season ? Let’s dive deep to decode this. What is the Altcoin Season Index and How Does it Work? The Altcoin Season Index , meticulously tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), is not just another number; it’s a compass for navigating the crypto market’s ever-shifting tides. Think of it as a barometer, measuring the comparative strength of altcoins against Bitcoin. But how exactly does this index work its magic? Here’s a breakdown: Data Source: The index analyzes the top 100 cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens to provide a pure representation of market dynamics. Performance Window: It assesses the performance of these 100 coins over the past 90 days, offering a medium-term perspective on market trends rather than short-lived pumps and dumps. Bitcoin as the Benchmark: The core of the index lies in comparing altcoin performance against Bitcoin. Bitcoin, as the original and still dominant cryptocurrency, serves as the yardstick. The 75% Threshold: This is the magic number. For the market to be officially declared in ‘Altcoin Season’, at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins must have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. Index Range: The index score ranges from 1 to 100, providing a granular view of market sentiment. A higher score leans towards Altcoin Season, while a lower score indicates Bitcoin’s dominance. In essence, the Altcoin Season Index simplifies a complex market into a single, digestible metric, helping traders and investors understand whether the market is favoring Bitcoin or altcoins . Bitcoin Season vs. Altcoin Season: What’s the Difference? Understanding the difference between Bitcoin Season and Altcoin Season is crucial for strategic crypto investing. It’s not just about which coins are going up or down, but about broader market trends and capital flows. Feature Bitcoin Season Altcoin Season Market Dominance Bitcoin outperforms most altcoins. Capital tends to flow into Bitcoin, often seen as a ‘safer’ crypto asset. Altcoins outperform Bitcoin. Investors are more willing to take risks and explore higher-growth potential in altcoins. Altcoin Season Index Value Index value is low, typically below 25. The current index at 22 firmly places us in Bitcoin Season. Index value is high, ideally 75 or above. This indicates a broad-based altcoin rally. Investor Sentiment Risk-off sentiment. Investors prioritize safety and established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Risk-on sentiment. Investors are more adventurous, seeking higher returns in the diverse altcoin market. Market Action Bitcoin price may rise significantly, or at least hold its value better than altcoins. Altcoins may stagnate or decline in BTC terms. Many altcoins experience significant price surges, often outperforming Bitcoin by a considerable margin. Currently, with the Altcoin Season Index at 22, we are clearly in Bitcoin Season . This means that over the last 90 days, Bitcoin has generally outperformed the vast majority of altcoins in the top 100. Why is the Altcoin Season Index at 22? Decoding the Current Crypto Market The index reading of 22 isn’t just a random number; it’s a reflection of the current state of the crypto market . Several factors can contribute to a prevailing Bitcoin Season : Market Uncertainty: During times of economic or geopolitical uncertainty, investors often flock to Bitcoin as a perceived ‘safe haven’ within the crypto space. This increased demand drives up Bitcoin’s price relative to altcoins . Bitcoin Halving Cycles: Historically, Bitcoin halvings have been followed by periods of increased Bitcoin dominance. Anticipation or immediate aftermath of a halving can strengthen Bitcoin Season . Institutional Investment Flow: Large institutional investors often start by investing in Bitcoin before diversifying into altcoins . Initial institutional inflows predominantly benefit Bitcoin. Regulatory Landscape: Positive regulatory news for Bitcoin, or negative news impacting the broader crypto market (especially altcoins ), can strengthen Bitcoin’s position. Narrative and Media Attention: Mainstream media coverage often focuses on Bitcoin, especially during bull runs or market corrections. This attention can draw new investors primarily to Bitcoin. It’s important to remember that the crypto market is dynamic. A Bitcoin Season doesn’t last forever, and market conditions can shift rapidly. Understanding the underlying reasons for the current index reading helps in making informed investment decisions. Navigating Bitcoin Season: Strategies and Insights So, what should you do when the Altcoin Season Index points to Bitcoin Season ? Here are some actionable insights: Re-evaluate Your Portfolio: Consider if your portfolio is appropriately weighted for a Bitcoin Season . Are you overexposed to altcoins that might underperform Bitcoin in the current market? Focus on Bitcoin Fundamentals: During Bitcoin Season , it’s a good time to research and understand Bitcoin’s fundamentals, technological advancements, and adoption metrics. Identify Strong Altcoins: Not all altcoins are created equal. Even in a Bitcoin Season , some fundamentally strong altcoins with solid use cases and active development may hold their value or even outperform. Research and identify these gems. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) into Bitcoin: If you believe in the long-term potential of Bitcoin, Bitcoin Season can be an opportune time to DCA, accumulating more Bitcoin at potentially favorable prices compared to altcoins . Monitor the Index: Keep a close eye on the Altcoin Season Index . A rising index might signal a shift towards Altcoin Season, prompting you to adjust your strategy accordingly. However, it’s equally important to be aware of the challenges: Market Volatility: The crypto market is inherently volatile. Even during Bitcoin Season , sudden shifts can occur, impacting both Bitcoin and altcoins . False Signals: While the Altcoin Season Index is a valuable tool, it’s not foolproof. It’s just one indicator among many and should be used in conjunction with other analysis methods. Opportunity Cost: Focusing solely on Bitcoin during Bitcoin Season might mean missing out on potential gains in select altcoins that buck the trend. The Future of Altcoin Season Index and Crypto Market Dynamics The Altcoin Season Index provides a valuable snapshot of the current market sentiment, highlighting the ebb and flow between Bitcoin dominance and altcoin surges. As the crypto market matures, and new narratives emerge, understanding these cyclical patterns becomes even more critical for investors. Will the index remain at 22, solidifying Bitcoin Season further? Or will we see a shift towards altcoins in the near future? The answer lies in the evolving dynamics of the crypto market , influenced by technological advancements, regulatory developments, and global economic factors. Staying informed and adaptable is key to navigating this exciting, yet complex landscape. In conclusion, the Altcoin Season Index at 22 is a clear signal: we are currently in Bitcoin Season . This doesn’t mean altcoins are irrelevant, but it does suggest a period where Bitcoin is likely to lead the market. By understanding this indicator and adapting your strategies accordingly, you can navigate the crypto market with greater confidence and potentially optimize your portfolio for the prevailing conditions.

Meanwhile, a new Chainalysis report reveals that crypto crime hit a record $51 billion in illicit transactions in 2024, with criminals increasingly turning to stablecoins and AI-driven schemes to evade detection. THORChain Rocked by Resignations A THORChain developer announced their departure from the crypto protocol after a controversy over the blocking of transactions linked to North Korean hackers. The developer, known as “Pluto,” stated in a post on X that they will no longer be contributing to the project but would stay available for an orderly hand-off of responsibilities. This decision was made after the fallout from a vote to halt Ethereum transactions on THORChain in an attempt to stop the Lazarus Group from laundering stolen funds. THORChain validator “TCB” revealed that they were among three validators who supported the vote to prevent the group from using the protocol, but the decision was quickly overturned. According to THORSwap developer Oleg Petrov , three votes were required to stop transactions, while four were needed to reverse the halt. With the decision being reverted almost immediately, TCB warned that they will also step away from THORChain unless a solution was quickly implemented to stop the flow of illicit funds. The Lazarus Group has reportedly been using THORChain to launder some of the $1.5 billion that was stolen from the crypto exchange Bybit on Feb. 21. On Feb. 28, blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain reported that the group already moved $605 million worth of Ethereum through the protocol. The controversy comes at a time when THORChain is experiencing a surge in activity. In fact, it recorded its highest-ever daily volume of $860 million in swaps on Feb. 26, followed by $705 million the next day. Due to the mounting pressure after the Bybit hack, the FBI urged crypto validators and exchanges to take action against the Lazarus Group, which effectively confirmed that North Korea was responsible for the hack. TCB also warned that THORChain’s association with such large amounts of stolen funds could escalate the situation into a national security issue. However, THORChain’s founder, John-Paul Thorbjornsen , defended the protocol. He stated that none of the wallet addresses sanctioned by the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control interacted with THORChain, and pointed out that the hackers were simply moving funds too quickly for screening services to detect. Thorbjornsen argued that expecting blockchain protocols like THORChain to enforce censorship was unrealistic. He also pointed out that THORChain nodes operate under very strict rules and can be churned out if they fail to follow protocol guidelines. He downplayed concerns about regulatory intervention by stating that if a node operator feels uncomfortable, they can exit the network, allowing THORChain to adapt as needed. TCB, however, is a lot more skeptical about THORChain’s claims of decentralization, and argued that the protocol is not as resistant to regulatory attacks as Bitcoin due to its smaller validator base. They criticized the network’s design choices, which they claimed make it difficult to onboard new validators, resulting in a small group controlling infrastructure and transaction flows. According to TCB, many corporate actors that provide liquidity for THORChain are already censoring transactions on their front ends and are likely to move away from the protocol if it continues to allow illicit activity. Bybit Hack Shakes Institutional Confidence The recent billion-dollar cybersecurity breach at Bybit dealt a massive blow to institutional adoption of crypto staking, according to Bohdan Opryshko , the chief operating officer of staking services provider Everstake. The hack was carried out by North Korea’s Lazarus Group on Feb. 21, and resulted in the theft of approximately $1.4 billion worth of liquid staked Ethereum, making it the largest exploit in the industry’s history. (Source: Elliptic ) Opryshko stated that such high-profile security breaches discourage institutional investors from allocating funds to crypto assets, particularly staking-related investments. He pointed out that compliance and legal teams evaluating an Ether ETF will likely reconsider their plans after witnessing such a major security failure. The impact of the hack extends beyond investor hesitation, potentially accelerating the trend of stakers withdrawing their assets from centralized crypto exchanges. Over the past six months, the amount of staked Ether on centralized platforms fell from 8.6 million ETH in September to 8 million ETH in February, with a 0.5% decline occurring immediately after the Bybit hack. Many users are opting for non-custodial staking solutions or hardware wallets to enhance security. While Ether ETFs in the United States do not currently permit staking, the SEC recently acknowledged requests from issuers like 21Shares to allow a portion of their holdings to be staked. In Europe, Ether ETFs are already permitted to engage in staking, and analysts believe that US regulators may follow suit in the near future. Since their launch in July, Ether ETFs attracted close to $3 billion in net inflows, according to data from Farside Investors. However, they are still behind Bitcoin ETFs, which have been a key driver of institutional crypto adoption and attracted over $37 billion in net inflows since January of 2024. Ethereum ETF flow (Source: Farside Investors ) Staking itself is a fundamental aspect of the Ethereum blockchain that requires users to lock up their Ether as collateral with a validator in exchange for network rewards. While stakers earn ETH payouts through fees and rewards, they also face the risk of slashing, where part of their collateral is lost if the validator misbehaves. Other blockchain networks, like Solana, also incorporate staking mechanisms. Chainalysis Report Uncovers Record Crypto Crime Wave It seems like crypto crime reached a new level of sophistication, driven by AI-powered scams, stablecoin laundering, and highly efficient cyber syndicates, according to the 2025 “ Crypto Crime Report ” by Chainalysis. The report revealed a record-breaking $51 billion in illicit transaction volume over the past year, overturning initial estimates that suggested a decline in crypto crime. Advanced laundering techniques using stablecoins, decentralized finance, and artificial intelligence created the illusion of reduced illicit activity, while in reality, criminals adapted to evade detection. (Source: Chainalysis ) Traditional cybercrime methods have given way to professionalized fraud cartels, nation-state hackers, and AI-driven deception. While ransomware payments dropped 35% year-over-year, cybercriminals are increasingly shifting away from Bitcoin in favor of stablecoins, Monero, and DeFi exploits. The report revealed a major shift in the landscape, with stablecoins now accounting for 63% of all illicit crypto transactions. Their speed, liquidity, and ability to bypass regulatory oversight made them the preferred tool for laundering large sums of money while evading detection. (Source: Chainalysis ) Unlike Bitcoin, stablecoins offer near-instant transactions without the volatility, making them ideal for criminals who are looking to move funds undetected. In response, stablecoin issuers like Tether have taken action by freezing hundreds of addresses tied to illicit activity, pushing criminals toward alternative privacy-focused solutions like Monero and DeFi-based laundering schemes. As authorities and crypto firms work to counter these threats, the battle against financial crime in the digital space is only becoming more complex.",News|Security,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|EXCHANGE|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-28 09:35:27

However, technical indicators have turned bearish for the altcoin, suggesting a potential pullback is on the horizon. Morpho ( MORPHO ) soared to an intraday high of $2.44 on Friday, marking a 35% rise from its weekly low and bringing its market cap to nearly $500 million as of press time. The recent price rally was accompanied by a surge in trading activity, with daily trading volume doubling from the previous day to over $94 million. Founded in 2021, Morpho is a decentralized, noncustodial lending platform on Ethereum that optimizes lending pools by facilitating direct peer-to-peer interactions. The protocol, which enables overcollateralized lending and borrowing of crypto assets, aims to provide better interest rates for both borrowers and lenders by matching liquidity directly while still relying on traditional lending pools as a fallback when needed. You might also like: Bitcoin ETFs continue to face outflows as BTC dips below $80k Most of today’s gains came after Coinbase listed MORPHO on both the Ethereum and Base networks. As the largest crypto exchange in the U.S., Coinbase has a history of impacting crypto prices with its listings. As earlier reported by crypto.news, the so-called “Coinbase Effect” drove a nearly 30% surge in Popcat’s ( POPCAT ) price after its listing on the exchange. Meanwhile, Morpho’s developers also shared a few updates to go along with the Coinbase listing. The firm noted that their smart contracts are now live on multiple blockchains, including Unichain, Mode Network, Hemi, Corn and Sonic. These contracts have been reviewed by independent auditors and come with a $2.5 million bug bounty. Amid these developments, the hype among its community has pushed MORPHO to trend on Google. Potential correction on the horizon Despite the bullish listing announcement driving fresh interest in the altcoin, there remains a significant risk for MORPHO traders. According to data from IntoTheBlock, about 95% of MORPHO tokens are held by large investors. With over 87% of holders currently in profit, many might decide to sell and lock in gains, especially with the broader crypto market looking bearish. Bitcoin, the bellwether crypto asset, recently dropped below $80,000 , and the crypto fear and greed index hitting a two-year low could prompt a sell-off among risk assets like MORPHO. Technical indicators have also flashed bearish signals. On the 1-day MORPHO/USDT price chart, MORPHO remains under the 50-day moving average, suggesting that bears continue to dominate its market. MORPHO price, 50-day MA and Supertrend Chart — Feb. 28 | Source: crypto.news The Supertrend indicator supports the view as it was seen flashing red and remains above MORPHO’s price. Although MORPHO is still trading above the descending trendline that has been forming since Jan.17, a fall back below the trendline at $2 today could signal a bearish reversal as it marks a key psychological resistance level. In that case, MORPHO might drop further toward its local low of $1.75, last seen on Feb. 8. However, the setup could be invalidated if market sentiment improves and it rallies higher. At press time, MORPHO had already lost some of its daily gains, exchanging hands at $2.26 per coin.

With the SEC recently dropping cases against major crypto firms like Coinbase, Uniswap, and Robinhood, many wonder if Ripple could be next. Could the SEC End the Ripple Case? The SEC sued Ripple in December 2020, saying the company sold XRP as an unregistered security. However, Judge Analisa Torres ruled in 2023 that XRP itself is not a security, weakening the SEC’s case. Now, with increasing pressure on the SEC, people believe the agency might be ready to move on. At the recent SEC meeting, officials discussed legal matters and settlements. While the details are secret, many think the Ripple case may have been included. Former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel does not believe this is a sign of progress, but pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan is confident that Ripple has the upper hand. Political Pressure May Shake the Market Senator Cynthia Lummis recently criticized the SEC’s approach to crypto regulation, stating that most digital assets are not securities under the Howey Test. Meanwhile, this aligns with Judge Torres’ ruling in the Ripple case, further strengthening Ripple’s position. No official decision has been announced yet, but the next key date is April 16 , when Ripple must submit its reply to the SEC’s appeal. If the SEC withdraws before then, it could mark the end of the long-running case, paving the way for a brighter future for XRP. What Next For XRP? As of now, XRP’s price is trading around $2.03 reflecting a drop of 8.19% with a market cap hitting $142 billion. However, many crypto experts believe that if the SEC drops the case, XRP could rise sharply. Some even predict a jump toward $3.20.

According to a February 27 staff statement from the commission’s Division of Corporation Finance, meme coins may not qualify as securities because they don’t meet the Howey test , a legal standard introduced by the Supreme Court in 1946 to determine whether a transaction counts as an investment contract under US securities laws. The SEC wants to provide “greater clarity on the application of the federal securities laws to crypto assets” by clarifying its stance. Meme coins are like ‘collectables’ Rationalising its views, the regulator said meme coins lack the key elements of a security , particularly an investment in a common enterprise where profits come from the “entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.” Instead, the commission views meme coins as driven by “market demand and speculation,” with their value tied to hype rather than structured business growth. Unlike traditional investments, they don’t grant holders financial rights, such as ownership stakes or dividends. An excerpt from the SEC’s statement reads: Although individual meme coins may have unique features, meme coins typically share certain characteristics. Meme coins typically are purchased for entertainment, social interaction, and cultural purposes, and their value is driven primarily by market demand and speculation. Further, the SEC noted that meme coins don’t fit within “any of the common financial instruments specifically enumerated in the definition of ‘security,’” such as stocks or bonds. Unlike traditional investments, they don’t generate yield or provide rights to “future income, profits, or assets of a business.” Since their trading activity doesn’t involve an investment in an enterprise, nor do buyers have a “reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others,” the SEC stated that meme coins fail to meet the Howey test’s criteria for an investment contract and concluded that “a meme coin is not itself a security.” The statement continued: Persons who participate in the offer and sale of meme coins do not need to register their transactions with the Commission under the Securities Act of 1933 or fall within one of the Securities Act’s exemptions from registration. Accordingly, neither meme coin purchasers nor holders are protected by the federal securities laws. However, the commission warned that its stance doesn’t cover all tokens labelled as meme coins. Any project disguising itself as a meme coin while functioning as a security could still face scrutiny. The SEC also said that its views aren’t a “rule, regulation, guidance, or statement” of the commission itself and emphasized that the statement carries “no legal force or effect.” Instead, the regulator wants to provide “greater clarity on the application of the federal securities laws to crypto assets” by clarifying its stance. Meme coins become a heated topic With tokens like Official Trump (TRUMP), launched by US President Donald Trump and Melania Meme (MELANIA), crashing noticeably from their all-time high prices, concerns have been raised over the unregulated nature of the market. As previously reported by Invezz , on the same day, House Democrats introduced the Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement (MEME) Act, which seeks to block public officials and their kin from issuing, endorsing, or profiting from cryptocurrencies.

Donald Trump’s Tariff Shock Trigger Crypto Sell-off appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is facing a brutal correction, wiping out all gains since Donald Trump’s election win in November . The overall market capitalization has dropped 8% to $2.7 trillion, with Bitcoin crashing 7% to $78,000—its lowest since November. The selling pressure intensified after Trump announced fresh tariffs on Chinese imports, sparking fears of a global economic slowdown. According to The Kobeissi Letter, since the trade war fears began on January 20th, the crypto market has lost $800 billion, wiping out gains despite Trump being the most pro-crypto president in history.

Meme coins, including Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Pepe (PEPE), face steep declines as the SEC’s recent statement cast doubt on their utility and increase investor caution. XRP Struggles to Float Above $2 The cryptocurrency market’s collapse has escalated in the past 24 hours, with countless digital assets plunging by double digits. Ripple’s XRP is among the biggest losers, tanking by 10% on a daily scale. It traded slightly above $2 over the past several hours before tanking below that psychological level (according to CoinGecko’s data). XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko While some industry participants believe the bull cycle might be over, some factors suggest that a resurgence is not out of the question. One element that could bring back the green candles is the eventual resolution of the lawsuit between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The case remains ongoing for more than four years after its start, but some important developments signal that its outcome could be just around the corner. For instance, the regulator has recently suspended lawsuits against some crypto entities, including Coinbase , Uniswap , and others. This has caused speculation that the legal battle against Ripple might be the next to be dismissed . Some experts , though, have argued that the complexity of the case might be a hurdle. The popular US lawyer Jeremy Hogan said : “The SEC broke up with Coinbase after a couple of dates. Ripple and the SEC live together and have a baby.” He thinks dismissing the lawsuit against the company is unlikely, forecasting a settlement instead. PI’s First Trading Days Contrary to the bearish environment in the crypto market in the last several days, the native token of Pi Network has charted impressive gains. It has surged by over 250% on a weekly scale , reaching an all-time high of almost $3 on February 27 and currently trading at roughly $2.13. PI Price, Source: CoinGecko Some market observers believe PI’s rally has yet to reach its full potential. They based the prediction on the assumption that Binance is about to list the token on its platform. Not long ago, the biggest crypto exchange held a community vote to determine whether its users would want to see PI available for trading. The results became official on February 27 , with over 86% of the voters clicking the “yes” option. The Memes Bleed Heavily Last but not least , we will touch upon the meme coin niche, which is also deeply covered in red. Leading tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE), and Official Trump (TRUMP) have collapsed by double digits in the past 24 hours alongside the overall market slump. The poor performance comes shortly after the SEC classified most meme coins as non-securities. At the same time, the agency claimed that these tokens “typically have limited or no use or functionality,” warning investors that they sit at the furthest end of the risk spectrum.

This altcoin, priced at just $0.20, has already raised over $44.3 million in its presale phase. With strong investor confidence and a unique asset tokenization model, Rexas Finance is set to challenge established cryptocurrencies. Tokenizing real estate: A revolutionary approach Through Rexas Finance , real estate assets can be tokenized to enhance their general marketability and ease their transmission and purchase. Blockchain has the potential to address inefficiencies within the worldwide real estate market, which holds a value of above $326 trillion. The technology leads to higher marketplace transparency,y which shortens dealing durations while enabling investors from around the world to participate. Institutional financial investors begin to prefer blockchain-based real estate investments because they guarantee security alongside efficiency. Through tokenization, investors now have the ability to own fractions of properties because it decreases barriers that limit investors from securing large-scale assets. Real estate transactions facilitated by Rexas Finance provide clients with blockchain-powered transactions that are efficient as well as cost-effective and fully documented on the blockchain. Rexas Finance expands its tokenization operations into three main financial sectors: real estate, stocks and bonds, and commodities. Blockchain adoption finds major potential in markets with a value in excess of $486 trillion. Rexas Finance functions to unite traditional financial procedures with decentralized solutions. The RXS token and presale success The RXS token serves as the foundation of the Rexas Finance ecosystem, offering utility in asset tokenization and DeFi applications. Priced at $0.20 during the presale, the project sold over 441.7 million tokens. This strong demand signals investor confidence and positions RXS for substantial post-launch growth. Token holders benefit from access to exclusive investment opportunities and DeFi services on the Rexas Finance platform. The project’s strategic tokenomics, with a capped supply of 1 billion tokens, ensure scarcity and long-term value appreciation. Analysts predict significant price movement as the token approaches its official exchange listing. Rexas Finance has set its exchange debut for June 19, 2025, with an initial listing price of $0.25. This launch has fueled speculation that RXS could experience exponential growth, similar to early Ethereum trends. Some projections estimate a potential surge to $6.00 or higher in the months following its listing. Rexas Finance launchpad and cross-chain interoperability Rexas Launchpad simplifies fundraising activities and asset tokenization procedures for its users in a single accessible platform. Through Rexas Launchpad, users can achieve faultless cross-chain processes which implement blockchain standards like ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155. Rexas Finance benefits from superior versatility because it supports multiple blockchain standards at once. The Rexas Token Builder provides users with an easy solution for tokenizing assets through its user-friendly interface, which requires minimal blockchain knowledge. Because of its barrier-free setup, the platform welcomes users, including institutional investors and small businesses. Rexas Finance’s system’s accessibility enables the company to solidify its standing as a leading asset tokenization platform in the market. Rexas Finance’s blockchain-powered approach distinguishes itself by resolving genuine financial problems in the market. This platform benefits from implementing asset tokenization alongside DeFi features and cross-chain protocols because it exhibits development potential that mirrors Ethereum’s during its initial growth phase.

AMP price analysis gives a highly bearish prediction of the market trends. The coin value decreased to a $0.00433 level in the last 24 hours. It lost 7.51 percent over the day. The decrease made the market unstable, as the selling pressure is overwhelming. Technical indicators give out a sell signal, and the price charts also depict an unbalanced trading environment. Is AMP a good investment? AMP has been struggling with a bearish trend for the past few months. Despite this, its strong fundamentals suggest it could be a solid long-term investment. Crypto analysts suggest that the approaching weeks can steadily increase the cryptocurrency’s value. A bullish rally may be expected in the latter part of this year (2025), potentially pushing the AMP above $0.0121. Why is AMP down? AMP’s price has decreased today. Additionally, the coin has experienced a substantial loss of 7.51% if observed over the last 24 hours. The price is trading at $0.00433 which is in the average range, moreover, the bears remained on the lead in the past few days. Will AMP reach $0.010? AMP’s resistance level is at $0.008, yet a break above this level is possible if sufficient buying momentum builds. A break near or above $0.010 will require a more robust push but isn’t impossible, as the coin achieved this level on December 3, 2024. What will AMP price target be in 2025? The highest price target for AMP in 2025 is $0.0121. Will AMP ever reach $1? Amp has never spiked above the $0.12 level. Even this price mark was observed only once at the start of the token’s launch, and AMP has never seen this level again. It seems highly unlikely for AMP to achieve $1 soon. Will AMP reach $10? According to the price prediction, AMP will not achieve this level in the next 10 years until something unusual happens. Considering AMP’s current market cap of only $5.7 million, the scenario seems almost impossible. What will AMP be worth in 2030? The highest price of AMP in 2030 is expected to be around $0.00458. Does AMP have a good long-term Future? Amp is trading near its average price level if observed over the longest price period levels. It can be a good long-term investment, as its price is expected to double in 2025 and reach $0.0526 by 2031.

A recent community vote on the exchange saw overwhelming support for the listing, further fueling optimism. Despite a 20% dip in Pi Coin’s price amid a broader crypto market downturn, enthusiasts remain bullish on its long-term growth. Could a Binance listing happen this week? Pi Network Gains Massive Support in Binance Vote Binance recently concluded a community vote on whether to list Pi on its platform. The voting window, which ran from February 17 to February 27, allowed users to express their stance on the matter. The leading exchange engaged the crypto community by stating: “We have been listening to the vibrant discussions within our community about Pi Network. To ensure your voices are heard, participate in our Community Vote on the topic: Should PI be launched on Binance?” The results were decisive. A staggering 86% of the total 294,958 votes supported the listing, while only 14% opposed it. The overwhelming majority has fueled speculations that Binance may soon take action on the matter. If approved, this move could significantly enhance Pi Coin’s credibility and price potential. What’s Next For Pi Network After Binance Vote? While the voting results are positive, Binance has yet to confirm an official listing. Typically, community votes influence decisions but do not guarantee immediate action. Binance follows a thorough due diligence process, evaluating the project’s security, liquidity, and compliance with regulatory frameworks before making a final decision. The Pi team must also ensure that its mainnet operations align with Binance’s listing criteria. The project, which recently launched its mainnet, is still working on key developments. A listing on Binance could push Pi Coin towards wider adoption, but the final decision remains in the hands of the exchange. Why Is This Listing Important? A Binance listing could be a game-changer for Pi Coin. It would expose the token to a global audience, enhancing liquidity and price stability. Historically, top crypto exchange listings have triggered price surges for various cryptocurrencies. If Pi Network secures a spot on Binance, it could see an influx of new investors, potentially driving up its valuation. However, market conditions also play a crucial role. With Pi Coin’s value facing a significant drop today amid a broader crypto market correction , a listing alone may not be enough to reverse its short-term losses. Still, long-term investors view this potential milestone as a catalyst for sustained growth. What’s Next For Pi Coin Price? Pi Coin value today was down nearly 20% and exchanged hands at $2.15 while its one-day trading volume fell 53% to $1.68 billion. However, despite today’s dip, the crypto has added about 230% since last week. Besides, it has also touched its ATH of $2.99 recently, indicating growing market confidence. Having said that, it appears that the recent surge might have caused the current dip in Pi Network’s value. For context, some investors might take the recent surge as an opportunity to book profits. However, despite that, market enthusiasts remain optimistic about the long-term trajectory of the coin. For context, market watcher Max Pavlov recently said that the crypto is likely to target its upper resistance at $3.50 if the bullish momentum holds. But, if the bears dominate, the crypto might slip to $2.05, Pavlov noted. Despite that, with soaring rumors of Binance listing soon, the crypto might see a strong recovery soon. Notably, a recent Pi price analysis hints at a potential rally for the crypto to $5 after the Binance listing.

40957035,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=135368,1740742407,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Upbit’s Bold Stand: Dunamu Defies South Korea’s Crypto Regulations in FIU Lawsuit,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/upbit-dunamu-fiu-lawsuit/,"In a dramatic escalation of tensions between the cryptocurrency industry and regulatory bodies in South Korea, Dunamu, the operator of the popular Upbit crypto exchange, has launched a legal challenge against the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). This move signals a significant pushback against recent regulatory actions and raises critical questions about the future of crypto operations in the nation. Are we witnessing a crucial battle that could reshape the landscape of South Korea crypto regulations ? Why is Dunamu Challenging the FIU? Understanding the Upbit Lawsuit Dunamu’s lawsuit, filed on February 27th with the Seoul Administrative Court, is a direct response to a three-month partial suspension slapped on Upbit by the FIU. But what exactly triggered this drastic action? Let’s break down the key elements of this Upbit lawsuit : The Suspension: The FIU imposed a three-month suspension on specific Upbit operations. While the exact details of these operations haven’t been fully disclosed, it’s understood to impact certain aspects of user transactions, particularly concerning new user crypto transfers. Grounds for Suspension: The FIU cited non-compliance issues as the reason for the suspension. While the specifics remain unclear, it suggests that Upbit may have fallen short of certain regulatory standards set by the Financial Intelligence Unit , potentially related to anti-money laundering (AML) or know-your-customer (KYC) procedures. Dunamu’s Rebuttal: Dunamu is vehemently contesting the suspension, arguing that it is unjust and potentially damaging to their operations and users. The lawsuit seeks two primary outcomes: to overturn the suspension order completely and to secure an immediate halt to its execution while the legal proceedings are underway. Accountability Measures: Adding fuel to the fire, the FIU also held nine Upbit employees accountable, including the CEO. He received a formal reprimand and was removed from his compliance officer role. This demonstrates the FIU’s serious stance and intent to enforce regulatory compliance rigorously. This legal challenge is not just about Upbit; it’s a broader statement about the relationship between crypto exchanges and regulators in South Korea. It highlights the growing pains of a rapidly evolving industry grappling with establishing clear and fair regulatory frameworks. Delving Deeper: The Core Issues in the Dunamu FIU Conflict The heart of the matter lies in the interpretation and enforcement of South Korea crypto regulations . The conflict between Dunamu FIU can be viewed through several critical lenses: Regulatory Clarity vs. Ambiguity: Are the current crypto regulations in South Korea sufficiently clear and unambiguous for exchanges to operate without constant fear of penalties? Exchanges may argue that the rules are often vaguely defined or subject to shifting interpretations, making full compliance a moving target. Regulators, on the other hand, prioritize a cautious approach to protect consumers and the financial system, which can sometimes lead to stringent and perhaps seemingly opaque guidelines. Fairness and Proportionality: Is the three-month suspension a proportionate response to the alleged non-compliance issues? Dunamu likely believes the penalty is excessive and disproportionately impacts their business and users. The FIU, however, probably views the suspension as a necessary measure to deter non-compliance and maintain the integrity of the financial system. Innovation vs. Control: This situation reflects the inherent tension between fostering innovation in the burgeoning crypto space and maintaining regulatory control. Overly strict regulations can stifle innovation and push businesses away, while lax regulations can expose the market to risks. Finding the right balance is the key challenge. Precedent Setting: The outcome of this Upbit lawsuit could set a significant precedent for future regulatory actions and legal challenges in the South Korean crypto market. A win for Dunamu might embolden other exchanges to challenge regulatory decisions, while a loss could strengthen the FIU’s hand and lead to stricter enforcement. What Does This Mean for Upbit Users and the Broader Crypto Market? The crypto exchange suspension imposed on Upbit, and the subsequent lawsuit, have implications that ripple through the entire crypto ecosystem: User Concerns: Upbit users might be concerned about the security and stability of the exchange during this period of uncertainty. While Upbit is challenging the suspension, the situation could create anxiety and potentially impact user confidence. It’s crucial for Upbit to communicate transparently with its users and assure them of continued service within the allowed operational scope. Market Volatility: News of regulatory actions and legal battles can often trigger market volatility in the crypto space. Traders and investors should be prepared for potential fluctuations in the prices of cryptocurrencies, especially those closely associated with Upbit or the South Korean market. Industry-Wide Impact: The outcome of this case will be closely watched by other crypto exchanges in South Korea and globally. It could influence how regulators in other jurisdictions approach crypto regulation and enforcement. A strong regulatory stance in South Korea could signal a global trend towards tighter controls. Long-Term Regulatory Landscape: This legal battle is a crucial step in shaping the long-term regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in South Korea. It underscores the need for ongoing dialogue and collaboration between regulators and industry players to create a framework that fosters innovation while mitigating risks. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Evolving Regulatory Waters For crypto investors, businesses, and enthusiasts, the Dunamu FIU saga offers valuable lessons and actionable insights: Stakeholder Actionable Insight Crypto Investors Stay informed about regulatory developments and their potential impact on your investments. Diversify your holdings across different exchanges and jurisdictions to mitigate risks associated with regulatory actions in a single region. Consider using exchanges with a strong track record of regulatory compliance. Crypto Exchanges Prioritize proactive and robust compliance measures. Engage in open communication with regulators and seek clarity on evolving regulations. Be prepared to adapt your operations to meet regulatory requirements and build trust with both regulators and users. Regulators Strive for clear, consistent, and proportionate regulations that balance innovation and risk mitigation.

40957258,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/02/dogecoin-price-prediction-will-this-competitor-take-doges-crown,1740742786,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/40957258.jpeg,Dogecoin Price Prediction: Will This Competitor Take Doge’s Crown?,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/02/dogecoin-price-prediction-will-this-competitor-take-doges-crown,"Dogecoin Price Prediction is on the minds of many, but here’s the twist: while Dogecoin has had its time in the spotlight, a new contender is rising fast, Dawgz AI. Personally, I’ve seen how $DAGZ has been outperforming expectations with its AI-powered trading bots, offering insane returns for investors. Whether you’re looking for a triple-double ROI or simply want to fund Ethereum's booming ecosystem, Dawgz AI is the smarter, more profitable choice right now. So, could Dawgz AI steal Doge’s crown? With its innovative technology and rapid growth, it’s certainly making waves. Dawgz AI vs. Dogecoin: A Battle for the Crown When it comes to meme coins, Dogecoin has led the pack. It has a huge fan base and has garnered attention from investors and celebrities alike. However, despite all of its popularity, the Dogecoin doge price prediction has been somewhat volatile and lacking in real utility. This is where $DAGZ comes into play. Dawgz AI isn’t just about fun, it’s about profitability. With its AI-powered trading bots running 24/7, it takes advantage of the market's ups and downs to maximize returns. Unlike Dogecoin, which relies mainly on community support and social media hype, Dawgz AI offers a solid foundation for growth through technology, smart trading, and rewards. The Power of AI-Powered Trading: Dawgz AI’s Secret Weapon One of the most exciting characteristics of Dawgz AI is its AI-driven trading bots. The bots work around the clock, executing trades automatically to take advantage of market fluctuations. This means you don’t have to manually track the market capitalization or rely on price prediction based on technical analysis alone. Unlike Dogecoin, whose peak price prediction relies on market sentiment and social trends, $DAGZ uses AI to make data-driven decisions that can lead to better, more consistent returns. Imagine not needing to check the current Dogecoin price every few hours because you know your investments are being handled efficiently 24/7. Here’s how it works: AI-powered trading bots analyze real-time data. They make quick trades, capitalizing on even the smallest market movements. This system is built to adapt, ensuring you can keep up with the fast-paced crypto marketplace. While Dogecoin has certainly made a name for itself, its average price action is often subject to celebrity tweets and memes. Dawgz AI, on the other hand, is driven by cutting-edge technology that aims for long-term gains rather than short-term hype. Staking Rewards: Earning While You Hold One thing Dawgz AI offers that Dogecoin doesn't is the ability to earn staking rewards. If you hold Ethereum (ETH), Dawgz AI allows you to stake your tokens and earn passive income with competitive APY. This feature alone can make a significant difference for investors who want to increase their holdings while waiting for dogecoin doge prices to rise. Here’s how staking rewards work: Staking allows you to earn rewards by holding tokens in a secure wallet. The higher your staked amount, the better your rewards. It’s a way to make your crypto work for you, while other coins, like Dogecoin, don’t offer similar passive income opportunities. In the case of Dawgz AI , this is just another way to capitalize on its growing momentum without having to rely solely on Dogecoin DOGE price to increase. Dawgz AI’s Presale Momentum: The Road to Growth Another standout feature of Dawgz AI is its presale momentum. Already raising over $2 million, $DAGZ is set for massive growth with its next milestone target of $2.1 million. As more people get on board, there’s an expected increase in the highest price prediction for Dawgz AI. This presale success is a clear sign that Dawgz AI is growing in popularity and attracting investors. Unlike Dogecoin, which started as a meme with little initial backing, Dawgz AI has already shown its strength in the market with over $2 million raised in presale funding. As more investors hop on board, the demand for Dawgz AI is only expected to rise, pushing its market capitalization up and driving Dogecoin prices to increase. https://www.youtube.com/embed/acaQLeIKyyA?si=-1Yb34MxKB4DBJPX "" title=""YouTube video player"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"" referrerpolicy=""strict-origin-when-cross-origin"" allowfullscreen> Strong Tokenomics: A Sustainable and Profitable Future When it comes to cryptocurrency, tokenomics is key to understanding long-term sustainability. With a total stock of 8.888 billion coins, Dawgz AI has a well-planned distribution to ensure stability. Here’s how it breaks down: 30% goes to the presale, allowing early investors to benefit. 20% is reserved for staking rewards, encouraging users to hold and stake their tokens. 10% is allocated to liquidity, ensuring smooth market operations. This structured tokenomics is crucial for maintaining a solid market cap and supporting the long-term success of Dawgz AI. Compared to Dogecoin, which has an unlimited supply and fluctuating demand, Dawgz AI has carefully planned its distribution to ensure its average price remains stable and valuable. In contrast, Dogecoin’s price has faced challenges with its massive supply, leading to inflation and wild minimum price swings. Dawgz AI’s focused approach to tokenomics gives it a much more sustainable growth trajectory. Meme Coin with Utility: The Best of Both Worlds It’s no secret that Dogecoin started as a joke, and while it has grown significantly, it’s still primarily a meme coin without much underlying utility. On the other hand, Dawgz AI combines the fun of meme coins with the utility of advanced AI-powered trading. By offering real AI-driven trading and staking rewards, Dawgz AI adds tangible value to its holders. Unlike Dogecoin, which primarily benefits from social media hype and investor sentiment, Dawgz AI gives its users something more substantial: a way to earn passive income while enjoying the fun of meme coin culture. This combination of fun and profitability makes Dawgz AI the more attractive investment for those who want to benefit from the meme coin trend while still gaining real-world value. Conclusion Looking at the Dogecoin price prediction 2025, it’s clear that Dawgz Ai has the potential to give Dogecoin a serious challenge. While Dogecoin continues to be a favorite in the meme coin world, its reliance on social sentiment and limited utility might leave it vulnerable to competitors like Dawgz AI. With Dawgz AI ’s focus on long-term sustainability, cutting-edge technology, and tangible rewards. It’s well-positioned to potentially take Dogecoin’s crown and offer investors a more profitable alternative in the ever-evolving world of meme coins. Dawgz AI could be the one to watch as we look ahead to the future of Dogecoin DOGE and its competitors. Frequently Asked Questions What is the Dogecoin prediction for 2025? The Dogecoin forecast for 2025 remains uncertain, with many market analysts predicting moderate maximum price increases. However, Dawgz AI stands as a more promising investment for 2025. Unlike Doge price prediction, driven by social media and hype, Dawgz AI has strong tokenomics and AI-powered trading, giving it the potential to consistently outperform dogecoin DOGE price over the long term. Can DOGE reach $10? Reaching $10 seems unlikely based on DOGE price prediction history and its minimum price action. Many people think that the Dogecoin price prediction 2030 with reach $10, but not the Dogecoin 2025 price prediction. The maximum value for Dogecoin would require massive market shifts and sustained adoption. Dawgz AI, on the other hand, has a much more achievable roadmap, focusing on AI-driven growth, staking rewards, and presale momentum, positioning it for exponential growth in a way Dogecoin cannot. How much is $500 worth of Dogecoin right now? The current price of Dogecoin fluctuates, but with $500, you can get a significant amount based on the current DOGE price. The price prediction for dogecoin of $500 is a great amount, but the Dogecoin price prediction 5 years can be a smaller amount. However, Dawgz AI offers more potential with its AI-powered trading bots and staking rewards, turning your investments into passive income while Dogecoin's price struggles to maintain a stable increase. Is Dogecoin projected to skyrocket? While there may be short-term price increases in DOGE price forecast, it's unlikely to experience a sustained skyrocket in minimum and maximum prices. Dawgz AI is a more strategic investment, leveraging AI-driven trading volume, staking, and strong tokenomics to provide more consistent returns. It’s a smarter choice if you’re looking for long-term gains rather than the unpredictable lowest price motion of Dogecoin.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) continues to remain one of the best picks because of its momentum driven by the community. Still, three other coins could be just as profitable: Rexas Finance (RXS), Cardano (ADA), and Dogecoin (DOGE). RXS is revolutionizing asset tokenization, ADA continues its development in blockchain scalability, and DOGE thrives on strong adoption. By strategically holding these coins, investors can maximize their returns during the upcoming market surge. Rexas Finance (RXS): A High-Growth Asset for the 2025 Bull Run Certain investors stay on standby and exercise caution to see how the market develops since a crypto bull run appears soon. Following Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) path, which leads in the meme coin sector, Rexas Finance (RXS) is gaining fame due to its real-world asset tokenization. Rexas Finance is currently undergoing the last phase of its token presale, and approximately 90% of the tokens have been purchased. The presale has successfully raised over $45.89 million. The estimated time for the token to go public is June 19th, 2025, at an initial value of $0.25 per token. Rexas Finance could benefit from strong post-listing demand. Unlike SHIB, which depends on speculative hype, RXS has garnered support from an extensive utility-diversified ecosystem enabling fractional real estate ownership, art, commodities, and more. Why Hold RXS for the Next 7 Months? Presale-to-Launch Growth: With a presale price of $0.20, RXS is expected to be valued at $0.25 at launch, with additional upside potential as more investors recognize its value. Real-World Use Cases: Unlike SHIB, which is largely transactional, RXS provides investment access to high-value assets through blockchain-based tokenization. Yield and Passive Income Opportunities: Investors can stake RXS tokens, which gives them passive income while having more reasons to hold the investment long-term. Market Outlook: Rexas Finance appeals to investors looking for real investments, while Shiba Inu intrigues speculative traders. With the upcoming launch and strong presale activity, Rexas Finance is positioned for long-term growth. Thus, RXS should be held alongside SHIB and other leading cryptocurrencies. Shiba Inu(SHIB) Whales Signal Imminent Rally There has been a massive transfer worth over $26 million of Shibu Inu (SHIB) in the past 24 hours, indicating a rise in whale activity, which is a positive sign of interest from the investors. Along with the increased activity from whales, the ecosystem’s growth is also a sign of an unprecedented price hike for SHIB. Despite a generally bearish outlook in the altcoin market, the on-chain data suggests that SHIB could reclaim its 30-day high of $0.00002488. Moreover, the possibility of SHIB Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) applications being filed could attract institutional investment, further fueling a rally. Holding SHIB for at least another seven months could maximize potential gains during this anticipated bull run. Dogecoin(DOGE) Bullish Outlook For Long-Term Holders According to the analysis from BlockchainReporter.net, Dogecoin (DOGE) is showing signs of a potential bull run, which could be beneficial for investors holding for the long term. As of February 11, 2025, DOGE is trading in a consolidation range and may have bullish momentum in the future based on technical indicators such as MACD. If DOGE sustains within the support zone of $0.248-$0.255 and breaks the resistance of $0.262-$0.265, the coin can easily outperform its recent highs towards the target range of $0.268-$0.275. This scenario aligns with the HOLD strategy for DOGE and would require an investor to wait for at least another seven months. This would maximize gains, as the market will start to enter a bull run alongside other promising coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB). Cardano(ADA) Breakout: Aiming for $1.11 Cardano (ADA) recently broke out of a major resistance level at $0.80, suggesting that a bullish falling wedge was forming and has now been broken. Technical indicators like MACD and DMI suggest a bullish momentum increase, which could result in further gains. Should this trend continue, ADA might target a 40% increase to reach $1.11. However, if the momentum wanes, a retreat could see ADA testing support at $0.16. This situation positions ADA as a candidate for investment if one plans to hold for at least another seven months to capitalize on a possible extended bull run. Conclusion With the market poised for another breakout, patience is key. Rexas Finance , Cardano, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu each present compelling reasons to hold, whether through innovation, real-world utility, or strong market sentiment. RXS, in particular, stands out with its asset-backed model and imminent launch, while ADA and DOGE continue to maintain relevance. These coins could deliver impressive gains as the next few months unfold, making them top picks for long-term investors.

The latest duties, announced suddenly on Friday via Truth Social as per usual, will take effect on March 4. China’s Ministry of Commerce responded within hours, warning that it will take “all necessary measures” to protect its economy. “If the US insists on having its own way, China will counter with all necessary measures to defend its legitimate rights and interests,” a Ministry of Commerce spokesperson said, per a report from Bloomberg News. The statement follows Beijing’s past commitment to take “corresponding steps” in response to Washington’s economic measures. Markets take a hit as investors react The market reaction was immediate. Hong Kong-listed Chinese stocks plunged 3.9% Friday morning, which is their worst single-day loss since October. The CSI 300 Index, which tracks the largest companies on the mainland, dropped 1.9%, ending its longest winning streak in a month. The offshore yuan briefly fell overnight before recovering 0.1% to 7.29 per dollar, as the People’s Bank of China stepped in to stabilize the currency, per data from MarketWatch. Bond yields across China also slumped as economic concerns grew. Investors, already on edge about Trump’s trade policies, reacted to the sudden tariff announcement by moving funds into safer assets. The People’s Bank of China has been working to support the financial system, but rising borrowing costs and tightening liquidity have raised concerns about economic stability. The timing of the tariffs adds a lot of pressure on China’s President Xi Jinping as the duties will go into effect just one day before Xi and his top officials gather for the National People’s Congress, the most important political meeting of the year. There, his government will unveil its economic blueprint for 2025, outlining key policies on trade, domestic growth, and financial stability. While the tariffs won’t force a change in China’s official economic targets, they could dampen sentiment. At a Friday meeting, Xi and his Politburo talked about the need to expand domestic demand and stabilize financial markets—two topics that are expected to dominate discussions next week. Despite escalating tensions, Xi has urged his team to remain calm, likely due to the fact that he and Trump like each other a lot and have said so on many occasions. The Chinese leader has yet to speak with Trump since his return to office, even though the US president has repeatedly said that a conversation is expected soon. But high-level talks between Chinese and American officials continue behind the scenes. Vice Premier He Lifeng met with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent last week in what was the second major dialogue since Trump’s inauguration. China’s Defense Ministry also confirmed that discussions with the US military are in the works. China’s countermeasures: Trade war tools ready China has a long history of striking back when tariffs take effect. In the last round of trade tensions, Beijing responded within seconds of Washington’s new duties kicking in. The measures included additional tariffs on US goods, an antitrust investigation into Google , and new restrictions on critical mineral exports that the US relies on. China also blacklisted major American companies, preventing them from doing business in the country. A similar response is expected this time, according to JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs economists. One major tool at China’s disposal is the suspension of US tariff waivers, which coincidentally expire today. These waivers have allowed certain US imports to enter China without facing retaliatory tariffs. While Beijing has previously extended these waivers, it has yet to announce an extension this time—strongly suggesting that they will be left to expire. The Trump administration is also tightening restrictions on China beyond tariffs. Over the past two weeks, Washington has announced new investment curbs, proposed shipping fees for goods transported on Chinese-made vessels, and has been pressuring Mexico to also impose tariffs on Chinese imports. For Americans and American businesses, the effect of the tariffs will be felt quickly. China remains the largest US trading partner on a single-country basis, and new duties mean higher costs for importers. The US Federal Reserve actually reported in January that official trade data underestimates how much the US actually imports from China. That means the actual price impact of these tariffs could be far worse than expected. Meanwhile, China’s financial system is facing its own set of challenges. The People’s Bank of China has been actively supporting the yuan, prioritizing currency stability over aggressive monetary easing. However, that decision has led to a liquidity crunch, with short-term borrowing costs surging. The yield on one-year AAA-rated negotiable certificates of deposit, a key funding instrument for banks, jumped past 2% this week—the highest since June. The central bank’s reluctance to inject more liquidity has driven borrowing costs even higher. The rate on one-year medium-term lending facility loans—the People’s Bank of China’s key policy tool—was surpassed for the first time since October, thanks to a tightening credit environment.

A report by TheMinerMag shows that mining revenue held steady at approximately $1.4 billion in January. However, industry dynamics are shifting, with network hashrates fluctuating and public mining companies facing operational challenges. Bitcoin’s network activity reached 780 exahashes per second (EH/s) in January, following sustained growth from 642 EH/s in September to 779 EH/s by December. Notably, public mining companies once controlled 35% of total Bitcoin rewards, saw their market share decline to 30% amid operational curtailments.

The price of THORChain (RUNE) changed hands around $1.20, dipping sharply after hitting highs above $1.60. RUNE faced rejection at the resistance level that has previously proved tough for bulls on multiple occasions year-to-date. Notably, the dump from highs of $1.63 for RUNE coincides with the sharp sell-off that sent Bitcoin (BTC) below $80,000 early Friday. However, the THORChain network was also seeing increased chatter as one of its top developers announced an exit. What is THORChain? THORChain is a decentralised exchange providing for native Bitcoin (BTC) cross-chain swaps. Its decentralised finance infrastructure is available across several blockchain networks. Meanwhile, its cross-chain asset rails and liquidity are accessible for industry players including Trust, Ledger, OKX, and Bitget. As the platform allows for anonymous cross-chain swaps, it brings to the fore benefits of decentralization in liquidity management. However, there are concerns that threat actors are misusing these platforms. This has resulted in considerable discussions around crypto crime an what can be done. Chainflip, for instance, instituted an upgrade to block blacklisted addresses following the $1.4 billion Bybit hack. RUNE price falls as THORChain developer Pluto exits On February 27, THORChain developer Pluto announced he was leaving the DEX protocol. While he did not expound on the reason for his exit, it comes amid significant chatter around hackers’ use of the platform. In particular, the North Korean-backed Lazarus Group has used THORChain to launder huge sums of its $1.4 billion Bybit hack funds. Pluto (9R) @Pluto9r · Follow **Moving on from THORChain**Validators, developers, members of the community: effectively immediately, I will no longer be contributing to THORChain.

The developer had supported efforts to prevent illicit funds flowing through the platform. “TCB”, a THORChain validator, confirmed this via X. “As I mentioned yesterday, I will also see myself out if we don’t rapidly adopt a solution to stop NK flows, so this will likely be one of my last posts on the TC subject,” TCB noted . North Korea-backed Lazarus Group exploited a vulnerability with the Safe wallet to loot over 400k Ether (ETH) from Bybit. While the laundering that followed used platforms such as eXch and Chainflip, a significant amount of the swaps to BTC happened on THORChain. Blockchain intelligence and analytics platform Arkham noted that as of February 27, the hackers had laundered more than $240 million via THORChain.

And it’s showing in the markets. Most top coins are struggling to find their footing, but Solana is slowly changing this momentum. After taking a 20% hit, SOL has bounced back with a 3.5% gain just in the last day. That said, anyone who’s used Solana knows the network still gets bogged down during high traffic – a problem that’s been around for years. That’s where Solaxy ($SOLX) may help. This new Layer-2 project is designed to take some of the load off Solana’s main chain. The crypto community seems to see the potential here – they’ve already poured $24M into the presale, which says a lot about the confidence in this solution. Visit the Solaxy ($SOLX) presale now Solana’s Resurgence in 2025 – Can It Overcome Past Struggles? As 2025 unfolds, Solana’s journey through the crypto market has been anything but dull. Bullish sentiment closed last year, but 2025 began with uncertainty. Despite a drop from $250, there’s a reason for optimism. SOL currently trades around $138. It climbed from recent lows and found its way to a positive zero-ground in the environment that still struggles to find the right direction. While it remains well below its all-time high of $260 from November 2021, it’s far from the $8 lows of 2022. Beyond price action, the network expands further. Institutional players support its growth as Franklin Templeton files for a Solana-based ETF, which signals rising mainstream interest. The network wants to strengthen its infrastructure with upgrades that boost validator performance and ease network strain. Still, congestion remains its Achilles’ heel. A surge of Trump-themed projects in January once again tested the network’s limits, caused transaction delays, and led to failed swaps. It’s clear that Solana needs solutions to sustain momentum. And that’s exactly what innovations like Solaxy ($SOLX) want to address. Visit the Solaxy ($SOLX) presale now Solaxy’s Layer-2 Solution Could Be the Key to Solana’s Future Solana’s biggest advantages—speed and low fees—often take a hit when demand surges. Heavy traffic can slow transactions, cause failures, and disrupt everything from DeFi platforms to NFT marketplaces. Solaxy ($SOLX) introduces a new approach to Solana’s scalability as the first Layer-2 meme coin designed to keep the network congestion-free . Instead of acting as a mere fix, Solaxy provides real value and cultivates an engaged community. This approach makes transactions faster and cheaper and puts Solaxy on the forefront of the best crypto presales in 2025. At the same time, it reduces pressure on Solana’s main network and makes sure that users get a seamless experience even when activity spikes. Visit the Solaxy ($SOLX) presale now Regardless of a weak market, this ICO held its position and secured $24 million before launch, while others struggled to gain support. Moreover, it blends the best of Ethereum and Solana and offers a multi-chain framework that delivers unmatched speed, reliability, and security. This next-gen approach might make it a critical part of Solana’s future. At the heart of Solaxy’s ecosystem is the $SOLX token. Early adopters can get in at just $0.001648, with staking rewards surpassing 170% APY. Solaxy stakers can access their tokens a week after the project goes live or extend their stake for three years to earn even more. As $SOLX continues to attract close to $1 million weekly, the presale offers a rare chance to lock in tokens at the lowest possible price. Visit the Solaxy ($SOLX) presale now Crypto Influencer Says Solaxy Could 50x in 2025 – The Best Presale to Buy Right Now? Crypto influencer Borch is hyped about Solaxy, calling it the best presale to get into right now—he even thinks it could be 50x in 2025. In a recent video, he explained to his viewers why Solaxy could be a game-changer for the Solana ecosystem. It’s launching the first-ever layer 2 blockchain for Solana, designed to fix one of its biggest problems: network congestion. Whenever Solana gets overloaded with activity, transactions slow down or fail altogether. Solaxy plans to solve that with off-chain computation and transaction bundling, making transactions faster, cheaper, and way more reliable. Borch Crypto even said, “These guys are building it to withstand any amount of transactions per second.” On top of that, the project has a solid roadmap, with centralized exchange listings and the launch of its layer 2 blockchain coming soon. Visit the Solaxy ($SOLX) presale now Final Words Solana’s journey has been filled with challenges, yet it remains one of the most promising blockchains. More institutions embrace it, and developers expand its ecosystem, but congestion still delays progress. Solaxy ($SOLX) is a new presale that provides a real solution. With nearly $24 million raised in presale, the market recognizes its potential in solving Solana’s scalability concerns, while ensuring high returns as one of the best meme coin presales in Q1 2025.

As the flag bearer crypto plows on, XRP at $2.03 is stuck, with whales’ sell-offs hindering its rise. In another twist, a fresh Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is booming with a huge $16 value target. The recently launched DeFi token is getting plenty of attention as it navigates the second phase of presale. In just a matter of days, the presale has raised over $1.8 million in financing and attracted over $1.8 million in investors. The investors have just a short while to purchase tokens for $0.015 as the price rises 33.33% to $0.02 in the next phase. People who are participating in Phase 2 can earn a possible return on investment of 300%, with launch price being $0.06. As utility tokens come into focus, Mutuum Finance could reach $16 surpassing BTC and XRP in growth. Mutuum Finance: The Future of Decentralized Lending Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing DeFi lending with its dual-lending structure, merged Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) structures. On the P2C model, users hold stablecoins like USDT in pools of loans, while users get access to crypto-backed loans utilizing assets like ETH. In the P2P model, the middlemen are cut out, and lenders and borrowers agree on terms directly. The hybrid setup offers increased security, flexibility, and profitability and has liquidity providers making as much as 10% APY. By cutting out middlemen, Mutuum Finance is cost-saving on borrowing costs and rewarding liquidity providers better. With second-by-second transactions, absolute transparency, and user-first orientation, it’s revolutionizing the benchmark in decentralized finance. Security, Stability & Long-Term Growth Security is its highest priority to Mutuum Finance. The platform is undergoing third-party audits, has open-source smart contracts, and is set to release a fully collateralized USD-pegged stablecoin to provide price stability. In addition, there is a buyback program that is maintained through fees on the platform to ensure long-term token value. Attracting retail and institutional investors alike, Mutuum Finance is a secure, high-yielding DeFi investment with good risk management and a robust lending model. The rate of the project’s expansion is a reflection of the venture’s popularity, with over 3,400 investors already on board. A Prime Opportunity for Early Investors Mutuum Finance is currently in Phase 2 of its presale, where investors can buy MUTM tokens for as low as $0.015 before the price rises gradually over 11 phases to $0.06 at launch. Early investors can potentially make a 300% return before the token even reaches major exchanges. Experts are predicting MUTM could surge over $5 after launch, making it one of the most anticipated DeFi tokens of 2025. Investors who got in during Phase 1 already have a 50% return, and presale has already hit over $1.8 million. To encourage adoption and reward early adopters, Mutuum Finance is giving away $100,000 in MUTM tokens. Ten winners will each receive $10,000, and the referral program rewards users who refer new investors with additional incentives, further expanding the community even quicker. Mutuum Finance is rapidly emerging as one of the most prominent players in the DeFi market, offering an innovative lending mechanism, solid security, and excellent early progress. As Bitcoin breaks to $148,000 and XRP is subject to selling pressure, MUTM presale is providing investors with a chance to buy in early at a price of just $0.015, before the price jumps to $0.06 on launch. The profit margin is tremendous with a forecasted target of $16.

According to Dune Analytics , the protocol’s daily trading revenue has plunged by 96.8%, dropping from its $1 million peak on January 2 to under $35,000 as of February 27. The Base network’s virtual app revenue has been particularly weak, generating less than $1,000 per day for 10 consecutive days—a stark contrast to its $859,000 daily high on October 27, 2024. Virtuals Protocol Records $28K on Base, Just $6K on Solana in Daily Revenue On February 27, Virtuals recorded $28,492 in revenue from Base and just $6,300 from Solana. Meanwhile, the number of new AI agents created on the platform has remained below 10 per day for the past 10 days. Initially launched on Base, Virtuals Protocol gained attention for its AI agents, which can manage crypto wallets and tip social media users to boost engagement. The project’s expansion to Solana on January 25 was seen as an opportunity to tap into a thriving ecosystem. However, Solana’s reputation has taken a hit in recent weeks due to a wave of failed presidential meme coins and increasing concerns over scams on the network. Currently, about 170,000 unique wallets hold Virtuals agents’ tokens on Base, compared to just 11,000 on Solana. Overall wallet activity has also declined, with only 7,642 wallets trading at least one token on February 27. Notably, Virtuals Protocol’s native token has fallen over 14% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. The drop coincides with Bitcoin’s 20% decline over the past week, as global trade tensions continue to weigh on the broader crypto market.

Once ranked 68th by market capitalization, it has now slipped to the 92nd spot, signaling a fading interest in the AI-powered platform. Coinbase Completes First AI-to-AI Crypto Transaction Between Bots In August, Coinbase conducted its first AI-to-AI crypto transaction between two bots. At the time, CEO Armstrong said that a large language model (LLM) successfully used crypto tokens to purchase AI tokens from another AI bot. While AI bots cannot possess traditional bank accounts, they can own cryptocurrency wallets, enabling them to conduct transactions with humans, businesses, and other AI entities. Armstrong highlighted the efficiency of these transactions, emphasizing their “instant, global, and fee-free” nature. However, Armstrong acknowledged the current limitations of AI agents. Despite advancements, AI agents often struggle to complete tasks independently, hindered by technological constraints and the inability to acquire necessary resources. For instance, an AI agent cannot book a flight ticket without a payment method. Armstrong envisions a future where AI agents can overcome these limitations, leading to significant advancements. He believes that AI-powered transactions could revolutionize industries, particularly e-commerce, by enabling AI-driven checkout processes. Other industry experts also predict that AI bots could soon become the dominant force in blockchain transactions.

Is this the time to buy $ETH and $SOL? What about $BNB? Bulls simply must step in and save the day for $ETH Source: TradingView The $ETH price is at the bottom, of that there can be no doubt. Could it still plunge down through the last major support and the ascending bull market trendline? Yes, anything is possible. However, if Ethereum is to continue as the leading layer 1 blockchain, and crypto is to remain a viable asset class, this last line in the sand really needs to hold. These are strong words, but falling through this last ditch defence and confirming below would probably put the kibosh on this current bull market. There are support levels at $1,900 and at $1,700, but this is just for what it’s worth. The bulls simply must come in and save the day at the current price level. A bounce for $SOL from major support? Source: TradingView For the price of $SOL, things could be considered to be even worse. $SOL has crashed through its bull market trendline by a country mile, and is now at a band of support that simply must hold. Within this band of support lies the 0.618 Fibonacci, drawn for the entire bull market. Therefore, a bounce from here would make a lot of sense. At the bottom of the chart is the Stochastic RSI, showing that the indicator lines have bottomed, ready to cross back up again and bring much needed upside price momentum back into the market. $BNB holding up really well Source: TradingView Finally, if one looks at the weekly chart for $BNB, we see a cryptocurrency that is actually holding up really well. Only having dropped 36% in total from the high, this looks great in comparison with its layer 1 competitors. In fact, the current price level is only 27% down from the high. The ascending trendline below is still nicely intact, and major support looks to have been found at $503. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI indicator lines do look as though they might get rejected from the 20.00 level, but the weekend will either confirm or deny this. It is often said that those cryptocurrencies that hold up the best during correctional phases are often those that bounce the highest once the trend turns around.

Rumors are swirling that XYZVerse might soon eclipse popular tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. With predictions of a significant surge on the horizon, anticipation is building to see if XYZVerse will redefine the landscape of digital assets. XYZVerse: The Best New Meme Project You Can’t Afford to Bench! XYZ is your exclusive VIP pass to a sports-driven, meme-fueled revolution. Think of it as the MVP of the XYZVerse ecosystem, where crypto enthusiasts can score big off the growing demand for meme coins. But every revolution needs a hero—someone willing to fight against the odds and push the $XYZ token to the top. That hero is XYZepe , the masked fighter, the true believer, the relentless $XYZ holder whose mission is to bring XYZVerse to the #1 spot on CoinMarketCap. It’s about proving that underdogs can rise to greatness. With millions of sports fans ready to hit the field, the XYZVerse ecosystem is set to keep expanding—and your rewards will slam dunk through the roof! And here’s a highlight reel moment: XYZVerse has been officially recognized as the Best NEW Meme Project—a title that underscores its explosive potential in the meme coin arena. XYZ presale is your first-quarter chance to get in before the mind-blowing explosion! Meme coins are the undisputed champions of the crypto world, and XYZ is set to crush the competition. Currently priced at $0.0025, $XYZ remains an undervalued crypto gem poised to rise to $0.1 at the final presale stage. But victory doesn’t happen overnight—it takes dedication, strategy, and a fighter willing to go the distance. XYZepe knows the battle ahead, but with the community behind him, he’s taking $XYZ to legendary status. With upcoming listings on major CEX and DEX platforms, rock-solid defense in the form of audited smart contracts, and a fully vetted team, XYZ is already ahead of the game. The first-mover advantage is key here—get in before the crowd storms the field, and you’ll be sitting on way bigger returns! XYZepe is fighting for glory—will you stand with him? Dogecoin Unleashed: The Shiba Inu Meme Coin That’s No Joke Dogecoin began in 2013 as a light-hearted alternative to serious cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. With its Shiba Inu dog logo and playful style, it was created as a joke by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer. Unlike Bitcoin’s limited supply, Dogecoin was designed to be plentiful, with 10,000 new coins mined every minute and no maximum cap. This abundance made it accessible and fun, quickly attracting a loyal community. It showcased the power of internet culture and memes in shaping new forms of digital money. In 2021, Dogecoin’s value surged, fueled by social media buzz and endorsements from figures like Elon Musk. It soared into the top ten cryptocurrencies, with a market cap exceeding $50 billion. While it started as a meme, Dogecoin’s technology offers fast and low-cost transactions, making it useful for tipping and small payments. In the current market, its strong community support and high visibility make it an intriguing option. As crypto trends evolve, Dogecoin exemplifies how community and humor can drive serious market movements, turning a joke into a significant player in the crypto world. Shiba Inu: The Memecoin with Big Ambitions on Ethereum Shiba Inu (SHIB) is more than a meme; it’s a cryptocurrency that started as a playful nod to Dogecoin but has grown with serious goals. Launched in August 2020 by the anonymous Ryoshi, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain, tapping into its vast ecosystem. Initially, one quadrillion tokens were created, and half were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. He donated a significant portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, boosting SHIB’s profile and showing a commitment to community causes. What sets SHIB apart is its use of Ethereum, allowing for projects like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange. Plans for an NFT platform and a governance system run by a DAO highlight its potential for real utility. In the current market, memecoins are grabbing attention, but SHIB’s technological backbone gives it an edge over others like Dogecoin, which doesn’t have Ethereum compatibility. As the crypto world evolves, SHIB’s focus on decentralized apps and community governance could make it an attractive option for those looking beyond just the hype. Conclusion While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have strong communities, XYZVerse aims for 20,000% growth by uniting sports fans, positioning itself to outperform its predecessors in the current bull run.

This significant buying activity highlights the growing confidence of institutional and high-net-worth investors in Cardano’s long-term potential. Whale accumulation is often seen as an indicator of bullish sentiment, as these investors typically have access to extensive market research and insights that influence their decisions. The timing of this accumulation suggests that whales are positioning themselves for potential price appreciation in the coming months. Impact on Market Dynamics and ADA Price Movements The influx of whale purchases has had a noticeable impact on Cardano’s market performance. Over the past week, ADA’s price has surged by approximately 21%, demonstrating renewed market enthusiasm following a period of volatility. At the time of writing, ADA is trading at $0.584319, marking a slight 0.12% decline from the previous close, but still showing resilience in a fluctuating market. The intraday price has ranged between a high of $0.678797 and a low of $0.582422, suggesting that the recent accumulation phase has contributed to stabilizing the asset’s price while fueling buying momentum. Over the past 72 hours, whales bought more than 130 million #Cardano $ADA ! pic.twitter.com/1L6pCFaKvJ — Ali (@ali_charts) February 28, 2025 Historically, whale activity tends to precede major price movements. Whale investors accumulate large positions when market sentiment is low, often leading to supply shocks that drive prices higher. Given ADA’s recent trading patterns, this accumulation phase could signal the beginning of a more extended bullish trend if retail investors follow suit. Cardano’s Growing Ecosystem and Institutional Interest The whale accumulation aligns with Cardano’s ongoing network developments and increasing adoption across various sectors. The blockchain continues to expand its capabilities, particularly in decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and smart contracts. With the successful implementation of the Alonzo upgrade and ongoing improvements in Cardano’s scalability and efficiency, the network is becoming a more attractive option for developers and investors alike. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Institutional interest in Cardano has also increased, with major financial entities exploring its potential as a sustainable and scalable blockchain solution. The network’s proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which is significantly more energy-efficient than proof-of-work (PoW) alternatives, has made it a favorable option for institutions seeking environmentally friendly blockchain investments. The recent whale activity could indicate that institutional investors are increasing their exposure to ADA in anticipation of future growth. What’s Next for ADA? Whales’ accumulation of over 130 million ADA tokens signals that high-value investors see potential in Cardano’s future. This strategic buying spree will stabilize ADA’s price and set the stage for potential upward momentum. As the blockchain continues to innovate and expand, and as institutional adoption grows, ADA could experience further gains in the near term. Investors will closely watch price movements and broader market trends to assess whether this whale accumulation will translate into sustained bullish momentum.

Though the debate continues, some have pointed to a $1.50 Cardano price prediction by the end of 2025. Meanwhile, in meme coins, Panshibi (SHIBI) has been highlighted as a frontrunner with major growth potential. With SHIBI gaining momentum, is ADA still worth holding, or is it time to jump ship? Cardano Price Prediction: $1.50 By Late 2025? Cardano (ADA) is shaping up to be a solid long-term investment as it continues to build out its ecosystem with major technical upgrades. Currently trading at $0.663, ADA has been holding steady, largely due to its strong community support and decentralized holder distribution. Unlike other cryptocurrencies that whales heavily influence, 91.52% of ADA’s supply is held by retail investors, while whales account for just 8.48%. This means ADA is less prone to extreme volatility, making it a safer bet for those looking at long-term growth. Cardano Analytics: CoinMarketCap One of the most exciting developments ahead is Cardano’s integration with Bitcoin. By late 2025, ADA plans to allow Bitcoin users to interact with Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem, opening up new liquidity and transaction possibilities. The network is also rolling out Midnight, a privacy-focused sidechain that could revolutionize on-chain security and transaction privacy. Some analysts believe these developments could fuel a major price surge. According to recent projections, the Cardano price prediction for late 2025 could see ADA breaking past the $1.50 mark if these updates gain traction. Analysts at CoinCodex suggest Cardano could see some rapid growth in the next 3 months too, landing on $0.86 by late May . While the crypto market remains unpredictable, Cardano’s strong fundamentals and engaged community make it one of the more resilient projects in the space. Panshibi Pushes Meme Coins In A New Direction Panshibi (SHIBI) has graced the meme coin space with an offering that is ahead of its time. The project is pushing meme coins in the right direction, showing that they can be much more when they include real utility for investors and a philanthropic mission at their center. Panshibi is designed to generate real rewards for its investors. With staking rewards reaching up to 1,200% APY, token holders can earn significant passive income simply by participating in the ecosystem. A dedicated 15% of the total token supply has been set aside to ensure staking rewards remain attractive and sustainable. Early adopters also gain access to the Bamboo Private VIP Club, which provides exclusive benefits to those who get in ahead of the crowd. The crypto space is still plagued by scams and security risks, but Panshibi has implemented some of the most advanced security measures in the meme coin market to mitigate these risks. The smart contract has been fully audited by Coinsult, ensuring that it is free from vulnerabilities. Additionally, liquidity is locked for 10 years and team tokens are secured for two years, preventing sudden sell-offs and manipulation. These security measures give investors confidence that Panshibi is built for long-term stability. Many meme coins lose momentum after launch, but Panshibi has structured a roadmap that extends far beyond its presale phase to ensure its long term growth. The team has outlined plans for listings on major decentralized and centralized exchanges, NFT collaborations and the development of a social-fi ecosystem that will keep the community engaged. With ongoing innovations in place, Panshibi is ensuring that it remains relevant and valuable long after its launch. Unlike most meme coins that exist solely in the digital space, Panshibi is actively contributing to a meaningful cause. A portion of the project’s ecosystem funds panda conservation initiatives, providing resources for habitat preservation, wildlife research and breeding programs to help protect the species. As crypto projects look for ways to integrate with real-world impact, Panshibi is showing that blockchain technology can support environmental causes while delivering financial value to investors. Investors Race To Grab Their Share Of SHIBI Tokens Investors continue to race to the Panshibi presale to grab their share of SHIBI tokens before the price skyrockets. The presale has already raised almost $1.18 million, with tokens on offer for an alluring price of just $0.005 in the current stage. As the project continues to gain momentum, Panshibi is proving that it is more than just another meme coin – it’s a project with staying power. Analysts are taking note, projecting an explosive 1,200% price rise during the presale phase with more growth expected post-launch. For any savvy investor who wants to be a part of the future of meme coins, this project is not one to overlook in 2025.

Here Are the Most Critical Price Levels to Watch!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/5-7-billion-in-options-to-expire-in-bitcoin-and-ethereum-here-are-the-most-critical-price-levels-to-watch/,"While the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins were going through difficult days, there were sharp declines. As BTC fell below $80,000, a level not seen since November, today, as every Friday, the expiration date for options contracts in the crypto market has come. These options are even more important because they fall on the last Friday of both the week and the month. According to the news of Singapore-based crypto options data platform Greeks.live, 59,000 Bitcoin and 529,000 Ethereum options will expire on February 28 on the Deribit derivatives exchange. Accordingly, the Put/Call Ratio of BTC options is 0.7, the maximum loss point is $96,000 and the notional value is $4.66 billion. When we look at Ethereum, ETH options have a Put/Call Ratio of 0.52, a maximum loss point of $3,000, and a notional value of $1.12 billion. Impact on Bitcoin and Ethereum Prices! Greeks.live analysts said that a downtrend is dominant in the market and that investors see $82,000 as a critical support level that must be protected for the long-term rise to continue. The “maximum loss” price is the level where option buyers suffer the greatest loss and market makers see the greatest profit. At this point, the closer the Bitcoin price is to $96,000 and the Ethereum price to $3,000, the greater the loss option investors will experience, so major players and market makers in the market usually try to push the price to these levels. Also, historically, as options approach expiration, prices tend to drift toward the maximum pain level, making $96,000 for BTC and $3,000 for ETH a critical level to watch. What Does the Put/Call Ratio Signal for Bitcoin and Ethereum? The put/call ratio is calculated by dividing the number of put options by the number of call options. A ratio below 1 means there are more buys than puts, indicating an uptrend. A ratio above 1 means there are more puts than calls, indicating a downtrend. A ratio close to 1 means the market is balanced or neutral. For Bitcoin, this ratio is 0.7, indicating that the upward trend is still ongoing. For Ethereum, it is 0.52, indicating an upward trend. Accordingly, these rates indicate an upward trend for BTC and ETH. However, time will tell how these rates will affect the price. At this point, do not make your investment decisions based on a single data or report. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: $5.7 Billion in Options to Expire in Bitcoin and Ethereum!

Hold Tight to Your ETH, Sell Your PEPE, and Enter This Viral Presale for 10x Gains appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As the crypto market is facing increasing volatility, investors are looking for ways to secure promising gains. Therefore, analysts have pointed out the best strategies that could drive 100% gains, including holding on to the ETH token despite the current Ethereum price drop and selling the PEPE token. At the same time, crypto experts are pointing toward the viral presale of DTX Exchange which is making waves in the crypto industry with its 10x gains potential. This emerging platform has already secured more than $15.2 million in its presale and guarantees a 2x return on investment right after listing. DTX Exchange: A Viral Presale with 100% Gains and with 10x Potential The DTX Exchange presale success is going viral in the crypto market because of its massive growth potential. The DTX token is selling at $0.18 in the ongoing bonus presale, which will surge to $0.36 after the launch, guaranteeing investors the chance to double their profits. In addition, considering the widespread adoption of DTX Exchange, experts are also anticipating that it could rise to 10x, which means its price could surge up to $1.8. While holding the ETH token will eventually result in a 100% increase, DTX’s projected trajectory could put investors on the path to far greater gains. All these optimistic speculations around DTX Exchange are driven by the innovative hybrid functionality of its infrastructure, which could set new standards for crypto trading. The platform also offers an unmatched transaction speed of 200,000 TPS by leveraging VulcanX Blockchain technology, so traders can perform trades at high speed with low latency. Similarly, the platform will offer Phoenix Wallet which is designed with an exclusive quantum-proof focus. It could protect users’ assets from potential security breaches. Likewise, DTX Exchange supports a wide selection of different asset classes and ensures unified hassle-free management for these assets. In addition, DTX could allow traders to access advanced trading features such as charting software and analytical tools that could enhance trading efficiency. With these diverse offerings and groundbreaking presale success, DTX Exchange could deliver a promising prospect for investors looking to maximize their gains. Ethereum Price Drop: A Strategic Opportunity for 100% Gains? The recent security breach of Bybit exchange has caused a storm in the crypto market and resulted in a significant decline in the Ethereum price. This drop took the Ethereum price even below the low of the February 3 market crash to around $2,286. Source: CoinMarketCap This sharp decline of below $2,500 has increased the selling pressure around the Ethereum price. However, analysts are predicting that this downward trend of the Ethereum price is going to be followed by a capitulation phase in which the selling pressure will increase further. Along with this, a period of accumulation might happen, which could drive the next bull cycle for the Ethereum price. Hence, industry insiders suggest holding the ETH tokens tightly as it could potentially offer 100% gains in the long-term. Likewise, crypto experts are also recommending entering the viral presale of DTX Exchange as a prime opportunity to secure massive 10x gains. PEPE Crashes Hard: Selling Now Could Be the Smartest Move As of February 27, Pepecoin (PEPE) is trading at around $0.0000084, indicating a massive drop from its January high at around $0.000022. Source: CoinMarketCap Analysts believe the price of the PEPE token has been trading inside a falling wedge pattern without any signs of a potential breakout. From a monthly outlook, the PEPE token has dropped more than 34%. Further, the increased selling pressure has trapped the coin in a prolonged downward momentum. Industry insiders warn if the PEPE token continues this trajectory it might crash further to $0.0000065. Therefore, experts are urging investors to sell their PEPE holdings and shift their focus to DTX Exchange that could drive 10x gains. Final Thoughts While the Ethereum price drop could serve as an opportunity to secure 100% gains and selling PEPE could cut losses, DTX Exchange could offer much bigger gains with a potential 10x surge. With DTX nearing its launch, traders have limited time to lock in their guaranteed 2x returns by grabbing the token at a price of $0.18. Hence, experts advise investors not to miss out on this massive reward opportunity.

In January, registered losses stood at $73,915,700. Just a month later, this figure jumped to $1,528,342,400. The latter was the result of nine hacks. Additionally, the February number is an 18x increase from the same time a year prior. In February 2024, registered losses were $81,603,400, Immunefi researchers found. Notably, the majority of this sum was the result of a single hack. Crypto exchange Bybit lost $1.46 billion in the biggest hack in crypto’s history. This is followed by stablecoin bank Infini’s loss of $49.5 million . The top five losses also include zkLend ($9.5 million), Ionic Money ($8.6 million), and Cardex ($400,000). Source: Immunefi Meanwhile, observing the total losses year-to-date, the ecosystem lost $1,602,258,100 in 2025 so far. Immunefi found that this represents an 8x increase compared to $200 million during the same period last year. Additionally, it already surpassed the total losses for 2024 at $1.49 billion.

Actually, hacks account for 100% of the total losses – all of the $1.5 billion across the nine incidents. In the same time period, centralized finance (CeFi) again surpassed decentralized finance (DeFi) per the total amount lost, while DeFi still leads in the number of attacks. CeFi accounted for $1.46 billion or 95.5% of the total losses with a single incident (Bybit), while DeFi accounted for $68,342,400 or 4.5% across eight cases. Source: Immunefi At the same time, BNB Chain was the most targeted chain in February. More specifically, BNB Chain and Ethereum suffered four individual attacks each, which represents 72.8% of the total losses across targeted chains. Abstract , Mode , and Optimism suffered one attack each. Meanwhile, Immunefi says it has paid out over $112 million in total bounties so far, while saving over $25 billion in user funds. Several days ago, it launched Magnus , its AI-powered security orchestration platform that unites threat intelligence and automates security operations across a protocol’s security stack. In other words, the novel platform unifies security into a single platform that enables protocols to access, automate, and coordinate best-in-class security tools, Immunefi said.

The newer alternatives A good starting point is to look at newer, faster platforms, and Solana ( SOL ) is often mentioned; however, its genesis block was back in 2020, and 5 years is a long time in this industry. There are even newer, faster blockchains—including Sui, Aptos, Monad, and Fogo—with more to come. Technology is an enabler, but it alone does not dictate success (remember Betamax?). From a software point of view, success is even less certain as new ideas can be integrated into existing products. Focusing on Ethereum, when it was launched, it was a proof-of-work blockchain similar to Bitcoin ( BTC ) but has since undergone a number of major upgrades (with zero downtime), including its move to proof-of-stake. These upgrades will continue over the next five years, improving areas including performance, usability, and developer experience. Pectra, the next upgrade , will provide greater transaction capacity and improve Ethereum staking functionality. Many of these changes are new and reflect changes from the previous roadmaps. The Ethereum ecosystem is fortunate to have a large number of expert researchers in fields such as distributed systems and cryptography. Whilst sometimes accused of operating in “Ivory Towers,” what they have consistently shown is deep thought in the direction that Ethereum should take and this often leads to changes in direction. Move fast and break things may work in some environments, but probably not with a multibillion dollar compute platform. A key example here was the move from a scaling technology known as sharding to what we have now with the layer-2-centric roadmap. The key differences L2’s will turn out to be a key differentiator for Ethereum, even if the path to get there feels long. They enable disparate teams to build their own scaling solutions using different technologies, all tied back to the core Ethereum protocol. If you believe Solana has made all of the right design decisions, Eclipse is an L2 that plugs Solana technology into Ethereum. Similarly if you want Meta’s Move programming language, you can build on an L2 such as Movement. L2s open up new programming languages and can optimize for different characteristics, whether that be speed, privacy, decentralization, alignment with a corporation ( such as Sony ), or something else entirely. This means that developers and users of Ethereum can decide what is important and use the corresponding L2 whilst still benefiting from the liquidity, security, and existing applications built on Ethereum. Whilst we already have a huge number of L2s, development is still ongoing to improve interoperability between them with the goal of enabling the frictionless transfer of assets and composability of applications. To this end, there are a number of technical standards (both Ethereum Improvement Proposals and Rollup Improvement Proposals ) aimed at both short-term and longer improvements to the user experience. So, does the L2 roadmap make sense? The number (over 140 L2s) suggests that an awful lot of people (and engineering investment) think it does! In addition, whilst the “total value locked” metric has many flavors and many flaws, it indicates that L2s are achieving product market fit with $42bn of assets being held. This is getting close to the $166bn worth of tokens issued on Ethereum and significantly more than the tokens issued on other chains (excluding the protocol’s own tokens). Whilst L2s will offer many improvements, using Ethereum itself is getting faster with protocol-led improvements but then also infrastructure such as “transaction pre-confirmations,” providing users with sub-second confirmation of their transactions, comparable to the fastest alternative blockchains. Regarding value, the tokenization of real-world assets is a key use case for blockchains, and we are now seeing significant progress. Stablecoins representing USD are valued at $216bn, with 58% of those issued on Ethereum (the next biggest are Tron ( TRX ) with 28% and Solana with only 5%) and with a focus of the current US administration on stablecoin growth, those numbers are set to climb! With regards to more complex assets, BlackRock’s BUIDL fund tokenizes $500mm USD of Treasury Bills on Ethereum but is only one of over 150 tokenized assets with a combined value of over $3.8bn (excluding stablecoins!). This is also set to increase with issuers such as Ondo finance and Backed tokenizing more assets on Ethereum. No other chain or L2 comes close to this level of tokenized value. Opinion Slva stable Developers are the answer If an institution is looking to build a crypto project, its starting point will be the technical community. With over 10k developers working on Ethereum Virtual Machine based projects (3x more than the next closest ecosystem), it is likely developers will recommend Ethereum. As seen with a stream of projects from institutions ranging from Deutsche Bank through to President Trump’s World Liberty Finance. More important than developers is security and stability. One of the reasons that Ethereum has a lower transaction throughput and longer development cycle is the focus on decentralization, uptime, and resilience. The network is run on nodes using six different software stacks, meaning a bug in one will not halt the network. Similarly, the network is designed to survive regional catastrophes, with around 10,000 nodes running in countries all around the world on computers as simple as a mobile phone. These design goals are reflected in the 100% uptime of the network since genesis. This illustrates that there is space for different blockchains to focus on their respective strengths. Ethereum is the premier smart contract platform being adopted for use in decentralized finance and for institutions building new financial rails and tokenized products. Bitcoin is easily understood as a store of value, and Solana is currently leading the way for higher-performance, low-value transactions such as meme coin trading. If there is one benefit to the noise around the ETH price, it could be that it has galvanized a more outward-looking effort by the Ethereum ecosystem. There is a realization that focusing purely on building may not be enough. The Ethereum Foundation has reactivated their X.com accounts, leaders in the space are being more vocal, and organizations such as Etherealize are advocating for Ethereum in Washington and on Wall Street. The leader in any industry can never afford to stand still, and digging beyond the headlines, Ethereum is continuing to drive innovation.

Terra Classic (LUNC): A Blockchain For Stable Global Payments Terra Classic (LUNC) is a blockchain protocol designed to power price-stable global payment systems using fiat-pegged stablecoins. It combines the stability and widespread use of traditional currencies with the censorship-resistant features of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC). Launched in April 2019 after development began in January 2018, Terra Classic offers stablecoins pegged to currencies such as the U.S. dollar, South Korean won, Mongolian tugrik, and the IMF’s Special Drawing Rights. In May 2022, the original Terra chain was rebranded as Terra Classic, and its native token was renamed LUNA Classic (LUNC). A new chain, called Terra (LUNA), was launched without stablecoins. The addition of “Classic” may reference the Ethereum/Ethereum Classic split in 2017. Terra Classic aims to provide fast and affordable settlements, leveraging blockchain technology to enhance global payments. The attractiveness of LUNC in the current market cycle depends on various factors, including technological advancements and market conditions. Stellar (XLM): Bridging Financial Systems with Blockchain Technology Stellar (XLM) is a decentralized, open-source payments network that uses blockchain technology to enable quick and low-cost fund transfers. It does not favor any national currency and features its own cryptocurrency, Stellar Lumens (XLM). Since its inception in 2014, Stellar has processed billions of transactions and formed partnerships with major companies. It facilitates transfers of any currency type, including digital representations of national currencies and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Unlike many cryptocurrencies that aim to overhaul financial systems, Stellar seeks to enhance them by offering a unified network for collaboration among diverse financial systems. The potential of Stellar lies in its ability to connect financial institutions, payment systems, and individuals around the world. By enabling global fund transfers and currency conversions swiftly and affordably, it addresses key challenges in cross-border payments. Companies can build blockchain applications on Stellar or use the network for payments. The Stellar Development Foundation promotes network use and maintains its infrastructure. In the current market cycle, Stellar’s focus on enhancing existing financial systems rather than replacing them may appeal to those looking for practical blockchain solutions. Its established partnerships and ongoing development suggest that it continues to be a relevant player in the cryptocurrency space. Kaspa: A High-Throughput PoW Cryptocurrency with GHOSTDAG Protocol Kaspa is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency that implements the GHOSTDAG protocol. Unlike traditional blockchains, which orphan parallel blocks, GHOSTDAG allows them to coexist and orders them in consensus. This means the Kaspa blockchain operates as a block Directed Acyclic Graph (blockDAG), a generalization of Nakamoto consensus. This structure enables secure operations while maintaining very high block rates, currently at one block per second, with goals to increase to 10 blocks per second and eventually 100 blocks per second. The fast block rates lead to confirmation times that are limited primarily by internet latency. The Kaspa implementation includes features such as Reachability to query the DAG’s topology, block data pruning, and Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) proofs. Plans for block header pruning and subnetwork support aim to facilitate the future implementation of layer 2 solutions, enhancing scalability and efficiency. In the current market cycle, Kaspa’s approach to consensus and high throughput may attract attention from those interested in blockchain innovations. TRON (TRX): Decentralizing Digital Content Creation TRON (TRX) is a blockchain-based operating system developed by the Tron Foundation and launched in 2017. Initially, TRX tokens were ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum network, but they moved to their own network in 2018. The platform aims to give full ownership rights to digital content creators by enabling direct interaction between content producers and consumers. This removes intermediaries like YouTube or Apple, allowing creators to receive a larger share of the rewards for their work. The TRON network supports smart contracts, various blockchain systems, and decentralized applications (dApps). It uses a transaction model similar to Bitcoin’s UTXO, with transactions recorded on a public ledger. TRON was built to create a decentralized Internet and serves as a tool for developers to create dApps, acting as an alternative to Ethereum. The ability to create and share content without transaction fees is a notable feature. In the current market cycle, TRON’s focus on content creators and dApp development may appeal to users and developers looking for such platforms.",Sponsored,EN,0,0,LUNC|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|BTC|ETC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-28 12:06:37

Developed to address Bitcoin’s scalability challenges, the network allows off-chain payments, making Bitcoin more practical for everyday use. At Bitfinex, we were pioneers whose early adoption spurred its growth, showcasing its real world potential for diverse applications such as micropayments, social media tipping, and cross-border remittances. El Salvador’s Bitcoin adoption, powered by the Lightning-enabled Chivo Wallet and circular economies like Bitcoin Beach, highlights its real-world impact. As Lightning continues to evolve with advancements in scalability, privacy, and ease of use, it is poised to solidify Bitcoin’s role as a global financial system. 10 Years of Lightning: A Brief Overview of Bitcoin’s Premiere Layer 2 The Bitcoin Lightning Network is a second-layer protocol built on top of Bitcoin’s layer 1 to facilitate faster and more cost-effective transactions. It was designed to address Bitcoin’s scalability challenges, as the base layer struggles to handle a large number of transactions simultaneously, leading to delays and high fees during periods of heavy network congestion. By creating a secondary layer where off-chain transactions can be conducted, the Lightning Network offers a way to use Bitcoin for everyday transactions without compromising its decentralization or security. The Lightning Network was developed to overcome the limitations of Bitcoin’s original design, which can process only about 7 transactions per second. This limited throughput made it impractical for Bitcoin to serve as a medium for small, frequent payments, such as buying coffee or paying for digital services. The network was introduced to enable faster, cheaper transactions by reducing the burden on the main blockchain, thereby enhancing Bitcoin’s usability as a day-to-day currency without compromising its role as a secure store of value. The Lightning Network is Bitcoin’s only true Layer 2 solution that enables decentralized, fast, non-custodial, and low-cost payments with unilateral exit options, ensuring users retain full control of their funds without relying on third-party custody, a critical feature for maintaining Bitcoin’s trustless and censorship-resistance characteristics. The Lightning Network operates through the creation of payment channels between users. These channels allow participants to transact with one another off-chain, with only the opening and closing of the channel being recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain. Payment channels in the Lightning Network operate by locking a specific amount of Bitcoin in a multi-signature address , allowing two parties to conduct off-chain transactions by updating their shared balance state, with only the final state being recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain when the channel is closed. Within a channel, an unlimited number of transactions can occur almost instantaneously and at minimal cost. When the channel is closed, the net result of all transactions are batch written to the blockchain. This mechanism significantly reduces congestion and fees on the main Bitcoin network while maintaining a similar level of security, censorship-resistance, and autonomy. While the Lightning Network enhances Bitcoin’s scalability, reduces transaction fees, and improves the speed of payments, it does have limitations. Setting up and managing channels requires technical knowledge, and the network can struggle with large or complex payments due to liquidity constraints in certain channels. Additionally, the requirement for both parties to be online for transactions to occur introduces potential usability challenges. Despite these limitations, the Lightning Network is particularly well-suited for microtransactions, cross-border payments, and applications such as tipping content creators, streaming payments, or enabling instant retail transactions. It represents a critical step in making Bitcoin more versatile and accessible for real-world use cases in digital commerce. A Look at the History of Bitcoin’s 1st Layer 2 Global Payments Network The Lightning Network was first proposed in 2015 by Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja in a white paper that outlined a vision for scaling Bitcoin through a second-layer solution. The aim was to address Bitcoin’s scalability problem, which limited the number of transactions the blockchain could handle per second. By creating an off-chain network of payment channels, Lightning promised faster, cheaper transactions while preserving the security and decentralization of the Bitcoin blockchain. Early prototypes and implementations, such as those by Lightning Labs , Acinq , and Blockstream , laid the groundwork for a new era of Bitcoin usability, focusing on small and frequent transactions. In December 2019, Bitfinex became the first major Bitcoin exchange to integrate the Lightning Network, playing a pivotal role in its early adoption. We enabled users to deposit and withdraw Bitcoin through Lightning, significantly reducing transaction fees and processing times compared to on-chain transactions. This move not only provided a real world demonstration of the practical utility of the Lightning Network but also encouraged other exchanges and wallet providers to follow suit. Our early adoption helped build confidence in Lightning, showcasing its potential for scaling Bitcoin and fostering an ecosystem of users and developers. Since its launch, the Lightning Network has seen remarkable growth in both adoption and technological advancement. By 2025, the network’s capacity has expanded significantly, with more and more nodes and channels created daily. The Lightning Network powers innovative micropayment use cases, such as Nostr’s “zaps” for social media tipping, Podcasting 2.0 and Wavlake’s “boosts” and streaming payments, enabling listeners to directly support podcasters and musicians with seamless, instant, and low-cost transactions. Companies like Strike and Cash App have integrated Lightning to facilitate instant and low-cost Bitcoin payments globally, while developers continue to improve the protocol’s functionality, security, and user experience. Innovations like Atomic Multipath Payments (AMPs) and enhancements in channel liquidity management have addressed some of the network’s early limitations, making it more robust and reliable for a broader range of applications. Looking ahead, Bitcoiners can expect the Lightning Network to play a central role in Bitcoin’s evolution as a global payment system. With growing institutional interest and increasing integration into traditional financial systems, Lightning is poised to further enhance Bitcoin’s utility for micropayments, remittances, and even decentralized applications. Developers are working on solutions to improve routing, privacy, and scalability, which will make Lightning more accessible and efficient. As adoption accelerates, the network is set to bridge the gap between Bitcoin as a store of value and its potential as a widely used medium of exchange, solidifying its role in the broader financial ecosystem. The Driver Behind El Salvador’s Bitcoin Adoption-Based Economy The Lightning Network played a pivotal role in El Salvador’s groundbreaking Bitcoin adoption, serving as the backbone for fast and low-cost transactions that make Bitcoin practical for everyday use. When El Salvador declared Bitcoin legal tender in 2021, the government launched the Chivo Wallet , a state-backed Bitcoin wallet designed to leverage the Lightning Network for instant, near-zero-cost payments. Chivo ATMs were installed nationwide, allowing users to deposit or withdraw funds seamlessly, with the Lightning Network ensuring that transactions could scale efficiently to meet the demands of a population new to cryptocurrency. A prime example of Lightning’s impact can be seen in El Zonte, also known as Bitcoin Beach , where a Bitcoin circular economy has flourished. Bitcoin Beach lit the initial fuse which inspired El Salvador President Nayib Bukele’s nationwide Bitcoin policy. This coastal community pioneered the use of Bitcoin for everyday transactions, with merchants and residents relying on the Lightning Network to pay for goods and services, from groceries to surf lessons. The success of Bitcoin Beach has become a model for similar initiatives across the country, demonstrating the practicality of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange in regions with limited access to traditional financial services. In the small mountain community of Berlin , another hub of Bitcoin adoption in El Salvador, the Lightning Network has enabled a similar transformation. Local businesses and residents use Lightning to trade goods and services, fostering financial inclusion and reducing reliance on cash. These grassroots initiatives highlight Lightning’s ability to facilitate real-world use cases, driving Bitcoin adoption at the local level. As El Salvador continues its Bitcoin experiment in 2025 and beyond, the Lightning Network will likely remain central to expanding merchant adoption, supporting circular economies, and proving Bitcoin’s utility as a transformative financial tool. The upcoming Torogoz Dev Graduation Ceremony marks a significant milestone for the non-profit organization, which focuses on training Salvadoran students in Lightning Network development and connecting them with job opportunities in the growing Bitcoin and crypto ecosystem in El Salvador. As part of their graduation project, the students developed “ Torogoz Pay ,” a Lightning-integrated payment gateway designed to split payments across the production chain. For instance, when a customer purchases a product, such as a $5 bag of coffee, the payment is distributed in real-time to the individuals involved in its production, including the farmers, roasters and packagers, with instant payment splits sent directly to their Lightning wallets. This innovative system not only facilitates transparency and fairness in payments but also has the potential to serve both local and international markets. The graduating cohort, consisting of six individuals, including one woman, is now equipped with skills in Lightning node administration, system setup, and software development, contributing to El Salvador’s vision of becoming a global Bitcoin hub.

Bitcoin took another hit early Friday, falling below $80,000 and taking February's decline to over 20%. That spurred a bloodbath in the broader crypto market, with ether sliding below $2,100, a level it managed to hold since August. It's not just crypto. Increased volatility in cryptocurrencies mirrors trends in traditional markets. Compare the 10% jump in the Volmex BVIV, which tracks the 30-day implied volatility in bitcoin, with the equal increase in the MOVE index, which measures the implied volatility of U.S. Treasury notes. The VIX, Wall Street's so-called fear gauge, has risen by 14%. These movements, coupled with a sell-off in growth-sensitive commodity currencies like the Australian, New Zealand and Canadian dollars, are indicative of jitters in the macroeconomy, primarily driven by renewed concerns over potential Trump tariffs , prompting a rotation towards less volatile assets. ""U.S. domestic policies have become unstable, and the White House seems happy to take advantage of this instability,"" said Griffin Ardern, head of options trading and research at crypto financial platform BloFin. ""Given the challenges investors face in obtaining accurate forward-looking guidance, many are more inclined to hold low-volatility assets ... Traders need to liquidate positions to reduce their exposure to specific assets before transitioning to other markets, which explains the decline across almost all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies."" Volatility looks set to remain heightened, with President Donald Trump reportedly scheduled to speak later on Friday . In the meantime, those hoping for a significant rebound in risk assets based on personal consumption data may be disappointed because anticipated soft readings could be overshadowed by tariff concerns and rising forward-looking inflation metrics. While the outlook may seem gloomy, more positive developments could occur once the macro dust settles. Notably, this week there was progress on the regulatory front, with the SEC dropping charges against Uniswap , one of the leading decentralized exchanges, and mulling the same regarding its issues with Consensys . As Evgeny Gaevoy, CEO of leading market maker Wintermute, pointed out at Consensus Hong Kong last week, many are overlooking the evolving attitude of the SEC, and this is a factor the market has yet to fully price in. Plus, the decline in the basis in the CME bitcoin and ether futures, a sign of weakening demand, has stalled and from a technical analysis perspective, bitcoin is fast closing toward a potential demand zone.

The partnership focuses on offering crypto trading services exclusively to institutional clients, marking a significant step in DekaBank’s involvement in digital assets. This collaboration is facilitated by Boerse Stuttgart Digital, which will ensure secure access to crypto trading using its fully regulated brokerage solution. The partnership follows Boerse Stuttgart Digital Custody receiving a full license under the European Union’s new Markets in Crypto-Assets ( MiCA ) framework, which came into effect in January 2024. DekaBank, founded in 1918, has over 411.5 billion euros in assets under management and is a key player in the German asset management space. While initially skeptical about cryptocurrencies, DekaBank started its journey into the crypto world in 2023 by collaborating with the Swiss digital asset firm Metaco to create a blockchain-based tokenization platform. This move was part of DekaBank’s efforts to explore the potential of crypto assets, despite the regulatory uncertainties in different regions. DekaBank’s entry into crypto trading aligns with the European Union’s MiCA regulations, which are providing clearer guidelines for the crypto market. The move comes after Boerse Stuttgart Digital saw its crypto business generate 25% of total revenues in 2024. Boerse Stuttgart Group’s CEO, Matthias Voelkel, expressed his satisfaction with the European Union’s regulatory approach, highlighting the importance of clear, smart regulations to foster innovation in the crypto market. Voelkel also pointed to the strong market dynamics coming from the US, which have helped boost confidence in the future of digital currencies. Despite challenges in the regulatory landscape, he emphasized the need for innovation within the crypto space, especially as global dynamics evolve. Europe’s progress with MiCA and Boerse Stuttgart’s regulatory-compliant infrastructure is setting the stage for greater institutional involvement in crypto trading, especially for those operating in heavily regulated environments. DekaBank’s new venture into crypto services, facilitated by Boerse Stuttgart Digital, exemplifies how established financial institutions are adapting to the changing crypto landscape. While the US may currently lead in certain technological innovations, Europe’s regulatory framework provides a stable foundation for cryptocurrency businesses, creating an environment conducive to growth and innovation. For DekaBank, this step into crypto trading signals a commitment to integrating digital assets into its traditional asset management services. With MiCA providing clarity, institutions like DekaBank can now confidently offer crypto services, providing them with a competitive advantage. As crypto regulation evolves, Boerse Stuttgart Digital is positioned as a key player in helping financial institutions navigate this new era. The platform’s regulated infrastructure enables secure and reliable access to crypto markets, helping firms like DekaBank enter the space without compromising on compliance or security. This partnership is a reflection of Europe’s strong commitment to creating a well-regulated crypto environment, one that can rival the US in crypto adoption. By embracing MiCA regulations , Europe is paving the way for future growth in the crypto sector. As more traditional financial institutions follow DekaBank’s lead, the industry is likely to see a broader acceptance of cryptocurrencies in mainstream finance. Boerse Stuttgart’s role in this transition highlights the importance of collaboration between traditional financial services and the growing crypto market, ensuring that both sectors can thrive within a regulated framework. Ultimately, this collaboration shows that despite the challenges the crypto industry faces globally, institutions are finding innovative ways to work within regulatory guidelines to push forward in the market. The MiCA framework offers the clarity and transparency needed to boost confidence in crypto investments, particularly for institutional players. As the space continues to evolve, partnerships like the one between DekaBank and Boerse Stuttgart Digital will play a key role in shaping the future of crypto in Europe.",,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-28 12:16:36

Polkadot: Connecting Blockchains for a Faster, Smarter Future Imagine if blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin could talk without middlemen. That’s what Polkadot does. It’s a decentralized network that lets value and data move between blockchains. Using parachains, it boosts speed and scalability. It processes more transactions than Bitcoin or Ethereum. The DOT token is Polkadot’s cryptocurrency. It lets holders help run the network and rewards them for verifying transactions. Created by Gavin Wood, a co-founder of Ethereum, Polkadot launched in May 2020 aiming for a more connected blockchain future. Polkadot’s technology could change how blockchains work together. By letting networks communicate, it opens new doors for decentralized apps. In today’s market, where speed and connectivity matter, Polkadot shines. Compared to other coins, DOT solves problems that older blockchains face. As demand for efficient networks grows, Polkadot may be an attractive option. Though the crypto market is shifting, Polkadot’s strong tech gives it a solid standing now. POL: Unlocking Opportunities in the Growing Polygon Network The Polygon Ecosystem Token, or POL, is key to the expanding Polygon network. This token serves many roles within the ecosystem. Holders can stake their tokens, locking them up to support the network. In return, they earn rewards. Staking keeps the network secure. POL also lets holders vote on important decisions, giving the community a voice in the network’s future. POL opens doors to exclusive services within the Polygon ecosystem. As the network grows, the token becomes more useful. More applications and services joining the network could increase demand for POL, possibly boosting its value. In the current market, many are watching tokens like POL as the crypto space changes. While it’s important to consider all factors, POL’s role in the Polygon network makes it a token worth noting. AVAX: The Fast and Eco-Friendly Blockchain Powering the Future of Transactions Avalanche (AVAX) is a blockchain platform known for its speed and low cost. It can process up to 4,500 transactions per second, with transactions finalizing in less than two seconds. This makes it much faster than many other blockchains. Avalanche is also eco-friendly, which is important in today’s world. Users can create their own customizable Subnets, allowing for flexibility and specific needs. The platform uses a unique consensus mechanism that combines classical and Nakamoto methods for security and efficiency. It has three types of chains for different purposes, like handling transactions and running smart contracts. The AVAX token is central to the system, used for paying fees, staking to secure the network, and operating Subnets. In the current market, AVAX stands out for its strong technology and potential. Its speed and low fees make it attractive compared to other coins that can be slower or more costly. The ability to launch Subnets and create custom tokens adds value for developers and businesses. As the demand for scalable and efficient blockchain solutions grows, platforms like Avalanche could see increased use. While the crypto market can be unpredictable, AVAX’s innovative features make it a coin worth watching. Chainlink: Unlocking Real-World Potential in Blockchain Chainlink is making waves by helping smart contracts interact with the real world. It acts as a bridge, allowing these digital agreements to access data from outside their network. By using trusted sources called oracles, Chainlink ensures that the information fed into smart contracts is accurate. This means smart contracts can now respond to real events, like changes in weather or stock prices. It’s a big step forward, making blockchain technology more practical and useful. In today’s market, Chainlink stands out because it adds real value to how blockchains operate. Unlike other coins that might just offer a new way to transact, Chainlink enhances existing systems by providing reliable data connections. The LINK token is central to this process, rewarding those who supply accurate information and helping secure the network. With more applications needing dependable data feeds, especially in finance and insurance, Chainlink’s approach looks promising. Compared to other coins, LINK offers a unique solution that’s in demand, making it an attractive option in the current market cycle. Conclusion DOT, POL, AVAX, and LINK could yield significant returns, but XYZVerse (XYZ), the first all-sport memecoin, unites fans and aims for 20,000% growth.

(Sponsored),https://coinpaprika.com/news/bitcoin-bull-ico-getting-closer-to-its-3-million-target-should-you-invest-in-btcbull-,"And when that asset is BTC Bull, a project that markets itself as the best Bitcoin-based meme coin, investors should start to pay attention. A meme coin with unique bull-like imagery, BTC Bull is a project that relies less on jokes and more on airdrops and heroic memes to consolidate the community. But in a market that already has an influx of meme coins, should you invest in BTCBULL? What is BTC Bull? The official website defines BTC Bull as the official meme coin. The project is designed to ride the wave of Bitcoin's growth and offer users gains as the world's biggest crypto stampedes towards the $250K mark and beyond. Calling itself an unstoppable force that could push Bitcoin towards the $1M mark, the project aims to bring people to the top as BTC becomes the most valuable asset in the world. Beyond the narrative, however, what makes this project interesting is how it has integrated its core attributes within its core features. Earning Bitcoin Airdrops Those who hold BTCBULL tokens, the native crypto of BTC Bull, gain access to Bitcoin airdrops that will arrive when Bitcoin rises to new levels. The final airdrop will be held for the BTCBULL tokens, which will happen once Bitcoin rises to the $250K mark. Token Burn Milestones Furthering its agenda to grow besides Bitcoin, BTC Bull aims to burn a portion of its total supply through token burn events that will happen every time Bitcoin goes up by another $25K. The hope is for the buying pressure to pile on so that BTCBULL can experience a parabolic increase. Stake to Earn Much like other presales, BTC Bull has also opted for a presale staking mechanism, which will reward early buyers with passive earning. This approach could compound the gains they make from the listing pump, making BTCBULL a worthy investment. Tying the Milestones with Bitcoin's Growth As already mentioned, BTC Bull is pushing towards growth by tying the milestones to Bitcoin's rising value. Each time Bitcoin grows $25K, a Bitcoin airdrop and a token burn will be initialized at alternate times. The diagram below gives the complete layout of how the roadmap has been designed. This approach makes BTC Bull have an almost symbiotic relationship with Bitcoin. As BTC Bull's community grows, more buyers will come interested in Bitcoin, leading to Bitcoin's surge. In turn, that surge could lead to BTCBULL reaching its milestone and initiating burns to boost its value. This bi-directional growth could eventually lead to massive gains for BTCBULL and the Bitcoin community. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_LFGsPR7TA Nass Crypto is a prolific YouTuber with upwards of 1 million subscribers, who has already talked positively about this project, highlighting its potential as a new meme coin. A Look at BTC Bull's Tokenomics BTC Bull's tokenomics is interesting, especially since the total supply has similarities with Bitcoin's. There are 21 billion tokens in total. 15% of it has been allocated to the Bull fund. 15% is for the milestone burn fund, 10% is for the BTC Airdrop, 10% is for staking distribution, 10% is for exchange liquidity and the final 40% is for PR and marketing. By ensuring that a maximum amount of tokens aren't allocated to the presale, BTC Bull has made sure that people are incentivized to buy the token once it goes live on cryptocurrency exchanges. Factors that Could Lead to BTC Bull's Growth Here are some factors that could lead the BTC Bull Token to grow in value. Bull run If and when the bull run arrives, BTC Bull could potentially move up in value thanks to token burns and airdrops. Social media While BTC Bull has a healthy number of followers right now, it could experience a higher level of growth if more members join up. The new style of heroic memes can definitely help its case. https://twitter.com/BTCBULL_TOKEN/status/1888895683555680551 New meme themes A bull is an animal rarely used as a mascot of a meme coin - at least none of the top ones have it. This gives BTC Bull an opportunity to become a pioneering crypto in this new niche. Presale Since the market is volatile, people are more inclined to investing in tokens that could bring them gains easily. As a presale asset, BTC Bull may go through a listing pump. Final Words BTC Bull's value proposition comes from its indirect relation to Bitcoin and its approach to focusing on Bitcoin growth and funneling it onto itself. Not breaking any new grounds, the project pays homage to the Bitcoin community. This respectful approach makes it a worthy meme coin for investors. Furthermore, it could give a suitable entry point to Bitcoin enthusiasts who have stayed away till now due to cost concerns. So, should one invest in BTC Bull? It depends on the preference, but in the current market conditions, meme coins like this one should be considered.

SEI, TIA, and XYZ have shown remarkable resilience during challenging times. Could they be the ones to lead the next market upswing? This article delves into what sets them apart and why they might dominate the forthcoming bull run. XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. As the first-ever all-sports meme token, it’s attracting both sports fans and crypto enthusiasts, creating a unique crossover that’s gaining serious traction. With a strong presale and an engaged community, some investors are already eyeing major potential gains. More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.002 by Stage 10, with over 90% of the $7.5 million milestone already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a final presale target price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” Of course, in crypto, nothing is guaranteed, but the excitement is undeniable. Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility. By bringing together traditional sports fans and the fast-moving crypto space, XYZVerse is building something different—something with entertainment value and real engagement. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Sei (SEI) Shows Signs of Recovery Amid Market Fluctuations Sei (SEI) has been trading between $0.23 and $0.31 recently. Over the past week, the price has increased by 15.30%, indicating a possible shift in momentum. Both the 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are at $0.27, suggesting price stability over these periods. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 45.43, which is near the neutral zone, while the stochastic oscillator is at 16.69, possibly pointing towards an oversold condition. If Sei breaks above the nearest resistance level at $0.34, it could aim for the next resistance at $0.42. Achieving this would represent an increase of over 30% from its current price range. On the downside, the nearest support level is at $0.19, with a secondary support at $0.11. With many in the crypto community anticipating an upcoming altcoin season and a broader market uptrend, Sei might experience further growth. However, market conditions can change rapidly, so it’s important to stay informed and consider all factors when evaluating potential developments. Celestia (TIA) Gains Momentum with 19% Weekly Increase Celestia (TIA) has seen a strong rally in the past week, with a price increase of 19.63%. The current price ranges between $3.10 and $4.16, showing signs of renewed interest from buyers. The 10-day simple moving average is $3.81, slightly above the 100-day average of $3.61, indicating short-term bullish momentum. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 46.42, suggesting the market is neither overbought nor oversold. The low stochastic value of 11.68 points to a possible undervalued state, which could attract more buyers. If the bullish trend continues, Celestia could test the nearest resistance level at $4.61. A successful breakout above this level might pave the way toward the second resistance at $5.67, representing a potential upside of around 35% from the current upper price range. On the downside, the nearest support is at $2.49, which traders should watch in case of a pullback. With optimism around a global crypto bull run and altcoin season, Celestia has the potential to capitalize on market momentum and see significant growth in the near future. Conclusion In the current bull market, SEI and TIA show promise, but XYZ stands out by uniting sports fans in a memecoin aiming for massive growth and community engagement.
