With an 80% reduction in volatility, Chainlink shows signs of a looming breakout as Smart DEX traders ramp up their positions. Simultaneously, SUI coin has approached key support levels following a predictable downturn, leaving traders anticipating a possible rebound. Amid these market shifts, BlockDAG (BDAG) captures the spotlight. With over 500,000 users, BlockDAG’s X1 Miner App has become a viral sensation, simplifying how to mine BDAG from smartphones. This surge in activity comes just in time as the window to mine BDAG before its anticipated exchange listings begins to close, highlighting BlockDAG as a potential best crypto for 2025 . For those eyeing substantial returns, now is the time to engage before the mining rewards taper off. Over 500,000 Users Mining BDAG: Here’s Your Chance to Join The popularity of the BlockDAG X1 Miner App has skyrocketed, with the user count crossing the half-million mark as enthusiasts rush to mine BDAG directly from their phones. This method, free from the complexities of traditional mining setups, offers a straightforward path to acquiring crypto. With BDAG poised for upcoming major exchange listings, current miners are strategically positioning themselves to accumulate coins before the expected surge in demand. If you’re scouting for the best crypto for 2025 , mining BDAG now could significantly amplify your portfolio’s growth potential. The presale of BlockDAG has successfully garnered $199 million, with BDAG currently valued at $0.0248 in its 27th batch. Early adopters have witnessed a staggering 2,380% gain, with projections suggesting a potential rise to $1 by 2025. LINK Price Sees Reduced Volatility: A Precursor to Surge? LINK’s volatility has sharply decreased to 80%, drawing the attention of savvy traders who predict a significant move ahead. Historically, reduced volatility often precedes a market breakout, and Smart DEX traders are not just watching—they’re actively increasing their holdings. With notable wallets accumulating LINK, including one that previously secured a 136% return, the sentiment is bullish. As the market anticipates LINK’s next move, the rising Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) suggests an uptick in buying pressure, possibly steering LINK price towards a breakout. SUI Coin’s Price Dynamics: Testing Key Support Levels The Sui coin has traced a path consistent with predictions, falling to $3.5165 before it tested the lower support at $3.2379. This trajectory aligns precisely with prior analyses, validating a robust pattern in its price movements. Currently, traders are closely monitoring to see if SUI maintains these levels or further declines to $2.5611. The latest insights indicate that crucial resistance and support levels are still active, and there could be a turnaround if the momentum shifts. Looking forward, should the Sui coin stabilize above $5.5840, it might set the stage for a confirmed breakout. Successfully retesting the $4.40 level could propel the coin towards $5.7788 and potentially higher. If the upward trend persists, SUI could aim for successive targets at $8.1673, $9.0186, and even $12.9780. The imminent days will be pivotal in determining whether SUI is poised for a significant rebound. In Summary As LINK price shows newfound stability and potential for growth, and SUI coin navigates critical support levels, the crypto market remains on edge. Meanwhile, BlockDAG’s X1 Miner App has attracted a massive user base, poised for success as one of the best crypto for 2025 . As these developments unfold, the race to secure prime positions in the burgeoning crypto landscape is intensifying.

In a new announcement, Binance says its adding support for MyShell ( SHELL ), a protocol that allows users to create, share and own AI agents that can be used for professional and personal assistance as well as companionship.

Led by OpenAI, these powerful yet proprietary models offer users advanced applications and services for complex data analysis and human-computer interactions.

March 2025 is shaping up to be a pivotal month for several major crypto projects, with groundbreaking developments, strategic partnerships, and increased adoption fueling the industry’s momentum. The battle for dominance among blockchain networks has intensified, with the focus shifting toward real-world use cases, scalability, and decentralization. One of the most exciting projects right now is Qubetics ($TICS ) —a revolutionary blockchain platform solving the cross-border transaction inefficiencies that have plagued legacy financial systems. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies that focus solely on decentralization, Qubetics is bridging the gap between security, speed, and real-world utility, making it an appealing prospect for early buyers. Let’s explore the top five cryptocurrencies to watch this month: Qubetics, Cronos, Render, Stellar, and Celestia. 1.

The project has gained significant traction, with its presale currently in its 23rd stage, having already sold over 490 million tokens to more than 21,500 holders—raising an impressive $14.1 million. At this stage, $TICS tokens are available for just $0.0888. The crypto presale ’s strategy is structured to reward early adopters, with a 10% price increase every weekend. Analysts predict a potential surge in value, with $TICS projected to hit $0.25 at the end of the presale (a 181% ROI). Post-launch, forecasts indicate the potential for exponential growth, reaching $1, $5, or even $15 after the mainnet launch. Real-Life Impact: Cross-Border Transactions Qubetics is redefining cross-border payments, addressing challenges such as high fees, slow processing times, and centralization risks.

Notably, this comment is gaining attention in the crypto community when the market is experiencing major declines. Bitcoin Price Outlook Amid Market Fluctuations In a recent development, Kendrick reiterated his speculations that Bitcoin will hit $200,000 by the end of this year and climb to $500,000 before Donald Trump leaves office. His comments come after Bitcoin’s price dropped to a three-month low, sinking below $90,000 earlier this week. According to CoinGecko data, the cryptocurrency was trading at $86,418 earlier this week, marking a 20% decline from its all-time high of $108,786 in January. In addition, the Stanford analyst linked this decline to broader economic concerns, including uncertainty surrounding global trade tariffs and unending geopolitical tensions in regions like Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Gaza. Institutional Adoption and Regulatory Developments Furthermore, Kendrick’s recent comments also relate that institutional involvement is key to stabilizing Bitcoin and driving long-term growth. He added that conventional financial firms like Standard Chartered and BlackRock, which have introduced Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), will play a crucial role in bringing legitimacy and reducing market volatility. He also pointed out that clear regulations in the U.S. will be a driving mechanism that will strengthen the stability of digital assets in the country. This would encourage larger financial institutions to invest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Additionally, he asserted that as the clear engagement policies take shape, more U.S. banks and institutional investors will step into the crypto space, potentially leading to a more structured and secure market environment. Trump’s Influence on Crypto Growth It is necessary to add that political factors also shape Bitcoin’s future, with Donald Trump’s presidency playing a key role. After his December election victory, Bitcoin surged past $100,000 for the first time, fueled by optimism from investors who see him as pro-crypto. In January 2025, Trump signed an executive order to boost cryptocurrency adoption and create a national digital asset stockpile, reinforcing his administration’s support for the industry. Crypto firms and executives also played a major role in the 2024 election, contributing nearly half of corporate donations, with some investing tens of millions into Trump’s campaign. With strong backing from the industry, Kendrick believes Bitcoin could still hit $500,000 before Trump leaves office.

Analysts debate Ripple’s impact, with concerns over lobbying against Bitcoin. SBI VC Trade expands lending services, boosting XRP adoption and utility. Ripple’s XRP has seen price declines recently. As a result, this has led to mixed reactions from analysts. Some think the cryptocurrency is struggling due to outside factors. However, others argue it remains strong against Bitcoin (BTC). Adding another layer to the story, Japanese exchange SBI VC Trade has increased its cryptocurrency lending services, which adds more options for XRP holders Conflicting Views on Market Performance Tony Edward has pushed back against Bitcoin maximalists. Specifically, he says they are unfairly singling out XRP’s decline when the entire crypto market is experiencing a general downturn.

The body is named the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors’ Office-run Joint Investigation Unit (JIU) for Virtual Asset Crimes. The unit has been operating since 2023. But it was originally intended to function as a temporary task force. It was formed to fight what officials thought would be a short-lived spike in high-profile crypto-related fraud cases. Crypto Crime: New Unit to Tackle Fraud Cases However, the JIU has been inundated with work since its formation. And with crypto adoption and crypto-related crime on the rise in South Korea, last month, the prosecution service decided to formalize the body and grant it a certain degree of independence . A launching ceremony for the Joint Digital Asset Crime Investigation Division, held in Seoul, South Korea on February 27, 2025. (Source: Yonhap TV News/Screenshot) Per Aju News and MBC News , the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors’ Office has essentially “promoted” to the level of “formal joint investigation department.” As its name suggests, the body consists of public prosecutors. But it also comprises 11 financial regulators staffers from the Financial Services Commission and the Financial Supervisory Service. The JIU will initially have 34 full-time employees in total. Most of the staffers already have considerable experience dealing with crypto-related fraud cases. At a launching ceremony, the body vowed to investigate “unfair” crypto “practices.” These include insider trading and price manipulation cases. Since its initial inception, the body has indicted 74 people and arrested 25 individuals. A South Korean appeals court will decide next month whether the country’s main opposition leader violated election laws https://t.co/FqJPaLoKJx — Bloomberg (@business) February 26, 2025 Front-page News In recent months, the JIU’s operations became the subject of front-page news, when it began probing a suspected scam coin named Queenbee. The investigation eventually led the JIU to indict a high-profile shaman named Jeon Seong-bae, aka Geon Jin. The JIU arrested the shaman on suspicions of “handling illegal political funds from politicians and candidates” during the nation’s 2018 local elections. The unit will be led by Chief Prosecutor Park Geon-wook. His team also comprises two deputy chief prosecutors. The Southern District Prosecutors’ Office said that as crypto fraudsters become more “sophisticated, intelligent, and globalized,” it would create an “effective crime response system.” The post South Korean Prosecution Crypto Crime Unit Officially Launches appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|Legal|South Korea,EN,0,0,ASIA|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-02-27 23:30:00

California Democrat Rep. Sam Liccardo is leading the push against Trump’s meme coin, though he has insistently argued that taking aim at the president’s crypto token was not his original intention when he first ran for office. He claimed, however, that Trump’s move to release a new meme coin needed some kind of response, especially since the token’s price quickly plummeted, leaving some investors with losses. Liccardo believes President Trump’s decision to launch a meme coin was unethical and an abuse of his authority Liccardo, also a former criminal prosecutor, argued that the nation should reinstate stricter anti-corruption laws, targeting Trump’s meme çoin. According to him, Trump exploited his authority, office, and the people for his personal gain, calling the president’s actions “unethical.” He added that Trump’s token raised concerns about transparency, insider trading, and improper foreign influence, saying that even some of Trump’s supporters disapproved of the meme coin launch. Thus, he introduced legislation against the token on Thursday, the Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement, or MEME Act. Liccardo even stated he had about a dozen Democratic cosponsors backing his legislation. The bill should apply to the president, vice president, Congress members, senior executive officials, and their immediate families. Violators could face fines and up to five years in prison. The bill’s draft so far dictates that Trump will have to give up his earnings from the token’s sale. Moreover, the legislation will prevent the president, any of his family members or members of Congress from issuing or promoting securities and crypto assets like meme coins. The legislation would also introduce criminal and civil penalties and bans on some financial assets. Additionally, private investors who lose their funds on meme coins promoted by state officials will be permitted to sue. Liccardo even commented, “You need to have some enforcement mechanism and a private right of action helps to keep everybody honest.” However, the bill may fail to pass in the now Republican-controlled Congress, but he believes that the legislation will lay the groundwork for Democrats if they regain power or at least show their stance against Trump’s corruption. Trump and his family have been actively involved in several crypto projects Meme coins have long been considered risky and speculative assets, with most critics comparing them to Ponzi schemes that only profit insiders and unethical celebrities. When Trump first released his token, its price quickly surged to almost $70 before dropping to roughly $12. Nevertheless, analysts believe that the token generated millions of dollars for the launching entities before its immense price drop from its trading fees. The First Lady’s MELANIA token also saw a trajectory similar to that of Trump. It surged explosively after its launch but has since fallen from its peak days, trading at only $0.8522 . Not to mention, one of the developers involved in the MELANIA token launch was found to be tangled with the LIBRA token scandal, for which Argentine President Javier Milei is still being investigated. In addition to his and Melania’s token releases, Trump and his sons launched a decentralized crypto platform in 2024 and even supported online stores selling crypto-themed sneakers. However, the president has tried to distance himself from his family’s crypto projects and overall businesses by signing an ethics agreement that will hinder him from making outside business deals. Liccardo pushes MEME Act to curb corruption, but faces political and industry resistance The MEME Act has received backing from Reps. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). But its passage in the GOP-controlled Congress is highly unlikely. Liccardo said the bill is partly a symbolic step against corruption and a basis for action if Democrats regain state legislature control. Beyond meme coins, the legislation’s broad language captures all securities and digital assets, designed to harden loopholes for indirect profits. It also requires disclosures of foreign cryptocurrency ties, but the law presents challenges for enforcement. Mixed reactions from industry: Some crypto advocates took to social media to criticize Trump’s action as a “stunt,” while others characterized the bill as politically unviable. The proposal showcases growing scrutiny of officials’ financial conduct in financial markets. The freshman lawmaker representing Silicon Valley’s 16th District since January 2025, has positioned himself as an advocate for ethical governance with the MEME Act. Yet his party faces a great deal of scrutiny over inconsistencies in addressing financial conflicts. While a few Democrats, including progressives like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC), support banning congressional stock trading, establishment figures like former Speaker Nancy Pelosi have resisted such reforms. Pelosi’s husband, Paul Pelosi, faced criticism for trades made during the Covid-19 pandemic, including a $5 million windfall trading options in Alphabet shares in advance of a hearing on tech that she oversaw. Pelosi defended lawmakers’ right to trade in the markets, saying that some proposals were “anti-free market.” Public polls show that Americans support the limitations on what could be traded. Liccardo’s concern with meme coin regulation also underscores Democrats’ larger challenge of balancing their progressive reform aspirations with powerful financial interests.

Expert trader Raoul Pal shared a bullish comment regarding SOL price in a recent post on X. He believes the coin is at its oversold level and will likely plot a rebound soon. State of the Solana Price Considering his X account , Raoul Pal said SOL is at 2 standard deviations oversold on the log regression channel. He pointed out that Solana is showcasing the lowest Relative Strength Index (RSI) since the 2022 lows. Per the onchain data, the RSI dropped as low as 25.73 on February 26, way below the oversold level . As Pal pointed out, Solana is likely to grow significantly higher in the coming month. While he is not taking new positions at the current level, he implied that this period marks the best area to buy the dip. According to CoinMarketCap data, the price of Solana was trading for $137.16, up marginally by 0.47% in 24 hours. Although the volatility is yet to clear, SOL has recorded more than 1.2% against Bitcoin within the same period. With the current outlook, the coin has now pared off its price over the past week which has dropped by 21%. SOL Price Historical Trend in March The odds of Solana soaring in the coming month is high, as the coin has historically soared in March. Data from Cryptorank pegs the average growth rate in the price of Solana in March at 32.4%. In March 2021, SOL price jumped by 49%, complemented by a 23.2% rally in 2022. While the coin saw a 3.25% retracement, growth peaked in March 2024 when it skyrocketed by 60.8%. Solana Price Monthly Returns. Source: Cryptorank If historical trends play out again, the coin may pare off its losses over the past month, now pegged at 39.5%. Potential Growth Drivers to Watch With Coinbase’s lawsuit dismissed by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), it implies that the claim Solana is an investment contract no longer holds. Current improving regulations in the country have indirectly placed altcoins in a positive light. With the cases closed and the regulator clarifying that memecoins are not securities, innovators may re-ignite the meme hype. Notably, this marked one of the biggest catalysts that drove the coin’s price to an all-time high above $294. Ultimately, the Solana ETF hype may also continue, pushing the asset into a position for adoption by institutional investors if approved. With Franklin Templeton’s SOL ETF filing submitted to the US SEC, the participation is high, pushing the approval odds higher.

The market just witnessed a seismic event that has the entire crypto sphere buzzing. Leading on-chain analytics platform, CryptoQuant , has reported a jaw-dropping Bitcoin inflow of 6,779 BTC, valued at a staggering $573.6 million, flooding into spot exchanges within a mere hour. This sudden surge has sparked intense speculation – is this a precursor to a major market move, or just whales repositioning their assets? Let’s dive deep into the details of this intriguing development. Unpacking the Massive Bitcoin Inflow: CryptoQuant’s Alert When CryptoQuant , a trusted source for on-chain crypto analytics, raises an alarm, it’s time to pay attention. Their recent report highlights an “unusual” spike in Bitcoin inflow to exchanges. But what exactly does this mean, and why is it significant? Essentially, an inflow of Bitcoin to exchanges typically indicates an intent to sell. Traders move their BTC to exchanges to have it readily available for trading against other cryptocurrencies or fiat currencies. A large, rapid inflow, like the one CryptoQuant detected, can often precede periods of increased selling pressure and potential price volatility. Let’s break down the specifics of this substantial exchange inflow : Total Inflow: 6,779 BTC Value: $573.6 million (at the time of the report) Timeframe: Within one hour Now, let’s look at where this massive wave of Bitcoin landed. Coinbase Dominates the Bitcoin Exchange Inflow The lion’s share of this Bitcoin inflow landed on two prominent platforms: Coinbase Advanced and Coinbase Prime. Coinbase , a leading cryptocurrency exchange known for its institutional and retail client base, absorbed a significant portion of this influx. Here’s the detailed breakdown: Exchange Platform BTC Inflow Percentage Coinbase Advanced 3,355 BTC 49% Coinbase Prime 3,256 BTC 48% Bitstamp 108 BTC 1% Total 6,719 BTC 98% As you can see, Coinbase platforms accounted for a whopping 97% of the total inflow, with Coinbase Advanced and Coinbase Prime receiving nearly equal amounts. Bitstamp received a much smaller fraction. This concentration on Coinbase raises further questions – why Coinbase specifically? And what does it signal for the market? Why is a Large BTC Inflow to Exchanges Significant? Understanding the implications of a large BTC inflow is crucial for navigating the volatile crypto market. Here’s why this kind of movement matters: Potential Selling Pressure: As mentioned earlier, moving BTC to exchanges is often a precursor to selling. A large inflow suggests a significant number of holders might be preparing to liquidate their positions, potentially driving prices down. Market Sentiment Indicator: Sudden spikes in exchange inflow can reflect a shift in market sentiment. It could indicate growing bearishness or profit-taking after a price rally. Volatility Catalyst: Large inflows can inject volatility into the market. The increased supply on exchanges can lead to rapid price swings as traders react to the potential for increased selling pressure. Whale Activity: Such massive transfers are often associated with whale activity – large holders moving substantial amounts of Bitcoin. Tracking these flows can provide insights into whale strategies and potential market manipulation. Are There Alternative Explanations for the Exchange Inflow? While a large BTC inflow often points to selling pressure, it’s important to consider alternative explanations. CryptoQuant itself notes that: “Some of these deposits may be from customers using exchange custody solutions.” This is a crucial point. Here are a few alternative scenarios to consider: Custodial Services Repositioning: Exchanges like Coinbase offer custodial services to institutions and individuals. These entities might be moving funds between different custody solutions or consolidating assets on the exchange for various operational reasons, not necessarily for immediate selling. OTC Desk Transfers: Over-the-counter (OTC) desks often utilize exchanges for settlement. Large inflows could be related to OTC trades being settled on exchanges, which doesn’t always translate to immediate market selling. Internal Exchange Transfers: Exchanges themselves might be moving funds internally between different wallets or platforms for security or operational purposes. These internal movements could be misinterpreted as external inflows if not properly analyzed. Actionable Insights: Navigating Market Volatility So, what should crypto traders and investors make of this Bitcoin inflow ? Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Price Action Closely: Keep a close watch on Bitcoin’s price movement in the coming hours and days. Increased selling pressure could lead to price corrections. Track On-Chain Metrics: Continue to monitor on-chain data from platforms like CryptoQuant for further insights into exchange flows, whale activity, and other market indicators. Manage Risk: In times of potential market volatility, prudent risk management is key. Consider adjusting your portfolio allocations and using risk management tools like stop-loss orders. Stay Informed: Keep yourself updated with the latest market news and analysis from reputable sources to make informed decisions. Conclusion: Decoding the Bitcoin Exchange Inflow Mystery The sudden $573 million Bitcoin inflow to exchanges, as flagged by CryptoQuant , is undoubtedly a noteworthy event in the crypto market. While it could signal potential selling pressure and market volatility, alternative explanations like custodial repositioning and OTC transfers cannot be ruled out. The concentration of this inflow on Coinbase platforms adds another layer of intrigue to this development. As the market digests this information, close monitoring of price action and further on-chain data will be crucial to decipher the true implications of this massive Bitcoin movement.

40932328,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=135131,1740699766,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary Figure AI to Launch Astonishing Home Robot Alpha Testing in 2025,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/figure-ai-home-robot-testing/,"Get ready for a potentially groundbreaking shift in home technology! Figure AI, a robotics startup making waves, has just announced an accelerated timeline for bringing its humanoid robot into our homes. While the crypto world thrives on disruptive innovation, this development from Figure AI signals a tangible leap in robotics that could soon impact our daily lives in astonishing ways. Forget distant dreams of robot butlers – Figure is aiming to start “alpha testing” its Figure 02 humanoid robot in actual home settings as early as 2025. Let’s dive into what this means and why it’s happening sooner than many expected. Why the Accelerated Timeline for Home Robots? The Power of Helix Figure CEO Brett Adcock attributes this faster pace to their innovative “generalist” Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model, aptly named Helix. This sophisticated AI is the real engine behind Figure’s ambitious schedule. Here’s why Helix is a game-changer: Generalist Approach: Unlike narrow AI focused on specific tasks, Helix is designed to be a jack-of-all-trades. It can learn and adapt to a wider range of situations and tasks, crucial for the unpredictable nature of home environments. Vision and Language Fusion: Helix processes both visual data and natural language input. Imagine instructing your home robot with simple voice commands or showing it what needs to be done – Helix bridges the gap between human instruction and robotic action. Rapid Learning: This VLA model is built to accelerate the robot’s learning curve. The faster it can grasp new tasks, the quicker it can become truly useful in a dynamic home setting. This announcement of accelerated alpha testing comes hot on the heels of Figure unveiling Helix itself. The company’s strategic decision to move away from its publicized partnership with OpenAI in favor of proprietary AI models like Helix underscores their commitment to controlling and optimizing their AI foundation. This independence is key to driving innovation and tailoring the AI specifically for their humanoid robot ambitions. Home Sweet Home for Humanoid Robots? Figure’s Vision The idea of home robots isn’t entirely new, but Figure’s concrete timeline brings it closer to reality. We’ve even had glimpses into Figure’s home aspirations, with early lab tests showcased at their South Bay offices. Last week’s Helix reveal further illuminated these plans, showcasing videos of robots tackling various household chores – even food preparation! One particularly interesting aspect is Helix’s design to orchestrate two robots working together on a single task. This hints at a future where multiple humanoid robots might collaborate in our homes to tackle complex tasks more efficiently. Consider these potential home applications: Household Chores: From tidying up and doing laundry to cleaning surfaces and organizing spaces, home robots could alleviate the burden of everyday housework. Meal Preparation: Imagine robots capable of following recipes, preparing ingredients, and even cooking meals, freeing up your time and simplifying daily routines. Assistance for the Elderly: As populations age, humanoid robots could provide invaluable support for older adults, helping them maintain independence at home for longer. This could range from mobility assistance to medication reminders and emergency support. From Factory Floors to Living Rooms: The Robotics Journey While the allure of home robots is strong, the initial focus for most robotics companies, including Figure, has been on industrial applications. Why the detour to factories and warehouses first? Lucrative Industrial Deployment: The immediate financial returns in industrial settings are more attractive. Factories and warehouses offer structured environments where robots can perform repetitive tasks, increasing efficiency and productivity. Controlled Environments: Industrial settings are generally more predictable and safer than homes. This allows for easier testing and deployment of early-stage robotics technology. Willing Early Adopters: Companies like BMW, where Figure is piloting its systems, are willing to invest in testing and implementing robotics solutions to optimize their operations. This industrial phase is seen as a crucial stepping stone. Gaining experience and refining the technology in controlled environments like factories paves the way for the more complex and nuanced challenges of deploying humanoid robots in homes. The Unique Challenges of Home Robotics Bringing robotics into our homes is a different ballgame compared to factories. Homes are wonderfully diverse and, let’s face it, often messy! Here are some key hurdles: Challenge Description Variability: Every home is unique in layout, furniture, lighting, and clutter. Robots need to adapt to endless variations. Unpredictability: Homes are dynamic environments with people, pets, and unexpected events. Robots must navigate unpredictable situations safely and effectively. Affordability: Consumer robotics must be priced competitively to be adopted widely. Balancing advanced capabilities with affordability is crucial. Safety: Home robots must be absolutely safe to operate around humans, children, and pets. Safety protocols and fail-safes are paramount. User Experience: Robots need to be easy to use and integrate seamlessly into daily life. Intuitive interfaces and reliable performance are essential for user adoption. While Figure’s 2025 “ alpha testing ” designation implies very early-stage trials, it’s a significant leap forward. It signals that the era of home robots is inching closer, driven by advancements in AI and the relentless pursuit of innovative companies like Figure AI. What Does This Mean for the Future? Figure’s ambitious timeline for home robots , fueled by their Helix VLA model, is a clear indication of the rapid progress in the field. While widespread adoption is still some years away, the prospect of humanoid robots assisting us in our homes is becoming increasingly tangible. This development has far-reaching implications: Enhanced Quality of Life: Home robots have the potential to free up our time, reduce stress from mundane chores, and provide valuable assistance, especially for the elderly and those with mobility limitations. New Industries and Job Creation: The rise of home robotics will spawn new industries focused on robot development, maintenance, software, and related services, creating new job opportunities. Societal Impact: As robotics becomes more integrated into our lives, it will raise important societal questions about ethics, privacy, and the evolving relationship between humans and machines. Figure AI’s push towards home robots is more than just technological advancement; it’s a glimpse into a future where technology seamlessly integrates into our homes, transforming how we live and interact with our surroundings. Keep an eye on Figure – they might just be shaping the next frontier of domestic life.

Provider Account/Details: You might be redirected to the chosen provider’s interface (or an embedded window) to link your existing account or create a new one. This is where you’ll provide payment details for receiving fiat currency. KYC Verification (if needed): If it’s your first time using the provider or for larger amounts, you might be prompted to complete KYC verification as required by regulations. Confirm and Execute: Review all transaction details, including fees and exchange rates, and confirm the off-ramp transaction within the Uniswap Wallet. Transaction Processing: The chosen provider will process the conversion and initiate the fiat currency transfer to your specified payment method. Processing times vary depending on the provider and payment method. Potential Challenges and Things to Keep in Mind While this update is incredibly positive, it’s important to be aware of potential challenges and considerations: Fees: Off-ramping services always involve fees. Be sure to compare fees across providers and understand the fee structure before initiating a transaction. Fees can include transaction fees, exchange rate markups, and payment processing fees. Regulatory Compliance (KYC/AML): Fiat off-ramping is subject to regulatory scrutiny. Expect to undergo KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) verification processes with the chosen provider. This is a standard practice to comply with financial regulations. Geographic Restrictions: The availability of specific providers and fiat currencies may be limited by geographic location and regulatory restrictions. Confirm that the service is available in your region. Exchange Rate Fluctuations: Cryptocurrency prices are volatile. The exchange rate at the time of initiating the off-ramp transaction might differ slightly from the rate when the transaction is fully processed. Be mindful of potential fluctuations, especially for larger transactions. Security: While Uniswap Wallet is self-custodial, you are still interacting with third-party providers for fiat off-ramping. Ensure you are using reputable providers and practice good security hygiene when managing your accounts and transactions. The Future of DeFi and Fiat Accessibility Uniswap Wallet’s integration of fiat currency exchange is a significant step forward for the DeFi space. It addresses a critical pain point for many users – the often-complex process of moving between the crypto and traditional financial systems. By simplifying crypto to fiat conversions, Uniswap is contributing to: Mainstream Adoption: Making crypto more user-friendly and accessible is crucial for wider adoption. Fiat off-ramping removes a significant barrier for newcomers and casual users. Real-World Utility: This feature enhances the real-world utility of cryptocurrencies. It becomes easier to use crypto earnings for everyday expenses, making them more practical in daily life. DeFi Ecosystem Growth: As DeFi becomes more integrated with traditional finance, it fosters a more robust and interconnected financial ecosystem. Fiat on/off-ramps are essential infrastructure for this growth. Conclusion: Embracing a Seamless Crypto-Fiat Future The introduction of fiat off-ramping in the Uniswap Wallet is a revolutionary development. It marks a significant leap towards bridging the gap between the decentralized world of crypto and the traditional financial system. By partnering with established providers like Robinhood, Transak, and MoonPay, Uniswap is empowering users with unprecedented convenience and control over their crypto assets. This update not only simplifies the user experience but also paves the way for greater mainstream adoption and real-world application of cryptocurrencies. As the DeFi space continues to evolve, features like seamless fiat off-ramping will be instrumental in shaping a more accessible and user-centric financial future.

But don’t worry, this isn’t a retreat, but a bold leap forward! Get ready for TikTok One, a groundbreaking platform supercharged with cutting-edge AI tools , poised to redefine how brands and content creators collaborate. For those in the crypto and blockchain space, understanding these social media evolutions is crucial as marketing strategies increasingly blend with online content creation. Let’s dive into what this powerful transition means for the future of digital engagement. Why is TikTok Replacing the Creator Marketplace with TikTok One? TikTok’s Creator Marketplace, while functional, was somewhat limited in scope. Think of it as a first-generation solution. TikTok One , on the other hand, is envisioned as a comprehensive ecosystem. The move signals TikTok’s ambition to provide a more integrated and intelligent suite of tools for businesses and content creators . Here’s a breakdown of the key reasons behind this upgrade: Enhanced Functionality: Creator Marketplace was primarily a directory to connect brands and creators. TikTok One expands this to offer a broader range of services, including trend analysis, creative inspiration, and AI-driven content creation tools. AI-Powered Intelligence: The core differentiator is the deep integration of artificial intelligence. TikTok One leverages AI to offer intelligent assistance in script generation, video editing, ad optimization, and more – features absent in the original marketplace. Streamlined Workflow: By consolidating various tools and resources into a single platform, TikTok aims to simplify the campaign creation and management process for both brands and creators. Future-Proofing for Social Media Marketing: This move reflects the growing importance of AI in digital marketing. TikTok is positioning itself at the forefront of this evolution, offering tools that are not just current but also future-ready. Essentially, TikTok is moving from a simple matchmaking service to a sophisticated, AI-enhanced creative and social media marketing hub. Unpacking the Power of TikTok One’s AI Tools The real excitement around TikTok One lies in its arsenal of AI tools . These aren’t just gimmicks; they are designed to genuinely enhance the creative process and marketing effectiveness. Let’s explore some of the standout AI-driven features: Symphony Assistant: Your AI Co-Pilot for TikTok Creativity Imagine having an AI assistant specifically tailored for TikTok content creation. That’s precisely what Symphony Assistant offers. This feature helps users: Summarize Trends: Quickly grasp trending topics and themes on TikTok, ensuring your content stays relevant and timely.

Intelligent Ad Optimization: Receive AI-driven suggestions to refine and enhance ad performance, maximizing ROI. Script Generator: Develop TikTok video scripts for ads by simply providing product details, industry information, and other relevant inputs. What Happens to Existing Creator Marketplace Data? TikTok understands the importance of data continuity. Ahead of the Creator Marketplace shutdown, they are actively encouraging advertisers to migrate their valuable data. Here’s what you need to know about the transition process: Data Migration Encouraged: TikTok is urging users to transfer data from the Creator Marketplace and the TikTok Creative Challenge dashboard to TikTok One. Seamless Transition: The goal is to make the migration as smooth as possible, ensuring minimal disruption for ongoing campaigns and creator relationships. Preparation is Key: Advertisers should proactively take steps to migrate their data to ensure they can continue their activities seamlessly on TikTok One. The Benefits of TikTok One for Brands and Creators This transition to TikTok One is packed with potential benefits for both brands and content creators .

Enhanced Creativity: AI assistance can spark new ideas and push creative boundaries, leading to more innovative and impactful campaigns. Improved ROI: Smarter ad optimization and more targeted content creation can translate to better campaign performance and a higher return on investment. Data-Driven Decisions: Access to trend tracking and performance analytics within TikTok One allows for more informed and strategic marketing decisions. For Content Creators: Expanded Opportunities: TikTok One’s broader scope may lead to more diverse and lucrative collaboration opportunities with brands. Creative Empowerment: AI tools can assist creators in refining their content, experimenting with new formats, and enhancing their production quality. Streamlined Collaboration: A centralized platform simplifies the process of connecting with brands, managing campaigns, and accessing resources.

The bill is designed to address ethical concerns over conflicts of interest and the use of public office for personal gain. Although the proposal faces steep political challenges, it sparks a broader debate on transparency and accountability in digital finance. The discussion reflects growing calls for clearer regulatory boundaries in a market where politics and cryptocurrency increasingly intersect. ABC News reported Thursday that House Democrats are preparing new legislation. Led by Congressman Sam Liccardo (D-CA), they plan to introduce the Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement (MEME) Act. The bill would bar senior U.S. officials and their family members from issuing, sponsoring, or endorsing digital assets, securities, futures, and commodities—specifically in response to President Donald Trump’s recent involvement with the $TRUMP meme coin. Details of the MEME Act According to the February 27 report , Liccardo and his Democratic Party constituents plan to introduce the Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement (MEME) Act, which would prohibit top U.S. officials and their family members from profiting off cryptocurrencies. Let’s make corruption criminal again. #SipWithSam #MEMEAct pic.twitter.com/J4sRcMdXv0 — Rep. Sam Liccardo (@RepLiccardo) February 27, 2025 The MEME Act is unlikely to pass in the current Republican-controlled Congress. However, its prospects could improve if Democrats retake control in the 2026 midterm elections, potentially forcing Trump to return any profits from his namesake cryptocurrency. “Let’s make corruption criminal again,” Liccardo told reporter John Parkinson. “Our public offices belong to the public, not the officeholders—nor should they leverage their political authority for financial gain.” “The Trumps’ issuance of meme coins financially exploits the public for personal gain, and raises the specter of insider trading and foreign influence over the Executive Branch,” he added. Donald Trump Faces Meme Coin Criticism The meme coin $TRUMP debuted just days before the U.S. presidential inauguration, launching alongside $MELANIA, a token tied to now-First Lady Melania Trump. Shortly after its release, $TRUMP surged to over $74 before experiencing a sharp decline, mirroring the drop in the value of $MELANIA. According to CoinGecko , $TRUMP is down 82 percent from its all-time high last month, while $MELANIA has fallen by 93 percent. The U.S. President and First Lady have previously launched branded NFTs , continuing their involvement in Web3. Despite Trump’s crypto-friendly regulatory stance, the Trumps’ meme coins have faced criticism online and in political circles due to substantial investor losses. “Last cycle we had NFTs, so Trump sold NFTs. This cycle we have meme coins,” Variant Fund CLO Jake Chervinsky said in a January 2025 X post. “Is $TRUMP seriously a surprise to you?” Restoring Confidence in Public Service Trust in governance depends heavily on separating personal gain from political authority—a line increasingly blurred by crypto-related ventures like $TRUMP. Though Liccardo’s MEME Act faces an uphill battle, its introduction itself highlights a pressing dilemma: How much influence should politicians wield in speculative digital markets? The answer will shape not just cryptocurrency policy but the credibility of democratic institutions. Ultimately, preserving public confidence may require decisive action far beyond symbolic legislation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What ethical concerns does the proposed bill raise? The measure highlights worries about public officials potentially using their office to secure personal financial benefits through digital tokens. Such a mix of public duty and private profit could erode trust in government decision-making and blur the lines of accountability. How might restricting political involvement in meme coins affect the cryptocurrency market? By limiting political figures from endorsing or profiting from meme coins, the proposal could reduce market volatility driven by speculative hype and conflict of interest. However, some observers argue that the impact might be largely symbolic given the challenging legislative environment. Are there alternative approaches to managing conflicts of interest in political finance related to digital assets? Experts suggest that, aside from outright bans, enhanced disclosure requirements and independent oversight mechanisms could offer a path to greater transparency. These alternatives might help ensure that personal financial interests do not compromise public service, fostering a more accountable framework. What potential impact could this legislation have on public trust in government? If elected officials are seen to profit from speculative digital assets, public confidence in their commitment to serving the common good may decline. This concern fuels calls for reform, as maintaining clear boundaries between public duty and personal enrichment is essential for democratic legitimacy. How does this legislative effort fit into the larger context of cryptocurrency regulation? The proposal reflects a broader debate about the need for regulatory clarity in digital markets. By targeting practices that merge political power with speculative investments, the measure may serve as a precursor to more comprehensive rules designed to ensure that emerging financial technologies operate with greater ethical oversight.

A new bill aims to prevent top government officials, including the president, from issuing or endorsing cryptocurrencies, following concerns over the recent decline of the $TRUMP meme coin.

As investors hunt for the next big opportunity, RCOF is positioning itself as a revolutionary force in decentralized finance, offering cutting-edge technology and investor-friendly features that set it apart. The Unmatched Appeal of RCO Finance (RCOF) RCO Finance (RCOF) has captured the attention of seasoned traders and institutional investors thanks to its innovative ecosystem designed for efficiency and profitability. Unlike many other altcoins, RCOF introduces an AI-powered robo advisor that revolutionizes investment strategies. This advanced tool analyzes real-time market trends and applies machine learning to identify high-potential assets before they take off. Its predictive capabilities ensure that RCOF investors stay ahead of the curve, making it one of the top altcoins to hold in the coming months. Beyond AI-driven trading, RCOF offers unparalleled accessibility. The platform’s no-KYC policy ensures privacy-focused transactions, making it a go-to choice for investors who value anonymity. Security remains a top priority, with comprehensive smart contract audits conducted by the reputable blockchain security firm SolidProof.

Investors gain exposure to over 120,000 tradable instruments, including tokenized real-world assets such as real estate, commodities, stocks, and bonds. This diversification allows RCOF holders to mitigate risks while maximizing their investment potential, further solidifying its position as one of the top altcoins to hold in March 2025.

These features make RCO Finance more than just another altcoin; it’s a comprehensive investment solution that caters to both short-term traders and long-term investors. RCOF incorporates deflationary mechanisms designed to enhance its value over time. The platform actively burns unsold tokens during its presale stages, reducing overall supply. This strategic approach boosts long-term price appreciation, making it a standout option among the top altcoins to hold in 2025. Recent developments have only added to RCOF’s momentum. The platform’s beta launch was met with overwhelming enthusiasm, attracting over 10,000 new users. With its upcoming alpha release, RCO Finance plans to introduce additional enhancements, including an advanced monitoring tool for its AI Robo Advisor.

So far, over $13.5 million has been raised, with the next price phase at $0.13 rapidly approaching. Investors who secure their positions now benefit from significant price appreciation upon listing. Market analysts project that RCOF could trade between $0.40 and $0.60 post-listing, presenting an ROI of over 800% for early adopters. Some forecasts even anticipate a 19,000% price surge, elevating RCOF to the ranks of the most profitable altcoins in recent history. Furthermore, RCOF holders gain access to exclusive perks, including AI-powered analytics, DeFi lending services, trading fee discounts, and governance rights within the ecosystem.

There’s a direct line from the efficient markets theory of Eugene Fama in the 1960s to modern portfolio theory. It paved the way for index funds, a strategy that has not only weathered market cycles but also become the default for managing pensions and retirement accounts. As we step into a new era of digital finance, tokenized assets may offer a way to broaden our investment horizons in ways that traditional models have overlooked. The genesis of modern portfolio theory Index fund investing didn’t arise by chance. In the early 1970s, amid vigorous debates over market efficiency, Burton Malkiel’s seminal work advocating index funds in 1973 (in his book “A Random Walk Down Wall Street” ) was embodied in John Bogle’s launch of the Vanguard S&P 500 fund in 1975. This cemented a strategy that focused on broad diversification and minimal trading. Astonishingly, passive index-investing has triumphed around the world, even though the theory underpinning it, that investors are always rational, hasn’t held up well. Behavioral psychologists like Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky illuminated the flaws in our decision-making processes. This is highlighted in Daniel Kahneman’s award winning book, “Thinking Fast and Slow.” In the ensuing decades, economists have reconciled efficient markets and irrational behavior into the concept of “pretty good markets.” Aggregated wisdom in the form of prices trends towards being right, over time, though from day to day and case to case there are significant gaps that investors can exploit. Index funds have held up well because exploiting those opportunities is hard to do consistently or cheaply. At the same time, the regulatory framework governing institutional investing reinforces this reliance on proven strategies. Fund managers operate under strict fiduciary duties that require them to prioritize client interests and mitigate risk. As a result, they allocate the bulk of their portfolios to assets with long, established track records, typically government bonds and passive equity funds. In short, the criteria for “acceptable” investments aren’t driven solely by potential returns; they are fundamentally tied to data history, reliability, and transparency. In case you were wondering, that means index funds. In this environment, venturing into uncharted territory is not taken lightly. New asset classes, no matter how promising, are initially sidelined because they lack the long-term, daily data that makes them viable for inclusion in a fiduciary portfolio. Until now, almost all portfolio theory has been based on U.S. equities and government bonds. Although that universe has expanded over time to include index funds and bonds from other large economies, it still represents only a relatively small portion of the world’s assets. Portfolios are constrained at the intersection of regulations and data. And that’s all going to change. Tokenization: Expanding the universe of investable assets Tokenization and on-chain transactions don’t just offer a scalable way to package any kind of asset. They also offer a path to transparent, comparable data on asset values. By representing real-world assets, whether it’s Thai real estate, Nigerian oil leases, or New York taxi medallions as digital tokens on a blockchain, we can begin to generate the kind of daily, market-derived data that has traditionally been reserved for a narrow set of assets. Consider a simple question: How much Thai real estate should feature in a diversified retirement portfolio? Under current models, the answer is obscured by a lack of reliable, continuous pricing data. But if Thai real estate were tokenized, establishing an on-chain market with daily closing prices, it could eventually be measured against the same metrics used for U.S. equities. In time, this would force a re-examination of the static, index-based approach that has dominated investment strategy for so long. The implications for global finance Right now, alternative strategies – as pension fund managers refer to anything that isn’t a stock or bond index – comprise no more than 15–20% of most funds. Changing academic data on investment options would put the other 80% up for grabs. Imagine a future where a truly diversified portfolio isn’t limited by the confines of traditional equity and debt markets. With tokenization, investors from large institutional funds to individual savers could gain exposure to asset classes and geographic regions previously ignored due to data scarcity or illiquidity. The principles that underpin modern portfolio theory wouldn’t be discarded. Rather, they would be expanded upon to include a broader range of risk and return profiles. As tokenized assets build track records, fiduciaries, who today favor the predictability of bonds and index funds, might find themselves compelled to recalibrate their strategies. It’s not that the pretty good market hypothesis will be rendered obsolete. Instead, the parameters of what constitutes “efficient” may widen considerably. A richer dataset could lead to better-informed risk assessments and, ultimately, to portfolios that capture a more accurate picture of global value. A Measured but inevitable shift This isn’t going to happen overnight. The fastest we’re likely to see changes emerge is about a decade, assuming time to build a wide portfolio of tokenized assets and 5-7 years to build a daily information track record. Once the data is present, however, change could come quickly, thanks to widespread use of artificial intelligence. One thing that often slows the spread of change is a lack of intellectual bandwidth on the part of fund managers and consumers to adapt to new data. It took about 40 years to move pension fund investors from a 95%+ bonds model in the 1950s to a majority equity index fund model in the 1990s. It took about 30 years for index funds to become the dominant equity investment vehicle after the evidence showed they were the best option. In a world of AI-driven automated investment tools, the transition might happen a whole lot faster. And with hundreds of trillions of dollars in assets under management, every percentage point change in allocation strategy is a little tsunami of change by itself.

The feature is facilitated through integrations with MoonPay, Robinhood, and Transak. This development will simplify the conversion of digital assets into fiat currency, improving accessibility for users in over 180 countries. Uniswap Labs Integrates Robinhood, MoonPay for Crypto-to-Bank Transfers In a recent post on X, Uniswap Labs announced the rollout of its fiat off-ramp feature, enabling users to convert crypto holdings into cash and withdraw funds directly into their bank accounts. This service is integrated with Robinhood, MoonPay, and Transak, providing a streamlined process for users looking to move between crypto and traditional finance. The new off-ramp is available in over 180 countries, broadening UNI platform’s global reach. The feature is accessible through the Uniswap wallet on both iOS and Android. More so, there are plans to extend support to the UNI platform browser extension and website. By integrating with multiple fiat on-ramp providers, Uniswap Labs will offer a flexible way for users to manage crypto transfers. Users can swap supported ERC-20 tokens, including USDC and ETH, before withdrawing their converted funds to bank accounts. According to Uniswap, the process is designed to be completed in seconds, reducing delays commonly associated with crypto-to-bank transfers. The integration with Robinhood, MoonPay, and Transak ensures broad coverage across different regions, increasing accessibility. This move comes just days after the US SEC dropped its Uniswap case, marking another shift in the regulator’s approach to the crypto industry. The UNI platform stated that the case closure reaffirms its compliance with federal laws and its commitment to a transparency. Expansion of Features With Unichain The fiat off-ramp follows the UNI platform recent introduction of Uniswap v4 and Unichain, a Layer 2 network designed to improve scalability. These updates will offer users more efficient trading and transaction capabilities. Uniswap v4 introduces customizable hooks, which allow developers to create more efficient trading strategies on the platform. Meanwhile, Unichain Layer 2 is expected to reduce gas fees and improve transaction speeds, boosting UNI price with new technologies. Uniswap Labs move comes as other crypto wallets, such as MetaMask, expand their fiat off-ramp services. MetaMask recently integrated with Transak to support fiat withdrawals across multiple blockchains. This reflects a growing trend among DeFi platforms to bridge the gap between crypto and traditional banking.

However, it faces its toughest challenge amidst falling network activity and a price slump. According to an analyst, Dogecoin experienced a massive 95% drop in active addresses on its network, suggesting a considerable decline in activity.

As Dogecoin’s price starts to recover, its network activity suffered. Crypto expert Ali Martinez notes the decline in the network activity, sharing that the drop in the number of active addresses began three months ago. According to Martinez, the Dogecoin network registered 1,292,770 new active addresses by November 21st, 2024. The number soon surged to 2.4 million active addresses, but this number immediately dropped. Between December 2024 and February 2025, the number of addresses dropped by around 95%. Meanwhile, Dogecoin’s price has declined substantially in the last few days, with holders incurring losses. The popular meme coin is currently trading at $0.2077, a slight improvement from its $0.1977 price a few hours ago. Despite DOGE’s minimal gains, it’s still down from last week’s performance. Drop In Network Activity On February 23rd, it was noted that the network only had 30,815 new addresses, confirming the slide in network activity. The decrease in Dogecoin’s network activity was reflected in its price movement, which dipped from $0.4868 to $0.196. With price dipping and a decline in network activity, many commentators argued it’s a sign of weak demand for Dogecoin. According to one data, there’s a 2.67% decline in the percentage of long-term Dogecoin investors, which means a less accumulation. Also, there’s a drop of 11.81% in mid-term coin holders, meaning they have already exited their positions. Finally, the data indicates a 107.45% increase in short-term holders, which suggests an increase in speculative trading. This information shows that Dogecoin traders are more interested in short-term and speculative trading activities than long-term investment. DOGE is starting its big move!

Whales Buy 530 Million DOGE appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Amid the ongoing bearish price momentum, Dogecoin (DOGE), the largest and most popular meme coin, has been gaining significant attention from crypto enthusiasts due to its notable price drop in recent days. Crypto Whales Buy 530 Million DOGE On February 28, 2025, a prominent crypto expert shared a post on X (formerly Twitter), revealing that during the past three days of DOGE’s price decline, whales have bought the dip, accumulating a significant 530 million DOGE. https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1895217845186724299 DOGE’s on-chain data shows that it has experienced a price drop of over 17% during the period when whales bought the dip. It appears that they began accumulating after the breakdown of the crucial support level at $0.238. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Action and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, DOGE appears bearish but has been consolidating in a tight range near the crucial support level of $0.175 for the past two trading days. Based on recent price action and historical patterns, DOGE still seems bearish and could drop another 15% in the future. Source: Trading View As of now, the asset is trading below the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe, indicating a downtrend. Current Price Momentum and Decline of Open Interest DOGE is currently trading near $0.206 and has experienced a modest price surge of over 1.75% in the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, its trading volume dropped by 30%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors, possibly due to the significant price fluctuations the meme coin has witnessed in recent days. With the bearish market outlook, data from the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass revealed that intraday and derivative traders appear to be abandoning DOGE, as its futures open interest (OI) has dropped to its lowest level in 2025.

The meme coin market is boiling with action, and traders are scrambling to get in before the next explosion. Apu Apustaja (APU) is feeling the heat, dropping 22.29% in the past week, despite a 7.27% increase in trading volume. Meanwhile, Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) is making waves, climbing 10.26% in just seven days, catching the attention of meme coin degens. But the real spotlight is on BTFD Coin (BTFD), where whales are aping in fast thanks to its 90% APY staking rewards and a massive 3650% ROI potential. With a presale tally of $6.21M and over 11,100 holders, BTFD Coin is dominating the meme coin conversation. Let’s break down why this meme-fueled rocket might be the best meme coin to buy today . BTFD Coin (BTFD) – 90% APY Staking and a 3650% ROI Potential Why are investors rushing to grab BTFD before it moons? Simple—this isn’t just another meme coin, it’s a whole movement. The Bulls Squad, now over 11,100 strong, is laser-focused on staking rewards, play-to-earn (P2E) gaming, and a 3650% ROI moonshot. It’s no wonder why BTFD Coin is dominating discussions as the best meme coin to buy today. The 90% APY staking feature is a game-changer. Investors aren’t just holding BTFD; they’re multiplying their stacks at an insane rate. Staking offers passive income, meaning even before the price skyrockets post-listing, holders are raking in rewards. Now, let’s talk numbers. If an investor drops $2,000 into BTFD at the current presale price of $0.00016, they’d be holding 12.5 million BTFD tokens. Once BTFD hits $0.0006 at listing, that bag would be worth $7,500—nearly 4x the investment before even factoring in staking rewards. And if BTFD blasts to its projected $0.006 moon price, that’s a 3650% ROI, turning $2,000 into a jaw-dropping $75,000. It’s easy to secure BTFD before the presale price jumps. Set up MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load it with BNB, ETH, or USDT, and head to the presale page . Enter the amount of BTFD you want, apply the 100% BONUS CODE (LAUNCH100) to double your tokens, confirm the purchase, and boom—you’re officially part of the Bulls Squad. But here’s where it gets even crazier: BTFD skipped Stage 13, burning all unsold tokens. With a tightening supply and skyrocketing demand, this presale is heating up fast. If you’re still on the sidelines, now’s the time to act—this is hands down the best meme coin to buy today. Apu Apustaja (APU) Sees Volume Surge Despite Price Drop Apu Apustaja, the Pepe-variant meme coin, has had a rough week, dropping 22.29%. However, its trading volume has jumped 7.27%, showing that traders are still keeping an eye on it. Despite its price dip, Apu Apustaja has a loyal community of investors who believe in its long-term value. Unlike low-effort meme coins that get rugged, APU’s fully transparent and fairly launched nature has kept holders engaged. With its fair launch philosophy and organic meme appeal, Apu Apustaja remains a wild card in the meme coin space. Whether it bounces back or consolidates further will depend on its next market moves and how its community rallies. Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) Pumps 10.26% and Gains Market Momentum Fartcoin might have started as a joke, but its recent performance is no laughing matter. The coin has seen a 10.26% price surge in just one week, backed by a 0.76% increase in trading volume. Built on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain, Fartcoin has been picking up steam in the DEX space, where traders are swapping it aggressively. Some early adopters are already seeing solid gains, making it one of the most talked-about meme coins this week. Fartcoin’s real strength lies in its growing trader base and memetic power. As long as it keeps its momentum, it could remain a trending pick for meme coin degens looking for short-term flips. The Final Thoughts Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin stands out as the best meme coin to buy today. While Apu Apustaja battles price volatility and Fartcoin gains short-term traction, BTFD’s 90% APY staking and 3650% ROI potential make it the most compelling investment opportunity right now. The Stage 14 price of $0.00016 won’t last much longer, and with BTFD set to list at $0.0006, this is the perfect dip to buy before it takes off. The 100% BONUS CODE (LAUNCH100) won’t be around forever—this is a limited-time chance to double your tokens and secure a front-row seat for BTFD’s moon mission.

Founding members of HumanAIx include: OORT, Neo, Storj, Oasis Protocol, YGG, io.net, XYO, AI.KIDO, DeTaSECURE, Unyt, Holo, Valdi, Supermoon. As AI advances rapidly, the three core pillars of AI development—compute, storage, and data—continue to face significant challenges including high costs, energy consumption, scalability limitations, and centralization, which restrict accessibility and efficiency. On the storage side, handling large data volumes and associated transfer costs continues to be a challenge. Meanwhile, data acquisition often raises ethical and legal concerns, with frequent violations of privacy rights. Data labeling further exacerbates the issue, relying on underpaid workers in poor working conditions, creating serious human rights concerns. Additionally, individuals who contribute data rarely receive fair compensation or incentives. Overcoming these challenges is important for the industry's long-term sustainability and ethical development. HumanAIx is an open protocol that seamlessly connects partners—each contributing critical components such as validation, storage, compute, and data—to create a decentralized AI infrastructure that is permissionless, scalable, and verifiable. It is built on a three-layer architecture, consisting of an interface layer, a protocol layer (which integrates compute, storage, and data), and a security layer. This initiative harnesses industry expertise and knowledge to collaboratively build an open environment for the future of decentralized AI. ""We believe AI should create more benefits than constraints for humanity. With the launch of HumanAIx, we are fostering a decentralized movement to ensure AI remains human-centric and serves the broader community,"" said Michael Robinson, Chairman of OORT Foundation. ""We are thrilled to collaborate with like-minded visionaries and excited to develop initiatives that better serve the AI community, ultimately building a truly human-centric ecosystem."" ""At Neo, we believe that a decentralized, interoperable future is key to unlocking AI’s full potential. By joining HumanAIx, we are contributing to an open, verifiable AI infrastructure that empowers developers and businesses alike—one that is transparent, scalable, and accessible to all,"" said John Wang, Head of Neo Ecosystem Growth. “This HumanAIx marks a significant milestone in democratising access to high-quality AI models and incentivising human contribution in AI. By combining OORT’s robust infrastructure with our security expertise at DeTaSECURE and EigenLayer’s innovative restaking mechanism, we’re creating an ecosystem that ensures transparency, reliability and economic sustainability in AI industry.”said Tamaghna Basu, Founder, CEO & CTO of DeTaSECURE. ""The future of AI depends on diverse, high-quality human input, and YGG is joining HumanAIx to ensure that AI is built with—and for—real people. By empowering a global community to refine and enhance AI data in a decentralized way, we’re creating new opportunities for digital work while keeping AI open, fair, and aligned with human interests."" said Beryl Li, Co-Founder of YGG. ""At XYO, we are driven by the vision of blending blockchain, data and AI to unlock human potential in meaningful ways. HumanAIx offers a unique opportunity to foster collaboration and build systems that prioritize fairness, authenticity, and real-world impact while ensuring data integrity. We’re proud to join forces with forward-thinking partners to shape a future where technology amplifies human agency and innovation thrives."" said Markus Levin, XYO Co-Founder. “While everyone is just talking about ‘Bring AI to people’, ‘Make Web3 AI truly decentralized’, HumanAIx has a real impact by uniting the brightest minds of the web3 AI sector. By stepping into this alliance with AI.KIDO we're significantly boosting our efforts to put the responsibility for AI markets into the hands of real people.” said Pavlo Karapinka, Co-Founder of AI.KIDO. “We are impressed with the collaborative and human-centric approach to AI taken by HumanAIx. It’s imperative that AI develops as a tool for all and by all, and this initiative is a unique opportunity to make this goal a reality. We are excited to work closely with our partners to build and realise the vision of this open ecosystem.” said Alastair Ong, Director at Holo.

While institutional investors are increasingly backing Bitcoin, not every investor is focused solely on BTC for substantial returns. Yet, not all investors are focusing on BTC— Web3Bay is quickly becoming the center of attention. While Bitcoin leads the market, Web3Bay’s rise is stealing the spotlight. The decentralized e-commerce platform raised $200,000 within 24 hours, marking a milestone in its presale. With rapid sales and a unique Web3 model, Web3Bay stands out as one of the top altcoins to buy now, showing massive potential in 2025. Bitcoin’s Gains Strength With Strategy₿’s Bullish Bet Bitcoin’s jump above $95,000 marks a solid comeback after losses caused by the LIBRA coin crash, which erased $4.4 billion in market value. Despite setbacks, Bitcoin remains the strongest crypto, with institutions rapidly increasing their holdings. On February 18, 2025, Michael Saylor, executive chairman of Strategy₿ (formerly MicroStrategy), revealed the company’s $2 billion private offering. Raised through convertible senior notes due in 2030, the funds will buy more Bitcoin and support long-term growth. Saylor highlighted Bitcoin’s growing role in corporate finance, comparing its value to high-end real estate. He noted that Bitcoin is no longer just a speculative asset but a core part of Strategy₿’s expansion strategy, even using BTC as collateral for new projects. With institutions strengthening their Bitcoin positions, analysts see this as a signal of long-term growth, suggesting that the current dip offers a chance to buy. However, as Bitcoin’s growth slows, many retail investors are turning to Web3Bay for faster gains. Web3Bay Raises $200K in 24 Hours— Is it the Next Market Giant? While Bitcoin rebounds, Web3Bay is capturing attention with its rapid growth. The decentralized e-commerce platform raised over $200,000 in a single day, pushing its presale total past $1.5 million as buyers rush to secure early-stage gains. Web3Bay aims to transform online shopping by cutting out middlemen, lowering costs, and giving users full control over their transactions. Unlike Amazon, eBay, and Shopify, which charge high fees and control user data, Web3Bay offers direct blockchain-based transactions. This real-world use case is fueling Web3Bay’s fast-selling presale. As interest in decentralized commerce grows, Web3Bay is positioned to lead the market. Now in Stage 4 of its presale, the 3BAY coin is priced at $0.004562. With each stage bringing a price increase, early buyers are locking in gains before the next jump. The rising demand and fast funding suggest Web3Bay could become one of the biggest success stories of the next bull run. Why Smart Investors Are Choosing Web3Bay Bitcoin remains a strong choice for long-term growth, but its large market cap limits its speed. While institutional adoption boosts its stability, it doesn’t offer the rapid gains that retail investors seek. This is why many are turning to Web3Bay, which offers both real-world use and high early-stage growth potential. First, Web3Bay’s presale gives buyers a chance to enter at low prices before demand drives up the cost. Unlike Bitcoin, which has already reached a trillion-dollar market cap, Web3Bay is still in its growth phase, offering more room for fast gains. Second, Web3Bay is solving real industry challenges, unlike short-lived meme coins. With more people seeking decentralized shopping, demand for 3BAY coins is expected to rise as the platform grows. Lastly, Bitcoin’s biggest gains are in the past, while Web3Bay is just beginning. Early Bitcoin buyers made life-changing profits, and Web3Bay now offers a similar early-stage opportunity. Time to Take Decision! Bitcoin’s rebound and Strategy₿’s $2 billion purchase show that institutional support for crypto is still strong. But for faster short-term gains, Web3Bay is emerging as a top choice. With $200,000 raised in 24 hours and a presale total above $1.5 million, Web3Bay is growing faster than most new projects in 2025. While Bitcoin is well-established, Web3Bay’s early phase gives buyers the best chance to lock in big returns before prices climb further. The next breakout crypto is here—get in before Web3Bay’s crypto presale stages sell out.

40934881,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=320395,1740704441,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/dailyhodl.png,Economist Alex Krüger Says Current Bitcoin Setup Looking Like Replica of Early 2024 – Here’s His Forecast,https://dailyhodl.com/2025/02/27/economist-alex-kruger-says-current-bitcoin-setup-looking-like-replica-of-early-2024-heres-his-forecast/,"A closely followed economist thinks that Bitcoin ( BTC ) may be repeating a similar pattern from last year and still has room to run to the upside. Alex Krüger tells his 206,800 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin’s latest severe correction is similar to when the flagship crypto asset collapsed to range lows in April 2024 before printing a series of rallies. However, he warns that the uncertainty around US President Donald Trump’s tariff polices remains a big risk for the crypto markets. “The dominant mood across crypto market participants is ‘it is over.’ For good reason. The Bitcoin dip is large, yet not extraordinary. But across alts the destruction is real. That said, I see this BTC chart as a replica of early 2024. Range lows are meant to be taken out (check the early 2024 range). Do need the Donald not to nuke us. The trigger for the last move down was precisely tariffs news (on Canada and Mexico).” Krüger also says Bitcoin may still hit lower price targets before rallying. “BTC is bottom of the range, akin to April 30th, 2024 in my opinion. Maybe we go lower, maybe we bounce. Don’t know, but it’s a good spot regardless.” He notes that severe Bitcoin corrections occur multiple times a year, and may present buying opportunities. “One can make a living just from getting good at buying liquidations. We get two-four such liquidations a year.” The economist previously said that investors should zoom out because he thinks crypto is amid a supercycle, which could include painful Bitcoin pullbacks. “BTC is stuck in a range, which I think eventually resolves higher. The supercycle theory is intact. Even though it applies to Bitcoin and crypto as a whole (market cap ex BTC and stables is considerably higher), most old alts don’t benefit from it on a sustained basis. Should not expect an insane wave of liquidity driving all cr*p higher for an extended period of time. Be selective.” Bitcoin is trading for $84,608 at time of writing, down 4.8% in the last 24 hours.

With major coins experiencing sharp declines, traders are now eyeing emerging projects that could offer substantial returns. The question is, where should one place their bets? Dogecoin (DOGE) has dropped significantly, shaking investor confidence, while Pepe Coin is struggling with high volatility. But amidst the downturn, one memecoin is making waves— Arctic Pablo Coin (APC). With a powerful presale structure, strong tokenomics, and a growing community, APC is positioning itself as the best crypto to buy now. This article will cover the latest developments in Arctic Pablo Coin (APC), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Pepe Coin (PEPE). Arctic Pablo Coin: The Strategic Tokenomics Powering Its Rise Tokenomics is the backbone of any cryptocurrency, and for Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC), it’s a game-changer. With a total supply of 221.2 billion APC, its structure is designed for long-term value and sustainability. The presale allocation rewards early adopters, while unsold tokens are strategically burned, ensuring supply control and potential price appreciation. Staking rewards are another major highlight, incentivizing holders to participate actively. This structure is not just about speculation—it’s about building a lasting ecosystem that thrives beyond the initial hype. Arctic Pablo Coin’s best crypto to buy now status comes from its carefully crafted supply model, ensuring that early investors benefit from controlled distribution and strategic growth mechanisms. Penguinopolis: The Arctic Pablo Presale is Entering an Exciting Phase! The Arctic Pablo Coin presale has reached Penguinopolis, the 12th phase, and the excitement is undeniable. Currently priced at $0.000067 per APC, early investors are looking at a potential 11,844.78% ROI when it hits the listing price of $0.008. With over $1.62 million already raised, the momentum is building rapidly. Each new phase marks a price increase, meaning every delay could mean missing out on massive potential gains. Penguinopolis isn’t just a stop—it’s a crucial turning point for those looking to enter at an optimal price. As the price continues its upward trajectory, those who act now could secure one of the most lucrative opportunities in the meme coin space. For anyone looking for the best crypto to buy now, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale offers a rare chance to get in before it reaches the mainstream spotlight. Dogecoin Faces a Steep Decline—Investors Seek Alternatives Dogecoin (DOGE) is experiencing a significant downturn, leaving investors uncertain about its future. Currently down nearly 40% this month, DOGE has slipped to $0.208 as of February 26—its lowest point since December. The downturn is driven by waning interest and the overall market slump, particularly Bitcoin’s recent dip below $90,000, dragging down altcoins like DOGE. Analysts warn that if the trend continues, DOGE could see further declines, possibly touching $0.20. With a negative sentiment surrounding its price action, many investors are exploring new projects that could deliver better returns. Pepe Coin: A Rapid Rise, But Can It Sustain the Momentum? Pepe Coin has been a sensation in the meme coin world, quickly climbing to a $1.6 billion market cap shortly after launch. With its strong community and meme-driven appeal, it initially seemed unstoppable. However, the typical challenges of meme coins—high volatility, lack of utility, and weak adoption—are now catching up with it. Experts predict that Pepe’s price, currently at $0.000009, could decline soon as investor sentiment shifts. Pepe Coin’s long-term viability remains uncertain with traders looking for projects with stronger fundamentals. As a result, some investors are already exploring newer, more structured opportunities in the meme coin space. Conclusion: The Memecoin Market is Changing—Arctic Pablo Coin Leads the Charge With Dogecoin struggling and Pepe facing uncertain prospects, the memecoin market is in flux. But instead of signaling the end, this shift presents a golden opportunity for new projects to take center stage. Arctic Pablo meme coin presale , currently at Penguinopolis with a price of $0.000067, stands out as a prime investment. With strategic tokenomics, staking incentives, and a growing community, APC is shaping up to be the best crypto to buy now. Don’t wait until it’s too late—Arctic Pablo Coin’s journey is just beginning, and those who get in now could see exponential gains. For More Information: Arctic Pablo Coin: https://www.arcticpablo.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/ArcticPabloOfficial Twitter: https://x.com/arcticpabloHQ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What makes Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) the best crypto to buy now? Arctic Pablo Coin offers a structured presale, strategic tokenomics, and strong staking incentives, making it a standout investment. With its price currently at $0.000067 in the Penguinopolis phase, early investors can secure high potential returns. How does Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale work? The APC presale moves through multiple phases, with each phase increasing the price. The current phase, Penguinopolis, marks one of the last low-price opportunities before the final listing at $0.008. Why is Dogecoin struggling in 2025? Dogecoin has seen a nearly 40% drop this month due to declining trader interest and a general market downturn. Its lack of strong fundamentals is causing investors to look for alternative meme coin opportunities. Is Pepe Coin still a good investment? Pepe Coin gained massive popularity but faces high volatility and no clear long-term adoption. With its price currently at $0.000009, experts predict it could drop further, prompting investors to seek projects with more structured growth potential. How high can Arctic Pablo Coin go after its presale? Based on its listing price of $0.008, early investors in the current Penguinopolis phase at $0.000067 could see an ROI exceeding 11,844.78%. Its staking rewards and controlled supply model further support strong post-listing performance.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $4.66 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $14.78. Tezos started out really strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Following the November 5 U.S. elections and the emergence of ex-president Donald Trump, crypto markets have responded positively, with Bitcoin prices moving above the $100k mark. Tezos also responded similarly, hitting a high of $1.85. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $0.752 Market cap $776,038,568.52 Trading volume $24,372,160.31 Circulating supply 1,032,312,440.52 XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3146 on December 7, 2018 24-hour low $0.7414 24-hour high $0.7853 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 9.54% 50-day SMA $1.044 14-Day RSI 29.66 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 10 (Extreme Fear) Green days 15/30 (50%) 200-day SMA $0.9629 Tezos price analysis: Will XTZ surge past $0.85 soon? TL; DR Breakdown XTZ has lost 0.70% in the last 24 hours. The coin’s support is at $0.748, and resistance is around $0.792. Tezos faced rejection at $0.787. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart: XTZ to surge past its 20-day SMA soon? The daily price analysis of the Tezos (XTZ) coin on February 28 shows consolidation in the last trading hours. XTZ’s value is currently around $0.75, having faced rejection at $0.787. XTZ to surge past its 20-day SMA soon? The MACD indicator, with a bearish crossover, also confirms the selling signal observed on the chart. The RSI (36.28) reflects a market approaching oversold conditions, suggesting buying opportunities at a discount. If buyers reenter the market, XTZ could surge past its 20-day SMA at $0.856. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart: XTZ appears range-bound The 4-hour chart shows recovery for XTZ, with the coin approaching the middle Bollinger Band, although resistance remains intact at $0.770. The Bollinger Bands are tightening, suggesting reduced potential volatility in the short term and possible price consolidation. XTZ appears range-bound The CMF indicator hovering around zero shows a neutral market, supporting the chances of XTZ consolidating. Meanwhile, the MFI also suggests oversold conditions, indicating ongoing cash outflow. If XTZ fails to stay above $0.748, it might move toward lower support levels. To confirm a recovery, XTZ must break above $0.770. Tezos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.9468 SELL SMA 5 $0.9123 SELL SMA 10 $0.9240 SELL SMA 21 $0.9018 SELL SMA 50 $1.0443 SELL SMA 100 $1.2125 SELL SMA 200 $0.9629 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.9246 SELL EMA 5 $0.9980 SELL EMA 10 $1.1126 SELL EMA 21 $1.2210 SELL EMA 50 $1.2529 SELL EMA 100 $1.1481 SELL EMA 200 $1.0276 SELL What to expect from XTZ price analysis next? Tezos (XTZ) is down to about $0.756 and looks oversold, which might mean a short-term bounce. But overall, it’s still in a bearish trend. If it breaks above $1.25, it could turn bullish, but if not, it might keep dropping. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs – so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your own research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Why is Tezos down? Tezos (XTZ) is down today after facing rejection at the $0.7616 resistance level, a move spurred by selloffs. XTZ price history Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $2 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications.

Tezos historic price sentiment Tezos price history ⏐ Source: Coinmarketcap Tezos mainnet went live in September 2018 and immediately gained popularity for dealing with the environmental impact of blockchain technologies at that time with its PoS model. XTZ’s price peaked during the bullish cycle of 2021, reaching above $9.0. After 4 April 2022, XTZ’s price plummeted below $4.0; by 9 May, it had sharply fallen below the $2 mark. XTZ surged to about $1 at the beginning of December 2022, but the bears reclaimed the market by the end of the month, resulting in a drop to $0.73. The coin made some recovery in 2023, averaging a market price of $0.8. Tezos (XTZ) had a largely bearish 2024 despite the partnership milestones achieved. The coin reached a high of $1.4 in April but lost about 60% by August. The bulls soon entered the market, and XTZ saw renewed buyer interest, which resulted in a peak price of $0.7015 in September and $1.856 in November. The surge extended into December—Tezos XTZ recorded a maximum price of $1.909. Price corrections followed thereafter, and the coin closed the year at $1.286. In January 2025, XTZ reached a maximum price of $1.49, but in February, it’s in the red zone, trading between $0.7414 and $0.7853.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,TRADING|XTZ|BUSINESS|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|FORKS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-28 01:30:55

Stripe bets big on stablecoins to transform payments This stance aligns with Stripe’s strategic moves, including its $1.1 billion acquisition of stablecoin startup Bridge in October. However, given that the company handles transactions equivalent to approximately 1% of global GDP, it’s worth exploring why co-founders Patrick and John Collison are betting on blockchain technology. According to their annual letter, the Collison brothers argued that stablecoins represent an “improvement” on the “basic usability of money,” much in the same way that banknotes were an advancement from coins and—perhaps more controversially among The Block readers—fiat currency was an upgrade from the gold standard. Stripe founders believe that stablecoins have four important properties relative to the status quo: They make money movement cheaper and faster, they are decentralized and open-access (and thus globally available from day one), and they are programmable. To be precise, fiat-pegged cryptocurrencies enhance traditional monetary functions and open new avenues for using money. “Improvements to the basic usability of money make economies more prosperous,” the Collison brothers write. Stripe’s stance on crypto has evolved over time. The company famously halted Bitcoin payments in 2018 after just a few years, citing blockchain limitations at the time. However, after a four-year hiatus, Stripe re-entered the crypto space by enabling payouts in USDC—a move that expanded two years later to allow customers to accept stablecoin payments on Solana, Ethereum, and Polygon. While the move may have been influenced by competitors like PayPal and Visa embracing crypto payments, the Collison brothers maintained that the industry’s maturation drove the decision—faster transaction speeds, lower costs, and stablecoins delivering “real utility.” The Stripe co-founders emphasized that years of research and careful systems engineering were required for decentralized technologies to become competitive with traditional financial infrastructure. According to their letter, the conditions for widespread stablecoin adoption have only recently come together. Stablecoins reshape the future of digital transactions The Collison brothers highlight that stablecoin transaction volumes more than doubled between Q4 2023 and Q4 2024, with over 40 million monthly active wallets now in use. They point out that stablecoins are increasingly used for real-world applications, including corporate treasury management, remittances, savings in countries with volatile currencies, and enabling payments in regions with low card penetration. Just as the Stripe co-founders credit much of the company’s success to their early investment in AI solutions, they believe that establishing a leadership position in stablecoin services could fuel Stripe’s next growth phase. While stablecoins are a win-win for Stripe and its client base, they also largely benefit the US government, as many stablecoin advocates have argued. Not only are nearly all stablecoins denominated in the U.S. dollar — strengthening the greenback’s economic hegemony — but issuers like Tether and Circle are among the largest buyers of U.S. government debt due to their need for low-risk treasury assets. As of the end of 2024, Tether has direct and indirect exposure to $113 billion in US government debt. According to Treasury Department data , if it were a nation-state, it would rank as the 19th-largest holder of U.S. Treasury bills. The Collison brothers believe that stablecoins, functioning as a more user-friendly and accessible version of eurodollars, have the potential to deliver similar benefits to a much wider range of participants. However, the subtitle of the stablecoin section in Stripe’s annual letter likened the asset class to “room-temperature semiconductors”—a groundbreaking innovation that, while theorized to be transformative, has yet to become a reality.

A dubious meeting app called ‘GrassCall’ was recently used to spread malware that drains the user’s crypto wallets. The fraud is allegedly carried out by a Russian hacker team known as “Crazy Evil.” This group of cybercriminals specializes in social engineering attacks that trick users into installing infected software on their Mac and Windows PCs. Crazy Evil commonly targets people in the crypto space, where they promote fake job opportunities and games via various social media websites. A cybersecurity company, Recorded Future , said that it has connected “over ten active scams on social media” to Crazy Evil. Hackers posted fake jobs for a sham company called ChainSeeker.io More recently, reports of another fake scam company surfaced. This time, the company was called ChainSeeker.io, according to an X user . According to the reports , threat actors created fake company profiles for ChainSeeker.io on LinkedIn, where they have been sending out premium job listings. Other popular job boards where the fake listing was spotted include CryptoJobList, and WellFound. Job listings by ChainSeeker (Source: choykwok on X) All those who applied for the jobs were contacted via email, which instructed them to contact the company’s marketing chief on Telegram. Scam emails sent out by ChainSeeker to all job applicants (Source: choykwok on X) The chief would then request the user download a video calling app named ‘GrassCall’ from a now-deleted website. Depending on the user’s browser, the website would offer them a Mac or Windows client. A screenshot of the since-flagged website of the malicious app (Source: BleepingComputer) After downloading the app, users are asked to enter a code shared by the CMO in the Telegram chat. The website then either provides a Mac “GrassCall_v.6.10.dmg” [VirusTotal] client or a Windows “GrassCall.exe” client [VirusTotal] client. Once the correct code is entered, both apps install an info stealer, like Rhadamanthys (on Windows), remote access trojans (RATs), or other malware. On Macs, the Atomic (AMOS) Stealer malware gets installed. Scammer providing GrassCall code to a potential victim (Source: choykwok on X) Once installed, the virus collects wallet addresses, authentication cookies, and passwords stored in the online browser and Apple Keychain. The stolen information gets uploaded to a server and gets posted on Telegram channels owned by the malicious actors. If a wallet is found, the hackers use a brute force method to crack the passwords and drain the user’s assets. From these assets, the hackers pay out the user who made the unsuspecting victim download the malicious app. According to publicly released payment information, Crazy Evil members apparently earn tens of thousands of dollars per victim. Crazy Evil’s Telegram channel showings its earnings per user (Source: G0njxa on X) Various users have recounted their experiences after applying to such scam job postings. Cristian Ghita, a LinkedIn user , posted on the platform, “It looked legit from almost all angles. Even the video-conferencing tool had an almost believable online presence.” The hackers have reportedly moved on to a social engineering new campaign Cybersecurity researcher, Gonjxa , has also identified dubious meeting apps called Gatherum, and VibeCall. Gatherum was used in previous campaign by a subgroup of Crazy Evil called “Kevland.” Interestingly, both apps’ branding is pretty much identical to GrassCall. Now, the scammers have moved on to their new campaign with VibeCall, which is currently being circulated among Web3 job seekers. In response to the attention this attack received online, Chain Seeker’s job postings have now reportedly been taken down by most of the job boards. Chainseeker.io website is now flagged in community databases LinkedIn search results do not return any job posts linked to Chainseeker.io anymore. At the same time, its website has been flagged in community databases for being suspicious. Furthermore, LinkedIn accounts of the company’s employees have all been deleted. Users who have already interacted with scammers or installed suspicious apps on their devices are advised to change their passwords and authentication tokens and move their crypto to fresh wallets as a precautionary measure. It is also recommended to turn on two-factor authentication via an authentication app on all websites that support this feature.

SHIB is currently trading near $0.0000143 and has recorded a modest price increase of over 0.50% in the past 24 hours. However, the meme coin has lost more than 22% of its value over the past 30 days. SHIB Price Action and Upcoming Level With this significant price drop, SHIB has recently retested a crucial support level at $0.000013, which has historically acted as a rebound zone. According to expert technical analysis, SHIB appears bearish and could decline by 20% in the coming days. This bearish outlook is driven by the prevailing negative market sentiment and the formation of a doji candle at the $0.000015 resistance level.

Why Investors Expect 6,000% Growth for MUTM",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/a-new-solana-at-just-0-015-why-investors-expect-6000-growth-for-mutm/,"The search for the next major crypto opportunity has led investors to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a decentralized lending protocol with strong fundamentals and real financial utility. While speculative assets rise and fall on hype, MUTM is positioning itself as a sustainable DeFi platform with an actual use case—allowing users to lend, borrow, and earn passive income. With its presale price at just $0.015, many investors see this as a chance to secure tokens at the lowest possible valuation before demand drives prices higher. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance offers a structured lending and borrowing model that is advantageous to both institutional and individual investors, in contrast to projects that just rely on speculation. Users can deposit their cryptocurrency assets into liquidity pools and get incentives depending on usage rates through peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending. However, by offering overcollateralized loans, borrowers can obtain money without having to liquidate their possessions. This process strengthens the token’s long-term worth by generating an ongoing demand cycle. Mutuum Finance also uses mtTokens, which are deposited assets that gradually earn income. When a user contributes Ethereum to the network, for instance, they earn mtETH, which automatically rises in value as interest accrues. This approach is a desirable substitute for conventional staking models since it provides a consistent flow of passive revenue. Presale Success and Price Growth Expectations The rapid momentum of Mutuum Finance’s presale is another strong indicator of investor confidence. In just a short time, over $1.5 million has been raised, with nearly 3,000 investors securing their stake in the project. With a launch price set at $0.06, early buyers are already positioned for a 400% gain before the token even hits exchanges. However, analysts predict that due to increasing adoption, utility-driven demand, and planned exchange listings, MUTM could see price levels exceeding $0.90 or higher, delivering the projected 6,000% growth over time. For instance, an investor would acquire 146,666 MUTM tokens if they invested $2,200 at a price of $0.015 per during the presale. Their investment would yield a 60x return, or $132,000, if the price hits $0.90. Given the strong fundamentals supporting this possibility, it’s simple to understand why early investors are rushing in. To support long-term value appreciation, Mutuum Finance implements a buy-and-distribute mechanism. A portion of platform revenue is used to buy back MUTM tokens, creating continuous buying pressure in the market. These tokens are then distributed to suppliers and liquidity providers, encouraging long-term holding while simultaneously reducing sell pressure. As more users engage with the platform, this system strengthens the token’s stability and overall growth potential. Another major catalyst for Mutuum Finance is its overcollateralized stablecoin, which will be introduced as part of the lending protocol. Mutuum’s stablecoin will be supported by on-chain collateral, guaranteeing security and transparency in contrast to centralized stablecoins that depend on currency reserves. In order to increase liquidity and preserve a solid peg to its value, borrowers will be able to mint the stablecoin against the assets they have deposited. Mutuum’s ecosystem is further improved by this innovation, which draws additional customers to its loan platform. Investors can win free MUTM tokens as part of a $100,000 promotion being held by Mutuum Finance. The goal of this campaign is to incentivize early backers and encourage more participation as the presale picks up steam. Complete information and eligibility requirements are accessible on the official website, where participants can enter by following easy instructions. With the presale gaining momentum and institutional interest growing, many believe that MUTM could be the next major player in DeFi lending. As it approaches launch, the time to enter at the lowest possible price is now, before it follows the trajectory of other successful DeFi projects and skyrockets in value.

Part of Metamask's revamped roadmap includes adding smart contract capabilities to its current wallet. At the moment, MetaMask is an Externally Owned Account (EOA), a type of wallet that is controlled by a public and a private key. One of the main downfalls with EOAs is that it is subject to human error, meaning if you forget your private key, you lose your crypto holdings in that account forever. The other type of wallet that exists on Ethereum are Contract Accounts (CAs), which are controlled by code and have recovery mechanisms in place and security checks for verifying transactions. In a blog post shared during ETHDenver, the largest North American Ethereum conference, the MetaMask team said “smart-contract-based accounts allow us to solve a number of problems: allowing new powerful uses of the assets you hold, while simultaneously improving security. When the user defines their terms from their own programmable account, we greatly expand how the user expresses their agency in ways that are enforced by their own code.” One of those new features aimed at making the user experience on MetaMask easier include ERC-5792, which builds on its current feature, smart transactions . Under ERC-5792, or known as batched transactions, users can combine certain steps when it comes to signing off transactions, like “approve + swap” in one click, meaning that they would save time and gas fees by batching those steps together. Dan Finlay, the co-founder of MetaMask, told CoinDesk that batching transactions “give us all the things you're going to ask for in order, we'll present them to the user in a nice, unified way. The user will pay for one gas fee for the series of events and then it'll just be one block for the whole series of operations.” MetaMask card The MetaMask team also shared that its MetaMask debit card will be available in select states in the U.S. starting mid-March. The card has been in production for a few months and was initially available just to users in the UK and EU. It connects to a user’s MetaMask wallet, letting them spend their crypto. “You can be earning staking rewards or yield on your favorite protocol with your favorite tokens and have those funds available to spend anywhere that Mastercard is accepted with just a tap,” the team wrote in a blogpost. More support As part of the theme of making the user-experience easier, the MetaMask team will be adding support for Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL) in its wallets, meaning users can hold their various crypto assets in one place. “So these are simultaneously delivering some of the most popular blockchains, but, but they're also ensuring that we have smoothed out every part of our interface that allows new blockchains to be added seamlessly,” Finlay said in the interview.

Bitcoin MVRV Z-Score Has Plunged Under Its 365-Day MA In a new post on X, CryptoQuant Head of Research Julio Moreno has talked about why Bitcoin may not have reached a bottom yet. “All valuation metrics are in correction territory,” notes the analyst. “It can take more time.” Related Reading: XRP Indicator Reliable Since 2022 Now Gives This Signal An indicator that Moreno has cited as an example of this trend is the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Z-Score. This metric basically tells us about how the market cap of the asset compares against its realized cap. The “realized cap” is an on-chain capitalization model that calculates the total value of the BTC supply by assuming that each token in circulation has its ‘true’ value equal to the spot price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain. In other words, the realized cap sums up the cost basis of the cryptocurrency’s supply. As such, the model can be interpreted as a measure of the total amount of capital the investors as a whole have put into BTC. Since the MVRV Z-Score compares the market cap, which represents the value the investors are holding right now, against this initial investment, it tells us about the profit-loss status of the cryptocurrency’s user base. The MVRV Z-Score is similar to the popular MVRV Ratio, but where it differs from the latter is that it also applies a standard deviation test to pull out the extremes from the data. Now, here is the chart shared by Moreno that shows the trend in the Bitcoin MVRV Z-Score, as well as its 365-day moving average (MA), over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin MVRV Z-Score has recently witnessed a sharp decline. The reason for this drawdown naturally lies in the crash that the asset’s price has just gone through, which has put many investors into a state of loss. Despite the plummet, though, the metric remains above the zero mark. Below this level, the overall market enters into a state of loss, so the boundary has historically proven to be an important one for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Bitcoin Mega Whales The Primary Sellers During Price Crash, Analytics Firm Reveals An important level that the metric has indeed lost, however, is the 365-day MA. As the analyst has highlighted in the chart, past breakdowns of the line have generally led to notable periods of struggle for the Bitcoin price. It only remains to be seen how long BTC would have to stay under the level this time around, before its price reaches a bottom. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $86,300, down more than 11% over the last seven days.

Web3Bay is transforming online shopping by removing intermediaries, creating a marketplace where transactions are directly between buyers and sellers, and maintaining complete autonomy. Unlike conventional platforms burdened with hefty fees and restrictive data policies, Web3Bay utilizes smart contracts for transactions that are secure and transparent. While Chainlink and Polkadot have made strides in data linkage and blockchain interoperability, Web3Bay captures attention by tackling the inefficiencies of e-commerce, delivering financial fairness and autonomy to its users. Web3Bay Pioneers Decentralized E-commerce with Blockchain! The migration from traditional to blockchain-enabled marketplaces is accelerating, with Web3Bay leading by eradicating intermediaries and empowering buyers and sellers with full transaction control. Web3Bay diverges from centralized services that set rigid rules and high fees, offering a decentralized choice where transactions are protected by smart contracts and ownership transparency is a given. The foundational principles of Web3—ownership, transparency, and decentralization—are reshaping online commerce. Web3Bay leverages blockchain to allow sellers to keep a larger share of profits while buyers enjoy transparent pricing free of undisclosed fees. Escrow-backed smart contracts also minimize fraud and disputes, fostering a marketplace where trust prevails over corporate governance. Investor trust in Web3Bay is on the rise, as evidenced by its presale collecting $1.5 million so far. Now in Stage 4, the 3BAY token is valued at $0.00456, with a total of over 375 million tokens already purchased. As users increasingly seek autonomy in their dealings, Web3Bay is recognized as a beacon for financial fairness and autonomy in online shopping. Chainlink’s Journey: From Inception to Today Launched in 2017, Chainlink (LINK) set out to connect smart contracts with real-world data via a decentralized Oracle network. It debuted during its ICO at a price of $0.11 and gathered $32 million. The technology has since facilitated secure access to external data for smart contracts, crucial for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. As of February 19, 2025, LINK is trading at $18.04, marking an increase of more than 16,000% from its ICO, with a circulating supply of about 517 million tokens and a market cap of $9.33 billion. Its significant role in DeFi, securing assets valued at over $75 billion across various platforms, contributes to this success. Polkadot’s Development and Current Market Performance Polkadot (DOT), which started in May 2020, seeks to improve blockchain interoperability with its innovative multi-chain structure.

40937161,https://coingape.com/?p=241500,1740708923,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,US SEC Confirms Meme Coins Are Not Securities but Warns of Fraud,https://coingape.com/us-sec-confirms-meme-coins-are-not-securities-but-warns-of-fraud/,"The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has clarified that meme coins do not fall under federal securities laws. The agency stated that these digital assets are more like collectibles and are not subject to the regulations that apply to traditional financial instruments. However, the SEC warned that fraudulent activities related to meme coins could still lead to enforcement actions by other federal or state authorities. US SEC States Meme Coins Are Not Securities In a statement released on February 27, the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance stated that meme coins do not qualify as securities under the Securities Act of 1933. “It is the Division’s view that transactions in the types of meme coins described in this statement do not involve the offer and sale of securities under the federal securities laws,” the statement read. The agency explained that meme coins do not provide any rights to future income, profits, or assets, which are key factors in determining whether an asset is a security. It also noted that meme coins do not generate yield and are primarily driven by market speculation and social trends. The agency clarified that since meme coins do not meet the definition of securities, their issuers and traders do not need to register transactions with the agency. The statement emphasized that meme coin buyers and holders are not protected by securities laws. SEC Warns of Fraud in the Meme Coin Market Despite the clarification that they are not securities, the SEC warned that fraudulent activities in this sector could still face legal consequences. The agency noted that while it does not regulate meme coins under securities laws, other federal or state agencies may take action against deceptive practices. Khurram Dara, a lawyer at Bain Capital Crypto, pointed out that misleading promotions, scams, and fraudulent schemes involving meme coins could still be prosecuted. The agency also stated that it would continue to monitor the crypto market for any potential violations of financial regulations. “The offer and sale of meme coins do not involve an investment in an enterprise nor is it undertaken with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others,” the statement added. House Democrats Bill to Restrict Politicians Before the SEC’s statement, House Democrats had announced plans to introduce the Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement (MEME) Act. The proposed bill seeks to prevent public officials, including presidents and their families, from launching or endorsing meme coins. California Representative Sam Liccardo, who is leading the bill, stated that the legislation aims to stop political figures from profiting off meme coins. The move comes after President Donald Trump launched a meme coin named “TRUMP” shortly before taking office. The TRUMP token saw rapid gains but later experienced a sharp decline, losing over 50% of its value in the past month. The market reaction led to concerns about political figures using meme coins for financial gain. Crypto Industry Reacts to SEC’s Clarification The statement has been welcomed by some members of the crypto industry who have long sought regulatory clarity. Ishmael Green, a crypto attorney at Diaz Reus law firm, said the decision could encourage more investment in the U.S. crypto market. “This will drive continued investment in the U.S. crypto space, as the vast majority of meme coins launched in the last 12 months with multibillion-dollar market caps have been released on Solana, an American blockchain,” Green stated. Major crypto exchanges, including Coinbase and Robinhood , saw a slight rise in their stock prices following the agency’s announcement. Market analysts believe that the clarification could allow exchanges to list more meme coins without the risk of regulatory enforcement.

The exchange has been rocked this month by sanctions from the regulatory Financial Intelligence Unit and news of a tax probe from the National Tax Service . Upbit Stock: Prices ‘Plummet’ The FIU punished Upbit’s operator Dunamu with a three-month restriction order on the activities of new users after ruling that the platform mishandled thousands of KYC verifications. A ‘bogus social security card’ allegedly accepted by Upbit as part of its KYC checks on new customers. (Source: KBS News/Screenshot) The same body also ordered the dismissal of the company’s compliance and reporting leads. It will follow up at a later date with fines. The tax body, meanwhile, thinks that customers may have used the exchange to evade taxes by using Upbit to send their funds to overseas platforms. The platform is also in the political spotlight, with many lawmakers criticizing Seoul for allowing Upbit to become a “monopoly,” with over 70% of the domestic crypto market share. Further issues continue to dog the exchange, with regulators suggesting the exchange has failed to follow crypto “market rules.” Per the South Korean media outlet Nogaek , Upbit now finds itself under “sudden all-out pressure from the regulatory authorities.” And this pressure, the media outlet wrote, has “put the brakes on its rapid growth.” Quoting data from South Korean unlisted stock price data providers, Dunama shares “have been falling for the past three months.” The Upbit customer service center in Seoul, South Korea. (Source: KBS News/Screenshot) 30% Drop The providers say that Upbit prices have tumbled from 217,000 won on December 17, 2024, to 153,000 won in late February, a fall of almost 30%. The media outlet added that the latest investigations will see Upbit’s “overseas remittance and transaction history” placed under scrutiny. Investigators also want to probe Upbit’s operations in Singapore, Thailand, and Indonesia via its Southeast Asia subsidiaries. The outlet suggested that if Upbit is found guilty of tax offenses, punishments “may go beyond simple fines” and instead result in “criminal cases.” However, the media outlet also said that some experts had opined that Upbit’s current “crisis” could transform into “an opportunity for another leap forward.” Market experts said that if Upbit could “overcome” the hurdles it now faces, it is likely to return to “a strong growth path” and a stock price “rebound.” They added that they expected the crypto market to experience a “long-term growth curve.” Like many major crypto exchanges, Upbit’s financial performance is closely linked to Bitcoin (BTC) prices. Trading volumes on the Upbit crypto exchange over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko) Corporate Investment Hope? During previous BTC bull markets, Upbit’s performance improved as traders became more active on its platform. High trading volumes result in more commission fee-derived revenue for Upbit and many of its main competitors. The South Korean crypto market will also receive further stimulus this year, as regulators finally allow corporations to buy BTC using their balance sheets .

You can take advantage of the situation and make money, whether the price is falling or increasing. You can test the AI robo advisor using its recently released beta platform. Even though RCO Finance is in the presale stage, it has shipped the beta platform for users to test and grow their portfolios. Over 10,000 users are already using the platform and providing feedback. The RCO Finance team has promised more features and upgrades in their upcoming alpha version.

The robo advisor evaluates the market’s volatility and adjusts their holdings in real-time. In addition, you can create your diverse portfolio by choosing assets from over 120,000 options.

As the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap struggles to maintain its footing, the Ethereum price has dropped sharply, triggering a wave of uncertainty among traders. With the Ethereum price teetering near the $2,400 mark and facing its worst February since 2018, a $100 million sell-off has further exacerbated the situation. This dramatic downturn has left traders searching for alternative investments, and one rising star in the crypto world, RCO Finance (RCOF) , is quickly capturing attention. Ethereum Price Crash: A High-Stakes Battle Between Bulls and Bears The recent Ethereum price crash has put the market on edge, with traders closely monitoring a potential short squeeze that could either fuel a rebound or deepen the decline. Currently trading at $2,479, Ethereum faces a massive liquidation risk, with over $2 billion in short positions set to be wiped out if ETH climbs to $3,000. This could trigger a short squeeze, forcing bearish traders to cover their positions and accelerating the Ethereum price recovery. However, uncertainty looms. A failure to reach the $3,000 threshold could prolong bearish sentiment, potentially driving ETH below $2,150. Compounding this pressure, an early Ethereum ICO whale has been offloading holdings, selling over $24.5 million worth of ETH in recent days. This large-scale profit-taking has spooked investors, raising concerns of further downward momentum. Ethereum now stands at a crucial juncture, with upcoming price movements likely determining whether it follows Bitcoin’s 2021 rally or continues its slump. RCO Finance (RCOF): The Rising DeFi Star Amid Ethereum’s Market Shake-Up As the Ethereum price grapples with a turbulent market, RCO Finance (RCOF) is rapidly gaining traction as the next big disruptor in decentralized finance. While Ethereum faces the risk of liquidation-driven volatility, RCO Finance draws investor attention with its cutting-edge AI-driven technology and innovative financial solutions. Unlike traditional altcoins focused on blockchain efficiency, RCO Finance integrates artificial intelligence to revolutionize portfolio management and asset diversification, setting a new standard in the DeFi sector. At the core of RCO Finance’s ecosystem is its AI Robo Advisor, an autonomous tool designed to navigate the complexities of the crypto market. This intelligent system continuously analyzes real-time market trends, historical data, and breaking financial news, ensuring investors maximize opportunities while minimizing risk. Unlike human traders prone to emotional decisions, the Robo Advisor operates 24/7, swiftly identifying high-potential assets, such as the recent surge in Vana (VANA) , which skyrocketed by 80% in just 24 hours. Moreover, it employs advanced hedging techniques to protect portfolios from sudden market downturns, leveraging insights from financial institutions and sources like Reuters to make data-driven recommendations. RCO Finance also redefines digital asset utility by enabling seamless investments in crypto and traditional financial markets. Users can diversify their holdings across stocks, bonds, and real estate without fiat conversions through its innovative framework. This breakthrough eliminates the usual barriers between blockchain-based and traditional finance, allowing investors to easily build multi-asset portfolios. Additionally, RCO Finance ensures full financial autonomy with low transaction fees and a completely KYC-free onboarding process, providing a seamless and private investment experience. Security remains a top priority, and SolidProof audits and verifies all smart contracts, offering users confidence in the platform’s reliability. Investor interest in RCO Finance is surging, particularly following the beta launch of its platform, which has already attracted over 10,000 active users. This growing adoption is fueled by the platform’s seamless automation, allowing even novice investors to execute complex trading strategies effortlessly. With the upcoming alpha launch, additional features, such as real-time portfolio monitoring and enhanced AI analytics, are set to further elevate RCO Finance’s appeal. RCO Finance (RCOF) Presale: A Prime Opportunity for Early Investors With Ethereum’s volatility prompting traders to seek alternative investment opportunities, RCO Finance is emerging as a high-potential asset. Currently in Presale Stage 5, RCOF tokens are available at $0.10, with the price set to increase to $0.13 in the next stage. Market analysts predict a listing price of $0.60, positioning early investors for potential 600% returns.

Beyond price appreciation, RCO Finance presents multiple avenues for wealth-building, including staking and yield farming, with APYs as high as 86%. Investors also gain exclusive benefits such as AI-powered trading analytics, fee discounts, priority customer support, and governance rights, allowing them to shape the platform’s future. As the Ethereum price fluctuations introduce uncertainty, RCO Finance is a promising alternative for traders seeking stability and exponential growth. With its AI-powered financial tools, multi-asset investment capabilities, and rapidly expanding community, RCO Finance is not just another altcoin; it is a transformative force in DeFi. Now is the time to seize this opportunity and become part of the next evolution in decentralized finance.

Internet Computer (ICP) works to replace traditional cloud systems with a decentralized network, while The Graph (GRT) simplifies data access through efficient blockchain indexing for decentralized apps. Yet, both face challenges related to market volatility and adoption hurdles. Web3Bay sets itself apart by blending AI smart contracts with blockchain technology, boosting e-commerce security, preventing fraud, and streamlining transactions. Using AI-powered contracts, Web3Bay connects blockchain capabilities with practical uses in online shopping. Web3Bay Uses AI to Secure and Personalize E-Commerce Web3Bay’s AI-driven smart contracts enhance security, tailor shopping experiences, and combat fraud in decentralized online markets. Common issues like fake products, chargeback scams, and slow dispute resolution are tackled by automating processes that keep transactions transparent and safe while offering personalized recommendations based on user activity. By analyzing transaction patterns, Web3Bay’s AI detects and blocks fraud attempts before they happen, protecting sellers and building buyer confidence. Escrow payments are automated using smart contracts that release funds only when terms are met, preventing false claims and disputes. Beyond safety, Web3Bay improves product discovery with AI that delivers personalized deals, unlike traditional platforms that use generic algorithms. This approach boosts user satisfaction while helping sellers increase their sales. With $1.5 million raised during its presale and over 380 million tokens sold in Stage 4 at $0.00456 per 3BAY, Web3Bay’s AI-driven model is set to reshape online shopping. Internet Computer (ICP): Decentralized Cloud and Network Growth Launched on May 10, 2021, by the DFINITY Foundation, Internet Computer (ICP) extends the Internet’s capabilities as a global computing platform. Unlike standard cloud services, it relies on independent data centers worldwide, allowing smart contracts to deliver interactive web content directly to users and removing the need for servers and centralized infrastructure. ICP has grown significantly, with the network processing over three billion blocks by March 2024, surpassing the block count of many other blockchains. This reflects its scalability and growing use in decentralized services. Financially, ICP has seen volatility. After launching at $461.65, its price as of February 19, 2025, stands at $6.88—a drop of about 98.5%. Despite this, ICP’s market capitalization remains strong at around $3.26 billion, showing that the platform continues to attract interest despite price swings. The Graph (GRT): Indexing Blockchain Data for Decentralized Apps Introduced in December 2020, The Graph (GRT) is an open-source protocol that indexes blockchain data, enabling developers to access and retrieve information from various networks. Using subgraphs—open APIs—it organizes and extracts data, supporting decentralized applications. The Graph’s query demand has grown substantially. In Q1 2024, the network processed over 1.6 billion queries, up 66% from the previous quarter. By Q2 2024, this number reached 2.9 billion queries—an 81.25% increase—highlighting its expanding role in the decentralized data ecosystem. From a financial standpoint, GRT has experienced price fluctuations. Initially priced at $0.03, it climbed to an all-time high of $2.84 before declining. As of February 19, 2025, GRT is valued at approximately $0.133935, reflecting a drop from its peak. Still, its market capitalization remains solid at about $1.22 billion, signaling ongoing confidence in its long-term potential. Final Remarks! Blockchain’s growth continues with projects like Internet Computer (ICP) and The Graph (GRT) transforming industries through decentralized computing and data indexing. ICP’s cloud alternatives and GRT’s data retrieval solutions help drive blockchain adoption, though scalability and market volatility remain challenges. Web3Bay stands out by applying blockchain to daily transactions with AI smart contracts that secure payments, prevent fraud, and personalize e-commerce. With a focus on practical benefits, Web3Bay bridges the gap between blockchain and everyday online shopping , signaling its role in driving mainstream blockchain adoption.

Dogecoin (DOGE) holders have gained substantially from November 2024 to January 2025, with the Dogecoin price rallying over 450% in this period.

Analysts suggest PropiChain can undergo a massive 35,000% rally after its listing and provide better returns than Dogecoin in the 2025 crypto bull run. Will Dogecoin Reverse Or Fall To Further Support? The Dogecoin price has performed underwhelmingly due to a decline in demand after its November rally. It has undergone a significant correction over the past few weeks after a rejection from the $0.42 resistance. Due to this rejection, Dogecoin plunged over 40% and consolidated at the $0.23 support for over two weeks. On Monday, DOGE witnessed massive selling pressure and dropped below this support level. In the last 24 hours, the daily trading volume has increased by 144%, and Dogecoin has declined 12.68%, currently trading at $0.2013. Due to the massive plunge, DOGE is now oversold with an RSI of 25.71. Dogecoin moved below its long-term 250-day SMA and is taking support at $0.196. If bulls enter and maintain the price above this support, it may reverse. PropiChain (PCHAIN): Invest In Tokenized Real Estate PropiChain is revolutionizing the real estate industry with its advanced RWA platform. It uses blockchain, AI, and the Metaverse to address the issues that have long plagued real estate investors, such as opaque pricing, high transaction costs, fraud risks, and lack of transparency. PropiChain uses tokens to represent small fractions of properties so users can trade real estate on the blockchain. This fractional ownership model enhances liquidity and diversification opportunities, giving users an advantage over conventional investors. The platform has also integrated advanced AI tools to simplify various investment processes. It has 24/7 active AI chatbots and virtual assistants that resolve users’ investment-related queries and provide assistance with complex paperwork and legal documents. The AI provides market insights by analyzing historical real estate sales data, such as future price fluctuations and demand changes. These insights help users develop data-driven investment strategies that can capture maximum returns. Users can also automate these strategies using AI by setting a condition like a specific valuation for a buy or sell order on a particular piece of real estate. The AI tracks the valuation and executes the order precisely to maximize potential returns. Furthermore, PropiChain users can use the Metaverse to get immersive 3D renderings for all listed real estate. Investors can thus take virtual tours of distant properties and assess their dream real estate to finalize investments from the comfort of their homes. Moreover, real estate owners can use the platform’s smart contracts to create lease agreements without manual paperwork or assistance from lawyers. The smart contracts automatically trigger the deal after the tenant transfers funds and both parties sign the document. Tenants can also automate their monthly rental payments using PropiChain’s smart contracts, and the landlord can set fixed penalties for late deposits. All the documents are stored on the blockchain, making the lease agreement publicly accessible and tamper-proof. PCHAIN: How The Emerging Crypto Can Outshine Dogecoin PCHAIN , the native token of the PropiChain ecosystem, is in the crypto presale phase. In stage two of the presale, it is available at an undervalued price of $0.011. The token’s value will soon surge to $0.023 when it reaches the third stage and to $0.032 after the presale. Thus, early investors who acquire the token before its next surge can turn $1,000 into over $2,000 by the next stage and over $2,900 by the end of the crypto presale. Moreover, crypto analysts suggest that PCHAIN’s practical use cases position it to undergo better growth than Dogecoin. They have predicted a massive 35,000% surge by the end of 2025, providing a $351,000 return on a $1,000 investment to early participants. Conclusion Due to disheartening performance, many Dogecoin holders are moving funds to the PropiChain token presale to make steady returns. Analysts also prefer PropiChain, as it has shown better returns in the past few weeks and has the potential for explosive growth after its launch. Regarding user safety, the leading blockchain security firm, BlockAudit , conducted rigorous security testing of the PropiChain platform, inspecting core infrastructure, smart contracts, security measures, and regulatory compliance. The final audit report highlights zero security vulnerabilities, reliable infrastructure, and complete compliance with regulations, guaranteeing PropiChain’s integrity and the security of the user’s funds. Furthermore, PCHAIN has been listed on CoinMarketCap . The listing has provided a broad audience for the project, significantly boosting its crypto presale performance. Token holders can expect quicker returns as the project reaches further milestones and presale gains more momentum. Analysts suggest PCHAIN can provide tremendous returns and outperform the Dogecoin price in the next bull cycle, forecasting a massive 35,000% rally this year. Thus, early presale participants can turn $1,000 in PCHAIN at this stage into $351,000 by the end of the year.

OpenAI just dropped a bombshell in the AI world with its latest model, GPT-4.5, codenamed ‘Orion.’ This isn’t just another incremental update; it’s a leap in AI persuasion , showcasing an uncanny ability to influence even other AI models. Imagine an AI that’s not just intelligent, but also remarkably convincing – that’s GPT-4.5. Let’s dive into why this news is sending ripples across the tech and crypto communities. Why is GPT-4.5’s Persuasion Prowess a Game Changer? OpenAI’s recent white paper reveals fascinating insights into GPT-4.5 ‘s capabilities, particularly in ‘persuasion.’ But what does this mean in practical terms? Essentially, OpenAI rigorously tested how well GPT-4.5 could influence beliefs and actions using model-generated content. The results are eye-opening, especially for those watching the intersection of AI and digital economies. One standout benchmark involved GPT-4.5 attempting to persuade another AI model , GPT-4o, to ‘donate’ virtual money. The outcome? GPT-4.5 outperformed all other OpenAI models, including those specifically designed for reasoning. It even surpassed the o3-mini model by a significant 10 percentage points in deceiving GPT-4o into revealing a secret codeword. This isn’t just about clever algorithms; it’s about a new level of sophistication in AI interaction. Here’s a breakdown of GPT-4.5’s performance in OpenAI’s persuasion benchmarks: Benchmark GPT-4.5 Performance Key Observation Virtual Money Donation Superior to all other OpenAI models GPT-4.5 employed a ‘modest request’ strategy, asking for smaller amounts to increase success rate. Codeword Deception 10 percentage points better than o3-mini Demonstrates enhanced ability to manipulate and extract information from other AI models. This data, straight from OpenAI’s evaluations, underscores a critical point: AI models are evolving beyond mere data processing; they’re learning the art of influence. While the amounts ‘donated’ were virtual, the implications for real-world applications, especially in areas like decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and smart contracts, are substantial. Navigating the Ethical Tightrope: AI Safety and Persuasion The rise of highly persuasive AI models like GPT-4.5 isn’t without its concerns, particularly around AI safety .

The company has stated that GPT-4.5, despite its persuasive abilities, doesn’t yet cross their internal ‘high-risk’ threshold for this benchmark. However, they’ve also committed to rigorous safety interventions before releasing any model that does reach that level. This is a crucial stance, considering the growing anxieties around AI-driven deepfakes and social engineering attacks. The ability of an AI to convincingly persuade could be a double-edged sword. While it opens doors for innovative applications, it also raises questions about misuse. OpenAI’s proactive approach to AI safety , including revising methods to assess real-world persuasion risks, is a welcome step in responsible AI development. What Does This Mean for the Future of AI and Crypto? For the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, GPT-4.5’s persuasion capabilities could unlock exciting new possibilities: Enhanced Smart Contracts: Imagine smart contracts that can dynamically adapt and negotiate terms based on persuasive AI agents. DAOs with Nuance: DAOs could become more sophisticated in decision-making, leveraging AI for nuanced negotiations and consensus-building. Advanced Trading Bots: AI-powered trading bots could evolve to not just analyze data, but also persuasively interact with market participants (other AI agents or even human traders in a controlled context – ethically of course!). However, it’s vital to approach these advancements with caution. As AI persuasion becomes more refined, the need for robust ethical frameworks and regulatory discussions in the crypto and AI sectors becomes paramount. We need to ensure that this powerful technology is used responsibly and for the benefit of the ecosystem.

OpenAI, the powerhouse behind ChatGPT, has just dropped a bombshell: they’re facing a critical GPU shortage . CEO Sam Altman himself confirmed that the rollout of their highly anticipated GPT-4.5 model is being throttled because, quite simply, they’ve run out of GPUs. For crypto enthusiasts and tech followers who understand the value of computational power, this news is a stark reminder of the infrastructure challenges underpinning the AI revolution. OpenAI Confirms GPU Shortage Hindering GPT-4.5 Launch In a candid post on X, Altman stated the obvious – OpenAI’s rapid growth and the sheer scale of GPT-4.5 have led to an unprecedented demand for Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). These powerful processors are the lifeblood of modern AI, enabling the complex computations needed to run large language models. According to Altman, GPT-4.5, described as “giant” and “expensive,” needs “tens of thousands” more GPUs before it can be widely accessible to ChatGPT users. This GPU shortage isn’t just a minor inconvenience; it’s a significant bottleneck impacting the accessibility of cutting-edge AI. GPT-4.5: First Access for ChatGPT Pro, Then Plus – But When for Everyone Else? The rollout plan is now staggered. ChatGPT Pro subscribers will get first dibs on GPT-4.5 starting this Thursday, followed by ChatGPT Plus customers next week. This phased approach highlights the severity of the GPU shortage . It’s not just about delaying features; it’s about managing limited resources to ensure some level of access while they scramble to acquire more processing power. For users eager to experience the latest AI advancements, this wait might feel like an eternity in the fast-paced tech world. Unhinged Pricing: The Staggering Cost of GPT-4.5 Beyond the GPU shortage , another aspect of GPT-4.5 is raising eyebrows – its pricing. Prepare for sticker shock: OpenAI is charging a whopping $75 per million tokens (roughly 750,000 words) fed into the model and $150 per million tokens generated by it. Let’s break down this AI model pricing : Input Cost: $75 per million tokens Output Cost: $150 per million tokens Comparison to GPT-4o: 30x the input cost and 15x the output cost This pricing structure is significantly higher than OpenAI’s current workhorse model, GPT-4o. The 30x increase in input cost and 15x increase in output cost compared to GPT-4o is, as some users online have described, “unhinged.” This pricing model suggests GPT-4.5 is not just an incremental upgrade; it’s a fundamentally more resource-intensive and premium offering. The tweet from Casper Hansen perfectly captures the sentiment: “GPT 4.5 pricing is unhinged. If this doesn’t have enormous models smell, I will be disappointed.” Addressing the Root Cause: OpenAI’s Plan to Tackle GPU Dependency Altman acknowledged that these GPU shortages are not ideal. “We’ve been growing a lot and are out of GPUs,” he admitted. He also mentioned plans to add “tens of thousands of GPUs next week” to expand access to the Plus tier. However, he emphasized the difficulty in predicting and perfectly managing growth surges that lead to these shortages. This isn’t a new problem for OpenAI. Altman has previously stated that limited computing capacity is a recurring obstacle in their product development pipeline. To combat this long-term, OpenAI is taking a multi-pronged approach to lessen their reliance on external GPU suppliers and secure their computing future. Their strategy includes: Developing Proprietary AI Chips: Moving towards in-house chip design to optimize performance and potentially reduce costs and dependency on market fluctuations. This AI chip development is a significant undertaking, but could provide a competitive edge and greater control over their infrastructure. Building Massive Datacenters: Investing in extensive datacenter infrastructure to house and operate the massive computational resources needed for their AI models. This is a capital-intensive but necessary step to support the growing demand for AI. What Does This Mean for the Future of AI and Crypto? The OpenAI GPU shortage is more than just a temporary setback; it’s a symptom of the intense computational demands of advanced AI and the limitations of current infrastructure. For the cryptocurrency world, which is increasingly intertwined with AI through applications like algorithmic trading, blockchain analytics, and decentralized AI platforms, this news is highly relevant. Here’s why this GPU crunch matters to the crypto and broader tech space: AI Development Bottleneck: GPU scarcity can slow down the pace of AI innovation across industries. If even giants like OpenAI are struggling, smaller startups and research labs could face even greater hurdles. Increased Costs: High demand for GPUs can drive up prices, making AI development more expensive. This could impact the accessibility and affordability of AI-powered tools and services.

Crypto markets are known for their volatility, and just when you thought you’d seen it all, another twist emerges. Recent analysis from CryptoQuant analyst tugbachain suggests we might be witnessing a crucial turning point for Bitcoin. Let’s dive into the details and understand what this could mean for your crypto portfolio. Is Bitcoin Oversold? Decoding the NVT Golden Cross Signal According to a recent report by CryptoQuant analyst tugbachain, the NVT Golden Cross indicator has flashed a significant signal. This indicator, which is closely watched by market experts, has plunged below -2.4. Why is this important? This level typically indicates that Bitcoin has entered an oversold territory. But what exactly does “oversold” mean in the context of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets? Oversold Explained: When an asset is oversold, it suggests that the price has fallen too quickly and too far, often driven by excessive selling pressure. This situation is often considered unsustainable in the long run. The NVT Golden Cross Indicator: The NVT (Network Value to Transactions) Golden Cross is a momentum indicator that compares the network value of Bitcoin to the daily transaction volume on the blockchain. A low NVT Golden Cross can suggest undervaluation or oversold conditions. Below -2.4 Threshold: Historically, when the NVT Golden Cross dips below -2.4, it has often preceded periods of price stabilization or even upward price correction for Bitcoin. In simpler terms, the NVT Golden Cross indicator is suggesting that the recent Bitcoin price drop might be an overreaction, and the market could be poised for a reversal. Potential Bitcoin Rebound: What Could Trigger the Turnaround? While the Bitcoin oversold signal is promising, it’s crucial to understand that it’s not a guarantee of an immediate price surge. However, it does increase the probability of a Bitcoin rebound . So, what factors could contribute to a potential upward movement? Market Sentiment Shift: Oversold conditions can sometimes lead to a shift in market sentiment. Traders and investors might start to view Bitcoin as undervalued, leading to renewed buying interest. Technical Correction: After a sharp decline, markets often experience a technical correction. This is a natural price recovery as the market adjusts from the excessive selling pressure. Whale Activity: Large Bitcoin holders, often referred to as “whales,” might see oversold conditions as an opportune moment to accumulate more Bitcoin, further driving up demand and potentially triggering a rebound. Positive News Catalysts: Unexpected positive news, such as favorable regulatory developments or increased institutional adoption, could act as a catalyst to propel Bitcoin out of the oversold zone. It’s important to remember that the crypto market is influenced by a multitude of factors, and predicting the exact timing and magnitude of a rebound is challenging. However, the oversold signal combined with these potential catalysts does paint a cautiously optimistic picture. Analyzing Bitcoin Price Analysis: Key Resistance Levels to Watch If a Bitcoin rebound does materialize, where could the price potentially go? The CryptoQuant analyst points to a significant resistance level: the 111-day moving average (DMA), currently around $96,895. Let’s break down why this level is important in Bitcoin price analysis : Technical Indicator Description Significance 111-day Moving Average (DMA) The average closing price of Bitcoin over the past 111 days. Moving averages are used to smooth out price fluctuations and identify trends. The 111-DMA can act as a dynamic resistance level. Resistance Level A price level where selling pressure is expected to outweigh buying pressure, potentially halting or reversing an upward price movement. If Bitcoin rebounds, the 111-DMA at $96,895 could present a significant hurdle. Breaking above this level would signal further bullish momentum. Traders and investors should closely monitor Bitcoin’s price action around this $96,895 level if a rebound begins. A successful break above this resistance could open the door for further gains, while failure to overcome it might indicate continued consolidation or even another price correction.

Watch for Confirmation: Don’t rely solely on one indicator. Look for confirmation of a rebound through other technical indicators, price action, and market sentiment shifts. The current market situation presents both risks and opportunities. By staying informed, understanding the signals like the NVT Golden Cross, and managing your risk, you can navigate this potentially pivotal moment in the Bitcoin market. Conclusion: Is the Bitcoin Bottom In? A Cautious Optimism The analysis from CryptoQuant analyst tugbachain, highlighting the Bitcoin oversold signal based on the NVT Golden Cross, offers a glimmer of hope for those watching the recent price declines. While it’s not a guarantee of an immediate price surge, it does suggest that a Bitcoin rebound is increasingly probable. The 111-DMA at $96,895 stands as a key resistance level to watch if the rebound materializes, and Bitcoin price analysis suggests this level will be crucial. By understanding these signals and remaining vigilant, you can position yourself to potentially capitalize on the next phase of Bitcoin’s market cycle.

The usually smooth waters of testnet deployments have just encountered a significant ripple. Ethereum core developer Tim Beiko has sounded the alarm on X, announcing an urgent situation with the Pectra upgrade on the Holesky testnet. What started as a routine activation on Monday has quickly turned into a race against time to stabilize the network. Let’s dive into what’s happening and what it means for you, especially if you’re a validator on Holesky or Sepolia. What’s the Buzz About the Ethereum Pectra Upgrade and Holesky Testnet? For those unfamiliar, the Ethereum Pectra upgrade is the next major step in Ethereum’s ongoing evolution. Think of it as the latest software update for the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. These upgrades are crucial for enhancing Ethereum’s capabilities, improving performance, and paving the way for future innovations. Before these upgrades hit the main Ethereum network, they are rigorously tested on testnets like Holesky. Holesky testnet , launched as a successor to Goerli, is designed to simulate the Ethereum mainnet environment, allowing developers to test new features and upgrades in a live setting without risking real funds. It’s a critical sandbox for ensuring the robustness and stability of Ethereum’s future developments. Think of it as a dress rehearsal before the main show. The Chain Split Bug: A Speed Bump in the Pectra Upgrade Journey The current hiccup involves a “chain-splitting EL bug” that emerged immediately after the Pectra upgrade activated on Holesky this Monday. In simple terms, a chain split means the blockchain is no longer in agreement about its history. Imagine two groups of people reading different versions of the same book – that’s essentially what a chain split is in the blockchain world. This disagreement can lead to network instability and unpredictable behavior, which is the last thing you want on a testnet designed for stability testing! Why is a chain split bug a problem? Network Instability: A chain split disrupts the smooth operation of the testnet, making it unreliable for developers to test their applications. Data Inconsistency: Different parts of the network might have different views of the blockchain’s state, leading to confusion and errors. Hindered Testing: The primary purpose of Holesky, to test upgrades, is compromised if the testnet itself is unstable. This isn’t necessarily a doomsday scenario, but it’s definitely a red flag that requires immediate attention from the Ethereum core developers. It highlights the inherent complexities in upgrading a decentralized network and the importance of thorough testing. Urgent Call to Action: Holesky Validators Must Update Now! Tim Beiko’s announcement wasn’t just an FYI; it was an urgent call to action, particularly for validators on the Holesky testnet. Validators are the backbone of any proof-of-stake blockchain like Ethereum. They are responsible for verifying transactions and maintaining the network’s integrity. If validators don’t act quickly, the consequences could be significant. The Key Action: Node Update The fix for this chain split bug comes in the form of a software update for Ethereum Execution Layer (EL) clients. Validators are being instructed to update their nodes – the software they run to participate in the Ethereum network – to the latest version that incorporates the fix. This update is crucial to bring the network back into consensus and resolve the chain split. Why is this update so critical? Because failure to update nodes by a specific deadline leads to a rather unpleasant outcome: a mass slashing event. Mass Slashing Event: The Clock is Ticking! Now, let’s talk about the elephant in the room – the dreaded “mass slashing event.” Slashing is a mechanism in proof-of-stake systems designed to penalize validators for misbehavior or, in this case, for running outdated software that contributes to network instability. In essence, validators who don’t update their nodes in time will face a penalty, losing a portion of their staked ETH. The Deadline: February 28th, 15:00 UTC Mark your calendars and set your alarms, Holesky validators! The deadline for updating nodes is February 28th at 15:00 UTC. This isn’t just a suggestion; it’s a hard deadline. Validators who haven’t updated by this time risk being slashed. The urgency is palpable, and the Ethereum development community is working hard to ensure everyone is aware and takes the necessary steps. What does mass slashing mean? Financial Penalty: Validators who are slashed will lose a portion of their staked ETH. The exact amount can vary, but it’s a significant financial disincentive. Reputational Damage: Being slashed can also damage a validator’s reputation within the Ethereum community. Network Health: While slashing is a necessary mechanism, a mass slashing event, even on a testnet, can disrupt network operations and validator participation temporarily. Sepolia Users: Are You Affected Too? The announcement also mentions that some Sepolia users are required to upgrade. Sepolia is another important Ethereum testnet, often used for testing smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). While the primary focus of the urgent update is on Holesky due to the Pectra upgrade activation, it seems the underlying bug might have implications for Sepolia as well, at least for certain users. Who on Sepolia needs to upgrade? The specifics for Sepolia users are less detailed in the initial announcement, but the mention suggests that if you are running a node on Sepolia, especially if you are involved in testing related to recent Ethereum updates or using specific client software, it’s prudent to check for updates and follow any instructions from client developers or the Ethereum Foundation. It’s always better to be safe than sorry, especially when dealing with network-level issues. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community This situation, while concerning, provides valuable insights for the broader cryptocurrency community: Importance of Testnets: This incident underscores the critical role of testnets like Holesky and Sepolia in the development process. They are designed to catch bugs and issues before they impact the mainnet, saving potentially millions (or billions) of dollars and preventing major disruptions. Agility and Responsiveness: The Ethereum core developers’ rapid response and communication highlight the agility of the Ethereum development community. Identifying the bug, developing a fix, and communicating it to validators within a short timeframe demonstrates a robust and responsive system. Validator Responsibility: This event emphasizes the responsibility that comes with being a validator in a proof-of-stake network. Validators are not passive participants; they play an active role in maintaining network health and must be vigilant in applying updates and following protocol guidelines. Transparency and Communication: Tim Beiko’s public announcement on X is a testament to the transparency within the Ethereum ecosystem. Open communication about issues, even critical ones, builds trust and allows the community to respond effectively. Navigating the Ethereum Pectra Upgrade Bug: A Summary The Ethereum Pectra upgrade on the Holesky testnet has hit a snag with a chain-splitting EL bug. This requires immediate action from Holesky validators to update their nodes before the February 28th deadline to avoid a mass slashing event. Some Sepolia users might also need to update. While this is a setback, it’s also a testament to the rigorous testing and proactive nature of Ethereum’s development process. Testnets are doing their job by catching these issues before they reach the mainnet, and the community is mobilizing to address the situation swiftly. This episode serves as a powerful reminder of the complexities of blockchain technology and the constant vigilance required to maintain and upgrade these intricate systems. Stay tuned for further updates as the Ethereum developers work to resolve this issue and get the Pectra upgrade back on track for a smooth and successful deployment.

40939371,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=135164,1740712793,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Triumph for Coinbase: SEC Lawsuit Dismissed with Prejudice – A Relief for Crypto?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/coinbase-sec-lawsuit-dismissed/,"In a surprising turn of events that sent ripples of excitement through the crypto community, leading cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have officially put an end to their legal battle. According to a recent announcement from Tree News on X, the lawsuit between Coinbase and the SEC has been dismissed “with prejudice.” But what does this mean for Coinbase, the broader crypto landscape, and what led to this unexpected resolution? Let’s dive into the details of this landmark lawsuit dismissal and explore its potential implications. What Does ‘Dismissed with Prejudice’ Mean for the Coinbase Lawsuit? For those unfamiliar with legal jargon, “dismissed with prejudice” is a significant term. It essentially means that the case is permanently closed and cannot be refiled in the same court. This is a crucial victory for Coinbase as it signals a definitive end to this particular legal challenge from the SEC. Unlike a dismissal “without prejudice,” which leaves the door open for the case to be brought again, this dismissal provides Coinbase with a sense of closure and legal certainty regarding this specific matter. Let’s break down why this is such a big deal: Finality: The most important aspect is the finality. Coinbase doesn’t have to worry about the SEC resurrecting this exact lawsuit in the future. This removes a significant cloud of uncertainty that has been hanging over the exchange. Positive Signal: A dismissal with prejudice can be interpreted as an acknowledgment, at least in this instance, that the SEC’s case might not have been as strong as initially perceived. It’s not an admission of wrongdoing by the SEC, but it certainly suggests a strategic retreat in this particular legal arena. Resource Relief: Legal battles are expensive and time-consuming. Dismissing the Coinbase lawsuit frees up Coinbase’s resources, both financial and personnel, allowing them to focus on growth, innovation, and navigating the evolving regulatory landscape more proactively. This dismissal comes as a welcome relief for Coinbase and its supporters, who have been closely watching the developments of this legal tussle. Understanding the Context: The SEC’s Crypto Regulation Stance To fully appreciate the significance of this SEC lawsuit dismissal, it’s important to understand the broader context of the SEC’s approach to crypto regulation . The SEC has been increasingly assertive in its oversight of the cryptocurrency industry, often taking an enforcement-first approach. They have argued that many cryptocurrencies and crypto-related services fall under their jurisdiction as securities, requiring them to comply with securities laws. Coinbase, as one of the largest and most prominent cryptocurrency exchanges globally, has often found itself in the crosshairs of regulatory scrutiny. The specifics of the dismissed lawsuit, while not detailed in the initial announcement, likely revolved around the SEC’s interpretation of Coinbase’s operations and whether certain aspects of their services constituted securities offerings or violations of securities laws. Here’s a simplified look at the SEC’s general concerns regarding crypto: SEC Concern Why it Matters Unregistered Securities The SEC believes many tokens are securities and must be registered, protecting investors through disclosure and oversight. Investor Protection Ensuring fair markets and preventing fraud and manipulation in the crypto space is a key SEC priority. Market Integrity Maintaining orderly and efficient markets, which the SEC believes is compromised by unregulated crypto activities. Coinbase has consistently maintained that it operates within the bounds of the law and has advocated for clearer regulatory guidelines for the crypto industry. This Coinbase SEC situation highlights the ongoing tension between innovation in the crypto space and the traditional regulatory frameworks. Benefits and Broader Implications of the Lawsuit Dismissal The dismissal of the Coinbase SEC lawsuit isn’t just a win for Coinbase; it has broader implications for the entire cryptocurrency industry. Let’s explore some of the key benefits and potential ripple effects: Boost to Coinbase’s Stock and Reputation: The news of the dismissal is likely to be viewed positively by investors, potentially boosting Coinbase’s stock price and strengthening its reputation as a resilient and legally sound platform. Positive Sentiment for Crypto Market: This development could inject positive sentiment into the broader crypto market. It may be interpreted as a sign that regulatory pressures might be easing, or at least that legal battles against major crypto players are not always straightforward for regulators. Potential for Constructive Dialogue: Perhaps this dismissal could pave the way for a more constructive dialogue between the SEC and the crypto industry. Instead of solely relying on enforcement actions, there might be a greater incentive for both sides to engage in developing clearer and more practical regulatory frameworks. Encouragement for Innovation: Reduced legal uncertainty can encourage further innovation and investment in the crypto space. Businesses might feel more confident in developing new products and services knowing that the immediate threat of this particular type of legal action has subsided. However, it’s crucial to remain grounded and realistic. While this lawsuit dismissal is undoubtedly positive news, it doesn’t signify the end of regulatory scrutiny for Coinbase or the crypto industry as a whole. Challenges Ahead and the Future of Crypto Regulation Despite this victory, Coinbase and the crypto industry still face significant regulatory challenges. The SEC and other regulatory bodies globally are continuing to grapple with how to effectively oversee this rapidly evolving sector. Here are some ongoing challenges and considerations: Ongoing Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for crypto remains fragmented and often unclear. Different jurisdictions have varying approaches, and even within the U.S., there’s still a lack of comprehensive and consistent regulations. Potential for Future SEC Actions: While this specific lawsuit is dismissed, it doesn’t preclude the SEC from initiating other investigations or enforcement actions against Coinbase or other crypto companies in the future, potentially on different grounds. Need for Clearer Regulatory Frameworks: The crypto industry continues to advocate for clearer and more tailored regulatory frameworks that recognize the unique characteristics of blockchain technology and digital assets, rather than simply applying existing securities laws in a blanket manner. Global Regulatory Coordination: Given the global nature of cryptocurrencies, international regulatory coordination is essential to prevent regulatory arbitrage and ensure consistent standards across different countries. Coinbase and other industry leaders will need to continue engaging with regulators, advocating for sensible rules, and demonstrating their commitment to compliance and investor protection. The dismissal of this lawsuit is a battle won, but the broader regulatory war is far from over. Actionable Insights: What Can We Learn From This? This lawsuit dismissal provides several valuable insights for both crypto enthusiasts and those in the traditional financial world: Legal Battles are Not Always Decisive: Regulatory agencies don’t always win legal challenges. This case demonstrates that even powerful regulators like the SEC can face setbacks in court. Advocacy and Engagement Matter: Coinbase’s proactive engagement with regulators and its willingness to defend its position in court likely played a role in this outcome. The crypto industry needs to continue advocating for its interests and engaging in constructive dialogue with policymakers. Regulatory Clarity is Crucial: The ongoing regulatory uncertainty highlights the urgent need for clearer and more tailored rules for the crypto industry. This benefits both businesses and consumers by providing a more predictable and stable environment. Resilience of the Crypto Industry: Despite facing numerous regulatory hurdles and legal challenges, the crypto industry continues to demonstrate resilience and innovation. This dismissal can be seen as another example of its ability to navigate complex and often hostile regulatory environments. Conclusion: A Moment of Relief, But the Journey Continues The dismissal of the lawsuit between Coinbase and the SEC with prejudice marks a significant and undoubtedly positive development for Coinbase and the cryptocurrency industry. It’s a moment of relief, offering a respite from legal uncertainty and potentially paving the way for a more constructive regulatory dialogue. However, it’s crucial to remember that this is just one step in a long and evolving journey. The regulatory landscape for crypto remains complex and dynamic, and ongoing engagement, advocacy, and collaboration will be essential to ensure the responsible and sustainable growth of this transformative technology. This victory should be seen as an encouragement to continue building, innovating, and working towards a future where crypto can thrive within a clear and supportive regulatory framework.

40939791,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=135169,1740713342,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary Crypto Partnership: Aleo Foundation Joins Forces with Google Cloud for Zero-Knowledge Innovation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/aleo-foundation-google-cloud-partnership/,"Exciting news ripples through the crypto sphere! Aleo Foundation, the driving force behind the innovative layer-1 blockchain leveraging zero-knowledge proof technology, has just announced a groundbreaking strategic partnership with tech giant Google Cloud. This collaboration is poised to inject fresh momentum into the world of blockchain analytics and developer accessibility. Let’s dive into what this powerful alliance means for the future of blockchain and, more specifically, the Aleo ecosystem. Why is this Strategic Partnership a Game Changer? In a nutshell, this strategic partnership is a significant leap forward for both Aleo and the wider blockchain community. Google Cloud, a titan in cloud computing, will officially step in as a blockchain validator for the Aleo network. But the collaboration extends far beyond validation. Google Cloud plans to deeply integrate with and analyze Aleo’s blockchain data using its sophisticated BigQuery platform. What does this mean in practical terms? Enhanced Network Security and Reliability: Google Cloud’s participation as a validator strengthens Aleo’s network by adding a robust and reputable entity to the consensus mechanism. Unlocking Real-Time Blockchain Data Analysis: The integration with Google Cloud BigQuery is the real headline here.

In a technical analysis shared on X, Rose Premium Signals (@VipRoseTr) highlights a potentially bullish setup for Dogecoin (DOGE), fueled by a classic “Cup & Handle” pattern. Dogecoin Cup And Handle Could Emerge According to the chart, the DOGE price could face a last leg down before it will find its low near the $0.16896 support zone. This level marks the base of a possible Cup & Handle pattern—a formation characterized by a rounded “cup” followed by a smaller consolidation or “handle.” Technically, the cup phase reflects the market’s effort to find a bottom, while the handle phase often takes shape as a brief pullback or sideways movement before a potential breakout. The pivotal zone for DOGE’s next move appears to be near $0.29124. If price rallies above this threshold, it would likely confirm the Cup & Handle formation and could trigger a robust upward swing. The chart suggests that traders may interpret a decisive daily or weekly close above $0.29124 as a confirmation signal, potentially ushering in bullish momentum. Related Reading: Long-Term Dogecoin Holders Are In “Denial” – On-Chain Metrics Expose Weakness “DOGE is showing strong bullish potential as it approaches a key reversal zone. Price has reached the $0.16896 support, aligning with a potential Cup & Handle formation. A breakout above $0.29124 could confirm a rally toward new highs,” Rose Premium Signals writes via X. In terms of upside objectives, Rose Premium Signals indicates that DOGE could climb toward the $0.50 – $0.60 range if the Cup & Handle pattern plays out as anticipated. This target corresponds to historical zones of increased trading activity and psychological levels that often capture traders’ attention. The analysis further notes potential for further upside, hinting that Dogecoin’s trajectory may extend beyond $0.60 should positive sentiment intensify. “Long-term target sits near $0.50 – $0.60, with potential for further upside. If momentum continues, Dogecoin could reclaim its meme coin throne and push toward higher levels,” the analysts say. Related Reading: If Dogecoin Falls Below This Level, A Freefall To $0.06 Is Possible: Analyst This commentary underscores DOGE’s capacity to reclaim its status among top meme coins. While the recent memecoin mania has flooded the market with thousands of smaller tokens, diverting attention from the original memecoin, Dogecoin, the landscape may be shifting. Following the burst of the memecoin bubble— which peaked with TRUMP, MELANIA, and LIBRA— focus could soon return to DOGE as traders seek more established assets in the space. From a technical perspective, a decisive breakout with sustained momentum could reignite both retail and institutional interest, propelling DOGE toward higher resistance levels and confirming the potential Cup & Handle pattern.

The cryptocurrency hit a high of $2.97 during a massive rally, despite the broader market downturn that saw Bitcoin dip below $85k. As Pi Coin recovers from an initial sell-off, predictions and targets are flying high, with some speculating that the price could hit $3 or even $4 in the future. What’s Driving Pi’s Price? Despite recent losses, analysts and investors are eyeing potential events that could push the price of Pi Coin higher in the near future. Analyst Kim Wong took to social media and revealed details, listing key events that could lead to Pi’s price surge: Major Exchange Listings: A Pi Coin listing on major exchanges could be right around the corner. If confirmed, it may trigger a big price increase. Past exchange listings, like OKX’s listing, have seen Pi jump by over 36% in just an hour. “If a major exchange greenlight listing, history suggests a 50-100% price pop isn’t out of the question,” he wrote. Increasing Popularity: As Pi Coin gains more attention, new supporters and investors may flock to the Pi Network, boosting demand for Pi Coin. Partnerships with Merchants and Payment Platforms: If major online shopping companies and merchants announce partnerships with Pi Network, it could provide further legitimacy and value to Pi Coin, making it more attractive to buyers. Expansion of the Pi Ecosystem: More decentralized applications (Dapps) in Pi’s ecosystem could increase its utility and spark investor interest. Influential Endorsements: Endorsements from well-known crypto media outlets and experts could significantly increase Pi’s visibility and attract more investors.

Helium & Arweave Investors Are Reacting Fast,https://thecoinrise.com/2025s-biggest-presale-boom-web3bay-secures-1-55m-in-weeks-helium-arweave-investors-are-reacting-fast/,"Blockchain technology is changing industries like wireless connectivity, data storage, and online shopping. Helium introduced a decentralized wireless network where users earn HNT for IoT coverage, while Arweave enables permanent blockchain data storage. As more blockchain services gain attention, Web3Bay is emerging as a key player in decentralized e-commerce. With $1.55 million raised during its presale and over 375 million tokens sold, Web3Bay is attracting widespread interest. Compared to Helium and Arweave, which focus on specific needs, Web3Bay’s platform aims to compete with giants like Amazon and eBay by offering lower fees and more user control. Why Crypto Analysts Show Confidence in Web3Bay’s Growth Potential Web3Bay’s presale has gained traction, raising $1.55 million as popular crypto figures on Twitter and YouTube highlight its potential. With over 375 million tokens sold, the project has drawn the attention of early adopters who see its promise in reshaping online retail. Currently, in Stage 4, the 3BAY token is priced at $0.00456 before the next price increase. Influencer marketing has significantly contributed to boosting Web3Bay’s visibility and traction. Prominent crypto analysts and traders have been pivotal in promoting its decentralized marketplace as an effective alternative to traditional platforms like Amazon and eBay, which are known for their high fees and centralized control. Moreover, reviews on YouTube and active discussions on Twitter have spurred organic engagement, enhancing investor confidence in the project’s innovative vision. Social proof is significantly driving Web3Bay’s expansion. Crypto influencers engaging with the presale and sharing their positive experiences have captured the attention of retail investors. Additionally, endorsements from well-known figures could increase its reach beyond crypto circles. Together, these factors, along with growing demand, position Web3Bay as a blockchain commerce platform with strong community support. Helium: The Crypto-Powered Decentralized Wireless Network Helium was founded in 2013 by Amir Haleem, Shawn Fanning, and Sean Carey, aiming to create a decentralized wireless network. In 2019, it launched Helium Hotspots, allowing users to earn HNT for providing IoT coverage. By 2021, the network had expanded to over 500,000 hotspots in 169 countries. In April 2023, Helium moved to the Solana blockchain to improve efficiency. This transition helped launch Helium Mobile in December 2023, a decentralized mobile network now generating about 90% of the project’s revenue. Despite market ups and downs, Helium remains active in Web3. As of February 2025, HNT trades at $3.46, reflecting steady usage and adoption. Its decentralized model continues to attract individuals and businesses seeking wireless infrastructure outside traditional systems. Arweave: Enabling Permanent Blockchain Storage Arweave began in June 2018, offering permanent data storage on the blockchain. In 2019, it raised $5 million from backers like Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures. Its growth accelerated in 2021 as demand for permanent storage increased with the rise of NFTs. By early 2025, daily data uploads averaged more than 400 GB. Despite price fluctuations, Arweave remains a leading choice for long-term blockchain storage. For example, the AR token rose above $40 in August 2024 before stabilizing at $9.05 in February 2025. Arweave’s lasting value lies in its low-cost, permanent storage for digital assets like archives, NFTs, and decentralized social media. As adoption grows, it continues to serve as a core storage layer for Web3 applications that need data preservation. To Sum Up! Blockchain platforms are reshaping traditional industries, providing decentralized alternatives to centralized services. Helium offers a wireless network powered by user participation, while Arweave ensures permanent data storage. Both address specific needs within blockchain technology. However, Web3Bay takes a broader approach, aiming to disrupt e-commerce with lower fees and greater control for users. With $1.55 million raised in presale and growing recognition across crypto communities, Web3Bay stands out as a platform with the potential to challenge leading online marketplaces.

The exchange, once a dominant player in the crypto derivatives market, has enlisted Broadhaven Capital Partners, an investment banking firm, to facilitate a sale, according to a CoinDesk report . The development comes as BitMEX grapples with legal troubles, including a hefty $100 million fine over anti-money laundering violations. Broadhaven Capital Partners specializes in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) advisory and has worked with several financial institutions in securing strategic deals. The search for a buyer underscores the competitive landscape of the crypto derivatives market, where leading platforms are looking to consolidate their positions. BitMEX, founded in 2014, was once a pioneer in Bitcoin futures trading, but it has faced growing competition from rivals like Deribit, Binance, and Bybit. BitMEX’s reported sale efforts come amid a wave of mergers and acquisitions in the crypto industry. Notably, Deribit, the world’s leading Bitcoin and Ethereum options exchange, has been at the center of a bidding war between Coinbase and Kraken as both firms seek to expand their derivatives offerings. Meanwhile, FalconX, a prime brokerage firm, recently acquired Arbelos Markets , a trading firm specializing in crypto derivatives. The deal is part of FalconX’s expansion strategy to strengthen its presence in the derivatives sector, an area of growing interest for institutional investors. BitMEX’s attempt to find a buyer comes just over a month after a US court ordered the exchange to pay a $100 million fine for violating anti-money laundering laws. This follows a 2022 guilty plea from BitMEX and its co-founders, who had already paid $110 million in penalties. The legal troubles stem from a 2020 indictment that led to Arthur Hayes stepping down as CEO. The US Department of Justice had accused BitMEX’s leadership —including co-founders Ben Delo and Samuel Reed—of failing to implement proper compliance measures, allowing illicit transactions to flow through the exchange. As BitMEX explores a sale, the outcome could reshape the competitive landscape of the crypto derivatives industry. Whether a major player acquires the platform or it struggles to find a buyer remains to be seen. With regulatory scrutiny tightening, the fate of BitMEX will likely influence how other crypto exchanges navigate compliance and M&A strategies moving forward.

The price is now consolidating losses and remains at risk of more losses. XRP price started a fresh decline below the $2.250 level. The price is now trading below $2.220 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.20 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might continue to move down unless there is a close above the $2.30 resistance zone. XRP Price Dips Further XRP price failed to continue higher above the $2.350 resistance zone and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . There was a move below the $2.25 and $2.20 support levels. The price even dipped below the $2.120 support to enter a bearish zone. A low was formed at $2.0220 and the price is now struggling to stay above $2.0. The price is showing many bearish signs below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.363 swing high to the $2.022 low. The price is now trading below $2.10 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.120 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.20 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.363 swing high to the $2.022 low. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.20 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The next resistance is $2.30. A clear move above the $2.30 resistance might send the price toward the $2.350 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.420 resistance or even $2.450 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.50. More Losses? If XRP fails to clear the $2.20 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.020 level. The next major support is near the $2.00 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.00 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $1.9650 support. The next major support sits near the $1.880 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level.

The legal dispute, which began in December 2020, revolves around the SEC’s claim that Ripple sold XRP as an unregistered security. With growing regulatory scrutiny and political pressure, the crypto community is watching closely for any signs of resolution in the XRP lawsuit. Will the SEC Dismiss XRP Lawsuit After Closed-Door Meeting? The SEC’s Sunshine Act meeting focused on enforcement actions, administrative proceedings, and litigation settlements. While the agenda remains confidential, speculation is growing that the Ripple case was a topic of discussion. Recent decisions by the SEC to drop investigations into major crypto firms, including Coinbase and Uniswap, have fueled hopes that the XRP lawsuit may be nearing its conclusion. Legal experts have mixed opinions on the SEC’s next move . Former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel downplayed the speculation, stating, “There’s no more reason to think Ripple is on the agenda than at the last 200 meetings.” However, pro-XRP attorney Bill Morgan remains confident in Ripple’s position, pointing out that the SEC’s legal argument has weakened after Judge Analisa Torres ruled in 2023 that XRP itself is not a security. Cynthia Lummis Stance on SEC Dropping Lawsuits Against Major Firms U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis, a vocal advocate for cryptocurrency regulations, recently highlighted the need for legal clarity on digital assets. She stated, “Most digital assets are not legally securities under the Howey Test. The United States is behind other countries in creating laws for digital assets.” Responding to Lummis’ statement, Bill Morgan referenced the Ripple case and Judge Torres’ ruling. He wrote on X, “So you agree Judge Torres was correct in finding XRP itself is not a security in SEC v Ripple.” This exchange highlights the growing recognition among lawmakers and legal experts that the SEC’s classification of XRP may not hold up under legal scrutiny. Moreover, the SEC has recently withdrawn several high-profile lawsuits, signaling a possible shift in its enforcement strategy. The agency voluntarily dismissed its case against Coinbase Global Inc and Consensys reached an agreement to dismiss the securities enforcement case related to MetaMask. Concurrently, the agency has also dropped cases against Uniswap, Gemini, OpenSea, Robinhood Crypto, and Binance’s case being paused for 60 days. Potential Impact on XRP Price The XRP lawsuit has had a strong effect on Ripple’s market standing. On February 28, XRP declined by 7.59%, following broader market trends with Bitcoin price falling below the $80k support. However, analysts believe that if the US SEC drops its appeal, XRP price could experience a major rally to $320 . Historical price trends show that legal victories for Ripple have led to significant gains. When Judge Torres ruled in Ripple’s favor in July 2023, XRP surged by over 70%. A full dismissal of the XRP lawsuit could push the token toward its previous all-time high of $3.55. Market analysts are also discussing the potential approval of an XRP spot ETF, which could attract institutional investment especially with the agency acknowledging some XRP ETF’s last week. If the Ripple case is resolved, XRP may gain further regulatory clarity, making it more appealing to large financial firms. While speculation around the SEC meeting continues, no official decision has been announced regarding the XRP lawsuit. The next key deadline is April 16, 2025, when Ripple must submit its reply brief related to the SEC’s appeal. If the SEC decides to withdraw its appeal before then, the case could effectively be resolved.

Nevertheless, the coin’s dominance managed to stay up by 0.07%, signaling altcoins continue to face more pressure. ETH Price Slips Below $2,200 ETH price tanked over 7% in the past 24 hours, closing in at $2,152. The coin hit an intraday bottom and peak of $2,128.18 and $2,378.09, respectively. Ethereum recorded liquidations worth $166.28 million in the past 24 hours, rationalizing the slumping action. XRP Price Nears $2 Mark XRP price traded at $2.02 at the time of reporting, crashing 8% intraday. Ripple’s native coin hit a low and high of $2.02 and $2.25 over the past day.

The attack, which occurred on February 21, saw hackers infiltrate one of Bybit’s cold wallets and steal over 41,000 ETH. This breach added to a growing list of high-profile cryptocurrency heists orchestrated by North Korean hacking entities. US Authorities Sound Alarm on North Korea’s Crypto Heists In a joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) issued by the FBI, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the US Treasury Department, authorities warned about the increasing cyber risks posed by North Korea-backed advanced persistent threat (APT) groups. The Lazarus Group, also known by aliases such as APT38, BlueNoroff, and Stardust Chollima, has been conducting cyber theft operations since at least 2020. The entity has been known for systematically targeting cryptocurrency exchanges, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, play-to-earn gaming platforms, as well as venture capital firms investing in digital assets. The advisory outlined the group’s tactics, which include social engineering, spearphishing campaigns, and the deployment of trojanized cryptocurrency applications to infiltrate networks and exfiltrate funds. According to US authorities, North Korean hackers use sophisticated malware strains, including the notorious AppleJeus malware, to compromise cryptocurrency platforms. These cyber actors frequently exploit vulnerabilities in financial technology firms and blockchain infrastructure to launder stolen digital assets, ultimately funneling funds back to the North Korean regime. “TraderTraitor” The Bybit hack follows a familiar pattern, with attackers using deceptive recruitment tactics to lure employees into downloading compromised trading applications, referred to as “TraderTraitor.” These applications are designed with cross-platform JavaScript and Node.js to make them appear legitimate but contain hidden malware that allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to private keys and initiate fraudulent blockchain transactions. With North Korea’s cyber theft operations continuing to escalate, the US government has reiterated its commitment to combating illicit activities in the cryptocurrency sector. The FBI urges cryptocurrency firms to strengthen cybersecurity measures, monitor for indicators of compromise (IOCs), and implement robust security protocols to mitigate risks associated with North Korean-backed cyber threats.

While skeptics have long criticized cryptocurrency’s lack of intrinsic value, RWA platforms fundamentally reshape this narrative by bringing tangible assets – from real estate to equities – onto the blockchain. Four key players exemplify the sector’s maturation and growing institutional adoption. Their success underscores a crucial reality – RWA operates as a complex two-sided marketplace, requiring both willing asset owners and sophisticated investors. As Wall Street takes interest, a new batch of regulations that nurture the burgeoning sector is crucial for long-term growth. Pendle Pendle offers perhaps the most innovative approach to yield-bearing assets. Unlike traditional products where ownership and yield are inseparable, Pendle’s model allows separate trading of PT (principal tokens) and YT (yield tokens). This flexibility has driven their total value locked to $5.9 billion, five times larger than that of their nearest competitor. Their fixed yields for popular products reach as high as 14.7% for USDe, attracting investors seeking stable returns in volatile markets. Ethena Ethena’s trajectory demonstrates the critical role of venture capital in shaping the RWA landscape. Following a $14 million Series A round that attracted investments from Franklin Templeton and Fidelity, they’ve secured strategic partnerships with World Liberty Financial and Deribit. Their synthetic dollar, sUSDe, offering a six percent APY, represents a new generation of yield-bearing assets designed for institutional adoption. Ondo Ondo Finance exemplifies the sector’s push toward mainstream integration. Through partnerships with BlackRock and Morgan Stanley, they’ve launched tokenized versions of blue-chip stocks and ETFs, including Coca-Cola (onKO) and SPDR Gold Shares (onGLD). Their recent announcement of Ondo Chain – purpose-built for institutional-grade RWAs – signals growing confidence in the sector’s future. What makes these developments particularly significant is their timing. As retail investors grow increasingly sophisticated and demand more stable investment vehicles, RWA platforms offer a compelling solution. When the average US home price stands at $356,585, fractional ownership through tokenization democratizes access to previously exclusive asset classes. The regulatory environment appears increasingly supportive – particularly in the US – where stablecoin legislation is gaining momentum. This could provide a substantial boost to yield-bearing assets like Ondo’s USDY, currently unavailable to US investors. Wall Street’s latest (and biggest?) bet The RWA transformation extends beyond traditional finance – innovative projects are exploring tokenization of everything from aviation financing to electric motorcycle fleets, demonstrating the versatility of RWA platforms. However, challenges remain. The sector must navigate complex regulatory requirements, ensure robust security measures and build sufficient liquidity across various asset classes. Success requires substantial capital – evidenced by the aggressive fundraising among leading platforms – to secure regulatory approvals and build institutional-grade infrastructure. Even with these challenges, traditional financial institutions are taking notice. The involvement of firms like BlackRock, Morgan Stanley and Fidelity isn’t merely symbolic – i t represents a fundamental shift in how Wall Street views digital assets. These partnerships provide crucial infrastructure and credibility, helping bridge the gap between traditional and DeFi (decentralized finance). Yet the trajectory is clear. RWA tokenization represents more than just another blockchain use case – it’s a fundamental reimagining of how we interact with traditional assets. By breaking down barriers to investment and creating more efficient markets, these platforms are driving what may be the most profound cultural and economic impact within the crypto space. As we move through 2025, the question isn’t whether RWA will transform finance, but rather which platforms will emerge as the dominant players in this new paradigm. For investors and institutions alike, understanding this evolution isn’t just advantageous – it’s essential. The next phase of growth will likely come from increased institutional adoption, regulatory clarity and innovative applications that push the boundaries of what can be tokenized.

According to the FBI, the Bybit hack, known as “TraderTraitor,” is part of a wider series of cyberattacks attributed to North Korean state-sponsored hackers. Meanwhile, forensic investigations by Sygnia Labs and Verichain confirmed that Bybit’s security infrastructure remained intact despite the breach. A detailed post-mortem of the hack revealed that the vulnerability was linked to a Safe Wallet developer machine that had been compromised. The attackers exploited this machine to insert malicious JavaScript code into the Gnosis Safe UI, specifically targeting Bybit’s cold wallet. Safe has affirmed that its smart contracts are safe, but the incident shows that hackers are increasingly focusing on infrastructure providers rather than exchanges themselves. Bybit has launched a website to track the laundering of its stolen funds and is offering a bounty to exchanges that assist in recovering the assets.

While some analysts hope for a price reversal to the upside, others predict a further crash to $70,000, eradicating almost all gains achieved after the US election rally. Popular crypto analyst and Co-founder of BitMEX Arthur Hayes has shared a bearish prediction for the Bitcoin price. Hayes projects a further breakdown in Bitcoin’s value, suggesting an imminent drop between $70,000 and $75,000. Bitcoin Price Crash To $70,000 A Possibility The crypto founder shared a 2-hour Bitcoin price chart from BitMEX, explaining how the pioneer cryptocurrency could experience this decline and citing macroeconomic factors tied to United States (US) President Donald Trump as a trigger for this price drawdown. Related Reading: End Of The Road For Bitcoin? Analyst Reveals When Price Will Crash To $50,000 Hayes suggests that the market is entering a cooling phase, characterized by a potential retracement to pre-election liquidity levels. A cooling phase is a period during which the price of a cryptocurrency declines and consolidates as the market attempts to stabilize. It typically comes after a cryptocurrency experiences an explosive price increase. Looking at his price chart, the BitMEX Co-founder pinpointed a demand zone around the blue-shaded area between $76,000 and $65,000. This price range serves as a critical support area, where traders expect significant buying interest, enough to prevent further price declines. Hayes believes that the Bitcoin price’s possible decline to $70,000 hinges on Trump’s budget and debt ceiling decision. He suggests that if Trump fails to pass a budget that increases spending and raises the debt ceiling, then further market capitulation could occur. This means that the market may undergo a rapid sell-off by a large number of investors, triggering a panic that could lead to further declines in the Bitcoin price. Additionally, if Trump’s influence over the Republican Party weakens, Hayes indicates that market uncertainty could grow, potentially triggering a continuation of the current Bitcoin downturn. Moreover, a debt ceiling reduction could negatively impact the market’s liquidation and fuel more price fluctuations. Overall, Haye’s bearish outlook for Bitcoin is tied to Trump’s fiscal influence. The BitMEX Co-founder suggests that, for now, the market can only “chill out, retrace, and wait.” BTC’s 3-Day Decline Marks Highest Since FTX Crash According to MetaEra, the recent 3-day decline in the Bitcoin price is the highest crash seen since the FTX fiasco in 2022. In the first three days of this week, Bitcoin recorded a 12.6% drop in value, pushing it down to its current price of $86,227. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Prediction: Analyst Charts Roadmap To $117,000, What You Should Know MetaEra revealed that the widespread market sell-off could be attributed to the negative sentiment and disappointment over President Trump’s lack of swift action regarding his promises to the crypto community. Prior to his election, Trump indicated a strong interest in creating a national Bitcoin Reserve and tightening fiat liquidity conditions. With no mention of plans concerning these crucial initiatives, uncertainty looms, leading to a weakened market sentiment.

But that’s not all. The SEC has now dropped its case against Consensys, the company behind the popular MetaMask wallet. This is a big win for Ethereum and the crypto community. Joseph Lubin, the founder of Consensys, celebrated the news, saying it was a victory for blockchain developers who deserve a fair chance to grow without unnecessary legal challenges. He also pointed out that this lawsuit played a part in getting the SEC to drop its investigation into Ethereum itself. “Every legal and policy win might be hard fought, but each is an important step along the path to a better financial system and a better internet. We appreciate the SEC’s new leadership and the pro-innovation, pro-investor path they are taking. We will remain deeply engaged with public and private policymakers going forward,” he wrote. These legal victories are part of a bigger trend where some regulators, like Hester Peirce, are working to clear out cases that don’t involve fraud, making room for crypto projects to thrive. While these wins are big, there are still ongoing cases, such as those with Kraken and Ripple. Many hope these cases will also be paused or dropped, much like what happened with others. I'm pleased to announce that Consensys and the SEC have agreed in principle that the securities enforcement case concerning MetaMask should be dismissed. Subject to the approval of the Commission, the SEC will file a stipulation with the court that effectively closes the case.… — Joseph Lubin (@ethereumJoseph) February 27, 2025 Lubin concluded, “Now we can get 100% back to building. 2025 is going to be the best year yet for Ethereum and Consensys. The paradigm shift to a much more decentralized world is accelerating.” The dropping of these cases is seen as very positive for the market. Institutional investors, who were hesitant to dive into crypto due to legal concerns, are now more likely to jump in.

The downturn comes amid heightened global trade war concerns fueled by Donald Trump’s new tariffs on the EU, Canada, and Mexico, leading to widespread investor panic. With over $700 million worth of liquidations in the past 24 hours and a 4% decline in total market capitalization to $2.7 trillion, traders remain on edge about the next move. Bitcoin price drops as market volatility surges Bitcoin’s price fell by more than 5% in the last 24 hours, reaching a low of $79,523 before stabilizing at $80,430, according to CoinMarketCap data . The decline resulted in $365.91 million in BTC liquidations, signaling heightened sell-offs. However, Bitcoin’s market dominance increased by 0.07%, suggesting altcoins bore the brunt of the selling pressure. Ethereum witnessed a sharp 7% drop, sinking to $2,132 with an intraday low of $2,128.18. The second-largest cryptocurrency faced $166.28 million in liquidations as traders reacted to broader market trends. Source: CoinMarketCap Altcoins face heavy sell-offs XRP plunged 7% to $2.04, with liquidations totaling $17.94 million. Solana (SOL) dropped 8%, trading at $128.42. Despite the sell-off, market expert Raoul Pal remains optimistic, citing oversold conditions. Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) plummeted 8% despite whale accumulation and increased SHIB burn rates. Pepe Coin (PEPE) and TRUMP Coin saw the biggest losses, declining 12%-16%. Top gainers and losers in today’s crypto market While most cryptos bled, a few tokens managed to stay in the green: Top Gainers: Berachain (BERA): +4% ($7.71) Litecoin (LTC): +2% ($124.81) UNUS SED LEO (LEO): +1% ($9.20) Top Losers: Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL): -12% ($1.01) Raydium (RAY): -12% ($2.13) Meanwhile, the Asian stock markets tumbled on Friday after US President Donald Trump confirmed tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China, rattling investor sentiment. Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped 0.9%, while the Topix fell 0.68% in early trading. South Korea’s Kospi tumbled 1.54%, with the Kosdaq down 1.69%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index lost 1.14%, while Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 slipped 0.86%. China’s CSI 300 remained largely flat as investors assessed the potential impact of additional US trade measures. This renewed trade uncertainty weighed heavily on US markets, with all three major indexes closing lower. The S&P 500 fell 1.59% to 5,861.57, extending its weekly losses. The Nasdaq Composite tumbled 2.78% to 18,544.42, dragged down by an 8.5% drop in Nvidia, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 193.62 points (0.45%) to close at 43,239.50. The crypto market continues to grapple with macroeconomic pressures and liquidity challenges, leading to heightened uncertainty. With Bitcoin and Ethereum at critical support levels, traders remain cautious, awaiting further market signals.

Adding to the momentum, ETH transaction fees have dropped to just $0.40 – the lowest since July 2020. This reduction in costs could provide the push needed for ETH to break past the $3,000 mark and beyond. Meanwhile, Bitcoin could also get a potential boost with the emergence of PlutoChain ($PLUTO). This project introduces smart contracts to Bitcoin, paving the way for deeper DeFi integration and expanding its real-world use cases beyond the current transactional one. Let’s check out the details. Ethereum’s Transaction Fees Drop to Multi-Year Lows – Is a Major Rally on the Horizon? Ethereum has once again made the news as its transaction fees have crashed to a stunning $0.40, a multi-year low last seen in 2020. This sharp drop, with the 7-day average tumbling 70% to $0.77 earlier this week, has slashed costs from January’s highs, sparking a wave of bullish excitement. ETH sits at $2,819, and with fees this cheap, analysts predict a price explosion as adoption soars. Ethereum 7-day chart, Source: CoinMarketCap Resistance at $2,800 and $2,925 is in sight, and the daily chart’s bullish triangle could catapult ETH past these if volume, now at $16 billion daily, roars back to January’s $25 billion peak. The RSI, hovering at 32-35, is primed for a bullish flip from oversold territory. The fee drop, tied to upgrades like Dencun, is a game-changer – lower costs mean more users, dApps, and DeFi action, historically a rocket for ETH’s price (think 2020-2021’s surge). All of this has led analysts to believe that a surge is ahead. Coin Signals points out that all of these events will lead to a price surge between $3,600-$5,800 while Dohimai sees a 20-22% increase by the end of March. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) Could Draw Whale Interest With its Innovative Layer-2 Blockchain For Bitcoin – Greatly Improves Speed, Scalability and Expansion PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could get whale attention with its clever take on a hybrid Layer-2 blockchain built to improve Bitcoin’s network. It keeps the security we all trust and increases the speed instead. Test runs show it can tackle over 43,200 transactions a day, pushing scalability to new heights. For Bitcoin, this means stepping beyond its “digital gold” role into something you’d actually use daily. Developers find a lot to like here. PlutoChain introduces smart contracts into Bitcoin’s toolkit, letting them craft decentralized apps with ease. It’s got Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility too, so they can port their Ethereum projects over to Bitcoin without any problems. Users have quick, low-cost transactions and DeFi features like lending or staking, all wrapped in Bitcoin’s sturdy framework. Bitcoin’s DeFi presence remains negligible compared to Ethereum’s $64 billion in Total Value Locked or Solana’s high-throughput network. PlutoChain could position Bitcoin to compete more effectively by combining its unmatched security with DeFi capabilities. While it’s not poised to overtake Ethereum or Solana outright, it strengthens Bitcoin’s presence in that sector. PlutoChain has undergone rigorous audits by reputable firms including SolidProof, QuillAudits, and Assure DeFi, ensuring its smart contracts and infrastructure meet high standards. Additionally, its decentralized governance model empowers community members to vote on protocol decisions – creating transparency and involvement. PlutoChain aims to enhance Bitcoin with speed, scalability, and expanded functionality, offering developers a robust platform and users practical advantages. As a Layer-2 solution, it could elevate Bitcoin’s potential in DeFi and beyond, making it a project worth watching. Conclusion Ethereum’s sharp drop in transaction fees to $0.40 could be the catalyst for its next major rally, with analysts predicting a surge past $3,000 and potentially up to $5,800. Lower fees historically drive adoption, fueling DeFi activity and network usage. At the same time, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could expand Bitcoin’s overall utility in areas such as DeFi and more by adding smart contracts support to its secure network. Audited and community-led, this project might bring a steady, intriguing upgrade to Bitcoin’s underdeveloped network. ——- Disclaimer: It’s important to note that participating in presales carries risks, including market volatility and potential project delays.

The past 24 hours tell a different story, with only 21,956,446 SHIB burnt, marking a 27.19% decline compared to the previous day. Despite this supply reduction, SHIB’s price remains under pressure, dropping 7.03% in the past 24 hours to trade at $0.00001341. The meme coin’s market cap has also taken a hit, falling 7.02% to $7.85 billion. With selling pressure mounting, investors are watching closely to see if the recent burn activity can counteract the prevailing bearish sentiment.

SHIB chart by TradingView SHIB faces strong resistance SHIB continues to face resistance at $0.000015, a level that has consistently prevented upward momentum. The latest price action suggests that traders remain cautious, with the token’s 24-hour decline of 7.03% reinforcing concerns about further downside movement. At the same time, SHIB’s total supply remains high at 589.25 trillion tokens, meaning burn events alone may not be enough to trigger significant price appreciation in the short term. On-chain data from Coinglass shows that SHIB futures open interest (OI) has dropped significantly, suggesting that traders are cutting exposure amid heightened volatility. Source: Coinglass With major liquidation areas identified at $0.00001413 on the lower end and $0.000015 on the upper side, market sentiment remains a key factor in determining SHIB’s next move. Source: Coinglass If the price continues to slide and reaches $0.00001413, nearly $350,000 worth of long positions could be liquidated. Conversely, a breakout to $0.000015 could see approximately $750,000 in short positions wiped out. The overall decline in trading volumes further signals a lack of strong buying interest at current levels. Can burn strategy support SHIB? While SHIB’s weekly burn rate has increased, the decline in daily burns raises questions about whether supply reductions alone can support a price rebound. The token’s value has now fallen over 7% in just 24 hours and more than 22% in the past month, showing that broader market trends continue to weigh on its performance. Historically, SHIB has relied on strong community engagement and speculative interest to fuel rallies. The latest pullback suggests that investor enthusiasm is fading, with reduced futures open interest indicating a cautious approach from traders. Without a major catalyst, SHIB may continue to struggle against key resistance levels. If market sentiment does not improve, SHIB could retest its support level at $0.000013, potentially leading to further losses. Meanwhile, traders will be monitoring whether burn activity can regain momentum, as a slowdown in token removals may further limit the chances of a sustained price recovery. The upcoming weeks will be critical in determining whether SHIB can regain traction or if the bearish trend will deepen further.

How Low Will BTC Price Go?,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-bitcoin-is-dropping-how-low-btc-price-will-drop/,"The post Why is Bitcoin Dropping? How Low Will BTC Price Go? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bloodshed in the crypto market doesn’t seem to be stopping as nearly $700 billion has been wiped out. In the past eight days, Bitcoin has fallen from $99,000 to $79,000, losing all the gains it made from the hype around President Trump’s pro-crypto policies. But what is causing this sudden drop, and how low can Bitcoin go? Bitcoin Hits a Four-Month Low Bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency, has fallen more than 5% in the last 24 hours, hitting a four-month low of $79,263 . One major reason for this drop is growing fear in the market due to President Trump’s tariff threats, which have created uncertainty in the economy. At the same time, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index has fallen to 21, its lowest level in nearly three years. This shows that many investors are scared and unsure about the market. Short-Term Holders Lose Over $2 Billion Many of the recent Bitcoin losses come from short-term holders (STHs) who have sold their Bitcoin in panic. In the last three days alone, these holders have lost $2.16 billion . Investors who bought Bitcoin in the last week lost $927 million. Those who bought in the last month lost $678 million. Holders who had Bitcoin for one to twelve months lost $257 million. Even those who bought in the last 24 hours lost $322 million. This shows that many new investors are losing confidence and rushing to sell. Meme Coins Under Regulatory Pressure The U.S. SEC recently said that meme coins are not securities. While this sounds like good news, it made the situation worse. Many meme coins rely on hype and social trends, and with Bitcoin dropping, meme coins have also crashed, adding more panic to the market. Disappointment with Trump’s Crypto Promises Bitcoin’s decline is also linked to disappointment with President Trump’s crypto plans. Many investors expected strong pro-crypto policies, but things are moving slower than expected. This has led to selling pressure on cryptocurrencies that gained from Trump’s support. Altcoins Also Suffer Heavy Losses Bitcoin’s drop has affected the whole market. Other major cryptocurrencies have also fallen. Ethereum (ETH) is down 7.5%, XRP has dropped 8.2%, and Solana (SOL) has fallen 9%. This shows that investors are losing trust in the crypto market. How Low Can Bitcoin Go? Bitcoin’s price drop has made traders worried. Some believe Bitcoin needs to fill a gap near $80,000 before recovering. Meanwhile, Crypto analyst AlphaBTC thinks that if Bitcoin fills this gap, it could start a new rally. But if it doesn’t, the price could fall further to $73,000. At the same time, Bitcoin options data shows that more traders are betting on Bitcoin dropping to $70,000. This suggests that some investors believe the market could get even worse.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-28 05:08:22

ADA is now consolidating losses and at risk of more losses below the $0.60 level. ADA price started a fresh decline below the $0.6850 and $0.650 levels. The price is trading below $0.6550 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.660 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears the $0.70 resistance zone. Cardano Price Dips Further After a decent increase, Cardano faced resistance near the $0.70 zone. ADA formed a short-term top and recently started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . There was a move below the $0.6850 and $0.6650 levels. The bears were able to push the price below $0.6350. A low was formed at $0.6016 and the price is now consolidating losses. It is still below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $0.6769 swing high to the $0.6016 low. Cardano price is now trading below $0.650 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.620 zone. The first resistance is near $0.640 and the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $0.6769 swing high to the $0.6016 low. The next key resistance might be $0.660. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.660 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. If there is a close above the $0.660 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $0.680 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $0.70 in the near term. More Losses in ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $0.660 resistance level, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $0.60 level. The next major support is near the $0.5850 level. A downside break below the $0.5850 level could open the doors for a test of $0.550. The next major support is near the $0.50 level where the bulls might emerge. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ADA/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone.

Is it the community, the hype, or the potential for massive gains? This week, three trending meme coins are catching the attention of investors looking for opportunities. BTFD Coin (BTFD) continues its record-breaking presale, Just A Chill Guy (CHILLGUY) is riding a 25.9% weekly surge, and Bonk (BONK) is stabilizing after its latest 3.5% gain. Meme coins have evolved beyond just internet jokes—they’ve become serious contenders in the crypto space. BTFD Coin is redefining investor incentives with its referral program and massive staking rewards, while Just A Chill Guy embraces the chill meme culture and Bonk continues to dominate Solana’s meme scene. Let’s break down what makes these three meme coins some of the best cryptos for beginners right now . BTFD Coin: Bulls Squad Expands as Referral Rewards Boost Investors Can a single meme coin redefine the way people invest in crypto? BTFD Coin is making a strong case for it. The presale has already raised over $6.21 million, with more than 70 billion tokens sold and a community of 11,100+ holders growing daily. Unlike traditional meme coins, BTFD is packed with real-world utility, including a play-to-earn (P2E) game, staking rewards of up to 90% APY, and an explosive referral program—one of the key reasons it’s among the best cryptos for beginners right now. The BTFD referral program is turning heads, giving investors 10% of the raise amount in BTFD tokens if they rank in the top 20 referrers. This means that active community members can earn a significant portion of their investment back just by spreading the word. With its Stage 14 price at just $0.00016, investors see the opportunity for a potential 3650% ROI when it lists at $0.006—a moonshot that’s drawing in new buyers by the minute. Investing in BTFD Coin now could be like getting in early on a future meme coin giant. A $10,000 investment at $0.00016 would secure over 62.5 million BTFD tokens, which at the projected $0.006 moon price could be worth $375,000. This kind of upside is what’s keeping investors glued to the presale. Buying BTFD Coin is simple. Set up MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load it with BNB or ETH, connect to the presale site , enter the purchase amount, confirm the transaction, and receive tokens once the presale ends.

There’s an absolute bloodbath on the Satoshi Street with BTC and other digital assets extending weekly losses to more than 20-25%. Crypto Market Crash Erases $900 Billion Ever since US President Donald Trump kickstarted the trade war on January 20, the crypto market crash led to erasing more than $900 billion in just over a month’s time. Since the Trump inauguration, the total crypto market cap has dropped from $3.7 trillion to $2.8 trillion. On the monthly chart, Bitcoin price is down more than 21% after facing rejection at $106K levels. BTC losses have further exacerbated after the asset lost the crucial support of $95K. Below is the chart of how Bitcoin has behaved after Trump announces trade wars with Mexico, Canada, and recently Europe. Source: The Kobeissi Letter Gold Takes the Limelight Over Bitcoin The recent development shows that BTC has been subject to market uncertainties and has behaved exactly opposite to the yellow metal gold, which has been trending higher. Throughout the trade war, the price of gold continued to inch higher, extending its year-to-date gains to nearly 10%. Gold has reclaimed its position as a favored global hedge amid uncertainty. Last week, Gold ETFs purchased an impressive 52 tonnes of the metal, marking the highest weekly inflow since July 2020. Over the past 12 months, gold prices have surged by more than 50%, recently achieving their best annual performance in over a decade. Source: The Kobeissi Letter How Low Can Bitcoin Price Fall? Crypto analyst Justin Bennett suggests that Bitcoin may be on track to close the $77,360 CME gap from November, potentially aligning with the September 2023 trendline. In a recent post, Bennett expressed skepticism about Bitcoin’s ability to maintain its current levels. “For Bitcoin to avoid a bearish outlook, it would need a miraculous February close above $92,000,” Bennett stated. However, he added, “The odds aren’t looking good.” Source: Justin Bennet BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes stated: “We are making lower lows in this current wave. I was tempted to add risk this morning, but looking at this price action I think we have one more violent wave down below $80k, most likely over the weekend, then crickets for a while”. On the other hand, CryptoQuant CEO still believes that the Bitcoin bull run hasn’t ended, and it is very unlikely that the Bitcoin price will fall under $77,000, in this crypto market crash. Ethereum (ETH) Leads Altcoins Crash to $2,100 Ethereum has been leading altcoins market crash, dropping an additional 8% today and moving all the way to $2,100. With today’s drop, ETH has completely erased its post-election rally. Ethereum has declined by nearly 50% from its peak following the late-2024 election. As of press time, ETH price is trading 7.74% down at $2,136, losing $30 billion in the last 24 hours. Source: TradingView Apart from ETH, some of the other top altcoins have also lost anywhere between 8-10%. XRP price has crashed 8% today, moving all the way to $2.0. Solana (SOL) also dropped by 8% to $126 levels, with dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA) seeing correction of a similar magnitude losing crucial support levels. In today’s crypto market crash, the overall crypto market liquidation has soared to more than $860 million as per Coinglass data . Of the total liquidations, $707 million has been in long liquidations alone. Crypto Market Faces Major Liquidity Crisis Tight liquidity conditions in the market have been the key reason behind the steep fall in the crypto market recently. Of the total monthly market correction, $760 billion have been eroded just within the last 60 hours, noted The Kobeissi Letter, in the absence of liquidity. Source: The Kobeissi Letter Much of the global liquidity is finding its way back into the US Dollar during ongoing trade tensions. Often seen as the “safest risky asset,” the USD benefits from its reputation as one of the world’s most stable currencies. Thus, the USD has been sucking out the liquidity from crypto and the rest og global markets.

In Texas, the Senate Banking Committee has advanced a bill that could establish a Bitcoin and cryptocurrency strategic reserve, positioning the state as a leader in digital asset adoption. Meanwhile, at the national level, Standard Chartered has projected that Bitcoin could reach $200,000 this year and potentially $500,000 before the end of President Donald Trump’s second term, citing increasing institutional adoption and evolving regulatory clarity. Bitcoin’s Path to $500K? Standard Chartered Sees Trump’s Presidency as a Net Positive for BTC The first month of Donald Trump’s presidency has been anything but stable for risk assets, but his administration could prove to be a long-term boon for Bitcoin, according to Standard Chartered. Despite recent volatility, the bank sees significant upside for the leading cryptocurrency, predicting a price surge to $200,000 this year and an eventual climb to $500,000 before the end of Trump’s second term. Geoffrey Kendrick, head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, made the bold projection in a recent interview with CNBC. He attributed the potential rally to growing institutional adoption and an increasingly favorable regulatory environment, both of which could propel Bitcoin to unprecedented heights. “It’s institutions like ours that now offer custody businesses that are much more secure than the hacks,” Kendrick noted. This sentiment reflects a broader trend where traditional financial institutions are playing a more active role in crypto markets. The approval and launch of multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US have driven institutional demand, reinforcing the narrative that Bitcoin is becoming a mainstream financial asset. While the long-term outlook appears optimistic, Bitcoin’s short-term price action has been far from smooth. After reaching an all-time high of $109,000 in January, BTC has since retraced to around $80,000, weighed down by macroeconomic concerns and geopolitical tensions. President Trump’s aggressive trade policies—particularly his renewed tariff threats against China, Canada, and Mexico—have rattled global markets, contributing to Bitcoin’s recent correction. The Kobeissi Letter, a well-regarded market commentary platform, pointed out that Bitcoin’s sharp reaction to tariff threats shows its growing correlation with equities and broader liquidity conditions. Historically viewed as a hedge against traditional markets, Bitcoin now appears more intertwined with macroeconomic events than ever before. Despite the short-term turbulence, industry experts believe Bitcoin remains in a strong bull cycle. Global Macro Investor analyst Julien Bittel emphasized that corrections are normal in bull markets, particularly following a sharp run-up in price after the US presidential election. Meanwhile, Jamie Coutts, chief crypto analyst at Real Vision, highlighted that two out of three key liquidity indicators have turned bullish despite the recent downturn. Expanding central bank balance sheets and increasing global money supply typically create a favorable backdrop for Bitcoin’s price appreciation. The final piece of the puzzle, according to Coutts, is the US dollar’s trajectory—if the greenback weakens, Bitcoin’s upward momentum could accelerate. Security Concerns Remain a Challenge While institutional players are bringing credibility and legitimacy to the crypto sector, security risks remain a major concern. The recent $1.4-billion hack of crypto exchange Bybit is a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities still present in digital asset markets. Standard Chartered’s prediction of a $500,000 Bitcoin hinges on a combination of factors, including regulatory clarity, institutional investment, and macroeconomic shifts. If Trump’s policies lead to greater financial uncertainty or currency devaluation, Bitcoin could benefit as investors seek non-traditional stores of value. As the crypto market continues to evolve, Bitcoin’s ability to weather volatility and attract mainstream adoption will be critical in determining whether it can reach—and sustain—these ambitious price targets. Texas Moves Forward With Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Bill, Setting Precedent for US States In related news, the Texas Senate Banking Committee unanimously approved Senate Bill 21 (SB-21), which proposes the establishment of a Bitcoin and cryptocurrency strategic reserve. The 9–0 vote on Feb. 27 clears the path for the bill to advance to the Texas Senate floor for further deliberation, where it could become one of the most significant state-level cryptocurrency policies in the US. If passed, the bill would authorize the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts to acquire, sell, and trade digital assets as part of the state’s financial reserves. Advocates argue that Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies offer a hedge against inflation and economic volatility, providing Texans with enhanced financial security. The passage of SB-21 in the committee follows growing interest among US states in adopting Bitcoin as a financial safeguard. Oklahoma, Arizona, and Utah are also considering similar legislation to diversify their state reserves, reflecting broader concerns over the declining purchasing power of the US dollar and rising inflation. The bill originally focused exclusively on Bitcoin when it was first introduced by Texas State Senator Charles Schwertner in January 2025. However, following US President Donald Trump’s executive order on Jan. 23, which directed a commission to study the feasibility of a ”digital asset stockpile,” the bill was revised to include other digital assets in February. This shift aligns with Trump’s broader crypto-friendly stance, reinforcing his administration’s push to integrate digital assets into state and national economic strategies. While the move has been widely celebrated among Bitcoin supporters, some analysts remain cautious. Iliya Kalchev, an analyst at crypto platform Nexo, noted that the Feb. 18 public hearing for SB-21 was more symbolic than an immediate Bitcoin adoption or price catalyst. However, Pierre Rochard, vice president of research at Riot Platforms, a major Bitcoin mining company, provided testimony in support of the bill. He highlighted that while Texas currently enjoys a strong economy, it must prepare for future economic downturns and fiscal uncertainty. ”Public trust in financial institutions has eroded due to a lack of transparency, but Bitcoin is unique because it is fully auditable,” Rochard emphasized. His testimony echoed growing concerns that traditional financial systems are becoming increasingly fragile, with government overspending, debt accumulation, and inflation threatening long-term economic stability. Texas: A Crypto and Bitcoin Mining Hub Texas has long been a pro-crypto state, hosting some of the largest Bitcoin mining operations in the US due to its low electricity costs and deregulated energy market. The state has also enacted pro-mining legislation and has positioned itself as a leader in blockchain innovation. The introduction of a Bitcoin-backed reserve fund would further cement Texas’ status as a Bitcoin-friendly jurisdiction, potentially attracting even more investment and crypto businesses. However, challenges remain. If passed, the bill would require Texas to develop a framework for securely managing digital assets, including issues related to custody, price volatility, and regulatory oversight. Texas’ move to establish a Bitcoin strategic reserve could set a precedent for other US states to follow. If successful, it may lead to wider state-level Bitcoin adoption and force federal regulators to reassess their stance on Bitcoin and crypto-backed reserves. The potential expansion of state-level Bitcoin adoption also signals a shift in how policymakers view digital assets—not just as speculative investments but as legitimate financial instruments capable of hedging against inflation and financial instability. If Bitcoin is increasingly recognized as a strategic reserve asset, it could pave the way for broader government adoption, including federal reserves or even sovereign Bitcoin holdings in the future. The unanimous approval of SB-21 by the Texas Senate Banking Committee is a historic milestone in Bitcoin's integration into traditional financial systems. While some analysts remain skeptical about its immediate impact, the bill represents a growing recognition of Bitcoin’s role in financial security. With Trump’s executive order pushing for further digital asset integration, Texas may be at the forefront of a new era of Bitcoin adoption at the state level. If passed into law, SB-21 could mark the beginning of Bitcoin’s formal role in state financial reserves, setting the stage for broader institutional and governmental acceptance in the years ahead.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|REGULATION|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-28 05:30:00
33767162,[object Object],1740720627,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Panic Selling Bitcoin Now Is A Mistake – Crypto Expert Explains Market Dynamics,https://bitcoinist.com/panic-selling-bitcoin-now-is-a-mistake-crypto-expert-explains-market-dynamics/,"Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading below key demand levels after losing the $90K mark earlier this week. The price has tagged fresh lows, and bulls have lost control as the market faces intense selling pressure. BTC has dropped 14% in less than three days, entering a panic selling phase as investors react to market uncertainty. The sudden drop has sparked fear and speculation, with some analysts calling for a bear market while others remain optimistic about BTC’s long-term outlook. Despite this sharp correction, some crypto experts argue that panic selling at this stage is a rookie mistake. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju shared key metrics on X displaying BTC’s price drawdown after price discovery, pointing out that these types of corrections are historically normal in bull markets. According to Ju, if you’re panic selling now, you’re probably a noob—implying that this is a typical shakeout designed to flush out weak hands before the next rally. With Bitcoin’s price struggling below $90K , the next few days will be crucial to determine whether BTC stabilizes and recovers or continues to break lower toward deeper demand levels. Bitcoin Faces A Correction Phase Bitcoin has faced its biggest correction of the year, with the price struggling below the $90K level as investor fear and uncertainty dominate the market. The sudden drop has shaken confidence, and speculation about a potential bear market is rising as BTC sets new lows. Despite the sharp decline, top analysts are still watching for key confirmation levels. The market is at a critical point, where BTC could either consolidate below $90K for an extended period or see a strong push above $95K to confirm a recovery rally. The next few days will be crucial in determining whether Bitcoin stabilizes or faces further downside pressure. Ki Young Ju’s key insights about the correction explain that a 30% pullback in a Bitcoin bull cycle is common. He reminds investors that in 2021, BTC dropped 53% during its bull market yet still recovered to reach a new all-time high. Ju warns against emotional trading, stating that buying when prices rise and selling when they fall is the worst investment strategy. Ju emphasizes that investors should have a clear plan rather than reacting impulsively. While the recent price action looks scary, historical trends suggest that this type of correction is normal in a long-term Bitcoin bull run. BTC Testing Fresh Demand Level Bitcoin is currently trading at $86,400, hovering just above the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and 5% away from the 200-day Moving Average (MA). These key indicators serve as long-term support levels, and holding above them is crucial for bulls to prevent further downside. If BTC stabilizes at these levels, the next major step in reclaiming bullish momentum would be pushing above the $90K level. However, the market remains highly volatile, and this process could take time before the next major rally takes off. Investors are closely monitoring price action to see if Bitcoin can sustain a recovery phase or if another wave of selling pressure will push it into lower demand zones. Historically, when Bitcoin tests the 200-day MA, it often leads to a period of consolidation before a significant move. If bulls manage to reclaim the $90K mark and hold it as support, this would signal a potential uptrend resumption. However, failure to hold current levels could result in further declines, with $82K–$84K as the next key demand zone. For now, traders are waiting to see whether Bitcoin can defend its current levels or if a longer consolidation phase is needed before a breakout occurs.

According to MakroVision, Ethereum remains weak after falling below the lower orange support zone. ETH is currently trading near the lower Fibonacci support levels, making a reversal at this stage crucial to avoid further downside pressure. According to the analytics firm, if Ethereum manages to bounce, the key breakout zone is located between $2,810 and $2,880, along with a red trendline. This range serves as a crucial area for a potential trend reversal as it also houses several liquidity zones that could attract price action.

The announcement, made on Feb. 28 through Metamask’s official X account, marks a major update for the wallet, which has primarily focused on the Ethereum ( ETH ) ecosystem. The update will include a redesigned user interface, the ability to manage several seed phrases in a single wallet, and abstracted gas fees, which will enable users to pay for transactions using any token rather than ETH. We're overhauling the MetaMask UI/UX. 🦊 Not only that, we're bringing in developments that will level up the entire industry. Here's what we've been cooking. 🧵👇 pic.twitter.com/tPlKdWr9Bz — MetaMask.eth 🦊 (@MetaMask) February 28, 2025 In addition, the platform plans to launch smart transactions, a feature designed to prevent unsuccessful transactions and restrict MEV assaults. After Ethereum’s next Pectra upgrade, MetaMask will also introduce smart account features that will enhance the self-custody procedure. This version will make MetaMask a cross-chain wallet that prioritizes security and usability while managing assets from many blockchains.

As previously reported by crypto.news on Feb. 27, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has dropped its investigation on the Ethereum development company. Consensys was accused of operating as an unregistered securities broker, as part of a larger crackdown led by former SEC Chair Gary Gensler. However, the agency has softened its position and dismissed cases against Uniswap, Gemini, Coinbase, OpenSea, and Robinhood since interim Chair Mark Uyeda assumed office. Consensys founder and Ethereum co-creator Joseph Lubin called the decision a victory for the cryptocurrency industry. I'm pleased to announce that Consensys and the SEC have agreed in principle that the securities enforcement case concerning MetaMask should be dismissed. Subject to the approval of the Commission, the SEC will file a stipulation with the court that effectively closes the case.… — Joseph Lubin (@ethereumJoseph) February 27, 2025 Despite MetaMask’s continued dominance in the self-custody wallet market, competition is intensifying. Phantom, the most popular wallet on Solana ( SOL ), has grown to 15 million users since its launch in 2021. Phantom began as a Solana-only wallet but has since branched out to the Ethereum ecosystem. MetaMask’s recent roadmap indicates an attempt to hold on to its top spot in the rapidly changing cryptocurrency wallet space.

The US SEC has made it clear that meme coins , like TRUMP and other popular tokens, are not considered securities or investments that need to follow strict financial rules. Instead, the agency sees them more like collectibles—something people buy for fun rather than as a real financial asset. However, just because meme coins aren’t regulated like stocks doesn’t mean scammers can get away with fraud. The SEC warned that if someone uses meme coins to mislead people or run scams, they could still face legal trouble. The SEC has released guidance that memecoins are not securities and are akin to collectibles. https://t.co/8tRsuHHqbJ — David Sacks (@davidsacks47) February 27, 2025 Meme Coins: Not Securities, Says SEC According to the SEC’s latest statement , meme coins do not meet the legal definition of securities under the Securities Act of 1933. Unlike stocks or investment contracts, Meme coins don’t give holders any rights to future profits, income, or ownership in a company. Because of this, the SEC doesn’t require meme coin creators or traders to register with them, meaning they don’t have to follow the same rules as traditional investments. However, this also means investors won’t get the usual protections from the SEC, exposing them to the risk of fraud, pump-dump schemes, and misleading advertising. Legal experts, including Bain Capital Crypto’s Khurram Dara, highlighted that even though the SEC won’t directly regulate meme coins, other federal or state agencies could take action against deceptive practices to protect investors. A New Bill Emerges Before the SEC’s statement, House Democrats had already been pushing the Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement (MEME) Act, aimed at restricting public officials from launching or endorsing meme coins. The bill, spearheaded by California Representative Sam Liccardo, came in response to Donald Trump’s controversial “ TRUMP” meme coin , which saw a dramatic rise and fall in value. Lawmakers fear that such tokens could be exploited for personal or political gain, raising ethical concerns. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto News: Consensys Wins Big as SEC Drops Case Over MetaMask Wallet , Crypto Community Reacts The SEC’s stance has sparked mixed reactions in the crypto space. Some industry players see it as a positive move, arguing that regulatory clarity will encourage more investment in meme coins, particularly on US-based blockchains like Solana . Crypto lawyer Ishmael Green noted that with meme coins officially outside securities laws, exchanges like Coinbase and Robinhood may feel more confident listing them, which could lead to a surge in market activity. Following the announcement, shares of major crypto exchanges saw a slight uptick, reflecting optimism within the industry. Meanwhile, in a surprising turn, the SEC is dropping its lawsuits against Coinbase, Consensys, and Gemini, signaling a positive change for crypto assets. With the MEME Act on the horizon and the SEC shifting gears, the regulations scene for crypto—especially meme coins—is changing fast. Whether these changes bring more clarity or confusion remains to be seen. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

40944970,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=683974,1740721664,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40944970.jpeg,Judge blocks Elon Musk’s DOGE from mass-firing federal workers,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/judge-blocks-elon-musk-doge-firing/,"On Thursday, Federal Judge William Alsup told the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to cancel its earlier orders from Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) that told agencies to “promptly determine” whether certain employees should stay or be fired. The judge didn’t just stop the terminations—he called the entire process illegal and said it should have never happened in the first place. The OPM had sent out a January 20 memo and a February 14 internal email, both pushing agencies to decide the fate of probationary employees. Alsup wasn’t having it. He ordered OPM to notify the Department of Defense that those terminations were invalid—and he wants this done before the planned firings happen. He also ordered a hearing, where acting OPM Director Charles Ezell will have to testify. No date has been set yet. Judge: OPM had no right to order mass firings Alsup made it clear that OPM had no legal authority to force these agencies to fire employees. “The Office of Personnel Management does not have any authority whatsoever under any statute in the history of the universe to hire and fire employees within another agency,” he said. “It can hire its own employees, yes. Can fire them. But it cannot order or direct some other agency to do so.” He also called probationary workers “the lifeblood of our government”—people who enter at lower levels and move up over time. The government, he said, depends on them to keep things running. The lawsuit against DOGE came from unions, including the American Federation of Labor, arguing that Musk’s agency was violating the Privacy Act and the Administrative Procedure Act by trying to access Labor Department data. Judge John Bates of Washington, D.C., ordered at least one DOGE official to testify and hand over documents, marking the first time someone inside D.O.G.E has been legally forced to answer questions under oath from an outside attorney. Bates called D.O.G.E “opaque”, meaning the agency operates with little transparency. The ruling could reveal how DOGE really functions inside the federal system and what data it has access to. DOGE under fire for secrecy and overreach Bates also approved four depositions with staffers at the Department of Health and Human Services, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Labor Department, and D.O.G.E. The unions pushing the case want proof that D.O.G.E is illegally accessing federal records. The judge ruled that these depositions should be limited to eight hours total, but it’s unclear if the public will ever see them. The unions that filed the lawsuit are seeking to block DOGE from accessing Labor Department data, arguing that access to such sensitive information systems would violate the Privacy Act and the Administrative Procedure Act. Another case against DOGE, filed by the Center for Biological Diversity, argues that the agency is dodging federal transparency laws. This group, which focuses on protecting the environment, says the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has refused to release information on D.O.G.E’s actions, despite Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) rules requiring federal agencies to disclose records upon request. D.O.G.E has faced over 20 lawsuits , but this is the first one focused entirely on transparency laws. The Center for Biological Diversity suit claims that because DOGE is deliberately moving quickly to cut government funding and staff, and its efforts will have effects on the environment (the Environmental Protection Agency has said D.O.G.E helped it make significant cuts, for instance), it’s urgent to uncover more details about how D.O.G.E operates. The FOIA lawsuit argues that the government should not be allowed to make drastic staffing cuts in secrecy. “FOIA was designed to ensure that monumental and consequential undertakings such as this could not take place without transparency,” the lawsuit says. It also warns that D.O.G.E’s staffing cuts could “harm, undermine, or negate” federal climate protections, land management, and public health regulations. Government argues it was just ‘guidance’ There was a major dispute over whether OPM’s mid-February calls to agencies were actual orders or just “requests”. Alsup wasn’t convinced. He pointed out that when something happens at the same time across multiple agencies, it sounds more like an order than mere “guidance.” “Something aberrational happens, not just in one agency, but all across the government, in many agencies on the same day, the same thing,” Alsup said. “Doesn’t that sound like to you that somebody ordered it to happen, as opposed to, ‘Oh, we just got guidance’?” Assistant U.S. Attorney Kelsey Helland, the government’s lawyer, disagreed. “An order is not usually phrased as a request,” she argued. “Asking is not ordering to do something.” She suggested that impacted employees should take their cases to the Office of Special Counsel or the Merit Systems Protection Board instead of seeking a restraining order. Danielle Leonard, an attorney for the unions, pushed back. “Are they really contending to this court that all of these federal employees are lying, Your Honor?” she asked. “That’s what counsel is saying. I don’t think it’s credible.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Both the stock market and crypto assets like Bitcoin are showing significant declines. This week, Bitcoin ETFs saw massive outflows. On Monday, over $500 million left, followed by a staggering $11 billion outflow on Tuesday, the largest in history. Wednesday saw another record with $754 million leaving the Bitcoin ETFs, particularly affecting the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF. In response to the outflows, BlackRock had to sell a record amount of Bitcoin on Wednesday to fulfill the withdrawal requests, marking the largest single-day Bitcoin sale for the ETF provider. As for Bitcoin price, the largest cryptocurrency has dipped below $80,000 and most altcoins have followed suit. XRP is down by more than 9% and is dangerously close to dropping below the $2 mark. Over the last 24 hours, XRP has confirmed a daily candle close below a crucial support zone between $2.25 and $2.30. According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, this area has previously shown multiple bounces, making it a key level for traders. With this break, the next significant support lies between $1.95 and $2. Next Major Support at $2 If the price drops below the $2 level, specifically under $1.95 or $1.90, it could signal more major losses for XRP. This would likely lead to much lower price levels in the near future. Current Bearish Trend XRP is currently in a bearish trend, marked by breaking below support levels, rejecting resistance, and forming lower highs and lows. This bearish price action suggests further downward movement in the short term.

The lawsuit, claiming XRP was sold as an unregistered security, has drawn attention as the SEC recently dropped several high-profile cases. If the SEC dismisses the appeal, XRP’s price could surge, with analysts predicting a potential rally to $3.20 following Ripple’s previous legal victories. February 28, 2025 06:13:02 UTC Pi Network Listing on Binance Gains Support with 86% Community Vote Binance has completed a community vote that may lead to the listing of Pi Coin (PI) on the platform. With 86% of the 294,957 participants voting in favor, this marks a significant move toward integrating Pi Network’s native cryptocurrency into Binance’s offerings. However, Binance clarified that the vote results are for reference only, and the decision will be subject to further evaluation. Pi Coin, which has grown to over 60 million members, saw a 20.8% price drop following its ATH but has still outperformed the broader crypto market. The Pi Network community is also looking forward to Pi Day on March 14, 2025, which could bring further excitement and developments for the coin. February 28, 2025 06:07:13 UTC When Will Crypto Go Back Up? After recent corrections, the market appears to have found a solid demand zone, potentially setting up for a bounce. Bitcoin ($BTC) could reach $97K-$100K, Ethereum ($ETH) may hit $3K, and altcoins could experience a 10%-30% rally. This bounce may be triggered not only by technical factors but also by NVIDIA’s record-breaking earnings and the upcoming US PCE Price Index data. Investors are watching closely as the Fed evaluates its policies based on this data, which could influence market movements further. February 28, 2025 05:46:55 UTC Bitcoin News Today : BTC Price Crash Below $80K Bitcoin’s spot volume surged around the $100K mark, but during distribution phases, prices tend to drop when new liquidity dries up. The key question now is where fresh liquidity will come from to sustain a bullish trend. With limited new liquidity entering the market, an extended consolidation within a wide range ($75K-$100K) seems likely, similar to early 2024. This range-bound movement could persist until favorable news for Bitcoin triggers new liquidity inflows. February 28, 2025 05:46:55 UTC What Happened To Crypto Today? Bitcoin (BTC) fell below its 200-day simple moving average (SMA) on Friday, marking a 16% weekly loss and briefly dipping below $80,000 for the first time since November 10. The decline was fueled by renewed concerns over U.S. tariffs, which boosted demand for the U.S. dollar. Altcoin like XRP, Solana (SOL), and DOGE saw even steeper losses, with XRP dropping below the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level. President Trump’s announcement of tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China further fueled the rise in the dollar, pushing the dollar index to 107.30.",News|Crypto Live News Today,EN,0,0,BTC|XRP|MARKET|TRADING|SOL|ALTCOIN|BNB|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-28 05:58:28

The proposed legislation seeks to ban senior US officials and their family members from engaging in the issuance, sponsorship, or endorsement of digital assets, securities, and commodities. This move comes in direct response to the launch of the $TRUMP meme coin, a cryptocurrency tied to former President Donald Trump, which has faced significant volatility since its debut. Although the MEME Act is unlikely to pass under the current Republican-led Congress, its introduction signals growing concern over political figures leveraging digital assets for personal financial gain. If Democrats regain control in the 2026 midterm elections, the bill’s prospects could improve, potentially forcing Trump to return any profits made from the controversial token. The debate raises broader questions about regulatory oversight and ethical boundaries in the crypto space, particularly as political figures increasingly embrace Web3. Trump-linked tokens spark concerns The timing of the $TRUMP and $MELANIA tokens’ launches—just days before the US presidential inauguration—has fueled accusations of financial exploitation. Source: Coingecko The $TRUMP coin saw an initial surge to over $74, only to crash 82% from its peak, while the $MELANIA token has plummeted 93% from its all-time high. Source: Coingecko Despite Trump’s previous advocacy for a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment, his direct association with these digital assets has drawn criticism. Investors who suffered heavy losses have taken to social media, questioning whether political figures should have such influence over speculative markets. The volatility of these tokens has also raised concerns about potential insider trading and foreign financial influence over the executive branch. This is not the first time the former president has ventured into the Web3 space. Trump previously launched a series of NFTs, a move that mirrored a broader trend of politicians experimenting with blockchain-based assets. With the MEME Act now on the table, lawmakers are signalling that such activities by public officials may soon face stricter scrutiny. Crypto bill faces legislative hurdles While the MEME Act has little chance of passing in the current political climate, its introduction highlights the increasing legislative focus on cryptocurrency ethics. The bill’s failure would not necessarily mean the issue will fade, as calls for greater transparency and accountability in political finance continue to grow. Regulating the participation of elected officials in crypto markets could set a precedent for broader industry-wide reforms. Some analysts argue that, even if the MEME Act does not pass, its proposed restrictions on digital asset endorsements could inspire similar measures in future financial regulation bills. A complete ban on political involvement in digital currencies is unlikely, but lawmakers may push for disclosure requirements and independent oversight as alternative solutions. This could help ensure that public officials are held accountable while allowing legitimate crypto industry growth to continue. Regulation aims to restore trust The MEME Act underscores a broader debate about the ethical implications of public servants engaging in speculative investments. Trust in democratic institutions relies on a clear separation between political power and personal financial gain, yet the growing involvement of politicians in crypto-related ventures blurs these lines. With increasing regulatory efforts in the cryptocurrency space, from Biden’s executive order on digital assets to Europe’s MiCA framework, the MEME Act is part of a global movement towards ensuring that financial markets operate transparently. Whether the legislation moves forward or not, it has sparked an important conversation about the role of elected officials in emerging financial markets. Ultimately, the battle over cryptocurrency regulation is far from over. As digital assets continue to evolve, lawmakers will need to balance market innovation with ethical governance, ensuring that no public figure can exploit their political influence for private financial gain.
