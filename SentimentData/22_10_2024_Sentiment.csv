DeFiLlama says the platform manages over $109 million worth of assets. It continues to expand and improve as decentralized financial services find traction. Stacks Network Activating Nakamoto On October 29 Over five years after launching, the network is preparing for one of its most important upgrades: Nakamoto. Analysts and platform supporters claim this update would have far-reaching implications, especially for its ecosystem. Related Reading: Ripple At A Critical Juncture Like Amazon In 1997, Says Investment Pro The team said the latest update would go live on October 29. Most importantly, the transition will introduce features that boost throughput and security. On scalability, Stacks might be looking to march Ethereum layer-2s that currently process transactions cheaply and can host transaction-intensive dapps. Once the upgrade activates, Stacks will decouple from the Bitcoin block production speed of roughly 10 minutes. The decoupling will see the platform process transactions within seconds. The change means Stacks will handle more transactions, process them faster, and improve the user experience. However, the team said this decoupling won’t mean the end of the relationship between stackers and Bitcoin miners. In the team’s view, not only will the collaboration be enhanced, but Stacks as a layer-2 will be more decentralized and, therefore, robust. Since Stacks is a layer-2, relying on Bitcoin for security, all transactions would still have to be confirmed on the base layer. Accordingly, though its transaction mining will be decoupled from the layer-1, all transactions will be finalized on the Bitcoin mainnet. This confirmation will be irreversible, leading to better security without the risk of transaction reversals. STX Moving Inside A Mega Consolidation: Will Bulls Break $2? As bullish as the Nakamoto upgrade may be, STX, the native token, is flatlining. From the daily chart, the coin is stuck inside a mega consolidation from early July. Related Reading: Solana Bulls Push Past $164 Barrier, Momentum Signals More Gains STX prices are moving between $1.20 and $2. The token has steadily recovered after crashing in early August, adding nearly 60%. Nonetheless, for the uptrend to take shape and buyers to initiate steps of peeling back March to July losses, there must be a decisive breakout above $2. If this leg up is with rising volume, it could trigger a wave of higher highs, mirroring those from early Q4 2023 to mid-March. STX may soar to $4 in that event, nearly doubling from September highs.

Why Muted Volume Could Trigger Major Crash",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-headed-for-35720/,"Alan Santana, a crypto analyst on TradingView, has predicted that the Bitcoin price could potentially experience a drastic decline to new lows around $35,720, driven by muted buying volume. The analyst has declared that the current state of the market is bearish, highlighting potential manipulation from whale investors. Bitcoin Price Could Crash To $35,720 According to Santana, Bitcoin has witnessed 75 days of bullish activity but has not reached projected new price peaks, currently trading within a lower high below $70,000. While the cryptocurrency did hit an All-Time High (ATH) in March, surging past $73,000, Santana has concluded that the general market has become relatively bearish. Related Reading: Dogecoin Flashes Sell Signal After 30% Rally – Time To Sell? He disclosed that most of the Bitcoin price action between August 5 and to present day is forming part of an inverted correction, which suggests that prices have been rising but without reaching new peaks. Santana also declared that the current Bitcoin price action confirms that there is no bullish momentum. He attributed this lack of momentum to muted whale activities, highlighting that there are currently no buyers or buying volume at the current market level. Due to these bearish conditions, Santana has predicted that Bitcoin could end up crashing to $35,720, representing a massive 46.68% decrease to new lows. This also means that Bitcoin’s price will drop by almost half, triggering panic and fear amongst retail and whale investors. Contrary to Santana’s bearish analysis, the price of Bitcoin is up by 5.56% and trading at $68,203, according to CoinMarketCap. The cryptocurrency is gradually increasing to reach the $70,000 mark, driven by positive changes in market sentiment and the historically bullish Q4. Although Santana has stayed firm in his bearish predictions of Bitcoin due to limited buying power, the analyst has also received severe backlash from various crypto community members. One member criticized Santana’s bearish Bitcoin prediction, suggesting that there were flaws in his analysis. Others accused the analyst of attempting to manipulate investors by using a Bitcoin chart from a Blofin exchange, which typically has lower transaction activity. Bitcoin Market Manipulation And Bears Despite the heat from crypto members, Santana believes that market manipulation has led to the current bearish price action in Bitcoin. The analyst highlights that Bitcoin’s price can be artificially manipulated by large holders or so-called Whales. Related Reading: FLOKI Breaks Out Of Downtrend: Analyst Predicts 200% Rally To New All-Time High He stated that these whales can push the price of Bitcoin up hoping that retail investors will dive into the market and buy, ultimately triggering a bullish wave. According to Santana, if there are no genuine Bitcoin buyers, the alleged manipulation could backfire, possibly leading to losses for said market manipulators. Santana has revealed that retail investors are no longer easily fooled into buying Bitcoin at the top, showing more caution due to previous cycles of manipulation and hype. He also disclosed that buyers are not swayed by exaggerated predictions of substantial future gains by analysts, claiming that Bitcoin could reach $3,000,000.

This rise in inflows comes amid the gradual recovery of top crypto assets last week, with the majority now reclaiming major highs and registering nearly double-digit gains over the past 7 days. Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Price Reach A New All-Time High? This Golden Cross Suggests So Who Led the Charge? Bitcoin-based products were the standout beneficiaries of last week’s inflows. US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) added $2.1 billion, with BlackRock’s IBIT ETF alone generating over $1.1 billion. The cumulative inflows for these Bitcoin ETFs, which began trading in January, now stand at $21 billion. These funds have grown to manage a record $66 billion in assets under management, highlighting their significant role in the market. Notably, the renewed confidence in Bitcoin products mirrors earlier this year’s positive sentiment. Last week’s inflows were the largest since March, when US spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $2.6 billion as Bitcoin reached its all-time high above the $73,000 price mark. This strong demand suggests that investors remain bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term prospects, despite recent market fluctuations. While Bitcoin stole the spotlight, other cryptocurrencies also experienced inflows last week although way lesser than that of BTC. Ethereum-based products attracted $58 million in net inflows, while Solana, Litecoin, and XRP-based funds saw smaller inflows of $2.4 million, $1.7 million, and $700,000, respectively. However, multi-asset investment products did not fare well, experiencing net outflows of $5.3 million, ending a 17-week streak of consecutive inflows. What Prompted The Surge In Crypto Inflow? According to CoinShares, this surge in inflows is tied to growing optimism about the upcoming US elections, with a potential Republican victory driving investor sentiment. Many believe that a Republican administration would favor the digital asset market more favorably, leading to an increase in investor confidence and positive price momentum. James Butterfill, Head of Research at CoinShares, particularly noted: We believe this renewed optimism stems from growing expectations of a Republican victory in the upcoming US elections, as they are generally viewed as more supportive of digital assets. Notably, Butterfill, reiterated these views, adding that trading volume for these investment products surged by 30% last week. Total assets under management (AUM) for crypto funds are now nearing the $100 billion mark on a global scale, highlighting the substantial interest in digital assets.

The first key resistance is near the $68,750 level. A clear move above the $68,750 resistance might send the price higher. The next key resistance could be $69,200. A close above the $69,200 resistance might initiate more gains. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $70,000 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $70,500 resistance level. More Losses In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $68,000 resistance zone, it could start another decline.

This breakout signals a confirmed uptrend, sparking excitement among investors as Solana continues to push higher. With the market showing renewed optimism, analysts set bullish price targets for Solana’s next potential moves. Related Reading: Ethereum Upside Target Around $2,800 As Price Tests Key Resistance Top analyst and investor Carl Runefelt recently shared valuable insights on Solana’s outlook, boldly predicting that Solana could reach $370 in the coming months. He believes that the altcoin is set for a significant rally once Solana breaks above its current high timeframe bullish pattern. Investors are closely watching for confirmation of this bullish trend, anticipating further gains as Solana’s price action gains momentum. Solana’s recent breakout and positive market sentiment suggest a strong performance shortly. Solana Prepares For A Rally Solana is on the verge of a move, potentially reaching yearly or even all-time highs. The bullish outlook across the market continues to signal positive gains for SOL in the coming months. Crypto analyst Carl Runefelt recently shared a technical analysis on X, stating that Solana could go parabolic starting today. He highlights that SOL is breaking out of a massive Cup & Handle pattern, a classic bullish formation often seen on higher timeframes. Solana could rally toward a potential target of $370 if this pattern plays out. The Cup & Handle pattern is known for its reliability in signaling strong price movements, particularly when the handle completes and breaks upward. In Solana’s case, this breakout could lead to substantial gains, pushing the price to new highs. As the crypto market continues with momentum, SOL investors are optimistic about the potential price surge in the coming days. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaks Above $0.12 Level – Time For DOGE To Catch Up? With the bullish sentiment surrounding Solana, the next few weeks could be crucial in determining whether SOL can maintain its trajectory toward new highs. Investors may see significant returns if Solana breaks out and benefits from the market’s bullish sentiment. SOL Testing Supply Solana trades at $166 after successfully breaking above the key $160 resistance level. However, it faced rejection at the $171 supply zone. This level previously acted as minor support in late July and is now a resistance. If SOL manages to break above this resistance, the next target would be a higher supply level (around $188), where investors are likely to take profits or reposition. While the recent price action suggests strength, a healthy retrace to test the previous $160 resistance as support wouldn’t surprise investors. Such a pullback could provide a stronger foundation for SOL’s continued bullish momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaking Out Of 7-Month Accumulation Channel: Expert Predicts Further Upside The overall market sentiment remains optimistic, with many cryptocurrencies experiencing upward movement, which could further fuel Solana’s price action. If SOL holds above $160, it could confirm the next rally, positioning Solana for a surge in the coming weeks. Breaking through the $171 resistance will be critical in determining whether SOL can maintain its bullish trajectory.

It must stay above the $0.5250 support zone to attempt a fresh increase in the near term. XRP price is consolidating above the $0.5320 zone. The price is now trading below $0.5500 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $0.5500 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $0.5550 and $0.5580 resistance levels. XRP Price Trades In A Range XRP price remained stable above the $0.5320 support zone. It started a decent increase above the $0.550 level, but the bears were active near the $0.5600 resistance zone. A high was formed at $0.5600 before the price started to decline like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a decline below the $0.5550 and $0.550 levels. Besides, there was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $0.5500 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.5375 swing low to the $0.5600 high. The price is now trading below $0.5460 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The bulls are now protecting the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.5375 swing low to the $0.5600 high. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.5460 level. The first major resistance is near the $0.5500 level. The next key resistance could be $0.5550. A clear move above the $0.5550 resistance might send the price toward the $0.5600 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.5800 resistance or even $0.5880 in the near term. The next major hurdle might be $0.6000. Another Drop? If XRP fails to clear the $0.5500 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5420 level. The next major support is near the $0.5365 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5365 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $0.5320 support in the near term. The next major support sits near the $0.5250 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $0.5420 and $0.5365.

A high was formed at $611 and the price started a downside correction like Ethereum and Bitcoin. There was a move below the $605 and $600 levels. The price even dipped below $592 before the bulls appeared near $590. A low was formed at $591 and the price is now consolidating. It climbed above the $598 level and the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $611 swing high to the $591 low. The price is now trading below $600 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. If there is a fresh increase, the price could face resistance near the $602 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $611 swing high to the $591 low. The next resistance sits near the $610 level. A clear move above the $610 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $620. A close above the $620 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $632 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $650 level in the near term. More Losses? If BNB fails to clear the $605 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $592 level. The next major support is near the $588 level. The main support sits at $588. If there is a downside break below the $580 support, the price could drop toward the $575 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $565 level. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for BNB/USD is losing pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BNB/USD is currently below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $592 and $588. Major Resistance Levels – $605 and $612.",BNB|Binance Coin|BNB Price|bnbbtc|BNBUSD|bnbusdt,EN,0,0,TRADING|BNB|BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-10-22 05:58:16

This resistance has been in place for the last two quarters of the year, after BTC hit an all-time high of $73,700 back in March this year. Since then, the market has experienced price corrections and periods of consolidation, but recent bullish sentiment has sparked hope for a price resurgence as the year progresses. Could $70,000 Be Within Reach? Market analyst Rekt Capital has provided insights into Bitcoin’s current trajectory, emphasizing the recent uptrend and the potential for the cryptocurrency to regain the $70,000 mark. Notably, Rekt pointed out that Bitcoin has broken through a downtrending channel after surpassing the $65,000 level earlier this month, effectively invalidating a series of lower highs that had been established since mid-March. Related Reading: XRP Network Activity Surges As Price Seeks To Break $0.55 Resistance This breakout signifies the end of the previous downtrend. Rekt noted that Bitcoin had repeatedly failed to break above the channel’s resistance, but the most recent weekly close has shifted market sentiment. In his analysis, Rekt explains that Bitcoin is currently retesting its former resistance point above $69,000, suggesting that a successful retest could confirm the breakout and pave the way for further upside momentum. Rekt further explains that the current retest of lower support floors could see Bitcoin’s price dip to around $66,300, which is the channel top. This level has previously served as a significant barrier, preventing the price from reaching higher levels. Rekt pointed out that last week’s performance demonstrated the importance of this area, as Bitcoin closed above the lower high, setting the stage for a possible transition to higher levels if the aforementioned support holds. Key Resistance Challenge Ahead For Bitcoin If Bitcoin successfully retests this support level, the analyst expects that the next target would be the range high at approximately $71,500. This level marks a crucial challenge for Bitcoin, as it would signify the first attempt to breach the top of the re-accumulation range since June. Rekt goes on to argue that a successful move towards the area high above these levels would demonstrate that the previous resistance is weakening, further boosting BTC’s prospects of reaching higher levels. However, the question remains: how deep will any potential retracement be if Bitcoin faces rejection at the range high? Historically, since mid-March 2024, Bitcoin has encountered deeper rejections, with declines of 21% to 25% on August 5 and September 6 respectively. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Prediction: Crypto Analyst Says Things Are ‘About To Get Interesting’ Rekt concludes that BTC is moving deeper into a prior resistance area at $66,000, which may soon transform into support. A successful retest of this level could precede a significant reversal back to the $70,000 mark, reinforcing the bullish outlook for Bitcoin as it navigates through these critical price levels. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $67,350, registering a retracement of 2% in the 24-hour time frame.

New Staking Rules For VanEck’s Solana ETN Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, revealed that the Solana ETN, which trades under the ticker VSOL and currently has $73m in assets under management, will have rewards accrued and reinvested daily under the new staking rules, with the ultimate aim of attracting more investors and new capital. On the other hand, VanEck’s press release outlined how the staking process works for the Solana ETN. Importantly, the staking methods are designed to be non-custodial, meaning that the custodian of the ETN’s assets retains full control of the staked SOL, thereby eliminating lending risks typically associated with crypto investments. Related Reading: 7 Reasons To Be Bullish On Bitcoin This Week In addition, investors in the Solana ETN will not need to take any action to receive staking rewards. These rewards will be accounted for in the coin entitlement of the ETN, ensuring equitable distribution regardless of when the investment was made, minus a 25% staking fee. The staking rewards will be reflected in the daily end-of-day net asset value (NAV), with a cutoff point at 4 PM CET, allowing investors to benefit from staking without the “complexities” usually involved in managing crypto assets directly. The firm also instructs its custodian to delegate SOL to a validator node owned and maintained by a staking provider. Importantly, control of the delegated SOL remains with the custodian, ensuring security and stability. Once the SOL is delegated, the validator node earns various rewards, including inflationary and block rewards, accrued continuously. These rewards will be reinvested into the ETN daily, contributing to its overall performance. SOL Price Prediction The fifth-largest cryptocurrency, has shown significant price action over the past month, gaining approximately 10% and currently trading at $164.50. This recovery follows a significant drop to around $109 on August 5, signaling a strong rebound amidst a generally bullish market sentiment. Market expert Carl Runefelt recently highlighted Solana’s potential for further gains in a Monday social media post, stating that the token could “go parabolic starting today.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Watch Out: Miners Showing Unusual Exchange Inflow Activity Runefelt pointed out a significant technical pattern on the SOL/USDT daily chart, identifying a breakout from a “Cup and Handle” formation. This bullish pattern often signifies a strong upward momentum, with Runefelt projecting a potential price target of $370. Achieving this target would mean Solana surpassing its all-time high of $259, set in November 2021. This bullish outlook aligns with other analysts’ broader bullish predictions for the cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin, which is also expected to hit new highs in the coming months.

The analyst highlighted this in a post on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, disclosing how this return in retail demand could be one of the signs of a bull market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Watch Out: Miners Showing Unusual Exchange Inflow Activity Bitcoin Retail Activity Returns After 4-Month Decline The CryptoQuant analyst noted that on-chain transaction volumes of up to $10,000—a key indicator of retail investment—have increased by approximately 13% in the past 30 days. This marks a shift after four months, during which smaller investors were largely inactive. caueconomy wrote: Note that in the last 4 months we have seen a decrease in the activity of these small investors, while whales maintained a high amount of transactions and absorption of coins. The analyst further explained that the increase in small investor activity is typically more sensitive to market sentiment and news than fundamental factors. Additionally, it provides an early indicator of capital flows into the Bitcoin network. As mentioned by caueconomy, this rise in retail demand, which hasn’t been observed since March, could signal the beginning of a trend toward “lower risk aversion” among non-institutional market participants. Notably, this increase in small investor activity comes at a time when Bitcoin’s price has seen constant increase in the past week, with the cryptocurrency recently attempting to reclaim the $70,000 mark. An Outlook On BTC’s Price—72% Rally Next? While retail demand appears to be returning, Bitcoin faces a minor retracement after its recent attempt to break the $70,000 price mark earlier today. The crypto asset reached a high of $69,431 earlier today but has since fallen by 2.4% in the past 24 hours, bringing the current price down to $66,951. Despite this slight dip, market sentiment among analysts remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s future potential. One notable analyst, Javon Marks, recently took to X to express his bullish outlook for Bitcoin. Marks highlighted a potential 72% price increase that could push Bitcoin to $116,000 or higher. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales ‘Grew Substantially’ During Last Dip, Data Shows Large-Holder Accumulation According to his analysis, Bitcoin has been working around a key price level of $67,559. Despite the recent pullback, several bullish patterns—such as Hidden Bullish Divergences—suggest that Bitcoin may soon break above this level.

35006536,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649193,1729598432,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/35006536.jpeg,Top Crypto Analyst Unveils Strategy To ‘Make Millions’ By March 2025,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/top-crypto-analyst-plan-make-millions-march-2025/,"Crypto analyst Miles Deutscher, boasting 550,000 followers on X, has released a new video titled “My Plan To Make Millions In Crypto By March 2025! [Fool Proof Strategy].” In this analysis, Deutscher outlines his strategic approach to navigating the current crypto bull run. The Start Of The Bitcoin Bull Run First, Deutscher highlights the bullish outlook for Bitcoin, particularly on the monthly chart. “We have been consolidating above the high that we made in 2021 in February for a matter of eight months now,” he notes. “On the higher time frames, Bitcoin looks really, really good. It honestly looks primed for expansion for another leg potentially to take us to that $100,000 zone.” He attributes this bullish consolidation to significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, signaling increased interest from traditional finance investors. “Over $2 billion worth of inflows into the Bitcoin ETFs last week,” Deutscher reports. “We also saw, to end the week, another additional $273 million flowing into the Bitcoin ETF. The landscape is very strong here for Bitcoin from a TradFi perspective.” Despite this momentum, Bitcoin is lagging behind gold, which has surged 30% above its yearly high to $2,700 per ounce. “Bitcoin is still sitting 10% below its yearly high,” Deutscher points out. “If Bitcoin were to catch up to the current price performance of gold this year, that would indicate a Bitcoin price of $96,400, which would be absolutely insane.” Related Reading: Crypto Craze: Investor Nets A 3,360% Gain, Turning $86,000 Into $3.75 Million Deutscher also discusses the potential impact of macroeconomic factors and political events on Bitcoin’s trajectory. He observes a correlation between Bitcoin’s price performance and the election odds of former President Donald Trump. “It is quite interesting that Bitcoin is behaving very similarly to the Trump election odds based on Polymarket,” he remarks. While he acknowledges this could be coincidental, he suggests that “the market is anticipating a Trump win to be bullish for Bitcoin.” He also references the transition from quantitative tightening to quantitative easing and its potential effect on the crypto market. Citing a tweet, he poses the question: “What do you think happens when you leave a seven, actually eight-month trading range off a low historical volatility into an election with a transition from quantitative tightening to quantitative easing and at the end phase of an 18.6-year real estate cycle?” His answer: “Explosion.” Strategy How To “Make Millions” Turning his focus to altcoins, Deutscher provides a strategy for capitalizing on emerging market trends to potentially “make millions by March 2025.” He emphasizes the importance of strategic accumulation during market dips and highlights the significance of current uptrends. “Alts are now uptrending. We have started to break above the range. Bitcoin is uptrending. We are starting to break above key levels and make higher highs,” he explains. Deutscher advises against attempting to time market rotations between Bitcoin and altcoins. “You can play the game of timing the Bitcoin dominance rotation,” he acknowledges, but cautions that it requires precise timing. Instead, he recommends positioning for the “end game” by holding altcoins that are poised to outperform Bitcoin in the latter stages of its move. “Although that means I’m going to have to hold throughout periods of altcoin underperformance by the end of the cycle, I’m going to make more money playing that game,” he asserts. He stresses the importance of focusing on strong narratives and being selective with investments. Quoting Warren Buffett, he notes, “Diversification is a protection against ignorance. It makes very little sense for those who know what they’re doing.” Deutscher elaborates: “I think you should be selective. You don’t want to be over-diversified to the point where you hold six AI coins, six RWA coins, eight meme coins, five Layer-1s, three Layer-2s. This is a market where you’re better off to have maybe two plays from each narrative and just go higher conviction into those coins.” Key Narratives and Top Altcoin Picks Deutscher identifies several hot crypto narratives and specific altcoins that he believes have the potential to yield significant profits. In the memecoin sector, Deutscher highlights the emergence of AI-driven meme coins, where AI agents create and promote tokens. His leading play in this space is GOAT. “This narrative either goes to billions and really takes off and GOAT could be a one-billion-plus coin, or it goes to zero,” he admits, acknowledging the high risk involved. Besides AI memecoins, Deutscher recommends looking at the memecoin list by Murad Mahmudov. “I do think SPX6900 is a decent play. I also like GIGA, but probably not as much as SPX. I also like MOG. I like pretty much all of these but I think, you just gotta pick two or three that you resonate with the most.” Related Reading: Crypto Investment Products See Record $2.2 Billion Inflows—Is The Bull Run Here? Beyond meme coins, Deutscher is heavily investing in AI projects. He has taken positions in tokens like Bittensor and Near Protocol. “I’m meeting two to three AI founders a day. I’m really digging deep into AI research because it’s one of the verticals that I’m most interested in right now,” he shares. Deutscher also revealed his investments in projects that tokenize real-world assets, such as Mantra (OM), Ondo Finance (ONDO), and Pendle. While he has started taking profits from these investments due to significant gains, he is reallocating into projects like Clearpool (CPOOL), which he believes can “push up into that top-five echelon of RWA protocols.” He hints at another RWA project he’s bullish on but hasn’t publicly disclosed yet. Deutscher emphasizes the importance of accumulating crypto positions during market dips, especially in sectors poised for growth. He notes that the current market phase rewards dip buyers. “We’re in this new paradigm where we are getting higher lows. The market is actually rewarding those that buy these dips and take advantage of the dips,” he observes. He underscores the need for adaptability and disciplined risk management to maximize profits and potentially make millions. “You need to be evolving in the market in order to be profitable, and you need to be condensing positions that maybe aren’t so great or sexy or attractive for this next run into positions that are attractive,” he advises. Deutscher also cautions against fixating on arbitrary price targets or portfolio milestones. “Price targets are stupid,” he asserts. “The number one way that people wreck themselves last cycle was attaching themselves to arbitrary numbers like, ‘Oh, when I hit a million dollars, then I’ll cash out,’ or ‘Oh, when Bitcoin hits 100K, then I’ll cash out.'” Instead, he recommends implementing an incremental profit-taking system. “For each coin that you buy, have a plan to shift out set percentages at certain multiples,” he suggests. “This approach allows investors to secure gains progressively and adjust to market conditions without the need to predict exact peaks.” At press time, Bitcoin traded at $67,347.

The meme coin has jumped by over 30% during the past month, drawing both retail and analytical interest. Some analysts think SHIB may soon overcome a major resistance level with a community-driven rally bringing its market capitalization over $11 billion, therefore enabling even further gains. Related Reading: ApeCoin Climbs Over 100% On Major Tech Advancements – Details This thrill is driven mostly by a prediction from a pseudonymous analyst called FOUR. Fueled by what he describes as a “hyper meme coin cycle,” FOUR claims Shiba Inu is poised to hit new peaks. FOUR projects that a break above the $0.00002169 resistance level could send the price skyrocketing to $0.00003260, so indicating a possible 71% increase from SHIB, which is currently trading at $0.00001912. $SHIB is Marching towards $0.00003260 price very soon than you expect ⚡ Memes super cycle is just started #Shib #MemeSeason #MemeSupercycle pic.twitter.com/8QXXiE7odd — FOUR | Crypto Spaces (@X_Four_iv) October 19, 2024 Shiba Inu: Major Resistance Level At $0.00002169 For traders and experts, the resistance level of $0.00002169 now takes front stage. Previously tested during a late September rush, this pricing point was rejected. But SHIB’s present increasing momentum has rekindled hope that this barrier will soon be broken. Analysts contend that if SHIB surpasses this level, it could set off a quick price rise motivated by ongoing support from its large population. FOUR’s research fits this perspective. He points to the recent weekly candle close, implying that SHIB is getting closer to conquering its present obstacles. Shiba Inu might rapidly experience a notable increase in value if the resistance is overcome since the positive momentum has been growing. Retail Investors Promoting The Rally One may mostly credit Shiba Inu’s rise on the retail investor level. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that nearly 90% of SHIB holders are small investors holding anything from $0 to $1,000. The popularity of the coin has been driven by this grassroots support, hence increasing its resilience to changes in the market. The continuous rally can be attributed to retail investors believing in SHIB’s future for additional expansion. This is #SHIB analytics from #Coinmarketcap . The blue colors are owned by retail with $0-$1K bag holders . Almost 10% of holders have $1k-$100K bag value and only .20% have 100K and above SHIB Bag . These belongs to exchange .

Though rare, this group is important in the ecosystem and might perhaps include liquidity providers and exchanges. Related Reading: BONK Jumps 20% As ‘Dog Season’ Starts, Analyst Says Positive Viewpoint In Spite Of Volatility Though Shiba Inu has a history of instability, some market analysts see a bright future for it. The community-driven support of the currency along with the larger meme coin cycle might drive SHIB higher in the next coming weeks. FOUR’s estimate of a 71% increase depends on breaking important barriers. Investors will be closely observing to see if Shiba Inu can sustain its increasing pace and remove obstacles in its path.

Utilizing a quantile regression model, Sina identifies distinct phases in Bitcoin’s market cycle. Can Bitcoin Price Skyrocket Above $200,000? The model identifies the Cold Zone ( 66%), ranges from $136,000 to $285,000. This zone is characterized by heightened volatility and significant price swings as mass adoption peaks and leveraged positions become prevalent. While there is substantial room for upside, the risk of reversals escalates rapidly. Sina advises investors to either hold and enjoy potential gains or consider gradually exiting positions based on risk assessments, particularly since historical tops occur in the 90th to 99th quantile range. Notably, the 90th quantile starts at $211,000. What astonishes Sina is how these 33% quantile ranges align seamlessly with Bitcoin’s historical phase transitions. He notes that Bitcoin tends to spend exactly one-third of its time in each zone before transitioning to the next, almost like clockwork. This pattern means that most of the bear market occurs below the 33% quantile, while bull market euphoria begins above the 66% quantile. Renowned crypto analyst PlanC (@TheRealPlanC) acknowledged Sina’s model, commenting that it is a “perfect explanation—super clear.” Sina, in turn, credited PlanC for the foundational work that influenced his own model. Related Reading: 7 Reasons To Be Bullish On Bitcoin This Week PlanC has also recently updated his “Power Law Probability Model,” which forecasts Bitcoin prices ranging from $189,733 to $245,264 for the 97% to 99.9% quantile and $145,182 to $189,733 for the 90% to 97% quantile. He emphasizes that despite appearances, the underlying data follows a power-law relationship, independent of how it’s plotted—be it linear, log-linear, or log-log scales. “The data follows a log-log relationship with quantile regressions, whereas the rainbow chart uses logarithmic regression with a log-linear relationship. I am not ‘drawing’ these lines. These are quantile regressions of the log of price vs. time, based on all the data we have to date,” he explains. To contextualize the model’s predictive capabilities, PlanC elaborates on the significance of various quantiles. The 99.9% quantile means the price has been above this line only 0.1% of the time, equating to just one day out of every 1,000 days—a very rare event. The 99% quantile indicates the price has exceeded this line 1% of the time, or one day out of every 100 days, also considered rare. Conversely, the 0.1% quantile reflects that the price has fallen below this line only 0.1% of the time. At press time, BTC traded at $67,121.
