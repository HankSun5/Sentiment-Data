48499461,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=768971,1752877825,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/48499461.jpeg,"Jack Dorsey's Block is joining the S&P 500, stock surges by 10%",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/jack-dorseys-block-is-joining-the-sp-500/,"Block is getting bumped up to the S&P 500, and investors are not wasting time reacting. On Friday, shares of the company jumped more than 10% after hours, according to S&P Global, which announced that Block will replace Hess in the index starting before the opening bell on July 23. The shake-up follows Chevron’s $54 billion acquisition of Hess, completed after the oil giant came out on top in a legal fight with Exxon Mobil over drilling rights in Guyana. The change is one of two this week. On Monday, S&P Global also confirmed The Trade Desk will take over Ansys’ place after Synopsys closed its deal to acquire the software firm on Thursday. While most of these index swaps happen during regular quarterly rebalancing, mergers like this one fast-track the process. Last week, Datadog moved into the index to fill the spot left by Juniper Networks. Block takes the seat, tech gets bigger This latest move gives the index more tech weight, continuing a trend that’s been building for years. Block, which used to be called Square, was launched by Jack Dorsey in 2009. The company made a name for itself with sleek payment terminals before branching out into crypto, lending, and broader financial services. It rebranded as Block in 2021 to match its growing interest in blockchain infrastructure. Block’s rise into the S&P 500 puts it above many of its peers in terms of valuation. Even though its stock has dropped 14% this year, it still holds a market cap of around $45 billion, which is well above the median for companies in the index. For context, the Nasdaq is up over 8% this year, and the S&P 500 itself has gained about 7%, meaning Block’s underperformance hasn’t stopped it from climbing into the top tier. The stock jump didn’t come from better earnings or any new product drop. This is all about portfolio managers being forced to buy Block to track the S&P 500 exactly. When a company gets added to the index, massive funds have no choice but to load up. That buying pressure sent the price up instantly. Still, things haven’t exactly been smooth for the company. In May, Block reported first-quarter results that missed expectations, and it followed up with a downbeat forecast for the second quarter and the full year. That guidance came with a warning about the overall U.S. economy, especially following tariff actions by President Donald Trump that tightened conditions for a lot of businesses. “We recognize we are operating in a more dynamic macro environment, so we have reflected a more cautious stance on the macro outlook into our guidance for the rest of the year,” Block wrote in its latest quarterly filing. The next major checkpoint for the company is coming fast. Block is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings on August 7, after markets close. Investors, already tied to the stock through index exposure, will be watching closely.

The FPPE token fuels these platforms, providing incentives and rewards for creative engagement. Its ongoing “double your tokens” presale promo is driving massive traction, positioning FPPE as a meme coin with serious functionality. Chainlink (LINK): The Oracle Backbone of DeFi Chainlink remains the most trusted oracle network in the DeFi sector, connecting blockchains with off-chain data and real-world assets. With growing institutional collaborations like those with SWIFT and DTCC, LINK is expanding beyond retail DeFi use cases. Staking mechanisms and broader adoption of RWAs continue to strengthen Chainlink’s fundamentals. For investors focused on infrastructure and scalability, LINK continues to be a reliable long-term asset. Source: Coingecko – Chainlink Comparing Utility and Investor Incentives BTC Bull focuses on sentiment trading and caters to Bitcoin Maxis with limited direct utility. FloppyPepe offers AI meme tools and NFT creation, combining meme appeal with actual monetization features. OpenFundNet (OFNT) stands out with its zero-fee structure, allowing users to launch presales, DAOs, and staking platforms without coding. Qubetics integrates AI and blockchain for scalable infrastructure, focusing on real-world enterprise solutions. Real Utility Tokens Will Outlast the Hype Utility tokens are proving to be more than just short-term plays — they’re forming the backbone of the next crypto wave. While meme tokens like FloppyPepe inject energy into the space, it’s utility-rich assets like OpenFundNet that are powering the infrastructure behind the scenes. Whether through launching DAOs, staking platforms, or crowdfunding mechanisms, OFNT delivers real tools for real builders. For investors seeking long-term relevance and explosive upside, OFNT stands out as one of July’s most strategic allocations.

This Y Combinator-backed startup embarked on an ambitious journey to revolutionize how we interact with our computers using AI agents , specifically targeting the complex environment of Microsoft Windows. The Bold Vision for AI Agents in Windows Imagine a world where your computer understands and executes tasks seamlessly, driven by intelligent AI agents . This was the revolutionary promise of Pig.dev, a participant in Y Combinator’s Winter 2025 batch. Their initial focus was on developing agentic AI technology capable of controlling a Microsoft Windows desktop, a frontier many believe is crucial for AI’s broader integration into the workforce. The concept was akin to giving AI a pair of hands and eyes to navigate the digital world, automating complex workflows and boosting productivity. Unpacking the Challenges of Windows Automation Despite its visionary potential, the path to seamless Windows automation proved more challenging than anticipated for Pig.dev. While the idea of AI agents interacting with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) like Windows desktops holds immense promise, practical implementation faces significant hurdles. The Y Combinator podcast highlighted that long-term computer use by agents, extending beyond minutes to hours, remains a major stumbling block. As the context window for reasoning expands, an agent’s accuracy can waver, and the computational costs associated with large language models (LLMs) escalate dramatically. Pig.dev’s founder, Erik Dunteman, encountered a fundamental disconnect with the market. Customers in the legacy application automation space weren’t seeking a cloud API product or even a developer tool; they wanted a complete, hands-off solution. Essentially, they desired a consultant to build and manage their desired Windows robotic process automations, a service model Dunteman was unwilling to pursue, preferring to build scalable development tools instead. From Pig.dev to Muscle Mem: A Strategic Startup Pivot In May, facing these realities, Pig.dev announced a decisive startup pivot , abandoning its Windows automation efforts. Erik Dunteman shifted his company’s focus entirely to Muscle Mem, a novel cache system designed for AI agents. This strategic move was not a surrender but a re-evaluation of how best to tackle the core problems of AI agent efficiency. Muscle Mem’s purpose is to allow AI agents to offload repeatable tasks, freeing them to concentrate on complex reasoning, new problems, and handling edge cases. This approach directly addresses the challenges of accuracy and cost by optimizing how agents manage information and execute routine operations, chipping away at the ‘computer use’ problem from a different, yet equally vital, angle. Insights from the Y Combinator Podcast on Agentic AI The significance of Pig.dev’s journey and pivot was a central topic on a recent Y Combinator podcast, sparking a dynamic conversation among tech luminaries. YC partner Tom Blomfield likened Pig.dev’s original vision to ‘Browser Use’ – another YC alum that gained popularity for enabling AI agents to navigate web browsers by converting website elements into a text-like format. The podcast, featuring Amjad Massad (CEO of Replit), Blomfield, and YC partner David Lieb, underscored that while agentic technology is advancing, sustained, long-term computer interaction remains a significant hurdle. Blomfield even suggested that founders should explore applying technologies like Browser Use or Windows automation (like Pig.dev’s original concept) to specific enterprise verticals. Massad echoed this sentiment, stating, ‘The moment that technology works, those two companies are going to do really, really well.’ This dialogue highlights the immense market potential for solutions that truly unlock persistent AI agent capabilities. The Broader Landscape of AI Technology and Automation Pig.dev’s pivot underscores a crucial point about the evolution of AI technology : innovation often requires adapting to market needs and technical realities. While Pig.dev moved on, the pursuit of Windows automation is far from over. Microsoft itself is actively engaged in this space. In April, Microsoft announced the integration of computer use technology into Copilot Studio for graphical user interfaces like Windows, released as a research preview. Furthermore, Microsoft recently unveiled an agentic tool within Windows 11 designed to assist end-users in managing system settings. These developments indicate that major players recognize the importance of intelligent automation within desktop environments. Muscle Mem, Dunteman’s new venture, represents a complementary approach, focusing on the underlying efficiency of AI agents, which is critical for any form of successful automation, whether on a desktop or in the cloud. The ‘last mile’ of computer use, as Dunteman puts it, remains a compelling challenge that will continue to drive innovation in the AI sector. The story of Pig.dev is a powerful reminder of the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of startup innovation, especially in the cutting-edge field of AI. While their initial foray into Windows automation faced insurmountable market and technical challenges, the strategic pivot to Muscle Mem demonstrates resilience and a continued commitment to solving fundamental problems in AI agent efficiency. This evolution highlights that the path to truly autonomous and useful AI agents is multifaceted, requiring both direct automation solutions and foundational infrastructure improvements. As the AI landscape continues to mature, such pivots are not failures, but crucial steps in refining solutions that will ultimately shape our digital future.

Now in its eighth report, HTX’s Crypto Gem Hunt reinforces the platform’s philosophy of value investing, early discovery, and quality priority, curating a list of seven standout assets that combine market momentum with long-term narrative. This is not merely a hotlist of weekly top gainers. It’s a forward-looking curation of projects positioned to outperform over longer cycles. HTX New Listing Winners The Selected Seven Assets: From Meme Coins and GameFi to DeFi and L1 Narratives HTX’s Crypto Gem Hunt #8 features seven cherry-picked assets from several trending sectors with prosperous narratives. These sectors cover meme coins, GameFi, DeFi and RWA innovations, and public blockchain infrastructure. L1 Public Chain: Time-Honored Infrastructure, New Catalysts ● TRON ($TRX) | Rated S: TRON’s native token $TRX was recently adopted by Nasdaq-listed firm SRM as part of its strategic reserve, making TRON one of the first blockchain networks bridging into U.S. capital markets. This also makes TRON as a battle-tested Layer 1 network with a fresh off-chain narrative. While its price move of +16.7% is modest, its global exposure and off-chain integration signal a longer-term value growth. Meme Coins: Narrative Continues with Strong Community Backing ● BONK ($BONK): As one of Solana’s OG meme coins, $BONK is back in the spotlight, thanks to the Solana ecosystem revival. According to LetsBONK.fun, BONK has surpassed Pump.fun in on-chain activity, gaining a 193.2% surge over the period. ● MemeCore ($M): The top gainer, with a jaw-dropping +378.3% performance. Recently listed on both HTX and BN futures markets, its liquidity and social buzz continue to scale. ● Banana For Scale ($BANANAS31): A dark horse from the BNB Chain, up 347% since launch. Fueled by the light-hearted vibe and community energy, its memetic power still shows further viral marketing potential. ● Build On BNB ($BOBBSC): Another rising star of meme coin on BNB Smart Chain, $BOBBSC has surged over 200%, leveraging the BNB ecosystem’s benefits. It now plays at a low market cap, ideal for early value investment. GameFi: Legacy Tokens, New Momentum ● FUNToken ($FUN): A veteran in the GameFi space, now seeing renewed interest. With a robust tokenomics model and real in-game utility, $FUN has rebounded nearly by 94%, positioning itself as a strong recovery asset in the GameFi comeback story. DeFi + RWA: Real-World Asset Tokenization Heats Up ● Maple Finance ($SYRUP): The rising star of DeFi’s institutional pivot, specializing in on-chain credit and RWA lending. While Maple is tokenizing high-quality real-world assets with strong compliance narratives, $SYRUP has gained a 71.1% increase since its launch on HTX, driven by demand for yield-generating, regulation-friendly assets. Beyond the Charts: Why These Projects Matter These seven assets in HTX’s Crypto Gem Hunt #8 share a key trait: they are actively delivering on their narratives, not just promising them. From TRON’s growing real-world footprint to BONK’s strong rise on Solana, from the explosive virality of MemeCore and Build On BNB to the yield-driven momentum of Maple behind RWA’s building, these aren’t flash-in-the-pan plays. They’re structurally supported stories with runway left to go. HTX’s research team carefully tracks narrative fulfillment, not just speculation. This forward-focused methodology aims to help users identify long-term value, especially as retail sentiment continues to chase short-term price spikes. As the market heats up and narratives rotate at breakneck speed, the report stands as a reminder that the next bull cycle won’t be won by hype alone and the true gems may already be on-chain yet underexposed.

The crypto space is full of promises, but most coins never move beyond flashy headlines. Real-world tools, community activity, and growing demand often separate strong projects from weak ones. That’s why looking into the highest potential crypto options now can make a real difference. This list covers four projects: BlockDAG, SUI, SEI, and Jupiter, that stand out for their working features, rising adoption, and future plans. While all four bring something valuable, one of them is showing signs of being a major breakout in 2025. 1. BlockDAG: No Vesting Pass and 3,025% Launch ROI BlockDAG (BDAG) is quickly gaining attention as one of the highest potential crypto projects heading into 2025. The network already has a live testnet, mobile mining app, and tools like smart contracts and a block explorer. Over 2 million people have downloaded its app, and that number is still rising. The latest NO VESTING PASS offer gives early access buyers a clear benefit. For the next 8 days, all purchases come with 100% coin access at launch, no lockups. This is a huge shift from typical presales. The price is currently $0.0016 , while the confirmed launch price is $0.05. That means those buying now could see up to 3,025% profit. BlockDAG (BDAG) has already sold over 23.9 billion coins and raised more than $342 million. It’s also forming partnerships beyond the crypto space, including with Inter Milan and the Seattle Seawolves. With the full launch nearing, BlockDAG stands out for its working tech, open access, and big upside, making it a clear leader among the highest potential crypto picks. 2. SUI: User Activity Rises With Developer-Friendly Design SUI earns its place among the highest potential crypto picks thanks to its real-world focus. Built as a fast Layer-1 blockchain, SUI supports DeFi, NFTs, and gaming, all areas where speed matters. Developers like building on it, and users are starting to follow. A 145% surge in daily active users proves the network is picking up pace. SUI is also growing through new wallet activity and integrations, like the recent link with tBTC through Threshold Network. The coin is trading around $3.94, just 26% below its high of $5.35. If it stays above the $4 range, a move to $10 could happen during the next bull run. For those looking at the highest potential crypto options, SUI’s growth and speed make it worth watching from both tech and price angles. 3. SEI: Built for Speed and Trading Efficiency SEI is another project in the highest potential crypto group that’s built with purpose. As a Layer-1 chain focused on fast trading, it’s not trying to do everything. Instead, SEI is designed to deliver speed and scale for financial apps. In just 30 days, SEI jumped 105% in price, now sitting near $0.37. Its Total Value Locked crossed $682 million, reflecting growing network strength. The platform is moving past resistance points and attracting more interest, especially from users focused on DeFi tools. Analysts say SEI could break the $0.50 mark soon and possibly hit $1.14 by year-end. With rising usage and a focused mission, SEI continues to show why it’s among the highest potential crypto choices for 2025. 4. Jupiter: Driving Liquidity Across Solana DEXs Jupiter (JUP) is gaining steady ground as one of the highest potential crypto picks. As Solana’s main DEX aggregator, Jupiter routes around 80% of all decentralized trades on the network. It also gives users tools like limit orders and recurring buys, helping more people manage trades smoothly. Thanks to Solana’s rising use, driven by meme coin interest, Jupiter is also seeing increased traction. On-chain data reveals more users are holding JUP, a bullish sign for its future. The coin trades near $0.85, but past highs at $2.04 leave room for strong movement. Some expect a return to $5 if the market continues its upward trend. For a project offering real value through trading tools, Jupiter holds its place among 2025’s highest potential crypto picks. Wrapping It Up These four projects all stand out in different ways. SUI shows speed and network growth. SEI focuses on fast, on-chain trades. Jupiter supports Solana’s DeFi boom. But BlockDAG is shaping up to be the one with the widest reach. With over $342 million raised, 23.9 billion coins sold, a $0.0016 price now, and a NO VESTING PASS offer for 8 more days, its path to launch looks strong. Among the highest potential crypto picks of 2025, BlockDAG leads with real tools, access, and value.

The filing was submitted by Tom Farley, the firm’s CEO and former president of the NYSE. Tom now leads Bullish as it aims to scale beyond the private markets it’s been operating in. The IPO filing also revealed raw numbers. As of March 31, Bullish has processed over $1.25 trillion in total trading volume since launching. In the first quarter of 2025 alone, it reported $2.5 billion in average daily volume, which places it in the top five exchanges globally for spot Bitcoin and Ether trades. That’s based on internal data provided directly by the company. Bullish builds on big names, big volumes, and big politics The exchange started with cash from Founders Fund, Thiel Capital, Nomura, Mike Novogratz, and others. In 2023, Bullish bought crypto news outlet CoinDesk, adding media muscle to its platform. It now competes directly with Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken, as noted in the public prospectus. Tom didn’t comment directly in the filing, but the document did include a line from Bullish’s leadership that read: “In the first quarter of 2025, Bullish exchange executed over $2.5 billion in average daily volume, ranking in the top five exchanges by spot volume for Bitcoin and Ether.” This year has already seen multiple crypto companies try to grab a piece of the public market. Circle, the stablecoin issuer, went public in June and its valuation has climbed more than sevenfold since. In May, Etoro also debuted with a platform that allows users to trade crypto assets. Novogratz’s own company, Galaxy Digital, migrated its listing from Toronto to the Nasdaq. Meanwhile, Gemini, the exchange created by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, quietly filed for its own U.S. IPO last month. Bitcoin hasn’t been sitting still either. It’s currently trading above $117,000, a major jump from the $94,000 range it was hovering around at the start of 2025. Capital is still pouring into the sector, and that momentum is giving firms like Bullish more leverage when approaching public markets. On the regulatory side, President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law on the same day as Bullish’s IPO filing. The act introduces new stablecoin regulations to protect consumers. These digital tokens are supposed to be pegged to things like the U.S. dollar and are marketed as less volatile alternatives to regular crypto. Bullish’s SEC filing made its intentions clear: the company said it aims to “drive the adoption of stablecoins, crypto, and blockchain technology.” That wording wasn’t a throwaway. It’s directly tied to the bigger political forces backing this entire move. Thiel, Elon Musk, and David Sacks, who currently leads Trump’s AI and crypto strategy team, have all dumped massive funding into Trump’s reelection campaign. They’ve also pushed hard for laws that formally legitimize crypto exchanges and assets at the federal level. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Trading above all EMAs while RSI at healthy 64.37 suggests a technical reset amid institutional positioning uncertainty. A strong structural foundation emerges, with the price 16.9% above the 200-day EMA ( $97,723 ), while the MACD maintains bullish momentum despite a pullback from historic highs. The market cap stands at $2.34 trillion, with a daily volume of $82.25 billion, as Charles Schwab launches Bitcoin trading and Trump’s “Genius Act” opens a $9 trillion retirement market to crypto investments. The following analysis synthesizes ChatGPT’s 42 real-time technical indicators, retirement market developments, institutional adoption acceleration, and historic high implications to assess BTC’s 90-day trajectory amid a critical inflection point that determines whether the continuation or correction will occur. Technical Crossroads: Historic High Pullback Tests Bull Market Validity Bitcoin’s current price of $117,600 reflects a minor 1.32% daily decline from its historic all-time high of $123,091 , achieved on July 14th , marking a critical consolidation phase. The $3,505 intraday range represents 3.0% of the current price, demonstrating controlled volatility during institutional position adjustment periods. Source: TradingView RSI at 64.37 , a healthy level , provides optimal positioning with room for continued appreciation without overbought concerns, suggesting a technical reset rather than a trend reversal. This positioning suggests a sustainable bull market structure rather than an exhaustion spike, although decisive action above the $121K resistance remains crucial for validation. MACD indicators display strong bullish momentum, with a positive histogram at 2,836.92, confirming underlying strength despite a short-term pullback. Source: TradingView The combination of healthy RSI positioning and strong MACD signals creates an optimal setup for continuation toward $125K-$127K targets once consolidation completes. Retirement Market Revolution: Trump’s “Genius Act” Opens $9 Trillion Gateway President Trump’s planned signing of the “Genius Act” represents a revolutionary catalyst opening the $9 trillion US retirement market to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency investments. This development could trigger unprecedented institutional demand as 401(k) and pension funds gain regulatory approval for digital asset allocation. The retirement market integration addresses previous regulatory barriers that prevented institutional participation, creating sustainable demand drivers beyond speculative trading. Professional retirement fund managers, who are subject to fiduciary compliance, now have a regulatory framework for allocating Bitcoin to their treasuries. Charles Schwab’s launch of Bitcoin and Ethereum trading services validates the mainstream financial services’ embrace of cryptocurrency infrastructure. The $10 trillion asset manager’s entry provides credibility, attracting conservative institutional capital that was previously excluded from direct cryptocurrency exposure. Market Dominance Dynamics: Altcoin Season Speculation Builds Bitcoin’s market dominance, at 60.86% , shows a slight decline as altcoin season speculation intensifies following BTC’s historic high. This dominance shift creates a binary scenario in which Bitcoin either maintains its leadership or capital shifts toward altcoin alternatives. BTC dominance dropping “hard” according to analysts suggests a major utility season ahead as institutional capital explores high-performance blockchain alternatives. This rotation pattern has historically preceded significant altcoin appreciation cycles, while Bitcoin consolidates its gains. Historical Context: ATH Achievement Creates Psychological Inflection Bitcoin’s July 14th all-time high of $123,091 represents the culmination of institutional adoption momentum that had been building throughout 2021 . Current 4.36% discount to ATH provides attractive positioning while maintaining the psychological significance of historic breakthrough achievement. The 15% appreciation from June’s $108,799 close demonstrates sustained institutional demand despite broader market uncertainty. Historic high achievement creates a psychological inflection point where Bitcoin either validates a new valuation paradigm through continued appreciation or experiences a correction as early adopters secure profits. The next 30-60 days remain critical for determining the long-term trajectory. Support & Resistance: EMA Strength Provides Foundation Immediate support emerges at today’s low around $117,316 , reinforced by psychological support at $115,000-$116,000 . The exceptional EMA positioning, with prices 3-17% above all major moving averages, confirms the success of institutional accumulation and validates trend strength. Major support extends through the 20-day EMA at $113,968 and the 50-day EMA at $109,338 , providing multiple safety nets during any correction periods. This support structure appeals to institutional risk management, as it requires defined downside protection during historically high valuation levels. Critical resistance begins at today’s high around $120,821 , followed by psychological resistance at $121,000-$122,000 . Breaking above this zone would signal continuation toward major resistance at $125,000-$127,000, representing next institutional profit-taking and psychological milestone levels. Market Metrics: Institutional Validation Sustains Momentum Bitcoin maintains a historic $2.33 trillion market capitalization, accompanied by a robust 24-hour trading volume of $81.67 billion , which represents institutional validation of its store-of-value status at unprecedented levels. The 18.9% volume increase demonstrates continued professional participation despite pullback from highs. The circulating supply of 19.89 million BTC represents 94.7% of the maximum 21 million supply, creating increasing scarcity dynamics that appeal to institutional treasury allocation strategies. The approaching supply maximum intensifies deflationary arguments in favor of premium valuations. Current pricing is 4.36% below all-time highs, with extreme gains of 241,999,061% from 2010 lows, providing a compelling institutional narrative for continued appreciation. This risk-reward profile appeals to professional investors seeking exposure to a proven digital store of value with regulatory clarity. Social Sentiment: Community Division Reflects Market Uncertainty LunarCrush data reveals mixed community engagement with AltRank declining to 763 while maintaining 81% positive sentiment. The 130.79 million total engagements with 385.92K mentions demonstrate Bitcoin’s ability to capture attention during historic periods. A social dominance of 18.85% with declining creator participation suggests community uncertainty about the direction following a historic high achievement. Recent themes have focused on the potential for an altcoin season and validation of institutional adoption, rather than continued BTC appreciation. #Altcoin Season Index is Indicating the biggest and the final altcoin season of this cycle. pic.twitter.com/zv8PSsC1GG — Mags (@thescalpingpro) July 18, 2025 The sentiment division between 81% positive outlook and declining engagement metrics reflects broader market uncertainty about whether historic highs represent the continuation or culmination of current cycle dynamics. 90-Day BTC Price Forecast Institutional Momentum Continuation (Bull Case – 40% Probability) Successful retirement market integration and Charles Schwab adoption could drive continued appreciation toward $130,000-$140,000 , representing 11-19% upside. This scenario requires breaking above the $121K resistance and confirmation of sustained institutional positioning. Technical targets include $125K , $130K , and $140K based on psychological levels and institutional flow projections. The retirement market catalyst could attract massive conservative capital seeking digital store-of-value exposure with regulatory compliance. Historic High Consolidation (Base Case – 45% Probability) Extended consolidation between $115K and $125K could persist through Q3 2025, as institutional positioning develops and regulatory implementations advance. Support at the EMA cluster, around $109K-$114K, would likely remain stable during consolidation, with volume normalizing to approximately 60-70 billion daily. This sideways action provides institutional accumulation opportunities while preserving uptrend structure for eventual continuation. Correction from Historic Levels (Bear Case – 15% Probability) Breaking below EMA support at $114K could trigger a correction toward $100K-$105K , representing 11-15% downside. This scenario would require significant institutional demand disappointment or broader market weakness affecting digital asset adoption. The strong institutional adoption backdrop and regulatory clarity trends limit extreme downside scenarios, with major support at $100K-$105K providing a psychological foundation for future recovery cycles. BTC Forecast: Digital Gold Meets Institutional Infrastructure Bitcoin’s current positioning reflects the convergence of historic valuation achievements, institutional adoption acceleration, and regulatory integration advancements. The 42-signal analysis reveals that the cryptocurrency is positioned at a critical inflection point between the validation of a new paradigm and the consolidation requirements. Combined with historic high achievement and sustained institutional interest, these developments provide compelling continuation arguments. The $121K resistance breakthrough represents the definitive test of Bitcoin’s new valuation paradigm following historic ATH achievement. A successful breakout validates the institutional adoption thesis and triggers continuation toward $130K+ targets, while failure suggests a healthy consolidation phase before the next institutional catalyst wave.

Bitcoin Holder Rotation May Derail Rally According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor IT Tech, long-term Bitcoin holders (LTH) – those holding BTC for over 155 days – have transitioned into net distribution, suggesting seasoned investors are engaging in profit-taking. Meanwhile, short-term holders (STH) – those who have held BTC for less than 155 days — have recently turned net positive, indicating they are buying into BTC’s current rally in anticipation of further gains. Historical data shows that similar trends among LTH and STH were observed back in April 2021 and November 2023. During both these instances, BTC witnessed a cooling phase or a local top when spot demand faded. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Inflows Spike After $123,000 Peak – Signs Of Short-Term Cooling? In their analysis, IT Tech suggested keeping an eye on exchange inflows and funding rates for confirmation. If spot BTC inflows to crypto exchanges surge, it could hint that sell-pressure is likely to increase, which may derail the digital asset’s bullish trajectory. Supporting this view, CryptoQuant contributor Arab Chain noted that the Spent Output Value Ranges (SOVR) indicator shows a spike in BTC transfers to exchanges from wallets holding 1,000 to 10,000 BTC – typically associated with whales. For the uninitiated, the SOVR indicator tracks on-chain BTC transfers by value buckets to identify which investor segments are active. It helps reveal whether retail, mid-sized, or institutional players are driving market activity. This aligns with IT Tech’s observations on long-term holders. If selling pressure intensifies, BTC could correct down to a support level near $111,800. Not All Analysts See Rally Exhaustion Although Bitcoin LTH entering distribution phase, and whales increasing their deposits to crypto exchanges may point toward a potential end for the current rally, not all analysts share the same sentiment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Profit-Taking Spikes Without Price Drop – Strong Demand Or Delayed Reaction? For instance, the STH Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) suggests BTC may still be undervalued, indicating potential for further upside. If that holds, Bitcoin could climb as high as $150,000 before any major pullback. Additionally, a fresh injection of $2 billion in liquidity to major crypto derivatives platforms could help reignite bullish momentum. However, caution remains warranted. The Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross has been climbing steadily, giving early signs of an overheated market. At press time, BTC trades at $118,754, up 0.4% in the past 24 hours.

This isn’t just another corporate announcement; it marks a pivotal moment for Jack Dorsey’s Block , signaling its maturation and increasing influence within the dynamic fintech stock market . For investors and enthusiasts alike, this inclusion, effective before trading opens on July 23rd, as reported by Bitcoin Magazine on X, offers a fresh perspective on the company’s trajectory and its potential impact on the broader economy. It’s a testament to Block’s journey from a disruptive startup to a major player, and it naturally sparks questions about what this means for SQ stock analysis and the future of digital finance. What Does S&P 500 Inclusion Mean for Block S&P 500? The S&P 500 is more than just a list of companies; it’s widely considered the benchmark for large-cap U.S. equities, representing approximately 80% of the total market capitalization. For a company like Block to earn its place alongside corporate giants, it must meet stringent criteria, including market capitalization, liquidity, and sustained profitability. Block’s inclusion, replacing Hess Corp., is a powerful endorsement of its financial health and market standing. So, what are the tangible benefits of this prestigious entry for Block S&P 500 ? Increased Visibility and Prestige: Being part of the S&P 500 significantly elevates Block’s profile. It signals stability and reliability to a wider range of investors, both institutional and retail, who often look to the index as a barometer of market strength. Enhanced Liquidity: A substantial portion of investment funds, particularly passive index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), are designed to track the S&P 500. This means that as Block enters the index, these funds will automatically purchase its shares (SQ stock) to rebalance their portfolios, leading to a surge in demand and improved trading liquidity. Lower Cost of Capital: Increased investor confidence and liquidity can translate into a lower cost of capital for Block. This means the company might find it easier and cheaper to raise funds for future investments, expansions, or acquisitions, further fueling its growth. Broader Investor Base: Many institutional investors, pension funds, and wealth managers have mandates to invest only in S&P 500 companies. Block’s inclusion opens the door to this vast pool of capital, diversifying its shareholder base and potentially stabilizing its stock price over the long term. In essence, joining the S&P 500 is akin to receiving a gold star in the corporate world, confirming Block’s status as a robust, influential, and investment-worthy entity. The Visionary Behind the Move: Understanding Jack Dorsey’s Block At the heart of Block’s innovative trajectory is its co-founder and CEO, Jack Dorsey . Known globally for co-founding Twitter, Dorsey’s pivot towards Block (formerly Square) and his passionate advocacy for Bitcoin have defined the company’s unique path. His vision for a decentralized financial future, where individuals have greater control over their money, permeates Block’s various ventures. Block’s ecosystem is multifaceted, encompassing: Square: The foundational business, providing payment processing hardware and software for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). This includes point-of-sale systems, payroll services, and business loans, empowering countless entrepreneurs. Cash App: A hugely popular mobile payment service that allows users to send and receive money, invest in stocks, and even buy and sell Bitcoin. Cash App has become a significant driver of Block’s growth, especially among younger demographics. TBD: A platform focused on building decentralized financial services, particularly around Bitcoin. This aligns with Dorsey’s belief in Bitcoin as the internet’s native currency. Spiral (formerly Square Crypto): An independent team dedicated to advancing Bitcoin development through open-source projects. Dorsey’s steadfast commitment to Bitcoin, often expressing his belief that it will eventually unite the world, positions Jack Dorsey’s Block as a unique player in the financial sector. Unlike many traditional fintech companies, Block actively explores the intersection of conventional payments and the burgeoning world of cryptocurrency, striving to make digital assets more accessible and useful for everyday transactions. This forward-thinking approach has not only fueled its growth but also differentiated it in a crowded market. How Will SQ Stock React to This Landmark SQ Stock Analysis? For investors holding or considering SQ stock , the S&P 500 inclusion naturally raises questions about its immediate and long-term price performance. Historical data suggests that companies often experience a positive bump in their stock price both leading up to and immediately following S&P 500 inclusion. This “inclusion effect” is primarily driven by the mandatory buying from index funds. However, a thorough SQ stock analysis requires looking beyond the immediate surge. While the initial demand from index funds is a powerful catalyst, the long-term performance of Block’s stock will ultimately depend on its underlying fundamentals, strategic execution, and ability to navigate market challenges. Potential scenarios for SQ stock : Short-Term Volatility: While index funds buy, some existing investors might use the opportunity to take profits, leading to short-term price fluctuations. However, the net effect is typically positive. Increased Analyst Coverage: Greater visibility often leads to more analyst coverage, which can bring more scrutiny but also more informed investment decisions. Investor Confidence: The S&P 500 stamp of approval can boost overall investor confidence, potentially attracting a new class of long-term holders who value stability and proven performance. Investors should remember that while S&P 500 inclusion is a significant milestone, it is not a guarantee of perpetual stock appreciation. Block’s ability to innovate, expand its user base, manage regulatory risks, and execute its Bitcoin-centric strategy will be crucial for sustained growth. Reshaping the Fintech Stock Market: Block’s Broader Impact Block’s journey into the S&P 500 is not just about one company; it reflects broader trends reshaping the entire fintech stock market . The financial technology sector has been a hotbed of innovation, challenging traditional banking models and offering more accessible, efficient, and user-friendly financial services. Block stands at the forefront of this transformation. Block’s influence extends across several key areas: Democratizing Finance: Through products like Cash App and its Square ecosystem for SMBs, Block has made financial tools accessible to individuals and small businesses that might have been underserved by traditional banks. This democratization of finance is a hallmark of the fintech revolution. Bridging Crypto and Traditional Finance: Block’s unwavering commitment to Bitcoin, coupled with its mainstream payment services, positions it uniquely to bridge the gap between the nascent world of cryptocurrencies and conventional financial systems. This integration is crucial for wider crypto adoption. Competitive Landscape: Block’s success story puts pressure on both legacy financial institutions and other fintech players. Its agility, innovation, and focus on user experience set a high bar, driving competition and fostering further advancements across the sector. The inclusion of Block in the S&P 500 underscores the growing importance and maturity of the fintech sector within the broader economy. It signals that digital payment solutions, mobile banking, and even cryptocurrency-related services are no longer niche but integral components of modern finance. This could pave the way for more fintech companies to achieve similar recognition, further diversifying the S&P 500 and reflecting the changing economic landscape. Navigating the Future: What’s Next After S&P 500 Inclusion? While S&P 500 inclusion is a significant achievement, it also brings new responsibilities and challenges. As a larger, more visible public company, Block will face increased scrutiny from investors, analysts, and regulators. The journey doesn’t end here; it merely transitions into a new phase of growth and strategic development. What might the future hold for Block? Continued Innovation: To maintain its competitive edge, Block must continue to innovate across its product lines, from enhancing Cash App features to expanding its Square offerings and advancing its Bitcoin initiatives. Global Expansion: While Block has a strong presence in the U.S., there are vast untapped international markets where its solutions could thrive, offering new avenues for growth. Regulatory Navigation: The fintech and crypto spaces are subject to evolving regulatory frameworks. Block will need to skillfully navigate these changes to ensure compliance while pursuing its vision for decentralized finance. Balancing Growth and Profitability: As a mature public company, Block will face increasing pressure to balance aggressive growth strategies with sustainable profitability, a common challenge for high-growth tech firms. Jack Dorsey’s Long-Term Vision: Dorsey’s long-term commitment to Bitcoin and decentralization suggests that Block will continue to push the boundaries of financial technology, potentially venturing into new areas like decentralized identity or web5 applications. The S&P 500 inclusion marks Block’s arrival as a financial titan, but its future success will depend on its ability to execute on these strategic imperatives, maintain its innovative spirit, and adapt to an ever-changing financial landscape. Conclusion: A New Era for Block and Beyond Block’s highly anticipated entry into the S&P 500 is far more than just a procedural update to an index; it is a profound declaration of the company’s success, resilience, and pivotal role in shaping the future of finance. For Jack Dorsey’s Block , it represents the culmination of years of innovation, strategic growth, and a steadfast commitment to empowering individuals and businesses through accessible financial tools. This milestone not only validates Block’s business model but also highlights the increasing mainstream acceptance of fintech and digital payments within the traditional stock market . As SQ stock gains unprecedented visibility and institutional backing, its journey will undoubtedly serve as a crucial barometer for the evolving landscape where conventional finance intersects with the revolutionary potential of cryptocurrency. It marks a new era for Block, solidifying its position as a leading force in the global financial technology arena and paving the way for further transformative developments.

It’s a stamp of approval from the broader financial community. 2. When will Block officially join the S&P 500? Block is set to join the S&P 500 before trading opens on July 23rd, replacing Hess Corp. 3. How does S&P 500 inclusion typically affect a company’s stock? Historically, companies entering the S&P 500 often experience a positive surge in their stock price due to increased demand from index funds that must purchase shares to track the index. This “inclusion effect” can provide a short-term boost, but long-term performance depends on the company’s fundamental business strength and future growth prospects. 4. What are Block’s primary business segments? Block operates primarily through two main segments: the Square ecosystem, which provides payment processing and business tools for small and medium-sized businesses, and Cash App, a popular mobile payment service for individuals that also offers investing in stocks and Bitcoin. Block also has ventures like TBD and Spiral focused on Bitcoin and decentralized technologies. 5. What is Jack Dorsey’s stance on cryptocurrency, particularly Bitcoin?

Does S&P 500 inclusion guarantee Block’s continued success? While S&P 500 inclusion is a significant validation, it does not guarantee future success. It signifies past performance and current market standing. Block’s continued growth and profitability will depend on its ability to innovate, expand its services, manage regulatory challenges, and adapt to the evolving fintech and cryptocurrency landscapes.

What makes this announcement particularly noteworthy for the cryptocurrency world is the company’s explicit intention to allocate the majority of these funds towards a strategic Bitcoin acquisition . This bold decision, reported by BWEnews on X, places Aether Holdings squarely in the spotlight as a Nasdaq-listed entity embracing digital assets as a core component of its treasury strategy. Unpacking Aether Holdings’ Investment Strategy Aether Holdings, with a current market capitalization of $160.46 million, is making a clear statement about its long-term vision. The $40 million offering is not just about raising capital; it’s about strategically deploying it into an asset class that many traditional financial institutions are still hesitant to fully embrace. This commitment to a substantial Bitcoin acquisition reflects a growing confidence in the digital currency’s role as a store of value and a potential hedge against inflation. For a company operating in the financial technology sector, this move could be seen as both a natural progression and a pioneering step. It aligns with the ethos of innovation that fintech companies often embody, while also setting a precedent for how public companies might manage their reserves in an increasingly digital economy. The decision to prioritize Bitcoin in their treasury management speaks volumes about their outlook on future economic conditions and the potential for digital assets to outperform traditional investments. Why Bitcoin Now? The Rise of Corporate Bitcoin Strategy Aether Holdings is not operating in a vacuum. Its decision to adopt a corporate Bitcoin strategy is part of a broader trend that has seen several high-profile companies integrate Bitcoin into their balance sheets. Pioneers like MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, have aggressively accumulated Bitcoin, advocating for its superiority as a treasury reserve asset over fiat currencies susceptible to inflation. So, why are more companies, including Nasdaq-listed ones, turning to Bitcoin? Several factors are at play: Inflation Hedge: With global quantitative easing and rising inflation concerns, companies are seeking assets that can preserve or even grow purchasing power. Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it an attractive alternative to depreciating fiat currencies. Store of Value: Often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ Bitcoin’s scarcity and decentralized nature make it a compelling long-term store of value, attracting corporations looking to diversify their treasury holdings beyond traditional cash and bonds. Growth Potential: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has demonstrated significant long-term growth potential, offering companies an opportunity for substantial returns on their treasury investments. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset like Bitcoin can help diversify a company’s treasury, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. This evolving perspective highlights a fundamental shift in how corporate treasurers view their responsibilities, moving beyond mere liquidity management to active capital appreciation through strategic digital asset allocation. The Broader Trend: Accelerating Institutional Crypto Adoption Aether Holdings’ move is a powerful indicator of accelerating institutional crypto adoption . While retail investors have driven much of Bitcoin’s early growth, the entry of publicly traded companies, asset managers, and financial institutions lends significant legitimacy and stability to the cryptocurrency market. This wave of institutional interest is characterized by: Increased Regulatory Clarity: As regulators worldwide begin to establish clearer frameworks for digital assets, institutions feel more comfortable entering the space. Improved Infrastructure: The development of secure custody solutions, regulated exchanges, and institutional-grade trading platforms has made it easier and safer for large entities to acquire and manage digital assets. Growing Investor Demand: Shareholders and clients are increasingly looking for exposure to digital assets, pressuring companies and funds to incorporate them into their offerings or treasury strategies. The commitment from companies like Aether Holdings signals a maturation of the crypto market, transforming it from a niche investment into a recognized asset class within mainstream finance. Benefits and Risks of a Digital Asset Treasury Embracing a digital asset treasury strategy, particularly one centered on Bitcoin, comes with a unique set of benefits and challenges that companies must carefully weigh. Potential Benefits: Asset Appreciation: The most evident benefit is the potential for significant capital gains if Bitcoin’s value continues to climb. Innovation Leadership: Positioning the company as forward-thinking and innovative, which can attract talent and investors interested in cutting-edge financial strategies. Hedge Against Macroeconomic Instability: Offering a potential shield against currency devaluation and traditional market downturns. Enhanced Investor Appeal: Attracting a new segment of investors who are bullish on digital assets and appreciate a company’s progressive treasury management. Key Challenges and Risks: Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can experience dramatic swings, which could impact a company’s balance sheet and reported earnings. Regulatory Uncertainty: Despite progress, the regulatory landscape for digital assets remains fluid and varies by jurisdiction, posing compliance challenges. Custody and Security: Securely holding large amounts of Bitcoin requires specialized expertise and robust security protocols to prevent hacks or loss. Accounting and Tax Implications: The accounting treatment for digital assets can be complex and may vary, requiring careful consideration and expert advice. Aether Holdings’ decision implies they have carefully considered these factors and are prepared to navigate the complexities for the potential upside. What Does This Mean for Aether Holdings Investment and the Market? The news of a significant Aether Holdings investment in Bitcoin is likely to have several ripple effects. For Aether Holdings itself, it could: Boost Investor Confidence: Particularly among those who believe in the long-term value of Bitcoin and appreciate companies that are early adopters of new financial paradigms. Influence Stock Performance: The company’s stock (AETR on Nasdaq) might see increased volatility, potentially attracting both bullish crypto investors and cautious traditional investors. Strengthen Brand Image: Solidify its reputation as an innovative fintech leader, comfortable with emerging technologies and financial instruments. For the broader market, Aether Holdings’ move adds another data point to the growing narrative of institutional adoption. Each new public company that adds Bitcoin to its treasury reinforces the asset’s legitimacy and contributes to its increasing mainstream acceptance. It could encourage other mid-cap companies to explore similar strategies, further driving demand and potentially impacting Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Looking Ahead: The Future of Corporate Crypto Holdings Aether Holdings’ strategic Bitcoin acquisition is more than just a single transaction; it’s a testament to a shifting paradigm in corporate finance. As the digital economy continues to expand, the concept of a “treasury” is broadening to include digital assets as a legitimate and potentially high-performing component. We may see a future where: More companies, irrespective of their industry, allocate a portion of their reserves to digital assets. Specialized financial products and services emerge to cater specifically to corporate digital asset treasury management. Regulatory frameworks become even more sophisticated, providing clearer guidelines for accounting, taxation, and custody of these assets. The journey of corporate Bitcoin adoption is still in its early stages, but moves like Aether Holdings’ signal a significant acceleration. It’s a compelling example of how companies are adapting their financial strategies to a rapidly changing global economic landscape, where digital assets are no longer just an alternative but a strategic imperative. Aether Holdings’ bold $40 million offering, primarily earmarked for a substantial Bitcoin acquisition , marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing narrative of corporate embrace of digital assets. This strategic decision by the Nasdaq-listed financial technology platform highlights a growing trend among forward-thinking companies to integrate Bitcoin into their treasury strategies, signaling confidence in its long-term value and its potential as a hedge against economic uncertainties. It underscores the accelerating pace of institutional crypto adoption, pushing digital assets further into the mainstream financial consciousness. While challenges like volatility and regulatory nuances remain, the benefits of asset appreciation, innovation leadership, and enhanced investor appeal are clearly compelling for Aether Holdings. This move not only solidifies Aether Holdings’ position as an innovator but also contributes to the broader legitimization of Bitcoin, potentially inspiring other companies to explore the strategic advantages of a diversified digital asset treasury . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is Aether Holdings’ primary reason for acquiring Bitcoin? Aether Holdings intends to allocate the majority of its $40 million offering towards Bitcoin acquisitions as part of its treasury strategy. This move is driven by a belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value as a store of value, a hedge against inflation, and its potential for significant capital appreciation, aligning with a broader trend of corporate digital asset adoption. 2. How does Aether Holdings’ move compare to other companies’ Bitcoin strategies? Aether Holdings joins a growing list of public companies, including pioneers like MicroStrategy and Tesla, that have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets.

This signifies a continued trend of institutional crypto adoption. 3. What are the potential risks associated with Aether Holdings’ Bitcoin acquisition? Key risks include Bitcoin’s inherent price volatility, which could impact the company’s financial statements. Regulatory uncertainty in the digital asset space, as well as the complexities of secure custody and accounting for cryptocurrencies, also present challenges that Aether Holdings will need to manage. 4. How might this investment impact Aether Holdings’ stock? Aether Holdings’ stock (AETR on Nasdaq) could experience increased investor interest, particularly from those bullish on cryptocurrencies. It may lead to higher trading volumes and potential price appreciation if the market views this as a strategic, forward-thinking move. However, it could also introduce new volatility linked to Bitcoin’s price fluctuations. 5. What is a ‘digital asset treasury’?

Greptile, an AI code review startup, is making waves with a potential Series A funding round that could redefine its trajectory and the broader AI landscape. This news, while not directly about crypto, highlights the massive capital flows into AI, a sector increasingly intertwined with the infrastructure and tools powering the decentralized future. Greptile Funding: A New Era for AI Code Review? Sources close to the deal indicate that Greptile, the innovative AI-powered code review startup, is on the cusp of securing a substantial Series A funding round. This pivotal investment is reportedly set at $30 million, propelling the company’s valuation to an astonishing $180 million. The round is expected to be led by Benchmark partner Eric Vishria, a notable name in the venture capital world. While the final terms are still fluid and the deal has not officially closed, the sheer scale of this potential Greptile funding round signals strong investor confidence in the nascent but rapidly growing AI code review sector. Benchmark Ventures’ Bold Bet: Why Greptile Stands Out The potential leadership of Benchmark Ventures in Greptile’s Series A speaks volumes about the startup’s promise. Benchmark is renowned for its early investments in groundbreaking tech companies, and their interest in Greptile underscores the unique value proposition the company brings to the table. Founded by Daksh Gupta shortly after his graduation from Georgia Tech in 2023, Greptile quickly gained traction, going through the prestigious Y Combinator Winter 2024 cohort and subsequently raising a $4 million seed round led by Initialized Capital. Gupta’s vision for Greptile is to create a bot that acts as an experienced coworker, deeply understanding a customer’s code to pinpoint bugs and issues human reviewers might miss. Navigating the Competitive Landscape of AI Startups The realm of AI startups , particularly in specialized areas like code review, is intensely competitive. Greptile operates in a crowded field, facing off against well-funded rivals. For instance, Graphite, another prominent player, recently closed a $52 million Series B round, drawing investment from Accel, Anthropic’s Anthology Fund, Menlo Ventures, and a16z. Coderabbit, a key competitor, also secured a significant $16 million Series A last year from CRV. This fierce competition is a driving force behind the demanding work culture at Greptile, as highlighted by its founder. Unpacking Greptile’s Series A Valuation: What It Means for the Market The proposed $180 million Series A valuation for Greptile, if finalized, represents a significant milestone for a startup so early in its journey. This valuation reflects not only the potential of Greptile’s technology but also the broader market’s appetite for sophisticated AI tools that enhance developer productivity. It suggests that investors are betting on AI-driven code review becoming an indispensable part of the software development lifecycle, capable of pinpointing bugs and potential issues with a depth of understanding that human reviewers might miss. Attracting an A-list VC like Benchmark at such a healthy valuation could prove invaluable in Greptile’s challenging journey. The Work-Life Balance Debate: A Glimpse into Startup Culture Perhaps one of the most talked-about aspects of Greptile’s early journey has been its demanding work culture. Founder Daksh Gupta’s candid post on X (formerly Twitter) in November, stating that Greptile ‘offers no work-life-balance,’ went viral. He elaborated that employees typically work from 9 am to 11 pm, including Saturdays, and sometimes Sundays. Gupta later clarified to various news outlets that such intense effort is deemed necessary to outcompete rivals in a winner-take-all market. His philosophy, ‘No one cares about the third-best company, or even the second-best company in any category in software. If you’re going to put in 95 percent effort, it’s the equivalent of putting in 0 percent effort,’ reflects a mindset common in high-growth, competitive startup environments, particularly within the fast-paced AI sector. While controversial, this commitment to maximum effort is presented as a direct response to the cutthroat nature of the AI industry. Greptile’s journey, from its Y Combinator origins to its potential landmark Series A funding led by Benchmark, encapsulates the dynamic and often intense world of AI startups. While the demanding work culture sparks debate, the significant valuation and high-profile investor interest underscore the immense potential seen in AI-powered code review. As AI continues to integrate deeper into every facet of technology, companies like Greptile are at the forefront, striving to revolutionize how software is built and maintained. The coming months will reveal if this bold investment pays off, solidifying Greptile’s position as a leader in the competitive AI landscape.

48502896,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=768986,1752882827,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/48502896.jpeg,Treasury Chief hails GENIUS Act as milestone in digital currency race,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/genius-act-as-milestone-in-crypto-race/,"Treasury Secretary Bessent has hailed signing the GENIUS Act as a “milestone achievement” for cryptocurrency regulation, marking what many see as a historic moment for the digital asset industry. The legislation, passed with bipartisan support in the US House, establishes a clear federal framework for digital assets, addressing key areas such as stablecoins, custody, and market structure. Ian De Bode, chief strategy officer at Ondo Finance, said the bill opens the door for companies like his to expand operations nationwide, calling it “the start of a new regulatory era.” Speaking with news outlets, he said clear regulations are essential for major financial institutions to participate in digital asset infrastructure. He explained that the lack of legal clarity was the biggest barrier and added that clearer rules would lead to faster adoption. He also noted the involvement of Patrick McHenry, former Chair of the House Financial Services Committee and now Vice Chair at Ondo Finance. McHenry was with former President Donald Trump when the bill was signed. GENIUS Act sparks market optimism Crypto markets rallied on news of the GENIUS Act’s passage, and major digital currencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) gained momentum. This is no coincidence, industry leaders say. Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad, Deputy CEO of Bitpanda, said the move shapes investor sentiment in the crypto space. He noted that the milestone drives broad market optimism, attributing the recent Bitcoin rally and growing interest in altcoins like XRP and DOGE to increased regulatory clarity. He added that investors need certainty to commit for the long term, and that certainty comes from clear, enforceable rules. Apart from these fluctuations, the bill could change how investment firms and hedge funds deploy capital. Obtaining prescribed rules will make it easier for institutions to manage risks when categorising types of crypto assets, trading platforms, and consumer safety. Tae Oh, CEO of Gluwa, focused on the bill’s impact on stablecoins. He said the GENIUS Act marks a major first step in establishing a federal framework for USD-pegged stablecoins. He described it as a strong endorsement of responsible innovation, consumer protection, and the potential for a competitive and dynamic global stablecoin industry. He explained that the bill forms the groundwork for adopting digital assets into the broader financial infrastructure, particularly payments, decentralized finance (DeFi), and cross-border transactions. He said that when the fog clears on regulations, trust in stablecoins is a legitimate tool for everyday finance. Oh, also underscored the significance of the pending Federal Reserve policy meeting, adding that it would only take a hint of a policy pivot to have a big impact on risk asset classes, including crypto. US aligns with global crypto regulation trend The GENIUS Act and other similar efforts have been part of a global effort to create boundaries around the digital asset space. Analysts say the United States is starting to move in line with regulatory efforts in other large economies. The EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), which is being transposed into law across all Member States, provides a continental point of reference. Offering a single market for the issuance, trading, and storing of crypto assets, MiCA already has companies lining up for a regulatory jurisdiction in Europe. Similar measures are being developed in Singapore, South Korea, and Japan, whose digital asset guidelines will adapt to the fast-paced digital innovation. These developments, seen in combination, suggest that policymakers worldwide are increasingly of one mind: the crypto industry needs to be regulated, but not at the cost of hampering innovation. However, global strategies vary. Some, especially in the Global South, emphasize the redesign of financial infrastructure, while others, as with the US SEC, persist in enforcement using securities laws.

Bullish, a prominent crypto exchange with significant backing, has officially filed for an Initial Public Offering (IPO) in the United States. This move marks a pivotal moment for the burgeoning cryptocurrency sector, signaling growing maturity and a desire for broader mainstream financial integration. What does this bold step mean for the future of digital asset trading and the broader cryptocurrency market ? What is the Significance of Bullish’s SEC Filing? On July 18, Bullish, the crypto exchange that boasts the formidable backing of PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, submitted its SEC filing for an Initial Public Offering with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The company intends to list its shares under the ticker symbol “BLSH.” This formal submission follows earlier reports last month, which indicated that Bullish had already made a confidential filing, setting the stage for this public announcement. For context, an IPO is a process where a private company offers its shares to the public for the first time. It’s a significant milestone that provides capital for growth and often increases a company’s visibility and credibility. For Bullish, and indeed for the entire cryptocurrency market , this Bullish IPO represents more than just a fundraising event; it’s a statement of intent regarding the long-term viability and legitimacy of digital assets within traditional financial frameworks. Institutional Focus: Bullish has positioned itself as an exchange primarily targeting institutional investors, offering high-performance trading and deep liquidity. This focus differentiates it from many retail-centric exchanges. High-Profile Backing: The involvement of figures like Peter Thiel, known for his early investments in Facebook and Palantir, lends significant credibility and strategic insight to Bullish. Regulatory Engagement: By pursuing an IPO in the U.S., Bullish is embracing the regulatory scrutiny that comes with public listings, potentially setting a precedent for other crypto firms. How Does Peter Thiel’s Involvement Boost the Bullish IPO? The name Peter Thiel carries immense weight in the technology and finance sectors. As a co-founder of PayPal and an early investor in revolutionary companies like Facebook, his endorsement of Bullish is not merely a financial investment; it’s a powerful vote of confidence. Thiel’s involvement signals to both traditional investors and the crypto community that Bullish is a serious player with ambitious long-term goals. Thiel’s venture capital firm, Founders Fund, has a history of backing disruptive technologies. His association with Bullish suggests that he sees significant potential for the exchange to bridge the gap between conventional finance and the digital asset world. This high-profile backing could: Attract More Institutional Capital: Traditional financial institutions, often wary of the volatile crypto space, might view Bullish more favorably due to Thiel’s reputation. Enhance Credibility: The “Thiel effect” can elevate Bullish’s standing, making it more appealing to a broader range of investors, from seasoned Wall Street veterans to retail participants looking for stable crypto exposure. Influence Strategic Direction: Thiel’s experience in scaling tech companies could provide invaluable guidance as Bullish navigates the complexities of a public listing and rapid expansion in the competitive crypto exchange landscape. What are the Broader Implications for the Cryptocurrency Market? The Bullish IPO is more than an isolated event; it’s a barometer for the evolving relationship between digital assets and mainstream finance. As more cryptocurrency-native companies seek public listings, it signifies a maturation of the sector and an increasing desire for transparency and regulatory compliance. This trend could have several far-reaching effects on the entire cryptocurrency market : Increased Mainstream Acceptance: A successful IPO by a major crypto exchange like Bullish could pave the way for greater institutional adoption and public trust in digital assets. It moves crypto from the fringes to the core of financial discussions. Regulatory Clarity (or Pressure): While the SEC filing process is rigorous, it forces companies to adhere to established financial reporting and governance standards. This could either pressure regulators to provide clearer guidelines for the crypto industry or lead to more stringent oversight. Benchmarking for Valuations: Public listings provide a clearer valuation metric for crypto companies, offering insights into how traditional markets assess the potential of digital asset businesses. This could influence future private funding rounds and M&A activities. Enhanced Investor Access: For retail investors, participating in a crypto exchange IPO offers a way to gain exposure to the underlying infrastructure of the crypto market without directly holding volatile cryptocurrencies. What Challenges and Opportunities Lie Ahead for Bullish? While the prospect of a Bullish IPO is exciting, the journey to becoming a publicly traded company in the U.S. is fraught with challenges, especially for a company operating in the still-nascent cryptocurrency market . However, it also presents significant opportunities: Challenges: Regulatory Scrutiny: The SEC has been increasingly vigilant regarding crypto-related activities. Bullish will face intense scrutiny over its operations, token listings, and compliance measures. Market Volatility: The performance of a crypto exchange is inherently tied to the volatility and sentiment of the broader cryptocurrency market. Significant downturns could impact its revenue and stock performance. Competition: The crypto exchange landscape is highly competitive, with established players and new entrants constantly vying for market share. Bullish must maintain its competitive edge. Opportunities: Capital for Growth: An IPO provides substantial capital that Bullish can use for technological development, expansion into new markets, and strategic acquisitions. Enhanced Brand Reputation: Being a publicly traded company can significantly boost Bullish’s brand image, making it more attractive to both users and top talent. Liquidity for Early Investors: The IPO offers an exit strategy for early investors and employees, providing liquidity for their holdings. The path for Bullish will be closely watched, as its success or struggles could influence other major players in the crypto exchange space contemplating similar moves. In conclusion, Bullish’s decision to pursue a U.S. IPO is a landmark event for the digital asset industry. Backed by visionary investors like Peter Thiel , this SEC filing signals a growing confidence in the long-term viability of cryptocurrencies and the infrastructure that supports them. While challenges related to regulation and market volatility persist, the opportunities for growth, institutional adoption, and mainstream integration are immense. The Bullish IPO is poised to be a significant chapter in the ongoing narrative of the cryptocurrency market ’s journey into the global financial mainstream.

We worked hard. Thank you very much. Yeah, we worked hard. It's a very important act, the GENIUS act. They named it after me. And I want to thank want to thank you. This is a hell of an act. You know, I did something very unusual. I said, this has been something it's been a lot of people thought it was impossible, some of the things that have been done. Then, of course, the great big beautiful idea, the word great, the great big beautiful bill, that was something that nobody thought possible. They thought it would be in anywhere from seven to maybe three. I'll go the opposite direction, but three to seven different bills. And we said, Let's just put it in one, because this way there's something for everyone. And there really is, is a lot of things for everyone. And when we get the word out how great that is for every single person in this country, virtually, and the all they have is a sound bite death. You know their sound bite is death. Aren't they nice that they are the most incompetent people. They've lost their confidence. They've lost everything, if you think about it, but Jasmine Crockett is on her way. She's on her way. That's She's the new star of the Democrat Party, Jasmine Crockett, they're in big trouble. But I have to tell you, that was great, and this was great, and I am so tired of making phone calls at 234, o'clock in the morning, getting calls from our great speaker, sir, we have 12 hard nos. I say, Mike, Mike, it's two o'clock in the morning. We have 12 hard Nos. The good news is I call up. Hello Jim. How are you, sir? You have my vote, Sir, you have my vote. I really just, they just want a little love. Unfortunately, it's always the same. It's always the same 12 people. That's, it's, it's five senators, and it's 12. And I actually said to John Thune, and I said to Mike, I said, Listen, I want to have a party, but not to those people that I have to speak to endlessly every time. And they're wonderful because they always seem to come through, other than a couple, Rand Paul Jr from Congress, and Rand Paul other than a few people. But I said, I want to have them over. We're going to have a party for everybody in Congress, everyone Congress, except 12. We're going to have and Mike is de I'll tell you what. Tom has definitely covered the whole group. Where are those 12 people? They're the only people I don't see. We could do it today. We don't have to vote. And I would say, of the 53 senators, 48 with a 48 in half, you won't even have to come to that one. But these are the greatest people, because they always vote yes, and we don't have to go crazy. You trust us. We trust you. That has been a very special group of people. We really do. I mean, 96% phenomenal. And 4% extremely difficult. Do you agree with that? But they get there, most of them, not all of them. Those are the ones we really don't like. But I want to thank you all for being here. This is really a big day. This afternoon, we take a giant step to cement American dominance of global finance and crypto technology as we signed the landmark genius Act into law. So congratulations to everybody.

Looks great. He's got the whole package. But, you know, I got to know him. He was ambassador to Japan, and we had a little problem with Japan on trade, but he was my ambassador to Japan, and I went to Japan, and he is speaking fluently Japanese. I said, Did you learn it as a child? No, no, I just learned it over the last four or five months. I said, you learn Japanese? Maybe the single hardest language to learn, it's actually breathing, rather than it's breathing. I'm not going to imitate it, because we'll end up with a big story, and I don't want that. But he spoke totally fluent Japanese. I said, That's very impressive. And he was introducing me to Mr. Honda. I said, Oh, are you in the car business? He goes, yes. I said, You're a very rich man. And then he said, Mr. Toyota. Right, Toyota. Then I said, What business are you in? Let me guess. He said, cars. He was my interpreter, and I was so impressed. And I was getting ready to leave. He said, Sir, I'd like to run for the United States Senate. I said, Where are you from? He said, Tennessee. I said, Well, I love Tennessee, but do they know you there? No, but if you endorse me, I'll win, right? And I endorse him, and he took a 48 point lead, and they didn't know who the hell he was, and he's turned out to be a great senator, and now they all know who you are. So you are, you're fantastic, and we thank you, and you just the fact that you're doing this, and you understand this is a complicated world, and you understand it, Bill, so you've been great. Thank you very much. We're also pleased to be joined by our great Vice President, J de Vance. JD, thank you very much. Good job. And he's been up speaking late at night on the phone, I said. JD, how about you take it three or four of these people, please, because three or four I cannot speak to. I just can't and he take them, and he'd come through, right? JD, also speaker Mike Johnson, he is unbelievable. He's an unbelievable I mean, if you go by what we're doing, if you keep at this pace, you can't keep it up for another 200 days. But I will tell you this, if you keep up this pace for another week, you go down as the greatest speaker in the house in history. So one more word. Who needs Tip O'Neill? Who needs Tip O'Neill? He's better looking than Tip O'Neill too. But no, he's been going. He's been going at a fervent pace. Would you say that's right? Your wife probably says You are crazy. You've been aging beautifully in front. He's an amazing actually, he's an amazing speaker, a great leader, and everybody likes him and respects him, and that's why we're with a very small majority, like three. We had a time when we were one. Remember, we said we're one heart attack away from losing the house, and we won a couple of seats and a couple of other now we have seven, maybe, maybe, if we're lucky, seven, but we win with nobody's ever done I don't think anyone's ever done this before to win with those of all, we had a little help from John too, right? And a lot of other people I want to introduce, also Secretary Howard lucknick, who's been fantastic. You have done a great job, Howard, we've got great deals coming out of our ears. We have so many trade deals. And I really mean this too. It's like, how do you deal with so many but you know, I always say, well, we send out the papers that was a deal. They don't want to the fake news doesn't want to hear that. When I send out the paper that you're paying 35 or 40% tariff, that's a deal. Then they'll call and see if they can make a little bit different kind of a deal, like opening up their country to trade. In some cases, they've never been open. But we're doing well, and we have a couple of big ones to announce pretty soon, right? Could almost do it today. Maybe we'll say it. Maybe later on, we'll do it. Senator Bernie Moreno, what a great victory? Bernie had a great victory. Great Victory. That was one of the truly tough races. A lot of people weren't sure anybody could win that scene, and you won it in easy fashion, right? We want it together when you think of it, but you want it in easy fashion. Did a great job. Great guy, House Majority Whip. This is a great leader, Tom Emmer, a great politician and leader, really good. And I like his wife, even better, his wife is, she's the boss, but she's, she's, you are married to a fantastic woman. And he knows that, and he likes, he likes hearing it, because some people don't, you know. They say, Sir, could you please stop saying that my wife is better than me, sir, because the guys that don't usually end up with a good marriage, you know, he's got a great marriage. So thank you Tom. You really are a fantastic leader and representative and representatives Troy downing French Hill. Where's French Hill? Where is French you have been so great. Thank you, Coach. I spoke to him a little late when he was walking down the hall of st French he said, I'm there, sir. You a great, great, great guy. Everyone respects you French. You know that? Bill heisinger, Bill, thank you very much. Thank you very much. Good job. Dan muser, I thought he was going to become the next Governor of Pennsylvania, but he likes Congress better, I guess so. But I think you're terrific. And you know, I would have always been behind you that I can tell you. Tim Moore, Tim, thank you. Tim. John, Rose, John, hi. John, thanks. Good job. Brian style, Brian style, still young, still nice and young, it's good. GT, Thompson. GT, thank you. Andy Barr, good friend of all of ours. Thank you, Andy. Monica de la Cruz, Monica, she's here someplace. Thank you, Monica. Thank you. Monica. Mike herodopoulos, Mike, thank you, Mike, look good. Mike Lawler, Mr. Salt, well, it should guarantee your district. I mean, you worked hard for New York, right? And you're on television. I'm on television. So this should be good for a couple of points, but without you and your couple of friends from New York, that wouldn't have happened. That was not easy, right? Congratulations. Great job. Anna, Paulina, Luna, Anna, who is so great, I don't even if she's here or not here, I want to tell you that she has been so great and worked so hard to make sure we got it approved. Ralph Norman, Ralph, Ralph, what happened to Ralph? Nick? Begich, Nick, thank you, Nick, good job. Good job. Good, good votes. I just saw a great poll on you. Huh? Very good congratulations. Like Andy ogles. Andy, terrific friend. Beth Van Dyne. Beth, thank you. Beth, great job. Thank you. Thank you very much for the great support. Roger Williams, a great baseball player who also had to take a bullet, unfortunately, but he is a great guy. He was involved in that whole catastrophe, but he's fantastic, and has been from day one, along with a lot of other people that I won't call out because I have no idea where the hell you are. I think I saw Jason here somewhere. Where's Jason? Oh, it's lucky I called him. Ooh, it's lucky. They didn't put your name because I invited you at the last moment, right? He was over there doing some business in the White House, but you've been incredible in your position. Nobody knows more about taxes and finance than you do, so we appreciate it, right? Is that true? Howard, it's true. Thanks, Jason, great job, and you'll help out with that other matter. You make him so strong and powerful, right? Along with Deputy Secretary of Treasury, Michael Fauci de Where is Michael Good? Michael, how are you good? You'll help out over there. Okay, and Ambassador Ken. Howie. Ambassador, thank you, Ken, great job, Ken. I also want to recognize some of the countless industry leaders here today, including Brian Armstrong of Coinbase, you've done a good job, Brian, that's a big deal. Dave Ripley of Kraken, Jeremy Allaire of circle, it was a big day. Good job. Good job. Jeremy. Paolo ardino of tether, hello Paulo. Thank you. Paolo. Ryan McInerney of visa, that's a good company. Thank you. Chris Pavlov, Rumble, Chris, Chris, what happened to your location? Chris, you're always a front row guy. You're just being nice today. I think How's rumble doing good? Good. If Rumble is doing good, that means truth is doing good. Truth, that's great. You're doing a great job. Thank you. Chris, very much. Vlad Tenev of Robinhood. Vlad, thank you, Brad, thank you. Vlad, good Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, these are two smart, handsome guys. They got the whole package. They're of Gemini, but they have the whole pack. They have a lot of things, actually, but Gemini is just the one for today, right? They've got the all, they've got the look. They've got the the genius. Got plenty of cash. And it's great that you're on our side. You guys are great. I could never tell them apart, but their mother, can I ask? Can your mother tell you apart? And the answer is yes, easily, or is it tough for her? Easy? I think. Thank you very much. It's great to be with you. Let me say, the entire crypto community, for years, you were mocked and dismissed and counted out. You were counted out as little as a year and a half ago, but this signing is a massive validation. And even before the signing, over the last year, year and a half, I think your stuff has gone up more than any stock, or just about more a couple of stocks that were pretty good, I will say. But you, you have, certainly, as an industry, gone up more than anybody. Nobody has gained the respect in such a short period of time. But this signing is a massive validation of your hard work and your pioneering spirit and your ability to never give up, because a lot of people would have given up two three years ago. So I want to thank you for contributing to the incredible strength of America. This is going to make us stronger. Congratulations on this incredible achievement. You've made our dollar look really good and strong and powerful. It's good for the dollar and it's good for the country, and that's why I backed you at an early stage. And I also did it for the votes, because you did come out and vote. And they changed soon. You know, Biden's team, they changed tune right in the middle of the campaign. All of a sudden. They loved you guys. They dropped all charges. They did have, I got you guys out of so much trouble, because you remember, you remember they were very they treated you very unfairly, actually. So it's a great honor that we were involved and and it was, it was a tremendous amount of support that we got at the polls. We won. Think of it. We won every swing state. We won by millions of votes. We won the popular vote. We won the districts by 2700 districts too, by the way, every, every once in a while, that number can change, but it doesn't change by March, the map was almost totally red, and you guys were with us right from the beginning, exactly one year ago this month, many of you were with Nashville Tennessee. Do you remember that day? Right? It was a big day, Nashville Tennessee, and I became the first presidential candidate ever to address the Bitcoin Conference, and at this time and at that time, crypto members and founders were under relentless by the Biden administration, which is trying to crush your industry and crush you as people and go after vicious people don't realize the what Joe was doing guy but he was always known as a vicious guy. I guess if you're going to be in that you probably, if they're incompetent is better, right, because you don't want to have a vicious guy that's competent. If you did, I wouldn't be standing here today, but I pledge that we would bring back American liberty and leadership and make the United States the crypto capital of the world, and that's what we've done. And under the Trump administration, this is only going further, you're going to do really well. And I'm so proud of what you've done in the last couple of years. And very important. On day one, I remember I did this, and I said this, and I mentioned this name, and I got the greatest applause of the whole campaign. We fired Joe Biden's, sec chair, Gary Gensler, you a speech. It was just a line in speech. And I said, and I will fire Gary guessing, the place exploded. I finished that one, and I said, What the hell did that guy do? Hatred there turned out as I got for rigged with everything, it turned out you were absolutely right. In his place, I appointed a visionary chairman who wants America to build the future and not block the future. He's going to be unbelievable. He'll go down as one of the greats and fall at me. The crypto guys, they said, everybody said, not only crypto every they all wanted Paul for the position, and he's a tough cookie too. He's just but they actually said, We don't care. We just think he's fair. All they learned was fairness. And they have somebody that you're really a champion of the street and you're a champion of the country, you do a fantastic job. I saw you interviewed the other night. I watched it two o'clock in the morning, this little thing called Sea Spanish. I don't know how many people were watching. Don't worry, you were in prime time too with that. But fantastic job. Absolutely so perfect for the job. Congratulations, Paul and Paul is here today among the commissioners, various commissioners, including pastor Pierce and Laura. Thank you very much, and thank you, Mark, wherever you may be here because of the thunderous applause, tremendous things about both of you. Thank you very much. My first week in office, I also established the first ever presidential Working Group on digital assets, and we have an executive director wiz behind a football player, right? Bo is a great football player, one of the better players in college football. So who would think that I know that Daniel a lot of things from he was a genuine player. I stopped the weaponization of government against crypto or Bitcoin, and we ended the lawless operation. Choke point 2.0 that was a bad operation, and I kept my promises to the community and granted a full presidential pardon to Ross Ulbrich. No idea how. I had no idea how important that day became. Was like a symbol, and his mother was unbelievable. His mother was an unbelievable woman, but it was so, so important to a certain group of people. And in the truly momentous Act last March, I signed an executive order establishing the US Strategic Bitcoin reserve, as well as the United States Digital Asset stockpile, and that's all signed up, and With today's signing we're pushing even further into the exciting new frontier, just as I promised last year, the genius Act creates a clear and simple regulatory framework To establish and unleash the immense promise of dollar backed stable coins. This could have been perhaps the greatest revolution in financial technology since the birth of the Internet. So a lot of people are saying that. I don't know. What do you guys think? Yes, we'll tell you many Americans are unaware that behind the scenes, the technical backbone of the financial system is decades out of days, many, many years out of days. You know that Paul and others are straightening it out the payments and money transfers are costly and take days or even weeks to clear under this bill, the entire ancient system will be eligible for a 21st Century upgrade using the state of the art crypto technology. Who would have thought we would have been saying that two years after I met you for the first time, the genius Act provides banks, businesses and financial institutions, a framework for issuing crypto assets back one for one, with real us, dollars, treasury bills and other cash equivalents, is really strengthening the dollar and giving the dollar great prominence. And you know, you have this little group called bricks. It's fading out fast, but bricks is they wanted to try and take over the dollar, the dominance of the dollar, and the standard of the dollar. And I said, anybody that's in the BRICS consortium of nations, we're going to tariff you 10% and they had a meeting the following day, and almost nobody showed up. Physically, no, no, we didn't want to. They didn't want to be tariffed today. It's amazing. Now we're not going to let the dollar slide. If we have a smart president, you're never going to let the dollar slide. If you have a dummy that could happen, like the last one, he would have. You ever asked him about the dollar slide? He would have no idea. But we can't let that ever happen again. Consumers, vendors and people all over the world will then be able to use those stable coins for ultra low cost transactions that are cleared and settled in a matter of seconds, rather than weeks and months. And it's really an amazing thing with privacy, flexibility and decentralization of cash, this revolution has the potential to supercharge American economic growth and empower billions of people to study and transfer in US dollars. It's really all backed by the dollars. It's really a great thing. There'll be a lot of Democrat support. I have to tell you that I was shocked anytime we get one dem, but we had a tremendous amount of Democrat support, which we appreciated, which just shows you that you're doing the right thing. This will increase demand for US Treasuries, lower interest rates and secure the dollar's status as the world reserve currency for generations to come. The reserve currency is so important, you know, we lost that. That would be like losing a world war. We can never let anyone play games with us, and that's why, when I heard about this group from breaks six countries, basically, I hit them very, very hard, and they have a form. It will end very quickly. I will tell you to them. They won't. They won't be gone very long. I don't think they'll even they're virtually afraid to me, I also remain fully committed to my pledge never to allow the creation of a central bank digital currency in America will happen. You some of the Congress, men and women, and they wanted that so badly. You know, I was impressed that they knew what the hell it was to be honest. Please, sir, please the central bank, digital currency, will you have to make sure. And they say, What do you know about that? It's amazing the knowledge that people have made all of a sudden, we don't have problems with some of them. I said, we've already got it from the Fed, right from Congress and from an executive order. You don't need it a fourth house Sure. We have to get it. And it's but they knew their subject. I didn't, and we helped them out. My first week in office, I signed an executive order to ban the creation of a cbdc and the United States, and very soon, I look forward to signing legislation that will notify and ban the make it a permanent. Law put it in permanence. I'm also committed to selling animal crypto market structure legislation this year to grow the industry. We're going to be growing it even more, more than people ever thought. It's a really hot industry, and for a little while, two nights ago, we were really concerned, as we live short of bucks. I would say maybe we were about nine short, nine short at three in the morning. We were about four short at 330 in the morning, and we were in good shape at four o'clock in the morning. But the people, a few people, are fought harder for the bill that we're signing than some of the people here today. You have been unbelievable. It's our White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks and he has a show now become a show a couple of years ago. That's probably two years ago now in San Francisco, you kept it going a lot longer, and you got, is that still your eyes rated every show? Well, he knows what to say. Maybe 50 millions of people. They said, what's going on? But we had a great show. They said, You know, I had a really small decision. I get elected. I was running at that time, if I get elected, bring him into government and some of his work, unfortunately, we made a lot of money. They're very rich. He's a very rich media, but this is more important. Des, me too. It's like doesn't matter. This is much. I know how I talk about it all the time. How would you go back to those wonderful brokerage firm hire one or two people, and it's not the same. It's not the same as what you're doing, right? The biggest with one of the biggest deals in the world. Actually, the deal we're doing now in tariffs is the biggest where you ended up, the biggest deal ever made in history. It could be 1000 IBM, if you think of it. It's the biggest deal ever done. So it's hard to go back to a brokerage firm and $79,000 commission but I want to ask David, so David's been fantastic. He's done an incredible job. And I'd like to ask David come up say if you would. David Sacks Thank you, President Trump. It's a great Trump. It's a great, great honor to be here. And it's true that I never expected to work in government at all. And then everything changed after President Trump came on my podcast. And I, you know, I accepted this job as crypto as well because I thought it was a once in a lifetime opportunity to work for a President who really wants to get things done for the American people. And if anything, that's been an understatement. The first six months this administration have been more successful than any administration in American history. President Trump has worked at that tech speed we're used to working fast at Silicon Valley, but even this has passed for us in Silicon Valley, the speed of the team with President Trump's really incredible. And now today, you have another historic legislative achievement to make the United States a crypto capital of the world. This genius act will unlock American dominance in the crypto industry by creating clear rules of the road. It will update arcade payment rails with a revolutionary new payment system, and it will extend US dollar anonymous, like you said, globally by creating a digital dollar that people all over the world can use. And for every digital dollar in a crypto wallet, there'll be a traditional dollar in a US bank account, which will create trillions of dollars demand for US Treasuries. So that is the power of this bill, as you asked all the comments, this is a huge promise made and promise kept by President Trump. And there's just a few other people I'd like to thank, first, my family for being here. Thank you, fellow wise who President Trump mentioned, the director of our crypto Council. He released in a heavy lifting here, Tracy Johnson as well Harry and French Hill and all the congressman, senators, and we've already been met by President Trump, so I'll save the time, but it's really been hard for this is really a team effort, but most of all, to thank President Trump for accomplishing what nobody thought was possible. And it's true that just earlier this week, the media was reporting that this bill was dead. This bill was dead, and then the media didn't know one thing, that we have a secret weapon. We have a dealmakder in chief. And thanks to President Trump, he stepped in and save this bill, and it's because of your vision, your leadership, your determination, your skill that we're all here today. Donald Trump This is our superstar. She was the head of the Republican Party, and don't become beautiful two children, but she has been so good. She stepped into that position like there was nothing. That we want. And she said, Dad, I'd like to go home right now to my beautiful husband and my son and daughter, Rhett. They give you a fantastic job, and you work with a great gentleman too. He's doing a fantastic job. But I just want to thank you. I just need to stand here right now. I wanted to bring on. And thank you very much. Thank you. So under the Trump administration, as I just got back from Saudi Arabia, and we went to Qatar, we went to a number of countries, and I will tell you the the level of respect that this country has now is incredible. The UAE, I tell you what, we had a time there, but every leader said the same thing. They said, one year ago, your country was dead, and it said that way it was like supposed to be happy or insulted. But the truth is we were in deep trouble. But they said one year ago, your country was dead, and today you have the hottest country anywhere in the world. And it's true, we have the hottest country in the world. We had a country where a laughing stock with the borders, people pouring in. Can you imagine last month, in the month of June, actually zero. Now I don't even believe that zero, if you have hundreds of 1000s pouring in, or get over seven zero, but they have it down to zero. And very liberal people take that particular Oh, so liberal. So they're not giving us any fairness in zero people coming through a border. Can you imagine that for literally hundreds of people? All over the world. They came from prisons, jails. They came from mental institutions, gang members. They were gangs. They came from all over the place, from every country they came from the Congo and Africa. A lot from the Congo. They came from South America. A lot of came from Venezuela. They emptied their jails into our country. Can you imagine? They allowed that empty de jails into our country, and they let them walk right into our country like perfect, 11,888 committed murder. 50% committed more than one person. They murdered more than one person, 50% of 11,088 and we had murderers, and we're getting them out, and Tom Holman and Kristi are doing a great job at Town Hallman. Okay, you see central casting or what, and it takes abuse, but they just, they just keep fighting, and they're winning, and we're winning in the courts, and we're winning everywhere. But we've got the hottest country in the world, and you're a big part of it. So the golden age of America is upon us, and with today, signing the beauty of crypto and crypto industry and US dollar working together because they really are hand in hand, because they'll be stronger and bigger and better than ever before. And I just want to thank everybody, some tremendous people in this room, and maybe you want to sign I'll ask some of our great senators and congressmen to come on up, some of the top crypto guys, please come on up, because you guys work very hard on this, and we'll sign this, and we'll get on to the next panel, and we'll win. But we're we're winning all over the world right now. It's not even close, not even to us, and We're going to keep it going. Thank you, everybody. You world, which is a big scandal that we're a Republican, it would really be a big it is One of the great standards. Thank you Very much.",Policy|Donald Trump|stablecoin bill|News,EN,0,0,REGULATION|FIAT|ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-18 23:59:10
48503189,https://timestabloid.com/?p=74836,1752883207,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,No Asset Manager Has Filed for Shiba Inu (SHIB) ETF. Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/no-asset-manager-has-filed-for-shiba-inu-etf-heres-why/,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains one of the largest meme-based cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, currently valued at over $9 billion. Yet, despite its size and active community, SHIB has not been the subject of any exchange-traded fund (ETF) application from mainstream asset managers. This absence is notable given the increasing interest in launching ETFs for even smaller and less established meme coins. ETF Filings Surge for Smaller Meme Coins Since January 2025, institutional interest in meme coin ETFs has accelerated. Dogecoin (DOGE) has led the trend, with multiple filings from asset managers including Rex Shares, Osprey Funds, and Bitwise. Grayscale submitted a proposal to convert its Dogecoin Trust into an ETF earlier this year, and 21Shares followed with a DOGE ETF application in April. Other tokens have also entered the ETF conversation. TRUMP coin was included in applications from Rex Shares and Osprey, and BONK, a Solana-based meme token, was listed in those same filings. By March, Canary Capital filed for a PENGU ETF, despite the token having a significantly lower market cap of just $1.9 billion. The rapid inclusion of lesser-known and lower-value tokens in ETF proposals has raised questions about SHIB’s absence, especially considering its significantly stronger market position. Lack of Transparent Leadership May Be a Barrier One of the key differences between SHIB and its ETF-listed peers may lie in its leadership structure. While Dogecoin operates as a decentralized project with no central figurehead, and TRUMP coin benefits from the public persona of the U.S. president, Shiba Inu’s development team remains anonymous. The lead figure behind SHIB, known pseudonymously as Shytoshi Kusama, has chosen to maintain their privacy despite taking on a visible role within the community. For regulatory-conscious asset managers, this lack of identifiable leadership may present concerns regarding project oversight and accountability, two factors that are often considered when evaluating ETF candidates. Absence of High-Profile Endorsements Another factor limiting institutional interest in SHIB may be its lack of prominent public endorsements. DOGE has benefited from the vocal support of Elon Musk and Mark Cuban, while TRUMP coin is explicitly tied to Donald Trump. These associations have played a significant role in increasing visibility and driving investor attention. SHIB, on the other hand, does not enjoy similar backing from well-known figures. Its popularity has grown primarily through grassroots momentum, which, although powerful, may not be as appealing to ETF issuers who often rely on mainstream media visibility and public sentiment to gauge investment potential. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Complex Ecosystem and Project Maturity Shiba Inu also differs from simpler tokens like DOGE in terms of its technical infrastructure. It has developed a broader ecosystem, including the ShibaSwap decentralized exchange, Shibarium (a Layer 2 blockchain), NFTs, and plans for a metaverse. While this signals innovation, it may also complicate its suitability for a traditional ETF, which typically favors clear, singular use cases. Moreover, some of SHIB’s initiatives are still under development. Its tokenomics, such as the token burn mechanism and broader DeFi integration, are ongoing, which may lead asset managers to conclude that the project has not yet reached a mature or stable enough phase for ETF inclusion. Despite being the second-largest meme coin by market capitalization, Shiba Inu has not yet attracted the attention of institutional ETF issuers. A combination of anonymous leadership, absence of celebrity affiliation, and a complex, evolving ecosystem may be contributing factors. Unless SHIB improves its institutional appeal, either through increased transparency or greater mainstream visibility, it may continue to be overlooked in the current wave of meme coin ETF applications.

48503193,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=338561,1752883218,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/dailyhodl.png,Brand-New Ethereum Ecosystem Altcoin Rips by Over 80% on First Day of Trading After Coinbase and Binance Listings,https://dailyhodl.com/2025/07/18/brand-new-ethereum-ecosystem-altcoin-rips-by-nearly-80-on-first-day-of-trading-after-coinbase-and-binance-listings/,"A brand-new Ethereum ( ETH ) ecosystem altcoin is skyrocketing after immediately securing listings on Binance and Coinbase. Caldera ( ERA ) is an application that allows the development of ETH-based layer-2 scaling solutions. The new ERA token launched on Thursday surged over 80% in just hours before continuing its rally to an all-time high of $2. ERA has given up some of its gains and is trading at $1.56 at time of writing. Coinbase listed the asset with an experimental label on Thursday. The top US crypto exchange uses the experimental label for tokens that pose certain risks, such as price swings and canceled orders, because of lower trading volume and availability. Binance, the largest crypto exchange platform in the world, had already announced the day before that it would support the asset via its HODLer Airdrops program. The HODLer Airdrops program, launched in 2024, rewards investors holding BNB with crypto assets based on previous snapshots of their balances. Caldera, which refers to itself as “the internet of rollups,” says on its official website that its metalayer enables developers to launch interoperable rollups – layer-2 blockchains designed to scale Ethereum by batching and compressing transactions off-chain before finalizing them on Ethereum. Caldera’s market cap has already surged past $263 million on its first day of trading.

Tapestry specializes in designing and retailing high-end fashion accessories, leveraging its iconic brands to capture the growing demand for luxury lifestyle products. The company’s strong cash flows and strategic share-repurchase program may have also caught Sarma’s eye, with SRS Investment Management now allocating about 4.5% of the hedge fund’s portfolio to the new investment. That makes Tapestry the fourth-largest allocation at SRS, following Pdd Holdings Inc. at 6.45%, Planet Fitness Inc. at 6.09%, and Meta Platforms Inc. at 5.75%, highlighting a strategic focus on e-commerce, fitness, AI and tech, alongside luxury retail.

According to diligent monitoring by Bitcoin World market analytics, BTC soared to $118,012.31 on the Binance USDT market, sending ripples of optimism throughout the entire financial landscape. This remarkable achievement isn’t just a number; it represents a powerful testament to Bitcoin’s enduring strength, growing adoption, and its potential as a global store of value. For investors, enthusiasts, and even skeptics, this latest milestone prompts a crucial question: what exactly is driving this monumental rise, and what does it signify for the future of finance? Understanding the Monumental BTC Surge: What Does $118,000 Mean? When we talk about a BTC surge past such a formidable level, it’s essential to grasp the sheer significance. Reaching $118,000 is not merely an incremental gain; it often indicates a breakthrough past major psychological resistance levels or even, depending on the market cycle, a new all-time high. This specific price point reflects renewed investor confidence and substantial capital inflow. Historically, Bitcoin’s price movements are characterized by periods of consolidation followed by explosive rallies, often fueled by a confluence of factors. This latest move could signal the beginning of another significant leg up in its long-term trajectory. It underscores the increasing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies and their growing integration into traditional financial systems. Consider the journey Bitcoin has taken since its inception. From humble beginnings to now commanding such a high valuation, each milestone, especially a significant one like $118,000, reinforces its position as a leading financial innovation. This price action serves as a powerful indicator of demand outstripping supply, a fundamental economic principle driving value. What’s Fueling This Remarkable Bitcoin Price Rally? The ascent of Bitcoin price to new heights is rarely due to a single cause. Instead, it’s typically a complex interplay of macroeconomic trends, institutional interest, supply dynamics, and evolving market sentiment. Understanding these drivers is crucial for anyone looking to navigate the volatile yet rewarding world of digital assets. Institutional Embrace: The Big Players Are In One of the most significant catalysts behind recent Bitcoin rallies has been the growing embrace from institutional investors and large corporations. Companies like MicroStrategy have famously added substantial amounts of Bitcoin to their balance sheets, viewing it as a superior treasury reserve asset. Furthermore, the approval and success of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in various jurisdictions have opened the floodgates for traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. These ETFs represent a massive pipeline for capital from pension funds, endowments, and wealth managers, providing a level of legitimacy and accessibility previously unavailable. This institutional demand creates consistent buying pressure, underpinning the rally. Macroeconomic Tailwinds: Inflation and Interest Rates In an era of fluctuating inflation rates and evolving central bank policies, Bitcoin’s narrative as a ‘digital gold’ or a hedge against inflation has gained considerable traction. As traditional currencies face inflationary pressures, investors seek alternative stores of value that are decentralized and supply-capped. Bitcoin, with its fixed supply of 21 million coins, presents an attractive option. Additionally, a dovish stance by central banks, leading to lower interest rates, can make yield-bearing traditional assets less appealing, pushing investors towards higher-growth, risk-on assets like Bitcoin. Supply Dynamics: Halving and Scarcity Bitcoin undergoes a ‘halving’ event approximately every four years, which cuts the reward for mining new blocks by half. This mechanism is hardcoded into Bitcoin’s protocol, ensuring its scarcity. Each halving reduces the rate at which new Bitcoin enters circulation, thereby increasing its inherent scarcity over time. Post-halving periods have historically been followed by significant bull runs, as reduced supply meets growing demand. While the most recent halving might be some time ago, its long-term effects on supply dynamics continue to influence the market’s perception of Bitcoin’s value. Retail Resurgence: The People’s Power While institutional money provides significant buying power, the collective interest of retail investors should not be underestimated. Social media trends, mainstream news coverage, and the ‘fear of missing out’ (FOMO) often drive substantial retail participation. As Bitcoin’s price climbs, it captures headlines, attracting new individual investors who see the potential for significant returns. This grassroots interest, coupled with easy access through various trading platforms, adds another layer of demand to the market. Navigating the Crypto Market: Key Dynamics and Investor Sentiment The current Crypto market landscape is complex, influenced by a myriad of technical indicators, on-chain data, and prevailing sentiment. For those participating or considering entry, understanding these dynamics is paramount. Technical Outlook: Key Levels and Indicators From a technical analysis perspective, breaking past $118,000 is a highly bullish signal. It suggests that previous resistance has now flipped into support, potentially paving the way for further upward movement. Traders often look at key moving averages (e.g., 50-day, 200-day), the Relative Strength Index (RSI), and trading volumes to gauge the strength and sustainability of a rally. High volume accompanying a price surge indicates strong conviction from buyers. Conversely, a lack of volume on a price rise might suggest a weaker rally prone to correction. Table: Key Market Indicators to Watch Indicator What it Tells Us Implication for Bitcoin’s $118K Surge Trading Volume Strength of price movement High volume confirms strong buying interest Relative Strength Index (RSI) Overbought/Oversold conditions Indicates if the rally is sustainable or due for a pullback Moving Averages Trend direction and support/resistance Price above key MAs confirms bullish trend On-Chain Metrics Network activity, whale movements Growing adoption and accumulation by large holders On-Chain Metrics: What the Data Says Beyond traditional charts, on-chain analytics provide deeper insights into Bitcoin’s network health and investor behavior. Metrics such as exchange inflows/outflows, active addresses, and miner accumulation patterns can reveal underlying trends. For instance, decreasing Bitcoin balances on exchanges suggest investors are moving their holdings to cold storage, indicating a long-term holding sentiment rather than an intent to sell. Increased active addresses signal growing network utility and adoption. These data points often provide a more fundamental view of market strength than mere price action. The Volatility Factor: A Double-Edged Sword While the surge past $118,000 is exciting, it’s crucial to remember Bitcoin’s inherent volatility. Sharp price swings, both upwards and downwards, are common. This volatility presents opportunities for significant gains but also carries substantial risks. Investors must be prepared for potential corrections and understand that not every upward move is sustainable in the short term. Prudent risk management and a long-term perspective are essential when dealing with such dynamic assets. Investing in Digital Assets: Opportunities and Challenges Ahead The burgeoning world of Digital assets offers unparalleled opportunities but also presents unique challenges that investors must navigate carefully. The recent Bitcoin rally highlights both sides of this coin. Benefits of Investing in Bitcoin and Digital Assets Diversification: Bitcoin often exhibits low correlation with traditional assets, offering portfolio diversification benefits. Inflation Hedge: Its fixed supply makes it an attractive hedge against currency debasement. Technological Innovation: Investing in Bitcoin is also an investment in the underlying blockchain technology, which is poised to revolutionize various industries. Global Accessibility: Digital assets can be accessed by anyone with an internet connection, fostering financial inclusion. Challenges and Risks Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, with potential for new rules that could impact the market. Market Manipulation: The relatively smaller size of the crypto market compared to traditional markets can make it more susceptible to large whale movements or coordinated pumps and dumps. Security Risks: While blockchain technology is secure, individual investors face risks from hacks, phishing scams, and loss of private keys. High Volatility: As mentioned, rapid price swings can lead to significant losses if not managed properly. Actionable Insights for Investors For those considering investing or already holding Bitcoin, a few actionable insights can help navigate the current market. Always conduct your own research (DYOR) before making any investment decisions. Understand your risk tolerance and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Dollar-cost averaging, where you invest a fixed amount regularly regardless of price, can help mitigate volatility. Diversifying your crypto portfolio beyond just Bitcoin, if appropriate for your risk profile, can also be a sound strategy. Staying informed about market news, regulatory developments, and technological advancements is key to long-term success. Expert Market Analysis: What Lies Ahead for Bitcoin? Following this impressive surge, the question on everyone’s mind is: what does the future hold for Bitcoin? Expert Market analysis suggests several potential scenarios, but certainty remains elusive in such a dynamic market. Potential Resistance Levels and Price Targets With Bitcoin crossing $118,000, analysts will be eyeing the next psychological and technical resistance levels. These could be round numbers like $120,000, $125,000, or even higher if the bullish momentum continues. Fibonacci extensions and historical price action are often used to project potential future targets. A strong break and sustained trading above these levels would reinforce the bullish narrative, potentially leading to an accelerated rally. Bullish and Bearish Scenarios Bullish Scenario: Continued institutional adoption, further ETF approvals globally, favorable regulatory clarity, and sustained macroeconomic pressures on fiat currencies could propel Bitcoin to even greater heights. A narrative of Bitcoin becoming a global reserve asset or a widely accepted medium of exchange would solidify its long-term growth potential. Bearish Scenario: Conversely, unexpected regulatory crackdowns in major economies, a significant global economic recession, or a major security breach affecting a prominent exchange could trigger a substantial correction. Any loss of confidence in the underlying technology or a shift in the macroeconomic environment could also dampen enthusiasm. Ultimately, the trajectory of Bitcoin will depend on a delicate balance of these forces. While the current momentum is strong, a cautious and informed approach remains the best strategy for investors. Conclusion: A New Era for Digital Assets Bitcoin’s spectacular rise above $118,000 is more than just a price milestone; it’s a powerful affirmation of its growing stature in the global financial system. This BTC surge is a culmination of increasing institutional interest, favorable macroeconomic conditions, inherent scarcity, and renewed retail enthusiasm. While the path ahead for the Crypto market will undoubtedly involve its share of volatility and challenges, the underlying trends suggest a continued expansion and integration of Digital assets into mainstream finance. For those seeking to understand and participate in this revolution, staying informed and exercising prudence, guided by sound Market analysis , will be paramount. The future of finance is rapidly evolving, and Bitcoin continues to lead the charge, promising an exciting, albeit unpredictable, journey ahead. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What caused Bitcoin’s recent surge past $118,000? The recent surge is attributed to a combination of factors, including increased institutional adoption (like Bitcoin ETFs), macroeconomic conditions such as inflation concerns driving demand for inflation hedges, Bitcoin’s inherent scarcity due to its halving mechanism, and renewed interest from retail investors. 2. Is $118,000 an all-time high for Bitcoin? While Bitcoin has seen significant rallies, whether $118,000 is an all-time high depends on the specific market cycle and historical data at the time of this surge. However, it represents a highly significant psychological and technical milestone, indicating strong bullish momentum and breaking past previous resistance levels. 3. How does this surge impact the broader crypto market? Bitcoin’s strong performance often acts as a leading indicator for the broader crypto market. A significant Bitcoin rally typically creates positive sentiment, leading to an ‘altcoin season’ where other cryptocurrencies also experience price increases, though often with higher volatility. 4. What are the risks of investing in Bitcoin at this price? Investing in Bitcoin, especially after a significant surge, carries risks such as high volatility (potential for rapid price corrections), regulatory uncertainty, security risks (e.g., exchange hacks, personal key loss), and the inherent speculative nature of the asset. It’s crucial to understand these risks before investing. 5. Should I invest in Bitcoin now? Investment decisions should always be based on your personal financial situation, risk tolerance, and thorough research. While the current rally is exciting, it’s advisable to avoid making impulsive decisions. Consider strategies like dollar-cost averaging and consult with a financial advisor if unsure. 6.

Bank of England Governor Andrew Baile recently noted that he would rather banks create a tokenized central bank deposit than a new private stablecoin. According to JPMorgan analysts, this is part of a larger breaking wave of regulation worldwide toward tokenized deposits , a more holistic and secure method, the authors claim, of modernizing finance. Tokenized deposit, a digital analogue of a conventional bank deposit, is released within the blockchain executor, and information is reflected in it. They preserve the protections encoded in the existing financial system, such as deposit insurance, compliance with know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) rules, and access to central bank emergency funding. On the other hand, tokenized deposits imply that some parts of the benefits of the blockchain are already in place, such as time-to-settlement, visibility, programmability, and the possibility to interact with smart contracts. Authorities endorse non-bearer digital bank money According to JPMorgan analysts, there are two tokenized deposit types: bearer and non-bearer. A bearer tokenised deposit may be transferred and traded among parties. But as with anything else in the market, their value can go down, too, based on the interplay of supply and demand, or the risk of the issuer. This volatility is a menace to financial calm. It violates the central value proposition of “singleness of money” — the belief that all money in circulation within a nation’s borders can safely be exchanged for a stable quantity of goods and services. Non-bearer tokenized deposits, on the contrary, are non-transferable. They facilitate two-bank-to-two-bank, straight-through settlement of transactions, in central bank money, at one-to-one value. According to JPMorgan, the system helps protect the financial system’s integrity and prevents value differentials between the different forms of money. The analysts pointed to a paper, “Stablecoins versus tokenized deposits: implications for the singleness of money,” released in 2023, by economists Rod Garratt and Hyun Song Shin. But more ominously, the paper warns that transferable tokens, whether stablecoins or bearer deposits, “tend towards pricing error.” According to JPMorgan, non-bearer tokenized deposits offer greater certainty and interoperability within the banking sector. Their design ensures that when funds are transferred between banks, they retain their full face value—much like a standard electronic bank transfer—without any reduction or “haircut.” Traders favor stablecoins for liquidity Stablecoins have faced increasing regulatory scrutiny but remain powerful in the crypto economy . With high liquidity and universal availability on all markets, their simple movable nature attracts cryptos, Decentralized Exchange (DEX) traders, and remittances worldwide. Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) remain the top stablecoins by market cap. They represent hundreds of billions of dollars daily across crypto exchanges, DeFi protocols, and remittance corridors. However, JPMorgan analysts said stablecoins typically don’t take money away from the banking system. Their reserves, which they have lent domestically, typically in short-term government securities such as United States Treasury bills, stay within the traditional finance channels. It’s the money market fund model, in which deposits are collected and invested in low-risk, short-term instruments. The JPMorgan analysts also asked if commercial banks would have cheaper issuance of stablecoins. A 2023 consultation paper from the Bank of England proposed that any bank issuing stablecoins could be held to back them with fully reserved deposits at the central bank, and these deposits might not pay interest. “All of that would put serious constraints on a bank’s ability to price to yield on customer deposits, as a stablecoin would be a very unappetizing business proposition under those rules. In the United States, meanwhile, regulatory sentiment remains friendlier to stablecoins. It will be law shortly after President Donald Trump signs the new GENIUS Act. Under the Act, banks could create stablecoins and incorporate them into the existing payment system. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Before he'd signed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act into law after it swept through both chambers of Congress with major bipartisan votes, Trump basked in cheers and thanked several industry leaders in the East Room audience, including Tether CEO Paulo Ardoino, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. Outside, the executives talked about next steps. Ardoino amplified his plans for moving some of his global business into the U.S., where he said the focus will be on institutional users for a new token, but he added that he also intends to have Tether's stablecoin powerhouse USDT comply with the GENIUS Act as a foreign issuer. That'll mean a new auditing regime and changes to the vast reserves the company already maintains, which he says will require ""an adjustment"" but noted — with a smile — that his company ""made $13 billion in profits "" last year and will be able to manage it. ""Tether will comply with the GENIUS Act,"" he said, adding that the company will get to work now meeting the foreign-issuer standards. He said Tether has three years to work on getting into the U.S., and the company intends to manage two different versions of its stablecoins domestically — a jurisdiction it currently steers clear of. The U.S.-centric coin — a second flavor of Tether that hasn't yet been hatched — is envisioned as serving a very different purpose. ""Institutions are used to super efficient markets, and they will count the single basis point; and so, for that reason, we need to build something that is proper for this new market,"" he told CoinDesk in the interview. The product built for those institutions will ""focus on payments and high, high, high efficiency."" Circle's Allaire For Circle — a public company based in the U.S. — CEO Allaire said that the GENIUS Act ""really enshrines into law Circle's way of doing business."" ""We have always been trusted, transparent; we've been publicly audited for five years,"" he said. But he noted that the U.S. landscape for stablecoins has already been rapidly changing in anticipation of the new law, with ""major technology companies, major commerce firms, financial institutions"" lining up to participate, which he said he welcomes. ""Once you have that federal law, it really is a green light to all these types of institutions to know that they can depend on this technology, build on this technology, integrated into how they store and move money into other innovations that can be done with smart contracts and programabilities,"" Allaire said. To do business in the U.S., the GENIUS Act demands that extremely limited, highly liquid assets — mostly U.S. Treasuries — will back issuers' coins dollar-for-dollar, and it requires a stringent auditing process to constantly ensure that the assets are there. Tether's Ardoino said his company's new chief financial officer , Simon McWilliams, ""started to work"" to land a ""Big Four"" audit firm — one of the global leaders in financial auditing — which has only been a possibility because of the recent support from the Trump administration. His company has a special relationship with the administration , too, in which the former CEO of Tether's chief U.S. reserves manager, Cantor Fitzgerald, is Trump's secretary of commerce, Howard Lutnick. Ardoino's appearance at the White House and direct thanks from the president is a sharp reversal of Tether's U.S. history, in which it settled investigations with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and New York Department of Financial Services. But past reports that the company remained under further U.S. investigation never developed into actions against the company or its officers. Trump boasted repeatedly on Friday that he dug the crypto industry out of legal trouble with his predecessor's administration. Coinbase's Armstrong A company that's developed into a lobbying and political giant in Washington in a short period, Coinbase, was represented in Trump's front row at the White House event, and CEO Brian Armstrong called the new law the ""beginning of a big financial revolution in the U.S."" Armstrong has spent a lot of time and effort, though, on the next major legislation pursued by the industry: a bill that sets regulations for crypto markets in the U.S. ""One down; one to go,"" he said. ""We've got to get the market structure bill through, as well. Seven percent of crypto market cap is stabecoins, so that's a very important first step. The other 93% is going to be addressed by that market structure bill."" In the minutes before passing the GENIUS Act, the House of Representatives also voted 294-134 to send its market structure legislation known as the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act to the Senate with a resounding bipartisan result. Armstrong's company has been one of the primary backers of political action committee Fairshake, a towering super PAC that's spent incredible amounts of money congressional races, supporting candidates who commit to pro-crypto legislation. After success in dozens of races last year, Coinbase's largesse continued with another recent $25 million addition that brought Fairshake's war chest to $141 million well before the genuine start of next year's races. ""We feel like it's important to stand up for our customers' rights, and the job's not done yet,"" he said. Even after the market structure bill, he said, ""I'm sure there'll be other things that come up in the future."" Armstrong said that Trump's chief crypto adviser, David Sacks, has assured the industry that he's serious about a recently discussed deadline for the next congressional effort: September 30. For his part, President Trump talked about the GENIUS Act as if he'd already accomplished the monumental task of lifting U.S. crypto into place to modernize the financial system. ""Under this bill, the entire ancient system will be eligible for a 21st Century upgrade, using the state-of-the-art crypto technology,"" the president said before sitting at a table to sign the bill, mobbed by Republican lawmakers and crypto executives. ""Tomorrow is a new day, a new era,"" Ardoino said after the event. ""We are very proud to be here and to be called out directly from the president, because it is the testament of all the good work that our team has done for the last years.""

This initiative suggests a strategic foray into a more centralized domain, specifically planning a launch on Kraken’s Ink network. This move, as cited by DL News from a DAO proposal published on July 17, represents a significant departure from Aave’s traditionally decentralized ethos and has ignited a crucial debate within the crypto community. What’s Driving Aave DAO’s Bold Foray onto Kraken Ink? The core of this ambitious proposal involves deploying a licensed, centralized version of the Aave codebase onto Kraken’s layer-2 Ink blockchain. This isn’t just a simple port; it’s a strategic decision to create a distinct, managed platform. The new entity will operate under a different name, managed directly by the Ink Foundation, with a portion of the generated revenue flowing back to the Aave DAO . This arrangement signals a willingness to explore hybrid models that bridge the gap between the wild west of DeFi and the regulated world of traditional finance. Several factors could be motivating this bold strategic shift: Regulatory Clarity: The DeFi space has long grappled with regulatory uncertainty. By operating on a centralized, licensed platform like Kraken Ink, Aave could potentially achieve greater regulatory compliance, making its services more palatable to institutional investors and traditional financial entities. Institutional Adoption: Traditional finance (TradFi) institutions often shy away from the perceived risks and lack of oversight in pure DeFi. A centralized version, backed by a reputable exchange like Kraken, could open doors to a vast pool of institutional capital, bringing new liquidity and users to the Aave ecosystem. User Experience: While DeFi offers unparalleled freedom, it often comes with a steep learning curve and complex user interfaces. A centralized platform on Kraken Ink could offer a more streamlined, user-friendly experience, potentially attracting a broader, less crypto-native audience. Revenue Diversification: The proposed revenue share arrangement provides a new, potentially stable income stream for the Aave DAO, diversifying its financial base beyond just protocol fees from the decentralized Aave. Navigating the Centralized Aave Frontier: Benefits and Potential Pitfalls The concept of a centralized Aave is inherently paradoxical for many in the DeFi community. However, understanding both the upsides and the potential downsides is crucial for appreciating the full scope of this proposal. The Strategic Benefits: This move could unlock significant growth avenues: Expanded Market Reach: By operating within a regulated framework on a reputable platform like Kraken, Aave could tap into a much larger user base, including institutional players and retail users who prefer regulated environments. Enhanced Security & Compliance: Centralized platforms typically offer more robust security measures and adhere to stringent KYC/AML (Know Your Customer/Anti-Money Laundering) regulations, which can build trust and reduce certain types of financial risk. Innovation & Experimentation: The Ink network could serve as a testing ground for new features and products that might be difficult to implement on the main decentralized Aave protocol due to governance complexities or regulatory hurdles. The Inherent Challenges and Concerns: Despite the potential benefits, the proposal faces significant scrutiny: Erosion of Decentralization Ethos: The most prominent concern is the perceived compromise of DeFi’s core principle – decentralization. Aave was built on the promise of censorship resistance and permissionless access, which a centralized version inherently contradicts. Community Backlash: Many within the Aave community are staunch proponents of decentralization. This move could lead to internal dissent and potentially alienate a segment of its loyal user base. Single Points of Failure: Centralized systems are typically more vulnerable to single points of failure, whether due to technical glitches, regulatory pressure, or malicious attacks, compared to distributed decentralized networks. Brand Dilution: There’s a risk that launching a centralized version could dilute the Aave brand, blurring the lines between its core decentralized offering and this new, distinct entity. How Does This Impact the Future of DeFi Lending? The Aave DAO’s proposal could be a bellwether for the broader DeFi lending sector. It suggests a potential shift in strategy for established DeFi protocols, where a hybrid model might become increasingly common. Instead of a strict dichotomy between decentralized and centralized finance, we might see more protocols exploring avenues to bridge the two worlds. This move could: Accelerate Mainstream Adoption: If successful, it could demonstrate a viable path for DeFi technologies to gain widespread acceptance in regulated financial markets, paving the way for other protocols. Redefine ‘DeFi’: The lines between DeFi and TradFi might become increasingly blurred, leading to a new category of ‘CeDeFi’ (Centralized Decentralized Finance) or ‘Hybrid Finance’ solutions that leverage blockchain technology while operating within existing regulatory frameworks. Increase Competition: As more regulated blockchain platforms emerge, the competition for institutional and retail users seeking compliant DeFi-like services will intensify. Exploring the Kraken Ink Blockchain Network: A Strategic Choice Kraken’s choice as the launchpad for this centralized Aave initiative is far from arbitrary. The blockchain network , Ink, developed by Kraken, is a Layer-2 solution designed to offer high throughput, low fees, and potentially enhanced regulatory compliance, making it an attractive environment for a centralized DeFi product. Key aspects of Kraken Ink: Layer-2 Scalability: Built to handle a high volume of transactions efficiently, addressing one of the common challenges faced by many Layer-1 blockchains. Kraken’s Reputation: As one of the oldest and most reputable cryptocurrency exchanges, Kraken brings a significant level of trust, security expertise, and a large existing user base to the table. This reputation is invaluable for a centralized financial product. Focus on Compliance: While details are still emerging, Ink is likely designed with regulatory considerations in mind, which aligns perfectly with Aave’s apparent goal of attracting institutional players. This collaboration highlights a growing trend where established crypto exchanges are not just facilitating trading but are also building their own blockchain infrastructure to support a new generation of financial products. Actionable Insights for Aave Community and Crypto Investors For those invested in or following the Aave ecosystem and the broader crypto market, this proposal demands close attention. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor DAO Governance: Keep a close eye on the Aave DAO’s voting process. The outcome will significantly impact Aave’s future trajectory and its brand perception. Understand the Nuances: Differentiate between the existing decentralized Aave protocol and the proposed centralized version on Ink. They are distinct entities, even if sharing a codebase. Assess Risk & Reward: Evaluate how this move might affect Aave’s tokenomics, user base, and overall market position. Consider the long-term implications for both decentralized and centralized crypto offerings. Diversify Your Portfolio: As the crypto landscape evolves with new hybrid models, it’s prudent to diversify investments across various protocols and platforms that align with your risk tolerance and philosophical stance on decentralization. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Aave and DeFi’s Evolution The Aave DAO proposal to launch a centralized version on Kraken’s Ink network marks a truly pivotal moment, not just for Aave, but for the entire DeFi ecosystem. It’s a bold experiment that challenges the conventional wisdom of decentralization while seeking to unlock new frontiers of growth and adoption. While it presents compelling opportunities for regulatory clarity, institutional engagement, and broader market reach, it also raises fundamental questions about the core tenets of DeFi and the potential for brand identity shifts. The success or failure of this venture will undoubtedly provide valuable lessons, shaping the future trajectory of how decentralized protocols interact with centralized entities and traditional finance.

While Bitcoin often steals the headlines, another digital asset is steadily gaining ground in the boardrooms of publicly traded companies: Ethereum . In a move that signals a significant shift in institutional investment strategies, Sharplink Gaming, a Nasdaq-listed entity, has announced an extraordinary plan to bolster its Ethereum reserves, signaling a new era for corporate treasury management. Unveiling Sharplink Gaming’s Strategic Move into Ethereum Imagine a company, publicly traded on one of the world’s most prestigious stock exchanges, deciding to allocate billions of dollars not to traditional assets, but to a volatile, decentralized digital currency. That’s precisely what Sharplink Gaming is doing. The company, known for its strategic accumulation of Ethereum (ETH) as a core reserve asset, recently filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to sell up to an additional $5 billion in common stock. The sole purpose? To fund further ETH purchases for its corporate treasury. This isn’t a small, speculative play. This is a monumental commitment. According to reports, this prospectus supplement elevates the total stock sale limit under their existing sales agreement to a staggering $6 billion. This comprises $1 billion from a prior prospectus and the fresh $5 billion infusion. Such a substantial financial maneuver by Sharplink Gaming underscores a growing confidence among some corporate leaders in the long-term value and strategic importance of digital assets like Ethereum. But why Ethereum? While Bitcoin is often lauded as ‘digital gold’ due to its scarcity and store-of-value properties, Ethereum offers a different value proposition. It’s the foundational layer for a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and the broader Web3 movement. For a company like Sharplink Gaming, which operates in a dynamic, tech-forward industry, aligning with the leading smart contract platform could be seen as a strategic move to future-proof its operations and potentially participate in the burgeoning digital economy. Why the Colossal Stock Sale? Fueling Corporate Treasury with ETH The decision to raise capital through a significant stock sale to acquire digital assets is not taken lightly by any publicly traded company. It involves careful consideration of shareholder value, market perception, and risk management. For Sharplink Gaming, this move suggests a profound belief in Ethereum’s potential, not just as an investment, but as a strategic component of its corporate treasury . Historically, corporate treasuries primarily focused on managing cash, short-term investments, and liquidity, often in low-yield traditional assets. However, in an era of persistent inflation concerns and a search for alternative alpha, companies are increasingly exploring non-traditional assets. Here’s why some companies are looking at crypto: Inflation Hedge: Digital assets, particularly those with capped supplies or strong utility, are seen by some as a hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Diversification: Adding crypto provides diversification away from traditional financial instruments, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk (though introducing new types of risk). Potential for High Returns: While volatile, the crypto market has historically offered significant returns, attracting companies willing to take on calculated risks for potentially higher yields. Innovation & Future-Proofing: For tech-centric companies, holding crypto can signal an embrace of innovation and a readiness to engage with the future of finance and technology. Balance Sheet Strength: If crypto holdings appreciate significantly, they can bolster a company’s balance sheet, enhancing its financial standing and investor confidence. Sharplink Gaming’s strategy is reminiscent of MicroStrategy’s pioneering Bitcoin acquisition, which set a precedent for corporate crypto adoption. However, Sharplink’s focus on Ethereum highlights a growing appreciation for ETH’s unique utility and its role in the decentralized internet. By using a stock sale, Sharplink is effectively inviting investors to participate in its crypto strategy, demonstrating transparency and a clear intent. The Broader Implications of Institutional Crypto Adoption Sharplink Gaming’s bold step is not an isolated incident; rather, it’s a powerful indicator of the accelerating trend of institutional crypto adoption . When a Nasdaq-listed company commits such a substantial sum to a digital asset, it sends ripples throughout the financial world. What does this mean for the broader market? Increased Legitimacy and Acceptance: Each time a major institution or publicly traded company invests in crypto, it adds a layer of legitimacy to the asset class. This can help chip away at the skepticism that still surrounds cryptocurrencies in some traditional financial circles, paving the way for wider acceptance. Market Impact: Large-scale purchases by institutions can have a significant impact on market dynamics. While the $5 billion will likely be deployed over time to avoid excessive price disruption, such sustained buying pressure for Ethereum could contribute to its price stability and growth over the long term. It also signals strong demand from a new class of buyers. Regulatory Scrutiny and Clarity: As more institutions enter the crypto space, regulators are compelled to provide clearer guidelines and frameworks. This increased institutional participation could accelerate the development of comprehensive regulatory clarity, which is crucial for the crypto market’s maturation and continued growth. Shifting Investment Paradigms: The move by Sharplink Gaming encourages other companies to re-evaluate their own treasury strategies. It sparks conversations in boardrooms about the potential benefits and risks of incorporating digital assets into corporate balance sheets. This could lead to a broader paradigm shift in how companies manage their capital and reserves. Sharplink Gaming’s substantial investment in Ethereum signals a growing trend of corporate interest in digital assets. Navigating the Future: Challenges and Opportunities for Crypto Investment While the allure of digital assets like Ethereum is undeniable, especially for those seeking innovative investment avenues, it’s crucial to acknowledge the inherent challenges. For a company like Sharplink Gaming, venturing into significant crypto investment brings both immense opportunities and considerable risks that must be carefully managed. Key Challenges: Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile. Price swings of 10-20% or more in a single day are not uncommon, which can significantly impact a company’s balance sheet and reported earnings. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Changes in laws or interpretations can have profound effects on the market and the legality of holding certain assets. Security Risks: Storing large amounts of digital assets requires robust security measures to prevent hacks, theft, or loss. This necessitates sophisticated cold storage solutions and multi-signature wallets. Accounting Treatment: The accounting rules for cryptocurrencies are complex and can vary by jurisdiction, making it challenging for companies to accurately report their holdings and valuations. Public Perception: Despite growing acceptance, some traditional investors may view significant crypto holdings as overly risky or speculative, potentially impacting stock performance. Compelling Opportunities: Long-Term Growth Potential: Proponents believe that Ethereum, as the backbone of Web3, has substantial long-term growth potential as the digital economy expands. Technological Alignment: For tech companies, holding ETH can facilitate direct participation in decentralized ecosystems, enabling future innovation or service offerings built on blockchain. Signaling Innovation: A bold move into crypto can position a company as forward-thinking and innovative, attracting a new generation of investors and talent. Liquidity: Major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum are highly liquid, allowing for relatively easy entry and exit from positions, though large-scale sales can still impact prices. Sharplink Gaming’s move is a testament to their calculated assessment of these factors, indicating a belief that the long-term opportunities outweigh the short-term challenges. Their strategy will undoubtedly be watched closely by other corporate entities contemplating similar ventures. Conclusion: A New Chapter in Corporate Finance Sharplink Gaming’s decision to add a monumental $5 billion to its stock sale plan for Ethereum purchases marks a pivotal moment in the intersection of traditional finance and the burgeoning world of digital assets. This isn’t just another investment; it’s a clear declaration from a Nasdaq-listed company that Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies are becoming integral components of modern corporate treasury strategies. It reflects a growing conviction among forward-thinking businesses that digital assets are not merely speculative tools but strategic reserves capable of enhancing financial resilience and unlocking new avenues for growth in an increasingly digital economy. This bold move by Sharplink Gaming serves as a powerful testament to the increasing institutional confidence in the crypto space. It reinforces the narrative that digital assets are maturing and gaining mainstream acceptance, paving the way for more companies to follow suit. As the lines between traditional and decentralized finance continue to blur, Sharplink Gaming is positioning itself at the forefront of this transformative shift, potentially inspiring a new wave of corporate engagement with the crypto frontier.

The digital asset landscape is constantly shifting, driven by a myriad of factors, not least of which is the collective psyche of its participants. At the heart of understanding this ebb and flow lies a crucial indicator: the Crypto Fear & Greed Index . This fascinating tool offers a snapshot of the prevailing crypto market sentiment , helping investors gauge whether euphoria or panic reigns supreme. As of July 19, the index has climbed to a notable 74, firmly placing it in the ‘Greed’ zone. But what does this really mean for your crypto journey? Unveiling the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: What Does it Tell Us? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a brainchild of the software development platform Alternative, is more than just a number; it’s a barometer for the emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. Ranging from 0 to 100, this index distills complex market data into a single, digestible score: 0-24 (Extreme Fear): This indicates that investors are highly worried. Such periods often present buying opportunities for those brave enough to go against the crowd. 25-49 (Fear): While not as intense as extreme fear, this still suggests a cautious or bearish outlook among market participants. 50-74 (Greed): This is where the market currently sits at 74. It signifies growing optimism and a strong buying interest. However, it can also be a precursor to market corrections if euphoria becomes excessive. 75-100 (Extreme Greed): At this level, investors are often overly confident and may be making impulsive decisions. This phase can signal that the market is overheated and due for a pullback. The index aims to prevent investors from making irrational decisions driven by emotional responses. When the market is in ‘Extreme Fear’, it could be a sign of a buying opportunity for long-term investors. Conversely, when the market is in ‘Extreme Greed’, it might be a signal to take profits. Decoding Crypto Market Sentiment: The Six Pillars of the Index How does the index arrive at its score? It’s not just a gut feeling; it’s a sophisticated aggregation of six key market factors, each weighted differently to reflect its influence on overall crypto market sentiment . Understanding these components is essential to truly grasp the index’s insights: Factor Weighting Explanation Volatility 25% Measures current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing them with average values over 30 and 90 days. Higher volatility often indicates fear. Market Momentum/Volume 25% Analyzes the current volume and momentum of the market. High buying volumes in a positive market suggest greedy behavior. Social Media 15% Scans social media platforms (primarily Twitter) for keywords and hashtags related to cryptocurrency, assessing the sentiment of discussions. Surveys 15% Polls thousands of crypto investors each week to gather their direct perceptions of the market. (Note: This factor is currently paused.) Bitcoin Dominance 10% Examines Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market capitalization. A rising dominance can indicate a shift of funds from altcoins to Bitcoin, often seen as a safer haven in uncertain times. Google Trends 10% Analyzes Google search data for crypto-related terms. A surge in searches for terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” often signals fear, while “buy Bitcoin” suggests greed. Each factor contributes to the final score, providing a holistic view of the market’s emotional state. The current reading of 74 suggests a strong collective belief in upward price movement, but it’s vital to look beyond just the number. Navigating the ‘Greed’ Zone: Implications for Investor Sentiment The index’s climb to 74 and its consistent presence in the ‘Greed’ zone reflects a significant shift in investor sentiment . After periods of fear or uncertainty, a move into greed suggests renewed confidence and a willingness to take on more risk. This can be driven by positive news, a sustained price rally, or a general feeling of optimism spreading through the community. However, the ‘Greed’ zone, especially as it approaches ‘Extreme Greed’, comes with a caveat. Historically, periods of extreme euphoria have often preceded market corrections. When everyone is buying, and prices are soaring, the market can become overextended. This is when the fear of missing out (FOMO) kicks in, pushing even cautious investors to enter the market at potentially unsustainable levels. Smart investors often view extreme greed as a signal to exercise caution, rather than to jump in headfirst. The Crucial Role of Bitcoin Dominance in Market Dynamics One of the intriguing components of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is Bitcoin dominance . This metric measures Bitcoin’s market capitalization as a percentage of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. Why is it important? Flight to Safety: When Bitcoin dominance rises, it often indicates that investors are moving funds out of altcoins and into Bitcoin. This can happen during periods of uncertainty, as Bitcoin is generally perceived as a more stable and established asset compared to smaller, more volatile altcoins. Altcoin Season Indicator: Conversely, a declining Bitcoin dominance often signals an ‘altcoin season,’ where altcoins gain significant value relative to Bitcoin. This typically occurs during periods of high market confidence, as investors become more willing to take on higher risks for potentially higher rewards in the altcoin market. Impact on Index: A high Bitcoin dominance might contribute to a ‘Fear’ reading if it suggests a flight from riskier assets, while a lower dominance might contribute to ‘Greed’ if it indicates broad market confidence in altcoins. The current 10% weighting reflects its importance in gauging where capital is flowing within the crypto ecosystem. Monitoring Bitcoin dominance alongside the overall index provides a deeper understanding of underlying market movements and investor sentiment . Understanding Market Volatility: A Double-Edged Sword Market volatility is an inherent characteristic of the cryptocurrency space. Unlike traditional markets, crypto prices can swing wildly in short periods, offering both immense opportunities and significant risks. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index allocates a substantial 25% weighting to volatility, underscoring its importance. Fear vs. Greed through Volatility: Typically, very high volatility coupled with price drops often indicates fear, as investors panic sell. However, high volatility during an uptrend can also be a sign of greed, as rapid price increases attract speculative buying. Risk Assessment: For investors, understanding volatility is crucial for risk management. Periods of extreme volatility, whether up or down, require careful consideration of position sizing and stop-loss orders. Opportunities: While intimidating, volatility also creates opportunities for traders who can capitalize on rapid price movements. However, this requires a disciplined approach and a clear strategy. The index uses volatility as a key indicator because sharp movements, regardless of direction, tend to trigger strong emotional responses from investors, directly influencing overall crypto market sentiment . Actionable Insights: How to Use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Wisely While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a powerful tool, it should not be your sole guide for investment decisions. Think of it as a compass, not a map. Here are some actionable insights: Contrarian Investing: Many seasoned investors use the index as a contrarian indicator. When the index is in ‘Extreme Fear,’ it might be a good time to consider buying, as prices are likely depressed due to panic. Conversely, when it’s in ‘Extreme Greed,’ it might be a prudent time to consider taking some profits or reducing exposure, as the market could be overheated. Combine with Other Analysis: Always combine the index’s insights with fundamental analysis (understanding the project’s technology, team, and use case) and technical analysis (studying price charts and patterns). The index provides context for investor sentiment , but not the full picture of a crypto asset’s value. Risk Management: Use the index to gauge the overall market mood and adjust your risk exposure accordingly. In periods of high greed, consider tightening stop-losses or diversifying your portfolio to mitigate potential downturns. Long-Term Perspective: For long-term investors, the index can help identify periods of irrational exuberance or undue panic, allowing for more strategic entry or exit points rather than reacting to daily fluctuations. The current reading of 74 in the ‘Greed’ zone suggests a buoyant market. While this is positive, it also calls for a degree of caution and strategic planning to avoid getting swept up in potential euphoria. The Road Ahead: What to Watch For? The continued high reading of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index in the ‘Greed’ zone points to a prevailing optimism in the market. However, market dynamics are constantly evolving. Investors should keep an eye on several factors that could influence future readings: Macroeconomic Conditions: Global economic indicators, inflation rates, and interest rate decisions by central banks can significantly impact risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies. Regulatory Developments: New regulations or enforcement actions in major jurisdictions can quickly shift crypto market sentiment , potentially moving the index towards fear. Technological Advancements: Breakthroughs in blockchain technology or major upgrades to existing networks (like Ethereum’s continued development) can fuel positive sentiment. Whale Activity: Large transactions by institutional investors or ‘whales’ can signal significant shifts in market direction, influencing smaller investors. By staying informed about these broader influences, you can better anticipate shifts in the index and adjust your strategies accordingly. The index is a living, breathing reflection of the market’s collective mind, and understanding its nuances is key to navigating the exciting, yet challenging, world of crypto. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is an invaluable tool for anyone looking to understand the underlying psychology of the digital asset market. Its current position at 74, firmly in the ‘Greed’ zone, signals a period of robust optimism and buying interest. However, as we’ve explored, high greed levels can also be a signal for caution, urging investors to evaluate their positions and avoid succumbing to FOMO. By dissecting its components—from market volatility to Bitcoin dominance —and applying its insights with a balanced, informed approach, you can better navigate the unpredictable currents of the crypto world and make more strategic decisions. Remember, emotional intelligence is as crucial as financial intelligence in this dynamic landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool that measures the current emotional state of the cryptocurrency market, ranging from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed). It helps investors understand if the market is driven by panic or euphoria. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index calculated? The index is calculated using six key factors: volatility (25%), market momentum/volume (25%), social media (15%), surveys (15% – currently paused), Bitcoin dominance (10%), and Google Trends (10%). Each factor contributes to the final score. What does a ‘Greed’ reading (like 74) mean for investors? A ‘Greed’ reading, such as 74, indicates high optimism and strong buying interest in the crypto market. While positive, it can also signal that the market might be getting overheated, potentially leading to a correction. Savvy investors often use high greed as a prompt for caution or to consider profit-taking. Can the Crypto Fear & Greed Index predict market tops or bottoms? While the index is a powerful indicator of prevailing investor sentiment , it is not a perfect predictive tool. Historically, extreme fear often coincides with market bottoms, and extreme greed with market tops. However, it should be used in conjunction with other analytical tools and strategies, not as a standalone predictor. Is Bitcoin dominance the only factor that matters in the index? No, Bitcoin dominance is one of six factors, contributing 10% to the index’s score.

A significant development is unfolding as Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin, USDT, signals its readiness to navigate the complex landscape of U.S. financial regulations. This commitment, articulated by Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino, marks a pivotal moment for USDT’s presence in the United States and sets a precedent for other stablecoin issuers globally. Understanding the GENIUS Act: A Game Changer for USDT Regulation ? The recent signing of the GENIUS Act by U.S. President Donald Trump has introduced a new chapter for foreign stablecoin operations within the U.S. market. But what exactly is the GENIUS Act, and why is it so crucial for entities like Tether? The GENIUS Act, an acronym for the ‘Global Exchange for Non-U.S. Issuers of Unregistered Stablecoins Act’, aims to provide a structured regulatory pathway. Previously, foreign stablecoin issuers faced an ambiguous environment, often operating without clear guidelines or direct oversight from U.S. authorities. This new legislation seeks to: Establish Clear Guidelines: Offer a defined framework for foreign stablecoin issuers to register and operate legally within the U.S. Enhance Consumer Protection: Introduce measures to safeguard U.S. consumers engaging with foreign-issued stablecoins. Promote Financial Stability: Integrate these digital assets into the broader financial system in a way that minimizes systemic risks. For Tether, which currently issues USDT primarily from El Salvador, the GENIUS Act represents an opportunity to solidify its standing in one of the world’s largest financial markets. It’s a move that could transition USDT from a de facto presence to a formally recognized and regulated entity within the U.S. Tether’s Commitment to Tether Compliance : What Does It Mean? Paolo Ardoino’s recent interview with Decrypt highlighted Tether’s proactive approach to meeting the GENIUS Act’s requirements. This isn’t just a casual statement; it reflects a strategic decision to embrace regulation rather than resist it. Tether’s commitment to Tether compliance with this new law has several profound implications: Increased Legitimacy and Trust: Operating under a clear U.S. regulatory framework could significantly boost confidence among institutional investors, traditional financial entities, and retail users who may have previously been hesitant due to regulatory uncertainties. This could unlock new avenues for adoption and integration into mainstream financial services. Broader Market Access: Compliance means USDT could be more readily integrated into U.S.-based exchanges, payment processors, and financial applications. This expanded accessibility is vital for a stablecoin whose primary utility is to facilitate transactions and provide a stable store of value in the volatile crypto market. Setting a Precedent: As the dominant stablecoin, Tether’s move towards U.S. regulatory compliance could encourage other foreign stablecoin issuers to follow suit. This could lead to a more harmonized global regulatory environment for digital assets, benefiting the entire crypto ecosystem. Ardoino’s emphasis on commitment underscores a recognition that long-term success in the global financial landscape necessitates adherence to established legal frameworks. It’s a pragmatic approach to ensuring USDT’s continued relevance and growth. Why is US Crypto Regulation Becoming More Critical? The push for clearer US crypto regulation , exemplified by the GENIUS Act, is not happening in a vacuum. The U.S. government and financial regulators have increasingly focused on digital assets, particularly stablecoins, due to their growing market capitalization and potential impact on financial stability and monetary policy. Here are some reasons why regulation is paramount: Consumer Protection: Protecting investors from fraud, market manipulation, and the risks associated with unregulated financial products. Financial Stability: Ensuring that large stablecoin operations do not pose systemic risks to the traditional financial system, especially concerning reserves and liquidity. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) & Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF): Preventing the use of cryptocurrencies for illicit activities. Taxation: Establishing clear guidelines for reporting and taxing crypto transactions. Global Competitiveness: The U.S. aims to remain a leader in financial innovation while maintaining regulatory oversight. The GENIUS Act specifically addresses the unique challenges posed by foreign stablecoin issuers, acknowledging their significant role in the global crypto economy while ensuring they meet U.S. standards. What Challenges and Opportunities Lie Ahead for Stablecoin Issuers ? While the GENIUS Act offers a clear path, the journey to full compliance for stablecoin issuers like Tether will not be without its challenges. These may include: Operational Adjustments: Implementing new internal controls, reporting mechanisms, and audit procedures to meet U.S. standards. Reserve Management: Potentially adjusting reserve compositions and transparency levels to align with regulatory expectations. Legal and Compliance Costs: Significant investments in legal counsel, compliance officers, and technology to navigate the regulatory landscape. Jurisdictional Nuances: Reconciling regulations from their primary operating jurisdiction (e.g., El Salvador for Tether) with U.S. requirements. However, the opportunities far outweigh these challenges: Enhanced Credibility: Regulatory approval can significantly boost a stablecoin’s credibility, making it more attractive to a wider range of users and institutions. Innovation and Integration: With regulatory certainty, stablecoin issuers can focus on innovating new products and services, integrating more deeply into traditional finance and emerging Web3 applications. Competitive Advantage: Early movers who successfully achieve compliance may gain a significant competitive edge over those who delay or fail to adapt. Tether’s willingness to engage with the GENIUS Act is a testament to its long-term vision and belief in the future of regulated digital assets. The Future Landscape: USDT Regulation and Beyond The commitment to USDT regulation under the GENIUS Act signifies a maturing cryptocurrency market where regulatory frameworks are increasingly shaping operational strategies. This move by Tether could accelerate the broader acceptance of stablecoins as legitimate financial instruments, not just within the crypto ecosystem but also in traditional finance. We might see a future where: More Stablecoins Seek U.S. Compliance: Other foreign stablecoin issuers may follow Tether’s lead, leading to a more regulated and secure stablecoin market in the U.S. Increased Institutional Adoption: With regulatory clarity, more financial institutions may feel comfortable integrating stablecoins into their offerings, from cross-border payments to decentralized finance (DeFi) products. Innovation in Compliance Technology: The demand for regulatory technology (RegTech) solutions tailored for crypto assets will likely surge. Tether’s decision is not merely about gaining access; it’s about shaping the future of digital finance, demonstrating that even decentralized technologies can thrive within established regulatory boundaries. Conclusion: A New Era for Stablecoins in the U.S. Paolo Ardoino’s declaration of Tether’s intent to comply with the GENIUS Act marks a landmark moment for the stablecoin industry. It signals a strategic shift towards greater regulatory engagement and transparency, particularly within the crucial U.S. market. This move has the potential to enhance USDT’s legitimacy, expand its market reach, and set a powerful precedent for other stablecoin issuers navigating the evolving landscape of US crypto regulation . As the digital asset space continues to mature, such proactive steps towards Tether compliance and clarity will be instrumental in fostering trust, driving innovation, and unlocking the full potential of stablecoins as a bridge between traditional finance and the decentralized future.

As of the time of writing, ETH trades at $3,617, marking a 5.4% increase within the past 24 hours. This rally has been drawing attention from analysts who are examining whether the price movement is being driven by sustainable investor demand or short-term speculative activity. Related Reading: Ethereum Shorts Are Getting Crushed: Could ETH Be Eyeing a New All-Time High? Ethereum Futures Market Leads, But Spot Demand Lags Behind Data from on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant suggests the recent uptrend in Ethereum’s price is primarily fueled by the derivatives market. Contributor Avocado Onchain noted that while ETH continues to move higher, the underlying source of momentum appears to be leverage-heavy futures positions rather than sustained buying in the spot market. This distinction raises questions about the durability of the current rally and whether follow-through demand from spot buyers will emerge. Avocado further highlighted in his QuickTake analysis titled “Ethereum’s Rally Driven by Futures Market — Will Spot Demand Follow?” that the Ethereum Futures Volume Bubble Map is signaling an overheated state in specific zones, indicated by surging volumes. This increase in futures volume, marked by yellow circles on the map, has coincided with ETH’s price gains, implying leveraged positions are largely responsible for the rise. In contrast, the spot market data shows relative stability, with no equivalent spike in volume, suggesting that buying pressure from traditional investors has yet to catch up. The analyst also pointed out that Ethereum’s Open Interest (OI) in futures has reached new all-time highs, which strengthens the idea that the current movement is speculative in nature. The question moving forward, according to Avocado, is whether momentum from the derivatives market will eventually be matched by genuine spot market demand. If such demand materializes, it could contribute to broader altcoin market activity, he added. Institutional Interest and ETF Inflows In a separate insight, another CryptoQuant analyst, Crypto Dan, noted increasing signs of institutional participation in Ethereum accumulation. According to his analysis, ETH is trading at a premium on Coinbase, a platform frequently used by US-based institutions and large investors, indicating heightened buying interest from whales. The premium, described as rare in recent times, aligns with a broader trend of capital inflows into Ethereum-focused spot ETFs, which have recently reached record daily highs. Dan stated that while current metrics do not indicate overheating, investors should remain aware of potential risks should the strong upward activity repeat in the second half of 2025.

Then you know that innovation never sleeps. A groundbreaking development is on the horizon that promises to redefine how we think about staking and yield generation. Leading liquid restaking protocol, Ether.fi , is making a significant leap into the high-speed world of the HyperLiquid ecosystem, a move set to introduce a powerful new asset: the beHYPE token . This isn’t just another partnership; it’s a strategic alliance poised to unlock fresh opportunities and deepen the synergy between distinct blockchain environments. Let’s dive into what this collaboration means for the future of DeFi and how it could impact your crypto portfolio. Understanding the Core Players: Ether.fi and HyperLiquid To truly appreciate the significance of this collaboration, it’s essential to understand the unique strengths of the entities involved. Both Ether.fi and HyperLiquid represent cutting-edge advancements in their respective domains, and their coming together creates a formidable force. What is Ether.fi? Powering Liquid Restaking Ether.fi stands out as a pioneering liquid restaking protocol built on Ethereum. But what exactly is liquid restaking, and why is it such a hot topic in the crypto space? In simple terms, restaking allows users to re-stake their already staked ETH (or liquid staking tokens like stETH) on other protocols to earn additional rewards. This creates a layered security model and enhances capital efficiency. Capital Efficiency: Users can earn multiple layers of yield from their staked ETH, rather than just one. Decentralized Security: By restaking, users contribute to the security of multiple protocols simultaneously. Liquid Tokens: Protocols like Ether.fi issue liquid restaking tokens (LRTs) that represent your restaked assets. This means your capital remains liquid and can be used in other DeFi applications while still earning staking rewards. Ether.fi has quickly gained traction for its user-friendly approach and robust infrastructure, making it a go-to platform for those looking to maximize their ETH’s utility. What is HyperLiquid? The High-Performance DeFi Powerhouse On the other side of this exciting partnership is HyperLiquid , a decentralized layer-1 blockchain that has been making waves with its ultra-fast execution and innovative approach to perpetuals trading. Unlike many other blockchains, HyperLiquid is built from the ground up for performance, offering: High Throughput: Capable of processing a massive volume of transactions per second, making it ideal for demanding applications like decentralized exchanges. Low Latency: Trades execute almost instantly, providing a seamless experience comparable to centralized exchanges. Native Perpetual DEX: HyperLiquid’s core focus is on perpetual futures trading, offering deep liquidity and a wide range of assets. The network’s architecture is designed to handle the rigorous demands of high-frequency trading, positioning it as a strong contender in the competitive DeFi landscape. HyperBeat, a native project within the HyperLiquid ecosystem, plays a crucial role in facilitating this integration by providing the necessary infrastructure and yield strategies. The Vision Behind beHYPE: A New Liquid Staking Token The core of this collaboration is the introduction of the beHYPE token . This new liquid staking token is designed to bridge the gap between Ether.fi’s liquid restaking capabilities and HyperLiquid’s high-performance ecosystem. But what exactly is beHYPE, and what benefits does it bring to users? Unpacking the Utility of beHYPE Token The beHYPE token will serve as a representation of Ether.fi’s liquid restaked ETH within the HyperLiquid network. This means that users will be able to: Access HyperLiquid’s DeFi Ecosystem: With beHYPE, users can participate in various DeFi protocols and strategies native to HyperLiquid, such as providing liquidity, collateralizing loans, or engaging in yield farming. Earn Dual Rewards: Holders of beHYPE could potentially earn rewards from both Ether.fi’s underlying restaking activities and additional yield opportunities within HyperLiquid. This ‘double-dipping’ potential is a significant draw for yield-hungry investors. Enhanced Liquidity: By creating a liquid representation of restaked assets on HyperLiquid, beHYPE enhances the overall liquidity of these assets, making them more versatile and accessible. The strategic design of beHYPE aims to create a symbiotic relationship, where Ether.fi users gain access to HyperLiquid’s speed and liquidity, and HyperLiquid benefits from the influx of restaked capital and user base. Why This Collaboration Matters: Unlocking New DeFi Opportunities The partnership between Ether.fi and HyperLiquid is more than just a technical integration; it represents a significant step forward for the broader DeFi landscape. It addresses key challenges and opens up exciting new avenues for users and protocols alike. Bridging Ecosystems for Enhanced Capital Efficiency One of the persistent challenges in DeFi has been the fragmentation of liquidity and utility across different blockchain ecosystems. This collaboration directly tackles this by creating a seamless bridge for restaked assets to flow into a high-performance Layer 1. This means: Increased Capital Flow: Restaked ETH, which might otherwise be confined to the Ethereum ecosystem, can now find new utility and yield opportunities on HyperLiquid. Diversified Yield Strategies: Users are no longer limited to yield strategies available on a single chain.

33767162,[object Object],1752886822,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Michael Saylor Reveals The Only Thing ‘Better Than Bitcoin’ As MSTR Stock Outperforms,https://bitcoinist.com/only-thing-better-than-bitcoin/,"Doubling down on his unwavering belief in the leading cryptocurrency, MicroStrategy’s founder Michael Saylor , has declared that the only thing better than Bitcoin (BTC) is more Bitcoin. Backed by real data, Saylor’s bold conviction appears justified, with MicroStrategy stock (MSTR) spiking rapidly and outperforming BTC’s rally. MSTR Outpaces Bitcoin And Wall Street Giants Saylor is reinforcing his long-held stance on Bitcoin, now claiming in a recent X social media post that the only thing better than BTC in recent years is acquiring more of the flagship cryptocurrency. According to data from a well-curated horizontal bar chart by Strategy B, MicroStrategy’s stock has delivered an eye-popping 3,588% return during what’s being called the “Bitcoin Standard era.” More interestingly, the charts also show that MicroStrategy’s impressive pump has far outpaced Bitcoin’s price surge , which recorded a 905% gain over the same period. This stark contrast underscores a more than 3X outperformance by MSTR compared to BTC, highlighting the amplified returns from Saylor’s aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy . Notably, Saylor’s bold assertion that “the only thing better than Bitcoin is more Bitcoin” reflects not only the amazing performance of the cryptocurrency but also the exponential effect of aligning corporate strategy around it. This era-defining performance has placed MSTR at the top of the chart, eclipsing even Wall Street giants and traditional equity benchmarks such as QQQ (up 106%), SPY (up 86%), and GLD (up 62%). Even more striking is the underperformance of Real Estate (VNQ) and bond funds (BND), which delivered just 9% and 19% gains, respectively—a stark contrast in a market where capital allocation has never mattered more. Over the past few years, MicroStrategy has taken an unapologetically competitive approach towards Bitcoin accumulation, converting large portions of its balance sheet into BTC and using both equity and convertible debt to purchase more coins . While the flagship cryptocurrency remains the best-performing asset of the decade by most traditional standards, Saylor’s leveraged BTC play through MSTR has proven to be one of the most explosive and profitable bets . MSTR Stocks Hit Highest Market Cap Value On July 16, Saylor took to X again to announce that MSTR stocks have reached its highest market capitalization to date, closing the day at $455.90 per share after a 3.05% jump. This development marks a major milestone for the company, which now commands a total market cap of $128.5 billion and an enterprise value of $140.2 billion. Notably, the rally is being driven by strong performance in both MSTR shares and BTC, which the company has accumulated in large amounts over the past few years. MicroStrategy’s valuation is anchored in its massive Bitcoin reserve of 601,550 BTC, now worth more than $72.1 billion. With the cryptocurrency priced at $119,887 at the time of the post, Saylor’s leveraged bet has outpaced the asset’s performance. MSTR has also gained 174% over the past year, while trading activity remains high, reflected in its average 30-day volume of $5.41 billion.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|BND|Bond Funds|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|GLD|michael saylor|MicroStrategy Stock|mstr|qqq|real estate|spy|VNQ,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-07-19 01:00:22

Trump’s departure from long-standing US positions on free trade and defense has rattled confidence in the dollar—the world’s dominant reserve and trade currency—sending shockwaves through global markets. The uncertainty has also reached lawmakers, who debate whether continued reliance on dollar distribution is sustainable amid rising economic risks. Uncertainties surround the US dollar as nations rethink their reliance on the country The US Federal Reserve has asserted that the central bank will continue using dollars in its operations. However, following Trump’s policy shift , the US’s European trading partners are rethinking their reliance on the country. The European regulators have gone to the extent of triggering the Bank of England, the central bank responsible for maintaining monetary and economic stability for the country, to emphasize to lenders the urgency of assessing their dollar funding approach in their operations. Moreover, according to sources familiar with the situation, it has also requested them to examine their reliance on the currency for short-term needs. Considering the intense nature of the situation, a Britain-based global bank was recently requested to conduct an internal stress test on the possibility of a shutdown for the US dollar swap market. Richard Portes, an economics professor at London Business School and a former Chair of the Advisory Scientific Committee for the European Systemic Risk Board, mentioned that in a worldwide dollar funding crisis, the Fed may be reluctant to provide swaps due to concerns about a strong reaction from Trump. Portes explained that the Fed mainly focuses on keeping monetary policy independent. He further urged the supervisors of foreign banks to encourage their banks to reduce their dollar exposures drastically. In response to Portes’s statement, the Prudential Regulation Authority, the supervisory part of the Bank of England, requested separate information from several banks concerning the situation, people with knowledge of the matter who wished to remain anonymous due to the confidential nature of the situation said. When asked to comment, neither the Bank of England’s representative nor the global UK banks ‘ spokespersons that operate in banks such as HSBC, Standard Chartered, and Barclays respond to a request for comments. Contrastingly, a spokesperson from the White House responded to a request for comment. In a statement, the spokesperson mentioned that during President Trump’s administration, several markets and investors demonstrated strong confidence in the US dollar. The spokesperson based the argument on the increase in bonds, stocks, and historic investments that have increased to trillions of dollars since Trump’s election day. Analysts express concerns about the US Fed’s financial stance Earlier assessment of internal stress test on the US dollar revealed that euro zone banks required approximately one-fifth of the currency in their operations. The assessment also revealed that they highly rely on financial borrowing from short-term markets, which are unreliable in an economic crisis. For example, European central banks have significantly borrowed funds from the US Federal Reserve. This is where the US dollar comes from, highlighting their reliance on the currency to fill their financial gaps. Interestingly, the US Fed has several loan programs that apply to the ECB, among other US partners. This aims to address the global US dollar shortage and prevent the effects of financial hardship from hitting the country. Two reliable sources have highlighted that the US Fed never stopped indicating support for these safety precautions. Despite this, some sources suggest the possibility of the Fed shifting this stance. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.
